After taking charge of the party, she had pledged to take forward the legacy of the former Chief Minister. \nEver since Jayalalithaa's death, there has been a clamour that Sasikala should follow the earlier practice of both the party General Secretary and the Chief Minister's post being vested with the same person. \nWhen she addressed the party legislators, Sasikala was clad in the signature green sari and blouse emulating the late Jayalalithaa. \nOpposition party DMK expressed shock that the AIADMK had chosen an administratively inexperienced Sasikala as the CM of Tamil Nadu. \nBharatiya Janata Party's Tamil Nadu President Tamilisai Soundararajan agreed that electing Sasikala was the AIADMK MLAs' right but wondered what was the urgency. \nDMK working president Stalin today alleged that there were mysteries surrounding late chief minister J Jayalalithaa's treatment and the election of Sasikala as the legislature party leader, and said these would \"soon come before the people\". \n' Jayalaltihaa's death unexpected, no conspiracy' \nLondon-based doctor Richard Beale, who treated Jayalalithaa until she died in December, today ruled out any \"conspiracy\" behind her death. \nAddressing the media here, Beale said: \"There was no conspiracy. She (Jayalalithaa) had severe infection. She had supportive care.\" \nAhead of AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala being sworn in as Chief Minister, the Tamil Nadu government organised the media meet involving Beale and doctors from Apollo Hospitals to clear the air surrounding the death of Jayalalithaa. \nAlso Read - No poisoning, no conspiracy in Jayalalithaa's death: UK-based London doctor \nSC to give verdict in one week in Jaya DA case \nIn a verdict that can have implications for Sasikala, the Supreme Court is likely to pronounce next week its verdict on the Karnataka government's plea challenging the acquittal of late Jayalalithaa, her close aide Sasikala and others in a disproportionate assets case, by the state High Court. \nAlso Read - Tamil Nadu: Sasikala's husband M Natarajan hospitalised for breathing trouble \nThe bench headed by Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose said 'Wait till next week' - as senior counsel Dushyant Dave appearing for Karnataka said that the main accused has already passed away and another accused Sasikala is expected to become Chief Minister soon.
