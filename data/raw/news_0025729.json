By now, everyone knows about the star’s love of body bling, a great plunging neckline, and a thigh-high slit, but Lopez always finds new ways to keep her look fresh. At the 2017 Grammys, Lopez arrived in a candy pink creation from Ralph & Russo’s Spring 2017 couture collection that turned heads. With its cutesy color and swaths of tulle, the gown seemed girlish when presented on the runway, but on Lopez it was a bombshell showstopper that hugged her every curve. Worn with a handful of Repossi diamonds and a matching sequined clutch, her pastel moment was arresting. It’s been almost two decades since Lopez first electrified audiences—and inspired Google to launch an image-finding feature—with her revealing Versace gown at the Grammys in 2000. In the years since then, she’s developed a personal look so popular that it has spawned countless imitations, but she remains the master of red-carpet seduction.
