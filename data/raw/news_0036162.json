upset after knocking out Newcastle in the last round. 4 Oxford boss Michael Appleton believe she has learn from his tough background \nHis stock with the fans is at an all-time high following promotion to League One last season and an impressive campaign this term. \nKeep up to date with ALL the FA Cup news \nBut after making self-confessed errors in taking jobs at crisis clubs Blackpool, Blackburn and Portsmouth, Appleton insists it would take something extra special to ditch the good thing he has going at the Kassam Stadium. \nThe ex- West Brom coach, 41, said: “I’ve definitely learnt that the grass isn’t always greener. \n“I’ve probably found that out the hard way but that can often be the best thing to happen to you. \n“There have been many opportunities over the last 2½ years to leave and I have an open relationship with my chairman Daryl Eales. \n“It would take a very good side and a very good offer to tempt me away from Oxford, as long as we continue to be competitive and I continue to get the opportunity to make us competitive.” \nAppleton has had to rebuild his reputation at Oxford following short spells at Blackpool and Blackburn. PA:Press Association 4 Appleton hopes to complete a north-east double in the FA Cup by beating Boro \nHaving left administration-hit Pompey for Blackpool in November 2012, he quit the Seasiders after just 65 days for Rovers. \nBut it was a case of out of the frying pan and into the fire, and he lasted only 67 days. \nIt was to be another 16 months before he would get back into the game in July 2014 with Oxford, where he has been ever since. \nAppleton, who began at Manchester United as a teenager, added: “A lot of people have made judgments on myself around the Blackpool and Blackburn situation which was a poor decision on my behalf. Getty Images 4 Boro manager Aitor Karanka is keen to avoid a shock and reach the quarter-finals \n“What I would have done differently, and will do differently if I get jobs in management, is do my due diligence a bit better. \n“As a young coach leaving West Brom you think you can take on the world and the reality is a lot of things have to fall in place for you to be successful. \n“But whoever the top six managers in the world are, I’d be amazed if they would have done anything different at Blackpool, Blackburn or even Pompey. \n“I think the timing was crucial of going to those clubs, where there were a lot of issues which were very, very difficult to control.” RELATED STORIES Sleepy Lee...but will the defender's error cost his side?
