But as a youngster he looked up to a fellow legend but in a very different position. \nIt's crazy to think that Ramos didn't start life with Real considering how synonymous he's become with the club since joining them 12 years ago. \nThe defender started life at Sevilla, playing two seasons for the La Liga club, before moving to the Bernabeu aged 19. \nSince then he's had an incredible career winning three league titles and two Champions Leagues, making a telling contribution in both finals. \nSpeaking in a Q&A Ramos revealed his footballing hero was a former Real Madrid star but a striker in the form of Ronaldo: \n\"When I started out I was more a fan of attacking players and one in particular, the Brazilian Ronaldo. \" \nConsidering his penchant for late goals, and the fact that he's got six league goals in 13 starts this season, it's not actually that surprising that Ramos loved a striker. \nAnd Ronaldo wasn't the only one either. Ramos also admitted to looking up to former Rangers and Argentina striker Claudio Caniggia, partially for a very different reason: \n\"Another of my idols was Claudio Caniggia, an Argentine forward with long hair whom I liked a lot. \n\"It's because of him I started to grow my hair long.\" \nWho is your footballing hero?
