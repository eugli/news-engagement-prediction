City officials have said they would undertake the flood-control projects even without that deal because of poor drainage in the Montclair and Park Hill basins, but opponents argue I-70 is the true impetus. \nOpponents also say the expensive flood projects are diverting the city’s attention from addressing big flood-control needs elsewhere, including in Globeville . \nPublic Works spokeswoman Nancy Kuhn said Tuesday that not all of the rate increase will go to the Platte to Park Hill work, with other drainage and water-quality projects set to benefit across the city. The Denver Post reported previously that the Platte to Park Hill projects would receive $206 million of the $383 million projected to be raised for storm drainage work through the rate increase and borrowing. \nA request for comment from the city attorney’s office about the councilman’s intention to join the lawsuit wasn’t immediately returned. \nAttorney Aaron Goldhamer said he also planned to request the addition of several other Denver residents as plaintiffs: LaMone Noles, Sarah Edgell, Vida Hughes, Christine O’Connor, David Torres, Theresa Johnson and Heather Strack. \nGoldhamer is representing original plaintiff J.D. MacFarlane, a former Colorado attorney general, in the lawsuit, which contends Denver is trying unlawfully to convert the golf course to a non-park use. \nThe suit survived its first major legal hurdle in November when a Denver District Court judge denied the city’s motion to dismiss the case . A trial is set for Aug. 21. \nPlatte to Park Hill’s main components are detention areas on the City Park and Park Hill golf courses, a drainage channel north of 39th Avenue and a replacement outfall into the South Platte River at Globeville Landing Park, now under construction.
