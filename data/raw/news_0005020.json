GETTY Mrs Merkel and Mrs May visited St John's Cathedral today ahead of talks \nAnd Mrs Merkel was snubbed for a meeting with Mr Trump, having only spoken to the US president by phone. \nThe under-fire chancellor is facing an uphill struggle in her hopes for cohesion among her colleagues in the EU however. \nShe is facing mounting pressure from countries struggling to cope with her open door migrant policy. \nMrs Merkel has been forced to u-turn on her \"no limit\" refugee policy after revealing this week she is to spend £37bn in taxpayer's money on the crisis in Germany alone this year. \nIllegal trafficking has become rife since Mrs Merkel announced that she would ensure every asylum seeker coming to Germany would get a fair hearing in September 2015. \nBut as countries like Italy, Greece, Sweden, France, Malta and others struggle to cope with the crippling demands of people trying to get to Europe she has been forced to u-turn. \nGermany recently passed laws which will limit the number of people, including refugees, who will be able to travel to the country. \nIt comes as Mrs Merkel is also facing a backlash from the public reeling from a string of terror attacks including the Christmas market attack in Berlin attacks that killed 12 just weeks ago. \nSpeaking to media ahead of the conference she said she intended to update on a new \"European asylum system\" designed to expedite the removal of criminals. \nMrs Merkel is reiterating the EU's continued commitment to trying to tackle the problem as it attempts to close off its borders albeit without the same reaction that was sparked when Donald Trump made an executive order to limit migration from seven countries to the United States last week. \nShe said: \"This is a special summit that will look at the questions of migration, especially with the central Mediterranean and therefore also with Libya. \n\"We need a political solution for a stable Libya, we have a lot of work to do that is so far not the case. \n\"We are supporting the government of Mr Sarraj but we need a political solution. \n\"And we will also try to improve the situation for the refugees in Libya. GETTY Alexis Tsipras, Charles Michel, Francois Hollande, Angela Merkel, Paolo Gentiloni, Andrej Plenkovic \n\"We will discuss the new European asylum system, I believe that all in all we are very well prepared to make the next steps. \n\"The second step in the council of the 27 we will talk about the preparations for the [Treaty of] Rome. \nThe Chancellor’s struggling administration has unveiled a raft of new laws in parliament to help cope with the escalating European migrant crisis.
