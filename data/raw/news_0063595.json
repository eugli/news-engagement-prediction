The 22-year-old singer-songwriter, who grew up in rural Maryland fairly unexposed to pop music, is referring to the unexpected moment she became an online sensation last year after one of her songs brought Pharrell Williams to tears. A video of the Grammy-winning producer teaching a music masterclass at NYU went viral after his visceral reaction to a track Rogers wrote, sang and produced, called \"Alaska.\" Williams shook his head and his eyes reddened as the song got to the chorus, and when it finished, he said to her surprise: \"Wow. I have zero notes for that.\" The song wasn't even finished; it was just a demo. At the time of writing, the video has over 2.4 million views on YouTube and \"Alaska\" has over 27 million streams on Spotify. By the end of 2016, Rogers was in Best of the Year roundups by The New Yorker to Pigeons and Planes, and on Artists to Watch lists in 2017 by BBC and Vevo Discover.\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/TyimCGEkiUc?start=0&enablejsapi=1&origin=http://www.harpersbazaar.com&autoplay=0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0u7lXy7pDg"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:14:44.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
