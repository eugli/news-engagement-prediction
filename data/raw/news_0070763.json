But his fine-dining flagship went on to put Mexico City on the map as an international dining destination, and next week, after two years of construction, he will unveil the brand-new Pujol, with an updated location, look and menu — including a 10-seat taco omakase, the city’s first ever taco tasting menu. Like many chefs, Olvera is deeply influenced by Japan, and the idea for his taco omakase was inspired by the unparalleled craftsmanship he witnessed at Japan’s top sushi bars where chefs dedicate the entirety of their careers to perfecting a single bite of rice and fish. “When I go to Japan I want to have the best sushi I’ve ever had in my life,” he says. “And when people come to Mexico, they want to have the best taco.” Here, the chef breaks down his first omakase. Image Credit Araceli Paz Cauliflower Taco Tortillas are the backbone of Olvera’s omakase menu. The chef sources White Bolita corn from Oaxaca — and then transforms it into masa, which is hand-pressed into tortillas and cooked on a comal, a traditional Mexican griddle designed by the restaurant’s architect Javier Sánchez. “Our philosophy is similar to sushi,” Olvera says, “we are focusing on the corn and the process of making the most beautiful tortilla just as you would rice in the nigiri.” (Handmade tortillas are also integral to the menu at Olvera’s New York City restaurant, Cosme, which opened in 2015.) Image Credit Araceli Paz Grilled Seabass Taco The ingredients that fill Olvera’s tortillas travel to the restaurant from seemingly all 31 states in Mexico, with sea bass (above) coming from Northern Baja, octopus from Campeche and crab from Veracruz. Greens and herbs are grown much closer to home, either in Pujol’s kitchen garden or on a small plot the restaurant farms south of the city in Xochimilco. Image Credit Araceli Paz Ribeye Taco When fine-tuning the menu, Olvera and his team focused more on execution than creativity. “If you think back on the best taco you’ve ever had,” he says, “it was the best tortilla you’ve ever had and the best beef you’ve ever had and it was cooked to perfection.” (In this ribeye taco, the wagyu beef is San Gabriel free range, from the Canatlán municipality of Durango, Mexico .) And like the thousands of taquerias and street stalls that crowd Mexico City’s urban landscape, the cooks at Pujol also focused their creativity on salsas, which will be served as a trio — one raw, one boiled and one charred.

Pujol’s omakase dance will be performed four times daily, twice at lunch and twice again at dinner. The $95 tasting includes between five and six tacos with beer pairings, as well asbotanas (snacks) and a cocktail when you sit down. “People have ideas that a taco should be cheap,” Olvera says, “but we are using the same lobster that gets sent to Japan for sushi restaurants, therefore we should be judged against the best sushi restaurants.” Interactive T Magazine Newsletter Sign up for a weekly compendium of exquisite and exclusive fashion, design, food, interiors and travel coverage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:26:17.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
