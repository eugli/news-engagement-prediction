As soon as the show opened to the press, we headed straight to the Sigma booth for some hands on time. Three of the lenses announced are part of Sigma's high-end 'Art' series including the 24-70mm F2.8 you see above, as well as a 135mm F1.8 and a 14mm F1.8. \nSigma also announced a 100-400mm F5-6.3 DG OS HSM lens which is part of the company's more modestly-priced 'Contemporary' series. \nClick through the gallery for hands on photos of each lens and some initial impressions of build quality, size and weight.
