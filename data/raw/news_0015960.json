The Government of Canada is committed to the safety and security of the Canadian public.

Canada has been an attractive destination from across the world including first world and developed country. Immigration has also played a key role in Canada’s economic success over the years. “Immigration plays a key role in contributing to Canada's well-being, to our economic prosperity, and to our success as a nation… We are confident in our immigration programs and will continue to ensure that our immigration system balances compassion, efficiency and economic opportunity, while protecting the health, safety and security of Canadians,” an official in the Canadian Immigration Minister’s office told ET. According to Ahmed D Hussen Canada’s new immigration Minister, \"Our principles are openness, open to new ideas, open to people, open to those who want to come here and make a better life for themselves, contribute to our economy through their high skills and to also have the compassion to continue to have the compassion for those who seek sanctuary in our country\". Hussen is originally from Somalia who to Canada in 1993 and rose to become a Minister. Canada welcomes immigrants without discrimination from around the world through a variety of immigration programs that support Canada's diversity and helps grow economy, a Canadian official said, adding, the contributions of all newcomers result in jobs, innovation and economic growth.” All applicants who apply to Canada's immigration programs are treated equally no matter where they are from and anyone can emigrate to Canada provided they meet the qualifications, claimed a Canadian immigrant department official who did not wish to be quoted.
