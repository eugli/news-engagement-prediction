Senior Inspector Lau Cheuk-ngai, 31; Detective Sergeant Pak Wing-bun, 43; Constable Lau Hing-pui, 39; and detective constables Wong Wai-ho, 38; Chan Siu-tan, 33; and Kwan Ka-ho, 33.\nThey walked into the dock in matching suits and ties at 9.36am.\nChief Inspector Wong smiled at his counsel Lawrence Lok Ying-kam upon sitting down, while Senior Inspector Lau and Pak were seen looking intently at the public gallery.\nLok said more than 1,000 letters from various sectors of society poured in over the past two days and asked the court to take time to read them.\n“They all feel very strongly for these defendants,” he said.\nBut judge David Dufton proceeded immediately to deliver his sentence, which was translated into Cantonese for the defendants.\n\n“There can be no doubt that police officers including the defendants were working under great pressure during the Occupy Movement,” the judge said.\nHe noted however that the defendants had “not only brought dishonour to the police force,” but also “brought damage to Hong Kong’s reputation in the international community ... the assault having been viewed around the world.”\n“The assault is a vicious assault,” Dufton continued. “Although Tsang broke the law ... and the police officers worked under immense stress ... there was no justification to assault Tsang.\n“The assault is too serious to be of the position of a suspended sentence.”\nHong Kong police chief ‘saddened’ by conviction of seven officers in Occupy assault case \nThe judge had originally imposed a sentence of two years and six months, but he reduced it to two years after taking into account the defendants’ clear record, service to the community, stress from the long trial and during the Occupy Movement as well as their dismissal from the force and loss of pension.\nChan, who was found guilty of twice slapping Tsang, was meanwhile sentenced to an additional month’s imprisonment for common assault, to be served concurrently.\nThe seven did not react to the sentence.\nBut a non-family member wailed as she walked out of the courtroom.\n“It’s really unfair to the police,” she said as another tear rolled down her cheeks. “Tsang was not innocent. I can’t stop myself from crying.”\nMeanwhile, pro-democracy activist Lui Yuk-lin clapped in the public gallery and called out: “Good job, judge!”\nShe later joined a dozen protesters outside court, who held yellow umbrellas and chanted, “wise judge, wise judge”.\nAt the other side of the entrance, Innes Tang Tak-shing, chairman of pro-government activist group PolitiHK Social Strategic, with two pink hearts for police pinned to his chest, said he was disappointed by the harsh sentence and vowed to take his dissatisfaction to the streets on Saturday.\n“[The sentence] is so severe that it’s unbelievable,” he told reporters. “They should see how angry we are.”\nProtesters are expected to march from Chater Garden to the police headquarters in Wan Chai at 3pm on Saturday.\nSome 260 people have already signed up, but Tang expects more will join following the sentence.\nLok said outside court that his client would definitely appeal.\n\nAngry crowds supporting the seven policemen had been making abusive remarks about the judge since the conviction, and continued to do so despite the justice department’s pledge to follow up on such behaviour.\nDozens of police supporters began to gather outside the District Court in Wan Chai at about 8am – an hour and a half before the sentencing.\nBanners depicting the conviction as an injustice were hung up near the court entrance. A few smaller banners featured Dufton’s portrait over which a dog’s face had been placed, describing him as a “slave” from the West.\nPolice on high alert asked a separate group of people who were against the convicted policemen to stay away from their supporters.\nOfficers urged the two groups to stay calm and lower their voices when shouting slogans.\nPolice supporters holding the banners did not respond when they were asked whether they had learned of the news about Department of Justice’s follow-up concerning detractors of the court.\nProtesters against the policemen erupted into cheers outside the court as soon as they learned of the sentence.\n“Appeal! Appeal!” police supporters chanted in response to the news.\nAn angry man charged at the police detractors and grabbed a banner before officers separated him from the group.\nSeven policemen convicted of assaulting Occupy activist Ken Tsang \nThe case centred on one of the most controversial scenes of the 79-day pro-democracy civil disobedience movement in 2014 when seven plainclothes officers were caught on film assaulting Tsang outside an electricity substation for four minutes in the small hours of October 15.\nAt the time Tsang had been pepper-sprayed and zip-tied following his arrest for pouring liquid over uniformed police carrying out a clearance operation in Admiralty.\nNews footage of Tsang curled up on the floor apparently protecting himself against kicks, punches and baton hits by officers circulated quickly, leading to the site becoming widely known as the “dark corner”.\nSubsequent medical examination found the social worker suffered swelling and reddish bruises to his face, neck, shoulder, flank, chest and back.\n\nJudge Dufton concluded in a 224-page judgment that Tsang was a reliable witness when he testified that he had been frogmarched to the substation and immediately assaulted in a detour from the standard procedure of being taken to a police van.\nThe judge was also convinced beyond doubt that news footage of the incident had accurately captured all seven defendants on camera.\nDefence lawyers seek suspended prison sentences for police officers over assault of Ken Tsang \nBut he did not accept the assault had caused Tsang grievous bodily harm and so lowered the charge from the original one of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.\n\nChan was further convicted of common assault for twice slapping Tsang at Central Police Station when he was said to have refused to unlock his phone.\nPolice Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung said on Wednesday he felt saddened by the officers’ convictions.\n“I believe all of us were saddened,” he wrote in a letter to colleagues. “However, we must bear in mind that Hong Kong is governed by the rule of law, and our judicial system has an established appeal mechanism.”\nTsang was jailed for five weeks in a separate trial at Kowloon City Court last May over one count of assaulting police and two of resisting police.\nHe was immediately released on bail, pending an appeal against his conviction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:26:19.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
