Fox Sports 1’s Skip Bayless certainly is not in that camp . In fact, he doesn’t even consider Belichick a great coach. \nSpeaking on FS1’s “Undisputed” on Thursday, Bayless cited Belichick’s struggles as the Cleveland Browns head coach as a knock on his legacy, and that the Patriots head coach owes a lot of his success to Tom Brady. \n“I don’t think he’s a great coach,” Bayless said, as transcribed by WEEI. “I think he’s a very good one. All I know is that in his first six years of head coaching, he had five losing seasons before Tom Brady fell out of the sky and into his lap. And by the way, in that year of 2001, with Bill Belichick as the head coach, he had fallen to 0-2 and I know various assistants on his staff were ready to put their house on the market because they all thought they were going to get fired after they went 5-11 the previous year … if he’s an all-time great coach, he would have been better than he was in Cleveland. Tom Brady saved his job and turned around his career.” \nWhile Brady and Belichick both are integral parts of the Patriots’ long run of success, saying that Brady “saved” Belichick’s job might be a bit of a stretch. \nWe have a feeling Bayless is in the minority with this opinion, at least in the New England region. \nThumbnail photo via Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:47:25.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
