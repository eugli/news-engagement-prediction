Coachella too expensive? European festivals like Lowlands, Bilbao BBK Live and Lolla Paris all offer sun, sea and sounds.

You also get to visit somewhere new and broaden your cultural horizons. \nBetter yet, the majority of festivals in Europe are near major airports that you can fly to directly from Manchester. Meaning you can travel from the North of England to central Germany in less than half the time you’d spend in a traffic jam outside Glastonbury. \nWhether you want to hear dance on the beach of Croatia or get lost in the woods in Latvia, here are some of the most interesting festivals to visit in 2017.
