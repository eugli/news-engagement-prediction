Share via Twitter The Washington Post / Getty Images High school wrestler Mack Beggs won the University Interscholastic League (UIL) state championship in Texas on Saturday, making him the first transgender boy to win a girls’ state wrestling title in the league, CNN reports. \"I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for my teammates,\" Beggs, a junior at Trinity High School in Euless, Texas, told reporters after he won. \"We trained hard every single day, and that's what the spotlight should've been on—not me.\" Beggs, who was assigned female at birth, came out as transgender five years ago. In October 2015, he started medical treatment that includes doses of the male sex hormone testosterone to physically transition, CNN says, noting that some critics say that gives him an unfair advantage over the girls he competes against. Despite the attention and criticism, Beggs says he’s been treated well at his school, adding, “the staff, the teachers, the administration are all very supportive.” However, the UIL, which sets guidelines for extracurricular academic, athletic, and music contests in Texas-based public schools, will only let him wrestle girls, despite his wish to compete against other boys. The UIL released a statement on February 22 that says wrestlers can only compete against their own gender as “determined based on a student's birth certificate.” The organization notes that the rule on birth certificates was placed on a referendum ballot in 2016, and 95 percent of school superintendents voted in favor of it. The UIL also states that people can amend their birth certificates and that they will recognize that change. However, that process requires a court order, which can cost thousands of dollars and still ultimately get rejected . Some sports organizations have set guidelines to clarify competition categories for transgender athletes. MMA fighter Fallon Fox, a transgender woman, has repeatedly faced criticism for fighting against other women despite undergoing hormone replacement therapy , and gender confirmation surgery , a surgical procedure or series of procedures that help give a transgender person the physical body parts linked to the gender with which they identify. Chris Mosier also made headlines in 2016 after he became the first transgender man to earn a spot on the U.S. sprint duathlon men’s team. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) published guidelines in early 2016 that say transgender athletes should not be required to undergo gender confirmation surgery in order to compete in the Olympics. (Previous criteria stated that transgender athletes could only compete in the Olympics if they had undergone gender confirmation surgery, as well as hormone replacement therapy.) However, the new guidelines state that transgender male athletes should be eligible to participate in men’s competitions “without restriction,” while transgender female athletes should be required to prove that their testosterone levels have been below the required cutoff for at least 12 months before their first competition. The current UIL guidelines put Beggs in an unfair situation, experts say. Since Beggs is undergoing hormone replacement therapy, he, like other boys his age, has testosterone in his system. “It would do what it does with all the other boys—change muscles and increase body hair, as his body matures to a male body as opposed to a female body,” Michelle Forcier, M.D., a faculty member of the Physicians for Reproductive Health Adolescent Reproductive and Sexual Health Education Program (ARSHEP) , tells SELF. However, she says, the main problem is that he’s forced to wrestle as a girl when he identifies as male. “That identity is important,” she says. “When that’s rejected, kids and adults have higher risks for suicide , substance abuse, depression, and anxiety.” \"The dynamic playing out in Texas is forcing Mack to choose between two undesirable choices: He either gives up the sport he loves, or he is forced to wrestle against girls,\" Hudson Taylor, executive director of Athlete Ally , a nonprofit dedicated to eradicating homophobia and transphobia through sports, tells SELF. \"The only way to ensure that every athlete has equal access to sport and an equitable experience is to allow transgender athletes to compete with the gender with which they identify.\" It's “not right” that Beggs is forced to wrestle against girls, Forcier says. “If he identifies as male...it’s not medically recommended or psychiatrically recommended that he would be forced to wrestle with girls,” she says. “It’s a harmful thing that is being done.” Sarah McBride, national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, tells SELF that the rules put in place by the UIL are “horrible.” “Mack is a boy, and Mack should be allowed to play sports and participate in daily life just like any other boy,” she says. “Allowing transgender people to compete with teams consistent with their gender identity creates a level playing field for everyone—it doesn’t create an advantage for anyone.” Alex Keuroghlian, M.D., M.P.H., a clinical fellow in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital who works with transgender patients, tells SELF that forcing Beggs to compete against girls is “just as inappropriate” as making other boys wrestle against girls. Whether Beggs has a physical advantage over the girls he's being forced to compete against isn't the point. It depends on his baseline strength, how he’s responding to his testosterone therapy, and the strength of the girls he’s wrestling, Keuroghlian says. But, he adds, the psychological dynamic is more relevant. “Wrestling with girls probably makes him uncomfortable and makes them uncomfortable as well,” he says. Keuroghlian adds that transgender people are often “misgendered,” i.e., forced into roles based on their sex assigned at birth rather than the gender with which they identify, and it’s shaming. “It can be traumatic and has lasting adverse psychological consequences.” While some states have more transgender-inclusive student-athlete policies than Texas, Taylor says that there's more work to be done. \"Everybody deserves to have equal access, opportunity and experience in sports, and Mack's story shows us that we're falling short of that goal,\" he says. \"Now is the time for schools and leagues across the country to adopt policies that are inclusive of transgender student-athletes, and promote the values of equality, inclusion, and respect that the athletic community holds so close.\" Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:31:54.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
