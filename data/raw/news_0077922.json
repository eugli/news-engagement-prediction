Here’s what to expect from The Voice UK’s battle rounds \nThe 41-year-old Voice UK judge caused a stir on last night’s show (February 25), after offering contestant Charlie Drew his email address after losing out to Dannii Barnes in the battle rounds. \nFollowing the round, Charlie begged the judges for a steal, saying: ‘I just don’t feel like I’m ready to go. I think I’ve got a lot more to provide.’ To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nSir Tom Jones agreed, saying: ‘I think that somebody should definitely steal you, honestly.’ \nAfter the red lights of rejection beamed in the studio however, will.i.am approached Charlie and said: ‘Here’s my email. Let’s connect.’ \nPotential record contract? Guest vocalist appearance? Running low on party guests? Who knows. Will.i.am has been covering his face during tense ‘steal’ segments (Picture: ITV) \nFollowing the exchange, he added: ‘What I like about Charlie from the blinds is that his voice was flawless. I just had my eye out on a certain person, and each one of us has only one person to steal.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:55:56.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
