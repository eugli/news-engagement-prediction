I also let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda, but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that.”\nA boycott against Uber gained steam last weekend after the ride-hailing company tweeted that it had suspended surge pricing during a strike by cab drivers at New York’s JFK International Airport to protest Trump’s ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. Although Uber tweeted that it didn’t intend to break the strike, that incident, in combination with Kalanick’s presence on the council, stirred fury on social media.\nKalanick said on Facebook that he planned to speak up against the ban at the economic advisory group’s first meeting on Friday. Uber also pledged $3 million to a nonprofit Driver Legal Defense Fund to provide lawyers for affected drivers, and offered to compensate drivers stranded in the affected countries during the three-month ban.\nALSO Lyft rides a wave of anger to the top of the App Store How tech companies responded to Trump’s immigration ban Uber teams with Daimler on autonomous cars Nineteen business leaders and others are on the economic advisory council, including the heads of Disney, Tesla, General Motors and Pepsi and Walmart.\nCarolyn Said is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
