Gorsuch should not be the first.” \nPence went on to say that he and Trump have “full confidence” that Gorsuch will be confirmed, while explaining that the Trump administration will ensure that Gorsuch receives an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor “one way or the other,” alluding to the nuclear option. \nGorsuch’s record is undeniably impeccable, which is what scares the left. \nHe’s conservative. He’s a traditionalist. He’s a textualist. He’s an originalist. \nBasically, he’s a proud American who doesn’t believe the constitution is a living, breathing document. \nThe nerve of the guy!
