Millennials £2,700,000,000,000 worse off because of previous generation’s decisions \nThey had been eating in the restaurant with a family member at around at lunchtime on February 9, when they were approached by the woman, Kristeen said. \n‘I noticed this woman just lingering around us, and as I kissed my girlfriend on the cheek she came over and told us it wasn’t appropriate, and implied for us to leave,’ she said.

You see a lot worse in McDonald’s, there was nothing inappropriate about us kissing on the cheek.’ \nToddler unconscious for 40 minutes after dysentery outbreak hits UK Sixth form student Kristeen, from Farnworth says they felt pressured to walk out of the restaurant in Bolton town centre. \n‘When I rang the management to complain they said if it happens again they will talk to her, but it’s not good enough,’ she said. ‘We are not going to come back. \n‘We have had people say things to us in the past but we have never had someone approach us and kick us out before. \n‘It made us feel awful, we were walking out and we didn’t know what to do, so we just started crying. That’s all we felt we could do.’ McDonald’s has apologised (Picture: Rex) \nThe girls, who have been going out for almost a year, both attend Bolton Sixth Form College, and were regular diners at the restaurant before the alleged incident. \nKristeen added: ‘They rang us a couple of days ago saying that they would be in touch with the cleaner to talk to her, but we were still discriminated against, we don’t feel that’s enough. We want an apology.’ \nMcDonald’s spokesman said: ‘We are extremely sorry for Ms Ferenczi and her partners’ experience and have taken this complaint very seriously. \n‘An internal investigation is currently underway and we would like to make it clear that discrimination of this nature is wholly unacceptable and not, in any way, tolerated by McDonald’s.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:39:44.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
