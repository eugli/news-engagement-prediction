According to Chris Christie , that is.\nThe New Jersey governor and former Republican presidential candidate , along with his wife, Mary Pat, visited the White House on Tuesday to have dinner with Trump. Christie spoke about the event while guest-hosting a New York sports talk radio show and says that when the diners opened their menus, Trump told everyone to have whatever they’d like to eat — except Christie himself.\nInstead, Trump insisted that both he and Christie would have the meatloaf.\n“This is what it’s like to be with Trump,” Christie said. “He says, ‘There’s the menu, you guys order whatever you want.’ And then he says, ‘Chris, you and I are going to have the meatloaf.’ “\nRELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack\nChristie adds that Trump told him: “I’m telling you, the meatloaf is fabulous.”\nAt the dinner, he and Trump also discussed the country’s ongoing opiod epidemic, according to the governor. The next day, Christie signed multiple bills aimed at combating the crisis. The pair did not, Christie said, discuss any potential jobs in Trump’s administration .\nChristie famously endorsed Trump early on in the presidential race, in February 2016, just after suspending his own campaign for the presidency.\nRelated:", "external_links": ["https://secure.hulu.com/embed.html?eid=2fRpAW65PH2ZvD3hWfJQxw&partner=yahoo"], "published": "2017-02-18T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:59:41.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
