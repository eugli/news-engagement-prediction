It's difficult for the opponent to come here and win games,\" Hazard said in the London Evening Standard.\nHazard believes Chelsea have the fear factor at the Bridge (Photo: Clive Mason) The Belgian says some teams are beaten BEFORE the match kicks off (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \"Do I get that feeling that some teams are beaten before kick-off? Yes. We are playing better than last season.\n\"It's a little like two years ago when we won the league.\n\"I remember the second part of the season back then - sometimes the team didn't play well, but we always scored at least one goal and Thibaut Courtois would make at least one good save, like against Arsenal.\n\"We are in full confidence here on this pitch. You know the fans bring everything, they support us.\n\"I remember against Tottenham [the 2-1 win] earlier in the season when they scored, but the supporters kept going, they kept singing.\n\"It's great and we feel very good on this pitch. We know everything can happen in football, but we have self-belief and that is very important in football.\"\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch Next Manager gets on the pitch and tackles player in M Watch this video again Watch Next Everton Luiz leaves pitch in tears after racist c 2:37 FIFA Youtuber makes players giant 0:21 Genoa fans block in team bus in protest after hum 1:38 Watch: Pep Guardiola reacts after Manchester City 11:07 Pep Guardiola reacts after Manchester City beat M 2:03 An excited Marcelo reacts to Cristiano Ronaldo's 0:32 Anthony Martial speaks ahead of Manchester United 2:53 James Pearce discusses Liverpool's future in Kirk 2:58 Teddy Sheringham reveals how close Diego Maradona 1:15 Video will play in  Chelsea players scoring brilliant goals in training Share this video Watch Next Read More Chelsea stars Willian and Kurt Zouma stun teammates with devastating long-range goals in training Hazard called for Conte's squad to remain focused on delivering the required results from their remaining 13 league games.\nA potential league and FA Cup double could also be on the cards should Chelsea see off Manchester United in their quarter-final at Stamford Bridge next month.\n\"We just need to keep the same concentration. It's more difficult to play away because of the fans, but we are ready, we are professional. We can deal with the pressure. Everything is going good,\" Hazard said.\n\"We know if we want to be champions, in our home stadium we have to win most of our games.\n\"We can't say all 19 because we have already lost to Liverpool, but we have to win 16 to 17 because it is our place and we are ready to deliver.\"\npoll loading Will Chelsea win the Premier League? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Chelsea FC Newsletter Follow @mirrorfootball Subscribe to our Chelsea FC newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On Chelsea FC Eden Hazard", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:22:54.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
