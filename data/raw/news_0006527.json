One memorable instance took place the day before Christmas, 2009, when Democrats passed ObamaCare shortly after 7 am on a party-line vote of 60 to 39.\nWhile two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), will ultimately oppose DeVos, they will vote with their GOP colleagues on the procedural question of ending dilatory debate.\nSenate rules require that 30 hours elapse after the Senate has voted to cut off a filibuster before a vote on final passage can be held.\nBy voting at 6:30 a.m., Republicans have a chance of confirming DeVos by late Monday but if Democrats drag out the post-cloture debate for the full 30 hours, it could lag intoTuesday.\nMcConnell and other GOP leaders are confident that there will be no other Republican defections on DeVos. They expect she will win confirmation next week with 51 votes after Vice President Pence weighs in to break an expected tie.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.thehill.com/"], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:38:01.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
