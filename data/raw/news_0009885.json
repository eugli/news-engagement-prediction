She died hours before she was due to fly home. \nShe was married to a professor at Florida State University who had been teaching summer classes in London. \nThe three men injured in the attack were a Briton, an American and an Australian. Two women, an Australian and Israeli, were also wounded. \nLocated in central London, Russell Square is close to both the British Museum and the University of London and has a number of popular tourist hotels.
