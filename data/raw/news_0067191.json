Red Huber/TNS/Getty Images \nSpaceX has aborted a rendezvous with the International Space Station at the last minute. An unmanned supply ship was less than a mile from the ISS when a GPS error forced the decision to delay the docking until Thursday. \nElon Musk 's private space travel company SpaceX has a contract to deliver food and equipment to the ISS. The latest run saw the Dragon vessel launched by a Falcon rocket from Florida on Sunday with 2,267 kilograms of supplies aboard. \nAnother supply ship is also due to arrive at the ISS on Friday. The Russian Progress 66 cargo ship launched today, marking the first successful launch since Progress 65 burned up in December while heading for orbit.
