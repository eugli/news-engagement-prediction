The brand was inspired by an environmental problem his business partner Ariel Brooker witnessed first-hand. The cans, which are filled with water from a spring in Austria, are now stocked in Selfridges and Whole Foods Celebrities such as Dougie Poynter, left, and supermodel David Gandy, right, are fans of the environmentally-friendly tipple Explaining the inspiration behind the brand's concept, Josh said: 'You might be reading at your desk, or on the train, sipping from a bottle of water – and I'm guessing the problem of plastic pollution is a million miles away from your thoughts. 'But catch a plane to Thailand, take a canoe to some of the country's small remote islands, and like Ariel, you'll see the impact eight million tonnes of plastic has on the ocean.' On his return to the UK, rather than accepting the status quo, Ariel, together with Josh and co-founder Perry Alexander Fielding, launched the UK's first-ever canned water product. The three founders each invested £3,000 up front and secured private investment, too. 'From idea, to concept, to store shelves in six months, the gamble has worked', he said. 'We never imagined the product would take off so quickly; two weeks ago we found ourselves on Sky News talking alongside Richard Branson and Prince Charles about environmental issues – it's just been crazy.' Sharing his advice for other entrepreneurs with a big idea and bold ambitions, Josh added: 'Just do it! There is no good time to quit your job, and no good time to start up a new business' Success, says Josh, comes down to good timing, a great concept, communication, and the guts to take a risk: 'It's like the gamble to sponsor London Fashion Week – a small business like us, supporting a huge event like that, has paid off.' He continued: 'Obviously it's still hard as a start-up, but the three of us are big believers in test and learn, in trying something different – seeing if it works, or learning if it fails. And making those judgement calls relies on constant collaboration and smooth, quick communication. ' MEET THE ENTREPRENEURS Josh, Ariel and Perry are three childhood friends from London, all under 25. With over a decade of experience in branding and graphic design, Perry decided to apply his skills to his new venture. With the vision of creating a product that has an impact visually as well as functionally for the environment, Perry teamed up with his good friends Ariel and Josh to help further develop the idea and launch CanO Water. Ariel has a background in the city where he was a headhunter scouting programmers and quant researchers for hedge funds and banks globally. After helping to bring the concept to life, he left his job to focus full time on CanO Water as he saw a gap in the market and was keen to educate people on the benefits of using aluminum vs plastic. Josh's background lies in the events and nightlife industry, with experience in marketing and having previously run a successful events company, Josh saw a perfect fit within the vision of CanO Water and his passion for the healthy lifestyle. L-R: With over a decade of experience in branding and graphic design, Perry decided to apply his skills to his new venture. Ariel has a background in the city where he was a headhunter. Josh's background lies in the events and nightlife industry, with experience in marketing Having been successful in their mission to 'crack' the UK drinks market, the founders now have their eyes set on the US, and believe the Oscars is an opportunity to hit the states with a bang. 'The US is a massive target for us – especially now that cities such as San Francisco have banned the sale of all plastic bottles under one litre.' The brand already has celebrity support from Ellie Goulding, David Gandy and Dougie from McFly, as well as a number of other celebrities sharing their passion to fight for change. Josh concluded: 'We don't just see CanO Water as a product on the shelves, it could change everything. By 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish – and we're aiming to change that. We take risks because we want to build a brand, that can help us be a part of something better.' Sharing his advice for other entrepreneurs with a big idea and bold ambitions, Josh added: 'Just do it! There is no good time to quit your job, and no good time to start up a new business. 'You could find a million hurdles, a million reasons not to do it, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try.'
