BMW Group \n“BMW Motorrad approached LEGO Group with the idea of a collaboration,” according to Heiner Faust, head of BMW Motorrad sales and marketing. \nTogether, the design teams created the LEGO Technic Hover Ride—an alternative model included in the 2-in-1 kit. \n“We set the BMW Motorrad and LEGO Technic design teams a challenge … that has resulted in this amazing bike,” Any Woodman, senior design manager for LEGO Technic, said in a statement . “Collaboration between our two teams was driven by passion and respect for the DNA of each other’s brands.” BMW Group \nBut the scaled-down scooter, as cool as it looks on display, wasn’t enough for BMW, which tapped its Munich-based training unit, BMW Junior Company, to build a life-size model of the LEGO Technic Hover Ride. \nTrainees in the second to fourth year of their course used the serial-production parts of the BMW R 1200 GS Adventure, as well as their own design savvy, to create a design concept—presented last week at LEGO World in Copenhagen. \nThe in-real-life Hover Ride replica has traveled to different locations in Denmark, on its way to the BMW Group Research and Innovation Center Munich and BMW Welt exhibition center in Germany. \nBMW and LEGO’s prototype is unlikely to hit the road any time soon (if ever). In the meantime, Russian drone maker Hoversurf Inc. unveiled its own electric-powered hoverbike, the Scorpion-3 (video above). \nThe single-seat aircraft is “the next step in accessible amateur flying developed to inspire athletes, engineers, scientists, and innovators around the world,” according to the company website .
