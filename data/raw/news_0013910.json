The security regulator found that for 7-8 months, all IndiGo cabin crew members had been securing 96-98% in the aviation security exams conducted in-house. The licence of IndiGo's Gurgaon-based ASTC was suspended on Friday after an inspection by BCAS officials in Januaryend . \"They were making a mockery of exams,\" said BCAS chief Kumar Rajesh Chandra. \"For now, the airline will have to stop security training it imparts at its centre till corrective measures are put in place.\" The issue began when about eight months ago, Indi-Go changed the exam format for cabin crew security training from online exams to penand-paper without informing the security regulator. \"Our suspicions were aroused when we found that IndiGo cabin crew members consistently scored high,\" said Chandra. The inspection revealed: the question paper for cabin crew security exam hadn't changed for eight months. Even the sequence of questions in the multiple-choice paper was the same as was that of answer choices. \"We found that IndiGo flight attendants were just mugging up the question numbers with the relevant answer choices,\" the official said. An IndiGo spokesperson said, \"We are confident of demonstrating sufficient compliance to the satisfaction of the BCAS. We would like to clarify that this discussion only pertains to aviation security training. All other trainings are continuing, as scheduled, and there has been no change in our operations.\" The training academy is run by IndiGo's parent company InterGlobe Aviation. Given that the minimum marks required to pass these exams is 80%, a number of candidates would have failed had the airline conducted the exams in a fair manner, said an aviation source. After they are recruited, flight attendants undergo extensive training, which includes a six-day security course. IndiGo has been on a fleet-expansion spree in recent years and so needs a steady supply of pilots and cabin crew each month.
