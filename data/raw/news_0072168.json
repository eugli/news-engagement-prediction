(Sorry readers but, to be fair, you clicked.)\nSupermodel and St. Joseph native Kate Upton, fresh off her third Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover appearance , stopped by Bravo's \"What What Happens Live\" on Wednesday night and took some questions from callers.\nOne caller asked if her fiancé, Detroit Tigers right-handed pitcher Justin Verlander, has rules about sex before or after games because, as you know, baseball players can be very superstitious people.\nRead more:\n'Damn, J.V.:' Cabrera and Verlander face off in batting practice\nThat's three! Kate Upton returns to Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover\nMaybe most people would prefer to keep such information private, but Upton seemed happy to spill the answer on this one.\n“There’s no sex before a game,\" she confirmed. \"Absolutely none. And then, also what I just found out is, if he plays too well, there’s no sex after, either. He’s exhausted.\n\"Kind of a buzzkill for me,\" she added, laughing.\nWatch the clip here .\nUpton also addressed her angry tweet from November , after Verlander missed out on winning his second American League Cy Young Award, in which Quote: : \"Hey @MLB I thought I was the only person allowed to f*** @JustinVerlander ?! What 2 writers didn't have him on their ballot?\"\nApparently, Verlander - who lost to ex-teammate Rick Porcello in large part because two Tampa writers left him off their ballots entirely - wasn't mad about the tweet.\n“I think his first reaction was a little bit surprised that I had already sent it, but overall he loved it,\" Upton said Wednesday.\nSpeaking of Verlander, the Tigers are in Lakeland for spring training, opening up exhibition play against Florida Southern.\nContact Brian Manzullo: bmanzullo@freepress.com.
