If Wenger's troops are to get a result, they will have to be on their game from the off. \nDefensively, no mistakes can be made and Ospina will have to be wary from set pieces with the likes of Robert Lewandowski and Mats Hummels likely to pray on his smaller stature. \nAs for the Gunners, the debate surrounding Mesut Ozil's place in the team continues but surely Wenger will not surrender his primary creative instrument in a game of this magnitude? If he and Alexis Sanchez find their form, a positive result could be on the cards. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
