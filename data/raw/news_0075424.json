As the live telecast wrapped amid a ton of chaos at the Dolby Theatre, the self-depreciating late night host tried to lighten things up by saying: “I knew I would screw this show up.

After the movie La La Land was announced as this year’s Academy Award winner for best picture, it was revealed that Moonlight actually won. La La Land producer Fred Berger was in the middle of delivering his acceptance speech when he was interrupted by staffers from PricewaterhouseCoopers and told that his film didn’t win after all. Kimmel stood by as the correct card was shown to the stunned audience. \nPresenter Warren Beatty, who had announced the incorrect winner alongside Faye Dunaway, apologized, saying he was given the wrong envelope. Beatty and Dunaway reportedly were handed the best actress envelope which listed La La Land star Emma Stone as the winner of best actress, instead of the best picture envelope.

I would like to see you get an Oscar anyway, why can’t we just give out a whole bunch of them?” \nAfter the Moonlight cast took the stage to celebrate their win, Kimmel tried to calm down the shocked crowd, and he promised never to return as the host of Hollywood’s biggest night. \n“Well I don’t know what happened,” Jimmy said. \n“I blame myself for this. Let’s remember, it’s just an awards show. I mean, we hate to see people disappointed, but the good news is we got to see some extra speeches,” he asserted. “We have some great movies. I knew I would screw this show up, I really did. Thank you for watching. I’m back to work tomorrow night on my regular show. I promise I’ll never come back. Good night!” \nAccording to People , Jimmy Kimmel said he knows he will forever be asked about the movie night mix-up. \n“I don’t know what just happened!” Kimmel said. “I should probably find out … for the rest of my life people are going to ask me about this.” \nThe Jimmy Kimmel Live Twitter account posted a few tweets following the Oscar oops. \"It's like a horror movie, gluten is literally falling from the sky.\" – Jimmy Kimmel #Oscars ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:24:29.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
