Justice Secretary Liz Truss wants prisons to turn inmates' lives around Credit: PA \nThe Bill brings together a number of reforms announced in recent months as prisons were hit by surging levels of violence, suicides and a spate of major disturbances. \nJustice Secretary Elizabeth Truss said: \"Prison is about punishing people who have committed heinous crimes, but it should be a place where offenders are given the opportunity to turn their lives around. \n\"I want our prisons to be places of discipline, hard work and self-improvement, where staff are empowered to get people off drugs, improve their English and maths get a job on release.\" \nOther measures in the Bill include: Powers for courts to put an end to domestic violence victims being quizzed by their attackers in family courts Fixed tariffs capping whiplash compensation payouts An extension of \"virtual\" court hearings, allowing victims to take part without running the risk of coming face-to-face with their assailant A new system allowing those charged with less serious criminal offences -such as failure to produce a ticket for travel on a train - to plead guilty, accept a penalty and pay it online  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:29:56.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
