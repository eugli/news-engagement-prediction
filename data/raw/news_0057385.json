It was rescued 15 years later by an enthusiast for £7,500. \nAfter several more changes of ownership it has finally been brought back to life. The 76804 steam engine, dubbed the Lancashire Lazarus, spent years on train 'death row' \nMelvin Thorley, a train enthusiast from Offerton , will be among those watching its resurrection and will ‘chase’ the train along its route. \nThe 69-year-old said: “Train enthusiasts will be amazed to see it again. It is from another era and, in the nicest possible way, a dinosaur.” Read More Victoria station roof collapse WAS caused by seagulls - and hub bosses blundered by not repairing it sooner \nMr Thorley said: “It was a wreck so it is astounding that it has been restored. It cost so much for the current owners as it was such a large project. It was just a steel shell. \n“This was the last train of its type to come out of service which meant when it came to be scrapped it slipped through the net. It was fate. \n“It was basically on ‘death row’ but steel prices had fallen and by the time they got round to scrapping it, the train had nostalgia value and was sold.” The 76804 steam engine will travel from Bury to Buxton via Stockport. \nThe 100-tonne engine, which is 18m long, will leave Bury at 8.52am and cross Belmont Bridge before stopping at Stockport station from 9.21am to 9.31am. \nIt will also pass through Davenport at 9.35am, Hazel Grove at 9.40am and New Mills , Marsh Lane, at 9.49am, before reaching Buxton.

They were built in the 1950s but taken out of service as diesel engines made them obsolete within a decade. \nThe train will eventually have a permanent new home on the North Norfolk Railway.
