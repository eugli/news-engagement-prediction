Any half-competent prosecutor might call that claiming public money under false pretences. Maybe Baroness D’Souza — who is no slouch at expenses herself, and once ran up a £230 bill for a chauffeur-driven car waiting outside Covent Garden for four hours while she went to the opera — should give the cheat’s name to the Metropolitan Police. Several Members were exposed as cheats during the expenses scandals six years ago, two being sent to prison and others suspended. Has behaviour not improved since then? By the way, the suspended peers have crept back. This week, I saw one of them, Baroness Uddin — she had to repay £125,000 in expenses after claiming for a home she did not live in — striding into the Chamber without a shadow of shame on her face. The documentary offers viewers a glimpse into the Lords Chamber Lord Palmer speaks out during the programme that has given a glimpse into the pampered world of the House of Lords ‘There is a core of peers who work incredibly hard,’ Lady D’Souza told the BBC, ‘and there are, sad to say, many, many, many peers who contribute absolutely nothing but who claim the full allowance.’ Not just ‘many’, please note. That was ‘many, many, many’. Yet they all have a vote in the Lords, and so will have several opportunities in the coming months to block the majority referendum wish of more than 17 million voters who opted for Brexit. Lord Prescott, former Deputy Prime Minister, has never been terribly comfortable down at the red-carpeted end of Parliament. Good for him. In the BBC film he can be seen describing noble Members tottering in for a subsidised dinner, a stiff drink, possibly a glance at the newspaper and the opportunity to telephone friends and tell them ostentatiously: ‘I’m ringing from the House of Lords.’ Lord Prescott has trouble keeping the contempt from his voice. He even seems to be mimicking their posh accents. The programme repeatedly calls the House of Lords ‘a club’, as though it were some sort of congenial watering hole for gentlemen and ladies of leisure. Lib Dem peer Lord Tyler offers the BBC a different analogy: ‘It’s the best day-care centre for the elderly in London. Families can drop in on him or her and make sure that the staff will look after him very well — and he can have a snooze in the afternoon in the Chamber or in the library.’ Meanwhile, convivial crossbencher Lord Palmer said that a chum of his could always be found sinking gin and tonics in the bar well before midday, before moving on to a bucket of red and his lunchtime solids. Redcoat Jason Bean pictured outside the House of Lords. A Lords spokesman insisted the documentary showed how it was doing its work as ‘an active and effective revising chamber’ Meet The Lords, which begins next Monday, shows elderly peers snoozing on the red benches during a debate and drinking wine at the ‘long table’ of their taxpayer-subsidised restaurant Lord Palmer was appalled that the television room, where certain peers had enjoyed spending long afternoons watching the tennis from Wimbledon, had been turned — brace yourself, Marjorie — into offices. ‘It’s really rather extraordinary,’ he said, plainly baffled by this development. I know and like Lord Palmer, but I fear that viewers may find him a less than entirely democratic figure at a time of almost fit-to-explode tensions between a pro-EU Commons and the pro-Brexit voters. It is not as if the BBC set out to attack the Lords. Far from it. The tone of the programme veers between the playful and the respectful. It has one of those pizzicato soundtracks that documentary-makers use when they are trying to keep things light. There is something almost ludicrous as a succession of stick-clutching, wobbly nonagenarians is seen arriving for the day’s excitements. ‘They look a lot more frail than they actually are,’ says ‘Red Coat’ doorkeeper Jim Bean. He is right. They look doddery but they wield a lot of (i.e. far too much) power. As you might expect from the Beeb, there is a subtly anti-Tory message as the programme follows Left-wing peers who are opposing a housing policy pursued by the rotten Tory government (the film was made when David Cameron was still in office). The show bigs up Labour’s Baroness (Oona) King and crossbencher Lord (John) Bird, founder of the Big Issue magazine. The film keeps firmly in the background such unsavoury characters as Lord Temple-Morris, a virulently pro-EU sometime Tory MP made a peer in the Blair years after he defected to Labour (one of several Europhile Tory defectors to be ennobled). Yeoman Usher Brigadier Neil Baverstock (left) and Black Rod David Leakey (right) We catch glimpses in the film of Baroness (Karren) Brady, the former protegee of pornographer David Sullivan, who was so controversially given ermine by the Cameroons. In the background shots we see the likes of the Kinnocks, Lib Dem spin doctor Olly Grender, ex-Labour MP Paul Boateng, and a laughable Labour plodder called Dave Watts who in all my years of watching the Commons I never heard say a single interesting word (which isn’t to say he didn’t like to offer his opinion on the floor of the House). All these people are now in the Chamber where our laws can be made and our liberty to leave the European Union can be blocked. Tory elder statesman Lord Tebbit observes that Mrs Thatcher would never have ennobled her husband Denis’s tailor, but that, pretty much, was the calibre of some of the people now being sent to the Lords. At least a tailor would have a proper skill. That’s more than you can say about the dismal Dave Watts. Will the two remaining programmes in the series catch something of the modern-Establishment inertia of today’s Lords: the vast numbers of lawyers and lobbyists and former MEPs and European Commission employees who now sit on the Upper House’s benches? They were in action yesterday in the Chamber, Labour’s Baroness (Helena) Kennedy of The Shaws boasting angrily that she and her colleagues brought ‘expertise from so many walks of life’. Meanwhile, Labour’s Lord Liddle, sometime amanuensis to Lord Mandelson, almost sobbed as he clutched his head and — passions surging — declared his intention to fight Brexit for as long as he lived. Here, voters of Britain, are your lords and lawmakers. Lunchtime trougher Lord Walpole may have been speaking half in jest when he said ‘this is where the country is governed from’, but some of them really do think they run our lives. And until the Lords is reformed, reduced or even abolished, they will go on thinking that. Meet The Lords is on BBC2 on Monday at 9pm.
