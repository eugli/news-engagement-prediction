In almost 65 districts CPI has its organisational units but they are struggling because of dearth of resources. The same is the condition of other leftist parties,\" Anjaan told PTI in an interview.\nNotwithstanding the reverses suffered in the last two elections, all the Left parties, including CPI, CPM, Revolutionary Socialist Party and Forward Bloc, have together fielded candidates on 140 seats of the total 403 Assembly constituencies in UP this time.\nFormer member of CPM central committee SP Kashyap said Left parties have lagged behind due to polarisation on caste and communal lines as these two factors are strongly associated with people's emotions.\n\"There is cultural backwardness and understanding of political ideology and those who have vested interest in polarisation have massive resources ... in this context the fight of Left parties gets weakened on its own,\" Kashyap pointed out.\nAnjaan is, however, hopeful that Left movement will go on in the state as those indulging in caste and religion based politics have gradually got exposed.\n\"This process of getting exposed is today passing through its final stage ... the youth today does not get carried away by communally inflammatory speeches but ask for report card,\" Anjaan added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:29:30.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
