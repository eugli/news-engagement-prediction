(Photo: Mike Coppola, Getty Images) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nDavid Beckham became one of the world’s most famous sports figures thanks to a combination of looks, talent, circumstance, marriage — and the accompanying glut of media attention that those things brought. \nOver the past week, however, the English soccer icon’s popularity has taken a monumental hit, following the release of a damning collection of alleged personal emails between him and his longtime public relations assistant. \nBeckham, 41, retired in 2013 yet has remained in the spotlight, modeling for fashion companies, endorsing high-end products around the world, dabbling in the acquisition of a Major League Soccer franchise in Miami and plowing his time into charitable causes with UNICEF. \nIt all kept him relevant and beloved, especially in his homeland. Brits saw him as a stand-up guy and seemingly the perfect antithesis of the spoiled, money-hungry soccer player. \nMORE SOCCER COVERAGE: Spanish clubs spend only 18M euros in transfer window \nUntil last week. \nThat was when Football Leaks, soccer’s version of the secret-spilling WikiLeaks, released a series of emails allegedly involving Beckham, many exchanged between the star and his PR man and friend Simon Oliveira. \nThey were not flattering. The messages included a rant in which Beckham complained of being snubbed in Britain’s New Year’s Honours list instead of being “knighted” and given the title “Sir David.” \nIn another alleged email from Beckham, he asks UNICEF to pay him more than $7,000 for a business class flight to a charity event in Asia, even though he was already catching a ride with one of his sponsors. \nAmong other details in the emails in question, it is suggested that Beckham publicly backed the “Remain” campaign in last year’s Brexit vote that saw the United Kingdom split with the European Union, in order to curry favor with the establishment. \nA further claim that Oliveira asked popular British chat show host Jonathan Ross to raise the prospect of Beckham being knighted during Beckham’s appearance on Ross’ program. “David is up for it,” Oliveira is said to have written. \nAttempting to sway the honors committee, which works on behalf of the Queen, is highly frowned upon in Britain and the whole saga has left both the public and some of Beckham’s millions of fans around the world wondering what to think. \nNo brand as powerful as his is built and cultivated without hard work, yet there always seemed to be a natural ease about Beckham, a genuine feel about his working-class upbringing before his talent brought him soccer fame and a marriage to former Spice Girl Victoria “Posh Spice” Adams. \nPerhaps the most telling part has been the response, which is either a master class in crisis management or a dirty second chapter to a sorry scenario. Immediately Beckham’s publicity machine has whirred into action. \nMitigating stories have begun to spring up in the English news media. The emails had been doctored, it is claimed, though no details have been provided. Oliveira did not respond to requests for comment from USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday. \nThere was a blackmail plot against Oliveira’s company, several other stories have claimed. The emails, apparently, were taken out of context. He didn’t even care if he got a knighthood, reported another publication. UNICEF put out a press release defending him. And so on. \nIt is a typical approach. Respond quickly and loudly and, in some cases, with threats of legal action against your accuser. It is intended to have the effect of muddying the waters, throwing enough doubts on the accusations that people don’t know what to believe. Alternative facts, if you like. Or, if not, then certainly an alternative narrative. \nIn Beckham’s case, it is not a new thing. The former midfielder is pleasant company and an engaging man, with an agreeable personality and an underrated sense of humor. \nBut whether through his design or that of others, significant parts of his life and career have been cloaked in spin. Back when he signed for the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007, a move that was supposed to revolutionize American soccer, a press release was concocted claiming the deal was worth $250 million over five years. The biggest contract in soccer history! \nExcept that it wasn’t. MLS and Galaxy officials later said the trumped-up figure was insisted upon by Beckham’s then-management company. His salary, over five years, was actually a touch over $30 million, with some add-ons included. \nHowever, the $250 million figure stuck, and still often gets quoted in reference to his time in America. \nWhen Beckham engineered a temporary loan to Italian club AC Milan in 2008, it incited the frustration of Galaxy fans who had barely seen him in any meaningful action due to injuries. At the time, Oliveira angrily called up reporters who dared to suggest the move was in poor taste given that he had produced so little for L.A. \nPeople are a whole lot more skeptical now. It is a new time for Beckham and the old rules might not work anymore. The days of his every move being taken at face value are over. Now every social media message, even those with his children over the past few years, will be scrutinized to see if it is part of some hidden agenda. \nThe PR effort aimed at remedying the email situation has caused some confusion but hasn’t repaired Beckham’s reputation, just created more doubt. \nThere is only one thing that everyone seems to agree on coming out of this. Whether he wants one or not, Beckham won’t be getting a knighthood now. Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Arsenal's Mesut Ozil tries a volley against Chelsea.
