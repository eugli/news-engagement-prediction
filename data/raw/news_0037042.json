The document added: 'Touch deprivation/touch taboo rules are likely to be harmful to the psychological wellbeing of children and young people in general.' Child psychologist Sean Cameron, who led the conference discussion, said: 'What's missing is a recognition of how important touch is. And that withholding touch is, in itself, a form of psychological abuse.' He argued it is not enough for children just to be touched by their parents at home, as human emotion cannot be compartmentalised. Experts argue that rigidly adhering to these rules when pupils are happy, distressed or worried could cause more harm Dr Cameron said: 'It's to do with context, isn't it? There are just some occasions when, as a human being, you need to touch another person. Just to show shared delight or horror or sorrow. These things happen in school as well as at home.' Professor Francis McGlone, head of affective neuroscience at Liverpool John Moores University, said touch is vital for children's neurological development. He said: 'Touch isn't just good – it's absolutely essential. Denying it is like denying a child oxygen. I get very exercised about the demonisation of touch. It's cruel, in my mind. It's another form of abuse.' He added: 'Babies that aren't touched – it has a deleterious effect. They tend to have high levels of stress and aggression as adults.' Heather Piper, emeritus professor of education at Manchester Metropolitan University, said she wanted society to move away from the panic surrounding child abuse. However, she understood teachers' caution over touching pupils. She added: 'Most people are fearful of what others will think of them. They're fearful of the consequence of an allegation. We live in a society where people say, \"There's no smoke without fire\".' Mary Bousted, general secretary of the ATL teaching union, said her union acknowledged that a humane relationship with pupils involved occasional physical contact. But she would always advise teachers to be cautious. 'Don't put yourself in a dangerous position,' she said. 'Don't put yourself in a situation where a child can accuse you of inappropriate contact. 'Of course, children must be protected. But teachers also have a right not to have their career ruined by false accusations.' Physical contact between teachers and pupils is not currently illegal. Government guidelines state that there are occasions 'when physical contact... with a pupil is proper and necessary'. But in practice, many schools, either explicitly or implicitly, discourage teachers from touching pupils. Malcolm Arnold Academy in Northampton sparked outcry last September after it introduced no-touch guidelines. The policy discourages physical contact between pupils, as well as between pupils and teachers.
