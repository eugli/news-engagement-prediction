It has already been declared as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US in June 2014. \nIndia reacted cautiously to the reports of detention of Mumbai attack mastermind and Saeed and four others under an anti-terrorism act by Pakistan. \nAlso Read - Donald Trump effect? 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed detained in Lahore \n\"We have also noted that Hafiz Saeed and four others have been placed under preventive detention. Exercises such as yesterday's orders against Hafiz Saeed and others have been carried out by Pakistan in the past also. Only a credible crack down on the mastermind of the Mumbai terrorist attack and terrorist organisations involved in cross border terrorism would be proof of Pakistan's sincerity,\" External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Vikas Swarup said.
