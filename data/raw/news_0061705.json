What do participants have to do? \nThe research involves people participating in a quick walking and balance test that is filmed and repeated three times over the course of nine months. \nThe time gap means any changes in gait can be detected. \n\"I am currently combining the two methods, a traditional force-plate and the videos to compare the data and see the correlations that can be drawn to establish a ground truth,\" Ms Ismail said.

(ABC News: Alkira Reinfrank) \n\"The research looks at the movement of participants' legs, but also at how their torso moves or sways as they walk. \n\"I'm hoping that by comparing the data, we can spot changes in the video that relate to what the force-plate is detecting. Then we can begin to program computers to analyse these videos looking for similar changes.\" \nIf the data recorded from the videos correlates with the data from the traditional force-plate method, work can begin producing a low-cost and portable technology to track gait. \nStudy supervisor Roland Goecke hoped an app or computer program could be developed within the next three years. \n\"This is a really fascinating point in time now, where technology has become so ubiquitous and so cheap that we can really use it in everyday life,\" he said. \n\"This is a fascinating crossover between health care and technology.\" \nIf you would like to be involved in the study email Ms Ismail at Hafsa.Ismail@canberra.edu.au ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:20:03.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
