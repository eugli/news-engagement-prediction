Having first hit the top 10 with “Pon De Replay” on the July 16, 2005-dated chart, she needed 10 years, seven months and two weeks to tally 30 top 10s. Only The Beatles hit the landmark more quickly, from “I Want to Hold Your Hand” to “Something,” over a span of just five years, nine months and two weeks (Jan. 25, 1964-Nov. 8, 1969).
