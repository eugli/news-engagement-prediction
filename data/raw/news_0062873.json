The poster, which ties in with the Thursday afternoon 40th anniversary panel at the four-day event, features the main characters in each of the trilogies of what's become known as \"the Skywalker Saga\" portion of the franchise to date, with a particular focus on the  Force Awakens cast.\nIndeed, The Force Awakens provides seven characters on the poster — more, if you factor in those who appeared in earlier movies — as compared with just three characters from the prequel era (Anakin Skywalker, Padmé Amidala and the young Obi-Wan Kenobi) and eight characters from the original trilogy (Darth Vader, Yoda, Chewbacca, Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, C-3PO and R2-D2). A sign of where the focus of the series lies for now, perhaps …?\n( Rogue One is entirely absent from the poster, unless you count a Death Star appearance. Similarly, there are no sneak peeks at the cast from the just-started-shooting Han Solo stand-alone to be found, either.)\nStar Wars Celebration runs April 13-17 at the Orange County Convention Center.\nRead more: Disney Unveils First-Look at Han Solo Movie in Cast Photo", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:35:40.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
