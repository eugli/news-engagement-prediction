Read More My £180 botched lip job left me with two 'raw sausages' so disgusting that they made my mum vomit \nAnd Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk has called on the government to close up ‘timewasting loopholes’ in immigration law. \nPaedophile Shabir Ahmed, who led the child sex grooming ring, had previously tried and failed to overturn his convictions at a European court, arguing he was not given a fair trial by because all the members of the jury were white. But the claim was thrown out last year. \nAhmed, 63, and three others from the gang - Adil Khan, Abdul Rauf and Abdul Aziz - are now appealing against a decision by then Home Secretary, Theresa May, to strip them of British citizenship. Abdul Rauf was released on licence in 2015, and is now appealing against a Home Office order to deport him \nMr Justice Bernard McCloskey, Britain’s most senior immigration judge, will deliver a decision later this month. Read More \nAhmed was described by a judge as a ‘violent hypocritical bully’ as he was jailed for 19 years in 2012. He was convicted of leading a group of Asian men who preyed on girls as young as 13. Simon Danczuk says the men should not be allowed to dodge deportation \nAhmed, who has dual UK and Pakistani citizenship, was jailed for a further 22 years, to run concurrently, for 30 child rapes after a separate trial. \nRauf, 47, was a religious studies teacher at a mosque in Rochdale after coming to the UK from Pakistan. \nHe was released on licence in 2015 after serving half of a six year sentence for trafficking a 15-year-old girl to the UK for sex - and for having sex with her himself. Shabir Ahmed was jailed for 22 years for repeatedly raping a girl over many years \nPakistan-born Aziz, 41, a taxi driver, was cleared of two counts of rape, but convicted of trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child. He was jailed for 18 years. \nKhan, 42, also a taxi driver, was caged for 18 years for trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child. He came to the UK from Pakistan in 1997. \nRochdale MP Mr Danczuk, who is calling for the men’s appeals to be denied, wants all them sent back to Pakistan. Read More \nHe said: “Shabir Ahmed and his accomplices are vile and dangerous individuals and I’m glad they’re off our streets. \n“But it is British taxpayers who are picking up the bill to keep them incarcerated. \n“The system is too open to abuse by criminals like these. It should be made easier for them to be deported. There shouldn’t be these loopholes to allow them to continue to languish in British prisons instead of ones in their home countries. \n“This case has gone on too long. The government must act.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T14:48:58.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
