Now, Lush's Donald Trump-inspired hair products are making waves. It's more of a product than a statement, a hair treatment inspired by the President. And like everything else produced by Lush , it's done with a glaring wink. Dubbed Yuge, after the way Trump says \"huge\", the treatment won't give you hair like the president—instead, it will do you one better. It's being billed as a volumizing hair mask composed of more than 10 percent sea salt. Enzymatic pineapple will cleanse your scalp, and a blend of jojoba oil, olive oil and honey will make your hair smooth and soft.

The product was unveiled at the Lush Summit 2017 in UK alongside an \"orange-faced, tiny-handed caricature,\" according to the brand. It was also announced shortly after the company's reaction to Trump's now-defunct travel ban, which temporarily prohibited residents of seven muslim majority countries from entering the United States. Lush responded to the travel ban by widening the company's statement to include: \"We believe that all people should enjoy freedom of movement across the world,\" which was displayed in the windows of each shop. Simon Allen/Lush \"Lush has always championed for inclusivity and acceptance in diversity (our Gay Is Ok and Refugees Welcome campaigns are only a few examples),\" a rep from the brand said in a statement. \"So it’s no surprise that we’ve chosen to take our stance on the kind of future we want to live in: ‘All Are Welcome. Always.'\" Unfortunately, Lush's UK stores will be stocked with Yuge before its Stateside counterparts but, until then, we can hope Yuge will be coming to a store near us soon.
