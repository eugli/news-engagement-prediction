Awards The Writer’s Guild of America was utterly merciless on Sunday night—especially hosts Lewis Black and Patton Oswalt. by Host Lewis Black. By Owen Hoffmann/PMC. The writers of America are ready to lead the revolution against Donald Trump . At the East Coast Writer’s Guild Awards on Sunday night (held concurrently with the West Coast ceremony), everyone from Seth Meyers to Pulitzer Prize winner John Patrick Shanley upheld the night’s unofficial theme of anti-Trump rhetoric. If there was any confusion about where the W.G.A. itself stands on the presidency, it was put to bed when the union’s executive director, Lowell Peterson , presented the Michael Collier Memorial Fellowship in Screenwriting award. As he spoke, the word RESIST filled the space of every TV screen in the room. “It’s time for us to act outside the box,” Peterson said as the room cheered. Host Lewis Black , righteously enraged as ever, set the tone for the evening, skewering awards shows (“I’ve never been nominated for anything by you”) and lobbing sharp barbs at Trump. “Donald Trump couldn’t handle what you handle,” he told the crowd at the New York ceremony at the Edison Ballroom in Manhattan, which included stars like Tina Fey , John Waters , David Simon , Danielle Brooks , filmmaker Alex Gibney , and Atlanta star Brian Tyree Henry . By Owen Hoffmann/PMC. Black continued, speaking about the surreal experience of watching Trump’s latest unraveling press conference . “Once again, I was forced to realize we are living at the intersection of satire and reality . . . how am I supposed to make that shit show funnier? We are living in fictional times,” Black continued. He then ran down the list and insulted everyone in Trump’s circle, including Kellyanne Conway , Ben Carson , and Steve Bannon (“You know why he scares me? Because he looks like how I feel when I have a hangover”), before circling back to Trump: “It’s actually an insult to call him a baby, because babies have more control over their colon than he has over his mouth.” There were more political highs throughout the night (and at the Los Angeles ceremony as well, including these opening remarks by Patton Oswalt , who made jokes about Russian security guards and called himself a “healthy Steve Bannon,” before his speech was bizarrely interrupted by James Woods ). While presenting a documentary award, Seth Meyers made a quick joke about wanting to make a doc himself about Bobby Jindal ’s short-lived presidential campaign. “We picked the wrong horse,” he lamented, before adding that the former Louisiana governor’s candidacy didn’t seem so “fucking crazy, based on what happened”—after all, Jindal had actually held office before running for president. While accepting the show’s win for comedy/variety—sketch series (as Tina Fey demurely hid behind the stage curtain), Saturday Night Live writer Sarah Schneider made a quick reference to the show's tireless Trump coverage. “Despite what my mother’s friends tell me, it doesn’t write itself. It’s not funny until the writers make it so.” And when presenting Jelani Cobb (who delivered the most poignant speech of the night) with the Walter Bernstein Award, Michael Winship , the president of the W.G.A. East—introduced by the show’s announcer as a president “who actually won the popular vote”—picked up where Lowell left off later in the night. “God bless a free and independent media. This union will work with our writers to continue to resist, to push back, to make voices heard. We will fight this with our words and with our actions and on the streets, as we’ve been doing since this inauguration.” Cigar-chomper Triumph the Insult Comic Dog also tossed in some Trump digs while presenting the children's special awards. He praised The Americans (the night's best drama winner), calling it “the story of Russian spies infiltrating the United States—or, as Donald Trump calls it, the feel-good show of the year!” He continued, “I guess the W.G.A. thought it would be fun for the children’s category to be presented by a foul-mouthed puppet—but unfortunately, Sean Spicer wasn’t available.” Trump did not completely dominate the night, however. FX comedy Atlanta was one of the show’s big winners, nabbing best comedy series and best new series, while Moonlight and Arrival were respectively awarded best original and adapted screenplay. David Letterman , in full bearded glory, sent in a surprise video to honor comedy writer Steve O’Donnell , who was receiving the Herb Sargent award. The legendary former late night host appeared, curiously, to be sitting in a gym in front of a rack of basketballs. “Wish I could be there, but I’m here at my new job, working at Dicks,” Letterman cracked. He rounded out his funny, off-the-cuff speech with this non-sequitur: “Your first wife hated me.” While accepting the Ian McLellan Hunter Award, cult hero John Waters (who earned two standing ovations) kept things largely politics-free, focusing his speech on championing the rights of writers and thanking the WGA for “validating the lunatic fringe of cinema . . . I clawed my way to the top of the trash heap.” “I wouldn’t suck your lousy dick if I was suffocating and there was oxygen in your balls!” he said, quoting his own 1974 film Female Trouble . “I wrote that! Oh, we had dialogue then.” Waters closed his speech by quoting a line from his latest film, Dirty Shame : “Make a list of all the people you fucked, and then apologize to their parents.” “See? I got an award for writing that line!” Waters exclaimed. “Anything is possible.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:07:13.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
