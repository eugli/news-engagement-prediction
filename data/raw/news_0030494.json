Women and girls are being given dangerous contraceptives because of the high chance of getting raped on the journey TAHA JAWASHI/AFP/Getty Images \nPeople traffickers are reportedly injecting migrant girls with a hazardous contraceptive because of the high likelihood they will be raped on their journey. \nIn large amounts or in girls too young to safely receive it, the hormone, progesterone, can bring on the menopause prematurely. \nBut smugglers in sub Saharan Africa are apparently giving it to children as young as 13 – who often travel unaccompanied -- to prevent pregnancy following a sexual assault. \nSexual violence is an extremely common occurrence on the migrant trail in northern Africa and is often perpetrated by drivers and middle men – the very people the travellers depend on to get to Europe. May accused of 'shabby cop out' over decision to end lone child refugee scheme \nMany come from chaotic and war torn countries such as Nigeria, South Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea. \nThe trend has been noticed by humanitarians working in areas of Europe which are key entry points for migrants, such as on the Italian island of Lampedusa. Syrian refugee tells of her journey on the ‘death road’ \nHelen Rodriguez, a gynaecologist working on the island, told The Sunday Times : “They know they are very likely to be raped en route so they have these injections in Ethiopia or Sudan to not get pregnant.” \nHowever, she said most girls didn’t realise the “the terrible long-term effects” of the contraceptive they were given. \nDr Rodriguez told the newspaper nearly a fifth of Eritrean girls she had seen were not menstruating because of the progesterone injections. \nThe risk of being raped is just one of many migrants must face as they attempt to get to Europe from sub Saharan African countries. \nThe journey is made overland through the desert, which is frequented by bandits, and then across the Mediterranean in dinghies. Last year, more than 5,000 people drowned trying to cross the sea. \nHowever, once inside Europe, women and children are not safe from sexual violence. In particular, the Dunkirk camp, “sexual assault, violence and rape are all far too common,” a volunteer told the Observer .
