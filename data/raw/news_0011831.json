Clark St. “It’s a hate crime. . . . We need to make an example of this person and have them apprehended and prosecuted to the fullest.”\nChicago Loop Synagogue member Jerry Schur, community activist Raul Montes, synagogue member Franklin Sabes and Rabbi Avraham Kagan of Chabad River North at a news conference Sunday. | Mitch Dudek/Sun-Times\nPolice received a call at 12:20 a.m. Saturday for “criminal damage in progress” at the temple at 16 S. Clark St., according to Chicago Police.\nSurveillance video shows someone getting out of a dark-colored SUV, possibly a Toyota Highlander, and placing two swastika stickers on the front doors, police said. Then he takes out a metal object and smashes a plate glass window.\nThe suspect is described as a white male wearing dark clothing and a dark face mask, police said.\nSynagogue President Lee Zoldan said there have been no hate crimes directed at the Synagogue since it moved into the Loop location in 1959.\n“There was no warning,” Zoldan said. “People have asked me ‘Did you get any signals?’ The answer is no.”\n“I was in shock,” Zoldan said of the 1 a.m. phone call informing her of the incident. “I must say the Chicago Police were wonderful, prompt and courteous.”\nInvestigators told her that four digits on the vandals getaway car license plate were clearly visible.\nDoes she think the political climate played a role in the vandalism? “I can’t speculate,” Zoldan said.\nConstruction workers at a job site across the street saw the crime and called police. The outpouring of love has been amazing, she said.\n“People left flowers, brought food, offered to clean up . . . this was one act of violence, and there were probably 100 acts of kindness to compensate,” she said.\nZoldan said The Jewish Federation of Greater Chicago is holding a rally against hate at the Synagogue at noon Wednesday.\nFranklin Sabes, a member of the synagogue, said a woman placed several vases of white flowers near the smashed window hours after the vandalism occurred. Congregants also were flooded with notes and phone calls expressing support, and morning and afternoon services were packed with congregants Saturday, he said.\n“It was nasty, what happened was not good,” Sabes said. “But out of this there should be growth and positivity, and there is, people come together — and put it behind us. It’s a slap in the face. OK. Goodbye. Now we’ll get on with life.”\nRabbi Avraham Kagan, of Chabad of River North, was on hand Sunday to offer support. “In the Jewish tradition we don’t combat darkness with darkness, we combat darkness with light,” Kagan said.\nThe American Jewish Committee’s Chicago office condemned the attack, saying the incident comes amid a rise in incidents of anti-Semitism across the country.\n“The Chicago Jewish community will not be intimidated by anti-Semitic attacks on a house of worship,” AJC Chicago Director Amy Stoken said. “The right of all religious groups to practice their faith without fear is a fundamental American value. Chicagoans must speak together clearly that the hatred behind this destructive behavior will never be accepted.”\nCardinal Blase Cupich tweeted in support of the synagogue, saying, ‘Hate will not prevail.”\nWe stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters as they worship at Chicago Loop Synagogue this Sabbath.
