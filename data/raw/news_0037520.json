Suarez joined Barcelona in 2014 (Picture: Getty) \n‘There’s so many good teams in the PL but he would have given Liverpool a better chance,’ Gerrard told Bt. \n‘You’re guaranteed goals, assists, he just causes every opposition problems and creates a lot of space for the players around him. \n‘He’s relentless – that’s the word to sum him up. He scores great goals, all type of goals, he creates out of nothing. \n‘He occupies the whole back four by himself. He was an absolute dream to play with. He was always on the move so that you could pick him out. Just a phenomenal footballer. He’s gone to another level since he moved to Barcelona with his goal and assist return.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:48:02.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
