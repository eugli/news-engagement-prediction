Russian news agency Tass revealed today that air defence units in Moscow and Russia's Central Industrial District have been put on high alert. A Russian MOD statement said: 'As the combat crews of radar stations and antiaircraft missile systems detect unidentified aerial targets, air defence patrol fighter jets will be scrambled to classify them or notionally destroy them.' A close-up of a pilot is seen before the man fires missiles They missiles whizz through the air trailing a cloud of smoke as they head down to a target below The war game saw the units shoot down 30 aircraft However, Britain too has been forced to be watchful. An unspecified number of Typhoon aircraft were called to monitor two Russian Blackjack bombers which flew near British airspace earlier today. The incident is the latest example of Russian jets flying near to Britain, often as a way of testing the response time of their British counterparts. 'We can confirm that quick reaction alert Typhoon aircraft from RAF Lossiemouth and RAF Coningsby scrambled to monitor two Blackjack bombers while they were in the UK area of interest,' a Royal Air Force spokesman said in a statement. The newly released footage follows the announcement on Tuesday that Russia is readying itself for war - the latest in a series of drills amid tensions with the West Separately, the French air force said two of its Mirage military aircraft escorted the two bombers down the French coast before handing over to Spanish military planes. A French official said the incident was the fourth time Russian fighters had been intercepted on the French coast over the past two years, a period of tension between Russia and western European countries related to the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.
