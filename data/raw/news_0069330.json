She came into the industry in 2008 when she joined Mr Latin Production Institute to study the craft of acting. \nHowever, not everyone is aware that the Abeokuta based actress has a love child but she is willing to tell the whole world that she is a happy mother of one and her daughter remains her driving force. \nHow it started \nActing began for me from my primary school days. When I got to higher institution, I started doing stage plays which people paid to watch. While in the higher Institution, I joined Mr Latin theater school in Abeokuta. \nJoining the group gave me the necessary training I needed to thrive in my craft. I will always appreciate my boss, Otunba Bolaji Amusan aka Mr Latin for being there always for me. \nChallenges \nThe challenge of being a rising actress is the need to always be better than your previous performance. That is a personal challenge for me. \nPlanning a red carpet event \nThe first thing that comes to mind when preparing for a red carpet event is to dress appropriately and decently. I believe you can be classy without dressing provocatively. •Titi Adeoye \nBeing endowed \nHaving big boobs doesn’t really change anything. It can neither get me money in the bank nor can it alleviate the ongoing recession. What matters to me is becoming a valuable person to myself and the society at large. \nBleaching in Nollywood \nI believe people have different reasons for doing certain things. Those who bleach have their reasons for doing it. Although it’s a no for me, I can never bleach. I believe black is beautiful and I appreciate the colour God gave me. \nFinding my lover sleeping with my domestic staff \nMy lover sleeping with my domestic staff? Well, I don’t know until it happens. But I know it can never happen. \nGoing the extra mile for love \nWhen you love someone deeply you can sacrifice your all for the person. The truth test of love is sacrifice. \nIs marriage still far or close for you? \nWhen the time comes, it will happen. Marriage is not an institution you rush into. You shouldn’t allow social pressures make you marry in desperation. \nMy ideal man \nHe has to be focused, love God, be visionary, understand my career and be a man of integrity. \nProject \nYes! I am working on my own production. It’s going to be different and life-changing. I’m hitting location soon with a fantastic story about single mothers and the challenges of being one. \nMy daughter \nShe is the best thing that has ever happened to me. She is my driving force. \nMarrying a poor man \nAs much as money is important in a marriage, it is not the only thing I look out for. I look at traits like honesty, Integrity, fear of God, and vision. There are some things money cannot buy. \nDefinition of love \nLove is commitment to someone. What we call love these days is people manipulating one another. The proof of love is sacrifice. If you claim to love someone or something, you will go the extra mile for it and stay committed to it no matter what happens.
