Huberty’s analyst note actually reiterates a variety of different rumors, including that the upcoming flagship will be “higher priced,” will feature an OLED display, and more: \n“In addition to more modest updates to current iPhone SKUs, we expect Apple to launch a higher priced device with AMOLED display that allows for a curved form factor and longer battery life, wireless charging technology, 3D sensors, and more advanced AI software capabilities. While we see accelerated upgrades for Apple’s highest end users in all regions, our work suggests China users are especially sensitive to new technology and form factor changes.” \nThis isn’t the first time that the iPhone 8’s battery life has been rumored to be getting an upgrade. Earlier this month, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo outlined how he believes that Apple will put a battery that’s comparable in size to the iPhone 7 Plus, but in the form factor of a device with a smaller 4.7-inch frame . \nIt’s hard to argue that longer battery life in any version of an upcoming iPhone is a bonus, and for anyone who has been holding onto their phone for a couple of years, or more, it’s certainly something to consider when looking to upgrade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:33:54.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
