(ABC Rural: Cara Jeffrey) \nThe Dunns shear all their own sheep but with Charlie starting kindergarten, they have had to restructure their program so that Charlie doesn't miss a thing. \n\"We are not allowed to shear during the week while he is at school now, so it looks like there'll be more weekend shearing,\" Mr Dunn said. \nOn some days, Charlie has already had a busy morning drafting his lambs even before hopping on the school bus. \n\"I love shearing the long blow [from the sheep's tail to its neck] and the belly. You take all the wool off and not cut them,\" Charlie said. Watching and learning \nAnd as soon as school is over for the day, it is back to the boards for Charlie. \n\"I have to get changed, I then run down to the shed and draft them and get them in and shear them,\" he said. Photo: Charlie is desperate to use a mechanical handpiece. (ABC Rural: Cara Jeffrey) \nMs Dunn said her son's shearing technique was very good for a five-year-old. \n\"Basically he spent a lot of time with us; we shear all our sheep so we shear a fair bit,\" she said. \n\"He's picked it up from watching Clint and from us taking him out when we did wool classing, roustabouting and shearing jobs and he's just become crazy about it. \n\"A lot of people are pretty impressed with how he knows all the blows that you are supposed to do.\" \nHis mum said Charlie was desperate to start using a mechanical shearing handpiece. \n\"I think it's a bit dangerous to be using one by himself, so he's taken up using a pair of blade shears,\" she said. \n\"We always cut the dots off them with the blade shear, so I think he has seen that and thought I can shear with a pair of these and away he's gone.\" \nCharlie has got the shearing shed banter down pat too and likes to compare his runs on the board with his colleagues.. \n\"He's a character, he stirs up the shearers [and] will let them know if they've cut one,\" Ms Dunn said. \n\"He's always asking how many they have shorn and they like to see how many he's done.\" School a temporary stop on journey to shearing shed \nMr and Ms Dunn admit both were keen on shearing when they were children, but doubt they were ever as eager as their son. \n\"I don't think my passion started quite as young as his,\" Mr Dunn said. \n\"When dad was away shearing, us kids would be pretty keen to shear the pets [but] I think I would have been 12 to 13 when I first held a handpiece.\" \nAnd while he may have only just started school, the Dunns anticipate shearing will be Charlie's career of choice. \n\"I can't see him doing anything else,\" Ms Dunn said. \n\"I don't think I'm going to keep him at school very long. He's going to be gone and shearing pretty young.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:54:54.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
