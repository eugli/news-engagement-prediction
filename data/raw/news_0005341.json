Oscar Keserci’s jaw-dropping images show silhouettes of solitary trees, deserted beaches, empty roads and solo figures illuminated by the dramatic explosion of a million stars above. Mr Keserci told MailOnline Travel that night photography takes a lot of planning to get the best results with ‘many hours of driving’ and ‘staying up all night' involved. He said: ‘Watching the stars, the Milky way and the Northern Lights is something magical which we are not able to witness during day time. Also, I really like the silence and the feeling of being alone.’ The talented photographer took up his craft in 2013 after moving back to Finland having spent much of his life growing up in Rhodes. He shoots on two different DSLR cameras using long exposures, a wide lens and tripod. Alongside the nocturnal scenes Mr Keserci also takes stunning landscape pictures and has amassed a following of over 10,000 fans on Facebook and 4,000 on Instagram.
