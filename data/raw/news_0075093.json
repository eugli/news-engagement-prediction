Meanwhile, baby boomers (55-70 years old) are among Trump's staunchest supporters. \nConsider the numbers for Trump's job approval. \nOr look at the stances on Trump's temporary travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. \nThere are also pronounced divides on whether the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, is a \"good idea\" or a \"bad idea.\" \nSome of those divides may be associated with the larger split on Trump. In November's presidential exit polls, Hillary Clinton comfortably won voters younger than 45 years old (by 14 points) and Donald Trump won voters 45-and-older (by 8 points). These generational differences may simply be showing that those who voted for or against Trump are taking positions in support of or opposition to the president. \nAfter all, Trump's executive order on travel, and the way it was rolled out, was so directly tied to the president that it's probably hard for people to separate the order from the man. And Trump has made so many direct and negative comments about the Affordable Care Act that it may have gained in popularity among some supporters of former President Barack Obama. \nBut the generational splits in the latest poll seem to go deeper than that and extend into territory that is less explicitly political. For instance, on the question of whether trade with foreign countries has helped or hurt the United States, the divide is very noticeable. \nMillennials are big free traders; baby boomers are not. \nWith numbers like those, millennials and baby boomers don't just look like different age groups; they look like they come from very different Americas — and in many ways they do. \nSome of the differences: \nMillennials are a much more diverse group of people in the poll, only 62 percent are white and non-Hispanic. Among baby boomers, 78 percent are white and non-Hispanic. Millennials in the poll tend to be much more likely to live in urban places (40 percent) compared to baby boomers (21 percent of them live urban places). And millennials have higher levels of educational attainment, 37 percent in the poll have at least a bachelor's degree. Among baby boomers that figure is 29 percent. \nThose differences may also help explain why the two age groups have different attitudes towards Trump's executive order. And it may help explain differences in opinion on free trade. Millennials are more likely to have at least a bachelor's degree and those with a bachelor's tend to be less threatened by the job displacement associated with trade. \nWhy does this all matter? Because the politics of today is always setting up the politics of tomorrow. \nThe first divisive month of Trump's presidency looks like it is very much a baby boomer affair. And with policies and the support he is getting from the Republicans in the House and Senate, he is pulling the Republican Party onto that track as well. \nThat may be a prescription for short-term success for the president and the GOP. But in the longer term, the future of the country belongs to millennial voters and they don't see a lot to like in the president and his policies.
