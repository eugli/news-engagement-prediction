Close calls \nProsecutor Pete Holmes said the faulty operation of drones was a \"serious public-safety issue that will only get worse\" and more prosecutions could follow. \nRavi Vaidyanathan, a drone expert from Imperial College London, said he was \"not aware of anything previously resulting in jail time\". \nHe said it was inevitable more accidents would follow and called on the regulatory bodies that governed drone use to provide \"a consistent set of guidelines on usage\". \n\"In the US, there are rules for commercial use but different ones for hobbyists,\" he said. \n\"In the UK, rules are governed by the size of aircraft, so in my understanding anything under 20kg [3st 2lb] can be flown without regulation. \n\"We are in uncharted territory, but the guidelines have to be consistent.\" \nHe added the inconvenience to the public was also \"non-trivial\". \n\"Having a drone buzzing around does not add to most people's beach experience, for example, and we need to think about this too.\" \nDuring the past fiscal year, more than 1,200 possible collisions between an aircraft and a drone were reported to the Federal Aviation Administration. \nThe FAA was unable to confirm any strikes, but it has reported several close calls, including a Lufthansa jet approaching Los Angeles that passed within 200ft (60m) of a drone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:00:52.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
