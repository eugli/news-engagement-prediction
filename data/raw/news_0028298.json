Here's how to celebrate your favourite female friends today Monday 13 February 2017 10:00 GMT Click to followES Lifestyle Chill out with popcorn at The Berkeley to celebrate Galentine's Day in style The Berkeley \nForget Valentine's Day , a new romantic annual holiday is gathering momentum - and it's much more fun. \nGalentine's Day takes place today, 13th February, and incorporates the sending of cards, flowers (yes, yes, cuddly toys) to someone you truly love. \nBut rather than spoiling your partner, the annual day is all about getting together your favourite female friends and showing your appreciation for them in all manner of soppy ways. \nYou're probably thinking you've never heard of it. But if you're a woman, chances are you've participated in it anyway. Because if you have ever sent a card or flowers to a woman around Valentine's Day, you've sent a Galentine. Put simply, Galentine's is Valentine's - for 'gals'. \nBecause while romantic partners come and go, everyone knows that friendships are forever. \nWhere did it come from: \nGalentine's Day originated from the States in 2010, specifically, comedy sitcom Parks and Recreation . During Episode 16, Series 2, 'Galentine's Day' was where leading character Leslie Knope brought together a group of lady friends to celebrate... ladies. What to do in London for Valentine’s Day 2017 \nDubbed 'only the best day of the year', Knope (played by actress Amy Poehler) explained that Galentine's Day was the day where 'my lady friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home and we just come and kick it, breakfast style.' \nWhen it happens: \nKnope celebrated it on February 13 (i.e. the day before Valentine's Day), but it is not so strictly marked here in the UK. Any gathering of women to celebrate women around Valentine's Day, therefore, can be considered a Galentine's celebration. \nHow it works: \na) Send flowers... that aren't roses \nRecent research conducted by online florist Bloom & Wild into buying patterns around Valentine's Day revealed there is a high percentage of female-to-female gifting this time of year - circa 35-40 per cent in 2015. \n\"Everyone thinks of Valentine's Day as a time where men buy flowers for their female significant others,\" said Bloom & Wild founder Aron Gelbard, \"but actually we found that there was a high participation in the Valentine's market of female-to-female buyers. Often that's not women buying flowers for another woman they're in a relationship with, but somebody that they want to express some sort of care for.

That [might be] because they're elderly and their partners aren't around anymore, or because they're single. It's actually a time where a lot of women in particular tend to be very thoughtful and use the occasion to buy flowers for women who might not be receiving them from a significant other.\" \nBloom & Wild's research also uncovered that unlike men - who typically opt for traditional red roses - women will send 'softer' bouquets, like pink roses and alstroemerias, costing typically between £25 and £30. \nb) Get together for a girls night in... or out \nIt might have been coined in recent years, but Galentine's Day as a concept has been around for a while. What proves this? Its depictions on the small and silver screens. \nIn 1995 there was that episode of Friends , 'The One With The Candy Hearts', where Rachel, Monica and Phoebe get together on Valentine's Day to burn momentos of past lovers. (They end up causing a house fire.) \nAnd let's not forget that scene in Sex And The City: The Movie (2008) where Carrie and Miranda go out for dinner on February 14, and end up having a colossal row in a restaurant... \nThankfully, real-life Galentine's gatherings tend to be happier affairs. Lucy, 30, from London says they're \"the best\", recalling a particular year where \"two girlfriends and I drank prosecco and sloe gin whilst watching Bridget Jones , eating whole pizzas to ourselves - bliss.\" Valentine’s Day Gift Guide 2016: for her \nc) Giving cards (not anonymously) \nThis is possibly the most common manifestation of the trend. Many women will send cards to their female friends as a way of reinforcing their friendship, whilst posting heartfelt messages to female family members is popular too. \nFitness blogger Poppy Cross, 30, from London says, \"I don't send cards to my friends who aren't in relationships because I think they probably want to forget it's Valentine's Day... I do, however, send them to my sisters and mother because it's a sweet way to tell them they're the ones I care about the most.\" \nBloom & Wild's research also suggested that typically women 'reveal' themselves in messages, to let the recipient know who is thinking of them. \"It's not so much an anonymous gesture,\" says Gelbard, \"it's a thoughtful gesture.\" \nGalentine's things to do in London... \nGift your Galentine an experience at Sense Spa in Rosewood London in Midtown. \n252 High Holborn, WC1V, 020 7781 8888; rosewoodhotels.com \nGo out for a 'Girls Night In ' at The Berkeley, a.k.a take a suite with a girlfriend and get spoiled rotten. \nThe Berkeley, Wilton Place, SW1X, 020 7235 6000; the-berkeley.co.uk \nGet creative at the Pottery Café - with studios on both sides of the river, ladies, there's no excuse. \n153 Northcote Road, SW11, 020 7223 3388 and 735 Fulham Road, SW6,020 7736 2157; pottery-cafe.com \nFollow Edwina on Twitter @edwinalangley More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T21:37:48.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
