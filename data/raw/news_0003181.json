(Jacob Langston/Orlando Sentinel) \nIronically, Clayton understood this issue was a problem well before Markeith Loyd entered the picture. She wrote for her book’s blurb that a lack of confidence and trust in law enforcement “can adversely impact cooperation for reporting crimes and proving information vital to solving crimes.” \nWith the author gone, Young is now left with a conundrum — does she scratch the project or publish the life’s work of her late friend? It’s not about the book — it’s about her mission, her legacy. — Ty Young An early proof of Lt. Debra Clayton's book cover. Ty Young An early proof of Lt. Debra Clayton's book cover.

(Ty Young) \n“It’s not about the book — it’s about her mission, her legacy,” Young said. \nYoung said she fears publishing the book without Clayton’s direction, but feels she must advocate for her friend’s mission. \n“So many people want a piece of her, and that book was her intellectual property,” Young said. “I’m waiting on the estate to tell me where they want the proceeds to go.” \nClayton’s family would also like to move forward with publishing the book, her sister, Nikki Anita Huey, said. They are working with Young, but there is currently no release date. \nThe book is designed to help law enforcement professionals work with diverse communities by using three key elements Clayton learned from research and personal background — humility, empathy and experience, Young said. \n“She rose through the ranks through love and understanding who she was engaging with,” Young said. “She was a celebrity in the community … and Supergirl because of her heart.” \nClayton wanted to “heal” her community and the book, along with a non-profit organization of the same name, were her next ideas on how to tackle that goal, Young said. There was something driven in her to get this project done. — Ty Young Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton enjoyed interacting with residents in the community.

Clayton loved her law enforcement brethren and community equally, and knew tensions between the two needed to be relaxed. \n“The climate was so thick, people weren’t sure of her approach to this conversation,” Young said. “She didn’t want perceptions of ‘what side she was on.’ She was directly in the middle.” \nYoung and Clayton’s family are considering options on how to publish and distribute the book. Young is expecting to see first proof of the book Friday. \n“I wish I would be handing that book to [Clayton] and seeing her jump up and down with her huge smile,” Young said. \nHuey said the family would like the book to be available “as soon as possible.” \nIn the meantime, the book is up for presale online for $20 at http://leocunity.org . \ncdoornbos@orlandosentinel.com or 407-650-6931  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:32:15.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
