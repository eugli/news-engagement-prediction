This needs to stop if we want our work to be credible.\n“That is why the Malaysian Code of Responsible Conduct in Research will be introduced to raise the compatibility and reliability not only of our research efforts but also our development and innovation initiatives,” he said.\nThe code will also spell out how those who breach ethics will be dealt with but details are not immediately available.\nThe Prime Minister said the council must look at how innovation and creativity could play an important role in the National Transformation 2050 (TN50) efforts, adding that the two elements were needed to create a nation that has “par excellence” mindset and attitude.\n“It is clear that Malaysia’s development and progress in the future depends highly on our ability to master science and technology, and to prepare the future generation to adapt and be competitive in any situation.\n“That is why the National Science Council is extremely important to ensure the science, technology and innovation sector would continue to grow and evolve, in line with progress made around the globe, so that we can be an equal among developed nations,” said Najib.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:29:49.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
