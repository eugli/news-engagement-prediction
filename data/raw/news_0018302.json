Take a look at what happened below. \nAfter his career is eventually over, he will likely have a career in the entertainment business. \nThose reactions were perfect. \nHere are some other highlights in his well-rounded performance. \nIt looked like squaring off against the Warriors gave Cousins some extra motivation to show off his skills against a clearly superior opponent. \nWhile he can cause some headaches off the court and in the locker room, there are few that can hang with Boogie on the hardwood. \nHe proved that yet again on Saturday night.
