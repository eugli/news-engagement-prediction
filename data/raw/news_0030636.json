Beyoncé ’s viral twin pregnancy announcement photo is now officially a five-story mural in Australia, thanks to renowned street artist Lushsux. \nThe anonymous artist hinted that he had the concept in the works last week, when he retweeted Beyonce’s picture along with a call for open public spaces to display his work. A photo posted by Beyoncé Australia (@beyonceaus) on Feb 9, 2017 at 7:46pm PST \nAnd on February 10, a little over a week after Queen Bey dropped the stunning baby announcement to Instagram, the mural was done. “Five stories of @beyonce Does it look like I'm expecting twins too?” the artist can be seen kneeling in the foreground of the impressive mural with his hands cradling what looks like a large belly, his face completely covered up for anonymity.

Most recently, the artist has created an enormous mural of Obama ’s face scrunched up in laughter with the speech bubble, “Miss Me Yet?” floating by his smiling mouth. \nAnother features a shirtless Vladimir Putin riding a bear through a stream and President Donald Trump sitting atop an American eagle on the same shared wall. PHOTOS: Viral Stars: 2016's Biggest Internet Celebrities \nLast March, Lushsux’s artwork drew much buzz after he created a 20-foot tall mural of Kanye West making out with himself on the side of Zigi’s Wine and Cheese Bar in Sydney, Australia. “No one can love Kanye quite like Kanye,” he wrote at the time. \nIn July, an “RIP Taylor Swift” mural cropped up in Melbourne, Australia after an all-out war broke out between Kim Kardashian and the pop singer; shortly afterward, the mural was painted over to resemble, instead, Cincinnati Zoo gorilla Harambe. PHOTOS: Celebrity Feuds: The Biggest Ever! \nBut the next day, somebody took to the mural once more and painted over Harambe’s face with Swift’s nemesis West. \n“WHO DID THIS?!?!” the artist account captioned a photo of the freshly painted mural . The words had been changed to read “In Loving Memory of… Haramye The Savage 2016. Murdered Taylor Smith on Snapchat.” \nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!
