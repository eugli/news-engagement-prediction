With the rapidly changing ground situation, a thrilling contest among SAD-BJP, Congress and the newbie AAP is on the cards. On poll day, Chitleen K Sethi finds out what pundits, soothsayers and Shimla’s fortune-telling parrot Ganga Ram have to say on how the three players will fare in these high-stakes elections. \nSUNIDHI MEHRA , Gurgaon-based tarot card reader, who has 12 years of experience \nMADAN GUPTA SPATU Chandigarh-based astrologer with 45-year experience \nN D KHETARPAL , a Chandigarh numerologist with 41 years of experience \nSURESH TEWARI , Hoshiarpur-based Bhrigu Shastri, with 21 years of experience \nWHAT THE SAY \nWhich party will form the next government in Punjab? \nSunidhi Mehra : Tarot cards point towards a hung assembly with the Congress emerging as the single-largest party. Kejriwal is set to play kingmaker and is likely to support Congress to form the government. \nMadan Gupta Spatu: No single party will get a clear majority. Congress may have to enter into alliances with smaller parties to form the government. AAP will emerge as an important player but not gain power. \nND Khetarpal: The Aam Aadmi Party is going to form the government in Punjab. Arvind Kejriwal’s numerological combination (date of polls and his name numbers) is indomitable. \nSuresh Tewari: No party will get clear majority. Stars predict that the alliance in power — SAD-BJP — will lose its influence in the state and will be dominated by other smaller groups. \nWhat will be the party-wise seat share? \nSunidhi Mehra : Congress will bag more than 50 seats, followed by SAD-BJP (40) and AAP (around 30). \nMadan Gupta Spatu: It is not possible to predict the number of seats each party will get. \nND Khetarpal: AAP will get 50-60 seats. The Congress share will be 40-50, SAD-BJP alliance (20-25). \nSuresh Tewari: The Congress will get 45-55 seats followed by the AAP 35-45 and SAD-BJP (over 20). \nWho will be the next chief minister? \nSunidhi Mehra : Amarinder Singh will be the CM but not for long. He will give way to Navjot Singh Sidhu who has the most favourable cards. \nMadan Gupta Spatu: Amarinder is passing through a promising period (from June 1, 2016 to October 1, 2017) that can make him CM. \nND Khetarpal: Kejriwal will lead the state. Also, Captain’s numbers show him in a fairly strong position. Numbers don’t back Sukhbir. \nSuresh Tewari: Capt’s chances of becoming the CM are the brightest. Kejriwal won’t be the CM but will play a key role in govt formation. \nMEET GANGA RAM, THE ORACLE WITH WINGS The parrot, Ganga Ram, was given handwritten white chits to pick. (Deepak Sansta/HTPhoto) \nThe red-beaked Ganga Ram is no ordinary parrot. This avian soothsayer in the picturesque Shimla has to his credit (if we believe his owner) many correct predictions. \nThe parrot was given handwritten white chits to pick. Among the four options on who will come to power in Punjab — Congress, AAP, SAD-BJP or hung House — the parrot chose the Congress. Among CM candidates — Captain Amarinder Singh, Parkash Singh Badal, Bhagwant Mann, HS Phoolka and Arvind Kejriwal, Ganga Ram chose Amarinder. \nSimilarly, the fortune-telling parrot predicted over 60 seats for the Congress, 41-50 for AAP and 31 to 40 for the SAD-BJP alliance. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:35:35.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
