John Davis, Joel Silver, and Lawrence Gordon — who produced the original — are returning for the reboot as well. Fox has already scheduled “The Predator” for a Feb. 9, 2018, opening. \nMajor plot details are being kept under wraps other than the movie being set in suburbia. “Narcos” star Boyd Holbrook replaced Benicio del Toro as the lead back in October. The cast also includes Jacob Tremblay, Trevante Rhodes, Olivia Munn, Sterling K. Brown, and Keegan-Michael Key. \nThe original “Predator” was directed by John McTiernan and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, and Jesse Ventura as commandos attempting to rescue hostages while being stalked in a jungle in Central America by a fearsome extra-terrestrial, played by Kevin Peter Hall. \nAlfie Allen, who plays Theon Greyjoy on “Game of Thrones,” will portray an ex-Marine. Shooting has started in Vancouver. \nIn addition to “Game of Thrones,” Allen played a Russian gangster who kills Keanu Reeves’ dog in 2014’s “John Wick.” He was also recently honored as one of Variety ‘s 10 Brits to Watch in 2017 . \nHe is repped by UTA, Untitled and U.K.’s The Artists Partnership.
