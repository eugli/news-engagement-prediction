Ultimately people trusted the Labour government to solve them. \n“Their only hope is that one of us would fall for their provocation,” Dr Muscat added. \nIn his address the Prime Minister lauded his government’s track record saying “nothing was impossible” for the Labour Party. \n“We are punching above our weight when compared with other Mediterranean islands. This applies for the economy, job creation, investment, and career opportunities. Successes are being achieved even though we do not their natural resources,\" he remarked. \nThe Prime Minister noted that, in the past four years, Labour had created enough job opportunities not only for the Maltese, but also for 30,000 foreigners. At the same time the government had been balancing its books, reducing the deficit and reducing taxes. \nThe choice for the people would be between going back to mediocrity or to continue to leap ahead to eclipse the achievements made so far. \nHealth \nDr Muscat noted that certain issues which until a few years ago seemed impossible, such as providing students with free electronic tables, addressing the problem of out-of-stock medicines and reducing operation waiting lists, were being solved or implemented. \nThe government’s target was to attract medical tourism to Malta rather than have Maltese patients travelling for treatment. \nTourism and ITS site \nThe Prime Minister pointed out that until a few years ago, the idea was that inbound tourism could never exceed 1.5 million a year, but this year this had been exceeded as the number of foreign visitors reached two million. \nThis was in spite of the 50c tax per night per visitor. \nThe game changer, Dr Muscat said, would no longer be to boost arrivals, but to raise standards, attract wealthier visitors and in turn increase hotel rates. \nDr Muscat remarked that this would help improve wages in the sector, which would attract more Maltese people to this industry. This was why the government was building a new ITS campus at Smart City, he added. \nHe refuted criticism that the land had been sold for a cheap price, noting that at €60 million, this was the biggest price ever paid for a tract of government land. \nThe Prime Minister noted that each square metre of gross floor area at ITS was sold at €1,250 while under the PN government each square metre at Smart City was sold for 40c. « Opposition to present bill for removal of precautionary warrants against journalists Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=72137311613&n=3dee0936' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=72137311613&n=3dee0936' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T13:55:36.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
