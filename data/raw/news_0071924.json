Photo: Photorun.net \nShalane Flanagan announced on Facebook that she will be withdrawing from this year’s Boston Marathon. According to her post, she fractured her lower back bone during a snowy training run in Portland, Ore. It was a tough call to make for the three-time Boston marathoner who has described Boston as her “favorite hometown race,” and has made it widely known that it’s her goal to win it one day. \n\nThis injury follows an impressive display of performances in 2016, including her 3rd place win at the U.S. Olympic Trials Marathon in February, a new American 10K record in June, and then her sixth place finish at the Summer Olympics in Rio. Although Flanagan has expressed her disappointment in her inability to compete on April 17, the tenacious marathoner is far from giving up and already hopeful of her return next year. “One thing I know, is that marathoners are used to suffering and overcoming challenges. We come back to try again…and again.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:10:38.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
