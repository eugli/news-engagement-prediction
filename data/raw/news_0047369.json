After photos of several Qatar Airways employees spread on social media, the airline has issued a statement shedding light into the viral photographs. The photos which showed one of their female cabin crew staff were deemed inappropriate and have caused uproar in social media. The company issued a statement using their official Twitter account. - (@qatarairwaysar) February 16, 2017 Below is a translation of the tweet according to The Peninsula : \"It has recently been brought to our attention that inappropriate images of individuals who appear to be Qatar Airways cabin crew are appearing on social media sites. We understand that these images are being widely viewed and have caused concern and upset that they appear to show current members of the airline engaged in inappropriate and unacceptable acts in public. These images are historical, and were being circulated at the end of 2013/ early 2014 when they were first brought to our attention. At this time, the airline carried out its own internal investigations and as a result the individuals concerned had their employment terminated. All Qatar Airways employees are expected to behave professionally, and with respect to the laws and customs of Qatar, and its people. We are proud that the very vast majority of our employees represent themselves and our airline in an extremely positive and responsible manner, and incidents of this nature are very rare. When matters such as this do occur however, they are taken extremely seriously, and appropriate measures taken to address the incident in question, as was the case here. According to the tweet, the airline said that the images were old. After conducting an investigation on the photos, the staff involved had their jobs terminated. They clarified that the images were dated to early 2013-2014. Qatar Airways also added that their current staffs are trained to behave in a professional manner that is line with the laws and customs of Qatar.
