Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA dad has revealed why he has banned his six children from doing their homework - despite the fact they \"absolutely love\" it. \nDr Justin Coulson, a leading parenting expert, writes an annual letter to his kids' teachers , explaining his view on the matter. \nHe suggests that it is not only children who typically dislike the tradition (except his own), but also parents and teachers. \nHe then goes on to cite \"the growing body of evidence\" that homework can actually have a negative effect on primary school children.

It appears his stance is sometimes met with disbelief, as he feels the need to tell the teacher: \n\"As you will probably see, we have put a lot of effort into this letter, and we hope that you will take it seriously, and also recognise that we wish to make things better for all parties, and not more challenging.\" \nHis reasons for not encouraging his children to do homework include that it may increase teachers' workload, it can create stress for kids, it creates an \"extra burden\" on parents and it can cause family conflict. \nHe also claims that homework is \"generally not inspiring\" and it diminishes the time children have for other activities.

How involved should parents be? \nHis answer: reading and projects. These two \"exceptions\" to his stance on homework are specified in his letter. He says his children \"absolutely love\" doing homework (file picture) (Photo: Getty) \nOn reading, Dr Coulson says that diving into a book every day is strongly encouraged in his house. However, page quotas or minimum time requirements are not set. \nInstead, he says: \"When we simply remind the kids that reading time needs to happen, they immerse themselves in books and often only resurface after our pleas to come to the dinner table reach a crescendo!\" \nIt's clear that the child's enthusiasm for learning is paramount to Dr Coulson, who has written several books on parenting and has a doctorate in psychology.

But with patient help from parents or tutors, their homework has helped them excel (or at least catch up.).\" \nHe adds: \"Some kids just love doing homework. \n\"I’m not about to suggest that they should stop.\" poll loading Do you think children should be given homework? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T18:22:40.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
