But on Monday it seemed that Mr. Trump may have to do without one of the frequent trappings of such a visit — an invitation to address Parliament — after the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, publicly opposed such an appearance, citing his “opposition to racism and sexism.” The comments will embarrass both the British and American governments and add to the controversy over a planned state visit that has attracted opposition in Britain , where more than 1.8 million people have signed a petition urging the government to cancel Mr. Trump’s trip. The British prime minister, Theresa May, has insisted that the invitation to Mr. Trump stands. With Britain planning to leave the European Union, Mrs. May is eager to strike a quick trade deal with the United States, and British officials are hoping that the state visit may smooth those talks. But Mr. Bercow’s comments, made to lawmakers in Parliament and greeted with cheers from some deputies, are unlikely to help Mrs. May’s trans-Atlantic diplomacy.
