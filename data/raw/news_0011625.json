Celeste Smith, 19, was last seen at a friend's house on Tuesday night, a day after finding out that she was expecting.\nThe teenager, from Saltash, said she was going home to have a bath but never made it back and had told her mum she would be staying with mates overnight.\nIt's feared Celeste, who reportedly split up with her boyfriend last month, isn't coping, with pals warning \"her head is in a mess\".\n\"I just want her to come home. I know she has had problems with her ex-boyfriend and she found out she was pregnant on Monday. She was trying to cope with it but obviously she had lots of people in her ear telling her what she should do.\nHer ex-boyfriend broke up with her a few weeks ago but she never got a good explanation as to why, which was really breaking her. They were still speaking but the last conversation they had he turned around to her and said he wants nothing else to do with her. She took that pretty harsh. That really got to her. She was thinking they could be friends so hearing him say that really beat her down.\nHer head is going to be in a mess. I don't know how her head is going to be at the moment but it is going to be pretty bleak.\"\n– James Johnson, Celeste's best friend Celeste's mum, Julie Smith, 52, said she is \"terrified\" and issued an emotional plea for her daughter's safe return, saying she's \"desperate\" to have her home. She said she had \"no idea\" the teenager was pregnant until Friday, three days after she disappeared.\n\"We are desperate for her to come home.\nI last saw her on Monday and she was fine. She was telling me about her plans for the week and about meeting up with friends.\nWe have no idea where she is, nothing at at all. This is why it's so terrifying. There has been no contact from her at all. It's very out of character.\"\n– Julie Smith, Celeste's mum Concerns have also been raised that Celeste could have been harmed by a nightclub DJ who \"spiked her drink and half killed her a few weeks ago\".\nWriting online, Emma Corlett said: \"This is a long shot....but does anyone remember the visiting Plymouth nightclub DJ who spiked her drink and half killed her a few weeks ago?\"\nFriend's of Celeste raise concerns about a DJ Credit: Facebook/Celeste Smith MISSING, all info please!!! Celeste was last seen at around 6pm on Tuesday at a friend's house in Plymouth, Devon.\nConfusion over her whereabouts mean she wasn't reported missing until Thursday, when she failed to turn up after arranging to meet friends. More than 900 flyers have been printed in a bid to find Celeste, and a search party of around 20 people scoured Saltash yesterday. Today they are searching in Plymouth.\nDevon and Cornwall Police said the search is a 'high priority' and that \"family and friends are very worried about her\".\nA spokesperson for Saltash Police said: \"Celeste, you are in no trouble. We are concerned for you and want to ensure you are okay. Please get in touch.\"\nAnyone with information should call 101 quoting log number 616 01/02/17.\n Read more 5 updates Searches continue for missing Cornish teenager Devon Cornwall and Isles of Scilly", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:16:12.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
