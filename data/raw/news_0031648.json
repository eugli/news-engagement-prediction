Because its owners believe in training the body as a machine and not with machines, you won’t find treadmills or bikes here. Instead, there are dumbbells, kettlebells, medicine balls, suspension ropes and gymnastic rings that you’ll use during the sessions. \nDuring a 20-minute session, you’ll do different exercises such as burpees, push-ups, kettlebell swings and squats with minimal rest time (about 15 seconds) and with at least one trainer on the floor motivating you to pick up your pace. Each session can accommodate up to ten people, and starts every half-hour so there are no excuses to skip. Ritual also has a ‘fuel bar’ where you can treat yourself to a hard-earned post-workout protein shake. Clothes, towels and toiletries are provided and the shock-absorbent gym floor means no shoes are required – just rock up and work out.
