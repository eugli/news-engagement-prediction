The IDF spokesman said a \"tanks attacked a Hamas position in northern Gaza in response to rocket fire at Israel.\" Palestinian reports also said Israel had fired two shells at a command post along the border fence, in Beit Lahiya. Earlier a rocket fired from Gaza struck in an open area, causing no casualties, the Israeli army said. Rocket sirens wailed warning of a potential strike in the Ashkelon area, north of the Gaza Strip border. The last rocket fired at Israel from Gaza was in mid-January when an Israeli tank fired back. There were no reported casualties in these incidents. Monday's alert came a day after a Hamas field commander, Mohammed al-Kuka, 37, died of wounds suffered in an explosion the previous day . The circumstances of that explosion were not clear, but according to Palestinian media reports the blast occurred in a warehouse where explosive devices were made. Kuka was buried on Sunday in a funeral that turned into a show of strength for Hamasâ€™ military wing.
