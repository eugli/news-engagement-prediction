And it’s not clear how much faster or how many more problems would be turned up. But right now they are in the position of having to wait for these things to be filed.” Morcellators are still available, but their use in fibroid surgery has fallen considerably. In November 2014 the F.D.A. said the devices should no longer be used in “the vast majority” of women having fibroid surgery. Morcellators came onto the market in 1991 via an F.D.A. process known as 510 (k) , in which devices are cleared for use without going through the usual lengthy approval process, because they are similar to devices that have already been approved. The morcellators for uterine surgery were cleared because the F.D.A. considered them similar to tools used in minimally invasive knee operations and other orthopedic surgery — even though the orthopedic equipment had not been used inside the abdomen or pelvis, or for cancer. The F.D.A. knew when it first allowed morcellators for uterine surgery that there was a chance the devices could spew hidden tumors around. But the risk was thought to be small, with one in 500 to one in 10,000 women who had fibroids also having undetected cancer. Subsequent research found the risk was greater, about one in 350. The problem came to light in 2013 when Dr. Amy Reed, then 40, an anesthesiologist and the mother of six children, had her uterus removed because of fibroids at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. A biopsy after the operation found a hidden sarcoma, an aggressive type of cancer. Morcellation had spread the tumor, transforming it to advanced, Stage 4 cancer. \n  Dr. Reed and her husband, Dr. Hooman Noorchashm (pronounced NOOR-chash), a cardiothoracic surgeon, have been campaigning ever since to stop morcellation, hoping to spare other women from what happened to Dr. Reed. Dr. Noorchashm said the accountability office report resulted from his appeals to former Representative Mike Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who teamed up with a group of colleagues to ask for an investigation. Since 2013, Dr. Reed has been in a nearly constant battle against the cancer. She has undergone major operations for recurrences in her abdomen, lungs and spine, and has received chemotherapy , radiation, immunotherapy and experimental treatments. “It’s our new normal,” Dr. Noorchashm said. “I think the jury’s still out on how aggressively and successfully we can fight this. But we’re doing it anyway.” Correction: February 8, 2017 \nAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a former Pennsylvaniacongressman. He is Mike Fitzpatrick, not Mike Ryan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:06:00.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
