Image: RAJESH JANTILAL Diamond grills, shimmery dresses and a big win for young rapper NastyC were the highlights of the 16th MetroFM Music Awards last night. \nCelebs, dressed to the nines in designer garments, didn't disappoint on the black carpet at the Durban International Conference Centre event, themed What's Next is All That Matters. \nNomzamo Mbatha wore a long metallic olive dress created by Zama Zarth, the designer who also dressed her Isibaya co-star Jessica Nkosi, who wore a flowing brown dress. \nSaid Nkosi: \"I love it for its elegantly sexy sequins crossover top and the slit, which is sexy but tasteful.\" \nSinger Brenda Mtambo, who was nominated for two awards in best female and urban album, wore a \"Tiffany blue\" off-the-shoulder floor-length silk and lace dress made by Durban designer Muzi Mlambo. \nMy Truth singer Kelly Khumalo opted for a body-hugging beaded lilac dress which concealed her shoes. She won best female award for her My Truth album, beating hitmakers Babes Wodumo, Amanda Black and Mtambo. \nKhumalo took to the stage to perform a tribute to legendary music couple Letta Mbuli and Caiphus Semenya, which she performed with Mtambo. Nasty C scooped three awards. Image: Supplied \n\"I'm very honoured to perform the tribute to Mama Letta and Baba Caiphus, who were awarded a lifetime achievement award, because they are such deserving artists who are legends in this industry,\" said Khumalo. \nRapper Anatii wore black and white striped G-Star Raw pants, which he paired with a khaki top and finished off with designer Buscemi high-top clasp-detail lace-up sneakers, which cost up to R9,000, on which he had written \"Remember to pray\". \n\"The jacket I'm wearing is actually a vintage jacket. It's older than I am. And of course I've got my custom-made diamond-encrusted gold grill by dentist Lex Leo,\" said the rapper. \nBut the night belonged to 20-year-old Hell Naw rapper Nasty C (real name David Junior Ngcobo) who scooped three awards in best hip-hop, best new artist and best male album categories. \nHard on his heels was Amazulu singer Black, who scored two awards: best R&B single and listeners' choice award. Other winners who took home one award each were Idols SA season seven winner Musa Sukwene, who won best African pop gong and rapper Riky Rick, whose hit Sidlukotini scored him a hit single award. The kwaito award went to L'vovo. \nAfropop duo Mafikizolo won best-styled group award. All 21 category winners were awarded statues plus R100,000 cash. \nMetroFM station manager Sibongile Mtyali said: \"The awards continue to celebrate the diverse culture and unity that music brings to our society.\" Don't miss out on this story Login, upgrade or subscribe to continue reading.
