This is not North Korea, this is Malaysia. We have our laws,\" he said.  \nOn calls to revoke free visas for North Koreans visiting Malaysia, Mohamed Nazri said the move was not necessary. \n\"There is no need to revoke the visa as North Koreans aren't allowed to travel out of their country in the first place,\" he said. He added that only North Korean officials travelled here. \nJong-nam, 45, the estranged half-brother of North Korea leader Kim Jong-un, was assassinated on Feb 13 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 by two women who poisoned him. \nFour people have so far been arrested in relation to the case. They are Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, 28; Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25; North Korean Ri Jong-chol, 47, and Siti Aisyahâ€™s boyfriend, Muhammad Farid Jalaluddin, a Malaysian.   \nThe remand for Doan and Siti Aisyah was extended for a further seven days while the boyfriend would be released on police bail.  \nThe four North Koreans who were involved in the murder have returned to Pyongyang.  \nMalaysian police have requested the North Korean government hand them over.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:52:35.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
