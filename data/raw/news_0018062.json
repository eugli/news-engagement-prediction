Her comments come amid the shocking exposure of various alleged leaked notes from his personal email accounts - as it was alleged David was the victim of £1million blackmail plot. Unimpressed? The X Factor judge told her close friend to 'get a life', questioning why anyone would want to 'be a stupid knight anyway', during a furious rant Not for me? The scandal has shaped around David not receiving a knighthood In the leaked messages, David allegedly took aim at singer Katharine Jenkins, branding her a 'f***ing joke' among other expletive-ridden rants. And Sharon, who has known the Beckhams for years, couldn't hold back her true feelings towards the former Manchester United ace in her interview. 'I am disappointed,' she confessed. 'I love the Beckhams, always have. 'I think they are a most amazing couple and when you see a couple like this that have an incredible family and they have both got amazing careers, and then David does all this charity work.' 'And if it were, because we don't know, the case that he was doing this for ulterior motives of getting a knighthood I would be really, really disappointed at that – because I look at him one way. 'Not that my opinion is important, I really respect him.' Oh dear: Despite being given a chance to defend the football ace, the 64-year-old admitted her opinion had changed after seeing the messages Not holding back: 'The thing that gets me is who does want to be a stupid knight anyway. Who does?' she questioned boldly Beckham and his PR machine have been left reeling after Friday's release of 18.6million emails and documents hacked by the Football Leaks website from the servers of Doyen Global, the firm run by the ex-footballer's PR chief Simon Oliveira. According to the revelations, the Honours Committee had already agreed that Beckham's nomination – almost certainly proposed by his PR advisers – was well 'merited' before a routine check of his tax affairs. The leaked emails also include a number of bombshells and series of sweary-rants and may even have been used as part of a £1million blackmail plot. In one message the ex-England captain allegedly claims singer Katharine Jenkins, 36, got an OBE for ‘singing at the rugby and going to see the troops plus taking coke. F g joke’. Candid: Sharon added: 'I am sorry you are still the same person. I just think really is that what you were working towards really?' (pictured, the Beckhams in 2012) She was given an OBE in the 2014 New Year Honours for her services to music and charity. Her manager, Professor Jonathan Shalit, told Dan Wootton at The Sun that she deserved her award for her charity work and music career. A spokesman for Beckham said: 'This story is based on outdated material taken out of context from hacked and doctored private emails from a third party server and gives a deliberately inaccurate picture.' He allegedly wrote the private message after he missed out on a knighthood, while other emails are said to show him call the honours committee 'unappreciative c****. But it now seems the former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder could have been a victim of a targeted blackmail plot. Awkward: In the leaked messages, David allegedly took aim at singer Katharine Jenkins, branding her a 'f***ing joke' among other expletive-ridden rants The emails were passed to the Football Leaks website after the firm run by his advisers refused to pay the hackers, reports Tom Bryant at the Daily Mirror. A source told the newspaper that Beckham - who earned 115 caps playing for England - was simply 'caught in the crossfire'. The messages were reportedly accessed after criminals - thought to be using Russian servers - hacked documents from the sports agency run by Mr Oliveria. They demanded one million euros - almost £900,000 - or they would pass on the material they had acquired, according to the Mirror.
