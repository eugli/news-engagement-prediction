The Billikens, however, have had some bright spots in a season that was bound to be a rebuilding year under a new regime. Namely, they have recorded only a pair of two-game winning streaks this season. A victory tonight would have given them their first three-game streak of the season. \nThat didn't happen. Instead, St. Bonaventure bounced back from a crushing overtime loss to VCU to defeat Saint Louis 70-55 and drop the Billikens to 8-16. \nAnother crushing defeat. \nBut the bad news didn't stop there. \nAfter the game, the Billikens got hit with another doozy: Their team bus apparently left without them. This is true. The bus driver left without the team and is on the loose. This is a first in 26 yrs of broadcasting. https://t.co/iZSY9mUfs1 — Earl Austin Jr. (@earlaustinjr) February 9, 2017 \nIt stinks being stranded, no doubt. And stinks even worse that the team isn't in their hometown. Afterwards they had a little fun on Twitter sharing a photo of the team lounging around. What else would they be doing? Just chilling in the Reilly Center while we try to find our missing bus. #SCNotTop10 pic.twitter.com/Au9LwpofO1 — SLU Men's Basketball (@SaintLouisMBB) February 9, 2017 \nOf course, things didn't stop there. To make the story even better (worse?), the bus driver reportedly was stopped by state troopers 30 miles away and was said to have initially refused to stop. \nSo a runaway bus driver, stranded in Western New York, and a loss all in a few hours. A tough night for Saint Louis. Add a comment", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:29:40.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
