Credit: PA \nThe Queen will open a new national centre combating cyber attacks as Britain's top businesses are warned they are not fully prepared to fight the rising threat of hackers. \nHer Majesty will be accompanied by The Duke of Edinburgh and Chancellor Philip Hammond for the opening of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in central London, which is underpinned by £1.9 billion investment . \nThe NCSC, which is part of intelligence agency GCHQ, has already tackled 188 attacks in the past three months. \n\"The cyber attacks we are seeing are increasing in their frequency, their severity, and their sophistication,\" Mr Hammond will say. The Queen returned to London last week after spending Christmas and the New Year in Norfolk. Credit: PA \nAt the weekend it was revealed that Britain's national security is threatened by dozens of cyber attacks every month, while 65% of large businesses reported a cyber breach or attack in the last year. \nThe centre will work with the industry to tighten security but Mr Hammond will call on business to \"sharpen its approach\". 9 in 10 Businesses that the Government says lack an incident management plan in the event of a cyber breach. \n\"Nine out of 10 businesses don't even have an incident management plan in the event of a cyber breach,\" he will say. \nMajor-General Chip Chapman, the Ministry of Defence's former head of counter terrorism, told ITV News the scale of cyber crime is \"phenomenal\" and amounts to an economy of trillions of dollars.

GCHQ will act as a parent body to the new centre in Victoria, central London. Credit: PA \nThe Government will also run a new initiative, Industry 100, which will see 100 temporary places given to private sector staff to work in the centre. \nUnveiling the scheme, Mr Hammond will say the Government \"cannot protect businesses and the general public from the risks of cyber-attack on its own\". \nThe centre's chief executive Ciaran Martin said: \"We will help secure our critical services, lead the response to the most serious incidents and improve the underlying security of the internet through technological improvement and advice to citizens and organisations.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:36:00.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
