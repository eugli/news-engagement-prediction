Audio: Barry Pollock from Sunfish says removing infected prawns from supermarkets is the only way to eliminate white spot risk (ABC News) \nSunfish technical adviser Barry Pollock said a lack of awareness among anglers about the dangers of spreading white spot was putting the environment and aquaculture industry at risk. \n\"The main outlets, mainly the big supermarkets, there is no warnings on the deli counters that the prawns should only be used for human consumption and not for bait,\" Dr Pollock said. \n\"In the frozen food section, the sealed packages of imported prawns do carry the warning. The biggest problem is the prawns in the deli section.\" \nBut Dr Pollock said ultimately the only way to eliminate the risk was to stop the importation and sale of imported raw prawns. \n\"Recreational fishers wouldn't deliberately go and try to spread white spot,\" he said. \n\"At this stage I think education is important because the prawns are still being sold, but our bottom line is this has got to stop. \n\"We don't want these prawns for sale at all in Australia, or in Queensland anyway.\" \nDr Pollock said unless more action was taken, more contaminated prawns would end up in local waterways after being purchased inadvertently and used as bait. \nHe said efforts to communicate concerns had been ignored by the state and federal governments. \nAnd while Sunfish had provided advice to its registered membership of more than 45,000 club, group and individual anglers, it was impossible to reach the broader recreational fishing community. \n\"It's the holiday fishermen or the people who go fishing once or twice a year, they're not being informed of the dangers of white spot,\" Dr Pollock said. \n\"It's been pretty lax to date. There's been very little said to the general recreational fishing community about not using imported raw prawns.\" Closing boat ramps not the answer \nA north Queensland council has taken the unprecedented step of closing a public boat ramp as part of efforts to contain the spread of a devastating prawn virus. \nNorthern prawn farmers are on heightened alert, ramping up their own biosecurity efforts to protect their stock from white spot disease. \nBut this week a sign was erected advising the Marion Creek boat ramp at Ilbilbie, near Mackay, had been closed to all boating, fishing and camping due to biosecurity concerns. \nThe boat ramp is right next door to Matt West's prawn farm. \nMr West, who is the Australian Prawn Farmers Association president, said prawn farmers were shocked the Federal Government had not recalled product from supermarket shelves once the extent of white spot contamination was known. \n\"There's imported prawns still out there at the moment that have white spot in them,\" Mr West said. \n\"So, all it takes is someone going into a retail outlet, picking up some green product to go fishing right next to us, and then all of sudden we've got white spot material coming on the farm. It's that easy,\" Mr West said. \nBut Dr Pollock did not believe widespread closures of boat ramps was necessary, nor would it be supported. \n\"I can understand the concerns and I think it's a reasonable approach at this stage, but it's still only a stop-gap measure,\" he said. \n\"There's still going to be these prawns out there if these supermarkets and retailers continue selling them. It's just really got to stop.\" \nFederal Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce declined to be interviewed by ABC Rural, and Queensland Fisheries did not return calls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T15:42:37.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
