The Austin, Texas-based outfit keeps it simple in the song's new video, cranking through the tune with workman-like efficiency. Related 2017 Country Music Preview: Most Anticipated Albums, Tours and Festivals From new albums by Chris Stapleton, Shania Twain and Sam Hunt to massive country gatherings like Stagecoach and CMA Music Festival \n\"All I'm Asking\" is the opening track from Band of Heathens' new album Duende , which was released in January and produced by Jim Vollentine. The video, shot in black and white, doubles as both performance piece and lyric video, with each player being framed in giant block letters as each line is sung. \"Let's start over, I'll do better / Maybe next time we'll be together,\" Jurdi pleads, his melody evoking the grandeur and sincerity of Phil Spector's work. \nBand of Heathens is currently on tour supporting Duende . Tonight, they're set to kick off a Texas run at the Kessler in Dallas, followed by appearances in Austin, Houston, San Antonio and Fredricksburg.
