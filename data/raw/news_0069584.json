Jamavar of a Saturday night is roaringly busy, both of its floors packed with a Mayfair clientele streaming constantly through the door or loitering under its crimson awning awaiting limos. The staff cope with all of this admirably. If you’re given a choice, choose a table downstairs: it is darker, fashioned from navy leather and silvered oak and altogether cosier. Upstairs is brighter, brassier and decidedly hectic. Also, beware of the loud dance music. I really could do without this in restaurants. I’m sure it makes some diners happy, but I am perilously close to taking secateurs out with me to dismantle sound systems myself. Keep calm and curry on: London's best Indian restaurants \nThe rest of dinner was, all told, rather decent. Grilled adraki lamb chops arrived rare and gloriously rich with royal cumin. And sorry, but I couldn’t resist the Suffolk corn-fed butter chicken; as it whizzed time and again past my eyeline, it was clear it was pleasing the masses — and it sated me with its soft, sweet, decadent loveliness. Yes, I should have ordered the lobster nerulli in southern spiced coconut milk, but sometimes the heart wants what it wants. \nThe sindhi gosht, lamb simmered to soft richness in cinammon and spinach, was wholly satisfying. We ordered a glorious-tasting Peshawari kulcha, which at £5 a throw, was rather hilariously only as big as a child’s palm. \nA fortunate thing to the lack of bulk in Jamavar is that one will have room for pudding. The chilli chikki lava chocolate fondant is extraordinary. The chuski flood with rose petal kulfi haunts my greedy dreams. We left in the midst of a melee of diners hugging the chef. The restaurant doesn’t need me. They’ve got things cracked already.
