PUBLISHED: 18:00, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 | UPDATED: 18:04, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 \nUsing a robotic telescope operated by Liverpool John Moores University, Nasa has discovered SEVEN planets which are similar in size to Earth, rocky and probably have ocean. \nSix of the planets lie in the habitable zone of a cool dwarf-star known as TRAPPIST-1 which is 39 lightyears from Earth. \nThe six habitable planets have a surface temperature ranging from zero to 100 degrees celsius – the temperature region which is perfect for supporting life. \nOf these six, at least three of the planets have an ocean– and scientists state that anywhere on Earth you find water, you are likely to find life, which is why astronomers look for these on other planets.
