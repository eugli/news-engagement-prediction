JUST WATCHED National security adviser: Iran is 'on notice' 02:27 Story highlights Andelman: With all these bridges burned this week, just what political leverage does Trump have to confront Iran with? Without anyone standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Trump, this could be read as a pretty empty threat David A. Andelman, editor emeritus of World Policy Journal and member of the board of contributors of USA Today, is the author of \" A Shattered Peace: Versailles 1919 and the Price We Pay Today .\" Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman . The views expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN) When President Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, arrived unannounced in the White House press room Wednesday and announced that \"we're officially putting Iran on notice\" -- a position the President clearly agrees with, as he made clear in a tweet Thurday morning -- after its latest ballistic missile test and several attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen, the most immediate question was this: or else what? Over the past week, the President has burned a whole lot of his diplomatic capital. Gen. Flynn said the US, or at least he, was particularly upset because Iran was \"threatening friends and allies in the region.\" The bigger question is whether the US really has very many friends and allies in that region or anywhere else. And without anyone standing shoulder-to-shoulder with President Trump, could this be read as a pretty empty threat? US threatens Iran, but what comes next? Let's examine just what kind of room for bluster and challenge this administration might muster. The President could make good on yet another of his campaign promises and \"tear up\" the Iranian nuclear deal. The problem is that this is not simply a pact between the US and Iran, but rather between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (Britain, France, Russia, China, and the US) plus Germany. None of these other countries seems prepared right now to rush with the US into such an impetuous and ill-conceived action. The other possible action the US could take would be to \"snap back\" a broad array of economic sanctions against Iran, the removal of which was the carrot for Tehran to agree to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. Read More With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set to pay Trump a visit at the White House in two weeks and with Israel eager to see the treaty removed and sanctions reinstalled, this could be an appealing move. It's not so attractive to the rest of the world, however. Europe has embraced both the lifting of sanctions and the freeze of the Iranian nuclear program. But at the same time, Europe has also embraced a continuation of another series of sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine and the seizure of Crimea. Due to be renewed in July, President Trump has thus far failed to endorse any renewal. So, the recent step-up in hostilities over the past week by pro-Russian elements in eastern Ukraine could be seen as a test as to whether President Putin might be able to drive a further wedge between Western European leaders and the Trump administration. Instead, there's a broad and growing sense that Trump is becoming the third rail of international diplomacy. What European leader is going to embrace Trump or his ideas if they're only going to get gob-smacked like British Prime Minister Theresa May, who invited the President to visit the Queen, only to see him turn around as soon as she's airborne and come out with his immigration ban? By the time she arrived back in London, following a brief stop in Turkey, some 1.6 million Brits had signed a petition demanding that her invitation on behalf of the Queen be rescinded and Parliament scheduled a debate on the issues for February 20. (To be fair, 114,000 signed another petition supporting Trump.)
