At the very least, the two stars had been approached and the game’s payout had been negotiated. Both were intrigued, with Jordan even teasing the matchup on ESPN after the All-Star break.” \nWhile both players initially were interested, the game never materialized for a host of reasons, including NBA commissioner David Stern’s dislike for associating his league with gambling. \nBut the players also began to waver, especially “His Airness,” who wondered what the game actually would accomplish, David Falk, Jordan’s agent, told Abrams. \n“Falk recalls Jordan saying: ‘If I win, people will say,’So, what do you expect? That’s what Michael is — he’s a one-on-one player.’ And if I lose, then I don’t have the rings or the title. So what’s the point of doing it?” \nWho would have won? We’ll never know, but what a spectacle it would have been. \nThumbnail photo via Jeremy Brevard/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T15:41:22.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
