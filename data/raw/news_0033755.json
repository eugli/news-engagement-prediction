But Monday’s sanctions were imposed under rules passed during the Clinton administration allowing the U.S. to go after the assets of anyone designated a drug kingpin.

Korea missile launch at public dinner \n“This was an overdue step to ratchet up pressure on the Venezuelan regime and signal that top officials will suffer consequences if they continue to engage in massive corruption, abuse human rights and dismantle democracy,” said Mark Feierstein, who served as Obama’s top national security adviser on Latin America. \nThe talks between the opposition and Venezuela have since collapsed. The opposition blames Maduro’s administration, saying it didn’t follow through on a pledge to free dozens of political prisoners or set a date for regional elections after the government suspended a recall referendum against the president in October. \n“The sanctions in and of themselves will not bring about a democratic transition,” Feierstein said. “That will require the Venezuelan opposition to remobilize its followers and U.S. diplomatic efforts to marshal governments in the region to isolate Maduro.” Anti-government activists protested against President Nicolas Maduro's government on the third year anniversary of a student's killing by security forces that kicked off a wave of deadly unrest in 2014. (Fernando Llano/AP) \nTensions between the U.S. and Venezuela have been on the rise for years. The countries haven’t exchanged ambassadors since 2010. \nMissionary in Venezuela on weapons charge stuck for another month \nBut Trump mentioned the country only briefly during the campaign and it wasn’t clear if he signed off on the designation. Senior administration officials would only say anyone who had a need or desire to know was consulted. \nAmid uncertainty on whether Trump would break from the Obama administration’s policy of relative restraint, Maduro had been holding back his normal fiery rhetoric. \nAfter blasting Trump as a “bandit” and “mental patient” during the campaign, Maduro has remained quiet since. \n“He won’t be worse than Obama, that’s the only thing I dare to say,” Maduro said last month in an appeal to supporters to withhold judgment on Trump. \nCanadian man missing since 2012 found wandering in Brazil \nMaduro made no mention of the U.S. decision at an event Monday night alongside a visiting Chinese delegation. \nIn the wake of a travel ban against top Venezuelan officials in 2014, Maduro ordered the U.S. to slash staffing at its embassy in Caracas, accusing diplomats of conspiring to overthrow his government. \nLopez, who was known to shuttle between the U.S. and Venezuela on a privately owned Gulfstream 200 jet that was also blocked by Monday’s actions, controls a network of companies spanning Venezuela, the British Virgin Islands and Panama that did business with the Venezuelan government in the food, logistics and oil industries, the Treasury Department said. \nHe was also listed as recently as 2012 as a major shareholder in Intercontinental Bank, a U.S. financial institution with a single branch in Miami, although that wasn’t among the assets designated by Monday’s action. \nVenezuelan president’s pick for new VP is accused drug trafficker \nSeveral of the U.S. companies list as their address a $2.4 million Miami condo in the trendy Brickell neighborhood with three pools and wraparound ocean views. \nIn his statement, Lopez said he would seek all legal remedies, saying he is not a government official and is being targeted only because of his relationship to El Aissami. \n“The listing is unjustified in targeting a legitimate businessman,” said the statement on a new English-language website that portrays Lopez as an entrepreneur and philanthropist committed to Venezuela’s development.
