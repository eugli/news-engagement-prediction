Source: Q&A/ABC Jacqui Lambie blasts Muslim youth leader on Q&A \nA shouting match between the pair followed a question from a man in the audience who told the panel mass migration of people between continents has meant “people bring with them different cultures, experiences and expectations”. Senator Jacqui Lambie (right) insisted those who supported Sharia Law in Australia should be deported, during Monday night's heated debate about migration, while activist Yassmin Abdel-Magied struggled to remain calm. Picture: Q&A/ABC \n“This mixture of people, some of them oppressed for a long time has put the meaning of democracy in question,\" he said. \n“Is it not the time for democratic leaders of the world to identify and define the rules, so migration doesn’t disturb the peace and harmony of the community?” \nIn response, Lambie acknowledged she was pushing for Australia to follow Donald Trump’s example by deporting all Muslims who followed Sharia Law. \n“Anybody that supports Sharia Law in this country should be deported,” the independent senator affirmed. \nThe crossbench senator last Wednesday renewed her bid to ban the burqa from public places after introducing a new bill to prohibit full face coverings in airports and other Commonwealth jurisdictions. Crossbencher Jacqui Lambie last week introduced a private senators' bill banning people from wearing full-face coverings in Commonwealth jurisdictions.

Picture: Q&A/ABC \nAbdel-Magied, an advocate for women’s empowerment, did not hold back when she insisted “People talk about Islam without knowing anything about it.” \n“And they are willing to completely negate any of my rights as a human being, as a woman, as a person with agency, simply because they have an idea what my faith is about? \n“Islam to me is the most feminist religion. We got equal rights well before the Europeans. We don’t take our husband’s last names because we ain’t their property. We were given the right to own land,” she went on to say. \n“What is culture, is separate than what is faith. And that fact that people go around dissing my faith without knowing anything about it and want to chuck me out of a country.” \nIn response, Lambie cut in saying: “The fact is we have one law in this country and it is the Australian law. It is not Sharia Law. Not in this country, not in my day.” \nIn her defence, Abdel-Magied told the senator “It says in Islam you follow the law of the land that you are on. So don't try to tell me you know anything about my religion.” Yassmin Abdel-Magiedher said the idea of condemning minorities normalised the idea of “othering” which was prominent pre-WWII. Picture: Q&A/ABC \nShe added that normalising the rhetoric Donald Trump uses “frightens” her because it normalises the sense of “othering” prominent during pre-WWII. \n“I am Australian and I have gone around the world talking about how much I love Australia … and so it hurts me deeply when my elected representatives don’t want to have me in this country simply because of my faith or where I was born.” \nIn response, Lambie told her to “stop playing the victim\" insisting \"we've had enough\". \n\"Your ban got lifted, get over it,” Lambie lashed out. \nLambie's push came as Victorian opposition leader Matthew Guy proposed laws to give judges specific powers to demand people to remove face coverings in court. \nWhile he insists it is not a burqa ban, the move is aimed at curbing a \"growing disrespect for our court system\", not discriminating against people who wear face coverings, Guy insisted.
