(CBC News)\nSince the Organ and Tissue Donation Registry was started three years ago, more than 330,000 Albertans have registered to be organ donors, Hoffman said.\nHowever, 600 people are still on waiting lists for organs and thousands more are waiting for tissue transplants.\nAlberta was the first province to directly ask people if they wanted to donate through registry offices.\nAbout 2,500 Albertans sign up every week to become organ and tissue donors, the government said. Fifty-eight per cent of registrants are female; 42 per cent are male.\nOrgan donors saved 380 lives in 2015, an 11-per-cent increase over the 342 transplants done in 2014, the government said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:25:44.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
