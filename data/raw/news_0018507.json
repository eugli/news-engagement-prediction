This could enable the $3.8 billion pipeline to begin operation as soon as June.\nEnergy Transfer Partners is building the 1,170-mile (1,885 km) line to help move crude from the shale oilfields of North Dakota to Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico, where many U.S. refineries are located.\nProtests against the project last year drew drew thousands of people to the North Dakota plains including Native American tribes and environmental activists, and protest camps sprung up. The movement attracted high-profile political and celebrity supporters.\nThe permit was the last bureaucratic hurdle to the pipeline's completion, and Tuesday's decision drew praise from supporters of the project and outrage from activists, including promises of a legal challenge from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.\n\"It's great to see this new administration following through on their promises and letting projects go forward to the benefit of American consumers and workers,\" said John Stoody, spokesman for the Association of Oil Pipe Lines.\nThe Standing Rock Sioux, which contends the pipeline would desecrate sacred sites and potentially pollute its water source,\nvowed to shut pipeline operations down if construction is completed, without elaborating how it would do so. The tribe called on its supporters to protest in Washington on March 10 rather than return to North Dakota.\n\"As Native peoples, we have been knocked down again, but we will get back up,\" the tribe said in the statement. \"We will rise above the greed and corruption that has plagued our peoples since first contact. We call on the Native Nations of the United States to stand together, unite and fight back.\"\nFormer President Barack Obama's administration last year delayed completion of the pipeline pending a review of tribal concerns and in December ordered an environmental study.\nLess than two weeks after Trump ordered a review of the permit request, the Army said in a filing in District Court in Washington D.C. it would cancel that study. The final permit, known as an easement, could come in as little as a day, according to the filing.\nThere was no need for the environmental study as there was already enough information on the potential impact of the pipeline to grant the permit, Robert Speer, acting secretary of the U.S. Army, said in a statement.\nTrump issued an order on Jan. 24 to expedite both the Dakota Access Pipeline and to revive another controversial multibillion dollar oil artery: Keystone XL. Obama's administration blocked that project in 2015.\nAt the Dakota Access construction site, law enforcement and protesters clashed violently on several occasions throughout the fall. More than 600 people were arrested, and police were criticized for using water cannons in 25-degree Fahrenheit (minus 4-degree Celsius) weather against activists in late November.\n\"The granting of an easement, without any environmental review or tribal consultation, is not the end of this fight,\" said Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, one of the primary groups protesting the line.\n\"It is the new beginning. Expect mass resistance far beyond what Trump has seen so far.\"\n© REUTERS/Terray Sylvester A North Dakota National Guard vehicle idles on the outskirts of the Dakota Access oil pipeline protest camp near Cannon Ball LEGAL CHALLENGE TOUGH\nAny legal challenge is likely to be a difficult one for pipeline opponents as presidential authority to grant such permits is generally accepted in the courts. The tribe said in a statement the decision \"wrongfully terminated\" environmental study of the project.\nDeborah Sivas, professor of environmental law at Stanford and director of Stanford's Environmental Law Clinic, said a challenge by the tribe would likely rely on the reasons the Army Corps itself gave for why more review was needed in December.\n\"The tribe will probably argue that an abrupt reversal without a sufficient explanation for why the additional analysis is not necessary is arbitrary and should, therefore, be set aside,\" she said in an email.\nSupporters say the pipeline is safer than rail or trucks to transport the oil.\nShares of Energy Transfer Partners finished up 20 cents at $39.20, reversing earlier losses on the news.\n(Additional reporting by Liz Hampton in HOUSTON and Brendan Pierson in New York; Writing by David Gaffen and Simon Webb; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA9UODq.img", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmI0xb?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmI0xb?blobrefkey=103&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1024&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;576&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/9b2eb827-", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmI0xb%3focid%3dsl&title=Army+Will+Allow+Completion+Of+DAPL&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmI0xb%3focid%3dsl", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA3dTgi.img", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmI0xb%3focid%3dst&text=Army+Will+Allow+Completion+Of+DAPL&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmI0xb%3focid%3dst", "http://api.wochit.com/api/?partnerID=f421a246974545c6e1fb724595053584efa8cc05492e9685c8c2ea4e90f3768d&action=MRSS&topicName=General&descendants=true&quot;}", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmI0xb?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmI0xb?blobrefkey=104&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1280&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;720&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmHVmC.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Army", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmI0xb&lang=en-us&flow_id=8eac2178-a73f-4902-b726-ca484f1e457f", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBnMzWD.img", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/9b2eb827-3625-416a-95c1-88658ed12eb8/fecff662-e0cf-481c-b652-1e5964a19a0a.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmI0xb?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}"], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:47:16.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
