Many have filled-in over the years, though no one will ever truly replace the flamboyant, iconic frontman of Queen . Apparently James Corden wasn’t paying attention. \nQueen has just announced a summer tour of North America with American Idol alum Adam Lambert again taking lead vocal duties. Corden figures he deserves a chance. \"In my head growing up I always thought I’d make a great frontman for Queen,\" the funnyman recounted overnight on The Late Late Show . \nAdam Lambert is alright, he conceded. But the heir to Freddie's throne should be a Brit. Someone like Corden. Enter Lambert to prove him wrong. \nThe pair went into battle -- a sing-off battle -- to decide who would be a better frontman. Original guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor joined in as Lambert tackled \"We Will Rock You,\" then Corden got to work on “Don’t Stop Me Know.” And the hits just kept rolling. \nQueen and Adam Lambert hit the road for a 25-city arena tour beginning on June 23 in Phoenix, Arizona at the Gila River Arena. \nWatch Corden and Lambert’s “front man battle” below. * @adamlambert high note voice *", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T12:08:16.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
