TNN | Updated: Feb 11, 2017, 12.10 PM IST Bangladesh had a tough time dealing with Umesh Yadav's fiery spell. (AP photo) NEW DELHI: If after two days of being toyed by the Indian batsmen Bangladesh thought now was their turn to make amends with the bat, so far that objective hasn't quite progressed as well as they'd have expected. Bangladesh's hopes of posting a strong total in response to India's massive 687/6 decl. suffered a major setback with India reducing them to 125/4 at lunch on Day 3 of the one-off Test in Hyderabad. Having lost Tamim Iqbal off Mominul Haque in the gap of 20 runs, Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah seemed to be providing assistance, before Ishant Sharma produced a length-ball that moved in slightly off the pitch. Mahmudullah played down the wrong line and was given out. A referral couldn't save him and Bangladesh were four down. And this was when R Ashwin wasn't even handed the ball. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Umesh Yadav made the 14-over-old ball move as if it was brand new. Bhuvneshwar applied the early squeeze and the pressure mounted. Third over of the day, Bangladesh lost Tamim Iqbal to a run-out to a horrible piece of miscommunication between the two batsmen. Returning for a second run, that was never there, Bhuvneshwar picked up a clean throw and didn't miss the stumps. Umesh operated on a probing line, regularly firing in at over 140. Bangladesh had a tough time and it was evident with Shakib looking all over the place against Umesh's reverse swing. One of the good-length balls that straightened after pitching caught Mominul in front of the stumps. It looked so convincing that the batsman didn't even feel like referring. That was just the beginning. Seldom has Umesh bowled in rhythm, and today he showed just how unplayable he can be when he does. Shakib was given a trying time by Umesh, but he stood his ground. He punished the loose ones outside off and swept Ravindra Jadeja towards the mid-wicket boundary in the company of Mahmudullah. The two took Bangladesh over the 100-run mark and did well to see off Umesh's movement and Jadeja's spin. But it took just one over from Ishant to end their resistance. With the wicket, India introduced Ashwin from the other. Result: Bangladesh went four overs without scoring. India lost both their reviews. The first one when Virat Kohli referred a ball that seemingly seemed to be missing Mahmudullah's leg stump and then when Ashwin went up for a leg before shout to Shakib. Brief Scores: Bangladesh 125/4 (Shakib Al Hasan 29*, Mahmudullah 28; Umesh Yadav 2/32) trail India 687/6 decl. by 562 runs  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:59:09.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
