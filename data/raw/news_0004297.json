Of interest to us are the results of Sony Mobile Communications: the division posted an operating profit of $187 million (21.2 billion Japanese yen) and reported total sales of $2.2 billion (248.6 billion yen). 5.1 million Xperia smartphones were sold in Q4 2016 - 2.5 million fewer units compared to the same quarter of 2015. Sony says that it's been impacted by the reduction of handset sales \"mainly in Europe\", but also in \"unprofitable regions.\"Overall, Sony Mobile sold 15 million smartphones throughout 2016. That's the lowest number of handsets sold in a full year since 2012, when Sony Mobile was established (after Sony bought Ericsson's share in Sony Ericsson). Still, we're pretty sure that Sony is actually glad to sell fewer smartphones as long as it's not losing money.
