Truth be told, the Nokia 6 was originally announced back in January, and this is essentially its global launch, but the other two Nokia smartphones had been introduced today for the first time ever. Having that in mind, we already talked about all of these smartphones, but did not have their full spec sheets for the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 back then. Well, now we do, so, let’s take a look at the specs of these three smartphones, along with the Nokia 6, shall we. \nThe Nokia 3 is first in line. This smartphone sports a 5-inch 720p (1280 x 720) display with a 2.5D curved glass on top of it, along with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. The device is fueled by MediaTek’s MT6737 64-bit quad-core processor, and a 2,650mAh battery is also included here, and it is not removable. An 8-megapixel snapper (1.12um pixel size, f/2.0 aperture) is placed on the back of this smartphone, and an 8-megapixel camera (1.12um pixel size, 84-degree wide-angle lens) can also be found on the device’s front side. Android 7.0 Nougat comes pre-installed on the Nokia 3, and the device comes in Silver White, Matte Black, Tempered Blue and Copper White color variants. The Nokia 3 offers Cat. 4 4G LTE connectivity, and ships with a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone measures 143.4 x 71.4 x 8.48mm, while we don’t know how much it weighs just yet. \nThe Nokia 5 sport a 5.2-inch 720p (1280 x 720) IPS LCD display with a 2.5D curved glass on top of it, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. This phone is fueled by the Snapdragon 430 64-bit octa-core SoC, and a 3.5mm headphone jack is included here as well. A 13-megapixel shooter (1.12um pixel size, f/2.0 aperture, PDAF) is placed on the back of this phone, and so is the dual-LED, dual-tone flash. An 8-megapixel snapper (1.12um pixel size, f/2.0 aperture, 84-degree wide-angle lens) is located on the front side of the Nokia 5, and a 3,000mAh non-removable battery is also included here. This phone comes with only one speaker, but it has a smart amplifier (TFA9891). Android 7.1.1 Nougat is pre-installed here, and Cat. 4 LTE is available as far as mobile connectivity is concerned. The Nokia 5 comes in Tempered Blue, Silver, Matte Black and Copper color options. This phone measures 149.7 x 72.5 x 8.05mm, though we don’t know its weight yet. \nThe Nokia 6 is the most powerful out of the bunch. A 5.5-inch fullHD (1920 x 1080) panel is placed on the front side of this phone, and an 8-megapixel shooter lies above it. A fingerprint scanner is placed below the display, and this phone also packs in 3GB / 4GB of RAM and 32GB / 64GB of native storage. The Snapdragon 430 64-bit octa-core SoC fuels this smartphone, and a 3,000mAh non-removable battery is also included in this package. A 16-megapixel shooter (f/2.0 aperture) lies on the back of this phone, and Android 7.1.1 Nougat comes pre-installed here. The device comes in Matte Black, Tempered Blue, Silver, Copper and Arte Black color variants, though the last option is reserved for the 4GB RAM variant of the Nokia 6, and that’s the only color option that variant of the phone ships in. The Nokia 6 measures 154 x 75.8 x 8.4mm, while it weighs 169 grams. \nNokia 3:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T21:32:18.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
