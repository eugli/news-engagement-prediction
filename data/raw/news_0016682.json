He grabbed it out of my hand,' she said.\n'He was just trying to help but our cars got separated. Apparently, Kelly looked over, and she was like, \"Wait a minute—is that Scarlett's breast pump? We've got to get it back!\" because she knew how panicked I would be.\nNot the highest paid: In her interview Scarlett also addressed inequality in Hollywood\n'We finally ended up at the same party three hours later, and Mark was like, \"I'm so sorry.\"'\nScarlett's daughter Rose is now two. It was announced last month that the actress had split from her daughter's father, Romain Dauriac, last summer.\nIn her interview Scarlett also addressed inequality in Hollywood.\n'It's liquid gold!' Scarlett had a five-month-old daughter when she attended the 2015 Oscars\nDespite being the highest-grossing actress in the industry, she still finds herself struggling against discrimination, she revealed.\n'Some people felt I should talk about my personal struggle in order to shed a spotlight on the greater issue,' she said.\n'Maybe I’m being presumptuous, but I assumed it was obvious that women in all positions struggle for equality. It’s always an uphill battle and fight.\nTrying to help: Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos took the pump to the Oscars for Scarlett, but ended up accidentally taking it to a party\n'My experience with my close female friends and family is that the struggle is real for everybody. Everyone has been discriminated against or harassed - sexism is real.'\nAnd the 32-year-old said she had to fight to get equal pay, just like any other woman. 'Just because I’m the top-grossing actress of all time does not mean I’m the highest paid,.\n'I’ve had to fight for everything that I have. It’s such a fickle and political industry.'\nScarlett, whose twin brother Hunter worked for Barack Obama during his 2008 campaign, also talked about celebrities getting involved in politics.\n'[I believe] that it is really important to hear people in various positions of power voice their opinions, their story,' she said.\n'Why can't I have the voice? Why can't I use my platform? What's the point of having it if you don't use it?'\nCover girl: Scarlett's issue hits hits newsstands on February 14", "external_links": ["http://f.mol.im/i/furniture/fff/fff-logo-lowercase.png", "http://f.mol.im/i/furniture/fff/hub_link.png", "http://f.mol.im/i/furniture/fff/hot-picks.png", "http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a25191/scarlett-johansson-march-2017-cover/", "http://f.mol.im/i/furniture/fff/preload-inline.gif", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "http://f.mol.im/i/furniture/fff/transparent.png", "http://f.mol.im/i/furniture/fff/sash_bargain.png", "http://f.mol.im/i/furniture/fff/missing_product_image.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-06T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:19:49.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
