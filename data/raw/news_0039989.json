Because there are lots of problems which are of a sort that neither the United States nor Russia can solve them effectively alone.\" \nPeskov was responding to a question about a possible U.S. probe into the resignation of President Donald Trump's national security adviser - the latest in a series of White House missteps and controversies. \nHe said he was unaware of the calls for an inquiry and it was an internal matter for the United States. \n(Reporting by Alessandra Prentice; Editing by Jack Stubbs) Read the original article on Reuters .
