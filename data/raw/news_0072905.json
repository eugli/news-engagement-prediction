'He’s always been there for them, this award is for all the kooks and all the people that make the kooks.' Bowie also won the award for Best British Male which was picked up by actor Michael C Hall, who quipped that Bowie wouldn't have attended the BRITs even if he was alive. Speaking about the icon, Michael - who starred in Bowie's Lazarus musical said: 'If David Bowie could be here tonight, he probably wouldn't be here tonight. 'But I am here tonight on behalf of his family to accept this testament to a man beholden to nothing but his own imagination.' Michael went on to praise David, saying: 'His vitality soothes us and I'm honoured to stand before you and celebrate his work. David's kindness, generosity and enthusiasm will inspire me to be a better man.' Bowie's Best British Male win will have come as no surprise to Craig David, who previously admitted that there was 'no competition' between the late star and the other nominees. 'David Bowie's career has been so epic,' he told BBC News . 'He influenced me and so many other artists. There's no competition.' Also scooping an award on the night was Emeli Sande who won Best British Female Solo Artist, beating off stiff competition from Anonhni, Ellie Goulding Lianne La Havas and Nao. Humbly accepting the gong, the Read All About It hitmaker said: 'Thank you to the creator of all things. This is my sister Lucy Sande, this award is for you, thank you so much.' Emotional: The award was picked up by Michael C Hall, who gushed: 'Standing before you and acknowledging the potency of his work and also acknowledging David’s kindness, generosity and enthusiasm will always inspire me to be a better man' Picking up Best British Group was The 1975 - who fought off Bastille, Biffy Clyro , Little Mix and Radiohead for the honour. Frontman Matt Healy said: This is mental. We’ve been the same line up since we were 13, this kind of thing doesn’t really happen. I think the reason we are here is because of of our album. 'We tried to get back to the place we were when we were 14. When you have a platform a lot of people say stay in your lane when it comes to social issues but don’t do that, please don’t do that.'

I think the reason we are here is because of of our album Emma Willis and Dermot O'Leary present the show after being drafted in when Michael Buble was forced to pull out due to his son's battle with cancer. 'The BRITs is an iconic show that I've watched and attended many times,' said Dermot about his hosting duties. 'It's a holy grail for a broadcaster, and I'm really looking forward to working with Emma, who I'm a big fan of, and celebrating a brilliant year of British music.' 'To present the BRITs is an honour but to be doing it alongside one of my absolute favourites, Mr Dermot O'Leary is just bonkers. Bring on the BRITs 2017,' added Emma. Read All About It: Also scooping an award on the night was Emeli Sande who won Best British Female Solo Artist, beating off stiff competition from Anonhni, Ellie Goulding Lianne La Havas and Nao Little Mix and Grime artist Skepta lead the nominations pack with three apiece - with many critics wondering if the North London-born MC can replicate his prestigious Mercury Music Prize win and scoop the British Album of The Year prize for Konnichiwa. Little Mix - and bandmember Perrie Edwards - have a battle of their own, with Perrie's ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik both nominated for Best British single - Zayn for R&B style Pillowtalk and Little Mix for their hit Shout Out To My Ex, which fans believe is partly written about the former One Direction star. Interestingly, Beyonce goes against sister Solange for the Best International Female gong, although they both face stiff competition from rising star Christine And The Queens, Rihanna and Sia. Solange, who considers Beyonce a role model, released her album A Seat At The Table just three days before her thirtieth birthday last year, to critical acclaim. It became her first number-one album in the US, making she and Beyonce the first sisters to have US number-one albums in a calendar year. Adele will be hoping to replicate a tiny slice of her recent Grammy success by scooping the British Artist Video Of The Year award for Send My Love (To Your New Lover). However, she faces a tough contest with Calvin Harris Feat. Rihanna, whose video for This Is What You Came For has been a frontrunner with the bookies. Blues Singer Rag 'N' Bone Man has already secured his first BRIT, scooping the Critics Choice gong - one of two awards already announced. The award - given to artists tipped for the top - is held in high regard, having previously been presented to Adele, Sam Smith and Florence + The Machine. 'I thought they had made a mistake. I was up against two pop giants. It’s bloody brilliant! I'm crazy happy. Proper massive grin,' he said about his win when it was announced last year. And Robbie Williams will accept the BRITs Icon Award - which provides him with his 18th BRIT award win, either as a solo artist or member of Take That. The singer seemed a little bemused at being selected to receive the prestigious prize, which sees him follow in the footsteps of Elton John and David Bowie. 'There’s so much in my career where I look into the abyss and the abyss looks back and goes: \"I don’t know, I don’t have a f**king clue,\"' he recently told NME . 'How have I got 18 BRITs and Paul McCartney hasn’t? Something weird has happened... Me having 18 BRITs – it’s like there’s a glitch in the Matrix. But, you know I’m not going to give them back and I’m glad it’s happened to me.'
