The change comes as a reversal of former President Obama’s landmark protection initiative, which was a huge step forward for the entire transgender community. As LGBTQ+ people have feared, the Trump presidency is already pushed some of their hard-fought progress a couple steps back. \nIt is worth noting that apparently the decision caused some disputes within Trump’s administration, as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was allegedly not down with the idea of leaving transgender students unprotected in schools. Ultimately, she bowed down to Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and agreed to reverse Obama’s order. Sean Spicer later refuted the idea that there was any disagreement within Trump’s cabinet about the issue, because as we all know it’s “running like a fine-tuned machine” . It’s great to know that even if there are unlikely allies in the Trump administration standing up for LGBTQ+ rights that they will be given the ultimatum of conceding or being fired. Sigh. \nThe decision has, obviously, caused an uproar within the LGBTQ+ community. And let’s be honest, it’s really fucking disheartening to think that children across the country now have to fight just to be who they are. Like high school wasn’t hard enough already. \nYouTuber and trans rights activist Aydian Dowling has a message of hope for trans people across the world in the wake of the transgender bathroom guidelines reversal. He wants you to know that “You are enough” just as you are right now. Check it out below.
