I’ll let you know why in a moment. \nTrump also used the occasion to tout his “America First” economics , stating “our goal as a nation must be to rely less on imports and more on products made here in the U.S.A.” and “we want products made by our workers in our factories stamped by those four magnificent words, ‘Made in the U.S.A.’” \nTo achieve this goal Trump would impose “a very substantial penalty” on companies that fired their workers and moved to another country to make a product, and then tried to sell it back to America. \nThe carrot would be lower taxes and fewer regulations “that send our jobs to those other countries.” \nTrump seems utterly ignorant about global competition – and about what’s really holding back American workers. \nStart with Boeing’s Dreamliner itself. It’s not “made in the U.S.A..” It’s assembled in the United States. But most of it parts come from overseas. Those foreign parts total almost a third of the cost of the entire plane. \nFor example: \nThe Italian firm Alenia Aeronautica makes the center fuselage and horizontal stabilizers. \nThe French firm Messier-Dowty makes the aircraft’s landing gears and doors. \nThe German firm Diehl Luftfahrt Elektronik supplies the main cabin lighting. \nThe Swedish firm Saab Aerostructures makes the cargo access doors. \nThe Japanese company Jamco makes parts for the lavatories, flight deck interiors and galleys. \nThe French firm Thales makes its electrical power conversion system. \nThales selected GS Yuasa, a Japanese firm, in 2005 to supply it with the system’s lithium-ion batteries. \nThe British company Rolls Royce makes many of the engines. \nA Canadian firm makes the moveable trailing edge of the wings. \nNotably, these companies don’t pay their workers low wages. In fact, when you add in the value of health and pension benefits – either directly from these companies to their workers, or in the form of public benefits to which the companies contribute – most of these foreign workers get a better deal than do Boeing’s workers. (The average wage for Boeing production and maintenance workers in South Carolina is $20.59 per hour, or $42,827 a year. ) They also get more paid vacation days. \nThese nations also provide most young people with excellent educations and technical training. They continuously upgrade the skills of their workers. And they offer universally-available health care . \nTo pay for all this, these countries also impose higher tax rates on their corporations and wealthy individuals than does the United States. And their health, safety, environmental, and labor regulations are stricter. \nNot incidentally, they have stronger unions . \nSo why is so much of Boeing’s Dreamliner coming from these high-wage, high-tax, high-cost places? \nBecause the parts made by workers in these countries are better, last longer, and are more reliable than parts made anywhere else. \nThere’s a lesson here. \nThe way to make the American workforce more competitive isn’t to put economic walls around America. It’s to invest more and invest better in the education and skills of Americans, in on-the-job training, in a healthcare system that reaches more of us and makes sure we stay healthy. And to give workers a say in their companies through strong unions. \nIn other words, we get a first-class workforce by investing in the productive capacities of Americans – and rewarding them with high wages. \nIt’s the exact opposite of what Trump is proposing. \nBy the way, the first delivery of the Dreamliner is scheduled to take place next year – to Singapore Airlines. Current orders for it include Air France, British Airways, and Mexico’s flag carrier, Aeromexico. \nBoeing is also looking to China to buy as much as $1 trillion worth of its commercial airplanes over the next two decades, including wide-body jets like the 787 Dreamliner. China already accounts for a fifth of Boeing’s sales. \nBut if Trump succeeds in putting an economic wall around America, these other nation’s airlines may have second thoughts about buying from Boeing. They might choose an airplane from a country more open to their own exports – say, Europe’s Airbus. \nTrump’s “America First” economics is pure demagoguery. Xenophobic grandstanding doesn’t boost the competitiveness of American workers. Nor does it boost American-based companies. \nAt most, it boosts Trump. \nRobert Reich, one of the nation’s leading experts on work and the economy, is Chancellor’s Professor of Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley.
