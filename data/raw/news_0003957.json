ADVERTISEMENT \nLawyer Froilan Lawilao, head of administration of Benguet Corp.’s operations in Itogon, said converting a portion of the Antamok mine into a Minahang Bayan was part of the company’s mine rehabilitation plan. \nHe said the company intended to have the Minahang Bayan share the area with an engineered sanitary landfill where it proposed to put up a waste-to-energy facility. \n“We have submitted our mine rehabilitation plan before the secretary’s pronouncement and we are waiting for the decision of the Mines and Geosciences Bureau as to whether the plan was acceptable,” Lawilao said. \nLopez flew aboard a Philippine Air Force helicopter on Friday to inspect the Liang River, which was polluted with mine waste attributed to leaks from a tailing pond. \nShe later met with members of the Loakan-Itogon Pocket Miners Association and Antamok-Loakan Miners Association. \nVergel Aniceto of the Itogon Inter-Barangay Alliance said Lopez was “amazed that even farmers engaged in small-scale mining.” \nOnly conditions \nLomino Kaniteng, president of the Benguet Small-Scale Mining Federation, said Lopez’s only conditions were for the miners to create their own tailing pond and to work using traditional mining instruments. \nHe said several applications for Minahang Bayan in Benguet had been filed since 2004 but these had not been processed by government regulators. \nIn August last year, Lopez stopped all small-scale mining operations outside the designated Minahang Bayan. Only five Minahang Bayan sites operate in the provinces of Quezon, Agusan del Sur, Davao Oriental, Eastern Samar and Dinagat Island. \nFay Apil, MGB Cordillera director, said the agency had been instructed to process the Minahang Bayan application in Benguet. \nShe asked the applicants to secure the prior and informed consent of the indigenous community or their certification allowing the conversion of the area into a pocket mining site. \nIn 2004, a Minahang Bayan was proposed for Bakun town in Benguet but the application was never resolved by the provincial mining regulatory board.—REPORTS FROM VINCENT CABREZA AND KIMBERLIE QUITASOL", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:29:25.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
