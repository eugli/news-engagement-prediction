Victoria hit hard by crisis Dairy companies forecasted a milk exporting bonanza. But as the industry soured, many failed to deliver their promises. \nDairy Australia senior analyst John Droppert said the key dairy region of northern Victoria had borne the brunt of the dairy crisis. \n\"They're down around 18 per cent in total volume terms, which is a pretty big volume of milk,\" he said. \nThe drop in milk production also makes it difficult for milk processors to keep an adequate throughput of raw milk into their factories. \n\"Less milk inevitably means there is less product available to capitalise on a rising market,\" Mr Droppert said. \n\"That's a problem for processors and ultimately it's a problem for farmers.\" \nMr Droppert believes the tension over milk supply makes processors compete harder in the price they pay farmers for milk. External Link: Dairy milk production graph Consumers drinking more milk \nBut some numbers are rising â€” while the nation's dairy farmers are producing less, Australians are drinking more milk. \nIn response to the dairy crisis, Australians have started to buy more dairy. \nTotal milk sales grew in Australia by 2.4 per cent over the 12 months to January. \nMr Droppert said Australians were turning to full cream milk over lower fat varieties. \n\"We've seen a big shift, in the region of 9 per cent growth to full cream milk,\" he said. \n\"You've got to remember this is a mature category so growing at 9 per cent is a pretty significant shift.\" Strong growth in branded products \nAustralians' taste for branded dairy products has also continued since the dairy crisis began in April. \nAt that time Australians largely stopped buying private label $1 per litre supermarket milk and turned to branded products. \nBranded product sales suddenly grew from a record low market share of 34 per cent to more than 48 per cent of the market. \nMr Droppert said the trend had continued, but was not as strong. \n\"It's sitting at around 43 per cent at the moment, so it has held on to most of its gains,\" he said.
