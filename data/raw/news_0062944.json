Not only does the trailer hit you hard and gives you a reality check, but it also makes you connect with the film. For those of you not in the know, the movie revolves around Anaarkali, (Swara) from Aarah (Bihar). She sings, dances and makes a living out of it on a day-to-day basis. But things take an ugly turn when Anaarkali has a confrontation with a very powerful man and instead of bowing down, chooses to fight back. \nWhen VC ( Sanjay Mishra ) tries to touch her inappropriately and flirt with her at a function, Anaarkali slaps him. The guy starts torturing her, but the police don’t help her as she is merely a small-town singer while he is a rich, powerful man. But Anaarkali doesn’t lose hope. She fights back even though his trusted buddy Rangeela (Pankaj Tripathi) doubts her. She troubles VC while hiding from everyone else. Her story and journey is inspiring indeed and we have to say that it really makes you speak up against culprits in real life too. But will Anaarkali get justice? Well, you will have to see the movie to know. Till then, check out the trailer right here: \nVisually, we feel that the movie will be a fun watch. In fact, Swara and Sanjay’s performance will be worth a watch. From the trailer, we can make out that the actress has worked hard on the dialect used in the region and we are sure that this film will work wonders in the north of India. Her performance seems very real and we can’t wait to watch this movie. The songs and background score are average and while not everyone will like it, they won’t be able to ignore it either.
