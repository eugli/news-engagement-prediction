By Mike Chambers | | The Denver Post PUBLISHED: February 11, 2017 at 9:32 pm | UPDATED: Broncos free agency preview: Expect a busy offseason with a changing roster \nCOLORADO SPRINGS — In half as many games, Denver’s NCAA hockey team is bound to produce more wins this season than the city’s NHL club. While that’s a knock on the Avalanche, it’s also high praise for the University of Denver Pioneers. \nDU is rolling. To wit: Saturday’s 5-1 triumph over Colorado College at the Broadmoor World Arena was DU’s 20th of the season, coming an hour after Union College became the first of the 60 NCAA teams to reach 20 wins. The No. 2-ranked Pioneers (20-6-4), who edged the Tigers 2-1 in Denver on Friday, extended their NCAA record of consecutive 20-win seasons to 16. Denver increased its winning streak over CC to 12, sweeping the last three seasons. All but assured of making their 10th consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance, the Pioneers now lead the National Collegiate Hockey Conference with six regular-season games remaining. They will chase NCHC championships (regular season and tournament) before gunning for a second consecutive NCAA Frozen Four berth, this year at the United Center in Chicago. \nSenior Evan Janssen led DU with a goal and an assist in the annual Gold Pan series finale and three freshmen and a sophomore had the other goals. Freshmen Michael Davies (power play) and Tyson McLellan scored in the first period and Janssen and freshman Henrik Borgstrom scored in the second. Sophomore Colin Staub, a Colorado Springs native, scored at 18:28 of the third. Also, freshman Liam Finlay had two assists.
