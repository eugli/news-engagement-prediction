One new chipset from Qualcomm could help fill that gap.\nThe QCA4020 chipset packs in Bluetooth Low Energy 5, ZigBee 3.0, WiFi 802.11n, and OpenThread wireless communications protocols.\nThe chipset is like a mini-developer board -- an integrated chipset with an ARM-based CPU. It can be used to create smart home or industrial devices.\nIt can also serve as a wireless access point for Raspberry Pi and other developer boards used to make smart gadgets, drones, robots, and industrial devices. It has a number of connector protocols and can work with Arduino boards.\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:35:59.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
