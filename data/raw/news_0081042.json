By: FE Online | Published:  26 PM Trump had promised to defeat the ISIS within 30 days of his administration and had spoken about a secret plan to defeat the Islamic extremists. (Reuters) \nUS President Donald Trump’s promise to tackle the ISIS might be coming true. According to reports, the Pentagon has presented the White House with new battle plans to take down the Islamic terrorist organisation following the Trump government’s directive to figure out additional ways to take down the organisation. Donald Trump’s election campaign had focussed mostly on the issue of Islamic terrorism and criticising Barack Obama ’s government for failing to deal with it effectively. Trump had promised to defeat the ISIS within 30 days of his administration and had spoken about a secret plan to defeat the Islamic extremists. Trump had even gone on to promise to “bomb the hell” out of them. He had even threatened to kill the family members of the suspected ISIS members. \nAccording to a report by Dailymail, Donald Trump, shortly after taking the Oval Office had instructed the Pentagon to develop and review a proper plan to eliminate the ISIS in 30 days. Reports say that the first draft of the review was complete and US defence Secretary Jim Mattis had presented the report to the President’s national security advisors. Pentagon spokesperson Navy Captain Jeff Davis said that the plan was about a rapid defeat of the ISIS. These reports may suggest the possibility of US sending more troops to the Middle East. \nAlso watch: \nAccording to the report, only about 500 US troops remain in Syria, working mostly special operations training local Kurdish and Syrian Arab fighters, something which was the doing of former US President, Barack Obama, since he had come to power in 2008 on the promises of ending US conflicts in the middle east. The fight is expected to be a little more complex in the civil war affected Syria. One of the major questions is if the USA would arm Syrian Kurdish forces to take the fight to win Raqa. This move will undoubtedly enrage Turkey which has considered Kurdish fighters as terrorists.
