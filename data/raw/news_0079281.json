As a result, Wright is questionable for Opening Day. David Wright is in New York. He has a right shoulder impingement and won't throw for \"a couple weeks.\" Opening Day \"questionable.\" #Mets \n— Anthony DiComo (@AnthonyDiComo) February 28, 2017 Wright has been sent to NYC. Impingement in right shoulder. Can't throw. No structural damage. No surgery. But can't throw. \n— Matt Ehalt (@MattEhalt) February 28, 2017 \nWright, 34, played in only 37 games in 2016 and just 38 games in 2015, and was working his way back from season-ending neck surgery last June. According to MLB.com , doctors believe the shoulder impingement is related to that surgery. \nThe good news for New York is that it has plenty of infield depth, with Jose Reyes the next man up at the hot corner and Wilmer Flores also available. But it’s troubling news for a team that dealt with a plethora of injuries last season – both in the lineup and rotation – en route to winning a wild card.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:29:34.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
