Each has an affiliation with the Royal Ballet or New York City Ballet or both, is producing work at a fairly rapid rate and seems committed to keeping ballet relevant and accessible. \nAlmost all of the anticipation on this program surrounds the Chicago premiere of Peck's \"Year of the Rabbit,\" although Joffrey's artistic director Ashley Wheater has a keen curatorial eye, filling out the evening with two works from the company's rep that I, for one, was delighted to see again. \nWheeldon's \"Fool's Paradise\" was created nearly a decade ago in the U.K. Joffrey premiered it fall of 2015, and it fits the company like a glove. The curtain opens on a gently rising haze illuminated by a singular down pool of light. The scene triangulates two men and a woman wearing silky flesh tones. Joby Talbot's delicate score and a soft mist of petals falling upstage complement Wheeldon's exacting choreography, which if not for the beautiful decor would look stark and uninviting. \"Fool's Paradise\" lives up to its name, and also to Wheeldon's creed as the former resident choreographer for New York City Ballet (a post now held by Peck). It's a mesmerizing but mostly meaningless dance that often employs its cast of nine in shape-making, conjuring images that hark back to classic architectural moments from George Balanchine's \"Apollo.\" \nMcGregor's \"INFRA\" provides a bit more context; created for the Royal Ballet as a response to the 2005 London subway bombings, its monochromatic haze is harshly illuminated by a stage-width LED screen hanging above the dancer's heads. Bright images of robotic businesspeople pass left to right on the screen, like a pedestrian crossing sign. Sounds of trains braking laid over a haunting Max Richter score lend meaning to the dancers' undulated musings. Each liquefied body roll is book-ended by a sharp nod of the head, a whack of the leg, an exaggerated thrust of the pelvis. \"INFRA's\" partnerships are short-lived; interactions are tender, but generally unsentimental. In the piece's most striking moment, every single company member Joffrey could muster filled the stage, walking unaffected left to right in plain clothes as dancer Amanda Assucena collapsed, sobbing, at center. The dance feels like a requiem for routine, a memorial for the mundane, showing Londoners who once took advantage of a typical Thursday commute and were all of a sudden struck by complete chaos. \nClosing the evening is Peck's brightly colored \"Year of the Rabbit,\" premiered in 2012 by NYCB but new to the Joffrey for this program. Peck takes liberties with his subject matter by rearranging, skipping or in one case inventing a zodiac sign. In the latter case the gorgeous, sensitive, sobering pas de deux , \"Year of our Lord,\" is second to last among a total of seven Sufjan Stevens songs channeling otherwise familiar animals from the Chinese zodiac. It's a needed diversion from the work's six other sections, which stick mainly to large groups. \nNothing about \"Year of the Rabbit\" feels overtly (stereotypically?) Chinese, except perhaps two instances of dramatic, angular shapes performed in silhouette against a bright red backdrop. The rest of the dance is bathed in teal, matching the two-toned simple costumes, and while a few of the variations hint at some drama or narrative, the dance is largely restricted to jubilant, joyful naivete by stringing crisp passes of dancing together with coy smiles and a few cheeky choreographic choices â€” for example, when corps de ballet frames Jeraldine Mendoza and Dylan Gutierrez by lounging on their backs, head in hands, staring up as though cloud-gazing at a picnic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:05:20.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
