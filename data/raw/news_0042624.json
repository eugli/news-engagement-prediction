Definitely proud of the team, though,” coach Jean-Yves Roy said with a smile after his squad improved to 17-0-1.\n“That was a big test for us today. We dug a pretty deep hole for ourselves, and to come back from a three-goal deficit against a team like that, I think that shows something about our team.”\nGet Varsity News in your inbox: Your weekly look at the top high school sports stories. Sophomore Elizabeth Phalen scored twice and senior Elizabeth Hernberg also struck for two as the second-ranked Rockets (19-0-1) built a 4-1 lead midway through the second period.\n“I would say [this was] probably the first time we were down by more than one goal,” said Roy. “It was interesting to see the body language on the bench, because we’re not used to this. We’re not used to being down two, three goals.”\nSkating on the power play with 11 seconds left in the second period, sophomore Alexa Graziano scored on an assist from freshman Katie Pyne (three assists) to give the Cougars life.\nAdvertisement\nIn the locker room between the second and third periods, Roy said he gave his team an ultimatum.\n“We can come back, we just have to believe,” said Roy. “If somebody doesn’t believe, just stay in the locker room, and we’ll play with whoever wants to believe.”\nWith everyone back on the ice, the Cougars got back to their game in the final period.\nGraziano potted her second of the day at the 3:19 mark. Thirty seconds later, Pyne pounced for the tying goal.\n“We’re always going to play NDA hockey no matter what the score is,” said freshman goalie Erin Murray. “No matter if we’re down by one, if we’re down by five. We’re going to play NDA hockey and come back.”\nNotre Dame now must play on back-to-back days. Monday’s game was rescheduled from Feb. 9 because of weather. On Tuesday morning, Notre Dame hosts Plymouth in the Cougar Classic.\nLenny Rowe can be reached at lenny.rowe@globe.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fsports%2Fhigh-schools%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Fnotre-dame-girls-hockey-rallies-stay-unbeaten%2FnMWqcHNd6v0HgS0cbhDKwI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Notre", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fsports%2Fhigh-schools%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Fnotre-dame-girls-hockey-rallies-stay-unbeaten%2FnMWqcHNd6v0HgS0cbhDKwI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tNotre", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fsports%2Fhigh-schools%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Fnotre-dame-girls-hockey-rallies-stay-unbeaten%2FnMWqcHNd6v0HgS0cbhDKwI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Notre", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fsports%2Fhigh-schools%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Fnotre-dame-girls-hockey-rallies-stay-unbeaten%2FnMWqcHNd6v0HgS0cbhDKwI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Notre"], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:16:20.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
