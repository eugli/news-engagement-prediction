In the video, Noelle explains how her robot receives the energy to spin and then draws things thanks to the markers attached to it. \nRoosevelt Scales, Noelle’s father, told The Huffington Post that his daughter made the robot for school. She attends California’s Da Vinci Innovation Academy, a school that includes instruction both on-site and at home. \n“On site two days a week, she participates in project-based learning that ranges in topics from physics to fashion while her homeschool curriculum is culturally relevant and uses the Black365 calendar to introduce historical figures and events,” he said. “She also takes a weekly class at an art studio where they integrate science, technology, engineering, art and math (STEAM).” \nScales told HuffPost his daughter is always creating and drawing and that she makes something new every day. \n“She’ll make books, games, clothes ― she is very intrigued by new things and finding out the hows and whys,” he said. \nRobotics engineering is merely one of Noelle’s interests. Her dad said every day she aspires to be something different when she grows up. She is also into fashion, improv theater and painting. \nIn less than a week, Noelle has racked up more than 76,000 views on the Because of Them We Can Facebook page. \n“# FACT : Black talent is real,” the page wrote in the caption . \nThe 7-year-old also got another 51,000 views after HuffPost’s Philip Lewis posted it . Scales said it “was exciting” for his daughter to see the reach of her video. \n“We are just a regular family trying to enjoy life and give our kids the best opportunity to figure out life for themselves,” he said. “So we think it is great that something that she did and didn’t think much about can be shared and viewed because this is where the real life is found ― in kids experimenting to discover.” \nThe HuffPost Parents newsletter offers a daily dose of personal stories, helpful advice and comedic takes on what it’s like to raise kids today.
