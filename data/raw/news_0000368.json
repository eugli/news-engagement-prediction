\n'John' has an approved gun safe on his Pingrup property, about 50kms south of Lake Grace. \nHe hides his guns instead because he believed it was safer. \n\"I know it's against the law but I've got four high-powered rifles [and] those gun safes are so easy to get into,\" he said. \n\"In 30 seconds I've had one of those open with a simple cordless angle grinder. \n\"I'll always hide them in the same manner and I've never had a problem. If they can't find them, they can't steal them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T15:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:40:35.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
