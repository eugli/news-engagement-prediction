We are not in a recession. Our economy is still growing, but we recognise that the growth is uneven and there are some sectors which are going through a down cycle. That’s why the measures are focused on these particular sectors like marine and process, offshore engineering including construction. And I believe the targeted measures will help these particular industries\" he said. \nSome trade associations such as the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry had expressed disappointment that the Budget did not have more near-term measures to help businesses in a challenging environment, but Mr Wong said across the board, the Government is continuing many of the short-term measures put in place to help businesses cope with rising costs. These include the Wage Credit Scheme, the Special Employment Credit – which it is enhancing – as well as the SME Working Capital Loan programme. \nThere were also concerns that changes to the diesel tax system and a 30 per cent hike in water prices announced in the Budget will impact the bottomline of firms, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises. \nSaid Mr Wong: \"We are mindful of the concerns that businesses have over costs. We have put in place broad-based measures which are continuing from before, as well as targeted measures for specific industries. And we will continue to monitor the environment and if there is a need to, we will see what more we can do to help businesses.\" \nMr Wong clarified that a permanent 2 per cent cut in the budget caps of all ministries and organs of state announced in the Budget does not reflect a reduction in Government expenditure. Instead, the Government is better allocating resources to projects with higher priorities. \n\"What the 2 per cent cut does is, it takes resources from the cut in expenditure and it allocates them to areas of priority. So ministries that have projects that are of national importance or of priority to them, their projects will still be funded,\" he said. \nCatch the Singapore Budget Forum 2017 on Thursday at 8pm SG/HK on Channel NewsAsia and 9.30pm SG/HK on Channel 5. - CNA/ek", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:10:30.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
