Trends EU refugee & migrant influx , Eurozone crisis \n“Enough Excuses! Take Them In Now!” and “No More Deaths, Open The Borders!” slogans have been heard since 4 pm in Barcelona when hundreds of thousands gathered in support of the refugees. \nWhile Guàrdia Urbana, the municipal police, placed the number of protesters at 160,000 people, the organizers “Casa Nostra, Casa Vostra” insisted around 500,000 people attended the event. Avui ha estat un dia històric. Mig milió de persones hem dit que #VolemAcollir .

So far the country has only accepted some 1,100 refugees as part of the deal.

It's sometimes easy to let the hate overwhelm us but the #people of #Barcelona have brought so much hope. #volemacollir 😙😙😙 pic.twitter.com/qBQlXIjtmC — MSF Sea (@MSF_Sea) February 18, 2017 \nÒmnium Cultural, an association based in Barcelona, which has since 2012 actively demanded self-determination for Catalonia, called for “an own state” which will be “more supportive” and “able to host” more refugees, El Mundo reported. — Gabriel Rufián (@gabrielrufian) February 18, 2017 \nPro-independence member of the secretariat of the Assemblea Nacional Catalana, Gabriel Rufián, promised that independent Catalonia “will be a country open to all.” Read more Thousands hit streets in Barcelona to support on-trial former Catalan leader Mas \nHistorically Catalonia, which already enjoys significant autonomy from Madrid, has been one of Spain’s better-off regions and many of the local populace resent having to send taxes to the capital to help support poorer areas of the country. Catalonia accounts for one-fifth of Spain’s economic output and has had no problem in attracting foreign investment. \nIn November 2014, Catalans held a massive but symbolic regional independence vote, in defiance of the Spanish government’s ban. An overwhelming majority of participants, 80 percent, said “yes” to independence and secession from the central Spanish government in Madrid. \nFormer Catalan leader Artur Mas, as well as former Vice-President Joana Ortega and former Education Minister Irene Rigau now all stand accused of civil disobedience for staging the vote in breach of a legal order from Madrid, which vowed to crush any attempt to stage a referendum.
