The best marks from any of the three tests will account for the student’s all-India ranking, which decides her eligibility for admission. \nThe National Testing Service (NTS), a new overarching agency that the government announced in its annual budget this February to conduct all entrance exams for higher education institutions, might hold the JEE Main fully online from the next academic session. \nThe format will allow the NTS to hold the engineering test at least thrice a year, sources said. That way a student would not have to spend a full year studying for the test again. \nAt present, a student has the option of writing the JEE Main online or offline, but the exam is conducted just once a year. But only 125,000 of the almost 1 million students opt to take the test online. \n“To ensure greater transparency and avoid instances of paper leak, the ministry is planning to conduct examinations through NTS on an online mode,” said a senior official in the human resource development ministry. \nSources said the NTS is likely to conduct all entrance examinations — including JEE, CAT, and UGC-NET — online from 2018. \nEducation experts welcomed the move, underscoring that several global screening tests such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and TOEFL are conducted up to seven times a year. \n“This will ensure that a candidate is able to give his/her best if there are specific testing windows,” said Soumitra Roy of Prometric India, a global agency that had conducted tests such as CAT for premier business schools. \n“This must be done provided there is adequate physical and technical infrastructure in a country like India with different demographics.” \nTo ensure students from rural areas don’t face obstacles in taking the online exam, NTS will help prepare them with through round-the-clock call centre support. \n“NTS will establish an online testing mechanism which will be able to conduct online tests for at least 1 million students at a time with suitable systems for proctoring, instant display of marks and preparation of the merit list,” an official said. \nThe online system will ensure better safety mechanisms, according to Bipin Batra, executive director of the National Board of Examinations (NBE), which conducts entrance tests such as NEET PG and NEET Super Specialty for medical students.
