Call it the Kusama effect. How popular, exactly? In advance of the much-buzzed-about “Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors” exhibition opening Thursday, the museum sold 1,500 new memberships since December. 18 photos The \"Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors\" exhibit, opening Thursday at the Hirshhorn Museum… more That brings its total to 1,600. That’s right: before December, the Hirshhorn, which didn’t focus much on a membership model, had just one-sixteenth of the members it has today. And at $250 apiece, those new members brought in an additional $375,000 to the public museum. While museum officials can’t be sure that the Kusama exhibit, which is the first large-scale survey of the Japanese artist’s infinity room installations, is the cause, the timing of the membership spike is telling, said museum director Melissa Chiu . “We believe a lot of them did sign up because of the Kusama exhibit,” Chiu said. They are interested in creating a deeper connection to the D.C. area going forward, however. “It’s about building a community and keeping them connected in a meaningful way,” she added. Down the road, that could include programming and other experiences that keep locals excited about contemporary art, museum officials said. New full memberships aren’t the only silver lining. In mid-February, the museum’s administrators released a limited-edition “Kusama Circle” membership for $50 per person that will allow buyers to access the “members” line anytime during the exhibition, will will run from Feb. 23 to May 14. Another 1,500 people purchased those, bringing in another $75,000. (They’re still on offer, by the way, and might be the best way to have your pick of days to visit without a timed ticket.) The museum also saw lightning-fast responses to the first release of timed tickets for the show — similar to the tickets the National Museum of African American History and Culture has been offering since it opened — with 10,000 tickets being booked in less than four hours. (The first weekend slots the Hirshhorn made available booked up within six minutes, says Communications Director Allison Peck .) In all, the Hirshhorn expects the exhibit to draw approximately 300,000 visitors to the museum to view the whimsical and at times mind-bending mirror rooms, sculptures and mixed-media work from Kusama, who has never had an institutional exhibition of this size and scope. That projected visitorship will put it up there with recent large-scale, Instagram-friendly exhibits such as “Wonder” at the Renwick Gallery , which drew 730,000 people during its seven-month run, or “The Beach” at the National Building Museum , which drew 120,000 in July and August of 2015. So how are all those people going to fit into the Hirshhorn’s signature round building? In phases, with a lot of planning. The museum has hired 120 additional employees and volunteers, including 30 paid museum guides, to help the process run smoothly. The museum added public lockers, and concessions were added for the first time ever: a pop-up Dolcezza stand with coffee, pastries and gelato will welcome visitors in the central plaza of the round building for the duration of the exhibit. There are also more bathrooms, though they’ll also be al fresco in the plaza, in the form of those fancy portable restrooms you often see at weddings. Organizers even hired the same firm that maps crowd patterns at Disney theme parks to help them visualize how people would move through the exhibit, where the choke points would be and how to manage them. All that was done with a goal of making the experience as positive as possible, Chiu said. “We’re making every effort to make the visitor comfortable, and provide the basic necessities,” she said. “So that takes the pressure off and they can simply enjoy the exhibit.” Come this weekend, we’ll know whether it worked.
