You’d think Laura Dern’s favorite color is gold. After all the actor, director and producer has earned several Emmy and Academy Award nominations, five Golden Globe nominations and three Golden Globe Awards. Despite all that gold, Dern's favorite hue just might be turquoise. The color represents awareness and education about lung cancer, and Dern is on a mission to educate women about their risk for lung cancer. It’s not just a “man's disease,” she says. “Lung cancer is the No. 1 cancer killer of women, killing almost twice as many women as any other cancer,” Dern says. I n an exclusive interview with Lifescript, Laura Dern opens up about how her Oscar-nominated role in the 2014 film “Wild” sparked a passion to raise lung cancer awareness and education... About 221,200 new cases (105,590 of them in women) will be diagnosed in the U.S. this year; about 71,660 women will die of the disease, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). One of them was Bobbi Lambrecht, whose daughter, Cheryl, wrote the 2012 memoir, Wild , (Vintage Books.) Lambrecht died of lung cancer in 1991 at age 45, only seven weeks after being diagnosed. Dern, 49, portrayed Strayed’s mother in her Oscar-nominated role in the movie adaptation of the bestseller. “Portraying Bobbi was so powerful for me because my own life was affected by lung cancer,” says Dern, who was 6 years old when her grandfather succumbed to lung cancer. In her memoir, Strayed describes Bobbi as a “45 -year-old vegetarian-ish, garlic-eating, natural-remedy-using” woman who “only smoked when she was younger.” Lambrecht hadn’t smoked for many years before her diagnosis of late-stage lung cancer. I n an exclusive interview with Lifescript, Laura Dern opens up about how her Oscar-nominated role in the 2014 film “Wild” sparked a passion to raise lung cancer awareness and education... “Bobbi was given a year, if she was lucky, to live,” Dern says. “She was told there was nothing that could be done.” Today, however, if lung cancer is caught early, in its more treatable, stages, it doesn't have to be a death sentence. More than 430,000 people diagnosed with lung cancer are alive today, according to the ACS. “The tragedy is that [Lambrecht] only lasted weeks after her diagnosis, largely because we didn’t know then the importance of early detection and exploring a variety of treatment options,” Dern says. That’s why Dern has teamed up with the American Lung Association's Lung Force, a nationwide initiative to fight the disease in women. She and Strayed have debuted statement jewelry featuring Lung Force's signature color, turquoise, on the red carpet. Dern also donned a turquoise Badgley Mischka dress at the Vanity Fair party following the 2015 Academy Awards ceremony. I n an exclusive interview with Lifescript, Laura Dern opens up about how her Oscar-nominated role in the 2014 film “Wild” sparked a passion to raise lung cancer awareness and education... In this exclusive interview, Dern spoke with Lifescript to help raise awareness of lung cancer, including knowing the symptoms as well as the screening recommendations. Before playing Bobbi Lambrecht, was lung cancer on your radar? I have to admit it wasn’t – and it should have been, because I lost my grandfather to it when I was 6 and a dear family friend had been diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer. Few women have lung cancer on their radar at all, yet it is the No. 1 cancer killer of women. Something is very off. What do you about remember your grandfather’s battle with the disease? I remember him coughing all the time. But no one in the family talked about what killed him. Back then, no one really understood what lung cancer was. I n an exclusive interview with Lifescript, Laura Dern opens up about how her Oscar-nominated role in the 2014 film “Wild” sparked a passion to raise lung cancer awareness and education... The most palpable thing that I remember with my grandfather –and that struck me about what Bobbi [Lambrecht] experienced – was how quickly a person with lung cancer loses the ability to breathe comfortably. I can’t imagine being immediately impacted with the need for oxygen and the inability to walk comfortably. To have to fight for life while experiencing limited ability to breathe … it’s such a devastating illness. Did your role in “Wild” help you better understand your grandfather’s illness? I’ve come to know that there were many misconceptions about the illness at the time he was sick [in the early 1970s], even among medical professionals. The doctor told him that if he was coughing a lot, he could smoke to clear his lungs. That’s just crazy! But what’s most shocking is that today so many – too many – women still don’t know how to care for their lungs. I n an exclusive interview with Lifescript, Laura Dern opens up about how her Oscar-nominated role in the 2014 film “Wild” sparked a passion to raise lung cancer awareness and education... What impact did the movie role have on your current awareness of lung cancer? Portraying Bobbi all these years later was a reminder that we haven’t learned and grown that much in terms of our awareness. And it’s my hope that by talking about this disease I will inspire other women to be aware of their lung health. I can’t imagine being 44 years old and a mother and receiving a diagnosis like Bobbi did, then being dead in just weeks. [ Editor’s note: Dern has two children with ex-husband Ben Harper, a son Ellery, 15, and a daughter, Jaya, 11.] Before Bobbi’s illness, in 1991, she didn’t have the information to know that she should consider her lung health. The message is loud and clear to all of us [women] that we need mammograms, and that’s thanks in part to the tremendous work of many people, including my close friend Sheryl Crow. I n an exclusive interview with Lifescript, Laura Dern opens up about how her Oscar-nominated role in the 2014 film “Wild” sparked a passion to raise lung cancer awareness and education... She also has done so much to support the message that women should share and tell everyone about their [cancer] diagnosis and educate each other in the hopes of solving this health problem. While it’s important that so many women are caring for their breasts, I don’t know one woman who’s getting chest X-rays to screen for lung cancer. [ Editor’s note: According to the American Cancer Society, people who meet ALL of the following criteria may be candidates for lung cancer screening via X-ray or CT scan: Are 55 to 74 years old In fairly good health Have at least a 30 pack-year smoking history (e.g., having smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years or 2 packs a day for 15 years) Are either still smoking or have quit smoking within the last 15 years] I n an exclusive interview with Lifescript, Laura Dern opens up about how her Oscar-nominated role in the 2014 film “Wild” sparked a passion to raise lung cancer awareness and education... Do you feel that you face a higher risk of lung cancer because of your family history? Because my grandfather was a smoker, I associated his death with that. He lived in a time when we weren’t as educated about lung cancer. People were chain smoking then, and we didn’t have the information about the risks that poses that we do know. So somehow, I had in my mind that I didn’t have to worry about [lung cancer]. But people incorrectly associate lung cancer exclusively with smoking. Smoking isn't the only way one can get the disease. That’s why we all have to become educated and aware of all the factors influencing lung cancer. It can happen to anyone, including nonsmokers, like [actor and activist] Valerie Harper . I n an exclusive interview with Lifescript, Laura Dern opens up about how her Oscar-nominated role in the 2014 film “Wild” sparked a passion to raise lung cancer awareness and education... [ Editor’s note: Smoking causes 90% of lung cancer cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And smokers are 15 to 30 times more likely to develop lung cancer or die from the disease than nonsmokers. Even occasional smoking can raise the risk. So can exposure to secondhand smoke.] What do women need to know most about lung cancer? [It is vital] to talk to your doctor about your individual risk and to have necessary screenings early to detect any abnormalities in more treatable stages. Hopefully, by women like Valerie sharing their stories, and all of us talking about lung health, we women will become empowered to not be afraid to get ourselves checked, to consider our environment. We all need to use our voices and band together to create awareness and encourage caring for our lungs. For expert advice and more information, visit Lifescript’s Cancer Health Center .
