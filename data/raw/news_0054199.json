It was later seen on CCTV turning back onto Grange Lane from Salisbury Road at 05:40.\nJust before 5am Tommy's lights are out they are not on and just before 6am his lights are on so I believe attack happened during that period of time the car was obviously on that road during that time and was parked up for approximately 25 minutes so it's either the people that are involved in the offence or it is a significant witness.\n– Det Ch Insp Victoria Short Last updated Thu 23 Feb 2017 South Yorkshire Rotherham", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:51:24.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
