Some of them will. Others might need more work done than others.” \nOff the ice, the Oval is showing its age: the sight lines and seats could use a face lift. But other than those upgrades plus new ski jumps and a second arena, Calgary may be in a position to host again without having to buy other new venues. \n“The benefit that will be derived from this can hopefully be monetized on one hand and be clearly evident to the people who have to make the decisions,” he said. \nWatch below from Dec. 21, 2016: Speaking in Calgary, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he looks forward to more discussion about a Calgary Olympic bid. \nThree decades ago, the Games cost about $1 billion. In 2026, that could be the cost just to secure them. Some have pegged the total price tag at $5.3 billion–less than the $7.7 billion spent on Vancouver in 2010. \nNo provincial or federal funding has been promised as of yet. \n“One of the things that we’re very much aware of is the cost-overrun issue,” Hanson said. \nWatch below: On June 20, 2016, Kevin Smith spoke with young athletes who are dreaming of competing in a 2026 Calgary Olympics amid reports of a proposal put forward at city council. \nAt a press conference Thursday, Mayor Naheed Nenshi said most of the $5 million granted by city council for Olympic exploration work will go towards creating a “hosting plan.” \n“The hosting plan is very useful even if we choose not to bid on the Olympics, because it gives us a real sense of the city’s ability to host very large-scale events in terms of: what hotel rooms do we have? What transportation networks do we have? As well as what facilities can fit modern standards, from conventions to sporting events? \n“I understand they are certainly looking at coming in at or below their budget by the time they get here in July and resources are really focused on creating that content.” \nAfter the recommendation is presented in July, council will then decide on whether to move forward with a formal bid, which is required sometime next year. \nWhile Hanson is looking at the prospects with enthusiasm, his focus is on being objective. \n“We need to answer the question: why would we? What’s the net benefit to Calgary, Alberta and Canada?” \nWith files from Erika Tucker © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:42:25.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
