This isn’t going to be good because I know the history between the two of them.’” \nAdams added that the man named Corey in the report had his eye set on Oakley, who was forcibly removed from the Garden Wednesday and then subsequently arrested. \nOakley was charged with three counts of assault and one count of criminal trespass. Owner James Dolan banned Oakley from the Garden on Friday, claiming Oakley was acting in an “abusive manner\" and may have a drinking problem. \nBut the internal report tells a different story, according to Adams.

By the time he sits down on his seat, it’s already on. So Corey goes over to say something to Mr. Dolan. Oakley yells. Corey comes over and says, ‘You have to leave now.’ That’s when the decision was made to eject him. Fans didn’t complain. He wasn’t disrupting the game.” \n“They had a prior history,” Adams said of Corey and Oakley, based on the report he claims he acquired Sunday night. “People feel this is not how you should treat a person who gave his heart and soul to his team…This show is far from over. This is only the first quarter. There are three more quarters to go and you better believe, if they want to win this, they better get ahead of me.” \nAdams said he was set to speak with Dolan on Monday afternoon, but the meeting was canceled due to a new development. Adams said he wasn’t aware what the new development was, but he hoped it would lead to a solution. \n“This is a high-profile VIP that sat in the most expensive seat in Madison Square Garden,” he said. “They broke their protocol. Their protocols are broken. Oakley kept asking, ‘Why are you staring at me? Why are all of you standing around keep staring at me? I’m here to watch the game. Why are you blocking my view? Why am I being treated in this fashion?’ He was basically targeted by the time he sat down.” \nAdams got involved in, he said, because this is a recurring issue in his life and that of others'.

(Susan Watts/New York Daily News) \n“Every time I fly first class, someone stops me to see my ticket over, and over and over again,” Adams said. “It sends the wrong message to black boys and black leaders. Even when you sit in the most expensive seat in Madison Square Garden, you are treated in that manner. This would not have happened to Bill Bradley and Dave DeBusschere.” \nAdams said he spoke to Rev. Al Sharpton this morning and other leaders. Rev. Sharpton’s civil rights organization, the National Action Network, released a statement Monday calling for Dolan to lift the ban on Oakley. The NAN threatened to protest outside the Garden if Dolan does not comply with the demand. \n“This is an issue that is not going to go away,” Adams said. “Dolan must understand that the basketball court is not a place where you are going to treat people disrespectfully when they complete their careers. And it sends the wrong message to the countless number of young people, particularly in the inner city that use basketball as a way to escape some of the difficult times that they are going through. \n“That was a terrible blemish on the legacy of the New York Knicks, and the legacy of those who are considered heroes.” Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:51:16.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
