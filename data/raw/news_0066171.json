The families had sought restitution for a 6ha parcel of land which was currently worth R120 million. \nThe eight families were evicted from Constantia years after it was declared for whites-only in terms of the Groups Areas Act in 1961. \nMost of the claimants were either the children, or the grandchildren of those evicted. The oldest living beneficiary will be 90 this year. \nToday, De Lille will sign over transfer of the land to the regional Land Claims Commissioner who will bring the families closer to returning to their homes. \nUsman Kherekar, 74, was aged 25 when his family were forced out of their Kendal Road, Constantia, home. \n“In 1968 we were told to move when it was declared a whites-only area,” said Kherekar. His parents got “a little bit of money” for their home but he says it was not commensurate with the value of the property. \n“We managed to buy two plots in Grassy Park and built a house,” said Kherekar. \nFatima Allie, who was born in Constantia, said the families, seeking justice, started the process of claiming their land 30 years ago. \n“I was born in Constantia,” Allie said. \n“My mother inherited the property from her father. She got married and moved to Claremont.\" \nThe family was evicted from their home in Draper Street, Claremont, in 1966 and ended up in Athlone. \n“My mother’s sister owned that property (in Claremont) but they’re still waiting for their claim to be resolved,” said Allie. \nShe said the De Lille’s gesture “happened so fast” that it shocked many of the claimants who had been battling bureaucratic red tape for years. \n“I can’t believe it. We were called to the Cape Town (civic centre) and out popped the mayor. \n\"She said ‘this had been going on for too long’ and signed off the handover,” said Allie. \nShe applauded De Lille for having done her homework, and knowing all the facts surrounding the issue.
