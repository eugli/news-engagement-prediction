Lee Carter leaves Albert Square \n“After he’d agreed to time off with the BBC he knew it was only a matter of time before the news got out. \n“He knew the heat was coming and didn’t want to bring his family into the media circus. \n“So he got on a plane. He’s still in contact with the family and Jo, his wife, might join him later. \n“He’s calling it his ‘gardening leave’. He’ll be away for at least a month. He just wanted to disappear.” “I’ve always taken drugs and I probably always will” Danny Dyer's autobiography \nDanny’s behaviour at the National Television Awards, where he fell off the wagon after a bid to quit alcohol at the start of the year, set alarm bells ringing for family, pals and colleagues. \nThe BBC agreed to give the £470,000-a-year actor a break from filming. And our source revealed Danny knows this is his final chance to “sort his life out”. \nThe London-born star has made no secret of his boozing and drug-taking. \nGETTY SLOSHED: Danny was drunk at the National Television Awards this year \nIn his 2010 autobiography, he wrote: “I’ve always taken drugs and I probably always will. But there’s a difference between having the odd crafty bump up the snout as a reward for a job well done and letting it rule your life.” \nTwo years ago he shocked fans when he called for cocaine to be legalised, arguing that it “hasn’t killed as many people” as cigarettes and alcohol. \nAnd in 2013, just months before he joined EastEnders, he admitted he had smoked crack. \nBBC TAKING THE MICK: Danny Dyer has said he is on 'Gardening leave' \nHe said: “Crack is like coke times 20. You get a massive rush and you feel like you could take on the world. \n“It’s like your blood has been removed and replaced with electricity. I took to it like a duck to water.” \nThe insider said: “It was obvious how drunk Danny was at the NTAs. Everyone knew it was best that he took some time off to sort his life out. \n“It’s not the first time Danny has had to deal with his issues. South Africa could be just the ticket.” Danny Dyer’s Words Of Wisdom Thursday, 8th December 2016 Danny Dyer imparts a whole load of wisdom on the world, as these memorable quotes prove. 1 / 19 \nDanny isn’t the first celebrity to recuperate in South Africa. In 2012, TV presenter Gail Porter checked into a luxury rehab centre in Cape Town to beat her depression and addiction to alcohol. \nDanny has three children with wife Joanne Mas, 40 – Dani, 20, Sunnie, nine, and Arty, three. \nThey have been together more than 20 years but he has been accused of cheating on her several times. \nGETTY LAST CHANCE: The Eastenders star could be on his final warning \nA BBC spokesman said: “Danny is on a short break from EastEnders. This was not enforced by bosses nor has he quit the show. \n“There is absolutely no truth that an exit storyline is being discussed or planned. \n“We are extremely mindful of cast workloads and have the utmost duty of care to all our cast and crew members.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:38:54.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
