We should have done better and we will definitely do better next time. As allies we have a responsibility to own it when we mess up.” \nGalvin also commented on the joke last month on Twitter, noting that the show “respects and loves the bi community\" and writing, “I am sorry if we offended anyone. I hope you know our show fights for visibility and inclusivity and we will do better in the future. BUT, we also have to remember, it’s a comedy.” \nABC has not responded to Ramirez's criticism. \nAnd as someone who worked 4 them 4 10 years+,am truly disheartened & disappointed quite frankly.I will invest my brand where I'm respected. https://t.co/NQQAPDsFlU — Sara Ramirez (@SaraRamirez) February 16, 2017 \nDear @ABCNetwork @TheRealONeals :own it,address it,clarify it,empower our #Queer #Bisexual youth & community w/accurate positive reflections ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:53:06.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
