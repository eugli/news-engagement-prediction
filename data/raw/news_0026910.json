I feel that if others were to hold a rally and we hold a counter-rally, this thing will never end. \n\"This is not about rallying (in protest or support) but it is about education and how do we inform people (about Act 355),\" he said. \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
