It was about a month, I think, where it probably disrupted us, because if you’re Sunderland you didn’t know what your manager was doing.\n“The thing with the settlement took a bit of time as well. That probably hindered it. So when we went to France with the boys, every day we were watching players to see what we could do, while I was still trying to get to know the ones I’d just taken over.
