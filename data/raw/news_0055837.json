But we decided against it because I have just come out of one reality show and didn't want to jump into another so soon.\"\n  A post shared by Kishwer M Rai (@kishwersmerchantt) onFeb 13, 2017 at 3:52am PST\n \nAnother popular TV couple, Kishwer Merchantt and Suyyash Rai, who tied the knot last year, have also rejected the offer to appear in 'Nach Baliye 8'.
