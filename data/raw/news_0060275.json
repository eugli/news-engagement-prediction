Although both the companies did not disclose the deal size, internal sources from the companies said it ranges between Rs 6,500 crore and Rs 7,000 crore. According to Telenor, the transaction will not trigger any impairment. As of fourth quarter 2016, the remaining value of tangible and intangible assets in Telenor India amounted to 0.3 billion Norwegian Krone. The transaction is subject to requisite regulatory approvals, including approvals from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and the Competition Commission of India. As part of the agreement, Airtel will acquire Telenor India’s running operations in seven circles - Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP (East), UP (West) and Assam. These circles represent a high population concentration and therefore offer a high potential for growth, the company said. \"On completion, the proposed acquisition will undergo seamless integration, both on the customer as well as the network side, and further strengthen our market position in several key circles. Customers of Telenor India will now be able to enjoy India’s widest and fastest voice and data network, and a range of Airtel’s world-class products and services,\" Gopal Vittal, Managing Director and CEO (India and South Asia), Bharti Airtel, said. The proposed acquisition will include transfer of all of Telenor India’s assets and customers, further augmenting Airtel’s overall customer base and network. \"The proposed transaction will also create substantial long-term value for our shareholders given the significant synergies,\" Vittal added. Spectrum footprint It will also enable Airtel to further bolster its strong spectrum footprint in these seven circles, with the addition of 43.4 MHz spectrum in the 1800 MHz band, the company said. Airtel will ensure quality services to Telenor India’s customers, while offering them the added benefits of its innovative product portfolio, access to superior voice and data services, mobile banking, VAS and domestic/ international roaming facilities. Telenor India’s operations and services will continue as normal until the completion of the transaction, it said. \"Finding a long-term solution to our India business has been a priority for us, and we are pleased with our agreement with Airtel. The decision to exit India has not been taken lightly. After thorough consideration, it is our view that the significant investments needed to secure Telenor India’s future business on a standalone basis will not give an acceptable level of return,\" Sigve Brekke, Chief Executive Officer of Telenor Group, said.
