Scientists believe this next generation machine could be many millions of times faster than contemporary computers. \nAn international team the University of Sussex published the new blueprint in the academic journal Science Advances. ‘Push the limits’: China to create world’s first quantum info teleport in 2016 https://t.co/Qki7uZil37 pic.twitter.com/zwneo49yU6 — RT (@RT_com) January 14, 2016 \n“ For many years, people said that it was completely impossible to construct an actual quantum computer. With our work we have not only shown that it can be done but now we are delivering a nuts and bolts construction plan to build an actual large-scale machine ,” lead scientist Winfried Hensinger said in a statement. \nThe revolutionary potential of quantum computers lies in their ability to work at the atomic level, where an atom can mysteriously exist in two different places at the same time. \nThis means a qubit – the quantum version of a traditional ‘bit’ of computer information – can be both 1 and 0 at the same time. At the moment, a ‘bit’ can only be 1 or 0. \nScientists believe a computer system that operates on this level can perform many more multiple calculations at one time. \nPrevious attempts at building a quantum machine have been limited to a computing capability of 10 or 15 qubits, but now physicists claim to have come up with a way around this restriction.

I am very excited to work with industry and government to make this happen. ” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T18:17:59.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
