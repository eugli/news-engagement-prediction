That will be integrated into the winning vessel.\" Photo: Christopher Pyne alongside Italian sailors aboard the frigate. (ABC News: Tom Fedorowytsch) \nSouth Australian Defence Industries Minister Martin Hamilton-Smith said the vessel was open to the public and would stay docked at Outer Harbor for five days. \n\"It will be an opportunity for individual companies, including workers, to get on board the ship and see the standard required,\" he said. \n\"There is an array of sensors and combat systems here that are at the very cutting edge of software technology and weapons systems technology. \n\"My principle message for defence industry is to get down and visit the ship, tour the ship, look at the standard of engineering, project management that will be required to ensure your company is ready to go with this work.\" \nAs part of the visit, Fincantieri will host an industry forum on Thursday. \nThe successful vessels will replace the Anzac-class frigate and will have greater anti-submarine capabilities than their predecessors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:19:02.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
