At last check on 2/7 there were 13. Right now there are zero,\" wrote Shannon Coulter, cofounder of #GrabYourWallet, a social media campaign to boycott businesses that are affiliated with the president and his family members.\nBurlington joins a number of retailers who have stripped her products from their websites but still sell them in their brick and mortar stores, including TJ Maxx and Saks Off Fifth. Other stores have wiped out her line from their websites and stores.\n  In early February, the president first tweeted that Nordstrom had treated his daughter \"so unfairly,\" repeating the message across his social media platforms and raising ethics concerns . Nordstrom cited poor sales in announcing its decision, which also came after customer complaints about the brand's association with the Republican president.\nAsked about the president's statement on TV later that week, Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said she does \"find it ironic that you've got some executives all over the Internet bragging about what they've done to her and her line â€¦ to get to him.\"\nIvanka Trump has not issued a statement since the fallout started in January.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:04:48.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
