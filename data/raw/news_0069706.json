The Indian IT industry has thrived over the “offshore” business model. \nAmerica accounts for 65% of $155 billion Indian IT revenue. \nHowever, according to a senior government official who had knowledge of the meeting said that things looked positive. “US-India has a good relationship historically. India and US compliments and supplements each other in several areas especially with Indian talent adding value to US firms and the biggest examples are Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Google CEO Sundar Pichai,” he said. \nThe source, who is highly placed in the government, added that nearly 75% of all Fortune-500 companies are serviced by Indian IT firms, and that some of the top IT firms doing business in India, are of American origin, such as Cisco, Google and Amazon. \nMeanwhile, Nirmala Sitharaman, minister of commerce and industry said that “the issue” had been discussed in details with the US Congressmen. “Business always flourishes in an environment of certainty and transparency. So even this visa related issue is an issue on which we would want to have an air of certainty and also transparency,” she told reporters on Tuesday. \nSitharaman added that the US Congress is waiting for the new administration to settle down, and once that happens, the Congressmen will play an important role in the coming out with the rules. \nIndian IT sector, contributes 9.3% to the country’s GDP, and employs of 3.7 million people. The uncertainty has led to drop in value, and fall in employment. \nThe US has introduced the Lofgren Bill, which proposes the minimum wages being doubled to $130,000. The current H1-B minimum wage of $60,000 was fixed in 1989. \nHowever, most H1-B visa holders get an average of $1,00,000, according to consultancy firm, Greyhound Research. \nThe government source added, “The Indian government has asked the visiting US lawmakers to keep the Indian IT firms’ contribution in mind while the new government is reassessing its policy on immigration.” \nTo hold further discussions in the matter, a Nasscom delegation from India, will visit the US for a week-long trip. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:12:51.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
