By Jill Daly   \nLess is more. \nThat’s the focus of new national guidelines to manage labor and delivery for low-risk women. \n“The less intervention, the more control you feel you have over it,” said Kathy Rex-Reefer, 31, of Bloomfield, who had help from both her husband, Brandon Reefer, and midwives at West Penn Hospital when she gave birth to her daughter, Frances, now 22 weeks old. \nMidwives and physicians in Pittsburgh say the guidelines released Jan. 25 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are a welcome confirmation of longtime midwife practices and more recent adaptations in hospital labor and delivery rooms. Among these are noninvasive monitoring and ways to help a woman cope with labor and delivery without drugs. \n“This is what we’ve been doing since the beginning of time,” said nurse midwife Ann McCarthy, clinical director of The Midwife Center in the Strip District. \nMost of the recommendations are already in practice at Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC, according to Richard Beigi, medical director. The same is true at West Penn, said Mark Caine, chief of maternal health programs for Allegheny Health Network. Both facilities have certified nurse midwives available to help patients. \nAfter reviewing research on many of the practices, the obstetricians’ opinion lends support to practices that individualize patient care, including: intermittent monitoring of the fetal heart rate, nondrug forms of pain relief, delays in induced labor for women with a premature breaking of the amniotic membrane, one-on-one emotional support, position changes during labor, flexibility in breathing methods when pushing, and even a rest of an hour or two before pushing, if that is possible because of epidural anesthesia. \nBoth doctors said interventions can be limited in many of the deliveries of women who have carried their baby to term, are in labor on their own and who had prenatal care with no problems. \n“It’s important that The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has issued this,” Dr. Beigi said. “These are things that in some settings are slow to adopt this.” Both doctors said avoiding interventions in labor and delivery is balanced with a concern for safety. \n“From a physician’s perspective, they want optimal outcomes,” Dr. Caine said. “They’re generally willing to do what patients ask, as long as they feel it’s safe.” \nWaiting longer \nFor women at low risk, for example, hospital admission could be delayed until the cervix is dilated about 6 centimeters out of a total of 10. If things are progressing normally and there’s no concern that requires internal fetal monitoring, the amniotic membrane might not have to be broken. And if the membrane is ruptured early, and labor is slow, a woman and her providers might decide to wait — up to 24 hours in some cases — before labor is induced with drugs if there is no health reason to hurry. \nWest Penn nurse midwife Nicole Rawson and Dr. Caine said they recommend not waiting past 12 hours before something is done to improve the labor. \nAt The Midwife Center, Ms. McCarthy said, “Women have to be in very active labor by 24 hours. They don’t have to be delivered.” \nFetal monitoring \nThe ACOG recommends noninvasive periodic monitoring of the fetal heart rate for low-risk patients, which is not a practice at many hospitals. \nContinuous monitoring can restrict a woman’s movement because she’s hooked up to the monitors. Walking and changing positions help with comfort and speeding up the labor process. \nDr. Caine said in Pennsylvania continuous fetal heart rate monitoring is used in 98 percent of cases, for safety concerns, but new devices that let a woman walk during labor and noninvasive handheld scopes can be used safely. The rate can be checked every 15 minutes or half-hour, he said, adding, “Care can be individualized, assuming mom and baby are both stable.” Brandon Reefer and his wife, Kathy Rex-Reefer, and their daughter, Frances. (Nate Guidry/Post-Gazette) \nTeamwork in labor \nMs. Rawson said the ACOG opinion encourages midwives and doctors to work together, citing as an example showing medical residents how a hands-and-knees delivery is done. \nAlthough helping labor progress in a natural way can take longer, a woman who is prepared for the experience can use a variety of techniques and tools. \nUpright positions in particular lead to shorter labors, Ms. McCarthy said. “The majority of our births are on hands and knees. We generally let women decide what’s best for them. We have a lot of partner-supported squatting.” \nThe Midwife Center is expanding to include facilities for water births, which is not yet available in Pittsburgh. \nPregnant women at The Midwife Center must first go through an education process and are welcome to use doulas — a labor coach — to assist them at home and at the center, Ms. McCarthy said. \nGoing the distance \n“Because of those two reasons, we tell them to only come when they’re in active labor,” she said. Other ACOG recommendations, including allowing a woman to eat and drink during labor, have been a practice at the birth center for 34 years, she said. \n“If someone were running a marathon, you wouldn’t make them do without fluids and food,” she said, adding that the concern was if a woman later needed anesthesia for a cesarean section, she might aspirate something into her lungs. \n“But if you let them eat and drink and let labor run normally, they have a lower rate of C-section,” she said. \nDr. Beigi said Magee is part of a large multicenter study comparing the two approaches when labor does not progress: labor induction vs. expectant management. He said data has been inconclusive if inducing labor or the waiting method is safer or more effective. \nExpectant management can include a plan for self-care and scheduled reassessment — such as when contractions subside — or a plan to rest in the facility before admission for labor and delivery, if active labor is expected to begin shortly. \nCoping is key \nAnother ACOG guideline pointed out that a woman’s increased ability to cope with both the pain and other emotions of the childbirth experience has been found to be related to better birth outcomes, including shorter labor and lower cesarean rates. So the guide recommends support from doulas and offering women massage, relaxation techniques and, in early labor, water immersion. \nAt a doctor’s visit beforehand, nondrug pain relief is included in the discussion, Dr. Beigi said. \nACOG said gauging what a woman needs and wants during labor is helped by using a coping scale — not a hospital’s pain scale. \n“We don’t generally ask patients if they’re in pain,” Dr. Caine said. “It’s more like asking them, ‘How are you doing?’ and ‘What do you need?’” \nRest before pushing \nIf a patient has an epidural and is too tired to push, the ACOG suggests rest. “Sometimes people can rest in their labor room, take a short rest before pushing,” Dr. Beigi said. “Most of the time, with a little bit of rest, most women will be psychologically motivated.” \nAnother study is looking at that practice, he said. “We will know the answers to these questions in a few years.” \nNew mom Ms. Rex-Reefer said she had faith that her labor and delivery would go well with the limited-intervention approach. \n“It was exactly as I had envisioned it to happen. … I know I’m very lucky.” \nAfter early contractions at home, her water broke, and she called her midwife. She stayed home awhile longer, and after seven hours, she headed for the hospital. \n“They did monitoring when I got in there. They let me guide the process a little bit. Their focus was on me being comfortable. ... I would say things like, ‘I really need an ice pack’ or ‘I need to walk around now.’… It did feel like I had some control.” In all, it took 15 hours. \nShe said she stayed upright through the active labor: “My pain would escalate tremendously when I laid down. I gave birth in a standing squat. My husband supported me. It worked for us.” \nJill Daly: jdaly@post-gazette.com, 412-263-1596.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:08:50.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
