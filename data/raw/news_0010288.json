In our professional opinion, this Order cannot be justified on national security or foreign policy grounds.” \nIt is a well-known if frequently ignored fact on the right that no citizen of any country affected by the ban has ever committed a terrorist attack on U.S. soil and the brief makes the all-important point that “The overwhelming majority of attacks have been committed by U.S. citizens.” \nAt length, the brief then explains the various sorts of harm that will be done to the United States by Trump’s order, not only by endangering U.S. forces in the field (of little concern to a draft dodger like Trump) but also intelligence gathering, and, obviously, foreign policy and national security: \nTrump’s action was ill-considered and ill-conceived and he has given a golden opportunity to the forces arrayed against him to present a cogent rebuttal of those claims. As presented here, actually foreign policy experts have shown that Admiral Mullin was right to call for Steve Bannon’s dismissal from the National Security Council. \nPresident Obama demonstrated what a sober, pragmatic foreign policy looks like. Republicans hated it. Now they are demonstrating to the world what ideology bereft of facts gets the United States. As this document shows, it puts us all in danger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T19:50:34.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
