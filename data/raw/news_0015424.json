The company has yet to return CTV’s calls. \nFollowing the incident, Cerantola’s colleagues posted the e-mail exchange on Facebook, generating messages of support for the couple and dozens of photographer recommendations. \n“I have like 29 photographers to go through now, so it brought some good in it,” Cerantola said. In the meantime, he hopes that Premiere Productions will change their policies so such discrimination stops. \nNiemi, however, believes the couple should take legal action. \n“We have to stop this kind of use of religion as a proxy to promote anti-gay bias,” he said. \nWith files from CTV Montreal Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:54:22.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
