Â© Kyodo \nSEOUL/SINGAPORE -- Malaysian police have confirmed that the North Korean man killed Monday in Kuala Lumpur was the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the Bernama state news agency reports. \nA North Korean man in his 40s died suddenly at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, an officer from the police division overseeing the airport told The Nikkei. \nKim Jong Nam had arrived in Malaysia on Feb. 6 and was attacked Monday before boarding a plane to Macau, according to the Malaysiakini online news outlet. He was taken to a nearby clinic but then died en route to a hospital, a Singaporean television station reports. Police said no arrests had been made so far. \nTwo women were responsible for Kim's death, according to a South Korean source. Reports said they killed him via poisoned needle before fleeing in a taxi. They are suspected to have been North Korean agents. \nA South Korean official also confirmed Kim's death through the Malaysian government. Seoul will issue a statement as early as Wednesday morning, according to local news channel YTN. \nKim Jong Nam was the eldest son of North Korea's previous leader, Kim Jong Il, and was once considered the favorite to succeed his father. He apparently fell out of the running after being detained in Tokyo in 2001 for trying to enter Japan with a fake passport, according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency. \nHe is said to have been living mostly in Malaysia, Singapore and elsewhere in Southeast Asia recently. He was upset when his half brother was picked over him to rule North Korea but had kept mostly silent on politics since Kim Jong Un actually took power. \nThe North Korean ruler continues to provoke the international community with such acts as launching a new medium-range missile into the Sea of Japan on Sunday. But in a New Year's speech, Kim Jong Un said he had \"spent the past year feeling anxious and remorseful for the lack of my ability,\" painting himself as tough on enemies but humble before the people. \nThough whether he was involved in his half brother's death remains unclear, South Korean reports claim that he eliminated a potential threat. Kim Jong Nam was close to Jang Song Thaek, a key official executed in 2013. The two were once rumored to have plotted to overthrow Kim Jong Un with China's help.
