On Friday, February 17, Hall Street Grill sent out a press release announcing new dinner and happy hour menus and a half-off wine special. But just days later, the phone line is disconnected and the website taken down. Real Estate Investment Group tells Eater the property is now available for lease. Hall Street Grill owner Steve McLain was not available for comment when Eater reached. McLain also owns Oba , serving Latin-inspired flavors in the Pearl District. According to KOIN 6, Hall Street Grill did leave a note on the door that read, \"After almost 25 years, Hall Street has closed its doors. Thank you for your patronage through the years.\" The news source also confirmed the closure came as a surprise to many in the Beaverton community, from Beaverton mayor Denny Doyle, to one member of the restaurant’s waitstaff and its bread delivery man.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:53:29.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
