Fashion Police host Brad Goreski, viewers at home can expect a sprinkling of outrageousness on Sunday. What will Gaga wear?

What we expect from the carpet is a mix of really fashion forward looks and a lot of outrageous looks as well.” \nTalking about trends, Brad - who styles the likes of Lea Michele - says bold stripes, whites and pretty florals have been taking over this year's red carpets. \nBut for the Grammys, he says expect embellished outfits, silvers, golds and bronzes.

At the Globes and also at the SAG Awards. We're seeing stripes too, which I think is something new and a little fresh. \n\"Michelle Dockery was in stripes and Michelle Williams. I thought it was a nice way to do pattern, print and colour at the same time. The other one we're seeing is florals. \n\"There's tons and tons of florals – floral patterns, floral lace. I think there's been a lot of interesting looks on the carpet this year, but at the Grammys I hope that we're going to be seeing a lot more embellished looks. \n\"We've been seeing a lot of metallics on the runway and in the collections as well, and the Grammys is a good place to wear your gold and your silver, your bronzes - and really take the opportunity to turn up the glitz a little bit.” This is one of Brad's favourite past Grammy red carpet looks Brad says Selena Gomez always brings a good red carpet look (Photo: FilmMagic) \nAnd who is he most looking forward to seeing grace the carpet in Los Angeles on Sunday? \n\"I'm always excited to see Beyonce of course. I also love seeing Adele on the red carpet, and rumour has it that Selena Gomez will be attending this year and she always brings a really good red carpet look.\" \nLive From the Red Carpet: Grammy Awards, Sunday 12th February @ 11pm, & Fashion Police: Grammy Awards Wednesday 15th February @ 9pm on E!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:15:11.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
