'If she didn't think I was old enough to see the film then why would I be old enough to have a drink?

The group had travelled for 45 minutes in blistery winter weather from their home in Mossbank to the cinema - which is 30 miles away. Joanne, said: 'We don't really get the chance to have a night out since we're new parents and had to plan a few days in advance to get a babysitter in.. 'This could have been so easily avoided if the duty manager just swallowed her pride. 'But there was quite a big queue behind us and I guess she didn't want to look weak.

'It took me quite a while to stop being so angry but eventually, after a few glasses of Prosecco, I saw the funny side.' Joanne posted a picture of her man enjoying a pint at the cinema's pub on their Facebook page. The filmhouse responded: 'Hi Joanne, I'm sorry your fiance was unable to get into Trainspotting 2 due to lack of ID. Steven visited the Mareel cinema in Lerwick, Shetland, Scotland, with Joanne and her brothers Marc Sherwood, 34, and Sean Nicol, 22 'Our staff are legally required to ask for proof that you are old enough to watch an age restricted film if they have any doubt. 'We follow the Challenge 25 policy here at Mareel, so we ID anyone who appears under 25 for 18 films. 'These decisions have to be made on the spot by the staff as without ID there is no other accurate way of telling age. 'The cinema staff believed him to be under 25, whereas the bar staff were happy he was over 25, in each case staff were just doing their job. 'I'm sorry this affected your evening but we have no choice but to fulfill our legal obligations. 'So please, please anyone who is under 25, or may look under 25, make sure you bring ID with you, we don't like having to turn anyone away.'
