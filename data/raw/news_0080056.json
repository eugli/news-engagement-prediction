We are scared of operating because of the attacks. \n\"We are not getting any form of protection from the government. They should go where the drugs are. \n\"I'm proudly Nigerian and I don't deal in drugs. \n\"They must find the drug dealers and arrest them,\" he said. The way foreigners are labelled is wrong. \n\"The problem comes from the top. They must stop using our blood for politics.\" \nLike Kingston, Charles Ntui, from Cameroon, has lost faith in the government. \n\"I can't tell the government how to deal with these xenophobic attacks. They know what they have to do. \n\"We don't feel safe. Even from where I am standing, I feel scared,\" he said. \nNtui is the owner of Edu-Cent Day in Jeppestown, which was broken into and looted on Sunday night. \nThe crèche is now ruined and empty. Only the remnants of broken glass, plates and a couple of children's aprons can be seen on the premises. \nAn angry Ntui said he was left with no choice but to close the crèche down. \n\"What can I do? I am not gaining anything from this. \n\"The only thing that is left for me now is to just pack up and go. \n\"This crèche was looking after children of whom at least 80% were South African. The staff I employed here are all South Africans.\" \nWhen The Times visited the crèche, Ntui and his staff were packing up and taking what was left in the premises as police patrolled the area. \nHe believes the incident was \"carefully\" planned. \n\"This is a planned act. It is well-organised. Their own shops were not hit by the attacks,\" he said, referring to those businesses owned by South Africans. \nWhile the area was calm yesterday, shop owners were boarding up their stores. \nOthers were operating behind locked gates. \n\"They tried to break into my shop, but I called the police and they shot them with rubber bullets,\" said Shanidul Islam, the owner of Babbly supermarket, while he and his staff barricaded the shop with iron sheets. \n\"When the police leave, [the looters] come back to attack us.\" \nMember of the mayoral committee for safety in Johannesburg Michael Sun said metro police would be patrolling the area day and night to contain the attacks in Jeppestown. \nA march against xenophobic attacks, planned for Friday last week to the Union Buildings in Pretoria, was postponed and will now be held next month. \n- TMG Digital Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
