SHARE Senator Cory Bernardi in the Sentate on Tuesday. Photo: Andrew Meares \nAn honourable person in his position would quit the Senate and never seek public office again. \nHere's why: Advertisement \nFake senator: He entered Parliament thanks to a disgraceful rule that allows party hacks like him to be chosen by party head office – not grassroots members and certainly not voters – to replace departed senators. Bernardi owes the Liberals for handing him a job worth $300,000 in salary and allowances from June 2006 to July 2008 – and he didn't even have to ask voters. He was part of a long list of similar fakes, with Labor's Sam Dastyari among them. Nuff said. \nAutomatic election: The electoral rules for the Upper House mean the parties decide who gets elected because they choose candidates in the top two or three spots on the party ballot. Bernardi didn't have to campaign much or prove his credentials to voters. He just coasted in on the Liberal ticket. Bernardi was in top spot in 2007 (he became a normal senator in 2008) and 2013. He was in second spot last year. In each case he was elected by many voters none the wiser about who he was or what he'd do. And those who did know could do little to stop him because most people voted above the line for the Liberals which ensured Bernardi would keep suckling at the taxpayer teat – even though he's all for lower taxes. Nuff said. SHARE Link The Trumpesque photo Cory Bernardi posted while on secondment to the UN. \nBetrayal of voters: \"You can't just jump ship and join the other team and claim it's the national or public interest because it's not.\" That was the South Australian senator in 2014 berating a South Australian Liberal colleague. Four years earlier Bernardi said: \"When you change the outcome of an election, you also change the outcome of the policy agenda.\" He has changed the outcome of the 2016 election by adopting a different party and platform than the one voters thought they were getting. Nuff said. \nMoney talks : He bagged the Greens in 2011 for accepting a $1.6 million donation from a rich donor, then asked: \"Why was it that a line of questioning in this chamber by the Greens was directly related to the business interests of the person who made that donation?\" We know, however, that Bernardi loves the Hancock family. He's guffed about them in the Senate, including in 2102 on the 60th anniversary of Lang Hancock's famous flight to find iron ore in Western Australia: \"It … shows the benefits that can come from private enterprise when it is freed from the constraints of government.\" Likewise Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill development in 2014, as reflecting the \"incredible vision and hard work of one of Australia's most successful business builders … It is a matter of some regret that Mrs Rinehart's extraordinary success is not more highly celebrated by members of Parliament.\" Rinehart is still desperate to wield more power through the Parliament. She may well see Bernardi as a way of progressing her world view on lower taxes, mining projects, climate change and northern development. Nuff said. \nFlaky on foreign cash: He rides the Trump/Hanson wagon of nationalism and not being exploited by foreigners. Yet Bernardi overlooked that sentiment – again in relation to Gina Rinehart – when he said this the day before he lauded her vision: \"Without foreign investment in this country, we would not have Roy Hill going ahead … $8 billion worth of foreign investment from financial institutions, plus $3 billion from foreign corporations – investing in something that is going to provide hundreds of millions, possibly tens of billions, of revenue and taxation proceeds for this country.\" Nuff said. \nPerceptions. In 2008 in relation to the Labor policy, he said: \"Often in politics, as in many other fields, the original offence is not a problem but the cover-up that follows the offence destroys careers.\" Bernardi set up the genesis of a new conservative leadership movement well before the 2016 election. It ramped up soon after July 2, even though Bernardi had snuck through as a Liberal candidate. Most Australians were none the wiser. Nuff said. \nUN sojourn: Bernardi has called the United Nations a \"fiscal black hole of bureaucracy\" and an \"unelected and unaccountable body\". Yet he took a three-month freebie to the UN in New York last year – chosen by his senate colleagues, not voters. As Trumpism rose, Bernardi wore a hat carrying the message \"Make Australia Great Again\". Nuff said. \nLiberals under the bus: In his maiden speech he said he would repay the Liberal Party's faith \"by representing my state interests in this chamber while also being mindful of the national interest\". \nEleven years ago Bernardi promised Australians this: \"I shall be guided by my conscience, my family, my country and my God.\" \nVoters can judge him for themselves. \nSuch is life …", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:27:08.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
