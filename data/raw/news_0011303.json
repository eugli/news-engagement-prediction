He was in Los Angeles for the premiere of 50 Shades Darker on Thursday and may well still be there promoting it. And her minder came, too: The 21-year-old model completed her ensemble with an olive green jacket with a faux fur collar that she wore over a sweater of a similar hue and black ankle boots The 24-year-old Brit recorded the sexy movie's theme with Gigi's pal Taylor Swift. Alternatively, he may have been at a Super Bowl viewing party with pals to see the Atlanta Falcons take on the New England Patriots, although American football is not so popular in the UK as it is in the US. Gigi recently discussed her relationship with the former One Direction star in British Vogue , which she covered for March. Stepping out: Gigi's minder was by her side when she got out of the car 'When Iâ€™m in LA I mostly stay in because it's my time off and I like being with my boyfriend and doing art and cooking,' she revealed. 'We like late-night movies and we order from this amazing place that does lattes and gingerbread cookies. I need coffee to stay up. 'I'm always like, \"Babe, let's go to a movie.\" Then I fall asleep halfway through and he's like, \"You've seen the first half of every movie out there and you have no idea how any of them end.\"' No beau: There was no sign of Gigi's rocker boyfriend, Zayn Malik, on Sunday.
