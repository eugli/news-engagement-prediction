Kelly will be in the awkward position of defending the execution of a directive he didn’t see until the week it was issued and wasn’t told was coming until the day before it was signed. \nIn the meantime, travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries targeted by Trump’s temporary ban — Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen — hurried to board flights to the U.S. during what might be a brief window to enter the country while challenges to the president’s order are heard in federal appeals court. \nA lawsuit attempting to overturn Trump’s travel ban appears to be on the fast track to the Supreme Court; judges on the San Francisco-based U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled arguments for Tuesday. \nThe chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), advised Trump on the travel restrictions late last year after Trump was elected and defended the president’s decision to implement them. But McCaul has criticized how the orders were carried out. Brian Bennett \nWhen President Trump ordered a vast overhaul of immigration law enforcement during his first week in office, he stripped away most restrictions on who should be deported, opening the door for roundups and detentions on a scale not seen in nearly a decade. \nUp to 8 million people in the country illegally... \nWhen President Trump ordered a vast overhaul of immigration law enforcement during his first week in office, he stripped away most restrictions on who should be deported, opening the door for roundups and detentions on a scale not seen in nearly a decade. \nUp to 8 million people in the country illegally... (Brian Bennett) \n“It is clear adjustments are needed,” McCaul said in a statement last week. “In the future, such policy changes should be better coordinated with the agencies implementing them and with Congress to ensure we get it right — and don’t undermine our nation’s credibility while trying to restore it.” \nThe internal watchdog for the Department of Homeland Security began investigating the implementation of the order last week. \nAppearing before McCaul’s panel, Kelly will also face questions about Trump’s instructions to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and how the administration intends to pay for it. Costs have been estimated at $12 billion to $38 billion. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:07:03.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
