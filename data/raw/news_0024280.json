Two teams will advance to a 32-team knockout round from each three-nation group. “I think all 16 can qualify for the second round,” Ceferin said. \nRead more | FIFA World Cup’s expansion to 48 teams makes Asian football bosses happy \nFIFA plans to confirm continental entry quotas for the 2026 World Cup at meetings in Bahrain in May. If UEFA’s requests are accepted by FIFA, it will ensure no all-European matches in the 12-day group stage at the 2026 tournament. \nAt the 2014 World Cup, the opening round of group games included the Netherlands routing defending champion Spain 5-1, Italy beating England 2-1, and eventual winner Germany beating Portugal 4-0. \nCeferin announced planned reforms for UEFA five months after he was elected to succeed Michel Platini, who was banned by FIFA for a financial conflict of interest.

Future candidates for elected positions should also have active roles at their national federation, Ceferin suggested. \nThose roles include president, vice president, general secretary or CEO at one of UEFA’s 55 members. \nEthical clause to be added \nUEFA also wants to add a commitment to ethical values in its statutory rules, which can be updated at its annual congress on April 5 in Helsinki, Finland. \nUnder Platini’s leadership, which ended over a $2 million payment he received from FIFA in 2011, UEFA had no formal ethical objectives. “Some ethical provisions should be included in the disciplinary code,” Ceferin said. \nCeferin declined to comment on FIFA’s current review of the application by Vitaly Mutko, the Russian deputy prime minister and head of the 2018 World Cup organizing committee, to retain his FIFA Council seat in an election in Helsinki.

We need people who do the work,” the Slovene official said. — UEFA (@UEFA) February 9, 2017 \nUEFA also wants to formalise two seats on its executive committee with full voting rights to nominees from the European Club Association. The observer roles are currently held by Karl-Heinz Rummenigge of Bayern Munich and Andrea Agnelli of Juventus. \nThe leagues’ umbrella group could also be given full representation, Ceferin said. Leaders of the European Professional Football Leagues have threatened to withdraw cooperation with UEFA in a dispute fueled by Champions League changes announced last August. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:53:42.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
