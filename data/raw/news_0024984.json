By Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images. A full-throated chorus has been assembled, under the leadership of Republican concert masters, to mainstream Colorado appellate judge Neil Gorsuch , Donald Trump’s choice to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court. Scholars of varied political leanings have sung Gorsuch’s praises as a person of uncommon intellectual depth and honesty. I’m sure the various testimonials to Gorsuch have been offered in good faith. Gorsuch, by all appearances, is a nice guy—not, so far, a hallmark of the Trump administration—and not a right-wing hack. But nice or not, he is right-wing—very far right in fact—and it’s imperative that Americans understand that. And, therefore, it’s also important that Democrats approach Gorsuch’s confirmation hearing with a calculated strategy that emphasizes two avenues of attack. First, that Gorsuch is filling a seat that by any objective reading of the Constitution belongs to Merrick Garland. Second, that Gorsuch’s views on a host of questions are out of step with a clear majority of the American people. You do not have to take my word that Gorsuch is extremely conservative. In a recent follow-up to an academic study that appeared in 2007, (“The Judicial Common Space,” 23 Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization 303) three scholars— Lee Epstein, Andrew D. Martin, and Kevin Quinn —used various statistical measures to rank Trump’s short-list of potential Supreme Court nominees in order to demonstrate his fidelity to the conservative base of the Republican Party. (The academics’ rankings were released before Gorsuch’s nomination.) Of the 20 judges that Trump had said that he was considering, the political scientists found that only two were more conservative than Gorsuch. Indeed, according to the scale that the scholars employed, Gorsuch came out further to the right than Antonin Scalia. Nor was this the only study placing Gorsuch on the far-right flank of American judicial thought. The New York Times reported that another group of professors has looked at where the money is: that is, the political donations made by federal judges before taking their seats. Using that measure, Gorsuch is more conservative than 87 percent of his colleagues on the federal bench. VIDEO: The Long List of Lawsuits Against Donald Trump Gorsuch’s written views further cement grounds for concern. Gorsuch, who has a doctorate from Oxford, wrote his dissertation on assisted suicide and later published a book on the subject. Since both assisted suicide and abortion involve questions of how much latitude the state should afford an individual in deciding what to do with one’s own body, assisted suicide is an obvious proxy for reproductive choice. In his book, The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia , Gorsuch opposed assisted suicide, repeatedly talking of “the innate value of human life” and declared that “the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong.” Far more significantly, Gorsuch went on to suggest the possibility of a constitutionally enforceable right to life. This is especially alarming for those interested in the continued vitality of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision confirming a woman’s legal right to choose. During the campaign, Trump, in his usual simple-minded proclamations about matters he doesn’t really understand, said repeatedly that overruling Roe was of limited concern, since the matter would simply revert back to the states—meaning that New York, presumably, might legalize abortion while Alabama might not. If Gorsuch, as his writings suggest, finds that life begins at conception—and if the Supreme Court, with Judge Gorsuch aboard, were to issue a ruling that established a constitutional right to life—then a national ban on abortion would be imminent. Gorsuch has always sung loudly from the conservative hymnal. In an article for the conservative journal National Review, written in 2005, before he took the bench, Gorsuch maintained, “American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judge[s] and lawyers, rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education.” His comments echo the dissent in Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 Supreme Court decision that recognized a constitutional right to gay marriage. The justices who voted no said, like Gorsuch, that legislatures, not the court, should have decided the question. Yet what is perhaps even more galling about the article is its rank partisanship. Declaring that liberals have tried to use the courts to accomplish their policy agendas is true. But failing to recognize that conservatives have been equally, if not more guilty of the same thing, is infuriating. The conservative effort to eradicate gun control, to allow for unlimited campaign spending, to overturn Obamacare, have all been conducted in the courthouse, not the ballot box. Indeed, for all his supposed sympathy to legislative judgments, Gorsuch, in the Hobby Lobby case, struck down on grounds of freedom of religion those provisions of the Affordable Care Act that obligated employers to pay for their employees’ contraceptive care. Gorsuch may be polite and likable, but his track record is plainly ideological. Elections have consequences. And among the consequences of being elected president is gaining the right, under Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution to “nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, . . . appoint . . . [j]udges of the Supreme Court . . .” Accordingly, if Trump wanted to name a judge, like Gorsuch—a nominee of high intellectual caliber and proven judicial performance—it would be his prerogative, assuming the Senate was willing to consent to someone whose views were to the far right of those held by most Americans. Unfortunately, though, the Republicans decided to read that provision out of the Constitution last year. The judge that President Obama named, Merrick Garland, was so widely respected, so demonstrably moderate—and, at 64, so old (Gorsuch, who is 49, could serve for generations)—that Senators Mitch McConnell, and Chuck Grassley, the chair of the Judiciary Committee, refused to fulfill the constitutional mandate that they “advise and consent” on the president’s nominee. They simply refused to allow a vote on whether or not to confirm him. Republicans decided that thumbing their nose at the Constitution was better than having to face the voters after turning down someone who, in front of the cameras, would prove so obviously qualified for the job. Confirmation hearings have been derided as Kabuki theater. Senators make grandstanding speeches but do a poor job of questioning the nominees. And the nominees generally try to avoid saying anything of consequence by refusing, on ethical grounds, to comment on issues that are likely to come before the court (purportedly to avoid the appearance of prejudgment on those questions). So how should the Gorsuch hearings be handled in this contentious climate? To make meaningful use of the Gorsuch confirmation hearing, Democrats will have to demonstrate traits that Republicans are long accustomed to displaying: coordination, forethought, and disciplined deployment of their strategy. In particular, they should have two principal goals. First, they should conduct the Garland confirmation hearing in the course of the Gorsuch hearing. And second, they should use Gorsuch’s previous remarks as an avenue to force him to acknowledge views that are far more extreme than those of most Americans. Here’s what I mean about conducting the Garland confirmation hearing within the Gorsuch hearing. In 2002, after the death of the late Supreme Court Justice Byron White (another Coloradoan for whom Gorsuch clerked before he worked with Justice Kennedy), Gorsuch wrote an article for U.P.I lamenting the politicization of the judicial confirmation process in the U.S. Senate. He wrote: \nToday, there are too many who are concerned less with promoting the best public servants and more with enforcing litmus tests . . . likely to advance favored political causes once on the bench. \nPoliticians and pressure groups on both sides declare that they will not support nominees unless they hew to their own partisan creeds. When a favored candidate is voted down for lack of sufficient political sympathy to those in control, grudges are held for years, and retaliation is guaranteed. \nWhatever else might be said about the process today, excellence plainly is no longer the dispositive virtue. As a case in point, Gorsuch acknowledged two nominees who had been “grossly mistreated” by the Senate as they awaited confirmation to the D.C. Circuit. One was John Roberts, now the chief justice of the United States. But Gorsuch’s prime example was Garland himself. “Both were Supreme Court clerks,” Gorsuch noted. “Both served with distinction at the Department of Justice. Both are widely considered to be among the finest lawyers of their generation. Garland, a Clinton appointee, was actively promoted by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah . . . Garland was left waiting for 18 months before being confirmed over the opposition of 23 senators.” (All, by the way, were Republicans, who wanted to begin a rear-guard action against Garland, clearly a Supreme Court justice-in-waiting.) Democrats must confront Gorsuch with his prior declarations about the intense and inappropriate politicization of the confirmation process, and do it in the manner of deft cross-examiners. They must force him to eat every word, one by one, before the American people. They should then move on to Garland’s 10-month limbo, ostensibly as a way to assess Gorsuch’s views of the proper role of the Supreme Court in particular, and his own views about good judging. Here is a possible line of questioning: Judge Gorsuch, do you still agree that Merrick Garland is among the finest lawyers of his generation? In your opinion has Merrick Garland been an outstanding judge of the D.C. Circuit? In your view are you a better judge than Merrick Garland? Do you have the same length of service as Judge Garland on the appellate court? (No) Have you, like Judge Garland, served as the chief judge of the Circuit on which you sit? (No) Is the D.C .Circuit, commonly referred to as the second most important court in the country? Do you know of any basis, Judge Gorsuch, as you evaluate your own performance as a judge by which you are more qualified than Merrick Garland to sit on the United States Supreme Court? If Gorsuch is the sort of honest intellect that his supporters claim, he will be forced to concede Garland’s qualifications. For that reason, I expect Republicans will try to rule these questions about Garland somehow out of order. Democrats should stick to their guns. If blocked, they should get up and leave and boycott the confirmation process thereafter. If the hearings go on, then Democrats should insist that Gorsuch answer questions about his own personal beliefs. Once again, he has given them an unusual opportunity to do so. After the death of Justice Scalia, Gorsuch appeared at Case Western Reserve Law School to deliver a scholarly address. He was slated to talk about the mess that has become of civil litigation. Instead, he used the occasion to deliver a paean to Scalia and to outline his own philosophy of decision-making. Gorsuch is a canny guy, clearly. He knew that his young age, among other factors, would make him a serious candidate for the Supreme Court if the Republicans were to win the presidency. His article was little more than a brief to the Senate Judiciary Committee, pointing out how even-handed and measured he’d be as a Justice. But in the process, Gorsuch boxed himself in. Judges, he insisted, “should be in the business of declaring what the law is, using the traditional tools of interpretation, rather than pronouncing the law as they might wish it to be in light of their own political views . . .” Because Gorsuch maintained that he—like Scalia—rules on judicial questions without regard to his personal beliefs, those beliefs, according to his own catechism, would not control how he would rule on the cases before him. Thus, his beliefs are fair game for questioning, because the senators, like most of us, know that political beliefs do impact judges’ votes on hard questions. Democrats again should feed his words back to him and press him repeatedly to answer whether he, personally, believes in man-made climate change, when he believes life begins, and whether, in his view, federal administrative agencies have too much power. He will try to dance away, and they should continue to demand answers. Again, if he won’t respond, they should leave. In the long run, the Democrats have no power to block Gorsuch, except in the unlikely event that a solid majority of Americans comes to view anyone but Garland in Scalia’s seat as an affront to the Constitution. Accordingly, I see absolutely nothing to be gained by playing nice with Republicans. There is no advantage in acceding to Gorsuch because of the threat that Republicans will change Senate rules and eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court candidates. The Republicans’ might makes right approach suggests that they will eliminate the filibuster whenever they need to in order to get a nominee confirmed. In effect, the filibuster is already gone. By choosing dramatic moves in the confirmation process, the Democrats would be demonstrating to Americans two underlying truths: that the Republicans have chosen power over principle, and that Gorsuch, whatever his qualifications, will never be a legitimate justice of the Supreme Court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T15:30:56.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
