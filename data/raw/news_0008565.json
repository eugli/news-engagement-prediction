Article continues below \nSpeaking ahead of the game, the Frenchman discussed Chelsea's strengths and highlighted one player in particular: N'Golo Kante. \nWenger is a long-term admirer of his compatriot and claims he has made a \"huge impact\" since signing for Â£32 million last summer. Article continues below Pep Guardiola ready to offload Sergio Aguero to European giants [Mirror] \n\"N'Golo Kante has made a huge impact in that team,\" he said, per The Sun . \"It is not a coincidence they are in the position they are and Leicester were in that position last year. \n\"Maybe that defeat to us was a wake-up call, they have changed things in the right way, they have benefited by not being in Europe. \n\"That has given [Antonio] Conte time to prepare and to get to know better the players. The integration of Kante has had a huge impact.\" \nAnd yet it could have been so different. \nIn the same interview, Wenger revealed how he's twice tried to bring Kante to Arsenal and, surprise surprise, appeared to blame his failings on money. \nWhen asked about his previous attempts to sign Kante, he replied: \"When he was in France, when he was at Leicester. \n\"We cannot explain everything, but it is quite obvious when you look at where he has gone. I do not want to talk more about that. Transfers are transfers.\" \nKante's importance to Chelsea was perfectly summed up by some pretty incredible statistics during Wednesday's 1-1 draw away to Liverpool. \nThe 25-year-old made 14 tackles at Anfield - more than any player in a single game this season - had 70 touches and made five five blocks. \nAnd as if that wasn't enough, Kante also created one goalscoring opportunity from defensive midfield. \nHow Wenger must regret not signing him, especially so following Aaron Ramsey's diabolical performance against Watford. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
