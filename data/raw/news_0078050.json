The Home Office rescinded Shiromini's deportation order on Monday. \nShiromini Satkunarajah, who is studying electrical engineering at Bangor University, faced being sent to her country of birth with her mother Roshina on Tuesday morning. \nThe Home Office rescinded her deportation order on Monday, shortly after her local MP Hywel Williams raised a point of order in the House of Commons. \nMiss Satkunarajah and her mother were due to be released from Yarl's Wood Detention Centre on Monday evening.

So much has been achieved in so little time. \nThe outpouring of support from across the country has been staggering, particularly from North Wales where Shiromini is highly regarded within the Bangor community. \nSince the campaign was launched on Friday I've received messages of support for Shiromini from across the country and I'm glad that Bangor University will now be able to welcome one of their best students back. \nOf course the campaign to right this unjust situation is not over. There is clearly something seriously wrong with the current system and it is an issue I intend to pursue. – Hywel Williams MP, Plaid Cymru, Arfon Last updated Tue 28 Feb 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:05:30.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
