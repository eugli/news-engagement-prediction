(ABC News: Felicity Ogilvie) \n\"When we moved here we became aware it was a high fire risk area and we were aware of the 1967 bushfires,\" Ms Magraith said. \nThe concrete bunker took more than a year to build and has emergency supplies plus a medical air cylinder. \n\"People need to take responsibility for what they're going to do,\" she said. \n\"If it's not safe to leave early, if there's a lot of smoke on the roads or the potential for trees down or accidents, then we can stay here and we can stay safe here.\" \nIn Tasmania, the construction of private bushfire shelters must adhere to strict building codes. \nThe Tasmania Fire Service said it did not support or recommend their use. Current generations urged not to forget past \nA fire ecologist has warned Tasmanians to take the risk of major bushfire events more seriously to avoid a repeat of the devastation. Photo: Remember the past and plan for the future, Professor Bowman says. (ABC News: Elise Fantin) \nUniversity of Tasmania professor David Bowman said today's anniversary was a reminder of the need to fire-proof areas. \n\"Fifty years is a long time ago, it's very easy to forget 1967 ever happened or it was something that was ancient history, it's grandparents' time,\" he said. \n\"I'm concerned that the message still has not cut through to the general population.\" Half a century on from Tasmania's worst natural disaster, take a look back at the causes of the fires and what we have learnt since. \nProfessor Bowman said the community had to embrace more intensive land management. \n\"Certainly, the fire managers and the policy makers for fire and disaster management understand the risk, there's no question of that,\" he said. \nHe said the community lacked a desire for reform. \n\"It's the hunger in the community to see real change, to make all of our bushland cities fire proof [and] fire safe. There's not a community hunger,\" he said. \n\"Having an appreciation in the community for planned burning, fuel management, mechanical clearing, possibly more radical interventions using animals to eat fuel. \n\"Also having a bushfire plan, clearing around the house and also more importantly retrofitting houses to be compliant.\" Study reinforces need to be fire ready \nNew research led by Professor Bowman has been published in the scientific journal Nature Ecology and Evolution today. \nResearchers based in Australia and overseas created a database of 23 million fires over a 12-year period and then analysed the top 478 extreme fire events. \nThe study found extremely intense fires were linked to anomalous weather events including droughts and winds. \nProfessor Bowman said nearly a third of the events looked at occurred in regions where humans had built into flammable forested landscapes. ABC Emergency has sourced advice from official agencies on how to plan for a bushfire emergency, including preparing a survival kit and what to do before, during and after a disaster. \n\"Using climate change model projections to investigate the likely consequences of climate change, the research found more extreme fires are predicted in the future for Australia's east coast, including Brisbane, and the whole of the Mediterranean region,\" he said. \n\"The projections suggest an increase in the days conducive to extreme wildfire events by 20 to 50 per cent in these disaster-prone landscapes, with sharper increases in the subtropical southern hemisphere, and the European Mediterranean Basin. \n\"Our paper reinforces the major research and policy challenge of finding ways to optimise human community resilience to wildland fires and effectively live with landscapes prone to support extreme fire events.\" \nProfessor Bowman has previously warned an event like the 1967 bushfires would happen again. \n\"Unfortunately for Tasmania we have the right mix for extreme events, the right population density, the right climate, the right vegetation,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:45:51.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
