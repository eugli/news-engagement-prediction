(WFLA) \nWhen the former police officer returned to the theater, Oulson yelled at him, according to Vivian Reeves. \n\"You told on me,\" she recalled Oulson as saying, according to ABC News. \"Who the f--- do you think you are?\" \nRetired Fla. police captain charged with fatal movie theater shooting released on bail \nShe said in court that \"it happened very quickly, and his whole upper body just came forward, and I thought that he was coming over,\" according to ABC News. \nVivian Reeves testified that she heard shots.
