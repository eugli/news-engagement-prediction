The Kenyan government had hoped to close Dadaab by the end of November, but as the day approached, the registered refugees living there were given a six-month extension.\nThe Kenyan government has vowed to fight the ruling and close down the camp — which they say has become a recruiting ground for terrorists.\nDadaab is home to more than 275,000 people, many of whom were displaced after fleeing the Somali civil war in 1991. If the camp were to shut down, the refugees would effectively be homeless and stateless.\nSo where does a population larger than that of 11 African capital cities go? VICE News reports from the camp and speaks to the people facing an uncertain future.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Kenya", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Fkenya-may-close-the-worlds-largest-refugee-camp-over-fear-of-terrorist-activity"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:23:59.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
