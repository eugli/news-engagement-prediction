Wenger has confirmed he will opt for Ospina over Cech (Picture: Getty) \n‘I don’t get this. Cech’s your best goalkeeper. Do you want to win the competition or not?’ Ferdinand told BTSport. \n‘Play your best goalkeeper. When the keeper changes it throws things out – no matter who he is. \n‘You’re used to playing with your number one goalkeeper, which is Cech every week. The centre halves immediately will be thinking “there’s something different behind me” and it creates uncertainty.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:47:26.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
