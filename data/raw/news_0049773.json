The evil clown has existed in the realm of DC comic books for decades, and he has continuously popped up to make Batman's life hell for the entirety of his career. He is a character whose comic book history dates back almost a full century, and Zach Galifianakis' recent portrayal of the character in The LEGO Batman Movie hammers home the iconography and history behind this sinister being. \nWith that in mind, we have decided to take it upon ourselves to go through the major film portrayals of the Clown Prince of Crime and figure out which version of The Joker is the best. There's no definitive way to handle this character, and plenty of performers and filmmakers have tried different approaches over the years. With that in mind, let's kick this list off with the worst (and most recent) portrayal of the iconic villain in a major movie. 6. Jared Leto \nI'm not quite sure where to begin with this one because Jared Leto's Joker in Suicide Squad was an absolute let down. There's absolutely no menace to the character, and none of his flamboyance feels backed up by any evil, malice, or insanity. He just seems like somebody took Capt. Jack Sparrow and painted Johnny Depp's rum-obsessed pirate white and green. I'm not sure if it was Leto, David Ayer , or the folks at DC who misunderstood Joker going into Suicide Squad (maybe it's a combination of all three), but the Task Force X team-up movie simply did almost nothing right with him. As of right now, Jared Leto remains the DCEU's resident evil clown, so let's hope this can change by the time he makes his next appearance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:04:06.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
