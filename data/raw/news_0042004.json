The artiste seems to have accomplished that with his newest album, Punjab, in which he addresses issues that have plagued the state for over a decade. \nThe album’s title track, which talks about the problems in the region, seems to have resonated with millions, with the video getting more than 9 million views on YouTube in the week since its launch. \nWatch the song here: \nSpeaking about the single, the 60-year-old singer says that people nowadays watch songs instead of listening to them. “People remember what they see. I got positive reviews from people for this song because they could see Punjab in the video and they were happy about it.” Read more Five facts about Lata Mangeshkar every fan must know \nHowever, the music video also seem to have attracted negative comments amid speculation that it takes a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But Maan refutes the speculation, saying, “We haven’t made any jibes of any kind at anyone. In fact, the reference to Delhi is about honouring and celebrating Delhi’s role in our history.” \nWhen asked why he released the video after the Punjab state elections and not before, the singer said, “I had announced the release date of my album [February 9] on November 2 last year, on my social media profiles. At that time, the election dates were not even announced. Also, as the brand ambassador of the Election Commission for the Punjab elections, one of my main duties was to encourage people to vote. It had to be free from any political bearing or inclination whatsoever.” We haven’t made any jibes of any kind at anyone. In fact, the reference to Delhi is about honouring and celebrating Delhi’s role in our history. - Gurdas Maan \nMaan, who has also sung several Punjabi songs for the Hindi film industry, believes that Punjabi folk music is relevant in the broader, more commercial music industry. “Punjabi songs hold a lot of relevance today, be it in a Hindi film or a regional language film. Punjabi music and instruments such as dhol, alghoza and tumbi, and the presence of music created with these instruments even in English movies, is a big deal. There are no boundaries now.” Maan also believes that Punjabi folk music can never go out of fashion due to the nature of its composition. “This is folk music, and folk music cannot be overshadowed. Whenever someone plays this genre anywhere, we feel connected to it, because the composition itself is brilliant. People start chanting these songs like a prayer. A folk song in any language will inspire you,” he explains. Gurdas Maan, Udit Narayan and Lata Mangeshkar sang the song ‘Aisa des hai mera’ from the movie Veer-Zaara (2004). (HT Photo) \nWhen asked about the current trend in Bollywood where old songs are remixed and presented in a new light, he says the fusion of the old and new in such songs is very appealing. However, he holds that the original creators should be credited. “It is important to acknowledge people who have made a song before remaking it.” Ask him if he wishes any of his songs to be remade, and he replies in affirmative. However, there’s a caveat: “We don’t want anybody else to remake our songs, we will do it. We are looking at some of the opportunities,” he says. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:15.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
