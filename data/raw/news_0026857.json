PUBLISHED: 07:30, Tue, Feb 14, 2017 | UPDATED: 07:35, Tue, Feb 14, 2017 GETTY Labour Baroness Shami Chakrabarti and former lawyer Phil Shiner \nTheir stories illustrate just how the Left has driven itself into electoral oblivion. \nMr Shiner was once lauded by large swathes of the media, the legal establishment and the Left as a model modern lawyer taking on the powerful and fighting for the powerless. \nToday that always-ludicrous myth is destroyed.

Troops hounded on the back of lies Stephen Pollard \nIt is a modern political parable that exposes the sand on which so much of the human rights obsessed, nation-hating Left’s dogma is built. \nNow consider Baroness Chakrabarti. Shami, as she has almost always been called by her chattering-class groupies, rose to prominence as the director of Liberty, the supposed civil liberties pressure group. \nSupposed because somehow her organisation only ever appeared to be concerned with the civil liberties of figures who wanted to undermine our security and who fitted the modern Left’s definition of a deserving cause.

Speaking on Sunday she told us how upset she is at Mr Shiner’s downfall. \nHe had, she said, done “very good work” before “losing his way”. \nHow telling this is about her world view. She believes not only that Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party must be protected from the accusation that it harbours anti-Semites but also that Phil Shiner must be protected from the idea that he is a nasty piece of work who deserves everything that has come to him. \nThis is the man, remember, whose grotesquely misnamed firm Public Interest Lawyers (PIL) trousered more than £4million of taxpayers’ money. Utilising our credulous legal aid system and the unerring capacity of the establishment to do the work of its enemies, Mr Shiner constructed an entire legal eco-system of allegations and inquiries to reward his firm’s baseless accusations of war crimes. GETTY Jeremy Corbyn handed Baroness Chakrabarti a Labour peerage \nHe pretended to be a heroic human rights defender working to redress terrible wrongs done to Iraqi and Afghan civilians. In reality he was involved in using representatives in Baghdad and Basra to tout for clients who would be prepared to say they had been abused by British soldiers. \nBut in December 2014 the judge-led inquiry into allegations that a group of Iraqi farmers had been murdered by British soldiers found that many of the so-called witnesses were lying. The claims were “wholly without foundation and entirely the product of deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility”. \nPIL pocketed £3million from the inquiry which cost taxpayers £31million. The entire edifice was built on lies. \nLast week Sir Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, confirmed that the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (which has so far spent £60million investigating British troops) will be closed down . The vast majority of its cases were brought by Mr Shiner’s firm PIL. \nUntil the judge’s ruling in 2014, he was repeatedly lauded, not least by Baroness Chakrabarti in her former role at Liberty, where she made him their human rights lawyer of the year in 2004. \nLiberty praised his “outstanding skill and tenacity in taking test cases to protect the rights of Iraqi civilians tortured and killed by British forces”. GETTY Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon confirmed that the IHAT will be closed down Iraq pull-out Play slideshow 1 of 42 Members of 15 Squadron RAF Regiment on one of the last patrols during combat operations by the British in Basra \nIn 2007 Rabinder Singh QC, who was PIL’s counsel in many of its Iraq cases, said: “Most of the time my honest view about lawyers is that we should be modest about what we contribute to justice but Phil Shiner is an exception to that rule. \n“If there were no Phil Shiners in the country then the sort of legal issues arising out of the Iraq war I don’t think would have surfaced.” \nSir Rabinder Singh is now a high court judge. The Law Society itself honoured Mr Shiner in 2007 as their solicitor of the year. \nIndeed, even after the Iraq Inquiry collapsed, some on the Left simply refused to accept it. \nOne Left-wing newspaper even claimed he had been the subject of a “vendetta” by the government and media. The interlinked careers of Baroness Chakrabarti and Mr Shiner perfectly illustrate the wrong turn taken by Labour in recent years. \nMost natural Labour supporters will be as outraged by Baroness Chakrabarti’s outlook and behaviour as they are by Phil Shiner’s. And the irony of her leaping to the defence of a man who used human rights law to enable his wrongdoing will surely not be lost on anyone.
