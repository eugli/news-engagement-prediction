We needed it.” \n“I think it’s good news,” Mario Crivello added. “I think we still need to pay attention to our water usage and not be wasteful. Hopefully this drought was a lesson learned.” \nAccording to the U.S. Drought Monitor , this time last year, 63 percent of the state was in either in extreme or exceptional drought. As of this week, that number is down to just under 2 percent. \nThis comes as the State Water Resources Control Board is set to vote Wednesday on whether to keep California in a drought state of emergency. \nThe MWDOC concedes Orange County remains in a drought, just not an emergency one. \n“It defies logic to tell the public – to force water agencies to tell the public – that we are still in a drought emergency,” said Wayne Osborne, president of the MWDOC Board of Directors, in a news release. “We remain in a drought, but it is no longer an emergency. Not only is it unnecessary, continuing the ‘emergency’ will destroy local leaders’ credibility with their stakeholders.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:00:31.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
