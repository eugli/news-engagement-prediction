Martin Golden (R-Brooklyn) said he was “amazed” an “admitted gang member” wasn’t turned over to federal authorities. \n“When ICE has a detainer on a illegal immigrant with a criminal record, they should be turned over to the federal government — no questions asked,” he said. “The low lives who are committing crimes — get them out of here.” \nDecker said the city’s policy is “creating a potentially unsafe environment for its residents.” \n“ICE remains steadfast in solidifying its relationship with local law enforcement in the interest of public safety and national security,” he added. \nA spokesperson for ICE could not offer additional details on Velasquez’s criminal history, including when and where he’s been arrested. \nAdditional reporting by Danika Fears ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:22:08.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
