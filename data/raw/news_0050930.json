(Brian O'Mahoney/News-Sun) Aaron Lawlor speaks during a groundbreaking ceremony for a new Healing Garden at the Lake County Children's Advocacy Center, July 26, 2016. (Brian O'Mahoney/News-Sun) (Brian O'Mahoney / Lake County News-Sun) Luke Hammill News-Sun Privacy Policy \nIn the wake of what they called \"reports about incidents of hate, intimidation and division in Lake County,\" local leaders on Tuesday morning held an event promoting tolerance at the College of Lake County in Grayslake, where they told stories of fear among minority communities and brainstormed ways to be more inclusive. \nAt the end of the event, Lake County Board Chairman Aaron Lawlor wanted to address \"how to transform words into action,\" he said later. \nSo he took significant action himself. \nIn his remarks to the audience, he noted that, \"While Illinois has significant protections for those individuals in our LGBT community, under federal law you can still be denied renting an apartment because you are gay. You can still be denied financing or a mortgage for a house, because you are gay. You can be fired from your job solely on the purpose that you are gay.\" \nHe used the federal policy as an example of the work that is still left to do on civil rights in the United States. And then he asked the crowd to think about, \"What would happen if we didn't have that Illinois law? \n\"Who in your life would that impact? â€¦ Maybe a neighbor, maybe a family member, maybe it's a co-worker that you know; a classmate here at CLC,\" Lawlor said. \"It could even be your County Board chairman.\" \nAfter the event, Lawlor, 34, said in a phone interview that he \"meant to share with the audience that I'm gay.\" \nLawlor said he has \"never hid\" or \"lied about\" his sexual orientation. He has lobbied in the past for marriage equality and has been active with groups like Equality Illinois, a group advocating for LGBT rights, he said. But Tuesday's remarks were the first time he publicly acknowledged his sexual orientation in a political setting. \n\"It's all about making sure Lake County is an inclusive and welcoming place,\" Lawlor said. \"And that starts with understanding each other and understanding our differences, and making them into strengths.\" \nLawlor, a Republican, joined the County Board in 2009 and was elected chairman in 2012, becoming the youngest ever elected to that position. His district includes Vernon Hills and Indian Creek, plus portions of Hawthorn Woods, Long Grove, Mundelein and unincorporated Lake County. He has never married and does not have children, he said. \n\"I hope it added value to the discussion,\" Lawlor said of his remarks. \"I think it did, by the response that I'm getting.\" \nThe two-hour event centered on promoting tolerance and unity, and leaders were asked to sign a pledge to, \"make Lake County an inclusive and welcoming community.\" While Lawlor and Lake County State's Attorney Mike Nerheim, who helped organize the event, both said that prejudice, hateful rhetoric and bullying were not new phenomena, they both acknowledged the role of the national political climate in magnifying those issues. \n\"It did seem very divisive,\" Nerheim said of November's presidential election. \"I think all elections can be divisive, but this one seemed particularly divisive.\" \nLooming over the event was the controversy surrounding the presidency of Donald Trump . While the discussion was not specifically about Trump, panel members such as Megan McKenna Mejia, executive director of the Round Lake Park-based immigrant resource nonprofit Mano a Mano, spoke about, \"a recent increase in fear and anxiety in the community.\" \nTrump has moved to aggressively change federal immigration policy, ran on a platform suggesting he would deport immigrants who didn't have permission to be in the country and pledged to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico. \nTrump himself on Tuesday condemned recent threats targeting the Jewish community, calling them \"horrible\" and \"a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,\" the Washington Post reported. He also toured the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, and said it was a \"meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms.\" \nMany criticized Trump's remarks throughout the presidential campaign as intended to appeal to prejudice toward immigrants, Muslims and other minorities. \nNerheim said there has been, \"an increase in incidents around Lake County\" related to such issues. But he acknowledged most of the reports have been anecdotal. \n\"There's been fear in our Latino community and our Muslim community,\" he said. \nThe event was also hosted by the Partnership for a Safer Lake County, a group of organizations and individuals \"committed to ending violence in Lake County,\" according to a county news release. \n\"The partnership will combat violence of all kinds, including child abuse, elder abuse, sexual assault, human trafficking, LGBTQ crimes and domestic violence,\" the news release reads. \"It is something that must be done, and cannot be done working alone.\" \nLawlor said he hopes his comments about his sexual orientation help encourage Lake County residents to embrace both the similarities and the differences between them and their neighbors. \n\"I haven't hidden it, so why is there a need to do a big, flashy announcement?\" Lawlor said of the reason he never talked about being gay so publicly before. \"I think it's better and more impactful for me to talk about it in this setting, and on this topic.\" \nTwitter @lucashammill", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:34:07.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
