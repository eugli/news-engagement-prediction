Earlier, it happened in 2014 when some students were given easy access to the question paper prior to exam and later on FPSC ordered re-examination in Faisalabad,” said Zunaira, another candidate. She said the FPSC should reconduct the exam as if this scam proves true, it would give unfair advantage to some students and it would be injustice to the others. \nEarlier, a news item appeared in the press about availability of guess/questions papers on social media relating to two compulsory papers of CSS-2017 examination. It has been alleged that the actual questions in the papers were quite similar. \nThe candidates emphasised the need to develop strong and foolproof mechanisms to maintain secrecy and confidentiality of question papers and other related information at the FPSC. \nThey opined certain quarters might be making an attempt to cast aspersions on the working of the FPSC .The matter had been taken seriously by the commission and accordingly referred to Federal Investigation Agency to probe and investigate the matter. \nFIA Director General ordered to launch an investigation into CSS paper leak scam. Officials claim a woman leaked the CSS examination questions on social networking site facebook some 20 days before the exam date. \nThey revealed the woman leaked English paper on January 26, while the assessment was held on February 16. The woman also mentioned two queries of current affairs paper on January 31. \nThe questions asked in CSS examination were same which she wrote on her account. It was learnt that a group had been releasing secret information regarding FPSC and was charging Rs30,000 to Rs80,000 from individuals for such services. \nOn the other hand, senior bureaucrats said they will soon unearth the reality behind the scam. \nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 28 th , 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:58:23.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
