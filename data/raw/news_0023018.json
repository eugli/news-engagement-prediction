Credit Natalie Keyssar for The New York Times Fairies can be so fickle. One night, all you want to do is break a spell. The next, with ice in your veins and a malicious flourish, you put a curse into action. On Thursday, Sara Mearns , the glamorous New York City Ballet principal, made an unlikely debut: the evil Fairy Carabosse in “ The Sleeping Beauty .” Her usual role, which she performed Wednesday, is the Lilac Fairy, Princess Aurora’s shimmering protector who counteracts Carabosse’s curse of death.

Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, where she danced the role of the Fairy Carabosse for the first time Thursday night in New York City Ballet’s “The Sleeping Beauty.” Credit Natalie Keyssar for The New York Times Ms. Mearns , 31, is no polite ballerina, but an all-or-nothing dancer who reacts on the spot through her deep connection with music. Speaking twice in her dressing room on Thursday — once during intermission and later after her brief, ferocious appearance in the second act — Ms. Mearns reflected on the two roles. “Carabosse is like spitfire — short and sweet,” she said. “With the Lilac Fairy, I feel very empowered. You’re sort of in charge of the whole extravaganza. You’re always there.” After a parting hug so she could take her bow — “Don’t get caught in the wing,” she said, referring not to the stage but to the appendage on her glittering black dress — she headed back out. For the record, the crowd roared. Ms. Mearns grinned with delight. Photo Ms. Mearns having fingernails applied for her role as the Fairy Carabosse.

I wanted her to be the Maleficent Disney [animated] version where she just stands there. She’s actually somewhat nice and doesn’t scream in the beginning. Peter [ Martins , the ballet master in chief] told me: “Carabosse is just as beautiful as the Lilac Fairy. You should be above it all. But what’s different is that your soul is evil.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Your rage seemed to bubble up inside of you. Is that what it felt like? Yes. I actually didn’t think that was going to happen! When I’ve seen people do that, I’ve been like, there’s no way that I could get myself to do that. I would feel so stupid. And then when I got onstage, there was no one standing in front of me. I was just like, oh my God, this feels right. Photo Morphing into an evil fairy. Credit Natalie Keyssar for The New York Times What did you not want Carabosse to be? I didn’t want to come out screaming like a crazy person. I feel like I have a really different approach. The music makes you want to go there because it’s so powerful — it makes you want to scream. The costume does it. You just standing there already does it. You just have to rein it in. It was hard, but once I really committed to the way I was going to do it, I felt comfortable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:57:53.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
