Josh Oberg \nI agree with both sides T-Mobile should just be the bigger ” person” and truly offer their customers a good solution with less of the corporate gimmicks. However, they were already cheaper than Verizon and they are still cheaper. But cut the antics. Internally tmo sent out a comparison, that showed the existing plans were fine basically, but the. Realized they weren’t and had to react . Tyler Shortt \nIsn’t that how competition works? Or haggling? Can’t throw it all in there otherwise you got nothing left to “one up” them with… I’m glad Verizon did this though, T-Mobile’s BS was getting a little annoying (even though I’m on one of the pre-ONE unlimited plans) SpectralRaiden \nWtf kind of Xanatos speed chess is being played here😨 Chris \nHell yeah, I was hoping this would happen because of Verizon’s plans. Now it’s a battle for the best “truly” unlimited (hopefully). Droid 1967 \nlets hope they fight it out down to 10 bucks a month 🙂 warsaw \nI’m kind of interested in this two line plan promo for $100. Me and a buddy currently have the simple choice 10GB promo they offered back last summer and barely use more than 3GB a piece. End up paying about $110 with taxes and line charges. I wonder if there will be any differences between the simple choice plan and this? Honestly I would prefer they just offer that 2 line 6GB for $70 or $80 they used to have as I don’t really care about unlimited data but do care about ways to save money. Ben \nThe contents of that Tweet-storm = “T-Mobile got caught with their pants down” guest \n2 lines like this for $100? Thats almost enough to pry me from my VZW Unlimited. If i dont like it I can go back to VZW. not bad. Alex \n“In the end, one has to ask why Legere didn’t just start with all of this setup this way instead of having to always react? Why wait until your competitors do it, John?” \nWhy should he? He was the best on the market. When he wasn’t, he adjusted. It’s market competition. Everyone wins. It’s not a charity, it’s a business. Kellex B \nBecause Legere parades around as if he’s performing some level of justice to the wireless industry with the changes he makes. But instead, he often makes changes to see what he can get away with and for how long before everyone else takes him on. At that point, he then reacts to whoever outmatched him under this act as if he’s once again doing the world a big favor. It’s a terrible look. I’d much prefer he drop the social justice warrior scheme and just act like a business. MadMartigan \nIsn’t this how business works? Fighting over customers, one-upping each-other to get business? \nGiving it all away day-one would ruin any business. No-one does that. Why would they? Like ’em or hate ’em, T-Mobile started this one-up-man-ship and got the others fighting over us. All good in my book. zepfloyd \nIt’s not that it’s how business works, it’s the OPTICS of how he does it. It’s the same game since the dawn of capitalism. Just the self back patting he does when he does it that just comes across as severely hypocritical. It’s like trying to wave the anti establishment campaign railing against the man, but really operating just like the man. I think it’s humorous that more don’t see it. MadMartigan \n“OPTICS” \nOh for the love of…it’s called PR; otherwise known as Marketing. It’s not new, so why give it a new name?? \nIt’s not that “we don’t see it”…it’s that we get it. It’s PR. That’s all well and good, it is what it is. But what the business side of it has done is change the entire game of how carriers in the US attract customers. It brought T-Mobile up to 3rd. It caused Verizon to re-offer Unlimited Data. Do you really think they’d be doing this if T-Mo were still 4th place and the whole ‘uncarrier’ PR campaign had never happened??? zepfloyd \nMaybe they would. The bigger landscape hasn’t shifted drastically. They moved up cause of Sprint’s free fall. Verizon at ~150M customers to TMO’s 72 is still worlds apart. Markets are cyclical, and hindsight is 20/20. You think Tmobile offered unlimited to help the little guy? The digital world is a different and vastly mature place now than it was 5-6 years ago when LTE was still being rolled out and data consumption was growing at exponential multiples quarter over quarter. Carriers panicked and pulled the rug on it – sure to make more money on a shiny new demanded thing, but they also wanted a ceiling to stay ahead of consequences of that growth. Now that that has cooled off they all offer ‘consumer friendly’ options and look like heros giving you a break. Keep drinking the kool aid, Legere is surely really interested in being your best friend. LOL. Do they even stick with a plan for more than year these days? My 2nd line isn’t even 2 years old and I’m sure those options are 2 versions old already. Who really comes across as insecure? Alex \n“But instead, he often makes changes to see what he can get away with and for how long before everyone else takes him on.” \nYou just described every non-profit ever. He has shareholders that he’s accountable to. Kellex B \nYou don’t have a problem with a company introducing plan after plan with pretty major yet easily fixable issues, that then either get miraculously fixed with a “Wow, look what we did! We listened to you!” or because a competitor forced them to? I’m all for competition, but again, the optics of a CEO who says he’s your best friend every day, yet runs his company like the opposite unless someone forces his hand isn’t something to stand up for, in my opinion. Alex \nHey, I’m with you on the optics. He does play some kind of people’s champion role and that gets old. \nI was just talking about the price. If I was on the board and we were already beating everyone on the market w/ price, I would probably not be alright to see profit margins shrinking even more without provocation. Kellex B \nWell yeah, I’m not going to argue with that side of it. The dude plays that side of the game and he’s turned around T-Mobile and made some nice changes happen industry-wide. \nBut the people’s champ schtick wore out its welcome a while ago when the bad plans kept changing every other week. Droid 1967 \nlegere is an ass…. and i lost all resepct for him, his plans over the last few were baiting with little exclusions he tried to hide until sites like this pointed them out, and than in some cases he bowed and changed it, but his initial offering was not a benefit for the consumer. Now that shamwow is gone tmobile will have a problem as i believe this guy understands its about keeping customers not saying if you dont like it leave attitude of shamwow. zepfloyd \nTHIS. Mr. Lou \nAgreed! If T-Mobile wasn’t so aggressive, I doubt we would be seeing Big Red offering unlimited plans again. Also, having the price include taxes and fees is pretty sweet. I am dubious of Binge-On and how it affects net neutrality, but overall, I like what T-Mobile is doing here. The Doctor \nThis guy runs his company like how Trump runs the country–reactionary based on what others are doing. TechGuy22 \ni agree Droid 1967 \nand is it not good for the tmobile customers? So i guess we are in good hands. TechGuy22 \nyeah it is good for customers in general i mean you wonder why they didn’t do that in first place. that’s why i didn’t move to them with unlimited plan with super limited services Droid 1967 \nno i was responding to the idiot who tried to bash trump in a totally unrelated topic. TechGuy22 \nsorry your president is stupid and you know it. Droid 1967 \nahh guess what… you liberals who state acceptance are nothing but hate and your time is over.
