Instead the broody superhero, Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and the pint-sized lil’ Wolverine (Dafne Keen’s Laura) seem to be in great distress in the woods. It’s not quite as fun as the last trailer that leaned heavily on Keen’s character, but the song choice, “Amazing Grace” brings us back to the tone of the excellent first trailer , which was scored by Johnny Cash. Things are looking bleak for these X-Men. \n\nTags: logan wolverine hugh jackman patrick stewart trailer mix super bowl li More   Top Stories Watch Lady Gaga Dive Into Super Bowl LI Naomie Harris on Control, Complacency, and Losing Herself in Moonlight Wolverine’s Claws Are Out in New Logan Trailer During the Super Bowl Most Viewed Stories Someone   Every Super Bowl Halftime Show Since 1993, Ranked from Worst to Best It’s Bustin’ Time in the First Look at Stranger Things Season Two Kristen Stewart Drops a Live F-Bomb, Mocks Donald Trump, and Announces That She’s ‘So Gay, Dude’ in Grand Trifecta SNL Monologue What’s New on Netflix: February 2017 What to Stream Now See what's new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBO Yes, Kate Beckinsale Is ‘Very Proud’ of Her ‘Granddaughter’ (And Ex-Husband’s Girlfriend) Sarah Silverman, Thank You for Asking Investigation Concludes A Dog’s Purpose Viral Animal-Abuse Video Was ‘Manipulated’ Saturday Night Live Recap: Kristen Stewart Drops an F-Bomb, Taunts Donald Trump Chelsea   Patton Oswalt Shares His Wife’s Cause of Death   Vulture Mark Hamill Can't Believe The Prequel Bashing Latest News from Vulture 11 mins ago Watch Lady Gaga Dive Into Super Bowl LI Lady Gaga opened the Half Time show from stadium roof.\n17 mins ago Naomie  \n8:19 p.m. Wolverine’s Claws Are Out in New Logan Trailer During the Super Bowl Things are looking bleak for these X-Men.\n8:16 p.m. Watch the New Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales Trailer Sparrow, that you?\n7:45 p.m. Hamilton ’s Schuyler Sisters Sang ‘America the Beautiful’ at The Super Bowl That’s some good harmonizing.\n4:59 p.m. Stephen Colbert Dares to Cover Talking Head’s ‘Once in a Lifetime’ in Tight Suit Same as he ever was: fully committed to the job at hand.\n4:09 p.m. MoMa Forefronts Art From Countries Affected By Trump Travel Ban The museum is moving pieces from the Western canon in order to showcase art from Iran, Iraq, and Sudan.\n3:19 p.m. Stephen Colbert Jockeys for Hosting Gig at Trump’s Correspondents’ Dinner With a first time like his, how could he resist?\n2:34 p.m. Everything About Batman Is Awesome in The Lego Batman Movie Theme Song “Who never skips leg day?
