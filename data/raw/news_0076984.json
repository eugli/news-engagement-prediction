Matt Damon,” Kimmel said. \n“Now Matt, I have known Matt for a long time now. I have known Matt so long when I first met Matt I was the fat one, OK. True. We have had problems. He’s a selfish person, those who work with him know this. But Matt did something very unselfish and I want to commend it for him. \n“Matt, as you probably know, could have stared in Manchester by the Sea — he was the producer and it is nominated for six Oscars including lead actor and he could have taken that lead actor part for himself, but he didn’t. He gave that role to Casey Affleck, his childhood friend. He handed over an Oscar-calibre role to his friend and make a Chinese ponytail movie instead. \n“That movie The Great Wall wept on went on to lose $80 million. Smooth move dumb ass. It is so easy to reach out and heal.” \nIn another effort to reach out, Kimmel then turned to President Donald Trump. \n“Maybe this is not a popular thing to say, I want to say congratulations to Donald Trump,” he said. “Remember last year when the Oscars seemed racist? It’s gone. Thanks to him.” \nNext up, Meryl Streep — who famously copped flak from the president earlier this year when Trump slammed the actress as “overrated”. \n“May I say from her mediocre early work in the Dear Hunter and Out of America and Kramer verses Kramer, Meryl Streep has had 50 films in her lacklustre year,” he joked. \n“This is her 20th nomination. Maybe more amazing considering she wasn’t in a movie this year. We wrote her name out of habit. Stand up and please give Meryl Streep a totally deserved round of applause.” \nAs Streep stood at the front of the room and Hollywood’s A-listers howled, Kimmel continued: “The highly overrated Meryl Streep, everyone!” \nDamien Chazelle, the man behind fan and critic favourite La La Land also got a jibe, with Kimmel noting the 14 nominations the film received represented “one for every year that Damien has been alive”. “Tonight is very important for Damien, if he wins he will be able to go to any college he wants,” Kimmel said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:05:30.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
