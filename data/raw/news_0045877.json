Media caption The Kurdish community paid their respects to Ryan Lock at Heathrow \nThe former chef, who had no previous military experience, joined the Kurdish armed fighting forces, the YPG, after telling his family he was going on holiday to Turkey in August. \nThe YPG told the BBC that \"trace of a gunshot wound was found under the chin\", suggesting suicide. At the scene: Emma Vardy, Home affairs correspondent, BBC South \nStaff at Heathrow were rather caught off guard as Ryan Lock's body arrived home. \nNo-one at the cargo bay of Royal Jordanian Airlines expected to see a crowd of mourners arriving on their forecourt. \nWith just a couple of hours notice, Kurds young and old turned out to pay tribute to a man from Chichester whom they had never met. \n\"This is not just a foreign war, this is a fight for humanity\", one told me. \n\"International solidarity\" they chant as they place flowers over the private ambulance carrying Ryan Lock's coffin. \nThey hold their hands up in silent salute. \nTo have a British man fight their cause, touches their hearts. \nA Kurdish mother kisses the ambulance and weeps as it drives away. \nSupporters of the YPJ female-fighting force paid tribute to Mr Lock, saying his memory would \"forever live on in our struggle for the freedom of Syria and our hope for change in the whole world\". \nYPG general command member Mihyedin Xirki had previously said Mr Lock was a \"martyr\" who died \"putting up a brave fight\". \nThe volunteer, who attended school in Havant, Hampshire, became the third British man to die fighting alongside the Kurds against so-called Islamic State. \nThe Foreign Office continues to advise against all travel to Syria.
