He fought a hard campaign. I think there are some lessons to learn from it in terms of how we campaign, in terms of how we target,\" Mr Farage told the BBC. \n\"There is a debate in Ukip as to how strong we should be on the immigration issue. I personally think we should own it. Paul Nuttall's Ukip campaign ends as it began... in chaos \n\"So we will have to look at that and think: were we really tough enough, were we clear enough with the electorate? It has got to be looked at.\" \nUkip had seen Stoke - which voted overwhelmingly for Brexit in last year's referendum - as fertile ground for a challenge to Labour in a contest triggered by the resignation of former shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt. \nHowever, Mr Nuttall's gamble of standing himself failed to come off as Labour's Gareth Snell held the seat with a majority of 2,620 - raising questions as to whether Ukip could take seats from Labour in its traditional heartlands. \nParty chairman Paul Oakden said it could be another two decades before the party can take another seat in a by-election. Victory: Labour candidate Gareth Snell and his wife Sophia (Getty Images) \n\"Politics is a long game. It took us 23-odd years to win a referendum to get Britain out of the European Union,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \n\"It may take that long for us to get a seat in Westminster via a by-election. But if that's how long it takes then that's what we will keep doing, because that's what we are here for.\" \nStoke had been regarded as promising territory by Ukip. \nMr Oakden acknowledged Mr Nuttall had endured a \"difficult\" campaign, in which he had to apologise over a false claim that he lost close friends in the Hillsborough disaster, but said he had the full support of the party.

He is 12 weeks into his leadership. We are all going to support him moving forward. This is one step along a long road for our party,\" he said. \n\"He has had a difficult campaign. There is no doubt that he has been targeted by various unpleasant elements during the last four weeks.
