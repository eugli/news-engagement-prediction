(Submitted by Gayle Adams)\nChallenging job Adams is a retired Licensed Practical Nurse who goes out and traps cats along with other volunteers.\nThe animals are then brought into a local vet clinic, usually the same day.\nVolunteers also try to keep them safe and warm after surgery for a few days.\nSince the cats are wild, it can be challenging work, said Adams.\n\"They terrified to death, a lot of them,\" she said. \"They're wild.\"\nBecause the cats are feral, trapping them can be challenging. (Submitted by Gayle Adams)\nShe remembered one feisty tom cat who got away before surgery as they were placing him in a truck.\n\"We had one one time â€¦ he did head butt towards the front [of the cage], the trap went completely off the tail gate of the truck and opened up and he went. We never found him yet,\" she said.\n'They reproduce quickly' Adams has had up to eight cats in traps in her car at once, and estimated she's personally helped 600 cats over the years.\nThis time of year the team focuses more on females when possible.\n\"One female cat, they have five kittens each time, they reproduce quickly,\" she said\nGayle Adams has had up to eight cats in traps in her car at once. (Submitted by Gayle Adams)\nNumbers improving The Cat Action Team formed in 2001, and Adams said she has seen an improvement since they began neutering and spaying.\n\"At one time it was so overwhelming,\" she said. \"It just seemed like you couldn't get caught up at all.\"\nShe said it feels good to see lives of local cats are getting better.\n\"It's gradually improving.\"\nVolunteers from the Cat Action Team trap stray and feral cats to spay and neuter.
