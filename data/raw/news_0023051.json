Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson has. \n\nPeople's \"Sexiest Man Alive,\" who, is also the highest-paid actor in Hollywood, launched a YouTube series in December called Seven Bucks Moment . In the premiere entry, Johnson discusses the lowest point in his life: when he was cut from the Canadian Football League after two months. \n\n\"I was so broke that I couldn't even afford a cab to the airport,\" Johnson says in the video. \n\nHe was 23 or 24 at the time, and he returned home to Miami and called his father for a ride back to his parents's apartment. In his father's truck, Johnson discovered that he had only $7 in his pocketâ€”hence the name of the series. \n\nRelated: People's 'Sexiest Man Alive' Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson on How to Be a YouTube Star \n\"It's the time in your life when you faced such adversity, such challenges, and you felt you had hit rock bottom and there was no place to go but rise back up again,\" Johnson says. \"We've all been there.

I didn't know when. But I did know my life wasn't just sitting around this apartment. I started turning my life around and I started training again.\" \n\nJohnson decided to end his pursuit of a professional football career to go into professional wrestling. As he puts it in the video: \"The rest, as they say, is history.\" \n\nWatch The Rock tell his story here: \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:34:49.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
