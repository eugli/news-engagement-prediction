Article continues below \nThe World group first-round Davis Cup tie in Ottawa between Canada and Great Britain was to be decided in the fifth rubber between Denis Shapovalov and Kyle Edmund. \nHaving dropped the opening two sets 3-6 4-6, the Canadian didn't take kindly to his serve being broken early in the third. Article continues below Watch: Griezmann's questionable reaction after Torres scored against Leganes \nTrailing 2-1 and showing few sings of instigating a remarkable comeback, Shapovalov belted the ball away in anger, inadvertently hitting umpire Arnaud Gabas in the eye. \nThe incident cast an eery silence over the stunned crowd at the TD Place Arena while both players approached the umpire’s chair to check on him. \nClutching his face in pain, Gabas had no choice but to default Shapovalov and give Great Britain a 3-2 win and a path to the quarter-finals where they will take on France in April. \nCheck out what happened in the video below. Ouch. \nThe mistake was one that certainly could've been avoided and the distraught 17-year-old has since approached the umpire in the referee’s office to apologise. \nSpeaking at his post-match press conference, Shapovalov was clearly remorseful for his actions and the resulting impact on Canada's Davis Cup campaign. \n“I would like to begin with apologising to that umpire, the referee and to all ITF officials,” he said, as per the Telegraph . \n“It was unacceptable behaviour from me. I feel incredibly ashamed and embarrassed, for letting my team down and my country down. That’s the last time I’m going to do anything like that. I’m going to learn from it.” \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
