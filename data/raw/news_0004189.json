I do not want to disclose certain realities, to not ruin certain unconscious beings, and that’s all.” \nThe handcuffed murder suspect asked a television reporter to contact his surviving family for bail money, and suggested he wanted new legal counsel. Joan Viau, 52, was last seen heading to the hospital with her son Joseph Garcia on Monday, Jan. 23, 2017. (Facebook) \n“I need an attorney that’s fully informed,” shouted the handcuffed man. “An actual attorney. And an actual life.” \nThe 52-year-old Viau was missing for six days before her butchered corpse was found this past Saturday in a wooded stretch of Upper Manhattan about eight blocks north of the George Washington Bridge. \nAutopsy results made public Monday showed the victim’s throat was slashed. NYPD's Crime Scene Unit seen examining the missing mother's red Toyota SUV. (Sam Costanza/for New York Daily News) \nA half-dozen court officers led an uncomfortable-looking Garcia, wearing a brown prison suit and a mop of untamed hair, into the courtroom Tuesday afternoon. \nBronx mom found dead after son named suspect in her disappearance \nGarcia’s defense lawyer, Martin Fisher, asked for his client’s release on a charge of possession of stolen property — his dead mom’s credit card. \nAssistant District Attorney Orville Reynolds instead announced the new charges against Garcia: “The defendant will be taken into custody by NYPD officers ... murder in the second degree.” Joseph Garcia (l.) appears in Bronx Criminal Court on minor charges for stealing. He was released and then arrested again by NYPD detectives for the alleged murder of his mother. (Facebook) \nViau was last seen Jan. 23 with her son outside her Williamsbridge home as she left for an appointment at a local Veterans Affair hospital. \nHer son Garcia was quickly identified by authorities as the No. 1 suspect in her disappearance and death. \nViau’s red 1998 Toyota 4Runner was found last Wednesday near her home, with blood on the rear seat and a bloody palm print on the cloth ceiling, sources said. \nSurveillance video caught Garcia, of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, parking the car near his mom's home and walking away from the vehicle. He was also seen on video using Viau's ATM card, sources said. \nGarcia was arrested Thursday after investigators found his mother’s credit card in his front pants pocket. His lawyer said the accused murderer came to court expecting to make bail.
