Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAtomic Kitten may have sung about being Whole Again, but it seemed to be a case of WINE again this week as they appear to be enjoying a boozy time on tour. \nSingers Kerry Katona , Natasha Hamilton and Michelle Heaton are hitting the road in New Zealand, and it looks like they are making the most of the chance to party after shows. \nThe trio were spotted enjoying glasses of wine on Waiheke Island in Auckland, and while they've having fun it made for a difficult drive the morning after. The girl's tour manager helped her to the hotel (Photo: MEGA) It wasn't going well for Michelle (Photo: MEGA) Natasha had to comfort her bandmate (Photo: MEGA) Girls on tour (Photo: MEGA) \nThe taxi they were heading back in had to pull over, with Michelle promptly being sick at the side of the road after the night before. \nHer bandmate Natasha could be seen crouching to comfort her and as the car later pulled up near the hotel, the group's manager helped her from the vehicle to the building. The girls have been having a blast (Photo: MEGA) \nThe girls have been letting their hair down on tour, and Liberty X singer Michelle - who is standing in for Liz McLarnon due to her fear of flying - is making the most of the opportunity. \n\"Kerry and Natasha are a bit more wild than I'm used to in Liberty X but I'm crazy too, so it's perfect,\" she previously admitted. Atomic Kitten with Michelle Heaton The group are touring in New Zealand \n\"We're all mums so when we're away we let our hair down. We don't get to do that at home.\" \nHowever, the girls have also been forced to deny claims of a rift and \"awkward tension\" between Kerry and Natasha throughout the band's set. \nThe odd vibe was apparently made worse when Kerry hit a few bum notes on the group's biggest smash hits. \nKerry responded to the reports on Twitter, writing: \"Where the hell is this spat between tash and me has come from god knows \n\"NatashaOfficial we're like bloody sisters!
