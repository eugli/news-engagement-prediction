Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images It has been observed often that this year’s CPAC conference reflects the accommodation of the conservative movement to a new Republican president who has been less than orthodox in his views. But the precise terms of that accommodation were not clear until Trump himself addressed the conference today: Conservatives must give up their philosophical principles in exchange for policies they favor and the popular support they crave.\nAmazingly, Trump spoke for an extended period to an exclusively conservative audience and never used the terms liberty or limited government or free enterprise . He used the word freedom exactly twice. Once was in a reference to the TPP agreement being a threat to “our economic freedom,” a characterization that — until recently — few mainstream conservatives would support. The other was in boasting about his election win:\nThe victory and the win were something that really was dedicated to a country and people that believe in freedom, security and the rule of law. Our victory… (APPLAUSE) … was a victory and the win for conservative values. That was also the speech’s only clear reference, explicitly or implicitly, to the brand of conservative values that have dominated the discourse at CPAC for decades.\nTrump did offer a lot of crowd-pleasing lines, roughly divided equally between attacks on common enemies like the non-conservative elements of the news media, and promises to pursue specific policies most conservatives like, from defense spending increases to tax cuts to deregulation to aggressive exploitation of fossil fuels.\nBut invariably Trump framed his policies not with the traditional memes of movement conservatism, but as expressions of his one clear guiding principle: nationalism. Or, as he put it: “The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that will put its own citizens first.”\nWhile patriotism, of course, is a common touchstone for American conservatives (and for liberals, though conservatives often have trouble acknowledging it), nationalism disassociated from the idea that America distinctively stands for universal values — e.g., freedom or “liberty” or limited government — is not a value Republicans have traditionally embraced. Presumably many of the same people who cheered Trump at CPAC also cheered George W. Bush when he used to talk about freedom and democracy being America’s gift to the world, a gift worth fighting to defend and extend — rhetoric Ronald Reagan also used throughout his career (otherwise his favorite rhetorical reference to America as “a shining city on a hill” is nonsensical).\nThe idea that Trump isn’t asking conservatives to change that much simply is not true. He’s asking them to acknowledge that discarding their most cherished positions in order to vanquish their foes and achieve their immediate goals is absolutely necessary, with his electoral victory after the defeat of more conventional leaders like McCain and Romney being the proof. And thus he represents the eternal temptation of right-bent political thinkers and actors everywhere and at every time to overcome their scruples and embrace “populist” demagogues.\nAs Trump ended his speech and the room was filled with his odd campaign anthem, the Rolling Stones’ “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” for the first time I saw the song as entirely appropriate. Conservatives cannot elect a president who talks only or mostly of freedom and capitalism or of those Western values that transcend the nation-state. But they can win with Trump, so they’ll get what they need, at the mere expense of their principles, if not their souls.\nTags: cpac donald trump conservatism freedom nationalism ronald reagan More Trump Offers CPAC the World — in Exchange for Its Principles Trump’s Rollback on Transgender Bathroom Rule Is Just the Beginning Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party Trump’s Health-Care Nightmare Is Only Just Beginning Most Viewed Stories This Obscure News Story, Which Should Be Huge, Shows How Trump Gets Away With Corruption Customs Agents Check Passengers’ IDs on Domestic Flight at JFK Trump Condemns FBI Leakers for Leaking That He Asked Them to Leak Connie Britton Leaves Nashville Fans With the Cold Comfort of a Heartfelt Coda After That Momentous Episode Trump’s Health-Care Nightmare Is Only Just Beginning Vulture’s Final 2017 Oscar Predictions for Every Category Video Games Are Better Than Real Life 15 Stars Reminisce About the Actors Who Used to Beat Them Out for Roles Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party Trump’s Counterterrorism Adviser Sebastian Gorka Has Links to Anti-Semitic Groups Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer The Wildest Moments From Donald Trump’s Press Conference Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 6:19 p.m. New York City Recorded Its Lowest Number of Traffic Fatalities in 2016 A small dip from 2015, but the third-straight yearly decline under Vision Zero.\n6:13 p.m. Democrats Make a Risky Pick for Response to Trump’s Big Speech to Congress Former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear is an out-of-work centrist representing a party that’s energized on the left.\n6:04 p.m. Leaked House Obamacare Repeal Draft Shows Dangerous Work in Progress A leaked document shows House Republicans mulling controversial ideas like ending Medicaid as we know it and a new tax on employer-provided insurance.\n5:42 p.m. Leaked DHS Report Undermines Trump’s Argument for His Travel Ban It says citizenship in the Muslim-majority countries included in the ban is an “unlikely indicator” of a terrorism threat.\n4:50 p.m. GOP Tax Cut Waiting for Trump to Decide on Policy He Clearly Doesn’t Understand Don’t feel bad for Paul Ryan, he’ll end up getting a big tax cut for the rich in the end.\n4:31 p.m. A Bunch of Cities Are Sweating Through the Hottest February Day on Record It’s been a hot month, with nearly 4,500 record highs set, compared to 29 record lows.\n3:51 p.m. Kansas Suspect Allegedly Said ‘Get Out of My Country,’ Then Shot 2 Indian Men The White House denied any links to President Trump’s rhetoric.\n3:39 p.m. White House Bars New York Times , CNN, and Politico From Press Briefing Earlier in the day, Trump explained that the media isn’t the “enemy of the people” — but the fake news media is .\n2:40 p.m. Trump Expected to Pick Man Known For Bad Economic Advice As Top Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett once co-authored a book imploring investors to enter the stock market — just before the dot-com bubble burst.\n2:37 p.m. Trump Offers Conservatives the World — in Exchange for Their Principles Is the mainstream right ready to replace its traditional values with pure nationalism?\n1:04 p.m. Trump’s Rollback on Transgender Bathroom Rule Is Just the Beginning It looked like Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s warm-up act in loosening protections for all minorities.\n12:57 p.m. Trump Praises First Amendment, Calls for Media Suppression and Fewer Protests The president told CPAC the media “shouldn’t be allowed” to cite anonymous sources, and suggested people shouldn’t protest after an election.\n12:23 p.m. Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party “We will not answer to donors, lobbyists, or special interests … now here’s another story about me answering to special interests.”\n11:56 a.m. Trump’s Security Adviser Sebastian Gorka Has Links to Anti-Semitic Groups This may be the lowlight of a week that also saw him make an unhinged phone call to a critic that got recorded and published.\n11:51 a.m. Trump: U.S. Has ‘Fallen Behind’ on Nukes, Vows to Return to ‘Top of the Pack’ This isn’t the first time the president has appeared to advocate for nuclear proliferation.\n9:44 a.m. Trump Condemns FBI Leakers for Leaking That He Asked Them to Leak The White House asked the FBI to leak exculpating details about Trump’s ties with Russia.
