And with just 13 games to go, they're firm favourites to win the title. (Photo: REUTERS) \nNormally, this would be a reason to make any manager in that position very happy indeed. But after how recent events have unfolded at the Foxes, Conte is a man who should be made very aware that winning the league is not very good for your job prospects. \nThat's because the last two Premier League winning managers have failed to see out their following season. Jose Mourinho - 2014/15 winner \nMay 2015: Won the Premier League, finishing eight points clear of Manchester City. \nDecember 2015: Sacked by Chelsea after their dismal slump in form. Claudio Ranieri - 2015/16 winner \nMay 2016: Won the Premier League, finishing 10 points clear of Arsenal. \nFebruary 2017: Sacked by Leicester - despite a vote of no confidence just days before. \nNo wonder Gary Neville has labelled winning the title the \"new poisoned chalice\": \nOn top of this, although he didn't win the league himself, David Moyes was fired by champions Manchester United in April 2014 after he failed to defend the title the club had won in the previous campaign. \nSo, the evidence is there - on current trend, winning the Premier League gets you fired.
