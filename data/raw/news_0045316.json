So no more snow on our upper decks and no more winter parkas and the crews are just really pumped about going,” Lt.-Cmdr Nicole Robichaud, commanding officer of HMCS Moncton, said. \nREAD MORE: Life at sea: an inside look into the world of a Royal Canadian Navy sailor \nThe deployment also includes a stop in the city of Freetown, Sierra Leone , a moment Lt.-Cmdr Smith is eagerly anticipating. \n“For those who don’t know, the city of Freetown was actually settled by Nova Scotian settlers. They were free slaves from the American Revolution that migrated up to Nova Scotia, lived here and 15,000 of them in 1792 headed on two ships and crossed to settle Freetown,” Lt.-Cmdr Smith said. \nThe journey gives Lt.-Cmdr Smith an opportunity to reconnect Nova Scotia to its West African roots. \n“We’re trying to reestablish the connection between Nova Scotia and Freetown,” he said. \nIt’s a connection that members of the African Nova Scotia community are thrilled to reignite through the eyes of Lt.-Cmdr Smith’s eyes. \n“It’s special in a couple of ways. One, to have somebody who’s of African ancestry to do that, makes it amazing and during Black History Month as well is kind of the icing on the cake but to also know that he can be an inspiration to others,” said Craig Smith, director of the Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia. \nBoth vessels are expected to return to Nova Scotia sometime in May. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
