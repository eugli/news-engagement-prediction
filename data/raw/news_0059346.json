(Russell) Scotland 9-13 Wales \nRussell slots and ensures the visitors lead is only four at the break. Game on! 15:11 Scotland searching \nIs this the try Scotland so want... no. \nVisser and Jones storm through on the counter after a superbly taken quick line-out, they line is there for them but the Welsh forwards are at it again. Somehow they've turned it over and Biggar is able to clear. \nStill Scotland come, though. 15:09 MISSED PENALTY \nThis time it's Huw Jones who is pinged, he doesn't roll away and it's a penalty for Halfpenny. Uncharacteristic from him though as he pushes his kick right. 15:03 PENALTY! Scotland 6-13 Wales (Halfpenny) \nGreat work from Warburton and Tipuric snare Scotland and force them to hold on and give away the penalty. \nIt's dead straight from 40 metres, but that's meat and drink for Halfpenny 15:00 \nSome images of that Liam Williams try are beginning to filter through. 14:59 \nEasy does it from Russell as he closes the gap to four. 14:58 Optimistic... \nRussell chips in behind Halfpenny and sends the full-back and team-mate Hogg dashing for the line. Hogg think's he's touched it down for the try but Halfpenny got back superbly. \nStill, we're going back for a penalty after a high tackle from Sam Warburton. Should be any easy three points for Russell. 14:56 Foul play from Webb \nLiam Williams wriggles into so much space and charges towards the line, but he has to wait for support and his offload to Rob Evans is knocked on. \nWe're with the TMO right now, who wants to know if the ball was grounded, but first we're looking into the actions of Webb. \nThe scrum-half is adjudged to have tugged Seymour back, meaning he can't make a tackle, and play comes back. \nScotland find touch, just outside the Wales 22. 14:51 TRY WALES - 3-10! Liam Williams goes over in the corner \nTRY! Wales win the free-kick from the scrum, Webb takes the quick tap and works the ball wide through Halfpenny, into the hands of Williams, who touches down. \nHalfpenny adds the extras from the touchline. What a place kicker he is. 14:49 Attacking chance for Wales \nRaw strength from George North to hold up Tim Visser after he collect's Biggar's bomb on the edge of his own 22, with Wales winning the put in at an attacking scrum. \nPlay's stopped for a few minutes to look at John Hardie, who appears to be struggling with his knee. 14:46 Finn Russell successfully kicks for goal Rob Evans of Wales is tackled by Gordon Reid of Scotland 14:44 No quarter given \nWhat a take from Leigh Halfpenny under pressure from Boyd. The Welsh full-back is rocked by his man but still manages to come down with the ball. \nThe battle for field position is a very tactical one here, with some massive hits in midfield. \nDan Biggar has been particularly chirpy so far, with referee John Lacey telling him to be quiet. 14:37 PENALTY! 3-3 (Halfpenny) - Wales reply \n12 minutes: A very simple kick for Halfpenny after Wales go through the phases in Scotland territory. We're all level. 14:34 Warren Gatland the head coach of the British and Irish Lions Nicola Sturgeon the First Minister of Scotland 14:32 PENALTY - 3-0: Russell makes it and Scotland lead \nEasy stuff for the fly-half. 14:30 Aggressive Scots \nScotland win their own lineout ball and the hosts look to drive the maul but Wales stand firm. Ali Price works the forwards as they play a patient game, before heading out to the backs. \nThey win the penalty advantage and we'll go back for an easy three points. 14:29 Solid opening Scottish scrum \nFour minutes: Scotland have the game's first scrum and are solid, winning a penalty off Wales on halfway. \nThe Scots have given away more scrum penalties than any of their Six Nations rivals, but that's a good start. \nFinn Russell kicks to touch. 14:25 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T17:46:38.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
