(Photo: BrianAJackson, Getty Images/iStockphoto) \nThe FBI is helping University of Michigan police investigate who sent a series of racist emails to hundreds of U-M college of engineering students on Tuesday night, university spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said. \nThe emails were sent from a \"spoofed\" account of a U-M professor. unlike a hacked email where someone gains control of an email account, a spoofed email is a forgery designed to look like it came from out of the country. \nThree emails were sent to email groups of U-M students. It's not clear exactly how many students got them, but it could include the entire undergraduate class of the college, Fitzgerald said. \nThe emails included subjects such as \"African American Student Diversity\" and \"Jewish Student Diversity.\" The emails trumpeted white power and the KKK and made threats against black students and Jewish students. Two of the emails included the phrase \"Heil Trump.\" \n► Also read: Canton cop resigns over racist Facebook post \nU-M junior Mary Wills, 20, of Chicago, was sitting with a friend last night when the email popped up on the friend's laptop. \n\"We couldn't believe it,\" she told the Free Press. \"We couldn't figure out why a professor would be sending that out. We were in shock. But then we talked to some others and realized someone had done something to his email. There's no way he would have sent this out.\" \nThe computer science and engineering professor whose name was linked to the emails denies sending them. J. Alex Halderman says \"the content of these emails is contemptible\" and it takes \"very little technical sophistication\" to forge a sender's email address. \nAfter the emails were received a late-night protest was held at U-M President Mark Schlissel's campus residence. He addressed the students and condemned the emails. He did so again in a 2:17 a.m. tweet. \nThis is not the first time this school year racist messages have shown up on campus. \nIn September, racist flyers were posted . \nOne poster argued that white women should not date black men, while a separate poster depicted a “STOP!” sign while urging “Euro-Americans” to stop “living in fear” and “denying (their) heritage,” according to a tweet from U-M’s Black Student Union. \nU-M isn't the only campus facing race issues this school. Eastern Michigan University - located less than 10 miles east of U-M - also has had racist graffiti and phone calls made to students. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.
