Teams are heading there,” he said. \nPolice say there has been no communication with the officers who were at the post which is about 100 kilometres away from Mandera town and hence a team has been dispatched to establish what happened. \nLast month, a police reservist was killed in a foiled attack in Mandera Town. \nThis is the latest mast to be targeted in a series. Many others were attacked in Fino town in the area. \nOthers were attacked in Dabacity in Elwak. \nDabacity had last year become a terror hotspot recording about four incidents in less than a month.
