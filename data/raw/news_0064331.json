No, there's no question about it,\" Kirby said.\nViolence in the classroom During the forum, educators said large, inclusive classrooms with not enough resources was leading to violence against teachers.\n\"It's disturbing that that would happen at all, but it does happen in our schools,\" Kirby said.\n'We are challenged to provide inclusive education with the resources that we have...' - Dale Kirby, education minister Despite the issues with the current inclusive education model, Kirby said he doesn't want to go back to the days of segregation, like Exon House in St. John's — a provincial institution that housed children and adults with developmental disabilities.\n\"We are challenged to provide inclusive education with the resources that we have and the model that we're trying to use,\" he said, noting that teachers work under exceptionally difficult circumstances.\n\"I just think we really have to adjust things, change the way that we're doing things, and I'm really hoping to work with the task force when they get to the end of the road.\"\nDale Kirby said it's disturbing to know that violence against teachers is occurring in Newfoundland and Labrador classrooms. (CBC)\nA report is expected from the task force in June, and then they will develop an action plan.\n\"It is my hope that in the budget next year, that we can start to put things together, in a way that we can change the system for September 2018,\" Kirby said.\n\"I fully acknowledge that's sort of cold comfort for people right now who are looking for help.\"\nStepping inside the classroom Kirby said he has visited many schools and spoken with teachers, so he wasn't shocked by anything he heard throughout the Inside the Classroom series.\n\"But I don't dispute that there are significant challenges that we have to overcome, because otherwise we're failing our kids, and I don't want to be responsible for that,\" he said.\n'There are significant challenges that we have to overcome, because otherwise we're failing our kids...' - Dale Kirby, education minister When asked if disciplinary action would be taken against the teachers who spoke out as part of the series, Kirby replied: \"Never.\"\n\"I have been very clear from the beginning: We need to hear from teachers,\" he said.\n\"They're able to speak out publicly; there's no problem with that.\"\nWith files from Anthony Germain", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:09:29.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
