Beijing has claimed ownership of the islands from the 14th century, while Tokyo argues it had ownership of the islands from 1895 until its surrender at the end of World War II.

Mattis made clear that the United States opposes any “unilateral action” to “overthrow” Japan’s administration of the Senkaku Islands. \n“I made clear that our long-standing policy on the Senkaku Islands stands – the US will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands and as such Article 5 of the US-Japan Security Treaty applies,” Mattis said in a press conference with Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada. \nUnder Article 5 of the treaty, the US agreed to defend territories under Japanese administration, which would include the disputed island chain in the East China Sea. \nBeijing was quick to respond to Mattis’s comments, urging the US to tone down its rhetoric in regards to China in order to avoid instability to the region. \n“The Diaoyu Island and its adjacent islets have been an inherent part of Chinese territory since ancient times, which is a unchangeable historical fact,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said following the US official's statement. \nThe spokesman called the US-Japan security treaty a “product of the Cold War,” which should not harm China’s territorial “sovereignty and legitimate rights.” — RT (@RT_com) 10 December 2016 \n“We urge the US side to take a responsible attitude, stop making wrong remarks on the issue involving the Diaoyu Islands sovereignty, and avoid making the issue more complicated and bringing instability to the regional situation,” the spokesman added , according to Xinhua. \nChina and the US seem to be heading on a collision course after President Donald Trump assumed power in the US.

South Korean decision to place Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), allegedly to battle North Korean threat, has also added fuel to the fire. \nTrump, however, exacerbated the bilateral relations even further and has threatened to oppose China on a number of fronts, from military build-up to monetary policy. He has even cast doubt on Washington’s long-standing commitment to the “one China policy,” which regards Taiwan as one with mainland China governed by Beijing. Trump’s adviser, Steve Bannon, even warned of a possible war between China and the US.

Mattis promised to continue that strategy. \nTo protect its rights, China has begun artificially expanding and militarizing its islands in the area. Since 2014 Beijing has equipped them with airfields, ports and weapons systems while warning the US warships and aircraft to stay away from the area. \n“China has indisputable sovereignty over the relevant islands and reefs in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters. China will firmly safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea,” Kang told reporters Friday during a regular press briefing.

We urge relevant parties to end the deployment and stop making more steps down the erroneous path,” Kang said. \nCommenting on the development of a possible trade war between two states, China has appeared to be calm about possible future outcomes. \n“As for the economic and trade issues between China and the US which have been much talked about by President Trump, we keep stressing that the economic and trade ties between the two countries did not grow to the current scale by accident. It is the result of the joint efforts of the two governments, peoples and business circles.” Kang said. “To maintain such a sound momentum serves the interests of the two sides.” \n“China will never wage a currency war to seek advantage or to gain a competitive edge in trade. We have no intention of causing a currency war,” the spokesman stressed. “Long-term speaking, such war brings no benefit to China.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T06:05:32.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
