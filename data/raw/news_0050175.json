The moves would take its permanent workforce in the country to 24,000. \nDoug Gurr, UK country manager at Amazon, said the jobs would provide \"even faster delivery, more selection and better value\" for British customers. \nAmazon's new head office in London will have capacity for more than 5,000 people by the end of the year, the firm said. The concentration of tech expertise in London has been cited by many firms as an attraction. \n(Reporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Adrian Croft) Amazon.com's logo is seen at Amazon Japan's office building in Tokyo, Japan, August 8, 2016.
