Members of his extended family were left on the hook for $55,000, while company filings indicate that investors received nothing. At the time Karen disappeared she owned two fashion companies with her husband - formalwear business Bella Bleu, which had two stores, and Warrant Brands. Before Mrs Ristevski disappeared a caveat was placed over her property, preventing it from being bought or sold, by the same company which owns one of the malls where they had a store. Despite their financial woes, friends said the couple appeared to continue 'living large' - flying off on holidays on business class flights Mrs Ristevski's body was found concealed between these logs in bushland around a 40 minute drive away from her home on Monday The legal order is typically used to secure an asset when a tenant falls into arrears, though it is not clear why it was used in this case. Mr Ristevski had been working at one of those businesses on the day she vanished - June 29, 2016.

The 'badly decomposed' remains were found buried in a shallow grave underneath two heavy logs and were discovered by a hiker. Borce is now the prime suspect in her death, according to his own lawyer, having been interviewed but released at the time she vanished. No charges have been laid and no arrests made. Daily Mail Australia is not alleging Mr Ristevski was involved in the crime.
