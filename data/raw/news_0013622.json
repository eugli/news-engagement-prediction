Senior Chyanne Dennis scored off a corner kick from sophomore Emma Vasquez in the 32nd minute to stretch the lead to 4-1.\nNorth Fort Myers, which saw its 18-game unbeaten string come to an end, scored at the end of the first half off a goal by freshman Taylor Metzger to pull within 4-2. Junior Amanda DaSilvia converted a penalty kick in the 52nd minutes, but could draw no closer.\n\"We are up 4-1 and they should have never come back,\" said Patriots coach Cindy Marcial, who team defeated North Fort Myers 3-1 in last year's regional final in the only other meeting between the two schools. American Heritage will face the winner of the Osceola (Seminole)/Merritt Island game in the state semifinal on Friday, Feb. 17 at Spec Martin Stadium in Deland.\n\"Our goalkeeper made a could of mistakes, but we will learn from it,\" Marcial said. \"It is so weird with this team because sometimes they get so nervous that we can't even play our style. It's a win. I'm Happy and we move on.\"\nAmerican Heritage last lost in the postseason in the state title game in 2012, when it fell to Ponte Vedra 2-1.\nThe Patriots, who returned 22 of 24 players from last season, are looking for their 10th FHSAA title and fifth in a row.\nIt would tie Douglas (2003-07) for second place on the state all-time list. St. Thomas Aquinas holds the all-time consecutive streak of seven from 1993 to 1999 and lead the state with 13 state championships.\n Soccer Florida High School Athletic Association", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-589548e2/turbine/fl-hs-gs-region4-3a-final-0204-20170203"], "published": "2017-02-04T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:03:48.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
