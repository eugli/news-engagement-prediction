Because it's not real baseball. It's fake baseball. \nAnother thing. The weather. We really haven't had a proper winter, dang it, and what makes me unhappy about that is this: Without a good winter, with plenty of snow and cold, how can we celebrate a false spring? \nDon't you love those false spring stories, the kind of columns full of the first scents of the earth, and the wistful way some write them, turgid with promise, full of longing for the taste of a tree-ripened peach in July? \nOK. Slap me right in the face. Go on. I said it's OK. \nIt's been so meh this winter that friends can't even sting you with their ridiculous \"Hey I'm in tropical paradise and you're not\" pictures. \nMy brother-in-law Don sends us beautiful photos from Hawaii, of waterfalls, landscapes, the Pacific Ocean. I stare at them, then look out at my February backyard, and the few, scattered leavings of Zeus the Wonderdog. \nHis leavings should be frozen, and covered by snow, so I might ignore them. It's February dammit. But there they sit, so I might as well get the scooper. \nOh, I hate you global warming. \nMaking things worse is that Parker Bros., of \"Monopoly\" fame, has decided to drop the classic thimble as a game piece. That's all we need now. \nDrop the thimble? What's next? They'll melt the little dog? \nAbout the only truly happy news around is word that Peter Dinklage, the fine actor who plays the heroic dwarf Tyrion Lannister in \"Game of Thrones,\" has signed on to play the lead in a film based on one of my favorite novels. \n\"The Dwarf\" is the brilliant but thoroughly depressing novel by Nobel laureate Par Lagerkvist. \nIMBD reports that Dinklage is to play the court dwarf to a Machiavellian lord. And guess what? It's a not-happy story of bitterness, deceit, pain, sadness, revenge, unctuous courtiers and evil. It's set in Renaissance Italy, which is like modern Washington, without the cool costumes and artists. \nThe novel, begins this way: \nI am twenty-six inches tall, shapely and well proportioned, my head perhaps a trifle too large. My hair is not black like the others', but reddish, very stiff and thick, drawn back from the temples and the broad but not especially lofty brow. My face is beardless, but otherwise just like that of other men. My eyebrows meet. My bodily strength is considerable, particularly if I am annoyed. When the wrestling match was arranged between Jehoshaphat and myself I forced him onto his back after twenty minutes and strangled him. Since then I have been the only dwarf at this court. \nHappy now? \nAll happiness is local anyway, and I ruined Valentine's Day. \nA dozen roses? Check. A card with real writerly stuff she loved that's none of your beeswax? Check. Dinner? Of course. \nBut she wanted to see \"La La Land.\" \nAnd like a fool I said there's no bleeping way I watch a movie with bleeping Ryan Gosling singing and dancing with that Ryan Gosling smirk that's supposed to suggest intelligence on his Ryan Gosling face. \nBetty: So what do you want to see, honey? \nMe (Stupidly): How about \"Manchester by the Sea\"? \nIt was a great movie, and the audience shed copious tears. But they weren't the happy tears after watching say, \"Notting Hill.\" These were bitter tears of loss. \n\"Oh, that was so depressing,\" she said later. \"Happy Valentine's Day. Thanks.\" \nSorry honey, I said, biting my lips in self-loathing. \n\"Well, Happy Valentine's Day,\" she sniffed again. \"You have any Kleenex?\" \nLater, a married guy asked me if it was true that I took Betty to \"Manchester by the Sea\" on Valentine's Day. \n\"Man,\" he said. \"That's really (bleeping) stupid.\" \nYeah, that's stupid. \nAnd I'm Mr. Not Happy about it. \nListen to \"The Chicago Way\" podcast with John Kass and Jeff Carlin at www.wgnradio.com/category/wgn-plus/thechicagoway .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:38:28.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
