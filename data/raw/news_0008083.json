The ad, which was created by Ogilvy London and placed in select UK papers, jokes that the new deodorant “increases your IQ by 40 points,” “rhymes with orange,” and “boosts your Wi-FI signal,” among other amazing falsehoods facts. \nHere is the first page of the ad:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T19:28:39.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
