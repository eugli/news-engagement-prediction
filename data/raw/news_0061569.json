The backstage hairstylist was summarizing the look at Fendi this morning, where Karl Lagerfeld hoped to summon a breath of fresh air for the Italian house by way of a diverse cast of young faces. That meant a serious embrace of natural texture and personal style—see the curls coaxed outward and upward on Selena Forrest and Imaan Hammam, or Manuela Sanchez’s neatly clipped Afro. Sohyun Jung and Nina Milner wore their new-ish boy cuts , enhanced with a cloud of McKnight’s forthcoming texturizing spray; appropriately called Cool Girl Hair , it's rumored to be out stateside, along with the rest of the editorial legend's new styling line, later this year . Elsewhere, the look called for rough, beachy waves, spun into ringlets then dampened with generous water and salt spray until they grew lank. The louche bedhead made a sharp contrast with the luxe furs and structured wool coats in the collection. It was come-as-you-are beauty à la Fendi—Adwoa Aboah and Slick Woods’s freshly buzzed heads were on display, and Kendall Jenner only needed two offhand tousles to achieve the right level of cool. Some are born with it. For the rest of us, there’s always Cool Girl Hair.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:47:47.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
