It must be staffed by the most competent and cleanest person. \nNewly appointed auditor-general Madinah Mohamad doesn't have any qualification or experience in the area of financial management. \nThis makes her ineligible to be even considered for the job. Something is very wrong somewhere to see a non-qualified person heading a top position in this country. Who knows, she might just decide to send an accountant to the moon. \nKingfisher: If an individual's core competences are not compatible for a particular job that requires specific credentials and a reasonable period of work experience in positions related to similar operational and supervisory functions, then the individual's appointment will not contribute to professional efficacy of the office. \nAny support towards social engineering in appointments should not be seen to encroach on the core functions of good governance, especially the scrutiny of public funds through the Auditor-General's Office. \nThere have been good examples where an appointee declines a position with due regard to one 's own sense of regard for the demands of the position in question, notwithstanding the willingness of the one offering the position. \nOne would like to think that considering the hard times now nationally in finance and development, the public would have had less to worry if a more suitable candidate had been identified given the huge reservoir of numbers at the top echelon of our civil service. \nWorldly Wise: Madinah has no accounting past. How is she going to read accounts? How is she going to read the balance sheets? How is she going to differentiate between what is cost and what is gain? How is she going to know what is debit and what is credit? \nIs there no risk that a politician who influences his party members will in all likelihood influence his wife? Why cannot we get somebody independent and unattached to be appointed to such a position of trust and integrity? \nGodfearing: What integrity? Anyone with integrity will never accept a job he/she is not professionally qualified for, in the first place. \nHow can anyone with no accounting knowledge be competent enough to be an auditor? Malaysia has become a laughing stock in the international arena. Cry, my beloved country. \nHornbill: Well said, former treasurer-general Mohd Sheriff Mohd Kassim. But it's a pity though that only future appointments should be subjected to the scrutiny you mentioned. \nSo, nothing can be done about the appointment of the auditor-general? She has no background in accounting, so how come she became auditor-general? \nPeople are now talking about her new role, that is to clear MO1 (Malaysian Official 1) of wrongdoing in the 1MDB fiasco. \nAfter all, the previous Auditor-General's Report on 1MDB had been placed under the Official Secrets Act (OSA). No one will be surprised if she'll say that there's no hanky-panky in those accounts after all. \nDrngsc: Dear Sheriff, must I jump out the 45th floor of KLCC to find out if I would die? Shall I give that madman a chance to try and proof that? \nAppointing a plumber to do a doctor’s job (according to the headline in another article ) is just another way of saying, we want the patient to die. \nIf you do not wish your accounts to be audited, that is exactly what you would do - appoint a political science major to be chief accountant to the government. \nAnonymous 2413201460529218: There is a legal maxim: \"Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done.\" \nHere, it would mean that as long as there are reasonable grounds to believe that she may not be suitable, then she should not be appointed. After all, there are others who are more capable. Sheriff ought to know that. \nWhy does Sheriff say she must be given a chance? We are speaking of one of the most vital jobs in Malaysia. If she proves a failure, is he prepared to take the rap? \nVictor Johan: Sheriff, surely you would allow a butcher to give you advice on open heart surgery and perhaps allow him to make a small incision on your chest to determine if there's any heart complications that you may have, right? \nAt least, give this inspired butcher just one chance so that he can add to his multi-talented resume, can you not? \nTelestai: When the person appointed as the country's auditor-general has neither working experience nor knowledge in finance, accounting and auditing to the point of what-she-doesn't-know-can-fill-an-entire-bookshelf, you know the country is in deep trouble. \nHearse misuse will not recur, says Jamal \nAnonymous 2436471476414726 : Sungai Besar Umno chief Jamal Mohd Yunos, who else besides you have abused hearses recently? \nSurely the DYMM Tuanku Sultan is referring to your antics and no one else. The least you could do is apologise to DYMM, the government of Selangor, MB Azmin Ali, the mosque committees (for manipulating them) and to the people of Selangor. \nShow remorse. Repent. Stop trying to justify your stupid acts for it only expose your arrogant self and poor upbringing. You have done nothing but brought disrepute to the Muslim community. Shame on you! \nGI Joe: Jamal still claims that hearse can still be use as props if there is justifiable cause. His definition of \"misuse\" can be twist and turn to mean illegal means but legal means are allowable. \nYoong John Yen: Some things do not need to be said. It's called \"common sense\". It’s something that Jamal lacks in large quantities it seems. \nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers. Only paying subscribers can post comments.
