Playalinda's nudity is well known: \nSome come because its a regular habit. Others come because they've heard about it. What have they heard? That Playalinda beach is one of Florida's few nude beaches . They heard correctly. \nPlayalinda is located within the Cape Canaveral National Seashore and is a federally owned beach known for its great surfing. Whether by word of mouth or force of habit, this remote stretch of beach is also well known as a nude beach . \nOf course, what better way is there to beat Florida's heat than to take it all off. Just don't forget to pack your sunblock. Location, location, location: \nThe four miles of road that follows the beach for four miles gives out at the north end of Lot 13 and north of dune crossover 13B is where the fun really begins. On one side you have fishermen wearing straw hats and most are clad from head to toe in jeans and t-shirts. On the other, you have people who aren't wearing a stitch of clothing – happily baring everything with nothing left to the imagination. Will I be offended?: \nOver a mile of sand you will see naked people tanning areas that normally don't see the light of day. In Foghorn Outdoors' Florida Beaches , authors, Parke Puterbaugh and Alan Bisbort, report that a typical Saturday at the beach was statistically populated by approximately 100 people – 80% men and 20% women – including gay men, true naturists and heterosexual couples. Should I go? \nYou pretty much have to go out of your way to be offended, but if such activities typically offend you, don't go. Is it legal?: \nInformation presented on this page does not mean that Florida law allows nudity in public places. There is a Brevard County ordinance against nudity on the books, but it goes largely unenforced. If you're going to go nude, it's best to have a cover-up handy, just in case. Directions: \nFrom Interstate 95, take State Road 406 exit at Titusville. After crossing the Indian River, take a right fork onto State Road 402 and continue east to the beach. \nFrom Cocoa Beach, take Highway A1A north to State Road 528 and go west to State Road 3 and follow it north to State Road 402, then turn east (right) and proceed to the beach. Fees: \nEntrance to Cape Canaveral National Seashore is $5.00 per day, per vehicle, or $35.00 for an annual pass. The entrance fee for individuals entering on foot or on a bicycle is $3.00. Hours: \nHours for the Cape Canaveral National Seashore is 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Facilities:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:02:06.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
