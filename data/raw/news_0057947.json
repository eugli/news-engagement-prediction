On the day it happened, Waters was overheard shouting at Kyzer - who he had only had for four months - but he has not given a reason as to why he did it. There was so much blood on Kyzer, on his bedding and on a radiator inside the house. What Kyzer went through is stomach-churning. We hear of so many incidents of animal cruelty, but this is one of the more violent ones I have ever dealt with. Kyzer would have been terrified and in so much pain - he wouldn’t have stood a chance.”\n– RSPCA inspector Laura Bryant.
