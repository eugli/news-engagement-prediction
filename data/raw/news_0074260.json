With this gut type it may be advisable to avoid eating three large meals and opt for smaller more frequent meals until the gut is back in balance.' Foods to eat: Leafy green salads, apple cider vinegar mixed with warm water, pineapple, mango Foods to avoid: 'Cut down on pre-prepared and processed packaged foods.' STRESSED GUT A healthy, balanced microbiome - aka 'gut health' - helps us break down foods, protects us from infection, trains our immune system and manufactures vitamins, such as K and B12 (picture posed by model) The symptoms: Insomnia, wandering attention, low sex drive, inability to switch off. The diet: 'When the brain is constantly stimulated and on overdrive, our digestion gets put to one side. Balancing blood sugars by avoiding coffee, alcohol and refined white carbohydrates, and consuming more healthy proteins can help to keep stress hormones under control. 'Although many people with this gut type find it difficult to relax, their guts most likely wonâ€™t be optimal until they do take time out for themselves by taking up yoga, mindfulness or simply a hobby or exercise which they enjoyed as a child.' WHAT IS GUT HEALTH? We all have trillions of different microbes in our guts. The latest thinking is that this microscopic community, known as the microbiome, acts like an organ in the body, performing various vital functions. A healthy, balanced microbiome helps us break down foods, protects us from infection, trains our immune system and manufactures vitamins, such as K and B12. It also plays a role in regulating blood sugar and metabolism, and sends signals to our brain that can affect mood, anxiety and appetite. A bad diet, stress, alcohol and lack of sleep can upset your microbiome, creating imbalances that are increasingly being linked to conditions ranging from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to diabetes, high blood pressure, depression and obesity. Foods to eat: Grass-fed meats, wild salmon, nuts, seeds and pulses. Foods to avoid: 'Often a stressed gut type will rely on stimulants such as caffeine, alcohol, sugars and refined carbohydrate foods, such as pasta and bread to get them through the day.' CANDIDA GUT The symptoms: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), allergies, inflammatory skin conditions, joint pain, bad breath, brain fog, gas and bloating. The diet: 'Candida is a yeast that may be present in most healthy guts. However, in some circumstances, such as during antibiotic treatment, or a poor diet high in sugars and yeasts, candida will take the opportunity to grow and multiply. 'It is suggested that people with this gut type may have a cold and damp gut. Warming the gut could be a therapeutic goal, by consuming more warm foods such as stews, soups and warm fruits, and adding in spices, to help aid digestion and improve circulation. 'Balancing the microflora by increasing the good bacteria through fermented foods could help to limit the ability for candida and pathogenic bacteria to grow. Also, adding in anti-microbials, in the form of garlic and grapefruit, could further restrict the growth of candida.' Foods to eat: Soups, stews, turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, cayenne pepper, sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, probiotics, green tea, garlic, grapefruit, hot water and lemon. Foods to avoid: Coffee and black tea. TOXIC GUT A bad diet, stress, alcohol and lack of sleep can upset your microbiome, creating imbalances - but you can avoid them by eating the right foods, such as salad with olive oil if you have a toxic gut Symptoms: Skin conditions including rosacea and eczema, gall bladder disease, dark circles under eyes. The diet: 'Excretion of toxins from the body can be improved by drinking two litres of filtered water each day and consuming more fibre rich foods Foods to eat: Olive oil on salads, filtered water, dark green leafy vegetables, oats, high-fibre supplement, herbal teas. Herbal teas such as dandelion or fennel may also help support liver and gall bladder function.' Foods to avoid: Fatty foods, anything from the bakery, fried foods, dairy. IMMUNE GUT Symptoms: IBS, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence. The diet: 'This is perhaps the most inflamed gut, resulting in leaky gut causing many food intolerances and allergies. 'Keeping a food diary could be of benefit to work out which foods are followed by symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain and flatulence. Keep in mind that a food intolerance may take several hours to cause symptoms. 'Often an elimination diet could be of benefit.' Foods to eat: Bone broth, cabbage soups, juices, fermented foods, probiotics. Foods to avoid: Gluten, dairy, eggs, fish, seafood, nuts, soy.
