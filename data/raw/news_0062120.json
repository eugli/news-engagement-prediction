Audio: Jill Bottral and Carina James speak about the NBN installs. (ABC News) \nNBN Co will be ending its contract with the interim service on Tuesday, February 28, so subscribers need to move to the new Sky Muster satellite service with one of the available providers. \nCarina James from Cow Creek Station, south of Mataranka, successfully switched to the new service earlier this month, but not before her technician became confused about where she lived. \nA neighbour was required to assist the helicopter pilot to locate the station homestead. \nShe said GPS coordinates were provided to NBN Co but were apparently not passed on correctly to the contractor. \n\"Whatever coordinates they had received by their upper-management, didn't match with this location, so they went to the wrong place,\" she said. \n\"It took a fair bit of flying, I don't know, but it took them much longer than they wanted and it really put them out because they had to go and refuel before they went back to Katherine. \n\"It was not much fun for the pilot and the technician because they've got a timetable in trying to get everybody done.\" \nMrs James said the installers did a good job once they arrived, but were let down by the organisations in charge. \n\"They want to do quality work,\" she said. \n\"They can't really be expected to make a silk purse out of sow's ear if they can't get the information from above them to make it happen. \n\"They managed to achieve a very good job, got the install done properly in a very short period of time, and did well to get it done while avoiding the rain.\" \nWhile the contractor managed to finally locate Cow Creek Station, NBN Co is not having has much luck with dozens of other properties that need to switch to the new satellite service. \nNBN Co Northern Territory corporate affairs manager Jill Bottral said the company had been attempting to ensure anyone who wants to maintain an internet connection, upgrades their infrastructure. \nShe said representatives had tried to visit current subscribers to encourage them to arrange an appointment with a contractor. \n\"When we've been sending people out to some of these locations where their addresses are, we are finding empty fields or ramshackle buildings that are no longer occupied,\" she said. \n\"Or we've been finding just a couple of dogs in a yard but we haven't been actually finding a satellite service anywhere. \n\"It's been quite interesting when we actually start to door-knock these final 50 [interim satellite users]. \n\"We suspect that a lot of the people that formerly had that service have moved on.\" \nWith around 40,000 users in Australia moving to the Sky Muster satellite, Ms Bottral said it was a rare circumstance not to be able to locate an individual user. \nABC Rural has contacted the NBN installer contracted for the work at Cow Creek Station for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:50:29.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
