His dad worked in the oil patch … \n“It’s in my blood,” the 32-year-old told Postmedia this week from Kelowna, B.C., where he is representing Canada at the World Para Snowboard Championships. “Working on the rigs was the most rewarding job I ever had. When you’re standing in the pumphouse of a drill rig and the pumps are going, you swear the rig has a heartbeat. I’ll never speak poorly of working on the rigs. I loved it.” \nThat love endures despite what the rig took from him on Aug. 17, 2006. Working as a derrickhand some 25 stories in the air, Shoemaker was thrown into a giant wheel that shredded his right arm — from the hand to his shoulder — one five-centimetre chunk at a time. \nWith the wheel coming towards his head, Shoemaker grabbed a handrail and pulled himself out in two pieces. In shock, he bit off his left glove and plugged the exposed arteries with oil-stained fabric to stem the bleeding. Somehow, he remained conscious throughout the two hours it took for the ambulance to arrive at the worksite north of Grand Prairie. \n“I was just lying on the rig floor waiting to die, more or less,” he said. “I didn’t really think I was making it out of there alive.” \nForty-five days later, he walked out of the hospital — after flatlining twice — determined to make the most of a life nearly lost. \n“I remember this old nurse in the hospital,” he said. “After I came out of the coma, she told me, ‘Either you’re going to make something of your life, or you’re not. Get over it or don’t.’ I just clued in that the only person who was going to stop me was me. I was blessed with another arm so let’s make the best of it.” \nAnd make the best of it, he does. Two months ago, Shoemaker represented Canada at the World Adaptive Surfing Championship in La Jolla, California. And this weekend, he’s ripping down the mountain on behalf of Canada in snowboard cross and banked slalom at the world championships. \nAthletes from roughly 17 countries are competing at Big White in what serves as a dress rehearsal for the 2018 Winter Paralympics in PyeongChang, South Korea. \nThe speed is high. The moves are quick. The terrain features, gnarly. \n“For me, my main challenge is counter-balance, because it’s my back arm missing,” said Shoemaker, who crashed in training Thursday but still hopes to compete. “Starting from the top, when I’m pulling out of the start gates, I don’t get as good of a pull. Also when you pull out with one arm, you’re off balance and when you’re airborne, it’s also a balance issue.” Related Canada’s Roseline Filion — ‘the most underestimated athlete in diving’ — retires as two-time Olympic medallist \nDetermined to return his life to a normal balance after the accident, Shoemaker went back to work in the oil industry as a field safety coach based in Calgary. \nOn days off, he escaped to the Rockies where he started big mountain riding and heli-boarding as often as possible. \nThrough word of month, Canada Snowboard heard about the rising star of the backcountry. When he called to inquire about joining the team, the coaches invited him to a tryout in Kelowna. \nIn 2014, the former derrickhand became Canada’s first national champion in the upper limb category. He went on to finish ninth at the 2015 world championships in Spain. \nLooking back, Shoemaker sees his near-death experience as a minor obstacle compared to the one that followed. In 2010, his dad died of a heart attack at age 52 while working on the rigs in Yemen. His body arrived home on his parents’ 25th wedding anniversary. \n“It was probably the biggest struggle,” Shoemaker said. “It was far harder to lose him than the arm. But as I always tell people, when life throws you a curveball, the only thing that’s going to stop you is you.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:22:18.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
