Users of the Facebook group ‘JoJo Maman Bebe Pre-Loved Buy and Sell’ took offence, with some even declaring that they would stop buying her brand. Used on Facebook: JoJo website photos Pam Le Sueur, from Jersey, wrote: ‘We can all be quite nuts at times and pay over the odds for your second hand clothes, but hey that should be a massive compliment and show how much we love your clothes. ‘What amazes me is the tone of your message. You should consider us to be akin to a fan club... you have just single-handedly p****d off probably about 18,000 of them with your rude message... We, your fans, are disheartened and sad and left confused.’ Laura Youds described Miss Tenison’s post as an ‘outburst’ which was ‘incredibly rude’ and an ‘epic PR fail’. Kate Bell, from Cheshire, wrote: ‘Being spoken to like children leaves a bad taste’, and Zoe Lawrence said: ‘The attitude and tone is pretty offensive and snotty.’ A glance at the Facebook page yesterday showed a JoJo fleece-lined snowsuit for a 9 to 12-month-old on sale for £22, while a similar item on the JoJo Maman Bebe website is available new at a sale price of £31.20, discounted from £39. A JoJo pinafore dress for age two to three years is on Facebook for £13 and on the company website new for £20, while a ‘well worn, slightly faded’ maternity jumper is on Facebook for £10 with a shot taken from JoJo Maman Bebe’s website saying the product costs £29 new. Miss Tenison’s Facebook post has since been deleted. Miss Tenison’s Facebook post has since been deleted. Yesterday she told the Daily Mail that she sent the message to the Facebook group’s public forum by mistake The businesswoman founded her company as a mail order catalogue in 1993, also selling maternity clothes, and was awarded an MBE for services to business in 2003. It now has 80 stores with an annual turnover of £50million. Yesterday Miss Tenison told the Daily Mail that she sent the message to the Facebook group’s public forum by mistake, having meant to send it to the site’s moderators only. ‘Late-night posting is never a good idea,’ she added. ‘I had just come back from watching Trainspotting 2. I’m human and I made a mistake.’ An example of one of the posts on the Facebook page In a new post on the group’s Facebook page yesterday, she apologised to members and said: ‘You are wrong if you think I am condescending towards this group. I LOVE IT.’ The new post added: ‘I do apologise about my comment on the selling prices on your group. 'Of course it is up to you to pay what you like but I often see prices which are higher than our sale prices, plus you pay postage! I do think this is a bit daft – but it’s up to you and I accept none of my business.’ Referring to the issue over photos, she said: ‘We have to protect our models. They sign a model release agreement for our use and not others.’ The photos which she complained about have since been removed from the Facebook page. She also asked the group’s members to consider her firm’s ‘A Mother To Another’ recycling initiative if they failed to sell their items. ‘We have a big campaign to collect up good quality clothes (not just JoJo) and make them into gorgeous packs for a mother in need. We cover all the costs to check, sort and deliver to refugees in the camps along the Syrian border or via the Trussell Trust food banks in the UK,’ she said.
