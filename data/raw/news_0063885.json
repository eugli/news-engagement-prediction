They are also seeking seven other North Koreans wanted in connection with the case, including a diplomat at the embassy in Kuala Lumpur. \nSouth Korean and U.S. officials have said they believe North Korean agents assassinated Kim Jong Nam, who had been living in the Chinese territory of Macau under Beijing’s protection. \nREAD MORE: Suspects in killing of Kim Jong-un’s brother wiped toxin on his face: police \nNorth Korea is believed to have the world’s third-largest stockpile of chemical weapons, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative project, which analyses weapons of mass destruction. \nSouth Korean analysts have identified sarin and VX as the focus of the North Korean chemical weapons program. \nPolice said swabs taken from the eye and the face of the North Korean murder victim revealed the presence of VX nerve agent, or S-2 Diisoprophylaminoethyl methylphosphonothiolate. \nIn this May 4, 2001, file photo, a man believed to be Kim Jong Nam, the eldest son of then North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, looks at a battery of photographers as he exits a police van to board a plane to Beijing at Narita international airport in Narita, northeast of Tokyo.

In later clips he is seen asking airport officials for medical help, and rubbing his eyes and stumbling as he entered an airport clinic. He died on the way to hospital. Most toxic nerve agent \nVX is tasteless and odorless, and is outlawed under the Chemical Weapons Convention, except for “research, medical or pharmaceutical purposes”. \nIt can be manufactured as a liquid, cream or aerosol. Experts said VX has no commercial uses. \n“This is not something you make in a kitchen lab.” \n“This is something that is made in a very sophisticated chemicals weapons lab,” said Bruce Bennet, a senior defense researcher at the California-based RAND Corporation. \nVX in liquid form can be absorbed into the body through skin or eye contact and does not evaporate easily so it can persist in the environment. After giddiness and nausea, exposure to VX quickly progresses to convulsions and respiratory failure before death, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \nAbsorbed in large doses, it is fatal after 15 minutes, according to the U.S. Army’s Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, making it the world’s most toxic known nerve agent. \nIn 2015, traces of sarin and VX nerve agent were found at a military research site in Syria that had not been declared to the global chemical weapons watchdog. Suspects wanted \nMalaysian authorities on Thursday requested Interpol to put an alert out to apprehend four North Korean suspects who are believed to have fled Malaysia on the day of the attack. \nThey also want to question the second secretary at the North Korean embassy, though he has diplomatic immunity, and are seeking two other North Koreans, including an employee at the state-owned airline Air Koryo, who are still believed to be in Malaysia. \nThe investigation has resulted in fraught relations between two countries that had hitherto maintained friendly ties. \nIn this image made from Feb. 13, 2017, airport closed circuit television video and provided by Fuji Television, Kim Jong Nam, second from right, exiled half-brother of North Korea\\’s leader Kim Jong Un, walks with an airport security official towards a medical clinic, top right, after he was attacked at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Malaysia.
