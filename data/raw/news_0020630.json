Lee Hughes joined Worcester City in September 2015 Former West Brom striker Lee Hughes has applied to be the new boss of National League North side Worcester City. \nThe 40-year-old has told BBC Hereford & Worcester that he would be interested in succeeding the long-serving Carl Heeley, who stood down last week after 22 years' service. \nHughes is keen to carry on playing and said: \"I just love scoring goals. \n\"But I'd be up for it. I've spoken to the board about it, outlined my ideas to them and we'll see what they think.\" \nHughes, who has scored 33 goals in 57 appearances since signing for Worcester in September 2015, intends to start doing his Football Association coaching qualifications this summer. But he hopes that, for now, his vast experience as a player, both on and off the field, will count for something. \n\"I've played with some top quality managers and I've learnt a lot from them,\" said Hughes, who has had 28 bosses (not including caretaker managers) in his 22 years in the game. \n\"I had six or seven in two years at Notts County. I'm well used to managers coming and going. You just have to get on with it.\" \nHomeless Worcester, in their first season sharing Bromsgrove Rovers' Victoria Ground after three seasons as Kidderminster Harriers' tenants, currently stand 18th in National League North, three points clear of the relegation zone. Career moves \nSmethwick-born Hughes began his career with Kidderminster Harriers in 1995, before making his name at West Bromwich Albion. \nIt led to his biggest career move, when Gordon Strachan signed him for newly-relegated Coventry City for Â£5m in 2001. \nHe was only with the Sky Blues for a year, at second tier level, before returning to the Hawthorns to help Albion win promotion to the Premier League in 2002. \nBut his career was then put on hold for three seasons when he was sent to prison in August 2004 for causing death by dangerous driving. \nHe returned to play in the lower reaches of the Football League, still proving a prolific scorer with Oldham, Notts County and Port Vale before dropping down to non-league football in January 2014 with Forest Green, Harriers, Ilkeston, and eventually Worcester.
