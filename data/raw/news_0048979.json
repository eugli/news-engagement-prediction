Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA woman with an extremely rare condition causing her to constantly smell like fish has revealed the extraordinary lengths she goes to get through life. \nKelly Fidoe-White has lived her entire life with Trimethylaminuria - a disorder more commonly known as \"fish-odour syndrome\". \nPeople suffering with the metabolic condition regularly produce a range of strong bodily odours including rotten fish, onion and faeces. \nKelly, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, describes her own smell as \"fishy-oniony\".

Kelly Fidoe-White (Photo: Barcroft Media) \n\"I was spending a stupid amount of time in the shower just before my diagnosis. Using red hot water, scrubbing until my skin was bright red and it was just too stressful.\" \nKelly's mother, Sandra Fidoe, added: \"The fact that she was bullied about it made it ten times worse for her and certainly for me. It bothered me.\" \nKelly started seeing a doctor in her late teens, but nobody could diagnose her. After researching her symptoms and watching documentaries, she pushed doctors for an answer and was diagnosed with Trimethylaminuria in 2015.

I've just kept it to myself. Kelly Fidoe-White with her work colleagues Faysal and Asha (Photo: Barcroft Media) \n\"When we were living together at the start I did notice it. But it wasn't straight away when we first started seeing each other - it was never a problem. \n\"I don't believe she tired to hide it either. \n\"Kelly wasn't that confident when we first met - and I think the best way of me helping her with the condition is to just be supportive about the condition. \n\"If that was me living with the condition, I think I would struggle to do as much as Kelly does.\" \nKelly added: \"Michael has helped me to cope by making me see the funny side of the condition. \n\"I am sure he won't mind me saying this, but he produces his own smell anyway!\" \nSince working night shifts at The Royal Oldham Hospital, Kelly has recently been more open and honest about her condition with her closest work colleagues. \nFaysal Bashir works alongside Kelly as a CT/MR radiographer.

It's quite a strong, distinct smell you get from Kelly. \n\"When Kelly told me about her condition I didn't take it in for some reason and so I have always called it 'fishiyatitus.' \n\"I have had many complaints about Kelly's smell to me and from a variety of staff in the department. \n\"It's hard when you get these complaints as Kelly is a good friend. \n\"But working with Kelly for two years as my night buddy means we have a good communication where I could tell her to go and freshen up.\" \nAsha Feroz, a diagnostic radiographer who also works with Kelly, said: \"Certain people do make comments.

So it doesn't affect my work at all.\" \nAs much as Kelly's friends and family have helped her through the hardships she has faced in life, it was the final diagnosis she received that allowed her to start accepting the condition with a sense of closure. \nAnd now Kelly feels confident enough to raise awareness and speak about her condition in the hope that she can destigmatise it and people can tell her what is working to calm the smell. \nKelly said: \"From watching documentaries, things to started to fall into place and it sounded like it could be me when someone said it's not just a fish odour. \n\"And ultimately I ended up being tested and it came back positive. \n\"I am more chilled about it now. I can't say that if somebody complains tomorrow, I wouldn't still find it a little bit cutting. \n\"But I deal with it by educating that person now.\" Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T13:16:13.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
