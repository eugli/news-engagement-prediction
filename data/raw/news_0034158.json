Münich, Vilnius and Lisbon have expressed their interest, as has Vaasa, a mid-sized city on the western coast of Finland. Ad \nThis week, The Finnish Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (TEM) announced a lobbying campaign to make Vaasa its \"center foward\" in the bout for the Gigafactory, said Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä to Di Digital. \nLintilä has also said Tesla is very interested in Vaasa, according to Seeking Alpha. \nTesla is yet to make an official announcement on the matter, but according to Taloussanomat another Finnish minister met with Tesla representatives in Norway last week. Tesla's batteries are currently produced in its Gigafactory in Nevada, US. \nGreater Vaasa, with some 120,000 inhabitants, has a big Swedish-speaking community and is best known for its universities and its industrial cluster, led by global companies like Wärtsilä and Vacon. \nSeveral other regions in Finland have been considered internally. The Hamina-Kotka region on the southern coast has criticized the government's preference for Vaasa.
