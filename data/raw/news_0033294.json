It begins with a close-up of a veteran doing squats with a heavy barbell. As the camera pulls back, it reveals he only has one leg, the other having been amputated above the knee. During his workout, the vet’s voiceover reads the following message aloud: \nPresident Trump, I hear you watch the morning shows. Here’s what I do every morning. Look, you lost the popular vote, you’re having trouble drawing a crowd and your approval rating keeps sinking. But kicking thousands of my fellow veterans off their health insurance by killing the Affordable Care Act, and banning Muslims, won’t help. That’s not the America I sacrificed for. You want to be a legitimate president, sir? Then act like one. RELATED Dear SNL : Please Bring Cecily Strong Back to Weekend Update \nThe group first announced its intent to reach Trump — who seldom seems to miss NBC’s “not funny,”“really bad” SNL — in a series of tweets: Hey @realDonaldTrump – remember us? Since you won’t meet with vets at the WH, we’re airing this ad on #SNL this weekend to get on your TV. pic.twitter.com/ORNXbubx11 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T15:56:42.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
