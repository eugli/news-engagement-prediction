If passed, foster parents would be trained to treat and gender trans children based on trans children’s presenting gender identity. \nTristan Torres, a 19-year-old trans activist, testified in support of the bill on Monday. He explained that his foster mother repeatedly misgendered him, blamed his transitioning for being bullied, and prevented him from spending time with her children, the Las Vegas Sun News reports . As a result, Torres contemplated suicide. \nNow out of the foster system, Torres hopes that passing the bill will help LGBTQ minors feel protected and heard on a state level. \n“We have to show through this bill’s passage that that we know [LGBTQ foster children] exist and we want to help them,” Torres said. \nThe Nevada state government had previously sponsored and discussed legislation to support LGBTQ youth. In 2015, the Nevada Legislature passed an anti-bullying initiative , protecting Nevada students from harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The law was applauded by such LGBTQ organizations as the Human Rights Campaign and GLSEN. \nBut Assembly Bill 99 would focus specifically on protections for LGBTQ youth across the foster system. Which, according to Araujo, are largely missing from Nevada laws. \n\"Nevada does have comprehensive discrimination laws but they do not specifically address child welfare,\" Araujo explained in committee. \"[Foster children] face discrimination, neglect, and abuse from the very institutions meant to protect them. This is why today we are here to discuss AB99.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:24:47.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
