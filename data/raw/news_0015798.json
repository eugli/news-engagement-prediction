Key points: The Government is preparing to spend $17 billion on 72 F-35 aircraft Howard government decided to join multi-billion dollar JSF program at the US' invitation Donald Trump blasted project tweeting F-35 cost blowouts were \"out of control\" \nThe ABC has confirmed the F-35 will be the star attraction at the Avalon Air Show to be held outside Melbourne at the end of February. \nAn official familiar with planning for the event said secrecy surrounding the cutting-edge technology on the JSF had complicated arrangements, including finding a suitable hangar for the aircraft. \nThe Federal Government is preparing to spend $17 billion on 72 F-35 aircraft, with the first expected to be delivered to Australia in 2018 and enter service in 2020. \nIn 2002, the Howard government decided to join the multi-billion dollar JSF program at the invitation of the United States, but its progress has been plagued by controversy and cost blowouts ever since. \nIn December, US President Donald Trump blasted the project, tweeting the cost blowouts associated with the Lockheed Martin aircraft were \"out of control\" and vowing to save billions of dollars in military purchases when he came into office. \nShortly after Mr Trump's comments, Defence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne insisted the JSF was the right option for Australia and the US. \n\"We're very confident that the JSF is the right jet for Australia and for the United States and rest of the world,\" Mr Pyne told reporters in London. \nLast year, Royal Australian Air Force Chief Leo Davies launched a strident defence of the controversial multi-billion-dollar JSF program , insisting he had \"absolutely no reservations\" it was the right aircraft to replace the Classic Hornet.
