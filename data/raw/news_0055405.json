Halifax has two dodgeball leagues: the Halifax Sports and Social Club and Nova Scotia Dodgeball.\nThe 2004 movie Dodgeball, with Ben Stiller, has helped boost the sport's popularity, Julie DiCicco says. (20th Century Fox)\nIn New Brunswick, however, fans of the sport have felt the sting of rejection.\n\"Right now in New Brunswick, there is really no dodgeball,\" said Julie DiCicco, 26, a competitive player before she moved to Saint John from Halifax in August.\nShe's hoping to change that with this Thursday's Drop-In Dodgeball Night at UNB Saint John.\nThe rules are easy to follow.\n\"You have six players on each side, and throw a ball to try and get somebody out,\" DiCicco said. \"If you catch a ball, you get the person who threw it out. Then somebody else can come back in.\n\"You play as many matches as you can within a certain timeframe, and that's a game.\"\nTaking aim: Popularity of dodgeball exploding on P.E.I. Nova Scotia Dodgeball aims for national tournament Yeah, but does it hurt? While the game has historically been beloved by bullies, DiCicco said the seven-inch regulation balls are much lighter than the rubber balls you might remember from gym classes.\n\"They're quite squishy,\" she said. \"They can sting a bit, but they don't hurt.\"\nSome players choose to wear kneepads to protect their joints from crazy dives, but other than that, DiCicco said, no special gear is required.\nPlayers don't necessarily need to be superstar athletes, either.\n\"A lot of people who might not have the co-ordination to play other sports are actually really good at dodgeball,\" said DiCicco.\n\"It can actually be an advantage if you've never played baseball or other throwing sports, because you'll use your entire body to throw. Which, in this case, is good.\"\nAmong those trying out the game at a recreational tournament in Saint John last fall were Corey Pendleton, Balder Almansor, Erica Forward and an identified dodegballer. (Stephanie Guimond)\nCasual, ball-whipping fun Luke Tudor, 33, of Saint John is a dodgeball newbie, having tried it just once, at a recreational tournament this fall. He plans on trying out his skills at the drop-in night.\n \"It was a lot more fun than I thought it would be,\" Tudor said. \"I remember it being very chaotic as a kid and no one knowing the rules — but the league rules are easy to follow. And it's less painful than, say, paintball.\"\nThe drop-in night will offer a chance to try different styles of game-play, including a \"free-for-all\" variation known as cougarball, said DiCicco.\n\"We'll split up the teams and have a casual session to explain the rules — nothing intense,\" she said.\n\"Hand-eye co-ordination, reflexes, all of that is key. But if you like just whipping balls, you'll enjoy it — and you'll be good.\"\nDrop-In Dodgeball Night in Saint John happens from 8:30 p.m to 10 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 23, at UNB Saint John.
