Iverson scored 29 points and had five fouls in the 76ers' 90-85 win. (Photo: Associated Press) \nAfter Kyrie Irving's guest appearance that made a lot of headlines , Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye's Road Trippin' podcast welcomed fairly new Cavalier Kyle Korver on the show. \nKorver started his NBA career on the Philadelphia 76ers with Hall of Famer Allen Iverson, so of course he had to share a story about the legend. The way the 35-year-old told the story is amazing - complete with an Iverson impersonation. \nThis all starts around the 26-minute mark. Korver talks about how fantastic and encouraging Iverson was to him, and then dives into the story of the time he witnessed \"the best interview I have ever heard in my whole life\" - even better than the famous \"practice\" interview, he says (a transcription is below, if you'd rather read than listen). \nhttps://www.omnycontent.com/w/player/?orgId=dad89834-a3a4-4210-bd33-a70500fce38a&programId=13580ce2-b3d6-4cad-ab7c-a70500fd5891&clipId=cf80ed15-8e7a-4d76-8d73-a72200c77154 \nKorver says (Jefferson, Frye and host Allie Clifton laugh for a good portion of this): \n\"For All-Star break, coach (Chris) Ford was like, 'If you're not back for practice at a certain time, you're not gonna start the next game.' He was really talking to A.I., the rest of us were gonna be there. A.I. just didn't come at all. The next game was our game in Denver, and coach Ford was just like, 'You're not gonna start,' and he was like, 'I'm not gonna play,' and he was like, 'OK' â€¦ \n\"So we're in this gym, he comes up to do his interview, so I'm behind him pretending like I'm shooting baskets because I want to hear everything that he's saying. I'm shooting like two-foot shots just working on my form so I can hear him. He's like (Korver does his best Iverson voice), 'I don't know no former eight-time scoring champ that come off the bench. I don't know no former 10-time All-Star that come off the bench. I don't know no former MVP that come off the bench. I don't know no former Olympian that come off the bench.' \n\"And this dude read off his whole resume right off. (Korver does his Iverson voice again) 'Why is it always Allen Iverson's fault?' I was like, 'This is amazing!' And it got no love. It wasn't picked up on SportsCenter or anything. I was like this is the best interview I have ever heard in my whole life.\" \nThen, Jefferson chimed in recalling how Spurs coach Gregg Popovich made Tim Duncan come off the bench in response to that specific Iverson rant. \nHere's a clip of the interview Korver is talking about: \nPretty amazing. Just imagine being a rookie in the NBA and hearing Iverson talk to the media like that. It's not surprising that he can almost remember it word-for-word 10-plus years later.
