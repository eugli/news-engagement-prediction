If travelers continue to shun France in favor of other destinations , it could soon be overtaken by the United States as the world's most popular tourist destination. \nTraveler spending in the country also slumped 6.6% in 2016 following a drop of 5.4% in 2015, according to preliminary data from the UNWTO. Spending in 2016 is expected to be significantly lower than its recent peak of $58 billion in 2014. France has been officially in a \"state of emergency\" since the deadly Paris attacks in November 2015. \nParis is among the five most visited international cities in the world with more than 15 million international tourists each year, according to research firm Euromonitor International. \nAnd the Louvre, with its famed glass pyramid entrance, is among the most popular museums in the world. \nHowever, Louvre attendance has fallen by 21% over the past two years. Just 7.3 million people visited the museum in 2016 compared to 9.3 million in 2014. \nMuseum officials say the decline is \"primarily due to the consequences of the terror attacks in 2015 and 2016 and to the museum's four-day closure during the flooding of the Seine in early June of 2016.\" \nRelated: Barcelona trying to tame tourism crunch \nThe latest incident is especially bad news for Parisian hotels, which have been offering deals to lure in travelers. \nAbout 45% of tourism spending in the city goes towards accommodation, a higher proportion than any other major tourist destination, according to data from MasterCard. \n-- Laura Goehler, Lindsay Isaac and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.
