Richards Congress Avenue Bridge. They usually start to emerge from the bridge around 20 minutes before sundown. Scroll down for a listing of typical sunset times in Austin by month. Austin Bats Parking \nThe most convenient parking lot is right next to the bridge near the Austin American-Statesman office at 305 South Congress Avenue. The fee is $7 for up to four hours. If you don’t mind walking, though, there is a free lot about 1/4 mile to the west next to the South 1st Street bridge. This lot is primarily used by walkers and joggers visiting the Lady Bird Lake Hike and Bike Trail and Auditorium Shores. It’s busy, but people also come and go frequently. You can park here for only two hours, but that should be plenty of time for bat viewing if you arrive just before sundown. The bats generally take about 45 minutes to fully emerge from the bridge. \ncontinue reading below our video Tips for Taking Better Travel Photos There are also smaller free lots along Riverside Drive. Best Viewing Sites \nThe walkway on the east side of the Congress Avenue bridge offers the best vantage point for watching the bats emerge and fly eastward over Lady Bird Lake. The hillside below the bridge is a little more kid-friendly since you can spread out a blanket and even have a picnic while you wait. From this perspective, you’ll get a close-up view as they emerge, but then they quickly disappear over the trees that border the lake. Also, on the hillside, you do run a slight risk of being bombarded by a little bat pee or poop (aka guano). It’s rarely more than a sprinkle, but it does happen. \nWith just a little advance planning, though, you can get an even better view from the water. You can rent kayaks and canoes by the hour from several businesses along the shoreline. Some of them even provide knowledgeable guides who share fun facts about the bats as you paddle. Capital Cruises also has two large tour boats for groups. Peak Bat Season \nIn June, the mom bats of this species of Mexican free-tailed bats (scientific name: Tadarida brasiliensis ) give birth to one tiny pup. The pups feed from mammary glands located under the mother’s wings, not on the chest as in most mammal species. \nThe pups are usually ready to fly by mid-August, which means the black cloud of bats emerging from the bridge is even more impressive during this time. In fact, the size of the colony virtually doubles because almost all of the bats that roost at the bridge are female. The males of the species don’t play any role in child rearing and usually roost in separate colonies. Why Do the Bats Roost Here? \nA redesign of the bridge in 1980 created crevices on the underside of the structure that were the perfect size for cozy bat homes. At the time, many Austin residents despised and feared the bats and tried to have the colony eradicated. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed, and now Austinites love their bat colony. They also welcome the flying mammals’ voracious diet. The bats consume up to 20,000 pounds of bugs nightly. Where to Eat Before or After \nSeveral restaurants near the bat bridge offer a wide range of dining options for every budget. If it’s comfort food you’re craving, Threadgill’s World Headquarters is walking distance from the bridge.
