I am lucky’ Panthers throw support behind Jordan\nFriendly oztag games helping to keep youth off the streets have been put on hold after Blacktown Council told the group to pay up or move on.\n‘Mounty County Wolfpack’ organiser Osselan Tupai has been told to stop the free afternoon friendly games, which are not competitive, at Emerton’s Popondetta Park or apply to hire the grounds.\nThe group, MCW Tag, which can attract up to 100 people and NRL stars such as Tyrone May from the Penrith Panthers, the Canberra Raiders’ Blake Austin and the Eels’ Suaia Matagi, aims to keep kids off the streets and having fun with people their own age.\nNRL stars join MCW tag initiative 1:56 Players often get involved in friendly Oztag games held at Popondetta Park, Emerton to help keep youths off the street.\nNovember 16th 2016 3 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/ NRL stars join MCW tag initiative Games have been called off since late last year for fear of legal action.\nThe letter, sighted by The Standard , said council had “concerns”, as the “organised tag league” had not approached council for approval, provided public liability insurance proof, nor had it paid any fees.\nIt also said the group failed to meet requirements for sporting clubs, which included noting its affiliation with a state sporting organisation and providing business plans, and stated police might be called if no arrangements were made with council.\nmedia_camera Some of the Mounty County Wolfpack, including their youngest members, pictured before they were ordered off the field by council.

Picture: Justin Sanson\nParramatta Eels signing Suaia Matagi has been an avid participant, playing daily in the off-season.\nThe respected footballer, who was jailed in his younger years and turned his life around with sport, told The Standard the initiative was beneficial for the region.\nBut Matagi, who would stop by the fields with his eight-year-old son, said taking the opportunity away from “the next generation” could prove problematic.\n“It’s sad ... what are these kids going to do now?” he said.\nmedia_camera Blake Austin playing with MCW tag in November.

Council’s policy is to give priority to those groups that have booked and paid fees.”\nThe spokesman said the council wanted to work with the group.\n“We have a solid record of working with sporting groups to make sure their needs are met,” the spokesman said.\nMr Tupai said: “It sucks it had to get to this ... all I care about is the boys being able to play in the park.”", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2f0355f94d7010a74652ecebdbc01356?width=650", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.css", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/a6993965f50467855c4bf1d251eee1fe?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storyheader/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/00f901b26d9b63abb11d9bf217edc674?width=650", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fthe-standard%2Fnews-story%2Fa6993965f50467855c4bf1d251eee1fe", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5aba81c68ab9b03475cc4a27fbccd548?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/the-standard", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/a6993965f50467855c4bf1d251eee1fe?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v2/origin:video_integrator.h4OGttNzE6ljJ1b8u09MXjpQwrMvNpGp?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2Fh4OGttNzE6ljJ1b8u09MXjpQwrMvNpGp%2Fpromo303532489&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ffe311c01ae942c7b9311087425935c2?width=316", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Oztag%20games%20forced%20off%20field&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fthe-standard%2Fnews-story%2Fa6993965f50467855c4bf1d251eee1fe", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0c1413148776c5c0d9c2647d4c208664?width=1024", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/a6993965f50467855c4bf1d251eee1fe?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storymeta/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d887fd7798912538254fdb53ce5c727b?width=316", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fthe-standard%2Fnews-story%2Fa6993965f50467855c4bf1d251eee1fe&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fthe-standard%2Fnews-story%2Fa6993965f50467855c4bf1d251eee1fe", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8921aa74f1a05a41b30df2af2b418ebb?width=650"], "published": "2017-02-06T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:19:59.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
