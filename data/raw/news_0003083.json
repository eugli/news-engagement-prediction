I found this breakdown on the internet and what it shows makes perfect sense. It is so much more expensive to buy a car than to rely on public transport. Now with private hire vehicles in the fray, it's like having a personal chauffeur to drive you wherever you please at a very economical price. \nIt is plain stupid to own a car in Singapore. It is tiring to drive and a waste of time to get stuck in the jam during morning and evening peak hour. The math do not lie, it cost 3 times as much to own a private car than it is to rely on public transport daily. Why continue to own a car to pollute the environment when you can save money and save our earth at the same time? \nI hope sillyporeans who still treat cars as status symbols to wake up their idea, no many how rich you are, you still die one day and none of the riches can be brought along. \nChin Hwee A.S.S.
