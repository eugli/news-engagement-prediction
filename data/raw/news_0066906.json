They're with me all the time,\" she said. \nLomu and Snap love their morning routine of coming down to the River Derwent before the sun is fully up. \n\"They're very keen to get out. They're obsessed,\" Ms Duffy said. \n\"As soon as the boats are launched, they'll jump in any boat. \n\"I think the girls love [having] the dogs around and I've got no doubt that that extra eye on them is an encouragement.\" \nThe dogs sit on the bow and watch what goes on and in the water, and they love to help motivate the rowers. \n\"The part that they really enjoy is when we're practising starts,\" Ms Duffy said. \n\"It's attention. Bark. Go! \n\"When the dogs think the girls are slacking off a bit, there's a bit more barking that goes on for a bit more encouragement.\" \nMs Duffy said she could not imagine coaching without the dogs now. \n\"I can't imagine anytime, even if I have to lift them up and carry them onto the boat. I'll do that.\" \nRower Jessica Hall said the dogs did help lift the rowers' effort. \n\"It really motivates you when you're tiring and you are really getting sick of it and you hear them encouraging and keep going on,\" she said. \nLomu and Snap have become a welcome feature of the rowing circuit in Tasmania. \n\"Everyone knows them around Tassie,\" said rower Poppy Newton. \n\"They're just always at the rowing regattas.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:22:16.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
