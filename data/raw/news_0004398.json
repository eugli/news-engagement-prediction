Out of this amount, about Rs 86,000 crore is for capital acquisition. Devoid of the pension outlay, the total defence budget for 2016-17 was Rs 2,49,000 crore. \n\nJaitley also said that a central defence travel system has been developed through which soldiers can book travel tickets online. A comprehensive web based defence pension distribution system for defence pensioners has also been developed. \n\nExperts had said at least a 10 per cent increase was needed to deal with inflation and the vast sums required to modernize India’s aging military hardware -- from Soviet era aircraft to outdated guns and body armor. \n\nIn the 2016-17 Budget, there was an increase of 11 per cent from the previous fiscal year, compared to an increase of 10.5 percent the year prior. \n\nThe government’s ability to spend has come under pressure repeatedly. The defence ministry has surrendered about Rs 35,000 crore from its capital allocation for the previous four years. \n\nIndia ranks fourth in the list of top 10 defence spenders in the world, according to an annual Jane's Defense Budgets Report. In the light of a rise in geopolitical tensions, there is a possibility of an increase in India’s defence Budget this year from $50.7 billion in 2016.
