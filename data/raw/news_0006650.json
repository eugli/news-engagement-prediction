Pilbara voters urged to reject candidate \nMs Edwards said she hoped Pilbara voters made their views clear to Mr Archibald. \n\"I hope they're very vocal in letting him know that those words and stigma are not acceptable,\" she said. \n\"I get really shocked that someone can talk with a sense that they understand the lived experience of being a single mother, you can only speak with that sense of authority if you've been one.\" \nKarratha resident Catherine told ABC North West WA she is a single mother who works long hours to support her children. \n\"There are lots of different situations and lots of families that needs support, not just single mums,\" she said. \n\"It's just about the children in general, and helping them no matter what the background is.\" \nAnother Karratha resident, Michelle, said she did not believe Mr Archibald's views would win votes in the Pilbara. \n\"Where is he coming from, where does he live?\" she said. \n\"That doesn't seem to be how we are here in Karratha, it just doesn't match this area, that's what I think.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:20:12.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
