Holiday giant Thomas Cook yesterday admitted that the average cost of its package holidays in Spain (pictured, stock image) for this summer is up by 9 per cent ‘We saw prices to Spain increase in 2016 as demand shifted from Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey into Western European favourites such as Italy, Greece and Spain. ‘Hoteliers capitalised on that increased demand, not just from the UK but across Europe, Russia and beyond. ‘They have done the same again this year and I have heard from some UK operators that Spanish hoteliers are looking to increase prices by a further 5-15per cent.’ Thomas Cook has seen a dramatic increase in sales of holidays to Greece. Booking are up by some 500,000 to reach 2.5m. THOMAS COOK UNDER FIRE OVER PAY DEAL FOR COMPANY BOSS Thomas Cook chief executive Peter Fankhauser faces pressure from shareholders over his pay deal. A quarter of shareholders voted against the company's pay plans last year and investor groups have voiced concerns this year over long-term incentive bonuses. The firm said in its annual report that share bonuses under a long-term plan had been cut from 200 per cent of base salary to 165 per cent after discussions with shareholders. But there are concerns over a clause that would allow Mr Fankhauser to claim up to 225 per cent of his £703,800 annual salary - a potential £1.6 million - according to investor group Institutional Shareholder Services. Mr Fankhauser declined to comment on his pay plans, which he said were drawn up by the group’s remuneration committee. Two years ago, Greece and the Greek Islands suffered a fall in sales at the height of the Syrian refugee crisis that saw thousands of desperate people landing on the country’s beaches. The country also suffered because of its economic and debt crisis which led the banks to ration access to cash. However, British families are apparently returning to Greece in force on the basis it is a safer option than Turkey, which has seen a series of terror attacks, and is also relatively cheap. Ironically, concerns about the Greek economy, the country’s massive debts and its ability to remain in the euro, have re-emerged this week. Thomas Cook said its sales for Greece this summer have leapt by 40per cent compared to 2016. Chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said: ‘In preparation for the Summer season, we have expanded our holiday offering to Greece and a number of smaller destinations across Europe, and I’m pleased that this early action is paying off. ‘Bookings to Greece are currently up by over 40per cent while demand for destinations such as Cyprus, Bulgaria, Portugal and Croatia is also strong. These positive trends are making up for continued weak demand for Turkey.’ Mr Fankhauser said the increase in prices in Spain was a ‘natural’ response to rising demand rather than evidence of greed by hoteliers. ‘We have strong relations with our hotel partners in Spain. There are reasonable increases given the market situation,’ he said. ‘We had very strong demand last year so it’s natural they are increasing the price.’ British families are apparently returning to Greece (pictured, stock image) in force on the basis it is a safer option than Turkey, which has seen a series of terror attacks Thomas Cook said there is no sign that Britons had generally been put off foreign holidays by the weakness of the pound, though this had seen a drop in demand for trips to the US. Holiday and flight sale income for the three months to the end of December was up 15 per cent to £1.62bn, largely due to currency movements. On an underlying basis, the figure rose 1 per cent. Despite the increase, pre-tax losses for the winter trading period, which is a tough part of the year for the travel industry, widened by 14 per cent to £135m after the group took on more borrowing. Mr Fankhauser warned the travel industry faces uncertain times this year. ‘We have made a solid start to the year, but it is still early days, and we remain cautious, given the uncertain political and economic outlook around the globe,’ he said. The City reacted by heavily marking down the company’s shares by as much as 9.5 per cent in the morning, before rebounding slightly. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘Times are tough in the European travel industry and Thomas Cook isn’t having the best of it, though the good news is things don’t seem to be getting any worse.’ Share or comment on this article 6", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:37:23.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
