Scared. Embarrassed” on the show. \nIf that figure is accurate, it’s a much larger financial windfall than was previously speculated: Earlier this month, Confidential reported that Arnold would be pocketing $40,000 a week for appearing on the show. $600k$700k Feed fam?

It’s the worst thing I’ve ever been through. I didn’t know it was going to be real, or I wouldn’t have signed up for it.” \nIn another post-show tweet, Arnold reflected that he actually had it better in the jungle than his Aussie campmates, as he was able to relax and be himself while the “Aussies had 2 put on a bit of a show 2 get more work.” \nWhen approached by news.com.au for comment on Arnold’s salary claims, a Ten spokesperson told us that “Network Ten does not disclose confidential contract details.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:43:17.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
