Ministers were forced to bring forward the proposed legislation after the Supreme Court ruled that Parliament's approval is needed before the Brexit withdrawal process can begin Share By Dan Bloom Mikey Smith Claire Miller Rob Williams 22:16, 1 FEB 2017 Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAfter a heated two-day debate this was the vote that brought Brexit a step closer. \nProposals to allow Theresa May to start formal Brexit talks have passed their first Commons test following overwhelming support from MPs. \nThe European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill was given a second reading by 498 votes to 114 - a majority of 384. \nThe legislation allows the Prime Minister to decide when to trigger Article 50 and therefore begin the two-year process of negotiation on Britain's withdrawal from the EU. \nA total of 47 Labour MPs defied orders from leader Jeremy Corbyn by voting against the Bill. \nMr Corbyn imposed a three-line whip on his MPs, which required them to support it. \nAn SNP-led wrecking amendment which attempted to stop the Bill from progressing was earlier defeated by 336 votes to 100, a majority of 236. \nThere were 33 Labour MPs who supported the SNP proposal, with six voting against, and 44 who opposed a motion outlining the future process for the Bill - which undergoes further scrutiny over three days from next Monday. \nThe votes came after more than 17 hours of debate. \nMinisters were forced to bring forward the proposed legislation after the Supreme Court ruled that Parliament's approval is needed before the Brexit withdrawal process can begin. \nThe Government wants this to start before the end of March. Search below to see how your MP voted What was the vote about? \nMPs voted on the \"second reading\" of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill on 1 February 2017. \nThis is where MPs vote for or against the general principle of a Bill. \nIt is not the final vote. That will be taken on 8 February after further scrutiny. \nThe Bill was introduced after the Supreme Court ruled MPs must vote on activating Article 50 - the trigger for Britain's two-year exit from the EU. \nIt is just two sentences long, and gives Theresa May authority to invoke Article 50. Which Labour MPs rebelled? \nJeremy Corbyn instructed his MPs to back Article 50 with a \"three-line whip\", the fiercest tool at his disposal. \nBut 47 of them defied a three-line whip. \nThat included 17 shadow frontbenchers and whips. Those who did not resign could now face reprisals: Rosena Allin-Khan (Shadow Sports Minister) Kevin Brennan (Shadow Minister for Arts and Heritage and Deputy Secretary of State) Lyn Brown (Shadow Policing Minister) Dawn Butler (Shadow Diversity Minister) Ruth Cadbury (Shadow Housing Minister) Thangham Debbonaire (Whip) Rupa Huq (Shadow Home Affairs Minister) Rachael Maskell (Shadow Environment Secretary) Stephen Pound (Shadow Northern Ireland Minister) Tulip Siddiq (Shadow Education Minister) Andrew Slaughter (Shadow Housing Minister, Shadow Minister for London) Jeff Smith (Whip) Jo Stevens (Shadow Welsh Secretary) Catherine West (Shadow Foreign Office Minister) Alan Whitehead (Shadow Minister for Energy and Climate Change) Daniel Zeichner (Shadow Transport Minister) (Photo: PA) \nJust Ken Clarke - who earlier in the week made a barnstorming speech. What does 'abstain' mean? \nIt means an MP was not present for the vote, but there can be many reasons. \nThe first is that they chose not to vote deliberately - often because they don't support a Bill, but don't want to be disciplined for voting directly against it. \nThe second is if they are ill. Sources said this included Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott, who was not present. \nThe third is if an MP is \"paired\" to one on the opposite side of the House who cannot attend due to illness. \nThere are others but this pretty much covers it.
