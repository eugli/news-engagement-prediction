Maybe you want to go skydiving? Or bungee jumping? Perhaps you want to buy yourself a suave motor, or go on holiday to the Bahamas. \nOne young girl has a bucket list, though it doesn't include any of the common desires above. It's, well... It's a little outlandish. And thoroughly enjoyable to read. \nTwitter user @Asbronaut recently found his sister's bucket list â€“ and found it rather intriguing. It is. It's incredible. \nAsbronaut, who goes by Josh and comes from Dallas, Texas, posted the list on Twitter. It features everything from \"eating a hammer head shark\" to \"sitting in an empty room for an hour\". \nThe girl's hopes and dreams aren't all bizarre. Trying the dance craze aerial silks and petting a cheetah are fairly regular. But staying asleep for 24 hours and petting a blob fish are less so. \nA lot of people have been enjoying the peculiar bucket list. She's an imaginative ten-year-old. Even Taco Bell was intrigued (maybe the company wants to help her tick a couple off). Indeed, we all really want to know what number ten is. We can't but think it'll be marvellous. Until then, here's the nine (with a couple of spelling corrections)... \n1. Eat a hammer head shark, snake, and bear \n2. Get a pet blob fish, koala, sloth, and 'flingo' \n3. Get a sign that says something in a different language, then on March 12, 2019, translate it \n4. Try aerial silks \n5. Sit in an empty room for an hour \n6. Eat ten Taco Bell Doritos tacos \n7. Win a Taco Bell Dorito taco eating contest \n8. Stay asleep for 24 hours \n9.
