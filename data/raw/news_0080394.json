To recall, the Mercury was briefly teased by the company in January at CES. TCL had however kept pricing and availability details under wraps, back then. Moreover, it had also kept the internal spec-sheet, as well as nomenclature, of the Mercury a closely-guarded secret.

It is powered by a 2GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor clubbed with Adreno 506 GPU and 3GB of RAM. The phone comes with 32GB of internal memory which is further expandable by up to 2TB via a microSD card slot. The phone is backed by a 3,505mAh battery with support for Quick Charge 3.0 (50 per cent charge in roughly 36 minutes). \nThe KEYone runs Android 7.1 Nougat out-of-the-box with BlackBerry's usual suite of security and productivity applications. Moving on, the KEYone sports a 12-megapixel camera -- a Sony IMX378 sensor -- on the rear with f/2.0 \"Large Pixel\" similar to the one on-board the Google Pixel. The rear camera can record 4K videos. On the front, the KEYone comes with an 8-megapixel camera with f/2.2 aperture.\nThe USP of the BlackBerry KEYone, as largely expected, is its full-scale physical QWERTY. Unlike the Priv (BlackBerry's last QWERTY phone) however, the KEYone features the physical keyboard in continuation with the touch screen. The design is old-school BlackBerry, which suggests that the phone might have been on the company's mind long before it hung its boots. \nThe QWERTY, just like it was in the Priv, supports touch-gestures like scrolling and Flick Typing for predictive texting, as also over 50 app shortcuts. The space bar, however, gets a new fingerprint scanner atop. The phone also comes with touch-based navigation keys. On the back, the KEYone sports a rugged material on top of metal. The BlackBerry logo graces the middle while a huge camera module with a dual-LED flash next to it, sits at the top. The module, however, sits flush into the body.

The volume rocker also lies on the right. On the left lies the power button. The phone also comes with a USB Type-C port for charging and data-syncing and speaker cut-outs on either side. \nThe KEYone will be available for buying globally starting from April at a price of $549 (roughly Rs 36,584).
