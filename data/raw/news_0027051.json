So, how do the goal statistics of the two best players in the world in the most prestigious competition in the world compare? Let's take a look. Article continues below Video: Twitter absolutely loves what Pep Guardiola said to Arter at full-time UEFA CL: Messi vs Cristiano \nAs it stands, the Portugual captain leads the all-time top scorers list with 95 goals from 133 games (compromising of Real and Man United appearances), compared to 93 goals in 111 matches for Messi. \nThat means that, while Ronaldo has scored two more goals than Messi, the Argentinian sensation has a better goals-per-game ratio of 0.84, in comparison to Cristiano's 0.71. \nThey've both scored 11 penalties each, they've both scored two Champions League final goals, but Messi just leads the way in terms of overall success, winning four European titles to Ronaldo's three (one at Man Utd, two at Real). Who will reach 100 CL goals first? \nMessi got past Raul's 71-goal record before Cristiano back in 2014 but, after topping the scoring charts with an incredible 16 goals last term as Real won their 12th European crown, Ronaldo became the overwhelming favourite to reach 100 goals first. \nHeading into this season, he was on 93 goals and Messi was ten behind on 83. However, he's endured a relatively slow start in this year's tournament, whereas Messi has been on fire for the Catalan giants. \nThe 32-year-old superstar has scored twice in six Champions League appearances this campaign, while Barca's 29-year-old magician is this year's top scorer with ten goals from just five matches. \nWhat's more, per Goal , Messi's three goals in Barcelona's 7-0 demolition of Celtic back in September saw him become the outright Champions League hat-tricks record-holder - something which he had shared with Cristiano. \nSo, as European battle recommences, Real's main man leads the way, but it really is too close to say who will become the Champions League's first goal centurion - Messi or Ronaldo. \nWho do YOU think will reach 100 Champions League goals first: Ronaldo or Messi?! Can either Real or Barca win it this season? Have YOUR say in the comments box below! \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
