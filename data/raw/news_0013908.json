Dillard also beat Ely earlier this season, 69-64, at Ely on Jan. 7.\nSenior Jordan Wright, who signed to play football at Kentucky on Wednesday, led Dillard with 18 points was named the MVP of the tournament. Senior Robert Johnson, who has signed with The Citadel, added 17 points, junior Bryce Oliver scored 13 and Florida State signee RaiQuan Gray had 11.\nDillard ran its record to 22-4 with victories over Nova High, Deerfield Beach and Ely in the Big 8. The Panthers' only loss to a Florida high school program this season came vs. Miami Christian on a 3-pointer in the final seconds at the AAA.\nSenior guard Geremy Taylor led Ely with 23 points and junior guard Michael Forrest had 14. The loss drops the Tigers to 22-6. Ely defeated Pines Charter and then Cardinal Gibbons to reach the finals.\nDillard went to the half with a 28-27 advantage on a 3-pointer from the top of the key by Wright. Wright led the Panthers at the half with nine points and Johnson had six. Gray was plagued by foul trouble (two fouls) and did not play in the second quarter. Gray finished the half with just four points.\nForrest connected on three 3-pointers to lead Ely with nine at the half and Calvin McCutcheon had six. Sophomore big man Josh Scott was also plagued by foul trouble – three – which proved to be key as Ely no longer has 6-4 forward William Maloney (grades). Scott managed just three free throws in the game.\nDillard won Big 8 championships in 2017, 2016, 2011, 2006, 2003, 2001 and 2000.\nEly won Big 8 championships in 2015, 2013, 2012 and 2010.\nThe All-Tournament Team was made up of Wright, Oliver and Gray from Dillard; Taylor and Forrest from Ely; Gertatus Urbonavicius, of Cardinal Gibbons; and Edwin Louis, of Deerfield Beach.\n Basketball", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-589692e2/turbine/fl-hs-bb-big8-final-0205-20170204"], "published": "2017-02-05T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:00:59.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
