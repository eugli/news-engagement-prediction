In a recent T20I against South Africa, Boult achieved the best figures by a New Zealand bowler - 2/8 in four overs. \n\nPAT CUMMINS (Rs 4.5 crore, Delhi Daredevils) \n\nThe former KKR fast bowler was snapped up by Delhi, who along with Rabada now have a formidable bowling attack. Cummins was one of seven marquee players with a base price of Rs 2 crore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T14:59:07.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
