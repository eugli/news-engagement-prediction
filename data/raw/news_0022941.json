It is quite a busy area at this time of night and there were a number of witnesses that police are still speaking with.\" \nHe said it was not clear if some of the group had been involved in both robberies, but there were six to nine people in two cars linked to both. At least one was a woman. \nThey were last seen travelling east on Kahikatea Dr towards Lake Rd. \nPolice are appealing to anyone who has seen the group, or the vehicles - a Mazda Demio and a 2000 black Mazda Familia with the registration ECR885 stolen from Chartwell - to call police immediately on 111. \n\"Both these cars were stolen locally and have been offending locally. They appear to be on to a crime wave so please help us to catch up with them before they can cause some more damage.\" \nAnyone with information can also call Hamilton police on 07 858 6200. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T15:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T10:32:42.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
