The Best Actress nominee said she was still waiting for an apology from the fashion designer, who said he regretted the \"controversy\" his comments had caused. \nOSCARS 2017: Everything you need to know - and how to watch for free \n\"In reference to Mr. Lagerfeld's 'statement,' there is no 'controversy': Karl Lagerfeld, a prominent designer, defamed me, my stylist, and the illustrious designer whose dress I chose to wear, in an important industry publication,\" Meryl said in a statement to PEOPLE . \"That publication printed this defamation, unchecked. Subsequently, the story was picked up globally, and continues, globally, to overwhelm my appearance at the Oscars, on the occasion of my record breaking 20th nomination, and to eclipse this honour in the eyes of the media, my colleagues and the audience.\" CLICK TO VIEW GALLERY Meryl Streep accused Karl Lagerfeld of defamation after his comments about her Oscars dress \nThe actress added: \"I do not take this lightly, and Mr. Lagerfeld's generic 'statement' of regret for this 'controversy' was not an apology. He lied, they printed the lie, and I am still waiting.\" \nOSCARS: Meet the stars' stylists \nMeryl's statement came after Karl told Women's Wear Daily on Saturday that he was mistaken in believing the Florence Foster Jenkins star was being paid to wear another brand. \"Chanel engaged in conversations with Ms. Streep's stylist, on her request, to design a dress for her to wear to the Academy Awards,\" he said in a statement. \"After an informal conversation, I misunderstood that Ms. Streep may have chosen another designer due to remuneration, which Ms. Streep's team has confirmed is not the case. I regret this controversy and wish Ms. Streep well with her 20th Academy Award nomination.\" Karl said he regretted the \"controversy\" his comments had caused \nEarlier in the week, the outspoken fashion designer told the same publication that his team had already started making a gown for Meryl when she changed her mind over what to wear. \"I made a sketch, and we started to make the dress,\" Karl said, claiming then that Meryl's team contacted him to say: \"'Don't continue the dress. We found somebody who will pay us.'\" What do you think?
