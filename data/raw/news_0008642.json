The idea of securitisation of parliament is false and doesn't have a foundation.\" \nHe added, however, that the SANDF, SAPS and State Security Agency had made their own plans and preparations. \n\"That's what they normally do in this event. They have a cluster they call JPCS cluster. \n\"We also want to highlight that really from our perspective, Sona is not about security. Freedom of movement of journalists in parliament? I think journalists in parliament have been guaranteed freedom of movement,\" said Mgidlana. \nHe assured journalists that no cellphone signals would be blocked and footage of proceedings would not be cut. \nThe Economic Freedom Fighters have written a letter to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, to demand that, instead of giving Zuma an opportunity to address the joint sitting, the date must be set aside to debate the \"failure\" by parliament to hold Zuma to account. \nEFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said the party also wanted a debate on \"the threat to our constitution and democracy of having Mr Zuma continue as president of the Republic of South Africa\". \n\"It is clear that the Speaker and the entire ANC caucus are hell-bent on rendering our constitution useless and ushering lawlessness in our country, which is a serious threat to our democracy,\" said Ndlozi.
