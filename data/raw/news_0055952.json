Going with her gut, she didn't remove the shirt immediately — which to many would seem like the natural thing to do — but instead got in her car and drove to a safe place before examining the situation more. \nWhat she found was disturbing. \"I used my windshield wipers to try to get them [sic] off but the shirt was completely wrapped around my wiper blade. . . . I don't know why the shirt was on my car but it had to have been intentional the way it was put on there,\" she said in a viral post she put on Facebook. \nHardacre, having heard from her parents that some people use tricks to lure women out of their cars and keep them distracted, recognized that what seemed like a random occurrence could actually be a dangerous situation. \"There were two cars near me and one was running so I immediately felt uneasy and knew I couldn't get out to get it off,\" she said on Facebook. ADVERTISEMENT \nHer post has been shared more than 90,000 times and brings to light a scary tactic potentially being used out there. Her story is a good reminder to always be aware of your surroundings, and if you feel unsafe for any reason, always go with your gut and trust your instincts — and get somewhere safer!
