The \"fee\" to correct it was £200. 'Trap' \n\"This printer helpline scam scam is particularly pernicious because it encourages victims to unknowingly contact the fraudsters of their own accord,\" said Mike Andrews, lead co-ordinator of the National Trading Standards eCrime team. \n\"While victims expect they will receive help with their printer problems, they have in fact been lured into a trap, and find themselves at risking of losing money or important personal information and also have their computer security compromised.\" \nIn 2016 there were more than 32,000 such cases of computer service fraud, according to Action Fraud, which is a 47% rise since 2014. How to protect yourself from printer scams Image copyright Thinkstock If seeking technical support for your printer, visit the manufacturer's website to get the official contact details Be suspicious of helplines asking to take control of your computer to fix a printer problem Keep anti-virus software up to date, to stop pop-ups from bogus services \n\"I would urge people to be particularly vigilant about this scam,\" said Lord Harris, chair of National Trading Standards. \n\"If you are seeking help for printer issues you should always use the official printer helpline details provided when you bought the product or consult the official website of the manufacturer for helpline details.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:14:57.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
