An idle chat. \n\"There's gonna be an accident here,\" his mate said. \nThe conversation is eerie now, as a black hole gapes in the side of the DFO building at Essendon and five people are dead . \nRobert works at Berkowitz Furniture inside the complex and was moments away from work when the plane crashed. \n\"This airport's smack in the middle of suburbia. Planes are going to come down always. We've all been saying that. We say it in jest, but now it's happened,\" he said. \n\"It's not something you think, 'Oh gee, it should have never happened'. It happens. If you're gonna put a shopping centre next to a runway this is what happens.\" \nThe crash has him rethinking the safety of his workplace. \n\"Our biggest problem here is one way in, one way out. The entry and exit points here are actually pathetic, so we're very lucky. \n\"Half an hour later and the general public would have been in here, so it could have been a whole different ball game. And if it was a weekend, that's 10,000 cars blocked up first thing in the morning.\" \nHe says staff have been through an evacuation drill for a potential terrorist attack, but not for a plane coming down. \n\"Which is weird because we've got an entire two runways that run opposite our stores,\" he said. \n\"Literally customers can stand and watch planes come in. It's a spectacle. So they'll have to get their act together here.\" Locals concerned about airport buffer zone \nSo who approved the DFO in that location? \nThe Howard government allowed the privatisation of Australian airports, including Essendon, by providing them very long-term leases. \nSince then the airport has proceeded to put a series of commercial, non-aviation enterprises on the land including the DFO. \nBecause the airport is on Commonwealth land, it does not require local or state planning approval. \nIt has always been the view of locals that Essendon's buffer zone is not big enough and compares poorly with the buffer zones for other airports around the country. \nThey say the airport is built on a 300 hectare site when it should more properly be 1,200 hectares. \nIn 1978 a family was incinerated when a light plane crashed into their house in Airport West â€” a gas heater in their house ignited fuel from the aircraft's ruptured wing tank. \nIn 1986 five died when an air ambulance plummeted into a paddock. \nSeven years later in 1993, a plane crashed into houses without killing anyone in what was dubbed the \"Miracle on Gilbertson Street\". \nAll of these accidents have happened within the 1,200-hectare zone that residents argue should buffer the airport.

(Metropolitan Fire Brigade) Plane crash a 'tragic mess' \n\"It's tragic mess,\" said resident Helen van den Berg, who used to organise a group of residents called the Close Essendon Airport Campaign. \nEventually she closed the protest group down, because no-one was listening. \n\"We were ignored by everyone. CASA, ministers. Any voice from the community is ignored.\" \nSome of the strongest pushback against relocating it comes in the form of the argument that it's an essential location for police and emergency services, crucially close to city hospitals. \nBut emergency flights are just a fraction of the aviation activity at Essendon which is mostly general light planes and charter aircraft. \n\"You see a tragedy like this and think of the decades and decades of people who've tried to highlight the safety concerns,\" says resident Helen van den Berg. \n\"It could have killed people at DFO, it could have hit the freeway. That's why the buffer zone should be there.\" \n\"For 25 years there have been community-minded people here raising concerns about the operation of an airport that has no protection zone. \n\"Why, if you've got something there for the common good, like an airport, why do you at the same time put other people in danger? It's inconsistent.\" Commercial development too close to runways, advocate says \nMarcus Diamond from the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) says his members previously raised concerns about commercial shopping developments being built on airport land at Essendon \nThe DFO shopping centre, which the plane crashed into, is on land owned by Essendon airport. It was built in 2005. \n\"If this was a grass field as it used to be, it could be a different situation,\" Mr Diamond said. \nWhile stressing the cause of the crash was still unknown, he says inappropriate developments at airports across Australia were increasingly hindering access to runways. \nHe says many light plane crashes occur close to the runway, so it is important that the area is clear. \n\"It's an increasing problem at airports around Australia. We've put in multiple submissions to government on this,\" he said. \nDFO has been contacted by the ABC about its emergency response plan. \nEssendon Airport chief executive Chris Cowan says counselling will be available for any DFO staff and the airport's emergency plan covered all contingencies \"from minor to full scale emergencies including on airport and off airport responses\".
