Stanley Wood, five, was on holiday with his parents Helen and Ben as well as his seven year old sister when the accident happened. The youngster was travelling down an escalator when his foot got stuck in the side of the escalator and his foot became mangled.

Unfortunately, medics were unable to save part of the youngster's toe. He also lost his entire plantar ligament which connects the big toe with the calf. According to the Gulf News , Stanley was rushed to Al Zahra Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery. Dr Mohan Rangaswamy, a plastic surgeon said the severed toe was so badly mangled it could not be reattached. Instead, he covered some of the exposed bone with a skin graft taken from Stanley's thigh. Dr Rangaswamy said: 'The big toe has two bones with a joint. The piece that went off included the nail and the tendon that was at the bottom and top surface for flexing and extension. 'The entire tendon got pulled out right up to the calf muscle as the force of the machine was so strong. We needed to cover the open wound with a flap. The patient was left with a bone sticking out and a large wound, it was trauma situation and this was an avulsion wound where most of the tissues were injured at different levels.' Stanley underwent emergency surgery at the Al Zahra Hospital in Dubai, pictured Dr Mohan Rangaswamy, pictured, performed emergency surgery on Stanley Wood Stanley will have to undergo at least three different operations as he recovers from his injuries.
