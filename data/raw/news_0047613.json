The concept of national security is going through fundamental changes. Climate change has become a new element of national security,\" the prime minister said. \nIn her speech, the Bangladesh Premier spoke about three key impacts of climate change - food security, water security and climate-induced migration. \n\"We need to develop climate change resilient cropping systems, which are tolerant to flooding, drought and salinity,\" she said about food security. \nSpeaking about water security, she reiterated her call to global leaders for creating a global fund of water. \nAbout climate-induced migration, she said, \"Millions are forced to move, internally and internationally, because of climate change. This has direct bearings on social and economic resources, resulting in new security concerns. \n\"The 2016 Global Risk report suggests that forced migration and climate change are the biggest risks for the global economy,\" she said. \nShe also spoke about Bangladesh's efforts to tackle these effects of climate change. \n\"Bangladesh is making every possible attempt to achieve low carbon development path. With our own resources, we established 400-million- dollar ‘Climate Change Trust Fund’ in 2009.” \n“Our success in disaster management is followed and replicated by many countries,\" she said. \nShe said Bangladesh had undertaken coastal greenbelt projects along nearly 900 kilometres of the coastline. \n\"Around 4.5 million solar home systems have been installed across the country. By 2018, Bangladesh will emerge as the largest solar nation globally,\" she said. \nShe regretted that the outcome of Marrakech Conference was not 'much encouraging'. \n\"The spirit generated in Paris can’t be lost,\" she said. \nAccording to her, climate change causes security concerns, by adding pressure on resources. \n\"It may also result in instability, violence and conflicts. In all cases, national security could be jeopardised,\" she said. \nCalling the world leaders for action, she said, \"Climate change is a global issue, and its solution should also be a global one. It requires combined, concerted and coherent actions.” \n\"Non-compliance by one state could threaten the survival of all. We must, therefore, share responsibility for ensuring security,\" she added. \nDeutsche Welle Chief Political Correspondent Melinda Crane-Röhrs moderated the discussion. \nAmong the panellists were Finland President Sauli Niinistö, Sweden Foreign Minister Margot Wallström, US Senator and Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Sheldon Whitehous, and former Ireland President and Honorary President of Oxfam Mary Robinson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T23:34:36.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
