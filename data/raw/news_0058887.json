Under President Barack Obama, expedited deportations were limited to people who had arrived within the previous two weeks, and remained within 100 miles of the border. The new policy applies that authority nationwide, and to any immigrant in the United States for up to two years. \nBoth policies come at a time of apprehension for the roughly 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally, including an estimated 250,000 in Maryland. Rumors of raids in Baltimore and Montgomery County in recent weeks have sparked fear in those communities, but have been applauded by GOP lawmakers, who say the Obama administration was too lenient.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:46:18.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
