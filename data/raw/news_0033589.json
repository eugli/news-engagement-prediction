On the same day CEO Elon Musk launched online ordering for the Model S and Model X vehicles in Dubai, shares for the electric carmaker rose 4% in trading Monday. This breaks through Tesla’s all-time closing high in July 2015, going from $280.02 to $280.60. Overall, Tesla’s shares are up 31.5% year-to-date.
