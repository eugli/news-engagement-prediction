Now, everything seems dull. It feels as if a part of me is missing. \n\"Mum, I'm sorry for everything. Sorry for not being a filial son; sorry for not being able to repay you, sorry for not being able to tell you I love you for the last time. You will be missed.\" \nA Facebook friend, who wished to remain anonymous, said Lee was a pious person and would visit Buppharam Buddhist Temple in Jalan Perak daily. \n\"I got to know her here at this temple. She would be here every morning to offer alms to the monks at the monastery. It's an act of virtue. Not many can do it,\" he said of Lee, a former student of Convent Light Street. \nPictures of Lee's car, with the side window riddled with bullet holes, went viral in cyberspace within the hour she was slain on Tuesday. \nRead Also: Shooting of woman in Penang not linked to triads: Police \nThe pictures shocked Lee's childhood friend Sharon Loh. \n\"We ex-Convent girls have a phone chat group and when the pictures were shared, all of us were stunned. \n\"I went to Standard One with Lee. She was beautiful even then, friendly and cheery. \n\"We are all going to celebrate our 50th birthday together on July 8. Lee had paid her share. It will be so sad she will not be with us,\" said Loh. \nLee's zumba partner Chan Lilian also saw the pictures and cannot believe she died a victim of such a violent crime. \n\"We used to talk about cooking and raising children. She spoke excellent English and was intelligent,\" said Chan. \nAt Lee's wake in Batu Gantung funeral parlour yesterday, sadness filled the air as family members gathered in front of the coffin to pay their last respects. \nPresent at the wake were Lee's husband Siak Kum Guan, 51, and son, who declined to be named. \nTheir daughter, who is studying overseas, is said to be flying home soon. \nEarlier at the Penang Hospital mortuary, family and friends wore face masks to avoid being photographed. \nSiak arrived at the mortuary in a metallic dark grey Mercedes Benz and looked distraught. \nThe family claimed the body at 3.20pm. The funeral will be held at 2pm on Saturday. Sign up for our e-newsletter now! Get all the latest news, lifestyle and trending stories, delivered to your inbox!
