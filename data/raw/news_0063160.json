(Photo: Brian Spurlock, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWith Purdue 23-5 and leading the Big Ten, sophomore Caleb Swanigan has jumped to the top of USA TODAY Sports' Wooden Watch thanks to consistently ferocious play. \nSwanigan is a double-double machine, averaging 18.6 points and 12.9 rebounds a game for the Boilermakers, a projected No. 4 seed in the NCAA tournament. While other player of the year candidates have legit sidekicks, Swanigan has been coach Matt Painter's rock to an overwhelming degree. \nHere's this week's list: 1. Caleb Swanigan, Purdue \nThe 6-9 sophomore big man has been a relentless wrecking force for the Boilermakers, playing with a high motor and scoring at will in the paint. He shoots 54% from the floor and is essentially automatic when deep in the post with an angle. 2. Frank Mason III, Kansas \nAs freshman Josh Jackson blossoms, Mason III continues to anchor the Jayhawks. The veteran guard has been an elite catalyst all season. His numbers (20.3 ppg, 5.0 apg, 4.1 rpg) are certainly impressive, but it's his leadership and clutch playmaking that helped him stay atop our rankings, while coinciding with Kansas' latest streak of close wins. 3. Josh Hart, Villanova \nThe heart and soul of the defending national champs, Hart has spearheaded the Wildcats' offense this season to help them stay out front in the Big East standings and currently hold a projected No. 1 seed in the NCAAs. He's averaging 18.7 points and 6.4 rebounds a game. \nMORE COLLEGE BASKETBALL NEWS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:12:06.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
