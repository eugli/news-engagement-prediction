Residents from Kemuning Permai and Kemuning Bayu are forced to shut their doors and windows due to smog which they say comes from a nearby light industrial area. \nPhilip Shigeo Brown said a neighbouring kindergarten in Kemuning Permai was also forced to keep the children inside, depriving them of much-needed exercise. \nHe said there were days when his living room was full of smog and he was worried for everyone’s health. \n“The risks may not be obvious now but there might be a long- term effect,” he stressed. \nShah Alam Technology Park owner Chong Chin Liong said the smog could be the result of faulty machinery or filters. \n“The smell has been around in the past but it was not so obvious. \n“It is very strong at the food court in the light industrial area where we are based,” he added. \nResidents in Kemuning Bayu, however, are still unsure about the source of the smell. \nA resident who wished to be known as Ho said the smell was unusual and did not resemble burning wood or other materials usually found at illegal dumpsites. \n“It smells more like chemicals burning. \n“Our guards said the smell was stronger between 2am and 3am,” he added. \nFed up with their living conditions, residents of both Kemuning Permai and Kemuning Bayu lodged separate complaints with the Selangor Department of Environment (DOE), the Shah Alam City Council (MBSA) and the police. \nThe DOE even paid the suspected site a visit but left after checks revealed there was no air pollution. \nHowever, residents claim the officers should have conducted a spot check between sunset and sunrise. \nAhmad Nazmi said DOE had refused to come down to check, forcing them to call the Fire and Rescue department who had readily checked on the complaint in the middle of the night. \n“We are disappointed with the DOE and MBSA. \n“The Fire and Rescue department have been really helpful but this matter is under the jurisdiction of the DOE. Only they can help us,” he added. \nHowever, MBSA said it has tried to help and have asked for relevant documents from the factory and is presently waiting for the documents to be submitted. \nMBSA’s corporate communications head Shahrin Ahmad said they have sought the assistance of the Klang District Office to locate the landowner of the said factory. \n“Our investigations revealed that the land was rented out to the current tenants. \n“We will need the information to act under the Town and Country Planning Act 1976,” he said. \nShahrin also said they will work together with relevant agencies to resolve the problem as soon as possible. \nLetters have also been submitted to the Selangor state government, including the Mentri Besar’s office and state environment committee chairman Elizabeth Wong. \nEfforts to reach a representative from the company were futile.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:10:51.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
