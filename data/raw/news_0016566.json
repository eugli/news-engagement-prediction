Even so, Windows 7 still accounts for 40 percent of the desktop operating system market share. Neither Intel or Microsoft support Windows 7 with drivers for Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors, but AMD is set to throw Windows 7 users a lifeline with its forthcoming Ryzen chips.\nThe announcement of Windows 7 support for Ryzen processors was made during an information session held by AMD and reported by German-language website Computerbase (translated).\nRyzen processors use the Zen microarchitecture , the AM4 socket, and are expected to launch in March this year. The 14nm chips support DDR4 memory and will offer between 2 and 8 cores for the consumer market and up to 32 cores for servers. The first Ryzen processor expected to appear in March is an 8-core, 16-thread performance desktop chip with a clock speed of at least 3.4GHz. It does not include an integrated GPU.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:08:37.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
