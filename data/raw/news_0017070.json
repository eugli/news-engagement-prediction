(FILE PHOTO) \nA Buddhist monk has been arrested in Myanmar after authorities found more than 4 million methamphetamine pills in his car and in his monastery. \nPolice officer Maung Maung Yin said the monk was stopped on Sunday (NZT0 as he drove in northern Rakhine state, which borders Bangladesh. \nAuthorities had been tipped off that the monk was carrying an illegal haul. \nMaung Maung Yin said an anti-drug task force found 400,000 pills in the monk's car. \nREAD MORE: * Largest ever Auckland Airport seizure of methamphetamine \nA subsequent search of his monastery turned up 4.2 million pills along with a grenade and ammunition. \nA statement from the office of Myanmar's leader, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, said that one million kyats (NZD$1000) in cash was also found in the vehicle. \nMyanmar is a major producer of methamphetamine, usually smuggled from the northeast to neighbouring countries. \nIt is also the world's second biggest producer of opium, from which heroin is derived. \n\"This is not a normal case, and when we were informed that the monk was arrested, we were all shocked,\" said Kyaw Mya Win, a township police officer. Ad Feedback \nAsked about the case, the director general of the Religious Affairs Ministry, Soe Min Tun, acknowledged some surprise. \n\"It is not a very common case, but not impossible... he will have to give up his monkhood right away and face trial as an ordinary person,'' he said. \nPolice said they were still questioning the monk on Tuesday. \nLast year, Myanmar officials seized 21 million methamphetamine pills with a street value around US$35.5 million near the border with China in the biggest such seizure in recent memory. - AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:11:52.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
