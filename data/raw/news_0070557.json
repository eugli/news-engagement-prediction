And he did her,\" said Janet Hendry, Heath's grandmother. \nHer daughter, Tamara, was a kindergarten teacher and single mom who died of a heart attack last year. But Heath pressed on and showed a pig at the Hardee County Fair. \nWhat happened was astounding: His pig sold for $170 a pound, bringing a total of $47,000 that night, along with donations that followed. \n\"People gave $5 and $10. We were blessed to write him a check of over $75,000 for his pig last year,\" said Terry Atchley, president of the Hardee County Fair.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:33:03.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
