(Photo by Ryan Lim) Industry leaders upbeat on future effects Some insights from industry leaders and experts during \"Indian Budget 2017 - Managing the Future\", organised by Khaleej Times and its partners - the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (Abu Dhabi Chapter) and the Indian Business and Professional Group - at the Abu Dhabi Global Market late on Saturday. Dr B.R. Shetty, Executive vice-chairman and CEO, NMC Healthcare After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit, we are all elated. The UAE leadership's respect for Indians has only increased after the visit. I am forever for India. I will go back to my country and invest in sectors like healthcare, education and infrastructure. I came to the UAE looking for a job and I am proud to say that I am comfortably well off. So, it's time for me to give back to my country. So far I did not have the confidence. But now our prime minister and his party will be there for the long term. I have my healthcare and money exchange businesses spread all over the world. Now I will be foraying in to India. I am happy to announce I will be building a government hospital in Karnataka free of cost for women and children. And to sustain it, I am setting up another 400-bed hospital, which's revenue will be pumped in to the free hospital. It's the first time in Karnataka government. Kidney transplantation is another philanthropist project I am undertaking in India. I have got the go-ahead from the Karanataka government to provide kidney dialysis in all government hospitals in the state. Adeeb Ahamed, Managing director, LuLu Financial Group It's more an inward-looking budget rather than an outward one. To a large extent, it hasn't made a lot of international and multinational companies happy about the way things have happened. The government and the finance minister have always wanted to take care at what's happening in the country. This was a budget that looked at making our house stronger rather than addressing international issues. The government is looking to bring foreign direct investment into multi-brand retailing. The government is slowly strategising on this move. They find it early to become an open policy. This move will help the Indian economy in the larger picture. What's lacking in India in the retail side is creating cold store warehouses, infrastructure and so on. With multinational firms coming inside such issues will be addressed. The government has realised that the only way to remain in power is by satisfying the needs of the people. It's a beautiful thing and invoked the right spirit among people. Now every state government is fighting among themselves to be the most preferred for investment. This right spirit of competitiveness has helped India showcase itself as an investor-friendly nation. Homi Phiroze Ranina, Indian Supreme Court advocate India is at a crossroads and is going to emerge as one of the great powers of the world. In the backdrop of a very difficult global situation, Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has done a superb job. India is considered a bright spot in bleak global economic scenario. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's \"Make in India\" campaign is a game-changer; India was considered to be the black sheep among foreign investors. Now foreign direct investment has come up and inflation rates are down. Demonetisation is a game-changer for several reasons. India has money but it doesn't get translated into revenue for the government because of one huge problem that India had for last 60 years - parallel economy. Black money hasn't allowed the country to grow. Demonetisation has helped bring money into the system. India, he said, has more billionaires inside the country than outside. Also, by 2020, India will be the second-largest economy in the world after China in terms of purchasing power parity. The government has a \"new way of thinking\". The government is taking steps that will make resident and non-resident proudly call themselves Indians. Modi has made ease of doing business his main mantra. Jimit Devani, Director, Deloitte, Haskins & Sells Everybody was aware that India is largely a tax non-compliant society but for the first time the Indian finance minister spelt it out by announcing it with the figures in the parliament. We do not know how the global economy will look at it but he gave that as a rationale for going forward for demonetisation. Only 20 million Indians - that is, hardly 1.5 per cent of our population - pay taxes. That is no way a government will survive for long. If we look at others, for example Brics, is better at seven to eight per cent of its population pay tax. Our tax-to-GDP ratio is 16 per cent. The third rationale he gives is the imbalance between the indirect and direct taxes. So when people who are paying taxes are not enough, where is the money going? There is a parallel economy and that is why demonetisation had to be introduced. The real benefits of demonetisation will come in next year. When they gave tax numbers and the impact of GDP on the revenues, they have not budgeted or taken into account the tax they are going to collect from the deposits that have been made into bank accounts. So whatever tax the government is going to collect will widen the tax base. Shazia Ilmi, politician, former TV host and moderator of the event Demonetisation was a huge disruptive measure. This practice has been there in other countries but to not with any great results. There was lot of talk and speculation (in India) but not a single riot or mishap happened. The middle class India and the poor took it in stride but lot of people faced inconvenience. I don't know how this gamble will pay off. It was done with the best intention but implementation has left few things to be desired. \"Political funding remains a huge issue. I left my job as anchor to join the Anna Hazare movement. I stand for that - cleaning up the economy and country, for us to be proud of ourselves that we are not cheats or liars. When demonetisation news came, political funding was at the heart of the matter. For first time, this issue is being addressed. This government has done a huge breakaway from the earlier kind of rhetoric that was associated with the BJP. I recently met (BJP president) Amit Shah and he said 'earlier the conversations were about Hindus, Muslims and riots, and now they are about rich and poor'. This is a huge accomplishment as instead of addressing the real issues we often get snared by other things. Rajiv Shah, Chairman, Institute of Chartered Accountants of India Abu Dhabi Chapter The budget presented by the finance minister is a very growth and development focused budget with a lot of emphasis on rural infrastructure and employment generation. I think it's the step in the right direction to create a new India. Sapan Aggarwal, Communication leader, ICAI The government is giving a lot of push to agricultural and rural development that will boost the economy. At the same time, the budget also has enough to attract investment and propel infrastructure growth. It is a well-balanced budget. Ramesh Krishnan, Member, ICAI The main takeaway from this budget is that it covers all areas of national development. It is growth-oriented with many long-term benefits. And more importantly, the public fears of increased taxation after demonetisation have been put to rest by the government. Tarun Khandelwal, Managing director, Advisory Partners Overall it is a positive budget. Government has taken steps to ensure all sections of the economy benefits. But devil is in the detail. I do not personally think demonetisation has done any good to the economy. So I would like to wait and see the long terms effects of the budget. Bhavin Khalpada, Founder and CEO, Akshar Consultancy It is a good budget that will definitely boost FDI and also increase tax collection. By taking steps towards a transparent economy, the government has improved investors' confidence. NRIs have begun to feel India is a safe haven to invest. Dr Ram Buxani, Chairman, ITL Group It is very positive and growth-oriented. The fact that the finance minister admitted in parliament that Indians are tax non-complaint is in itself a bold step. It took our country 64 years to admit it. So I think it is a new beginning. Imtiyaz Ahmad Ansari, Executive director of group treasury, National Bank of Abu Dhabi The budget was presented in the thick of the demonetisation and all the implementation fault lines we saw. But with widening the tax base, the government has ensured more revenues, which in turn will result in better social and infrastructure development. Devanand Mahadeva, Director, Goodwins Legal Consultants This budget is a clear indication that the government is offsetting some of the implementation problems of demonetisation. The farmers, traders and the salaried class who were the most affected stand to benefit, and that is a class act by the government. Mukul Gangal, Business development manager, Al Jaber Energy Services I will call it a progressive budget. I rate it nine out of 10. Government has taken strong steps to curb illegal money and limit election funding. My opinion is cash transactions should be further limited to Rs50,000 and election funding from a single source should not be higher than Rs100. Suresh Panwar, Vice-p resident, Union National Bank It is definitely growth-oriented - rural development and employment generation being the main highlights. Making more people tax compliant will be a game changer and that is the biggest takeaway from the Jaitley budget.
