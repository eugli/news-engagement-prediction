What I have got to do to be the best me? The outcome will always naturally happen. \n\"Don't worry about the title. Worry about what you've got to do today, tomorrow, the next day and that title will be waiting for you. \n\"The fight is one under the dark lights and you go under the lights to shine, so I am looking forward to getting back in there.\" \nKlitschko has denied playing mind games in the build up to the fight, but it will be interesting to see how the Ukrainian – who hasn’t stepped into the ring since his controversial defeat to Tyson Fury in November 2015 – responds to this latest dig. \nAll the build up so far has been rather respectable between the two boxers, something that doesn't usually happen before big fights. \nHowever, as the date pulls ever closer, expect the trash talking to heat up, especially with Joshua claiming his rival doesn't like the mind games. \nLet the games begin! \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
