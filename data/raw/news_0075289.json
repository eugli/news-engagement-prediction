(Photo courtesy of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association) \nMore than 30 prominent Christian leaders in the Vancouver area, including the Vancouver Catholic archbishop and evangelical leaders, issued a public letter Friday expressing concerns about evangelist Franklin Graham ahead of a rally he plans to hold there next weekend. \nIn the letter, the leaders decried Graham’s “contentious and confrontational political and social rhetoric.” More than 25,000 people are expected to attend Graham’s evangelistic “festival” March 3 to 5 in Vancouver, British Columbia. \nGraham, who has been controversial even among evangelicals in recent years, read from the Bible at President Trump’s inauguration. Though he never officially endorsed Trump, he was seen as a key ally who declared after the president’s win that “God’s hand intervened” in the election. He is the son of famed evangelist Billy Graham and president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan’s Purse. \nGraham’s rallies are similar to the evangelistic “crusades” his 98-year-old father would hold. Billy Graham, who met Trump at his 95th birthday party in 2013, served as a pastor to several presidents. The elderly evangelist was also famous for his ecumenism, or emphasis on unity among churches, drawing criticism from fundamentalist Christians. \nBut the letter published Friday seemed to suggest a fracturing of Christian unity in Vancouver over the younger evangelist’s plans. \n“[Graham] has made disparaging and uncharitable remarks about Muslims and the LGBTQ+ community, while portraying the election, administration and policies of U.S. President Donald Trump as intrinsically aligned with the Christian church,” the letter says . “Such blending of politics and religion is dangerous.” \nThe letter was signed by Vancouver Catholic Archbishop Michael Miller, Vancouver-area Anglican Bishop Melissa Skelton and Ken Shigematsu, pastor at Vancouver’s Tenth Church, a popular megachurch for evangelicals. Shigematsu has cited Graham’s uncle Leighton Ford as his mentor. [ How Donald Trump is bringing Billy Graham’s complicated family back into White House circles ] \nThe move comes after Vancouver’s mayor and other city officials earlier this week asked festival organizers to drop Graham. \nThe mayor is concerned about the “extraordinarily derogative” comments the pastor has made, especially after an attack on a Quebec City mosque, Councillor Tim Stevenson said, according to the Globe and Mail . \n“Why would they have invited this person in the first place, knowing that he’s said these things about Muslims, knowing that he’s said these things about the LGBTQ community?” said Stevenson, who was the first openly gay person ordained in a Christian denomination in Canada. \nThe Vancouver Sun called the letter from Christian leaders “unprecedented,” and the festival has already divided Christian leaders in the city. \nAccording to the group, they sent Graham the letter earlier this week, and he responded saying he would avoid controversial topics, but he “neither retracted nor sufficiently addressed the harmful statements to which we drew his attention.” \nThe Christian leaders cited three specific comments from Graham: All Muslims should be banned from the United States because Islam is a “very evil and wicked religion” at war with the Christian West. LGBTQ+ persons should not be allowed to enter churches or even enter as guests into Christian homes, because “the Enemy [Satan] wants to devour our homes.” The outcome of the recent U.S. presidential election was due to “the hand of God,” giving the impression that the Christian church as an institution is partisanly aligned with an administration and its policies. \n“Such blending of politics and religion is dangerous. First, it comes close to aligning the power of the church with the power of the state,” the letter states. “Second, it does so by seeming to develop a false religious narrative to support an exalted and troubling American nationalism. Third, it can divide Christians who do not view things the same way as Mr. Graham. Fourth, we are concerned that some of the policies of the Trump administration have introduced unprecedented structural shifts that put the most vulnerable in our world at risk of greater harm. These policies may jeopardize refugees and reinforce prejudice.” \nGraham could not be reached for comment on Friday. \nGraham’s Facebook page, which has 5 million fans, has become a regular source of controversy. Earlier this month, he compared “fake news” to Jesus and the Pharisees . He also called Planned Parenthood “a Hitleristic organization.” Graham said he planned to preach to Puerto Ricans using an immigration analogy and comparing it to heaven.
