Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA man has claimed he contracted skin cancer after stubbing his toe, a much-debated area of medicine over whether trauma can cause the deadly disease \nRoland Monger received the shock skin cancer diagnosis after going to his GP when his toe began to turn black. \nMedics diagnosed him with skin cancer, and found a tumour the size of a grapefruit in his groin area and initially said he may just have a year to live. \nHowever Mr Monger has now made a recovery. \nHe says he was told the trauma - caused by hitting his toe on a step after he broke his ankle - may have caused his cancer. \nThis theory of a 'trauma' to a limb causing the deadly disease is much debated in medicine. \nThe British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) disagree that the blow would have caused skin cancer. They claim there needs to be an 'insult' such as overexposure to sunlight for this occur. \nDr Walayat Hussain, of the BAD, said some people often see a blow as an 'insult' but this can in fact be the trigger that causes people to get checked out in the first place.

It was black and bloody and was giving me a few problems so I got it checked out.\" Read More \nDoctors told him that the cancer was aggressive and that he might only have a year to live, the Exeter and Express Echo reports. \nFurther tests and scans followed. \nDoctors found a tumour \"the size of a grapefruit\" hidden in Mr Monger's groin area. \nHe added: \"We did a few tests and there was no mole, but I was told that while 80% of skin cancer cases come from sun exposure, another 20% comes from traumas, like hitting a limb really hard. \n\"That causes the cancer to spread.\" \nMr Monger said the first thing that went through his head when he received the diagnosis was how he was going to tell his family. \n\"It was a pretty horrible feeling. I was shell-shocked,\" Roland said. \n\"I'm going have to make a video for my son,\" I thought, like in the Hollywood films.\" \nLuckily the tumour was found on March 25, 2016.

Up at Derriford for 10 minutes every morning.\" Dermatologist Dr Walayat Hussain (Photo: BBC) \nDr Walayat Hussain, who has studied the theory that skin cancer can be linked to traumas, said: \"No dermatologist will ever tell you that banging the toe has caused the skin cancer. \nDr Hussain told the Mirror he could not prove a definite link after his research. But he said there were a range of theories that exist including that trauma could be a contributing factor. \nOne theory can also be that a trauma - such as accidentally hitting a limb or stubbing a toe - can be a fortunate event that triggers a person to seek medical help and then discover unrelated cancer. \nDr Hussain said skin cancer generally needed a so-called \"insult\" - such as over exposure to sun light - and the theory advanced by some was that the trauma was this trigger. \nTrauma-related cases were generally on the big toe and thumb because they were bigger and tended to suffer more knocks, he said. \nMr Monger says his recovery has given him a new lease of life and he now works for the admissions team at Plymouth University. \nAdditionally, he always had a vested interest in music â€“ as seen through his blog 'Listen With Monger ' and wanted to take action to give something back. \nHe came up with the idea of the 'One Day Festival' to raise money for the hospital that cared for him and St Luke's Hospice. It will be held on March 25, 2017, exactly a year after he was diagnosed. \nSome of Devon's most notable acts, such as Joanna Cooke, Jamie Yost, Nick Gladdish, Phat Bollard and the Busketeers will be performing at the festival and entry will be free of charge.
