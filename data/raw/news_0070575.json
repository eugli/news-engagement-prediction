The offending T-shirt has been withdrawn from Primark stores over claims it is racist \nPrimark removed the shirts from its shops following a complaint from Methodist minister Ian Lucraft, who wrote to the company's chief executive. \nHe told the Sheffield Star : \"We were shocked when we came face to face with a new T-shirt with a racially explicit graphic and text. \n\"It was fantastically offensive and I can only assume that no-one in the process of ordering it knew what they were doing or were aware of its subliminal messages. \n\"The slogan is “Eeeny meenie miny moe.” It stops there, but of course we all know what the original said: “catch a n****r by his toe.\" \nHe added: \"The graphic has a large American baseball bat, wrapped round with barbed wire, and covered with blood. This image relates directly to the practice of assaulting black people in America. \n\"It is directly threatening of a racist assault, and if I were black and were faced by a wearer I would know just where I stood.\" \nIn the Walking Dead scene, the word 'tiger' is used instead of the N-word.
