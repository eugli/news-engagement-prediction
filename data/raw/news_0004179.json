NBA Australia \nPublished on Jan. 31, 2017 \nJan. 31, 2017 \nIf the Detroit Pistons forgot who is the King in the Fourth in the NBA, Isaiah Thomas served them a resounding reminder today. \nMORE: Heat extend winning streak to eight games after beating Nets \nThe little guy, who entered the game leading the league in fourth-quarter scoring (10.3 points per fourth quarter) and the East in overall scoring (29.1 points per game), surpassed both of his unbelievable averages – with ease – during today's 113-109 win over the visiting Pistons. \nThomas racked up an incredible 24 points during the fourth quarter alone to take his total to 41 on the night, and the Celtics needed every single one of them. \nDetroit scored 39 points during the fourth quarter after scoring no more than 25 during any of the first three quarters of the game. In order to keep pace and maintain a lead, the C’s needed Thomas to deliver, and he did exactly that. \nThomas’ fourth quarter featured six made field goals, three made 3-pointers and nine made free throws. Every time the Pistons made a big shot, such as their eight points in s span of just 59 seconds midway through the fourth to take a 96-93 lead, Thomas was there to answer. \nAll in all, Thomas scored 22 of Boston’s final 25 points of the game to hold off Detroit’s comeback bid.
