They ranked them based on community feedback — users could tag questions \"very difficult,\" for example — and offered up a list of the 20 questions that they thought were the toughest. \nDavid Whitby, UK Country Manager at Glassdoor, says: \"Preparing for an interview thoroughly means being ready for anything, even a curve ball question not directly related to the job. Remember, it’s not necessarily about getting the right answer, more how you cope under pressure.\" \nHere are the 20 toughest questions: 20. \"Tell me about your childhood\" — Learning and Development Employee, Next REUTERS/Andrew Yates \nHigh Street fashion retailer Next is the company that asked this difficult question . The question was posed to someone applying for the position of \"learning and development employee\" — presumably a HR role that involves staff training. The question may be trying to gauge the candidate's empathy skills, which can be important in training, or their own experiences with learning and training. 19. \"Provide an estimate for the number of goals in the premier league.\" - Management Accountant, VAX Martin Rickett / PA Wire / PA Images \nVax may be humble vacuum cleaning manufacturers but they're clearly looking for talented thinkers. The company asked this question of a potential management accountant but these types of questions are often asked in management consultancy interviews. The idea is to see how logically candidates think and watch them tackle a problem in real-time. 18. \"Are you a nice guy?\" — Product Manager, Badoo REUTES/Peter Nicholls \nTech companies often like to think of themselves as a little bit different and dating app Badoo is clearly no different. Asking a would-be product manager if they're a \"nice guy\" will keep candidates on their toes — is the right answer to say yes or do you need to be a little cut throat to get by at the company? 17. \"What is your coping mechanism when you have a bad day?\" - Consultant, Switch Consulting Shutterstock \nA question like this can help an interview judge the resilience of a candidate, something that's particularly important in high-pressure jobs. Switch Consulting is a specialist retail recruiter and asked this question to a candidate who wanted to join as a consultant. 16. \"What does social justice mean to you?\" - Content Marketing Manager, ThoughtWorks A protester at a Black Lives Matter march in London. John Heggestuen/Business Insider \nSocial justice has become a huge topic over the last few years, with the New York Daily News going so far as to hiring civil rights activist Shaun King as a social justice writer for the paper. ThoughtWorks is a technology consultancy but is clearly looking for a plugged-in writer to take the position of content marketing manager to produce content that will resonate with people. One way to test this is to probe their knowledge of topical issues, such as social justice. 15. \"You have 50 red and 50 blue objects. Split these however you like between two containers to give the minimum/maximum probability of drawing one of the colours\" - Operations Analyst, Clearwater Analytics Reuters \nClearwater Analytics provides software to insurers and asset managers to help them with risk management, compliance, and reporting. The question they asked of a would-be operations analyst shows they are looking for someone with a good grasp of mathematics and a logical mind. The ideal candidate would have to think through the problem and work out the probability. 14. \"What would you ask the CEO if you met him one day?\" — Performance Analyst, British Airways Rebius / Shutterstock.com \nCompanies want to know that candidates have done their homework on the business and demonstrate real commitment to what they do. One way to do that is to ask them what they would ask the CEO and see how they answer: are they aware what the big issues facing the company are at the moment? This may be what British Airways was trying to get at with this question posed to a performance analyst candidate. 13. “What’s your the biggest regret managing people so far?” - Area Director, Regus \nRegus, which provides temporary office space, is likely testing a number of attributes with this question for area director applicants : honesty, self-reflection, analytical skills, and of course, management skills. 12. \"Who is your hero, and why?\" - Product Quality Employee, GE DC Comics \nAsking a person to name their hero can tell you a lot about their personality, their priorities, and how they look at the world. It can help GE, which does everything from financial services to fridges, to tell if they've got the right person to fill a product quality job. 11. “There are three people, each with different salaries, and they want to find the average of them without telling any of the other two their salary. How do they do it?\" - Technical Delivery Graduate, BAE Systems Applied Intelligence \nBAE Systems Applied Intelligence specialises in tech-led defence and aerospace and they are clearly after an analytical, logical thinker with strong maths skills to join its graduate programme in technical delivery. 10. \"How would you describe cloud computing to a 7-year-old?\" - Graduate Scheme, Microsoft REUTERS/Bobby Yip \nCommunication is important in all organisations and a question like this, posed by Microsoft to a graduate , tests the ability to break things down to simple parts and convey what they are. The question also tests just the candidates understanding of computers and their ability to think logically. 9. \"How do you cope with repetition?\" - Product Specialist, Tesla Motors Tesla CEO Elon Musk. AP Photo/Jack Plunkett \nElectrica car maker Tesla likes to see itself as a groundbreaking company but building a car can be a cumbersome and repetitive process as parts must be tested over and over again to make sure they are safe and function correctly. It's a good idea to see how a product specialist with cope with this in advance . 8. “Describe your biggest weakness. Then describe another.” - Forward Deployed Software Engineer, Palantir Technologies \nAnalytics company Palantir Technologies is notoriously one of Silicon Valley's most secretive companies. The CIA-backed startup one-ups the usual interview question of asking for a candidate's biggest weakness by asking for two , forcing people to think on their feet. 7. \"If your best friend was here what advice would he give you?\" - CCP, American Express White House/Pete Souza \nLike many of the other questions on the list, this one forces applicants to reflect on how they come across to others around them. It's important to be aware of how people view you if you're working as a customer care professional, the role American Express was recruiting for here. 6. \"You are stranded on the moon with a group of other astronauts and you need to travel 200 miles back to base, here is a list of 15 items salvaged from the wreckage of the spacecraft you were travelling in. List them in order of importance.\" - Sales Employee, Turnstone Sales Apollo 17 commander Gene Cernan stands next to a flag and a rover on the moon.. NASA \nSales staff have to be able to convince and cajole and this question gives candidates the perfect opportunity to demonstrate their powers of persuasion by justifying their choice of order. Unfortunately, the candidate didn't provide the list of the 15 items to Glassdoor. 5. \"What's the most selfish thing you've ever done?\" - Graduate Consultant, PageGroup Selfish? AP Photo/Petros Giannakouris \nRecruiter PageGroup might be looking for honesty from graduates with this question but the person who was asked doesn't say. The candidate says the whole process took 4 months and advises \"keep on your toes the whole process.\" 4. “If you had a friend who was great for a job and an identical person who was just as good, but your friend earned you £2,000 less, who would you give the job to?” - Associate Recruitment Consultant, Hays plc Reuters/Stefan Wermuth \nRecruiter Hays pose a practical problem to potential employees with this question to see how they would cope with a real life recruitment problem. The interviewee told Glassdoor: \"I would choose my friend as he I knew for a fact he would turn up for the work on day one and wouldn't let me down. (I should have said, go with the person who makes you more money). Sticking to my answer worked in my favour.\" 3. “How would your enemy describe you?” - Advertising Sales Grad Scheme, Condé Nast www.thederniercri.net \nConde Naste is the publisher of Vogue, the fashion magazine that inspired the film and book, the Devil Wears Prada. It's not clear in the Glassdoor review whether the advertising sales grad scheme was company-wide or for a specific title but if you're familiar with Meryl Streep's character in Devil Wears Prada, it's not hard to imagine her asking this. 2. \"What am I thinking right now?\" - Regional Director, TES Global Shutterstock \nTES — or the Times Education Supplement — Global is a digital education publisher. It's not exactly clear what they were driving at by asking what the interviewer was thinking but the candidate who went for the regional director role wrote on Glassdoor that they found the whole thing \"very bizarre.\" 1. \"What on your CV is the closest thing to a lie?\" - Marketing and Communications Employee, The Phoenix Partnership Dima Korotayev / Getty \nThe Phoenix Partnership makes software for the healthcare sector. With this question, the company may well be testing how far sales staff are willing to push their software without overpromising or exaggerating. However, the candidate who posted the question wrote on Glassdoor: \"Say absolutely nothing is remotely close to a lie. They are trying to catch you out and if gave them anything I'm pretty sure they would string you up for it.\" This story was originally published by Glassdoor.
