His parents moved to Canada from Morocco and have been here 25 years.\nHe said he couldn't explain why he was the only one of the group of 20 students to be turned back, since he has travelled to the United States many times before without incident.\n\"All the other times, be it for races or training camps or family vacations, we were not stopped and passed right through like any other Canadian citizens,\" he said.\nThe kinesiology student said university staff is helping him find a solution he hopes will allow him to travel in the future.\nIn the meantime, he's considering attending a race in Ottawa next weekend instead.\nAber's incident comes after a woman from the Montreal area said she and a cousin were denied entry to the United States last Saturday.\nFadwa Alaoui, a Moroccan-born Muslim who has lived in Canada for 20 years, said the questions she was asked focused almost exclusively on her religion, although authorities also wanted to know what she thought about U.S. President Donald Trump.\nOn Friday, an NDP MP urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to raise Aber's case with Trump when the two leaders have their first meeting on Monday.\n\"Our prime minister needs to speak with Donald Trump when they meet next week and say that a Canadian, born in Canada, who happens to be of another faith, a Muslim faith, does not need a visa to go to the United States,\" Murray Rankin told reporters in Ottawa.\n\"There's not a rule for Muslims and a rule for other Canadians. It's shocking, and we need the government to start taking action.\"\nRelated Stories South Shore Muslim woman denied at U.S. border for day trip to Burlington", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:39:03.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
