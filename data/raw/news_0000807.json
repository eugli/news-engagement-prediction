Daily Mail Cameron is alleged to have pressured the Daily Mail's owner to sack Paul Dacre over the paper’s staunch Brexit stance \nIt is understood Dacre resisted this pressure, saying he would not temper his editorial position. Dacre had been largely Eurosceptic for many years. \nBy March, it is said Dacre had been told by a well-placed source of Cameron’s moves against him with Rothermere. \nThe revelation is said to have left Dacre “incandescent” with rage. The Mail’s line on Brexit continued to harden during the campaign. Iain Crockart/DMGT/PA Archive A source told the BBC’s Emily Maitlis that Lord Rothermere was urged to reign in his editor over Brexit \nA spokesman for Rothermere, who supported the UK remaining in the EU, refused to confirm or deny whether Cameron had asked for Dacre to be dismissed. \nHe said: “Over the years, Lord Rothermere has been leant on by more than one prime minister to remove Associated Newspapers’ editors but, as he told Lord Justice Leveson on oath, he does not interfere with the editorial policies of his papers.” \nDacre declined to comment on whether Cameron had sought his dismissal. \nIn a statement he said: “For 25 years, I have been given the freedom to edit the Mail on behalf of its readers without interference from Jonathan Rothermere or his father. It has been a great joy and privilege.” \nA spokesman for Cameron said: “It is wrong to suggest that David Cameron believed he could determine who edits the Daily Mail. \n“It is a matter of public record that he made the case that it was wrong for newspapers to argue that we give up our membership of the EU. \n“He made this argument privately to the editor of the Daily Mail, Paul Dacre, and its proprietor, Lord Rothermere.” MORE BREXIT", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T14:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:15:37.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
