She broke her left arm and wrist and couldn't get free. Fairfax \nJudith Permar broke her left arm and wrist and couldn't get free from the bin, similar to the one pictured here. \nInvestigators believe she went to the drop box at about 2am Sunday. \nShe was found dead more than six hours later with her feet suspended above the ground, investigators said. \n\"She was fishing bags out and the ladder she was standing on gave way and she couldn't get her hand loose,\" said Mount Carmel Police Chief Brian Hollenbush. \nHollenbush, who knew Permar, described her as a very nice woman. \n\"It wasn't something that I would expect to be seeing,\" he said. \nBags with clothes and shoes that had been pulled from the bin were on the ground. Permar's black Hummer was nearby with the engine still running, Hollenbush said. \nPermar leaves behind her husband, three sons, one daughter and four grandchildren.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T13:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:23:19.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
