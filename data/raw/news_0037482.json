It appears that one of (L-R) Usman Khawaja or Matt Renshaw will make way for Shaun Marsh.

Selectors are keen to play ‘subcontinent specialist’ Shaun Marsh in India.

Aussies need to cool Kohli 0:54 \nWith Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon and Steve O’Keefe all virtually assured first Test selection, the only position up for grabs now may be the No. 6 all-rounder battle between Mitchell Marsh and Glenn Maxwell. \nIt’s understood Marsh is favoured, but Maxwell could come into contention if the wicket in Pune looks like a raging turner that would suit slow bowling. \nAustralia XI for tour match: David Warner, Matt Renshaw, Steve Smith (capt), Shaun Marsh, Peter Handscomb, Mitchell Marsh, Matt Wade, Glenn Maxwell, Steve O’Keefe, Nathan Lyon, Jackson Bird \nAustralia likely XI for first Test: David Warner, Matt Renshaw, Steve Smith (capt), Shaun Marsh, Peter Handscomb, Mitchell Marsh, Matt Wade, Mitchell Starc, Steve O’Keefe, Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
