John Cleese was first in the hot seat back in 1991 and since then, a procession of big names from the world of comedy and entertainment including Jennifer Saunders, Jarvis Cocker and Eddie Izzard have helped continue the chain. Joe Lycett is a stand-up comedian who some know as \"the parking fine man\" from 8 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown while others celebrate him for any number of acclaimed live tours and festival shows that have delighted the British comedy viewing public in recent years. Joe's chosen guest is Katherine Ryan, the Canadian stand-up star and presenter who is perhaps best known for her live stand-up work - 'Glam Role Model' and 'Kathbum' - as well as appearances on BBC2's Episodes and Taskmaster on Dave. Katherine fields questions on subjects as varied as being compared to Joan Rivers and the secret of happiness, all via a mini-detour to address her hatred of bread.
