What are your rights at the U.S. border? \nThe children looked back from where they had come as the U.S. officer held the first man, saying his papers needed to be verified. The man turned to a pile of belongings and heaved pieces of luggage two at a time into the gully â€” enormous wheeled suitcases, plastic shopping bags, a black backpack. \n\"Nobody cares about us,\" he told journalists.

The Canadian Press says an RCMP officer at the scene told their photographer that they were carrying passports from Somalia. However, a Reuters photo showed that at least one of their passports was Sudanese. \nAn earlier Reuters report said the man claimed they were all from Sudan, and had been living and working in Delaware for two years. \nThe man then appeared to grab their passports from the U.S. officer before making a run for the border. \nThe officer yelled and gave chase but stopped at the border marker. Canadian police took hold of the man's arm as he crossed. RCMP officers helped the children as they climbed through the snow to cross the border into Quebec.
