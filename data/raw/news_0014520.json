A photo posted by Samantha Armytage (@sam_armytage) on Feb 3, 2017 at 3:30pm PST \nArmytage encouraged the potential tossers to “think about it” and cleared up any confusion that the post might not be coming from the host herself. \n“Written, spoken & authorised by Samantha Armytage,” she wrote. \nHer father Mac Armytage has been a Rural Fire Service volunteer for 43 years and has previously received a medal for his service. \nThe Daily Advertiser reported the fire burnt through more than ten acres of state forest and came close to property loss. \n40-year old Armytage, who grew up on a sheep property in the Snowy Mountains, has always been proud of her country heritage. \nHer newest Instagram post is just another example of the Sunrise host’s compassion for taking care of the country.
