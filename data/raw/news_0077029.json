But his decision to boycott the ceremony seems to have propelled the voters to honour him in a clear statement against Mr. Trump’s immigration policy. \n“These wars prevent human right and democracy in countries which themselves have been victims of aggression. We need empathy more than ever,” the speech concluded. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:27:47.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
