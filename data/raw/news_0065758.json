However, 50 year old Suresh Chandi and his 47 year old wife Sugana decided to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary in a unique way. The couple surprised family members and friends by celebrating their silver jubilee at a cemetery . They invited over 1800 people for the celebration, where delicious Gujarati food was also served. What's more, the two went the whole hog and even set up a mandap inside the cemetery. The main gate of the crematorium was decorated with flowers and lighting like a party venue. While the celebration was going on, a family arrived there to perform last rites of a relative. To offer respect to the dead body, the guests stood up and offered condolences. The music programme was stopped until the family finished last rites. Interestingly, the Chandis were blessed with a baby after 23 years of marriage. Suresh Chandi, who is a social worker, also has an ambulance which helps poor families and small kids of Viramgam in reaching hospitals in Ahmedabad. He does not even charge for the service and sustains this service only through donations. Most people fear going to a cemetery even in the daytime, but this couple was happy to break the taboo.
