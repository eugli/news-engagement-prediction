Unlike the series 900 Yoga laptops, the new Yoga 720 isn’t designed to be a premium Windows laptop. At a $859.99 starting price, the 13-inch Yoga 720 does all the things you expect a Yoga to, thanks to the classic 360-degree hinge. You can flip the laptop into a tablet mode, a tent mode for watching movies, or just a regular laptop mode.\nLenovo is refreshing this range of Yoga 720 laptops with Intel’s latest 7th generation Core i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of HDD storage or 512GB of SSD. It’s also adding in Windows Hello support thanks to a new fingerprint reader on both the 13- and 15-inch models. It’s quick to simply swipe and access Windows 10 without a password, but it’s not as convenient as an infrared camera to let you scan your face instead. Lenovo appears to be keeping that kind of Windows Hello feature for its more premium laptops, until the components are smaller and cheaper to push down the product line.\nGrid View Both the 13- and 15-inch models have the same 4K display, which obviously affects battery life. Lenovo is claiming up to 7 hours on the 4K display for the 13-inch, and up to 8 hours on the 15-inch. You can also opt for regular full HD displays, and you’ll gain an extra hour of battery life by doing so. Both devices also include support for Lenovo’s active stylus, so you can take advantage of the new Windows Ink features in Windows 10.\nYou can get an Nvidia GTX 1050 on the 15-inch model One big difference with the 15-inch model over the smaller variant is the ability to pick an Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics card as an option. That means the bigger Yoga 720 is capable of gaming for basic titles, but you won’t get the “VR Ready” promise that comes with the GTX 1060 or above. Still, it’s a good choice to have over Intel’s HD graphics on the 13-inch model.\nI got a chance to briefly try out both models and I was pleasantly surprised by the build quality and the new iron grey color scheme. These look and feel like premium Yoga laptops, even if they’re not at the very top end. They both have prevision trackpads, and the quality keyboard you’ve come to expect from Lenovo.\nLenovo is planning to introduce the both models in April, with the 13-inch starting at $859.99, and the 15-inch priced starting at $1,099.99.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:02:53.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
