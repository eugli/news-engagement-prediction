As Cerner Corp. grows its data footprint, it also bolsters its defenses. The North Kansas City-based health IT company manages about 200 petabytes of data — about 100 times the combined data of all U.S. academic research libraries. Of course, all of this data has to be stored somewhere secure. Cerner operates three data centers throughout the U.S., each with large server rooms. Two are in the Kansas City area, encapsulated within thick concrete walls and numerous security checkpoints. The interior of one of Cerner's data centers, which house 200 petabytes of data from its… more Cerner Corp. A cabled fence capable of stopping a 15,000-pound truck surrounds the perimeter. Cars and employees must enter one at a time, allowing the company to keep a close watch on who comes and goes. Chief Information Officer Bill Graff described the server room itself as a \"building in a building,\" with 16 to 24 inches of concrete protecting it from tornadoes and other natural disasters. \"Hopefully, it can withstand any sort of tornado that may pop up over the hill here,\" he added. Within this concrete shell, a team of Cerner's most tenured associates runs its 24/7 immediate response center. Next to posters for the Kansas City Royals, a host of monitors lets them track Cerner's global network infrastructure. Their desks face the sole set of windows — bulletproof glass — within the secured area. There are also cots in the building, in the event of increased activity due to a pandemic. Across the hallway, a large space hums with the activity of numerous servers that host Cerner's most important asset. Each server is connected to at least two power systems, which are housed in separate rooms in the event of a fire. Cerner also has eight backup generators, which switch on after a power failure, consuming more than 150 gallons of fuel per hour. Because Cerner's systems receive and transmit crucial patient information, all of this happens seamlessly, so the system is never down. Brian Smith , director of critical facilities for Cerner, said the worst outage in a decade resulted in three seconds of downtime. In the absolute worst-case scenario, a backup of all patient data is stored at another Cerner data center. Although the amount of data Cerner manages has increased rapidly, the physical footprint has been limited, as new storage systems become more compact. To put it in numbers, the servers Cerner uses are eight times smaller than the ones the company installed in 2000, but they consume 17 times as much power. \"Almost 10 years ago, this room was half-full,\" Smith said, gesturing to the servers. \"We've grown six times in this building.\" Cerner still has plenty of room set aside for future growth. The company has room to build an identical data center at its headquarters, as well as its Lee's Summit campus. Although the building itself is impermeable to most tangible dangers, Cerner also hires a team to protect against hacks, as health information has become a significant target in the past few years. A cyber defense team constantly monitors traffic in and out of Cerner's data centers. \"It's a never-ending job,\" Graff said. \"Unfortunately, there are more bad guys than good guys in this space.\" Elise reports on health care, life sciences and publicly traded technology companies.
