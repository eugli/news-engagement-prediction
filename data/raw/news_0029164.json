Photo: Getty Images \n\"People know where he stands on Islam, it's not something created in one day or visit. His position is well known by everybody, it's clear in the media, he was an activist as a student â€¦ he's an educator.\" \nWhen pressed by Metro TV anchor Najwa Shihab on whether he shared the FPI's belief that Jakarta's governor must be a Muslin, Mr Baswedan replied: \"When we talk about verse from the Koran, it's clear, it is stated there. As a Muslim, I abide by al-Ma'ida 51 .\" \nIt is verse 51 from the fifth sura or chapter of the Koran that has landed Mr Purnama in so much hot water . It is interpreted by some as prohibiting Muslims from living under the leadership of non-Muslims. \nOthers say the scripture should be understood in its context - a time of war - and not interpreted literally. \nIslamist hardliners have consistently used the verse to urge Jakartans not to vote for Ahok, who is Christian. \nMr Baswedan and Mr Yudhoyono both attended a \"mass prayer\" at Istiqlal Mosque, an event some dubbed the \"112 [February 11] march\", which police eventually allowed on the condition people stay within the mosque and that it not feature any political speech. \nThis was ignored: religious leaders told the crowd of about 100,000 people to vote for Muslim leaders and participants brandished placards that said things like \"It is forbidden to pick an infidel leader\". \nMr Baswedan told the BBC he had simply conducted morning prayers and stressed that he had not exploited religious sentiment during the election campaign. \n\"I never talked about religion, never talked about any sura, not even once. Other people used it and made all of this happen,\" Mr Baswedan said. \nBut Indikator pollster Mr Burhanuddin is among those who believe Mr Baswedan has damaged his moderate reputation. \n\"The only way of beating Ahok is to use religious sentiment because 75 per cent of Jakartans perceive Ahok has done a good job,\" Mr Burhanuddin said, adding that the strategy had worked for Mr Baswedan up until now. \n\"For Anies this is really a big game. If he fails to win the election, it is all just finished for him - his reputation as a pluralistic, inclusive Muslim figure is just finished. He is just like other politicians - using everything to win the election even at the cost of his reputation.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T07:16:16.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
