What started off as a journey with a handful of characters has since spanned 14 films, with no signs of slowing. Phase Three is in the process of introducing a ton of new and exciting settings into the mix, as well as more diverse heroes. In addition to being more inclusive of people of color through movies like Black Panther and Spider-Man: Homecoming , the MCU will also finally feature female characters in leading roles through Captain Marvel and Ant-Man and the Wasp . The former will be played by Academy Award winner Brie Larson, and she recently revealed her favorite characteristics of the hero. \nBrie Larson recently sat down with the folks at IGN regarding her role in Kong: Skull Island . When asked about her upcoming role as Carol Danvers in Captain Marvel, she revealed an aspect of the character she fell in love with during her research process, saying: \nJust the fact that she can be a bridge between two worlds, that she can go to Earth and go to space and that her own personal place is in this little area between where Earth ends and space begins -- that that's only hers -- is so moving to me. I'm just inspired. I've been so inspired, like going through all the comics and reading them right now that's been like, what I'm doing on the side, and I'm just amazed. \nAnd reasons like this are why casting Brie Larson was the perfect choice for Captain Marvel. Despite the actress being a few years younger than the character, Larson clearly has an ability to connect and empathize with her characters, even if they happened to be superpowered badass ladies. \nCarol Danvers' Captain Marvel is one of the most powerful figures in Marvel lore, and certainly within the confines of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A decorated Air Force officer, Captain Marvel has powers that very closely resemble DC's Superman. She's got super strength, flight, near invulnerability, and the ability to shoot blasts from her hands. But she can also survive in space, allowing her to fly above Earth- her private sanctuary that no other characters can explore. \nAlthough the Marvel Cinematic Universe deals with out of this world concepts, the most effective stories are firmly rooted in the human experience. While Captain America: Civil War featured the insane airport battle and tons of heroes, the heart of the film was focused on moral ambiguity, the loss of Tony's parents, and Cap's loyalty to his best friend. And while Brie Larson might not be familiar with flying around and wearing tights, she can understand the appeal of finding one's sanctuary and private space in life. And that's what going to make or break bringing a lesser known character like Captain Marvel to the big screen. \nYou can catch Brie Larson in Kong: Skull Island beginning March 10, 2017.
