Image caption Hamilton (right) spent a month in Brittany pretending to be a Frenchman to avoid detection Image caption Anne Ropers hid Hamilton and two other agents for about a month \nIn an interview before she died last year Mrs Ropers, then 97, said: \"They stayed in my parents' room. At night, Guy was in one bed and the sailors in the other. \n\"By day, all three of them spent their time lying on their beds, so that they did not make any noise.\" \nMr Sibril said: \"Had the Germans discovered Guy Hamilton and his fellow sailors, this would have been extremely dangerous. Not only for them, but also for the whole network of Resistance fighters.\" \nMarguerite Pierre, 92, was another Resistance member who helped Lt Hamilton. \nShe said: \"We were told by our commander that we risked either deportation or being shot in the field. We knew what the risks were.\" Image caption Hamilton managed to send a message back to his naval crew in Dartmouth telling them he was safe \nOne night Hamilton's cover was almost blown, when members of the Resistance took him for a boozy game of boules. \nHe said: \"They took me down the road to a cafe that had a bowling alley in the back. \n\"Well that was alright except that it was full of Germans all in uniform, having a drink. And the lads said 'can we have the bowling alley after you Fritz?', and they said 'yes, yes'â€¦ I was appalled and horrified.\" \nMrs Ropers said: \"Each team bought the other a jug of cider. The Germans bought a jug of cider for the Englishman and vice versa.\" Image copyright Hulton Archive Image caption Sir Roger Moore said Hamilton \"was very much a James Bond character himself\" \nHamilton would recall these experiences while directing James Bond films, as 007 actor Sir Roger Moore recalls. \nHe said: \"He did tell me that he was once dropped into Nazi-occupied France and, being separated from his squad, found himself in a fairly sticky situation in a French village teeming with German soldiers. \n\"By virtue of speaking fluent French he was able to pull the wool over the Germans' eyes in a bar by pretending to be a local, and he was obviously very convincing.\" \nFor nearly a month Hamilton managed to avoid detection before escaping back to safety in England. Ten days later the escape route used by the Resistance was uncovered by the Nazis.
