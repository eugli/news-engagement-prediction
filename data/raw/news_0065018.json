Radhakrishnan, principal secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, made the submissions on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition moved by P.A. Joseph, an AIADMK cadre, seeking a probe into the “mysterious” death of Jayalalithaa. \nHe wanted the court to appoint a committee comprising retired Supreme Court judges to probe her death. \nWhen the plea came up for hearing on Thursday, Apollo Hospitals, another respondent to the PIL, submitted that all the information released by the hospital pertaining to the treatment of former chief minister Jayalalithaa was done as per her wishes. \n“She had expressed her desire that no photographs be released, and that any information released about her medical treatment emphasise the positive aspects such as potential recovery and discharge from the hospital,” S.M. Mohan Kumar, legal manager, Apollo Hospitals, said. \nHe asserted that all the information released by the hospital was done only on the request of the State government in the interest of maintaining public order and minimising speculation and rumour mongering. \nAs to the complete details of the treatment provided to Jayalalithaa, Mr. Mohan Kumar said, “With reference to the provision of the (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, the MCI Code of Ethics, and Joint Commission International, an independent international accreditation agency for hospitals worldwide, the hospital is bound to maintain the privacy preferences of each patient.” \nClaiming that the petitioner has based most of his contentions on hearsay and not on facts, Dr. Radhakrishnan also said that the medical practitioners, as part of their duty, are not bound to reveal details related to patients. \nRecording the submissions, the First Bench of Acting Chief Justice Huluvadi G. Ramesh and Justice R. Mahadevan adjourned the PIL to March 13 for the Central government to file its submissions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:59:53.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
