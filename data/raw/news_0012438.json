GETTY Kezia Dugdale is expected to defy Corbyn's demands to back the Government demands \nShe added the symbolic debate in Edinburgh was a “chance for our national parliament to reaffirm the voice of the people of Scotland” and show that Scots “oppose the catastrophic hard Brexit now being pursued by the Tories at Westminster”, according to the Telegraph. \nKezia Dugdale, Scottish Labour’s leader in Holyrood, announced her MSPs are expected to defy Corbyn’s demand to vote in favour of triggering Article 50. The defiance by Dugdale is just the latest in a series of Labour rifts. \nDespite the anticipated puerile show of defiance from Scottish Remoaners, the House of Commons voted 489 to 114 to allow the Government to begin formal Brexit negotiations.
