It continues to describe details about the 44th president, such as \"last seen walking out of a large white house\" and \"likes basketball and health care.\" \nThe posters have not only flooded American neighborhoods throughout the nation - and even across the world - they have also gone viral throughout social media. The posters have been tagged in Instagram posts in cities in California, New York City and even Stockholm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T06:06:18.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
