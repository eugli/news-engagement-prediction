(Photo: Getty Images) More Two years ago, Jimmy Kimmel told the world how he lost a bunch of weight on a fasting diet . He still must be a little hangry, because he found a way to keep making references to weight, dieting, and Spanx while hosting the Oscars on Sunday night. It began while he was ribbing his faux enemy Matt Damon: “I’ve known Matt so long that when I first met Matt, I was the fat one,” he said. He also used it to poke fun at Hollywood’s hypocrisy on a night when surely celebrities would be making political statements. “We don’t discriminate [against] people based on what country they come from,” he said. “We discriminate on people based on their age and weight.” Kimmel’s comments on Andrew Garfield’s losing 40 pounds for Silence garnered criticism from astute viewers. “It was an astonishing physical transformation that hasn’t been attempted since every actress in every role ever,” he said. Immediately, Twitter users reminded us that Tina Fey and Amy Poehler already did that joke when they hosted the Golden Globes in 2014. jimmy kimmel, showcasing how women don't get credit for their own work, stole that weight loss joke from Tina & Amy when they hosted. \n— Abbi Matheson (@AbbiMatheson) February 27, 2017 Then the host recycled a bit by Ellen DeGeneres, who had pizzas delivered to the audience. In a much more dramatic fashion, favorite movie snacks Red Vines and Junior Mints fell from the sky.

Not everyone was amused with this line of humor. \"Time to find out if those spanx really work!\" REALLY JIMMY KIMMEL?! #OscarsSoMale @Timipoeppelman Don’t forget, though, that Kimmel himself was once the butt of his own Spanx humor. I wore three pairs of Spanx to get into that tuxedo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:31:56.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
