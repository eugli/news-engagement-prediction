Sheriff (@VolusiaSheriff) February 22, 2017 Feb. 23 (UPI) -- A Florida sheriff's office shared a photo of a deputy whose \"hurry to get back to the job\" led him to drive off with a gas pump nozzle hanging from his car.\nThe Volusia County Sheriff's Office tweeted a photo of the patrol car driving with the nozzle hanging from the side of the vehicle. \n\"When you're just in a hurry to get back on the job,\" the sheriff's office tweeted.\nAndrew Gant, assistant public information officer for the sheriff's office, said the pump had a quick-release mechanism that allowed the nozzle to come free without damaging the equipment.\n\"No gas pumps were harmed in the making of this photo,\" the sheriff's office explained in a Facebook post .\nGant said the deputy had been filling up his gas tank when it started to rain. The deputy decided to wait inside the vehicle and then forgot to return the nozzle to the pump before driving away.\nThe deputy realized his mistake when he was flagged down by another driver, who snapped the photo, Gant said.\nGant said the undamaged nozzle was reattached to the pump.\n  Pop-Tarts pop-up in Times Square features sugar-packed pizza, tacos College student's care package filled with trash he neglected at home Florida college student grades ex-girlfriend's apology letter, gives it a D-", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:15:52.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
