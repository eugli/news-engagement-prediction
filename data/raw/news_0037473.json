Expand / Contract \nThis is a political sign for Trump, with a not-so-subtle protest affixed to it. The sign probably represents the tension in your Facebook news feeds, and in your own communities. \nThis sign also represent the tension in my own home. Because this sign is sitting in my garage. \nThe Story Behind the Sign \nIt was the week before the election. My husband, a life-long Republican and an Iowa farmer, brought his Trump sign home. The folks at the county GOP office hoped he might put it up in the yard. To my husband, the sign represented the promise of a better America. He wanted to plant that sign out front, but he knew what I would say before he even asked: \n“Um… NO.” \nThere we stood in the kitchen. It was a standoff between a husband who would vote for Trump — and the wife who wouldn’t. \nThe sign didn’t go in the yard. Scott set it against the wall in the garage. A day later, our 12-year-old daughter Anna quietly went outside and affixed a Post-It note to the sign with a single word: \n“No…” \nThis is the state of things in our house right now. This is the very real tension that we are living in, day after day. Expand / Contract \nIn a weird way, the tension in my home is a gift. It’s a hard and painful gift, but I choose to call it a gift anyway. Because it is teaching us something very important about what it means to find unity in the midst of a sharp divide. \nWhich is why my husband and I invited you into our home today. \nWe want you to know that if you are experiencing deep tension, you are neither alone nor powerless. We invite you — not for a fight, but in the name of unity. Scott and I are learning how to navigate this, and we hope what we’ve learned helps you, wherever you are, however you voted, whomever you support. \nChances are, you are dealing with tension too. This post is for anyone who can’t see eye-to-eye with the people they love dearly, yet don’t have the option of unfriending their spouse, best friend, sister-in-law, or their own kid. These are your people. And you just want to figure out how to live in peace with them. \nFirst of all, our divisions should not shock us. Neither Scott nor I is shocked by what’s happening in our own home. When we married, we knew we didn’t see eye to eye on everything. We jokingly referred to ourselves as Carville and Matalin , a political couple famously known for their opposing views. \nBut we got married. Here’s why: \nBecause we loved “us,” more than we hated what was different. \nThat conviction brought Scott and I to the altar, and it’s what keeps us together all these years later. Maybe that’s a starting place for each of us today: \nWe can love “us,” more than we hate what is different. \nStatistically speaking, we are collectively “different.” If you had to pick sides, half of you would be standing next my husband, and half of you would be standing near me. \nBut it’s not that black-and-white, is it? This is way more nuanced than two “sides.” \nImagine three cardboard boxes. \nPeople are putting everyone into one of three boxes. \nThe first box is labeled: “heartless, bigoted conservative.” \nThe second box is labeled: “whiny, bleeding-heart liberal.” \nThe third box sits in the middle, a little higher than the other two, and it is labeled: “I’m right.” \nThe funny thing is, everybody thinks he himself is sitting in the “I’m right” box, and anyone who is “other” is assigned to one of the other two boxes. \nHere’s where Scott and I began long ago, back when we decided to “love us, more than to hate what was different.” We looked at the stupid boxes. And then we threw them all away. \nStep One: Throw Away the Stupid Boxes \nPutting people in boxes is easy. We do it because we’re lazy and stubborn. We don’t have to think as much when we have boxes. We get terribly frustrated when we can’t find a box to put someone in. It’s easier to label someone, than to do the harder, nuanced work of trying to see that someone else might have a point. \nHarder still is this: \nTo believe that your deepest convictions and “their” deepest convictions are both born out of a deep love for God and/or humankind. \nBecause I live with someone who thinks differently than I do, it would be tempting to put him in a box. But I don’t get to put Scott in a box. \nWhy? Because I live with him. I see who he really is. \nEvery morning, I find my husband wide awake in his recliner, reading the Bible. \nEvery night, I see him kneeling at the side of the bed, praying with our daughters. \nI watch how he is generous with his finances — giving to causes that might surprise the most left-leaning liberal. \nI watch how he spends hundreds of hours every year devoted to prison ministry. \nAnd I have observed his dedication as school board president for our public school. \nI don’t fit in a box either. Statistically speaking, I migh t have fit in the Trump box: I am a white evangelical Christian woman and a registered Republican. But I didn’t vote for Trump, and I have never once voted straight-ticket. \nSince I didn’t vote Trump, some of you might have put me in a “Hillary Clinton box.” But I don’t belong there, either. I am pro-Life, and because of that, I am also pro-refugee . I voted for a third-party candidate named Evan McMullin. \nThere’s always more than what we first choose to see. \nHumans are too complicated for stupid boxes. \nStep Two: Resist the Urge to Be Right \nScott is not a simple man, but he has a simple approach to dealing with conflict. Every day at lunch, we talk about politics, the Supreme Court, the latest with the refugee crisis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the farm economy, and more. Which means, every single day, we are entering a potential minefield. Sometimes, there are tears. \nIf it gets hot in the kitchen, Scott steps out of the room. He doesn’t make a big scene. It’s his way of saying, “I’m not going to tell you how right I am, and I’m not to listen to you explain how right you are.” \nScott loves “us,” more than he hates what’s different. \nAlso? He loves “us,” more than he loves being right. \nStep Three: Before you speak, THINK. \nIn our home, we adopted this saying: \n“Before you speak, THINK.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:11:21.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
