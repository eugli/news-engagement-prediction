But for Kumeren Govender, a final-year medical student from the University of KwaZulu Natal, this is something that he has already mastered. \nAt the age of only 23 this young medical student and talented musician will soon publish a scientific paper he has written as a lead researcher, something which is regarded as a huge accolade and a rare phenomenon in the academic world for an undergraduate. \nHis research on clinical risk factors affecting HIV-positive patients in a hospital setting, is set to be published in the Pan African Medical Journal. Not only has he co-authored a further two articles previously that were published in the South African Journal of Infectious Disease and African Health Science, but he has worked with some of the country’s top scientists in the research institution Caprisa (Centre for Aids Programme of Research in SA). \nGiven his early success in medicine it is hard to believe that when he chose to study medicine in 2012 it was an 11th hour decision for this young man from Shallcross, Durban. “I decided to change my career path a month before I started engineering after weighing the options and particular motivation from my late gran.
