When you see it in the ground or in a miner's hand for the first time, you know you've seen it in some shape or form before. \nThat's because mica is used extensively in several industries making lots of different consumer products. \nAs the child held up a large flake of ruby mica it clicked – the glistening tone was familiar. I had seen it before in cosmetic products. India's illegal mines are run by cartels that make huge profits while workers earn a pittance.

The miners have no protection whatsoever. \nWe found children as young as six working at the mines. Child labour is prohibited under Indian law. Six-year-old Shamil Murmu breaks rocks to fill his bowl with the prized mineral.

But it exported 140,000 tonnes. Illegal production accounts for the huge discrepancy. \nThe illegal mines are run by cartels that make huge profits. By comparison, the mine workers earn a pittance and their work is extremely dangerous. Nine in 10 deaths in the dangerous mines go unreported.

Mica's glistening properties hold great appeal in the fashion-conscious West.

But mining it is anything but people-friendly. Young children accompany their mothers at the mines. Credit: ITV News/Sean Swan \nIndia produces most of the world's mica. More than 75% of India's mica production is illegal. \nAll of which means it's impossible for the cosmetics industry to guarantee that illegally produced mica is not contained in the make-up sold worldwide. It's hardly a pretty picture. One young child, not yet old enough to dig or break rocks, still knows the mine as home.
