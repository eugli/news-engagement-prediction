Last season, singer Ariana Grande said “Oh, s—“ after flubbing a song during her opening segments. The show typically edits out the profanity in time for a West Coast broadcast on NBC. \nIn the past, profanity on “Saturday Night Live” has not been rewarded. In February of 1981, cast member Charles Rocket improvised a response to host Charlene Tilton that included the word “f—,” an incident that went down in infamy. Featured player Jenny Slate inadvertently used a variation of that same word in her debut on the show in September of 2009. While she had a strong first year, and even established herself with a recurring character, she didn’t return to the program the following season. \nThe latest episode of “Saturday Night Live” was particularly raucous, with Alec Baldwin and Melissa McCarthy joining the cast to portray Trump and Spicer, respectively. The McCarthy sketch , in which she portrayed the White House spokesman as bordering on unhinged and spraying reporters with a super-soaker, was praised almost immediately on Twitter.
