Rec Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images If Tom Brady and the Patriots are going to find a way to win Super Bowl LI, they’ll have to defy history first. No team has won the Super Bowl after trailing by more than 10 points. Nearing halftime, New England finds itself down 21-0. So the odds are certainly not in the Patriots favor. When New England beat the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX, the Patriots were down 10 in the third quarter before scoring 14 in the final frame to notch the win — and even then it came down to final goal-line stand.
