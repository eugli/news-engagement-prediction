You gotta be in this for the long haul.\"\nEmanuel was speaking at the Stanford Graduate School of Business in California and tried to make the case that it's going to be a longer fight than some Democrats may believe.\nSome Democrats have pointed to the 2009 tea party movement as an example of a guide to follow now that they've lost all power in the federal government. That tea party movement led to Republicans taking back the House in 2010, the Senate in 2014 and helped usher President Trump into the White House.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

Emanuel said it will take longer for the same thing to happen for Democrats and they need to be ready for a long fight.\n\"Winning's everything,\" he said. \"If you don't win, you can't make the public policy. I say that because it is hard for people in our party to accept that principle. Sometimes, you've just got to win, OK?\"\n\"Our party likes to be right, even if they lose. I don't go to moral victory speeches. I can't stand them. I've never lost an election. It's about winning, because if you win you then have the power to go do what has to get done.\"\n\"If you lose, you can write the book about what happened — great, that's really exciting!\" he added.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Civil rights groups deliver 1 million anti-Sessions signatures to Senate \nThe Senate on Tuesday received 1 million petition signatures calling for senators to reject Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions' nomination to be attorney general.\n\"He decides whom to charge and perhaps not to charge, and which laws to enforce most vigorously, and perhaps which not. And that comes to my central complaint and my reason for opposing Senator Sessions,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., when delivering the signatures.\nBlumenthal sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which approved Sessions' nomination last week.\nThe petition signatures were collected by various civil rights groups such as the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and Voto Latino.\nBy Kelly Cohen • 02/07/17 5:03 PM Top Story Trump immigration ban showdown: How the lawsuit breaks down Federal appeals court will rule on executive order, which may then be taken up by Supreme Court.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 02/07/17 1:50 PM Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:12:55.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
