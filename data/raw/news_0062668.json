Credit Romain Etienne 10 French Landscapes to Play In Claire Bardainne, an artistic director of the French digital and live-art company Adrien M & Claire B, calls the company’s suite of installations “imaginary territory.” Titled “ XYZT : Abstract Landscapes ,” it features 10 interactive environments that will form the centerpiece of Teknopolis. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The company, last seen at the academy two years ago with “Hakanaï,” a dance piece performed in a digital cube, will invite visitors to touch, walk on, dance with and sometimes just stand back and ponder its works arrayed in the Fishman Space. “We don’t want to do images that remain inside a screen,” Ms. Bardainne said from France. “We want to turn images into environment. We want to turn them into living partners to play with, relating and reacting in a sensitive way to the body. That’s why we always try to do immersive and interactive artwork — so you forget that you are in front of images.” Photo Balam Soto’s “Exp.Inst.Rain.” Credit Balam Soto Instrument of Sound and Light The new-media artist Balam Soto , based in Connecticut, has a few artworks with titles that start with “Exp.Inst.” The first bit is an abbreviation for “experimental,” the second for “instrument.” But what is rain doing in the title of this one, “Exp.Inst.Rain”? “When I finished it, it was a rainy night,” Mr. Soto said cheerfully from Hartford. Made from Plexiglas, sensors, wood and other materials, “Exp.Inst.Rain” responds to touch with sound and colored light. A lover of electronic music, Mr. Soto wanted to create an instrument that would allow people to play it easily, whether or not they had any musical expertise. Technology, like visual art, used to be a more passive experience for the public, he said. Now that it is so hands-on, he added, “we have to make changes in the way the patrons can interact with the artwork.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.
