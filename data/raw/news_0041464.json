NEVER LOSE A MATCH \n“And in that meeting, there was a comment made by Kurt that I kind of just ended the meeting because Kurt made it very clear that being an Olympic gold medallist that he couldn’t possibly ever lose a match. \n“He’s the best there is and no one could ever beat him. No one would ever believe that he could lose a match. So, I thanked Kurt for his time and I wished him very well with his gold medal and move on.” \nHe went on to reveal that they would eventually come to terms after Jim Ross made contact. \nIn his debut, though, Angle was presented as a ‘real athlete’, and Prichard revealed that guys like Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Undertaker didn’t take too kindly to that. \nHe added: “I mean, Steve Austin for one, looking at him like, Well, godd**n, is this guy saying I ain’t real?’, so sure, everyone was, even The Undertaker felt it was demeaning and didn’t like the tone of the vignettes.” \nIt’s a good job they were able to move on from Angle’s comments, as he went on to carve an incredible career and create somebody the fans love. \nWhat do you make of Kurt Angle almost ruining his WWE career?
