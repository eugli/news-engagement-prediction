Editor Advertisement \nSo, 4,400 people have been found to have submitted false claims for SkillsFuture credits without actually taking any course. And the money cheated in the false claims amounted to about $2.2 million. \nAre people in Singapore so hard up over money? Are we not making enough money from honest hard work, that we have to resort to cheating and lying our way, to claim freebies handed out by the government? Of course, the freebies handed out by the government are an oxymoronic sentence. There are never freebies handed out. \nMaybe the government would do well to find out just why these people resorted to cheating. Maybe people would rather receive actual cash, then monetary credit that can be used to pay for a course that maybe people do not need. \nChoo M N \nA.S.S.
