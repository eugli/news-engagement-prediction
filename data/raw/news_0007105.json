We are moving forward with those proceedings today as a matter of fact. Hopefully we’ll have a favourable outcome.”\nHe said he was in court filing a motion on the matters this morning.\nIn a statement, the TTC says it will make sure the move does not impact transit service in the city.\n\"The affairs of the TTC’s largest local union (Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 113) and its international parent are unrelated to TTC management or decisions of TTC management,\" the statement reads. \"The TTC is working to ensure this matter has no impact on service. The collective agreements between the TTC and its unions remain in place.\"\n\"The TTC will offer no further comment on this internal union matter.\"\nPhotos An image of the offices of the ATU Local 113, which represents TTC workers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T18:44:35.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
