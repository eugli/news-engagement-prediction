Experts predict it will save thousands of lives every year. \nIt works by threading a tiny camera attached to a thin flexible tube into the lower part of the bowel. As well as detecting tumours, it helps spot small growths, called polyps, on the bowel wall. If left untreated polyps can become cancerous, and any found during a bowel scope can usually be removed immediately. \nBowel scope screening will not detect cancers higher up in the bowel and patients may need a colonoscopy if they have persistent symptoms. \nBut the research found the new test was able to prevent 35% of bowel cancers overall and 40% of deaths. \nIn the lower bowel, the test prevented more than half of potential cancers from developing in that area. \nResearchers from Imperial College London followed more than 170,000 people for 17 years on average, of whom more than 40,000 had the bowel scope test. \nThere are more than 41,000 new cases of bowel cancer every year in the UK, and about 16,000 deaths. \nProf Wendy Atkin, Cancer Research UK’s bowel screening expert and lead author at Imperial, said: “Although no screening test is perfect, this study shows that bowel scope is effective in reducing cancer deaths for at least 17 years. \n“Bowel cancer can be prevented. And the bowel scope screening test is a great way to reduce the number of people diagnosed with the disease so it’s vital that no one misses out on the opportunity to get the test.” \nJulie Sharp, Cancer Research UK’s head of health information, said: “Like other types of screening, bowel scope is meant for people without symptoms. It’s a great way to help reduce the number of people developing or dying from bowel cancer, but it can’t pick up everything. \n“So it’s still important to take part in the rest of the bowel screening programme and not ignore the home testing kits when they arrive.” \nThe government estimates the bowel scope test will take at least another three years before it will be offered to everyone eligible across England. This is in order to train specialist staff to carry out the tests. Governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not yet committed to introducing the test. \nThe research was funded by the Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health Research. About half of bowel cancers occur in the lower part of the bowel and the rectum – the area covered by the bowel scope test. \nThe health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said: “This report is really encouraging – prevention and early diagnosis are key to improving outcomes, and this new screening test could help us save thousands more lives. \n“Cancer survival is at its highest rate ever, but more must be done: we are investing £300 million a year by 2020 to increase diagnostic capacity for all cancers, so we can save more from this devastating disease.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:06:41.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
