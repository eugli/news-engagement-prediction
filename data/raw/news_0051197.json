From holding Bayern Munich to a draw with their second team in 2007 to knocking out their Spanish counterparts the following season. \nBut a week prior their encounter on the 21st February, Bolton entertained Atletico at the Reebok Stadium and earned an invaluable first-leg lead thanks to a goal from El-Hadji Diouf. (Everyone watches on as the ball nestles into the corner.) \nBut the tie was shifted following the referee brandishing Sergio Aguero with a red card for spitting. Then moments later, Diouf scored sending the home fans into ecstasy as his strike ultimately proved to be the winner. \nNot only did the Bolton faithfuls have Diouf to thank but also Jussi Jaaskelainen who produced heroics between the sticks in particular preventing Antonio Lopez with a brilliant stop. \nDespite the likes of Diego Forlan and Sergio Aguero - albeit a cameo - leading their line, the visitors failed to secure a crucial away goal ahead of the second leg. (Atletico's starting XI featuring Forlan, Reyes, Maxi, Luis Garcia to name but a few.) \nThe La Liga outfit were without the services of Aguero, though were nailed on to eventually progress granted they were trailing by the one goal. But the side fourth in the league failed to muster up any serious threat as they were dumped out by the Premier League side. \nAgainst the odds, the Trotters churned out a resilient defensive display to hold the Spanish side to a goalless draw, claiming a famous two-legged victory.
