MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported the deal is worth $2.6 million, plus incentives. \nThe Dodgers have not confirmed the signing, which would require a corresponding 40-man roster move. \nThe signing of Gutierrez, who bats right-handed, indicates some concern over other right-handed-hitting outfielders. Among them, Scott Van Slyke and Trayce Thompson are coming off injuries, as is left-handed-hitting Andre Ethier . \nGutierrez, who turns 34 later this month, was originally a Dodger farmhand and was sent to Cleveland in the Milton Bradley deal in 2004. His best offensive season was 2009 (18 home runs, 70 RBIs, .283 average), after being dealt to Seattle, and he won a Gold Glove there in 2010. \nIn 2016, he played 98 games with Seattle with a .246/.329/.452 slash line. He was tied for second in the American League with 12 home runs against left-handed pitchers. Ken Gurnick has covered the Dodgers since 1989, and for MLB.com since 2001.
