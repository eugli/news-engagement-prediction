As Ste drifts further and further from Harry, he confides in a shocked John Paul that he thinks they are over. \nDetermined to prove he can be romantic and eager to win John Paul’s heart back, Ste goes all out to recreate the moment that he proposed in a rowing boat and it seems that John Paul is both impressed and swayed by the gesture. (Picture: Lime Pictures) \nAs the couple reconnect, they decide that it’s time to come clean and Ste prepares to tell Harry the truth. \nBut with James Nightingale very much still on John Paul’s radar, is he as sure as Ste about giving things another try? \nAnd how many people are going to end up with their hearts broken? \nOne to watch: Monday 20th February on E4 at 7pm.
