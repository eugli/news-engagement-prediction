USA TODAY Sports Edwin Encarnacion is one of the baseball's most consistent power hitters. (Photo: Ken Blaze, USA TODAY Sports) 385   \nWith spring training workouts commencing in Florida and Arizona for most major league teams on Tuesday, USA TODAY Sports examines the top 10 players changing uniforms and their ability to impact the 2017 landscape. \nA look at the top 10: \nFormer team: Toronto Blue Jays \nNew team: Cleveland Indians \nBreakdown: The free agent slugger will slide nicely into the cleanup spot for the defending American League pennant winners. He's one of baseball's most consistent power hitters. Over the past five seasons, he slugged 193 home runs, second only to Chris Davis (197) and drove in 550 runs, second only to Miguel Cabrera (569). 2. LHP Chris Sale \nFormer team: Chicago White Sox \nNew team: Boston Red Sox \nBreakdown: In a blockbuster trade with the White Sox, the Red Sox landed one of the most dominant left-handed pitchers. Sale joins David Price and 2016 Cy Young Award winner Rick Porcello, giving Boston the best 1-2-3 starting combo in the majors. 3. RHP Aroldis Chapman \nFormer team: Chicago Cubs \nNew team: Yankees \nBreakdown: After helping the Cubs win the World Series, Chapman returns to the Yankees with the richest contract by a relief pitcher -- five years, $86 million. He's the premier closer in the game, saving 182 career games over seven seasons with an 89.7% save percentage. Equipped with a 100+ mph fastball, his career 15.2 strikeouts per 9 innings is the highest rate in MLB history (min. 250 IP). 4. RHP Mark Melancon \nMark Melancon saved 41 games last season. (Photo: Eric Risberg, AP) \nWashington Nationals \nNew team: San Francisco Giants \nBreakdown: Melancon joins a strong playoff contender who should get plenty of chances to save games and steady a shaky 2016 bullpen. Last season, he went 47 for 51 in save opportunities in 75 relief appearances for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Nationals. Over the past three seasons, the three-time All-Star averaged 43 saves and pitched to a 1.85 ERA. 5. OF Adam Eaton \nFormer team: White Sox \nNew team: Nationals \nBreakdown: Will Eaton justify the high price tag needed to acquire him? Offensively, he's the ideal leadoff batter with speed and a career .357 on-base percentage. 6. OF Dexter Fowler \nFormer team: Cubs \nNew team: St. Louis Cardinals \nBreakdown: In need of a leadoff hitter and center fielder, the Cardinals signed the free agent to a five-year, $82.5 million deal. Fowler's biggest value is his ability to reach base. In 2016, he posted a .393 on-base percentage and .840 on-base plus slugging percentage for the World Series champion Cubs. 7. 1B Ian Desmond \nFormer team: Texas Rangers \nNew team: Colorado Rockies \nBreakdown: Desmond, who has never played first base in the major leagues, will make the transition thanks to a five-year, $70 million deal. A career shortstop who moved to center field last season with the Rangers, he brings speed and versatility to a powerful lineup. 8. RHP Wade Davis \nFormer team: Kansas City Royals \nNew team: Cubs \nBreakdown: Davis, acquired for outfielder Jorge Soler, takes over the closing duties for Chapman. Since 2015, when he took over the closer role with the Royals, he converted 44 of 48 save opportunities and had a 10.2 strikeouts per nine inning ratio. 9. LHP Drew Smyly \nFormer team: Tampa Bay Rays \nNew team: Seattle Mariners \nBreakdown: Despite an ugly 4.88 ERA in 2016, Smyly had career highs in starts (30) and innings pitched (175 2/3) last season with the Tampa Bay Rays. And paired with a defensive trio that figures to roam the outfield at Safeco Field, the move should be beneficial for the left-hander. 10. DH Kendrys Morales \nFormer team: Royals \nNew team: Blue Jays \nBreakdown: Morales replaces the vacancy left by Encarnacion. While he won't be able to match Encarnacion's power, he's coming off a solid season with the Royals in which he belted 30 homers and had 93 RBI with a .795 on-base-plus-slugging percentage. He should also complement Josh Donaldson and Jose Bautista in the lineup.
