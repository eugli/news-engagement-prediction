The Bayern manager has admitted that four Gunners players are in their thoughts. \nArsenal did well to top their Champions League group with PSG and celebrated the fact that for once they wouldn't have to play one of the competition's biggest clubs. \nOf course they didn't expect perennial semi-finalists and above Bayern to finish second in their group and as inevitable as a Granit Xhaka booking the two clubs were paired together. \nWith the return of the Champions League comes the return of what must be the most played out fixture in the tournament in recent years and speaking ahead of the match Carlo Ancelotti has named four players who have the most quality for the Gunners: \n\"This group of Arsenal players is really good because most are young with lots of quality. But there is a good mix of experience. \n\" Their most important players have lots of quality. Alexis [Sanchez], [Mesut] Ozil, [Olivier] Giroud and [Theo] Walcott. Up front they are a very dangerous team.\" \nIt would be nigh on impossible to argue against Sanchez being in that list of four players but with his quality and form upfront it's unlikely that Giroud will start. \nThat puts Arsenal down to three important players however there are serious concerns that Ozil will be dropped by Wenger tonight because of his poor form. \nWith Theo Walcott being the most incredibly unreliable player when it comes to consistency it could mean Arsenal down to just one of their defacto most important players actually in form and on the pitch. \nIt doesn't bode well! \nThen again if PSG finished second of their group with Barca topping theirs and Arsenal finished above the French champions then surely this match will finish 6-0 to Arsene Wenger's team. \nWe can dream...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:03:43.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
