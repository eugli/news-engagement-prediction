The flag, which measures 52ft by 27ft, is believed to be the oldest surviving Tricolour as it is thought it was on the ship at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Nelson's trusted flag captain Sir Edward Berry gifted the flag to the City of Norwich after its capture and it was put on display at St Andrew's Hall in the city in the late 1800s. Généreux was one of only two ships to escape the British attack at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798 but Nelson's men caught up with the vessel two years later The flag was put on public display at Norwich Castle in 1905 for the Battle of Trafalgar centenary year It was last shown publicly at Norwich Castle in 1905 for the Battle of Trafalgar centenary but it has been kept in storage ever since because of its huge size and fragility. It will be the centrepiece of an exhibition exploring Nelson's relationship with his home county of Norfolk this summer and conservationists had to find a space big enough to unfurl it and carry out checks and cleaning at its previous home St Andrew's Hall. Norwich Castle costume and textiles curator Ruth Battersby-Tooke said: 'The Ensign is remarkable for its survival in such a complete state, given its age and inherent fragility. 'It is emblematic of Norfolk Museums Service's Nelson collections, the oldest French Ensign in the UK and the one with the most stirring and thrilling history. 'When we conceived the exhibition we were determined to find a way of putting the flag on display. 'This has not been without its challenges, not least finding a space large enough to unroll the flag to condition check it and begin the conservation process. 'It was incredibly moving to be able to unroll the Ensign in the space where it had been on display until 1897.' The flag will be on display from July 29 to October 1. 'Forget Trafalgar... the Battle of the Nile was Nelson's finest hour' Lord Admiral Nelson is perhaps best known for the Battle of Trafalgar but historians say it is not his most significant conflict Many historians agree that the Battle of the Nile was more significant than Trafalgar, the battle in which Nelson died. It was during this conflict that Généreux was nearly taken by the Lord Admiral's men but the ship managed to escaped - only to be captured two years later. In August 1798, the French were at anchor in Aboukir Bay in shallow water, using the shore to protect the south-western side of the fleet, while the north-eastern faced open sea. Although the ships were chained together, Nelson believed the chain between the last ship in the line and the shore was sunk deep enough to let a vessel pass. In a daring night-time manoeuvre, his fleet slipped through the gap and attacked the French on their unprotected side. The battle established Britain as the dominant sea power during the French revolutionary wars and was immortalised in the poem Casablanca, known for its opening line 'The boy stood on the burning deck'. Nelson's flagship during the battle was the Vanguard. Other British ships commemorated by surviving copses include the Minotaur, Defence, Swiftsure, Theseus, Orion, Bellerophon and Alexander. Stephen Fisher of the National Trust said: 'The Battle of the Nile in 1798 was one of Nelson's most significant clashes with Napoleon. 'Forget Trafalgar, this was Nelson's finest hour and at the time was his most famous victory. Share or comment on this article \nA pointless relic of British Imperialism - bin it. ...
