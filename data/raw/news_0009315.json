The incident which took place in China shows the car speeding through foggy roads. A glimpse of the speedometer can be seen where the speeds exceed 250mph. According to a Daily Mail report, the car was driving recklessly and even overtook a lorry at high speed. Footage shows the aftermath of the crash with the supercar - an Audi R8 GT, completely unrecognisable save for its rear end. The roof of the car has completely caved in and the front is nowhere to be seen. Both the driver and the passenger were reported to have been thrown from the vehicle resulting in their immediate death. The R8 GT is a specialised version of the base Audi R8 boasting increased engine power, and a lighter body which allowed it to go faster than the original model. The going price for such cars in the UAE is at Dh750,000. Watch the footage of the accident in the video below. https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QKQS4kX-HM</a>\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen> - keith@khaleejtimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:50:02.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
