Alan Jamieson/Newcastle University Hirondellea gigas are voracious scavengers that consume anything that comes down from the surface. \nAlong with the nearly 7-mile deep Mariana trench in the North Pacific, Jamieson’s team deployed landers to Kermadec, a slightly shallower trench in the South Pacific. Amphipods collected from both of these remote locations were found to contain “extraordinary levels of persistent organic pollutants.” \nThe contaminants, including industrial polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers, or PBDEs, were found “ in all samples across all species at all depths in both trenches ,” at levels “considerable higher than documented for nearby regions of heavy industrialization,” according to the findings. \nDisturbingly, the highest levels of PCBs ― compounds widely used in electrical equipment until they were banned in the 1970s ― were detected in Mariana trench at concentrations 50 times that of crabs from China’s heavily polluted Liaohe River. \nThe researchers say the most logical explanation for the accumulation of these toxic compounds in such isolated areas is that plastic marine debris and dead animals contaminated at the surface sank through the water column. Once at the bottom, they were consumed by deep-sea species. \nJamieson stressed that the legacy we humans are leaving behind is not a good one and that the findings “really bring home the long term, devastating impact that mankind is having on the planet.” \n“We’re very good at taking an ‘out of sight, out of mind’ approach when it comes to the deep ocean but we can’t afford to be complacent,” he said in a statement.
