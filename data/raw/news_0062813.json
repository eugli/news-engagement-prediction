The Benicia Police Department first gifted him a bicycle, and then started a GoFundMe campaign that quickly raised more than $40,000. Duncan recalls walking home late one night when he said he saw the flashing lights of a police car come up behind him.\n\"I said, 'Uh-oh, I hope I didn’t do anything,'\" Duncan told InsideEdition.com.\nCorporal Kirk Keffer, with the Benicia Police Department, pulled up behind him, and waved him over.\n\"It’s dark; there’s no sidewalks,\" Keffer said. \"I asked him where he was walking to, and he says, 'Home.'\"\nSo, Keffer offered Duncan a ride.\nAlong the way, Duncan mentioned his car had broken down, and he had no other way to get to and from his job than to walk nearly five hours both ways.\n“I had to start saving up little by little,” Duncan said, explaining that his paychecks went toward helping out his parents, paying tuition for college, and saving up for a new car. \"It’s a pretty peaceful walk. I just put in my headphones, play my music.\"\nKeffer said he was impressed, and sympathetic to his cause.\n\"People use [a long commute] as an obstacle not to work,\" Keffer said. \"I wanted to make sure that he understood a good work ethic and dedication like that is going to be noticed and rewarded.\"\nKeffer went back to his department after dropping the teen off, and asked his superiors if there was anything they could do for him.\nThey eventually gathered some extra money from their department’s account, and surprised Duncan with a brand new bicycle.\n\"He helped make my life easier,\" Duncan said, adding that his commute time was reduced to only 50 minutes in one direction. \"They care about their community , they care about their people and they care to help us.\"\nInspired by what good a little money could do, the police department then started a GoFundMe page for Duncan that turned his life upside down just months later.\n\"Every chance we get to help somebody out we try to do it,\" Keffer said.\nWatch: Deputy Responds To Girl, 19, Who Stole His Bike to Get Home Safely: 'It Had to be Scary For Her'\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/21809-deputy-responds-to-girl-19-who-stole-his-bike-to-get-home-safely-it-had", "http://www.insideedition.com/", "http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/21596-k9-dog-spontaneously-licks-and-nuzzles-his-handler-during-photo-session", "http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/21722-woman-posts-video-of-psychotic-episode-to-raise-awareness-seeing-it-is-so-different", "https://www.gofundme.com/JourdanDuncan", "http://www.beniciapoa.com/news/bpoa-news/benicia-poa-in-the-community", "http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/15049-cops-pull-over-a-car-carrying-gladys-knight-get-the-concert-of-a-lifetime", "http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/18309-mother-arrested-for-leaving-2-year-old-and-twin-4-year-old-boys-in-locked", "http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/swflash.cab", "http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/11455-watch-reaction-of-mom-with-parkinsons-when-daughter-gifts-her-with-a-new-car"], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:04:21.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
