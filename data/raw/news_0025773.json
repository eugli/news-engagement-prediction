They have steamrolled New Zealand, England and Bangladesh in a dominant home season and the captain has led from the front with three double hundreds, a sensational 167 and two half-centuries. \nKohli was in his elements in Hyderabad in the one-off Test against Bangladesh. First, he blasted an aggressive double hundred, his fourth this season. Then his shrewd tactics allowed India to fight their way to a crushing 208-run win over the hapless visitors on a flat pitch.
