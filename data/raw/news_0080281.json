Embed from Getty Images \nIt all started on Twitter earlier today, when Kait’s friend (and Bachelor 2015 winner) Whitney Bischoff reacted to the Nick buzz. \nShe tweeted, “Why does a bachelorette never get this gig @BachelorABC?!? I wanted to see @kaitlynbristowe shake her tail feather!” @people why does a bachelorette never get this gig @BachelorABC ?!? I wanted to see @kaitlynbristowe shake her tail feather! — Whitney Bischoff (@whitbisch) February 27, 2017 \nThat spurred her Bachelorette pal to drop a major behind the scenes truth bomb. \n“Actually I was offered it, had the contract,” the former dance teacher responds. “Mike Fliess [sic] told me I wasn't allowed.

Someone stop me from going on a twitter rant right now — Kaitlyn Bristowe (@kaitlynbristowe) February 27, 2017 \nThe post from Shawn Booth ’s fiancée got many of her followers talking in the comments, pointing out the potential sexist implications of Mike Fleiss’s choice. \nIn 21 previous seasons of Bachelor and 12 seasons of Bachelorette , the only stars allowed onto DWTS were four male Bachelors — Nick, Chris Soules , Sean Lowe , and Jake Pavelka — and one female contestant, Melissa Rycroft . \nThat has many wondering why it’s OK for male alums to seek “fame after the show,” but not for females to pursue similar opportunities. \nYour move Bach producers!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:21:21.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
