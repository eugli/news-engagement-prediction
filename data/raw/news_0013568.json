(Evan Vucci/AP) Trump is due to visit Britain later this year as the guest of Queen Elizabeth II. The invitation was announced by Prime Minister Theresa May when she visited Trump in Washington last month.\nBut some Britons are critical of the government’s apparent rush to get close to the divisive president.\nAn online petition opposing Trump’s state visit has more than 1.8 million signatures and will be debated by lawmakers on Feb. 20 — though they will not hold a binding vote on it.\nThousands of British protesters demand P.M. cancel Trump visit \nMay’s office said the dates and itinerary for the state visit have not yet been finalized.\nJoin the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:54:48.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
