But another taco festival happens this weekend, and the tacos will be some of the most authentic you’ve ever eaten. \nWhat’s even better is that this latest taco festival will happen every month. \nThe Feb. 12 Indy Taco Fest features eight to 10 food trucks, maybe more, serving tacos 2 to 9 p.m. at Indiana Discount Mall, 3585 Commercial Dr., in the International Marketplace neighborhood. \nMexican and Central American cooks run trucks coming to the festival, so expect tacos true to form, said Paulino Alancho, events coordinator at Indy’s Vida Latina Magazine, which is co-hosting the event with Indiana Discount Mall. However, all food trucks serving tacos are welcome to participate. Call the mall office at 317-291-6502. \nTrucks on the roster so far include El Taco Loco, 2 burros, Dos Hermanos and a truck operated by Broad Ripple’s Biscuits restaurant (home of delectable carnitas that come with even more delectable pork skins), said Indiana Discount Mall office manager Israel Ortiz. Tacos aren’t the only thing on the menu. Trucks will serve a range of Latin American food.

Some people use the tomato juice brand Clamato, but recipes vary from maker to maker. \nThe festival, featuring a karaoke contest and dancing, is free to attend. Trucks will sell food directly to attendees. \nOrganizers plan to stage a taco festival at the mall the third Sunday of every month, with each festival larger than last, Ortiz said. The idea is to share Latin American culture. \n“We try to promote unity. That’s the main idea of the taco festival,” Alancho said. “We want to get people together. Right now, there is a lot of fear in a lot of Latino communities. We want to provide a good, positive experience to get together.” \nA date has not been set for this summer's Downtown taco festival, but organizers of that event say it will probably happen in June. It's billed Tacos, Tequila and Margaritas Festival . \nFollow IndyStar food writer Liz Biro on Twitter: @lizbiro , Instagram: @lizbiro , Facebook and Pinterest .
