SUE Well, we’ll be looking on as some of Britain’s best-loved celebrities don Lycra support pants and tights to gurn, prance and sing their way into the public’s hearts and minds belting out songs by huge stars on Let’s Sing And Dance For Comic Relief. It’s going out live on four consecutive Saturdays. MEL For each show, we will have a judging panel made up of comedy royalty, from Jo Brand, Julian Clary, Miranda Hart, Paul O’Grady and Frank Skinner to Jennifer Saunders and Claudia Winkleman. In episodes 1-3, our celebs will sing, dance and do their thing and the public will vote for their favourite performance. The act with the most votes will go through to the grand final but those in second and third place have to battle it out against each other and the judges will decide their fate and pick which act makes it to the final. Strictly’s dark horse was Ed Balls. Who’ve you got in that role? MEL We’ve got Russell Grant as Diana Ross, Gogglebox’s Steph and Dom as Cher and Meat Loaf and Sara Pascoe as Sia, so take your pick. I can’t wait for some Saturday night lols! It’s primarily a dance show, so which of you has the best dance floor moves? SUE As soon as music starts in any social situation, Melly and I will always be the first to start moving. Whether those movements can be called dance, I don’t know, though Mel will keep going until four or five in the morning. MEL Perks has got the real creativity on the dance floor. I use that word loosely. But I’ve got the stamina. Mel and Sue are hosting a new show focused on dancing, involving celebrities and top comedians as the judges Do you have signature dance moves? SUE Mel’s feet rarely leave the ground, but she sort of bounces her booty. I will be sort of strutting and trying to moonwalk. MEL With Perks, there’s a lot of facial activity that goes on. There’s tautness in the torso and quite lithe hopping around the leg area, for a short space of time. Then it’s spark out. Can’t do any more. Game over. SUE I still go to Ibiza every year and cut a slight rug at Ushuaïa [the club]. I’m usually the oldest person there by about 40 years. And there’s usually some fairly wandering hands, which I’m always grateful for at my age. Let’s Sing And Dance For Comic Relief is the new show hosted by Mel & Sue Who is the most entertaining drunk? SUE I’m pretty good. It’s almost like my body overheats when I drink too much and when I’ve lost my inhibitions I think, ‘Well, now is a great time to remove my clothes.’ Like at weddings and things, if I get battered, I’ll just take my top off. Or just the trousers will unfurl and I’ll be wandering around eating canapés with my trousers down by my ankles. I only get drunk maybe two or three times a year but God I go for it, and there’s always jumping on a table, nudity and shouting. MEL But really jolly. SUE We don’t get drunk as much as we used to. But Melly, when she’s drunk... There was an incident. Paul Hollywood and I had to carry Mel, physically carry her like a sack of spuds into the hotel after a Bake Off party. I had her hands, Paul had her legs. Whereupon Melly stripped naked and stood in front of me saying, ‘You need to see this. You need to deal with your inhibitions. You need to see my naked body.’ And I kept saying, ‘I really don’t need to see you naked. I don’t have any personal inhibition but I don’t want to see your jugs right now. I just want to go to sleep.’ Both of us can be fairly entertaining. Are you disappointed that you won’t be doing Bake Off any more? MEL It was seven incredibly brilliant years. We loved every minute. And it’s going to be sad not to be doing it but we’ve got amazing memories. I don’t think it could’ve been better. SUE It was a playground, enjoyed with fantastic bakers and mates. We had no script, we were given the latitude to just look after and hang out with the bakers in whatever way we saw fit. It does sting sometimes that we’re not doing it any more, and of course it’s really sad, but we made our decision and we made it quickly, and together. MEL It felt like the right thing to do. SUE And it was the right thing. And there was no hesitation. We both wish it all the best. Hand on heart, I don’t know if I’d watch it, because that might be a bit weird, but that doesn’t mean you don’t want it to succeed in your absence. MEL And seven years is the longest we’ve ever been employed at anything. Normally we go in, we do a series and then that’s it, we’re axed! Mel and Sue say they wish the new Bake Off all the best SUE When it started, Bake Off wasn’t a big hit. Respect to the people who said, ‘We’ll keep commissioning this and give it a chance.’ Who knows whether a Bake Off would ever be allowed to succeed in the current climate, because it didn’t capture people’s imagination for years. MEL It was very dry, nary a gag in sight. We tried to lighten it up a bit and I feel proud that we set the template. SUE I feel very proud that we set the tone. We wanted it to be kind and encouraging and quintessentially British in its sense of cheek and politeness. What are you going to miss most about doing the show? MEL It’s a nostalgic thing. I don’t think there will be any rancour or bitterness when it comes on, just a nostalgic twinge. SUE Everybody made the decision that was right for them. I feel that I absolutely did the right thing and I know Melly feels the same. But that doesn’t mean I would look with antagonism at others who went on a different path. Round about late spring we will be like, ‘Can you imagine what they’re doing now? It’s probably bread week, or about the time I would be hovering over 40 Viennese whirls and making some kind of tortuous, horrific pun. But we made a decision so we’re going to enjoy the hell out of whatever comes next. MEL We’d also run out of puns. Seven years of making puns about cobs, baps, meringues. To be honest, we’d started to recycle some. Ruby Tandoh [2013 runner-up] called Paul Hollywood a ‘peacocking man-child’. How would you describe him? MEL That is so intense, what came out of Ruby’s poetry. That caught us all by surprise. SUE People feel very emotional about Bake Off and I’m not there to judge Ruby or Paul or anybody. Paul made the decision that was right for him. How would we describe Paul? MEL An annoying older brother who punches you in the shoulder. SUE Constantly punching you and annoying you and winding you up. MEL Teasing. Boring you with stories of cars. SUE When I went to the hospital when the junior doctors’ strike was on I got loads of badges saying ‘I support the junior doctors’ and we just covered Paul in them, which really annoyed him. So politically I’d say we’re quite different. But we were a family and as Mel said, he was the sort of brother you could take the mickey out of, who is permanently sat watching Formula 1. He’s a real sort of bloke, isn’t he? He likes his beer and his bikes. MEL We teased him mercilessly. SUE He always took the joke in good heart. Genuinely, we really do wish him the best. What would you say to Mary Berry if she wandered into the room right now? SUE We usually bundle her. A full Mel-Sue sandwich hug in which she is the most regal of fillings. You can pummel her around a bit, try and tickle her. She’s got really ticklish spots under the old wings. She likes a good old tickle. MEL She’d turn and say, ‘Oh, you fools!’ [Mel gets a text telling her Prue Leith looks certain to be confirmed as the new presenter of the show.] MEL I’m really glad it’s someone with her kudos and experience. It’s a very good choice. There were lots of names floating about weren’t there? People with less experience than her. She’ll be great. Let’s go back to the beginning of your friendship. What do you remember about when you first met? MEL It was in September 1988, the second Summer of Love... SUE Not for us... We have always been professionally platonic. I love this woman to death but the idea is so unsavoury. Says Sue on their relationship: 'We have always been professionally platonic. I love this woman to death but the idea is so unsavoury' MEL Perks, you’re a fine filly yourself love, but it would just be like kissing your sister, wouldn’t it? SUE Almost worse. MEL Anyway, it was a smoke-filled basement at university where there was a try-out for new material. There were loads of blokes, all quite boring. Then suddenly this little figure in a red jumper, black jeans and Doc Martens came on, fag in hand, and just did ten minutes of very freewheeling, absolutely hilarious comedy. So I went up to her and said, in a rather patronising way: ‘Hello, I’m Melanie and you’re Susan. Would you like to work together?’ SUE No, I don’t think you said that. I think we were just chatting. We both got absolutely battered, obviously. I just remember this woman with a shock of blonde hair and the most to-die-for dusty pink DMs. We just played for three years at university and it became clear that we could maybe try and work together. And we’re still trying to work together. We are the same. We’re old, the edifice has crumbled, but the energy and the personalities are still as idiotic as they were 30 years ago. Have you ever really fallen out? MEL It was in the reception area of the old BBC TV Centre. She was late. I’m always ludicrously early/on time. I said hello then turned away and pulled a face. SUE It was one of the most fully realised acts of passive aggression. MEL I’m bad on passive aggression. I know that. I need to kick that into touch. SUE Mel pulled a face at me. I just went, ‘Can you stop being a d***?’ She went, ‘OK.’ That was it, the only time in 30 years. I’m sorry, we should have a better story to end on. Yes, you should. But we’ll let you off. ‘Let’s Sing And Dance For Comic Relief’ starts on BBC1 on March 4 at 6.45pm ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T05:14:52.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
