(Submitted by Sean Landsman)\n'An every day fish'\nLandsman's was one of 4,500 entries to the category , with the winning image an oceanic white tip reef shark, and image of a woman freediving taking third place.\nAmong those big species, it was the commonplaceness of Landsman's that stood out.\n\"An eyecatching and novel image of an every day fish, shows persistence, knowledge and creativity from the photographer,\" wrote judge Alex Mustard of why it took second place.\nLandsman would hold the trigger on his camera down and hope the fish were in the frame as they rapidly approached the fish ladder. (Submitted by Sean Landsman)\nIn his caption that went along with the photo, Landsman explained how the alewife is connected to life in the Maritimes. It's used as bait for lobster traps, as well as delivering nutrients from the oceans to the waters where they spawn.\n\"It's a simple little fish, common fish found throughout the Maritimes, so to be able to share its story and hopefully raise a bit of awareness about that species, was really great.\"\n'Spraying and praying'\nTo capture the winning photo, Landsman set up at the bottom of the fish ladder in June as the migratory fish were trying to make their way upstream to spawn.\n\"You could see the fish shooting really fast through the strong current, so I just stuck my camera under the water and tried to time taking a picture when a fish would move past,\" he explained.\n\"You take as many photos as possible and hope that one of them turns out, so I got lucky.\"\nAnother photo from the day that Landsman took the award winning photo at Officer's Pond in Suffolk. (Submitted by Sean Landsman)\n\"It was June so the water's pretty cold, my hands were pretty cold, the black flies were out in force, it was a little uncomfortable but it was worth it,\" he said.\nWhen he checked his camera after one particular flurry of fish, he knew he had a winner.\n\"As soon as I saw that one, that was it, there was no one around to high-five but I was high-fiving myself.\"\nLandsman will return to the fish ladder this summer as part of a scientific project studying how the alewife use the fish ladder.
