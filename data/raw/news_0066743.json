Her husband Tamas Mezo has called for more cycle lanes and safer roads. Row: A protest against pro-cycling and pro-walking initiatives in Walthamstow (Nigel Howard) \nAsked how Mr Khan planned to respond to the protests, a spokesman said: “The Mayor fully supports the roll-out of Mini Holland schemes in Enfield, Kingston and Waltham Forest as part of his bold plans to make London a safer and easier city for cycling and walking. \n\"Alongside more segregated cycle lanes, and banning the most dangerous lorries from London’s roads, Mini Hollands and Quietway routes play an important role encouraging more people to walk and cycle in their local neighbourhoods, improving quality of life for everyone.” \nEach of the three boroughs was awarded about £30 million to introduce measures to deter “rat-running” and encourage cycling and walking.
