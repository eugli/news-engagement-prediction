I've missed you and I know you've missed being in the Senate,\" she said. \n\"We had so much fun last year together but guess what? We can't tell anyone but Cory Bernardi is going to split from the Liberal party this week so we get another gig.\" \nLiberal Senate newcomer Jonathon Duniam took exception to Ms Polley's video and returned fire via his own Facebook video. \nIn it, Mr Duniam watches Ms Polley's clip and shakes his head in distain. \n\"I don't know about you but I reckon Tasmanians taxpayers have had just about enough of this sort of silly behaviour,\" he said. \n\"People playing silly political games, filming videos talking to hats rather than focussing on the issues that actually matter to Tasmanians.\" Video: Senator Duniam not impressed with Polley's video (ABC News) \nSenator Polley was quick to post another video in response. \n\"When he comes and has a go at me for doing a video in the Senate chamber, the lesson here for you Senator Duniam is I've been here in the Senate for 12 years. I've been standing up fighting for Tasmanian services,\" she said. 'Puerile' behaviour falls flat on voters: Wilkie \nIndependent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie said the video exchange was immature. \n\"I think a lot of members of the community would find that juvenile or even puerile behaviour,\" he said. \n\"Members of Federal Parliament sniping each other, making what they think are funny clips, I think most people would find that completely unacceptable.\" \nMr Wilkie said the two senators should have been focused on issues like the ongoing concerns about the Centrelink debt recovery program. \n\"There are so many big issues for parliamentarians to focus on,\" he said. \nSenator Polley said it was Mr Wilkie who was not focussing on the big issues. \n\"Mr Wilkie should be talking about the things that matter the most to the people of Tasmania — like jobs, health and securing the future of the salmon industry,\" she said in a statement. \n\"Instead, Mr Wilkie is spending his time trying to stay relevant, undermining the salmon industry and talking about me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:47:43.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
