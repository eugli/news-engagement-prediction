Thus, the suit claims, he would not have entered the pool voluntarily, according to court documents obtained by PEOPLE. \nValle’s parents, Jorge and Maria Valle, are also suing the Tree House Trust that owns the home. Moore has not been named in the lawsuit. \nWong declined to comment to PEOPLE. \nThe family is seeking damages of more than $25,000, alleging that the party hosts contributed to an already “dangerous environment” by serving alcohol. \nVIDEO: Rumer Willis Gets Candid About Her Relationship With Parents Demi Moore and Bruce Willis \n\nValle’s body was found in the pool on July 19, 2015. A Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson told PEOPLE at the time that Valle was attending a small gathering of five or six people. \nAuthorities did not suspect foul play in the incident and determined the death to be accidental. \nMoore was out of town when the party took place and authorities said that none of Moore’s relatives were present when the body was found. \nThe actress later expressed her grief in a statement to PEOPLE, saying that she was “in absolute shock” over the tragedy. \n“I was out of the country traveling to meet my daughters for a birthday celebration when I got this devastating news,” she said. “The loss of a child is an unthinkable tragedy, and my heart goes out to this young man’s family and friends.” \nThe lawsuit alleges that Valle was not warned about the “abundant dangerous conditions at the premises,” including the pool — which the suit claims was 9 to 10 feet deep.
