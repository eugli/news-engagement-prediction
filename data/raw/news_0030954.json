The law gives priority and immediately recognition to biological parents. Personally, I think that’s appropriate. A non-biological person would need to make an application to the court — with which, of course there are no guarantees,” says Dowd. \nThis application could be to become foster carer, for instance. \n“This man would have a right to put his hand up and make an application through the Family Law Act. He is a person with a genuine and legitimate interest in the child’s life. Proceedings after an application would vary; they would take weeks rather than months.” \nAre the odds stacked against him because he’s a man trying to take on the Family Court which is well known to show gender bias towards women? \n“As a matter of law, fathers don’t have fewer rights than mothers but as a matter of practice it’s something we certainly see,” says Dowd. \n“Sociologically we have an expectation children will be with the mother. There is an in-built prejudice about fathers having children, particularly if they’re not the biological parents.” \nWHAT’S NEXT FOR MIKE*? \nAfter his story was published, Mike says he was overwhelmed by the supportive comments and he’s not giving up his fight to care for the baby. But there’s been another development. \n“Unfortunately now, the mother has named another man as the potential biological father,” Mike tells news.com.au \n“I now have him and his family to contend with. I asked the biological family if they could include me in her life. They said no. I’ve told them I will fight. \n“My lawyer is applying for access at this point, until the biological father has been assessed.” \nHOW IS THE CARER DECIDED? \n“Wherever possible a child lives with the mother. However, in this case, the mother was found to have no attachment so it wasn’t found to be in the child’s best interest,” Dowd says. \nIn this case, the mother has been asked if she can identify another potential biological father. And once the biological father has been established, he will be given parental rights. \nImportantly, if a mother is found to have no attachment or have drug issues at an initial custody hearing, that doesn’t mean she loses all rights to her child. \n“This would remain under constant review. If the mother has a drug problem and can show in a year’s time that she has that under control, parental supervision would be reassessed. She can, at any time say, ‘Can I have my baby back now please?’” \n“In complicated matters like this, it’s important to get the right advice, from people who are up to date with new developments in the law — and ask all the right questions even if they’re difficult.” \n*Names have been changed to protect identities.
