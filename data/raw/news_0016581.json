Afterwards, Moore killed himself.\nVictims Paddy Loughran, Michael O'Dwyer and Pat McBride pictured. Speaking outside the party headquarters on Saturday, Mr Adams said: “We need to learn to face up to all of these difficulties that we have survived in the past.\n“We need to reiterate in a real way that our task is to build a society based on core values and in so far as I speak personally about people that I know, that I worked with and joked with, and people who worked in this office behind me, I want to stress that we appreciate that others bore the same difficulties.\n“What we want to do is make sure that this never, ever happens again. And that means both governments and all the parties facing up to their responsibilities and building an Ireland that will be worthy of the children and the grandchildren that lost their lives here and in other places throughout the north.”\nRelatives at the ceremony to mark the 25th anniversary of the shooting at the Falls Road office. Credit: UTV Mr Adams also took the opportunity to again criticise the Secretary of State James Brokenshire’s stance on legacy issues.\nHe added: “This is about obstructing the truth - it’s totally contrary to the agreement that was made between us and others and the two governments two years ago into these legacy issues.\n“They use these ridiculous excuse about national security to close down legacy inquest and they refuse to fund those inquests. What they want is immunity for British soldiers and others who were responsible for beatings, torture, for murder.”\n Politics troubles Northern Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:03:58.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
