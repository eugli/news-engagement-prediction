Australian newcomer Tash Sultana knows a lot about timing. The 21-year-old Melbourne artist is a self-taught loopologist, singer and beat boxer, whose sublime talents have managed to remain a well-kept secret within Australia’s music community for the past couple years. Not any longer. \nJust days out from her first headlining tour of the United States, the 21-year-old multi-instrumentalist is catching a lot of attention online with an unexpected cover. \nSultana was a guest in the Triple J studios last week for the Aussie broadcaster’s weekly Like a Version series, where artists are typically asked to perform one of their originals, and a cover. \nFor her cover, Sultana ripped apart and rebuilt MGMT’s \"Electric Feel,\" the video for which is closing in on three million views on Facebook . MGMT's disco-infused delight from 2007 is now, ten years on, reimagined as a sonic dreamscape. And for her original, Sultana launched into “Jungle,” her trademark song which came in at No. 3 on Triple J’s Hottest 100 countdown last month. \nThe viral video dropped ahead of Sultana’s first headline U.S. tour, which starts Tuesday at the Berklee College of Music, Boston. Sultana has partnered with Mom + Pop to release her Notion EP in America on Friday (Feb. 17) and she’ll return in the fall for another headlining run, including a show at the Bowery Ballroom. Timing, yeah, it’s pretty important. \nCheck Sultana's website for dates and watch her performances for Triple J below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:36:47.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
