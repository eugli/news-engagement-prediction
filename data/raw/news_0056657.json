She does it dozens of times a day - when she's asleep, awake, in the garden, waiting for her food. 'We first noticed her smile four years ago, in 2013, when she was asleep one day. I just noticed and said to my husband 'I'm sure she is smiling'. Buffy's owners said the first time they noticed she was smiling she was fast asleep Proud Jill has even framed photographs of her smiling pooch 'Suddenly she woke up and gave me this most amazing smile, I just managed to capture it on camera. Now we have thousands of pictures of her grinning at us - it is just hilarious. 'I think she was probably always smiling even before then, she must have always done it but maybe we just hadn't noticed. Now when I look back on some of the old pictures of her I can see the smile there too. 'Everyone notices her smile and people keep asking where it comes from. But lots of people have even asked me if the pictures of her are photoshopped. 'They don't believe her smile could be real and ask to see more pictures to prove it. The spoilt pooch enjoys an annual birthday cake and when she was recently diagnosed with arthritis Jill and Dave purchased special stairs to help her access their bed and sofa Owner Jill says: 'People ask me to send pictures of her to make them feel better if they are having a really bad day' The pampered pooch joins her owners on every family holiday 'People ask me to send pictures of her to make them feel better if they are having a really bad day. She just has this special quality about her that really cheers everyone up.' Jill and roofer husband Dave Cox, 53, got Buffy when she was an eight-week-old puppy in 2003 and she will celebrate her 14th birthday this September. And the pampered pooch, who joins the Coxes on every family holiday, is also much-loved by the couple's son Adam, 22, and 26-year-old machinist daughter Claire. Adam suffers from rare heart condition postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) and is often housebound but Jill said Buffy is able to sense when her son is having a particularly hard day. Jill and her roofer husband Dave Cox (pictured) got Buffy when she was an eight-week-old puppy in 2003 It appears Buffy is even a fan of her own smile - as she appears delighted looking at her reflection The spoilt pooch enjoys an annual birthday cake and when she was recently diagnosed with arthritis Jill and Dave purchased special stairs to help her access their bed and sofa. Jill said: 'Some people think it is just something she does with her mouth but I think Buffy's smile is a genuine smile in the same way a human would smile - when she does it you can see she is happy. 'Her smile sums up her character really, she is a very happy dog and is just one of a kind. She is very spoilt and pampered but very clever too. She is just known for her smiling face. 'Wherever we go she is with us. We are very proud of her, she is a little star, and everyone says how amazing she is.'
