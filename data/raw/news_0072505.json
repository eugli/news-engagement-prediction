Keith Ellison of Minnesota, whom the Bernie Sanders wing of the party had rallied round. \n“We need a chair who cannot only take the fight to Donald Trump. … We also need a chair who can lead a turnaround and change the culture of the Democratic Party,” Perez said. \nThe ascendance of an establishment liberal is certain to renew tension between veteran party stalwarts and the unruly progressive movement aligned with Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, both of whom backed Ellison. \nSome Ellison supporters erupted in protest as the final vote was announced. \nPerez quickly sought to unite the party by naming Ellison his deputy chair, a move unanimously approved by the 435 assembled delegates, who had supported Perez 235-200.
