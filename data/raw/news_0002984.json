Georgia defensive back Trey Creamer has seen his recruiting take a few twists and turns as it heads towards signing day. After a coaching change at Minnesota, where he had been committed since October, the 6-foot-0, 175-pound Creamer started looking at his options again and made official visits to Iowa, Rutgers, and Colorado State this month.\nToday, the three-star prospect decided on new home at Iowa and verbally committed to the Hawkeyes.\n\"I am so very blessed to have been afforded the opportunity to continue my education and football career at many outstanding universities around the country,\" Creamer said in a statement Monday night. \"I was able to take all five official visits and each and every staff and school treated me with the upmost respect. I sincerely thank them all for the opportunity to represent them over the next four years.\"\n\"But after much thought, careful and prayerful consideration, I have decided to commit to the University of Iowa and will be signing a Letter of Intent on Wednesday.\"\nüê§üê§üê§‚úäüèæ pic.twitter.com/ayVRfYImO4\n‚Äî #Ô∏è‚É£Trey_Creamer1Ô∏è‚É£ (@Trey_CreamerxD) January 31, 2017 Creamer is commitment No. 17 for the Iowa Hawkeyes in the Class of 2017.\nSee highlights from Creamer's senior year at Cartersville High School in the video below.\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/pgk0mdis7kejm78cqqmf", "https://twitter.com/Trey_CreamerxD/status/826218617419218944", "https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/pgk0mdis7kejm78cqqmf)", "https://t.co/ayVRfYImO4"], "published": "2017-01-31T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T17:30:14.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
