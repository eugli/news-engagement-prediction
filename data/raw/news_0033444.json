Hunter Thomas, TheFourthTurn.com Pulliam Leads Stout Field At Myrtle Beach Former National Champ Strong In IceBreaker Practice Hunter Thomas, TheFourthTurn.com Tweet \nMYRTLE BEACH, S.C. - The NASCAR Whelen All-American Series (NWAAS) hit the banks of Myrtle Beach Speedway on Friday in preparation for Saturday’s 2nd annual IceBreaker that will be held on Saturday. \nDrivers from all over the East Coast have traveled to the Palmetto State this weekend to try and win the prestigious event. The IceBreaker is a lock-in to the Myrtle Beach 400, and the winner of Saturday’s event will take home a $5,000 purse. On Friday, more than 20 drivers took to the track as Myrtle Beach Speedway hosted five NWAAS practice sessions. \nLee Pulliam, 2013 Myrtle Beach 400 winner, was very strong throughout practice on Friday. The Virginia native didn’t clock a lap in opening practice, but in the second session, he ran a lap of 20.670 and topped the speed chart. Pulliam followed the effort up by winning the third round of practice after running a lap of 20.697. In the fourth session, he was third, and in the final session, Pulliam clocked the sixth fastest lap. \n“I think that the car has been pretty good,” Pulliam said. “We have been working our butts off on it. We’ve tried a lot of stuff, and we’re still trying stuff.” \nBack in November, Pulliam, who finished third in the Myrtle Beach 400, had a prime seat if the JR Motorsports drivers of Christian Eckes and Josh Berry didn’t make it to the finish line during their thrilling photo finish. Despite only racing at Myrtle Beach Speedway a few times a year, Pulliam intends on performing well and contending for the win on Saturday. \n“This place is just tough, and so we don’t come here but twice a year, so it makes it tough on us,” Pulliam said. “We don’t have a big notebook here, but we had a lot of speed, and the car is driving good, which is the main thing. I feel good about it. As far as our expectations, we don’t leave the shop unless we’re planning on trying to win the race.” \nMyatt Snider is also a former Myrtle Beach Speedway winner, who was fast during Friday’s practice sessions. The 2015 Myrtle Beach 400 winner started off the day slow, only clocking the 16th fastest lap, but he was runner-up during the second and fourth rounds of practice. Snider finished out the afternoon eighth on the speed chart during the final session. \n“We’ve been really fast,” Snider said. “Brandon Grosso (Cunningham Motorsports teammate) has been doing really well too, so I think we will both be good in the race, and I just feel good about going into it, and I’m glad to have Louisiana Hot Sauce on the car. I’m feeling pretty good about it.” \nThe IceBreaker that’s only in its second year bring a lot of momentum and excitement to the local South Carolina racing community. Being so early in the season, drivers are able to get a jump start on the 2017 season and in a big way, too. With a stout field, drivers are able to get an early reading on where they stack up against the competition. Winning the IceBreaker also ensures a big check and having a lock into the biggest race that Myrtle Beach Speedway hosts. \n“It brings a lot of people out before the season really gets going,” said weekly Myrtle Beach Speedway competitor, Sam Yarbrough said. “You can see where you are and the gains that you’ve made during the off-season, how you stack up against the competition. There’s a lot of great competition here, a lot of great drivers from all over the Southeast and the North as well, so it’s a great event to really get the ball rolling for the season.” \nTickets to Saturday’s IceBreaker are only $15 for grandstand admission. Kids 12-years old and younger enter the gates for free, and the speedway also has discounts for locals, military and seniors. \nGrandstands will open at noon on Saturday, and fans will be able to watch qualifying for all of the divisions competing at the track this weekend. Racing is set to begin at roughly 1:45 p.m. The Vintage cars will compete first, followed by the Mini Stocks, Chargers, Modifieds and then the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series. \nPractice No. 1 Top-Five Results: 1.) #11 Lucas Williams | 20.867 seconds2.) #16 Colby Howard | 21.052 seconds3.) #02 Justin Milliken | 21.082 seconds4.) #61 Justin Hicks | 21.104 seconds5.) #32G Brandon Grosso | 21.106 seconds \nPractice No. 2 Top-Five Results: 1.) #5 Lee Pulliam | 20.670 seconds2.) #2 Myatt Snider | 20.922 seconds3.) #5C Tyler English | 21.014 seconds4.) #16 Colby Howard | 21.121 seconds5.) #61 Justin Hicks | 21.163 seconds \nPractice No. 3 Top-Five Results: 1.) #5 Lee Pulliam | 20.697 seconds2.) #95 Chad McCumbee | 20.719 seconds3.) #27 Tommy Lemons Jr. | 20.909 seconds4.) #16 Colby Howard | 20.953 seconds5.) #8 Tyler Hughes | 20.981 seconds \nPractice No. 4 Top-Five Results: 1.) #30 Brian Vause | 20.787 seconds2.) #2 Myatt Snider | 20.901 seconds3.) #5 Lee Pulliam | 20.940 seconds4.) #83 Jeremy McDowell | 20.970 seconds5.) #61 Justin Hicks | 21.029 seconds \nPractice No. 5 Top-Five Results: 1.) #60 RA Brown | 20.984 seconds2.) #61 Justin Hicks | 21.003 seconds3.) #83 Jeremy McDowell | 21.029 seconds4.) #32G Brandon Grosso | 21.033 seconds5.) #32 Jerry Miracle | 21.053 seconds \nMyatt Snider (2) was among the fastest in Friday's practice sessions for the Late Model Division at South Carolina's Myrtle Beach Speedway.
