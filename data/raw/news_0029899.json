It’s embarrassing and speaks of ignorance.” \nThe USTA said in a statement: “We extend our sincerest apologies to the German Fed Cup team and all of its fans for the performance of an outdated National Anthem prior to today’s Fed Cup competition. \n“In no way did we mean any disrespect. This mistake will not occur again, and the correct anthem will be performed for the remainder of this first-round tie.” \nPetkovic went on to lose her singles match against America’s Alison Riske, before rain held up the contest between Julia Goerges and Coco Vandeweghe.
