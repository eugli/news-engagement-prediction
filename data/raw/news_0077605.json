He was the sixth of eight children growing up in the Philadelphia area. He served in the Army in World War II and it had a profound impact on his life and how he treats others. He was a liberator at Dachau, and he served as a military observer at the war trials in Nuremberg. \nArchie has seen much in his 90 plus years on Earth, but he exudes happiness and joy. He’s a local celebrity, having been the Grand Marshall in the local holiday parade. He’s also thrown out the first pitch on Opening Day for the Flemington Little League. \nBut none of it is as important as his day job, greeting the customers at the Shop Rite in Flemington with a smile.
