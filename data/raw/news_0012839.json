As vehicles can be seen tumbling around her, the woman just looks back once and keeps walking as if nothing has happened.\nThe video has been shared several times on the social media as people are left shocked by the woman’s devil may care attitude after causing a terrible accident, since she didn’t even bother to check who got hurt.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/aPQZw2IcDhw"], "published": "2017-02-06T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:51:36.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
