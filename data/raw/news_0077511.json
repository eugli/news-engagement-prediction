The Câ€™s, however, answered that with an 18-3 run of their own. Boston scored at will in the paint during its run, getting layups on four straight possessions at one point.

Thomas led all scorers with 16 points in the half, while Reggie Jackson paced the Pistons with 15. \nSLOPPY THIRD The Câ€™s started the third quarter on a 13-2 run to stretch their lead to 15 but were unable to bury the Pistons due to sloppy play on both ends. Boston turned the ball over 10 times in the period and allowed Detroit to get multiple second-chance opportunities. The Celtics only were able to keep the Pistons at bay thanks to the play of Rozier off the bench.

A Smart put-back gave the Celtics a brief lead, but Caldwell-Pope drained a trey to give Detroit a two-point lead with under two minutes to play. \nThe Celtics trailed by one with 37 seconds to play, when Brown knocked down a corner 3-pointer while being fouled by Marcus Morris to give Boston a two-point lead. Free throws by Smart, Thomas and Crowder put the game on ice for the Câ€™s. \nPLAY OF THE GAME ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:03:20.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
