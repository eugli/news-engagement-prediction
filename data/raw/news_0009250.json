On Wednesday Gov. Susana Martinez announced the construction of the solar farms will bring 300 new jobs to the project. On top of that, Affordable Solar will be hiring 40 additional employees in connection to the project. Facebook's multibillion-dollar data center campus in Los Lunas will be built just off… more Courtesy Facebook “Not only is Facebook’s massive data center expected to create thousands of long-term construction jobs – it’s also sending a message to companies across the globe that New Mexico is open for business,” Martinez said as part of the announcement. “Bringing Facebook to New Mexico was a big step in the right direction, but we have to continue building on our progress to diversify our economy and create even more jobs for our families.” The Affordable Solar project will span more than half a million square feet in its initial phase. According to a release, Facebook will power the facility with 100 percent renewable energy created by solar and wind farms. The first solar farm is expected to be completed by January of next year, with the data center expected to also open in 2018. Public Service Co. of New Mexico has committed to providing 100 percent renewable energy for the Facebook project. PNM spokesman Dan Ware said PNM is financing the $45 million project, which Facebook will then repay. \"PNM is the provider of power and energy for the facility and is coordinating for the renewable energetic requirements and needs for the project,\" Ware said. Also announced Wednesday was that Array Technologies will be providing solar tracking equipment for the project. “The solar industry is flourishing in New Mexico, not only because of our abundant sunshine, but also because of strong support from PNM, local communities and our state policy makers, especially Gov. Martinez,” said Kevin Bassalleck , President of Affordable Solar, in a statement. “The growth of solar benefits everyone, providing local jobs, economic growth and clean energy that together help improve the quality of life in New Mexico.” This story will be updated throughout the day.
