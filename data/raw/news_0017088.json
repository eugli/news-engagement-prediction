Tyra Banks was put on the boycott list for her work on the current season of The New Celebrity Apprentice , on which President Donald Trump has retained the title of executive producer. Banks appears as an advisor promoting her makeup and skincare brand Tyra Beauty . Boycott organizer Shannon Coulter tells Racked that Banks is now being removed from the list after a phone call with the former supermodel and current beauty CEO yesterday in which she pledged not be involved with the show going forward. “We want to make it clear that Tyra Beauty is not an active sponsor of The Celebrity Apprentice series and does not plan to become one in the future,” a Tyra Beauty spokesperson further clarified in a statement. “Filmed a year ago, our involvement was limited to showcasing Tyra Beauty’s innovative cosmetics products.” As per Coulter, “I think what we’re seeing right now is consumer power acting as a direct and substantial check to a presidential administration out of step with core American values of equality and inclusivity. Fortunately, in the United States, money talks. The women of this nation are showing it walks too.” Jessica Alba, who appears as an advisor on the show promoting her personal care brand The Honest Company, was also removed from the list earlier today. According to the Grab Your Wallet website, the brand will not be working with the show again either. Banks and Alba’s decision comes on the heels of retailers like Nordstrom , Neiman Marcus , Belk , HSN , and ShopStyle backing away from Trump family brands. Racked has reached out to Tyra Beauty, The Honest Company, and NBC.
