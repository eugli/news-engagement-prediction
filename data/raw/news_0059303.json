He made 81 percent of his field goal tries for the Jets from 2010-16. \nFolk, 32, was due to make $3 million in the one season remaining on his contract. \n“It’s a sad day, but that’s the business side of things,” Folk told the Jets’ official website. “I had a great seven years here. I think the only thing that would’ve topped it off would’ve been a couple of Super Bowl wins.” \nGiacomini started 37 games in three seasons with the Jets. He was a full-time starter in his first two years but was limited to five games last season by a back injury. He also had one year left on his contract and was due to make $4.5 million in 2017.
