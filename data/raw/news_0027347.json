The March/April issue cover boasts the appropriate headline, \"Naked is the new normal.\"\nChief creative officer Cooper Hefner said on Twitter the way the magazine previously featured nude models was \"dated,\" but he believed getting rid of all nudity was not the right choice.\n\"Nudity was never the problem because nudity isn't a problem,\" Hefner, who is the son of founder Hugh Hefner, posted on Twitter. \"Today we're taking our identity back and reclaiming who we are.\"\nTweet\nPlayboy previously told CNBC it adopted the non-nude policy to get more mainstream readers and advertisers. In May 2015, the company launched a safe-for-work app . Less than a year later, the magazine did away with naked women. The first issue in the new format was March 2016, which hit 1,200 more newsstands and had a 55.5 percent increase in advertising compared to the issue from the year before.
