Story continues below \n“The journey will transport you in comfort from the heart of downtown Vancouver, across the Strait of Georgia, through the unforgettable beauty of the Southern Gulf Islands, right into Victoria’s historic Inner Harbour, and back again,” reads the company’s website. \nThe company says it’s offering three tiers of fares, ranging from $120 in ‘premium comfort’ class to $240 in ‘royal class,’ all one way. \n“We are looking to offer that authentic, luxurious premium service that brings a level of convenience that comes from leaving right from the heart of downtown of Vancouver and bringing you into the Inner Harbour,” Nick Cheong, vice president of operations at V2V Vacations, told Global News. \nSo what does paying $240 for on a one-way trip get you? \nThe company says it will offer a three-course meal, seat selection and comfy leather seats with an ocean view. \nA trip in ‘first class’ will set you back $199, but will offer very similar perks, including top deck views. \nTravelling in ‘comfort’ class will leave you in the mid-ship area with an option to buy food and beverage, all for $120. \nLet us know what you think.
