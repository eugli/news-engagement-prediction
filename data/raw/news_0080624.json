Post show appearance \nRAW went off the air with Roman Reigns and Braun Strowman's contract signing for Sunday's Fastlane event. \nSIGN UP NOW \nWill Brock Lesnar appear at Fastlane on Sunday?

Article continues below \nWith Goldberg in the building ahead of his Universal Championship match on Sunday, fans were hoping to see the two colide. \nWhat they got however, was something quite different: \nConfronted by another long time rival, Lesnar went face to face with the Big Show and would leave the giant in the centre of the ring. \nLesnar would deliver the F-5 and then leave the ring with Big Show in it - a strange usage for Lesnar who is normally a superstar that WWE try to promote as much as possible. \nOnly making use of Lesnar once the show had gone off the air may be questionable, but following the events that unfolded with the Rock following RAW last week, who knows what WWE get up to after the show ends. \nLesnar could be set for a run as the Universal Champion in the weeks following WrestleMania if Goldberg wins at Fastlane and Lesnar conquers him at WrestleMania. \nIf Lesnar is crowned the Universal Champion, his appearances could become more regular on Monday nights. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
