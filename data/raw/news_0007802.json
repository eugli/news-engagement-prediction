In the peak year of 2010, the unit sold 15,000 excavators. \nTo facilitate structural reorganization, Kobe Steel wants to take over the stake held by its Chinese partner in a joint venture in excavator and crane production and sales. It will liquidate a separate crane company that has already ended production, and also unload its minority stake in the business of wheel loaders used to carry soil and crushed rocks. \nThe company has been shrinking its Chinese capacity to build excavators for the local market to 10,500 units a year. It will further lower the figure to 5,500 units by the end of fiscal 2018. A plant in Hangzhou will produce only for export, and a Chengdu plant alone will supply the domestic market. \nReorganization of sales channels is another focus. Kobe Steel will cut off dealerships from which it has struggled to collect payments. \nDemand for foreign-brand excavators in China stood at 117,000 units in 2010, but tumbled to 27,000 units in 2015 due to the economic slowdown and other factors. \nLately, some signs are pointing to a market recovery, as infrastructure spending from the government's economic stimulus reaches even small localities. In December, the per-unit operating time of construction machinery increased 8.7% on the year in China, according to data from Komatsu 's Komtrax remote monitoring system. \nHitachi Construction Machinery now sees Chinese demand growing 31% in fiscal 2016, an upgrade of 16 percentage points from a forecast in October. \nKobe Steel also expects to generate profits from its global and Chinese construction machinery businesses in the next fiscal year, which starts in April. \nStill, China's demand for foreign-brand excavators in 2020 is expected to reach just about 30% of 2010 levels, at 38,000 units. Thus the company decided that it cannot expect a major uptick in the market. \nGrowth turns into losses \nMachinery and power generation are key businesses for Kobe Steel, along with its mainstay steelmaking. The company has sought to ride out the waves of economic cycles with multiple anchors. \nBut with China hitting the company not only in the steel business -- via a persistent glut -- but also in the construction machinery business, Kobe Steel is struggling to stay afloat. After sustaining a net loss in fiscal 2015, the company had hoped to break even for the current year through March 31. But it now expects a 40 billion yen net loss -- to mark a second straight year of red ink. \nLoss provisions of about 31 billion yen have been booked to cover 79% of accounts receivable in the Chinese construction machinery business. The rest of accounts receivables are worth 10 billion yen, including those backed by collateral assets. \nThe construction machinery segment's pretax loss had been projected at 1 billion yen but will now mushroom to 34 billion. \nUmehara said the company is employing estimates more conservative than demanded by accounting standards. \nMeanwhile for the steel operations, the company kept its earlier pretax loss forecast of 30 billion yen unchanged. Rising material costs and a time lag in passing them onto product prices are squeezing segment earnings, Umehara noted. But higher materials prices also boost valuation profit on materials inventory. \nKobe Steel had not set a target for fiscal 2016 dividends. But with earnings weak, it will pay no year-end dividend, thus skipping its annual payout. Its dividend for fiscal 2015 was 2 yen per share. \n(Nikkei)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:31:44.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
