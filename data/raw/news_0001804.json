Not necessarily. But don't answer the phone anyway. Consumers wonder what's going on with the phone calls that start \"Can Your Hear Me?\" (Photo: Susan Tompor) Consumers are warned some calls start with questions engineered to get you to say \"Yes.\" Many consumers are not reporting financial losses yet. But watch statements and bills. \nFrigid weather and brutal winter storms can get just about anyone ready to say they'd like to take a cruise. But is it possible that a simple 'Yes' to a basic question on a phone call — like \"Can you hear me?\" — could burn your wallet? Even if you don't pull out your credit card or sign up for anything? \nMany of us have heard warnings about a \"Can you hear me?\" scam. But just how does this one work? Will you really lose money if someone records you saying \"Yes\" to a basic question? \nIs it time to hit that panic button? \nNot necessarily. \nConsumer watchdogs report that some fraudsters are pretending to be calling from a cruise line. Or a home security service. Or maybe the caller pretends to be associated with Social Security benefits somehow. \nThe conversation can start out innocently enough with phrases like \"Are you the lady of the house?\" or \"Are you the homeowner?\" \nOr they're asking a lot lately: \"Can you hear me?\" \nMany variations are being used in robocalls to get a consumer to engage and say \"Yes,\" according to the consumer watchdog groups. A recorded call could be setting you up to generate proof — you said 'Yes' after all — that you signed up for a service. \nAdam Levin, chairman and founder of CyberScout and author of \"Swiped,\" said the say \"Yes\" trick is just another example of how creative robocallers and crooks have become by exploiting and tweaking a famous advertising line from Verizon, which asked \"Can You Hear Me Now?\" \n\"The caller begins the conversation by asking 'Can you hear me?'\" Levin said. \"If, and when you answer 'Yes,' the fraudster is off to the races. They simply combine the recording with other personal information they have gathered from or about you, including credit card information.\" \nEven if they don't have your banking information, the scammer might play back a person's \"Yes\" remarks and try to intimidate you into paying up, according to the Better Business Bureau. \n\"The sad thing is that it can be really effective in trapping the consumer into paying for something they're not getting the benefit of,\" Melanie Duquesnel, president and CEO of the Better Business Bureau Serving Eastern Michigan. \nThink of some kind of subscription type services that might ding your account each month. \n\"The difficulty is that the consumer may have hung up on the caller thinking they hadn't done anything wrong,\" Duquesnel said. \nDuquesnel said 62 consumers in Michigan have reported complaints about \"Can You Hear Me?\" calls in the past few days. But none reports any loss of money. The Michigan Attorney General's office reports two complaints. \nThe BBB nationwide noted in its alerts that this type of \"Yes\" scam has historically targeted small business owners but the BBB has been hearing more reports from consumers. \nMore from Susan Tompor:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:13:51.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
