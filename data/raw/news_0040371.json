But the very next day, the Information Ministry halted the no-objection certificate.\" Farooki said this meant the film could not be placed before the Censor Board until the next government order is received. \" We hope the government will withdraw the decision to stall the clearance.\"\nBangladesh's leading writer Humayun Ahmed's wife Meher Afroz Shaun had previously brought to the government's notice that a part of the film closely resembles a period in the life of her late husband. \n\"We hope the film will in no way undermine the reputation of a legendary writer like Humayun Ahmed,\" she told bdnews24.com. \nMany believe the information ministry slammed the brakes on the film immediately after Shaun went public . \nBut the information ministry's order does not provide any explicit reason for stalling the no-objection certificate for \" Doob: No Bed of Roses\". \nFarooki said he will meeting authorities on Sunday to clear the air and get the film's release back on track. \nmore to follow", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:10:41.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
