Neighborhood Health Center will transform the facility at 4233 Lake Ave. into a community health center extension site, with plans to provide primary care, pediatrics, dental and pharmacy services. Enlarge The $4.6 million project will open in phases, with primary care coming first in late spring, followed by dental services this summer and a retail pharmacy open to the community, possibly by year-end, said Joanne Haefner , CEO of Neighborhood Health Center. The project was first announced in December when the organization was awarded a federal expansion grant from the Department of Health and Human Services. Identifying the right location took some time, she said. “It’s centrally located in what we found to be the biggest area of need,” Haefner said. “Though there’s a lot of real estate there, it’s pretty hard to find a space with all the things you need for primary care, like parking and accessibility.” The site includes a large parking lot and is on several bus routes just down the street from Blasdell Elementary School. The other plus was the property owner had already completed remediations at the site, so it was shovel-ready. According to plans filed with the state Department of Health, the first phase will see renovation of 6,350 square feet for outpatient primary care services. The second phase will include renovations of another 18,850 square feet, where primary care will shift into, allowing the original space to be used for dental and support services. The building includes another 8,000 square feet available for lease to a health-related organization. The supermarket has been empty since 2002 and was previously eyed as an expanded commissary for Pine Hill Fresh Foods. So far, the Blasdell/Hamburg community has been very receptive to plans for the new facility, Haefner said. Based in the Black Rock section of Buffalo on Lawn Avenue, Neighborhood Health Center also operates extension sites at the Mattina Center on Niagara Street on the city’s West Side and in Hamburg. “We’re going to continue to develop relationships with folks to understand the neighborhood are what people are looking for in care, very similar to when we moved into the Mattina Center,” she said. Funding for the project includes federal funds, as well as agency savings and a private loan. Founded 30 years ago, the nonprofit health center is a federally-qualified health center, making it eligible for federal funding to help provide care to low-income and under-served patients. Last year, Neighborhood Health Center recorded 75,000 visits from nearly 20,000 unique patients. With the opening of the new site, revenue is projected at $16 million for 2017, while the agency’s workforce of 180 will grow by another 25-30, including entry-level positions for support staff and medical providers at all levels. With federal approvals already in hand, the agency has requested an expedited review of the application from the state DOH through its certificate-of-need process.
