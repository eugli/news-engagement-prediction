Madasani is now stable and has been discharged from the hospital. \nA third person, an American man identified as Ian Grillot, 24, who tried to intervene, also received injuries in the firing at Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe in Kansas City in the US state of Missouri. A University of Kansas Hospital spokeswoman said he is in fair condition. \nThe incident evoked outrage in the US and India, with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj expressing shock over the incident. \"I am shocked at the shooting incident in Kansas in which Srinivas Kuchibhotla has been killed. My heartfelt condolences to bereaved family,\" she said in a tweet yesterday. \nThe shooter, Adam Purinton, reportedly got into an argument with the victims and shouted \"get out of my country\" and \"terrorist\" before shooting them. \nHe reportedly provoked them into an argument asking about their presence and work in his country and how they are better than him. According to the police, Purinton left the bar after the argument and then returned with a gun and shot the three men. \nAlso on HuffPost", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:44:16.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
