Her plea in SC was rejected on Wednesday, where she sought more time to surrender. SC in lieu of VK Sasikala’s plea asked her to surrender immediately. \nHere are latest updates: VK Sasikala reaches Parappana Agrahara in Bengaluru \nSasikala on Wednesday left Poes Garden and visited Amma’s samadhi, where she payed homage and was thereafter taken to Bengaluru, where she is expected to surrender. ABP News Image \nSection 144 has been imposed in Parappana Agrahara limits, where Sasikala & Co will be kept. \n\nAfter being convicted by the court Sasikala said, her thoughts will continue to remain with the party even from inside the jail. \n\n“Only I can be jailed, not the care or concern I have for this party. Wherever I will be, my thoughts will be here,” said an emotional Sasikala. \n\nShe said she will be thinking about the party round the clock. She said the present case was “filed” by DMK and asked the partymen to strongly resist it. \n\nSasikala also said she was happy in a way that Jayalalithaa was not alive to “face difficulties,” although she said she was not bothered to undergo such problems. \n\nIn her address to party MLAs hours after her conviction, Sasikala also stressed the need for staying united and exuded confidence that Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao would invite her party to form the government. \n\nEarlier, newly elected AIADMK legislature party leader Edappadi K Palaniswami had met Rao and staked claim to form government. \n\n“For me, to form government, to set up Amma’s memorial, you should remain united,” she said. \n\nSasikala, who later left the resort where party MLAs loyal to her were put up, said no force can wean away AIADMK from her.
