Read More The Geordie Shore veterans will be joined by a host of newbies (Photo: MTV) Will they be able to keep up? (Photo: MTV) \nSo who are the newbies? \nAbbie Holborn Abbie is a real party girl (Photo: MTV) \nThe 19-year-old reckons she’s the daftest dancer there is, but will she rival Chloe’s title as queen of the dancefloor? The brunette beauty knows her way around Newcastle on a night out and won’t have any trouble keeping up with the others. \nLike many of the Geordie Shore family, Abbie has worked in a call centre, but does she have the gift of the gab to help her when Anna sends them off to work? \nParty girl Abbie doesn’t care what people think of her and reckons she’s like any other girl her age. On a night out, Abbie is looking for a guy to tash on with but first he must pass the test of the three T’s – tan, teeth and tattoos. Should someone warn Aaron? Read More Billy says he's \"radge\" (Photo: MTV) \n20-year-old Billy reckons people would describe him as ‘radge’ and that’s just as well. \nHis greatest strengths are s g but with that comes his biggest weakness, staying loyal. The Buck Squad may have their work cut out competing for the title of top shagger when Billy is introduced. \nEven though he’s a boxer, Billy, describes himself as ‘canny chilled’ and he’ll need keep calm to stay in Anna’s good books. To Billy, Geordie Shore is all about booze, birds and bust-ups and he thinks he’ll fit in because he’s a bit of a p***head himself. \nBilly’s biggest regret in life is bailing on a threesome because he had a girlfriend but this time round he’s single and game as!

According to Chelsea, she’s a ‘reet messy drunk’. Sounds like a few other Geordies we know! \nChelsea works in a bar in Newcastle so should know all about getting mortal on nights out. Hopefully she’ll be able to put some of that cocktail shaking into practice when Anna sends them off to work. \nOn a night out, Chelsea says she isn’t fussy when it comes to men and you’ll often find her swapping her heels for trainers. But don’t put a foot wrong because to impress this cutie, you’ve got to be wearing a ‘proper nice pair of shoes’. We hope you’re taking notes lads.

Known as the ‘Italian Matadora’, Elettra’s favourite things are music and nightlife and we have a feeling she’ll be at home in Newcastle. \nFollowing an appearance on Super Shore, Elettra has met Chloe before and she’s no stranger to the mortal ways of the Shore, but how will Elettra cope with the tans, tashing on and tears? \nShe’s got the leopard print tattoos but will the claws be out when Elettra is introduced to the Geordie Shore family? Read More \nEve Shannon Eve is a former Miss Sunderland contestant (Photo: MTV) \nFormer Miss Sunderland contestant, Eve, has done a season in Ibiza and should know all there is to know about getting people mortal and bonding over a shot or two. Working for Anna should be easy right? \nEve describes herself as a lovable pet – energetic but not fully house trained. Looks are deceiving with this blonde beauty as she says what she looks like on the outside does not match what is going on inside. \nEve says she is a free woman and has never had a boyfriend but will anyone catch her eye in the Geordie Shore house? Eve is open to anything and thinks you can’t help who you fall in love with. Awh! Read More \nSam Bentham Barber Sam is a class clown (Photo: MTV) \nIs 24-year-old barber Sam really a cut above the rest? Geordie Shore will put him to the test. Sam has been a topless butler for Anna before, but wasn’t in her good books after forgetting to give his bow tie back. Will she have forgiven him this time around? \nSam’s friends describe him as the class clown but he reckons he’s got brains and beauty and is obsessed with documentaries about animals and space. \nThis won’t be the first time Sam has partied in the Geordie Shore house either, who can forget that infamous crab dance? Even though Charlotte won’t be there for him to tash on with, Sam describes himself as ‘lean, keen and every girls dream’. \nHe says he’s a bit of an attention seeker, especially when it comes to girls. Will he be invited to join the Buck Squad or will old rivalries for the s**g pad resurface? Gaz we’re looking at you… Read More \nSarah Goodhart Sarah used to be going out with Marty (Photo: MTV) \nWill Sarah, 23, still have a ‘good heart’ after Geordie Shore: New Radgie Rampage? Marty’s ex previously confronted him on series three of Ex On The Beach but will it be happy families this time around? \nSarah thinks she is one hundred percent genuine and relatable, but sometimes ‘a touch unstable’. We hope professional make-up artist, Sarah, has packed her waterproof mascara then. \nBest friend, Zahida, describes Sarah as cute and sexy and we’re sure the boys are going to agree. Sarah says she is very fussy when it comes to guys and likes to refer to her exes as ‘side salads’ because she hasn’t found a main course yet. Will she fall for any of the Buck Squad’s *cough* charm? \nSarah reckons she’s actually a genius but she should have paid more attention at school. Let’s hope she’s learnt her lesson when Anna sends her out to work! \nZahida Allen Zahida is currently on Ex On The Beach (Photo: MTV) \nYou may recognise Zahida from the latest series of Ex On The Beach, but she has left the drama of the villa behind her (we hope) and returned to her home turf for Geordie Shore: New Radgie Rampage. We're sure Zahida is now used to booze and bust-ups but will it be enough to prepare her for the antics on Geordie Shore? \nShe’s a regular on nights out in Newcastle, but Zahida isn’t just a pretty face as she runs her own events and promotion business. Will she be giving Anna a run for her money? It’s best to stay on her good side or she might show you just how good she is at fire breathing. \nEven when Zahida is in a relationship, it doesn’t stop her from doing what she wants of getting what she wants. Especially when it comes to boys… Will the Geordie Shore relationship curse strike again? \nThe bronzed beauty ‘loves a good drink and a fall out’ and is ready to show how crazy a Newcastle night out really is. Zahida says she pretends that she can handle her drink, but can go from ‘zero to Zahida’d really quick’. They say first impressions count but what will the Geordie Shore family think of Zahida?
