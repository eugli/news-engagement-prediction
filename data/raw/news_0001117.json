He said: 'Thames River Watch's shocking statistics underline where huge numbers of disposable plastic bottles end up – our local rivers, which then channel thousands of them daily into the sea. 'If we're to solve the problem of plastic litter in the oceans, we need to deal with it at source. 'Bottle deposit systems are working in other countries and we should now look closely at introducing the system in the UK.' The Thames River Watch project is funded by Tideway, the company building a 'super sewer' overflow pipe 12 miles long. Andy Mitchell, Tideway's chief executive, said: 'Huge numbers of wet wipes, sanitary towels and cotton buds enter the river every year from combined sewage overflows. Not only are they unsightly – the plastic parts become part of the wider microplastics problem. Environmental charity Thames 21 said it also found mounds of wet wipes that it said were 'altering the shape of the shore' (file picture) 'The new Thames Tideway Tunnel will help stem this litter, but it's still vitally important that Londoners stop flushing wet wipes and cotton buds down the toilet.' Government targets called for about three quarters of plastic bottles to be recycled by this year. But the actual figure, based on council rubbish and public bin collections, is less than 60 per cent. That means around 15million plastic bottles a day are dumped after being used just once. Millions end up as litter, blighting the country and threatening wildlife. Plastic bottles that go into bins are burned or buried in landfill, taking 450 years to degrade. Gavin Partington, BSDA Director General, said: 'All plastic bottles are 100 per cent recyclable so there is no good reason for them to end up as litter. Soft drinks companies have been working with anti-littering organisations for many years and recycling rates have increased to nearly 60% but clearly more needs to be done. 'Deposit Return Systems (DRS) do operate effectively in some countries. 'However, DRS may not be best suited to the UK given we already have a well-established kerbside recycling system that is not found in some countries where DRS do operate. 'It's also worth remembering that DRS have not solved the problem of littering. If we really want to change people's behaviour industry, campaigners and the Government need to work together to make all forms of littering unacceptable and encourage consumers to always recycle.'
