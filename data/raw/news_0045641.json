But as Oliver pointed out, that friendliness comes with some major concerns, least of which are the way Putin treats Eastern European nations, dissenters and political opponents, and LGBTQ people. And that’s just what is known about Putin, who has been dogged by corruption accusations for much of his presidency but remains popular. \n“Experts say that he likely wants an end to U.S. sanctions, for us to endorse his pro-Assad position in Syria, to let him weaken NATO, and to recognize his annexation of Crimea, all of which would be against American interests and values,” Oliver explained. “But there seems to be a genuine danger that if unchecked, Trump may trade any or all of that away in exchange for 'getting along better,' whatever the fuck that really means.” \nTo top it all off, Oliver recruited a group of dancers to perform a techno song breaking down why that isn’t such a great idea. If the argument doesn’t stick in Trump’s head, at least the song will.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:05:47.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
