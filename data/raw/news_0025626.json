Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFaryl Makhdoom has been approached by Celebrity Big Brother bosses to go into the house for this summer's star-studded series, she's revealed. \nThe 25-year-old model, who is married to Olympic boxing champ Amir Khan, told her Snapchat followers that she's considering the offer - though she didn't reveal how much money they were trying to lure her with. \n\"Hey guys, I got asked to be on Celebrity Big Brother ... it's a very tricky one and idk if I can do it,\" she wrote in a post. \n\"I want all my followers advice. On my last Instagram post tell me whether I should or shouldn't? I want you guys to pick!

The whole point for the producers is to make you look bad,\" one warned. \n\"Big brother is a baaaad idea... public entertainment - at your expense. No offense, but with your strong personality i just think there will be so much drama and fights etc... will be bad for your public image in my opinion... specially after the whole stuff with amir and his side of the fam .... just saying, only my opinion if thats what youre asking for,\" wrote another. \nOthers thought it would be good for her career and image to show the British public what she's really like, following months of tension with Amir's family.

You should also do it so you can show your in laws how wrong they think about you! Yes shows like BB can be consuming but if you utilize the platform in a positive way it will have a good influence on the viewers of the show and also the other house mates.\" \nFaryal is yet to reveal her decision. \nIn the meantime, she and daughter Lamaisah have been following Amir from country to country as he trains - and their little girl has even been given her own pair of boxing gloves so she can follow in her dad's footsteps. Faryal and Amir have struggled through an intense few months of arguments with his family (Photo: Twitter/FaryalxMakhdoom) \nIt comes after an intense period for the married couple after Amir's family criticised her for dressing immodestly and, as Faryal claims, even assaulted her - although no charges have been brought by police.
