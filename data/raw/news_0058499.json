Apple ditched the dreaded 16GB iPhone when it released the iPhone 7 , making 32GB the phone's smallest storage option. Apple may continue the trend by making 64GB the new smallest capacity, and tossing out the 32GB option altogether. The larger-capacity iPhone 8 is said to storage 256GB of photos, video and apps. \nThe move could play a part in the pricing of the upcoming iPhone. A 256GB iPhone 7 will already set you back $849/Â£799/AUD$1,379, and the premium iPhone 8 is rumored to cost over $1,000 with the introduction of new technology like OLED displays . Limiting the smallest size to 64GB instead of 32GB could result in a higher price for the cheapest iPhone 8 option, which could dissuade some buyers. \nWhile the 4.7-inch iPhone 7S and 5.5-inch iPhone 7S Plus are believed to have a maximum of 256GB storage, the report does not offer their exact storage capacities. What the report does say is that the iPhone 7S will be more economically priced to compete against other smartphone brands. That could mean less storage to keep costs down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:47:24.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
