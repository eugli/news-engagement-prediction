A handful of wealthy individuals have already paid their way into space on missions to the International Space Station, but none have escaped Earth's orbit. \nSpaceX says it will release additional information on the team of astronauts to be included on the mission, once everyone has passed health and fitness tests. \nThe mission will use SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket, slated for its first launch this summer, and its Crew Dragon spacecraft, which is slated for a series of test missions in 2017 and 2018. \nThe commercial company, which was founded by Elon Musk, has been pushing the boundaries of space travel for years, with the help of the publicly funded NASA. \n\"Once operational Crew Dragon missions are underway for NASA, SpaceX will launch the private mission on a journey to circumnavigate the moon and return to Earth,\" SpaceX said. \"By also flying privately crewed missions, which NASA has encouraged, long-term costs to the government decline and more flight reliability history is gained, benefiting both government and private missions.\" \nMusk hailed the mission on Twitter with a simple message: \"Fly me to the moonâ€¦ OK.\" \nThe mission will launch from Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, where the original Apollo missions were based. \nSpaceX launched its first successful rocket from the historic launch pad on Feb. 19, sending an unmanned Falcon 9 rocket up to deliver supplies to the ISS. \nThe space flight company says missions to the moon are an important step on the path to its ultimate goal of \"transporting humans to Mars.\" Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:50:54.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
