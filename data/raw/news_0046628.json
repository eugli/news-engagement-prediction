The two companies said they would also share liabilities related to the breaches, which occurred in 2013 and 2014 but were only disclosed last year after the deal was announced. The revised agreement, now valued at $4.48 billion, paves the way for the deal to proceed to a shareholder vote as early as April, although securities regulators are still assessing how Yahoo disclosed information about the breaches to investors. Yahoo, which is winding down its own investigation of the breaches, will share more details about the incidents and their impact in the next few weeks when it makes required regulatory filings. Yahoo reiterated on Tuesday that it still expected the deal, originally struck last July, to close by the end of June. The outlines of the new agreement were reported last week. Consummation of the sale to Verizon would bring closure to a saga that has stretched on for nearly three years as Yahoo’s board and its chief executive, Marissa Mayer, considered various plans to separate the company’s fading internet businesses from its much more valuable investment stakes in Alibaba, China’s largest e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, an affiliated company controlled by SoftBank Group. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Yahoo still faces dozens of lawsuits related to the theft of its user data. Hackers stole information, including weakly encrypted passwords, on one billion user accounts in 2013, later selling the information online . The following year, another set of hackers, which Yahoo believes were sponsored by a foreign government, stole similar information on more than 500 million accounts . The two breaches, the largest known hacks of a private corporation, came amid infighting at Yahoo over security investments and safety measures that would inconvenience users. Yahoo has argued that disclosure of the breaches had little effect on use of its services. In a securities filing on Tuesday, the company provided charts indicating that after the larger breach was disclosed in December, the number of pages viewed on its core sites like news and sports fell compared with the previous year. However, other measures like overall page views and the number of email messages sent and received showed no significant drop. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
