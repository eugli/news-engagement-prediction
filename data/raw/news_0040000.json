He talks about studying sacred Islamic texts in the ‘sham’ (a historical name for Greater Syria) and choosing to carry out a suicide mission for the terror group.\n“When we were in Sinjar, we worshipped the devil and we were without God… We were ignorant and not aware of concepts such as Halal and Haram,” he says looking into the camera.\nA family source told The Foreign Desk the two brothers are 11 and 12.\nThey were kidnapped when the Islamic State stormed the predominantly Yazidi town of Sinjar in August 2014, killing as many as 5000 Yazidi men in what has since become known as the Sinjar Massacre.\nThe father of the boys, along with four additional siblings, were also killed during the vicious massacre.\nClick for more from The Foreign Desk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:10:33.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
