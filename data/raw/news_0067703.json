Whether you respect the person who holds that position or not, you respect the office that he holds. This wasn't an endorsement nor a political statement of any kind. It was, quite simply, a round of golf. Golf was our common ground, nothing else.\"\n\"I've travelled all over the world and have been fortunate enough to befriend people from many different countries, beliefs and cultures. To be called a fascist and a bigot by some people because I spent time in someone's company is just ridiculous,\" McIlroy added. \"I hope, to some degree, this clarifies my decision to accept the invitation that was extended to me.\"\npic.twitter.com/T4N0cFyoaY â€” Rory McIlroy (@McIlroyRory) February 24, 2017 \nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from   news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

The 27-year-old member of both the European and PGA Tours played golf over the weekend with Trump and former MLB player Paul O'Neill. The White House had initially said Trump played a \"few holes\" of golf, but corrected itself later after McIlroy wrote that they had played 18 holes.\nMcIlroy lives in Ireland, but also has a residence in Palm Beach, which could be one reason the administration reached out to him as a golf partner for Trump.\n\"He probably shot around 80. He's a decent player for a guy in his 70s,\" McIlroy said about Trump.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:37:23.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
