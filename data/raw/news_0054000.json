Here's a guide about where to start in order to choose the right facial for your skin. Basic Is Best \nWhen in doubt choose the most basic facial on the spa menu. Traditional facials pretty much follow the same steps which include thorough cleansing, skin analysis, exfoliation, extractions (if needed), massage, and a mask. The products used during a basic facial can be customized for all skin types and conditions. Estheticians are trained to know how to treat all different skin conditions and to know which ingredients are ok or not ok to use depending on what is going on with someone's skin. If your skin doesn't have any specific and pressing skin issues you will get great results from a basic facial. Even if you aren't sure which type of facial is right for you and you choose the most basic facial on the spa menu you can usually change your choice before beginning if your esthetician recommends another type of facial instead. Acne Facials \nIf you have acne or a lot of blackheads that you need removed look for facials that have the words \"purifying\", \"clarifying\", \"detoxifying\", and \"deep cleansing\" in the name or the explanation about the facial. While the steps in an anti-acne facial might not vary too much from the ones in a basic facial the products used in this type of facial will be suited for oily, acne prone skin such as a cleanser with salicylic acid or a mask with sulfur or clay. Anti-acne facials are a great way to help control breakouts and deal with pesky blackheads but may be too harsh for those with sensitive or dry skin. Anti-Aging Facials \nFacials are a great way to give your skin an anti-aging push. Besides for the words \"anti-aging\" in the name of the treatment or the description also look for words such as \"lifting\", \"rejuvenating\", or \"revitalizing\". These facials generally include the use of alpha hydroxy acids such as glycolic or lactic acid to exfoliate the skin and may include serums with peptides or various vitamins which help build collagen. A facial that is meant to have anti-aging benefits may include the use of technologies like microcurrent or LED lights . All of these anti-aging products and technologies doesn't mean that the facial can't be pampering as well. Since massage is a great way to destress and stress ages us this type of massage should include lots of massage as well. If you are short on time getting a chemical peel can be a great way to get anti-aging benefits to your skin quickly. Express Facials \nIf you are pressed for time or just have trouble committing to a longer treatment an express facial is right for you. These facials last about 20 or 30 minutes so you can even go get one on your lunch break and come back to the office with glowing skin. Meant to give maximum results in a limited amount of time these treatments can also include a hand massage so they are still indulgent even though they are fast. Facial Add-Ons \nA lot of the time when you get a facial your esthetician may ask you if you want an \"add on\" . That's spa speak for mini treatments like a soothing eye treatment or a foot massage or perhaps a special mask. Don't feel pressured to agree to an add-on if you don't want to. Also make sure you know the price before you agree. Be sure to ask.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:33:33.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
