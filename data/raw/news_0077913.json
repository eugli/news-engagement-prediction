Holding back the tears, the Hollywood star paid a heartfelt tribute to Bill Paxton , who passed away just hours before the ceremony. \"Whether a Prince leading the musical revolution, or a princess leading a rebellion in a galaxy far far away,\" she began - an obvious nod to Prince and Carrie Fisher . \"Everyone was a cherished member of our Hollywood family... as was beloved friend and actor who left us just yesterday, Bill Paxton.\" \nTaking a moment to compose herself, the 48-year-old then went on to add: \"Let us remember their lives and their beautiful work. All were loved, and all will be missed.\" Sara Bareilles performed a beautiful rendition of Joni Mitchell 's Both Sides during the emotional segment, which paid tribute to Mary Tyler Moore , Gene Wilder , John Hurt , Anton Yelchin , Zsa Zsa Gabor and Debbie Reynolds .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:13:07.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
