Henry is described as 'merky', which Parlour says means 'he could roast teams like a turkey'. Vieira, meanwhile, 'put the fear in' to opposition midfielders, but is credited not just for being a 'hard thing' but also for having a 'pengting' game. Parlour also refers to the Invicibles, who went the entire 2003-04 season unbeaten, as 'undefeated mandem'. Stormzy, who released a video with Paul Pogba when the Frenchman joined Manchester United, seemed impressed with the former Arsenal midfielder, nodding along with Parlour as he rapped and then giving a glowing assessment. Stormzy previously joined forces with Paul Pogba to release the United star's comeback song The track is about Arsenal's unbeaten 2003-04 side, featuring Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira Henry is described as 'merky', while Vieira is called 'a skengman' in the song 'I can't believe it, that was incredible man,' he said. 'That was really good. Ray-Pizzee live, you're coming into the game, that's your debut there. 'It was really good, the Henry reference at all. Ray-Pizzee man.' After getting some feedback Parlour, who spent 12 years as an Arsenal player winning three league titles and four FA Cups, admitted he didn't really have a clue what he was saying. Fortunately for Ray-Pizzee, Sportsmail has reproduced his lyrics and offered a simple translation. RAY-PIZZEE'S LYRICS...
