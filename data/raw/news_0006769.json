And the Red Cross is already offering relief to individuals impacted by Trump’s executive order on Friday , which implemented a 120-day ban on all refugees trying to enter the United States and a temporary ban on individuals from seven majority-Muslim countries. The order also indefinitely bans all refugees from Syria. \nMar-A-Lago — President Trump’s well-manicured, palm tree-lined resort on Florida’s southeast coast — has long hosted the international relief group’s charity ball, with little controversy.\nElizabeth Penniman, the group’s vice president of communications, said this year’s event was booked “many, many months” in advance. She declined to comment on whether the Red Cross, which is not a political organization, would still have selected Trump’s private club knowing he would be president.\nThen president-elect Donald Trump talks to members of the media after a meeting with military leadership at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., on Dec. 21. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) “We are grateful to all those attending this event and appreciate their generous donations which will help those affected by disasters, supply much-needed blood to patients and hospitals, teach life-saving skills, support our military and their families, and provide international humanitarian aid,” Penniman said in an email statement. “President Donald J. Trump has attended the International Red Cross Ball in the past, and we appreciate his support for our work.”\nA Facebook page for the protest , which calls itself the “March to Mar-A-Lago for Humanity,” already has more than 1,000 people who say they plan to attend, as well as nearly 4,000 who say they are interested in attending. \nThe protest’s Facebook page says organizers have planned the march because they believe the aid organization’s choice of venue — a Trump-owned property — contradicts the Red Cross’s mission of alleviating human suffering.\n“The Muslim ban, moratorium on accepting Syrian refugees, immigrant deportation policy, stance on reproductive rights, etc. will cause AVOIDABLE suffering around the world,” reads the Facebook post, which also suggests that the Trump administration will marginalize women, minorities, immigrants, Muslims, Jews, and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. \nThe charity ball will feature fireworks, and the protest urges demonstrators to bring glow sticks and flashlights, among other luminescent gadgets. “We want to shine so bright, we will be seen from afar and from above,” reads the Facebook post. \nIt remains unclear, however, if Trump himself will attend the party; a White House spokeswoman did not respond to requests about Trump’s specific schedule this weekend. \nThe gala, where more than 500 guest are anticipated, will mark the Red Cross’s 60th annual charity ball. Penniman noted that Marjorie Merriweather Post hosted the original event at Mar-A-Lago, which was then her private property, and the charity ball usually finds a home either there or at The Breakers — the two largest venues in Palm Beach.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:14:36.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
