Picture: Stefan Postles/Getty Images Staff writers News Corp Australia Network Share Share on Twitter \nAS Donald Trump tries to smooth things over with Malcolm Turnbull, after their explosive phone call, his press secretary Sean Spicer can’t seem to get the PM’s name right. \nMr Spicer slipped up in his news briefing calling Malcolm Turnbull, Mr Trumble, like he did a day earlier. \n“They did have a very productive and engaging meeting. We have a tremendous amount of respect for the people of Australia, for Prime Minister Trumble (sic) ... we are going to continue to work through this. We are going to honour the commitments that were made in same way meaning we are going to continue vet these people in accordance with the agreement that was made.” \nMORE: Trump tough on visas, softens on Turnbull Malcolm Turnbull’s name is proving a tongue twister for White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Picture: AFP/ Brendan Smialowski Source: AFP \nMr Spicer also made a mistake when he said that Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon had met with the “prime minister”, before being corrected by the media who told him they had met with Joe Hockey. But this isn’t the first time Mr Spicer has mispronounced Turnbull’s name. Speaking at a White House briefing a day earlier about the contested refugee deal, Mr Spicer made numerous references to a mysterious “Mr Trumble” as he confirmed it would be going ahead.
