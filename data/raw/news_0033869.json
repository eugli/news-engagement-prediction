Johnson & Johnson has joined supermarket Waitrose in announcing a switch from plastic to paper. Group marketing manager Niamh Finan said: ‘We recognise that our products have an environmental footprint, and that’s why we’re working hard to continually improve and champion best practice in sustainability, in line with our company’ s founding principles.’ Cotton buds are the number one item of plastic, sewage-related debris on beaches and in rivers. Stock image A spokesman for the company added: ‘Johnson & Johnson Ltd is actively transitioning to paper sticks in our cotton buds.’ Companies under pressure over the ‘plastic poison’ polluting British beaches have already agreed in some cases to ban plastic microbeads from toothpaste, face scrubs and abrasive cleaners. Dr Sue Kinsey, senior pollution policy officer at the Marine Conservation Society, said: ‘The amount of cotton bud sticks our volunteer beach cleaners have found on UK beaches have doubled since 2012 from an average of 11 to 24 for every 100 metres of beach cleaned. ‘So we’re delighted that Johnson & Johnson have listened to consumer concerns and have changed from plastic to paper for their cotton bud sticks. This will certainly decrease the amount of plastic reaching our seas.’ Scottish environmentalist group Fidra have been calling for companies to switch to paper stems since 2013 and research officer Dr Clare Cavers said: ‘We commend Johnson & Johnson for leading this change in product material - it is an important part of the solution to the growing problem of plastic pollution in our seas. ‘A step change in consumer behaviour is needed to ensure people dispose of waste responsibly and only flush toilet paper.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:49:07.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
