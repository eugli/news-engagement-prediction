Wall Street thinks the party is about to end. by Pondering who to blame if things go south. By Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images. For investors willing to ignore the wall-building, deportations, and travel bans—not to mention the erratic tweeting— Donald Trump has been a godsend. After eight years of restrictive, level-headed, technocratic governance under Barack Obama , the Trump presidency promised to throw caution to the wind, gut financial and environmental regulations, slash taxes, and let the animal spirits loose to stampede across the economic landscape with wild abandon. But after a chaotic first month in office, during which President Trump derailed any progress on tax reform with a series of near-daily scandals, some market prognosticators are taking a second look into their crystal balls and not liking what they see . Goldman Sachs said this week that there’s a clear “cognitive dissonance” going on in the market between what people want Trump to do and what he will probably do, or, rather, not do. Tax reform, for example, is reportedly “on life support” and there’s only so much Paul Ryan will be able to do to keep the dream alive, Weekend at Bernie’s –style. And financial stocks— the darlings of the Trump rally—have equity analysts very worried. Per Bloomberg : \nAmong stocks from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Citigroup Inc., downgrades have outnumbered upgrades by a margin of almost 2-to-1 since the election, according to analyst recommendations compiled by Bloomberg data. That’s a deterioration from the previous three months, when the downgrade-upgrade ratio sat at 1.5. \nThe caution goes against a phalanx of investors who are betting the bank rally will last. Since Trump’s election, almost $10 billion of fresh money has flown to exchange-traded funds that buy financial shares, the most among 12 sectors tracked by Bloomberg. All of which suggests that the Trump bulls, while still riding high, should be worried by the growing number of Trump bears. Last month, Citigroup banking analyst Keith Horowitz told clients to sell Goldman, in addition to cutting his rating on Comerica Bank. Axios, for its part, notes that failure by Team Trump to come through on its business-first initiatives will likely doom the rally, putting an end to a streak that has made everyone, but especially investors in Goldman Sachs , very happy. “Investors are paying more today for a dollar of earnings than at any point during the lead up to the financial crisis,” according to the Shiller P.E. ratio, which compares current stock prices with a 10-year average of corporate earnings. If their big gamble on Trump doesn’t pay off, you can bet the market rally is in trouble.
