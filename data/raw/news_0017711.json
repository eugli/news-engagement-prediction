Eman Ali (right) embraces her sister at SFO on Sunday. (CBS) \nEman and her father had been stuck in the east African nation of Dijbouti since Monday, when authorities refused to let his 12-year-old daughter, Eman, board a plane with him to the United States because she is from Yemen. \nThe Middle Eastern nation is one of the seven predominantly Muslim nations listed in Trump’s order. That order was halted by a federal judge in Seattle on Friday. \nHer father says he’s happy to be home with all his family and adds “it’s the best feeling.” \nTM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
