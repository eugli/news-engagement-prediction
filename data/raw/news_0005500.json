He joined the Border Patrol more than 30 years ago and served as deputy chief in the administration of President Barack Obama. \nBrandon Judd, the union president, said in a recent interview that Morgan never had the support of agents. \n“(Vitiello) and I do not see eye to eye on a great, great many things but we were always able to keep it respectful, always,” Judd said. “Morgan and I have not been able to do that.” \nThe appointment is not subject to Senate confirmation. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:49:42.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
