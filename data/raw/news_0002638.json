The White House also vowed to defend \"international territories\" in the strategic waterway. \n\nBut how the United States would achieve that has been unclear, including whether it would have a military dimension. \n\nAnalysts have said Tillerson's remarks, like those from the White House, suggested the possibility of US military action, or even a naval blockade. \n\nSuch action would risk an armed confrontation with China, an increasingly formidable nuclear-armed military power. It is also the world's second-largest economy and the prime target of Trump accusations of stealing American jobs. \n\nMattis suggested that major military action was not being currently considered. \n\n\"What we have to do is exhaust all efforts, diplomatic efforts, to try to resolve this properly, maintaining open lines of communication,\" Mattis said, in his most complete remarks on the issue to date. \n\n\"And certainly our military stance should be one that reinforces our diplomats in this regard. But there is no need right now at this time for military maneuvers or something like that, that would solve something that's best solved by the diplomats.\" \n\nChina claims most of the South China Sea, while Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam , the Philippines and Brunei claim parts of the waters that command strategic sea lanes and have rich fishing grounds along with oil and gas deposits. \n\nMattis criticized China's actions. \n\n\"China has shredded the trust of nations in the region, apparently trying to have a veto authority over the diplomatic and security and economic conditions of neighboring states,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T15:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:37:54.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
