Australian rugby union great Phil Waugh pays tribute to Vickerman \nHis Test debut for Australia came in 2002 and, after playing in a second World Cup in 2007, he moved to England and spent three years earning a degree in land economics at Cambridge University. \nDuring that time, Vickerman played in two Varsity matches and also had a short stint with Northampton. \nHe returned to Australia to continue his career with the Waratahs and also forced his way back into Australia's side, securing a place in their 2011 World Cup party. \nVickerman made his final international appearance in the semi-final of that tournament and was forced to retire in 2012 after persistent problems with stress fractures in his right leg. Vickerman won 63 caps for the Wallabies between 2002 and 2011 \nAustralia Rugby Union chief executive Bill Pulver said: \"The rugby world is in shock today after news of the tragic passing of Dan Vickerman. \n\"Dan was an uncompromising competitor who forged a wonderful international rugby career despite a number of injury setbacks along the way. \n\"A much-loved character off the field. He cared deeply about the game and the players, helping players transition into life after rugby in his role with (the players association) RUPA following his retirement. Vickerman spent the majority of his club career with the Waratahs \n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with Dan's family at this extremely difficult time.\" \nEngland coach Eddie Jones, who coached Australia and the Brumbies, said: \"On behalf of the RFU and myself, I would like to send my condolences to Dan Vickerman's family, Sarah and the two kids. He was a wonderfully committed team player and a good guy. He will be sorely missed by the rugby community.\" \nFurther tributes poured in for Vickerman with former team-mate, and close friend, Phil Waugh saying: \"We all have huge admiration for the guy that he was. \n\"He's a guy that necessarily wasn't the loudest in the team, but had the most respect from everyone playing with him. There's so many positive memories of him on and off the field.\" \nAnother former Wallaby, Matt Burke added: \"Very abrasive as a player but a great lad, great tourist, a very good player and was just one of the good lads that you enjoyed his company.\" Rest in Peace, Dan Vickerman. 63 Tests, three Rugby World Cups, infinite respect. https://t.co/9Vl33SrQGN pic.twitter.com/mTfur3GeTi — Qantas Wallabies (@qantaswallabies) February 19, 2017 Saddened to learn of the devastating news of Dan Vickerman.
