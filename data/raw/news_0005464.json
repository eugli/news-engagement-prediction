Photo: Penny Stephens \n\"In light of this, we are applying to the Fair Work Commission to legally end the operation of the existing collective agreement. We are communicating closely with our employees about this process.\" An investigation by Fairfax Media last year revealed that several fast food outlets and supermarkets were using agreements that would, if challenged, not pass the better off overall test. The better off overall test means that all agreements have to ensure that all staff members covered by the agreement are not worse off than they would be if they were paid under the award. On Tuesday, the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union applied on behalf of its members to the Fair Work Commission to terminate another expired agreement used by the company that was struck in 2011. That agreement covers about 400 staff across 16 stores in Victoria. Analysis by the union shows more than 80 per cent of retail staff are losing on average almost $1000 per annum â€“ with some being paid more than $2000 less each year than the minimum wages in the General Retail Industry Award 2010. \nAccording to the union, all but one of the sales assistants are below 21 and more than half are under 18 years of age.
