That won’t be the case with the Demon, as it will be the first production vehicle offered from the factory with a suspension optimized for drag racing. With this specific tuning, the Demon is designed to be “highly competent in all drive modes and configurations” but is intended to “absolutely dominate in Drag Mode.” Dodge says more details on that Drag Mode will arrive in the coming weeks. \nThe SRT Demon’s suspension was designed to “deliver maximum launch force while maintaining directional control,” unlike past drag setups that offered good performance on the strip but poor handling anywhere else. This is achieved in part with electronically controlled Bilstein adaptive dampers, which can help optimize weight transfer for traction. The Demon’s software can adjust the shocks’ rebound and compression from firm to soft to shift weight to the rear at launch, and can also disable traction control without losing electronic stability control. \nIn addition, Dodge gave the Demon 35-percent lower-rate front springs, 29-percent lower-rate rear springs, a 75-percent lower-rate hollow front anti-roll bar, and a 44-percent lower-rate rear anti-roll bar. Those goodies combined with the Demon’s exclusive 315-width Nitto NT05R drag radials , reduced weight , and new Air Grabber cold air intake system should make the Demon a force to be reckoned with at the drag strip. \nLastly, Dodge leaves us yet another vague sequence of numbers that likely hints at the Demon’s performance. This time, we’re given “13.5=575@500.” What could that mean? Your guess is as good as ours. We’ll have to wait until the car debuts at the New York auto show next month to find out. \nCheck out the latest teaser video at www.ifyouknowyouknow.com .
