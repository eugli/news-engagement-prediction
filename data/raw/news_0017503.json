Everyone in the railway is working together to make this plan a success.”\nA pilot scheme to overhaul Britain’s rail fares was announced last week to make it easier for passengers to buy the cheapest tickets. \nThe scheme will abolish some fares for long, connecting journeys in favour of cheaper alternatives, introduce single leg pricing for some journeys to inform passengers of whether or not they would be better off buying two single tickets or a return, and make ticket vending machines more user-friendly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:12:50.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
