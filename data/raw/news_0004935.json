Even the home coffee machine isn't exempt. \nThe Horowhenua District Council issued the notice on Friday night, following heavy rain on Thursday. \nThe water plant was struggling to meet demand and manage the treatment of muddy water from the Ohau River, it read. \nUntil further notice, residents connected to the Levin water supply were advised to boil water before using it for: \n* Drinking (including making of sachet juice/drinks) * Making ice * Brushing teeth * Preparing infant/toddler formula. \nElectric jugs with a cut-off switch could be used as long as they were full and the water allowed to come to the boil and switch off automatically. It was not advised to hold the switch down to increase the boiling time. \nWater can also be placed a clean metal pan and brought to a rolling boil for one minute. \nBoiled water should be covered and allowed to cool in the same container. \nResidents were also asked to reduce their water use wherever possible to help the treatment plant cope better. \nPeople with severely compromised immune systems, babies, pregnant women, and some elderly may be at increased risk and should seek advice from health care providers before drinking the water. \nAnyone with specific health concerns should consult a doctor or Healthline 0800 611 116. \nFood businesses were asked to ensure staff were using hand sanitiser after washing their hands, use commercially made ice, use bottled water for post-mix soft drink machines and ensure coffee machines were boiling water to 100 degrees. Once the notice was lifted, businesses would need to ensure they flushed, cleaned and sanitised all equipment with water line connections. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T11:21:29.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
