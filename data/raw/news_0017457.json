They are native to the Mary and Burnett rivers in Queensland. \nThey have a single primitive lung and are among a small number of fish that can breathe air. \nThey have existed for nearly 400 million years and fossils show they have remained unchanged for more than 100 million years. \nABC/AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:42:30.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
