The post written by an executive at Capitol One, Jake Fuentes, made the case that Trump's executive order , and the chaos around it, are intentionally orchestrated by Steve Bannon and others within the Trump administration. In the piece, \"The Immigration Ban is a Headfake, and We’re Falling For It,\" Fuentes explained, they are doing so in an attempt to use the pandemonium to consolidate power, distract from other actions, and, once the most egregious parts of it (stopping green-card holders, citizens of American allies, and US citizens from entering) are stopped, leave in place an order that still bans refugees and visa admittance from these countries. \nThe logic goes like this: the administration is seeing how far they can push the system of checks and balances by seeing what kind of overreach they can get away with, keeping track of which people in the government ( like Customs and Border Patrol ) they can count on, and which they can't (such as Sally Yates, the former acting Attorney General ). \"The administration is deliberately testing the limits of governmental checks and balances to set up a self-serving, dangerous consolidation of power,\" Fuentes wrote. Trump and his advisers are simultaneously making moves behind the scenes, such as rearranging the National Security Council to remove the normal military and intelligence officials and replace them with Bannon. And they are desensitizing the country to marches and protests, over an issue they can easily back down upon while still achieving 80 percent of their goals. \nThis is not the only piece like this floating around. Yonatan Zunger, an engineer on the privacy team at Google, published his own Medium piece the day before entitled \"Trial Balloon For A Coup\" focusing on how the Trump administration seems to be using this chaos to consolidate power as well as engage in some kleptocratic tendencies. David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, published his version of Trump's authoritarian playbook as well in The Atlantic . There are folks on here who, if Trump launched a nuclear first strike, would say it's merely a diversion from something Bannon did at the WH Source: Alex Burns on Twitter \nIt's understandable that many who oppose Trump to see the events of the past weekend as something even more sinister than what they seem to be. Throughout the presidential campaign, Trump kept doing things that seemed crazy — announcing the Muslim ban , bringing Bill Clinton's accusers to the debate , asking Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails — and kept rebounding. As we all well know, he even won the election despite them. It's obvious that many Democrats and other Trump opponents assume he must be planning everything in a game of Machiavellian 8-dimensional chess — if only so that they don't feel stupid losing to him. tech founder dudes keep writing Medium posts speculating 3D chess games DT administration play because they cling to the idea of meritocracy ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:48:14.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
