It was Donald's. Truthfully, it's a lot to cope with.\" \nTo think she's not even living in the White House with the former reality TV star so their 10-year-old son Barron can finish school in New York and it's still overwhelming for her. \nPhillip went on, adding that Melania is keeping out of the spotlight while in the Big Apple and \"is staying hidden more.\" \nThat includes not leaving her multi-million dollar apartment to escort their son to school like she used to. An insider spilled: \n\"Melania has the Secret Service take Barron to school and retrieve him.\" \nAnother source even went as far as to claim the former model \"is unhappy with how her life ended up. She is miserable.\" \nYikes! And it's being said Donnie's wife feels more at home in Florida: \n\"Melania says she's most happy at Mar-a-Lago. She loves Palm Beach!\" \nWhile she certainly looked happy hosting the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie in Delray Beach, sources tell a different story: \n\"Don't let her smile in those photos fool you. She hates this.\" \nConsidering her lack of enthusiasm towards her new role, we're not too surprised! \nOf course, a confidante close to Barron's momma disagrees, claiming \"she is very happy with her life and supporting her husband and family.\" \nFor her sake, we certainly hope she's \"very happy\"!! \nThoughts??", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T20:49:32.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
