This spell would smash the existing record of six consecutive days over 45 degrees from 2014 and 2004. Overnight minimums during this time should remain above 30 degrees, beating the 2012 record of six in a row. Birdsville's hottest day on record was 49.5 degrees on 24th January 1972.Thargomindah's run of days above 44 degrees could reach 10 by Friday next week, including a few days at 46 degrees.

This would take their run of days over 40 degrees to 12 by Thursday and it should to reach 15 next weekend. The current record of 18 days from 1884 could certainly be challenged this month.Bourke has exceeded 40 degrees for the last six days in a row and will extend this tally to 16 by next weekend.

This will be an unprecedented run of hot days for the town, which has data available back to 1972.The exceptionally hot start to 2017 in parts of New South Wales and Queensland is being caused by abnormally high pressure to the east of Australia. This setup is causing less cloud and more frequent northerly winds over Australia eastern inland, which is producing a stagnant pool of very hot air. - Weatherzone", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:27:36.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
