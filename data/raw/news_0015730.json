To share women's stories and celebrate women's vital roles in the past, present and future of our country. Despite all the challenges we face, I remain convinced that yes, the future is female. Just look at the amazing energy we saw last month as women organized a march that galvanized millions of people all over our country and across the world. Now more than ever, we need to stay focused on the theme of this year's conference. Be bold. We need strong women to step up and speak out. We need you to dare greatly and lead boldly. So please, set an example for every woman and girl out there who's worried about what the future holds, and wonders whether our rights, opportunities and values will endure. And remember, you are the heroes and history makers. The glass ceiling breakers of the future. As I've said before, I'll say again. Never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world. So thank you makers. \" Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T18:04:20.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
