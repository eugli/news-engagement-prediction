He even joked that paintball guns may be needed. \nBarkley called into ESPN Chicago 1000's Waddle & Silvy show on Tuesday to sound off on the feud that has taken the NBA world by storm the past 24 hours. He said that he wouldn't get personal like James had done. Charles Barkley on ESPN Radio right now, calls LeBron \"whiny\" again but says he is not going to \"get personal\" the way he says LeBron did. — Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) January 31, 2017 \nIn James' rant, he listed off less-than-favorable moments from Barkley's career. Barkley had a response for that too. Well, after he was reminded what Google is. \"Clearly he Googled me and found out some things\"(tho first Barkley asked 'what's it called when you go on the internet & look things up?') — Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) January 31, 2017 \nBarkley brushed away the notion that he has to be friends with James. He said that will never happen. Barkley: \"This notion that we have to be friends - we're never going to be friends.\"Says the young generation \"always takes it personally.\" — Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) January 31, 2017 Barkley asked on ESPN's @WaddleandSilvy show about sitting down w/LeBron \"Why I got to clear the air? It's not going to change my opinion.\" — Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) January 31, 2017 Charles Barkley adds that LeBron forgot a few insults about him, like that he finished last on Jeopardy. — Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) January 31, 2017 (Barkley his golf buddies have been telling him that they're going to give LeBron suggestions on other insults he could use.) — Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) January 31, 2017 \nI don't know what it will solve, but a paintball fight between Barkley and LeBron would be must-see TV. Charles Barkley now suggesting to @WaddleandSilvy that he and LeBron should go at each other with paintball guns as an event at All-Star. — Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) January 31, 2017 \nWe will update the story as the interview's full audio becomes available.
