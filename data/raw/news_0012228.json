By Aaron Poole/Courtesy of A.M.P.A.S. More than 160 of this year’s Oscar nominees gathered for a class photo and pep talk Monday at the Beverly Hilton, among them Denzel Washington , Ryan Gosling , Isabelle Huppert , Mel Gibson , and Viola Davis . But it was the empty seats at the event that inspired Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs’s most pointed comments, a reference to Donald Trump’s visa ban keeping nominees like Iranian director Asghar Farhadi home from the festivities. “There are some empty chairs in this room,” Boone Isaacs said to the ballroom of nominees. “There is a struggle globally today over artistic freedom that feels more urgent than at any time since the 1950s. Art has no borders. Art has no language and doesn’t belong to a single faith.” Despite the serious tone of Boone Isaacs’ comments, a spirit of levity prevailed at the event, a low-pressure luncheon where stars and anonymous craftsmen basked in the shared glow of an Oscar nomination. Lin-Manuel Miranda , who flew in from the London set of Mary Poppins Returns to celebrate his original song nomination for Moana , bought his mother to meet Washington. “My work here is done,” Miranda said, after arranging their photo. Hidden Figures star Octavia Spencer reached out and nearly grabbed Moonlight screenwriter Tarell Alvin McCraney’s butt. “Oops, I thought you were somebody else,” Spencer said. And Academy governor Steven Spielberg exclaimed, “Hey, I’ve got a good table this year!” to La La Land producer Marc Platt . Mel Gibson , whose ninth child was born the week he received a directing nomination for Hacksaw Ridge , shared a picture of his newborn on his iPhone. “He looks like Jack Benny,” Gibson said. “Two little golden boys at once.” Asked how this awards season feels different than the one where he won directing and best picture for Braveheart , Gibson noted the emergence of Oscar campaigning: “I guess people spend more money on this now.\" First-time Oscar telecast producers Mike De Luca and Jennifer Todd kept their directions to the nominees light and breezy. De Luca and Todd didn’t tell the room whether or not they ought to get political in their Oscar night speeches, instead delivering some tips via a stylized, black-and-white video starring Kate McKinnon as fictional silent film star Gloria Concave, a cautionary tale who is constantly committing Oscar night gaffes. When Gloria goes over the 45-second time limit in her speech, the audience in the video starts flinging food at her. “I was pelted with cured meats by some Italians!” she warned the nominees. When the nominees took their spots on a set of risers at the end of the event for the traditional group photo, the picture looked different than it has in most previous years, thanks to a historically racially inclusive group of nominees across a range of categories this year. Boone Isaacs had acknowledged the diversity controversy that roiled last year’s Oscars in her opening comments. “Wow, what a difference a year makes,” the Academy president said. “Real progress has been made.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:46:16.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
