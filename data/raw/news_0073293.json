The hotel’s magnificent Quaich bar boasts 1,000 bottles of single malt – the second largest whisky collection in the world. The hotel’s magnificent Quaich bar boasts 1,000 bottles of single malt – the second largest whisky collection in the world What’s more, Piers has his very own blend of Speyside single malts, called Copper Dog. Despite its A-list clientele, Craigellachie does not feel like a swanky celebrity haunt, but more like a cosy pub with rooms – albeit rooms designed to the highest spec by Piers’s wife, Sophie, with leather furniture from Soane mixed with antiques and lashings of cashmere. Party host: Model Kate Moss ‘The Italians have a wonderful saying that some buildings have warm ghosts, and I felt that when I first walked in here,’ Piers tells me over a plate of scrumptious Spey smoked salmon. The food – Aberdeen steak is also a must – is all locally sourced, with input on the menu from Piers’s chum, Mail on Sunday food columnist Tom Parker Bowles. Many of Scotland’s famous exports are on the doorstep, including Johnstons of Elgin, the cashmere purveyors which supplies Vivienne Westwood and Burberry. A glorious 45-minute yomp along the Spey (the hotel will lend you wellies) brings you to the village of Abelour and the original Walkers bakery, where you can stock up on the famed red tartan boxes of shortbread. Piers’s love of the Highlands stems from his late father, David. ‘He was evacuated here during the war,’ he tells me. ‘Before he died, I took him to revisit all the places where he stayed. I fell in love with Craigellachie, so it felt fitting to buy it.’ TRAVEL FACTS British Airways ( ba.com ) offers daily flights to Aberdeen. Double rooms at The Craigellachie in March and April start at £135 for bed and breakfast ( craigellachie hotel.co.uk ).
