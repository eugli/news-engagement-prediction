Nathan Frandino   \nYou can call it the March of the English Bulldogs... And they're marching through the heart of Mexico City, hoping to set a world record. (SOUNDBITE) (Spanish) EVENT ORGANIZER, ERICK HERNANDEZ, SAYING: \"We had more than 951 attendees here at the Monument of the Revolution with their dogs. The requirement for the Guinness Record was that they be English Bulldogs, older than one year, and that's what we did.\" These canines came from across the country, leading their owners by the leash. And demanding a water break for a brief cooldown. Together the owners doled out their puppy love for man and woman's best friends. (SOUNDBITE) (Spanish) BULLDOG OWNER, ANA BELEN NORIEGA, SAYING: \"It's an incredible breed. A lot of people think they are aggressive but it is a very noble and tender breed.\" Data from the event will be sent to the Guinness organization for official certification of the record, but for now it looks like they've had and enjoyed their day in the sun.  //reut.rs/2lJXBLU", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T04:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:12:18.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
