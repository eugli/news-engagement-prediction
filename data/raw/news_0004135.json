Jenn Prine Cincinnati-based intimacy products retailer Pure Romance is launching a new luxury line. Pure Romance is launching its Euforia line of products at an event in Covington on Wednesday evening. CEO Chris Cicchinelli said it's something he and his mother, founder Patty Brisben , had been planning for the last five years. Chris Cicchinelli is CEO of Pure Romance Inc. Jenn Prine \"It's always been my mom's mission to take women on a journey of the different stages of their lives, from figuring out themselves to their first relationship to marriage to children to empty nesters,\" he told me. \"All through those stages there are different products at different prices. Nobody starts out driving the most expensive cars.\" The Euforia line includes many of the same categories customers have come to expect from Pure Romance including intimacy products, lotions and lubricants but also new items like jewelry, fragrance and sleepwear. \"It's a new take, not on lingerie, but on actual sleepwear that you'd find at a high-end retailer like Agent Provocateur,\" Cicchinelli said. The average price point will be around $250 compared to Pure Romance's average price of $160, he said. Pure Romance will be demonstrating something that the company has been increasingly moving toward at the launch party on Wednesday night â€“ streaming the event and product information over the internet. Cicchinelli travels about 250 days a year teaching Pure Romance's product consultants about the products and sales techniques. He said doing it that way, he can reach between 100 and 600 people a day. \"I knew there was a better way out there to do this more efficiently, both for the company and for the learner,\" he said. So he began creating programming on Ustream, a free live-streaming platform. He said that lets learners choose what they want to learn and when. \"None of our shows are canned,\" Cicchinelli said. \"The coolest part is the interaction. People aren't watching a tube, a screen, they can interact with a presenter. We deal with 700 to 3,000 people watching one of our shows.\" Brownfield covers retail and restaurants, technology, manufacturing and courts.
