PHOTO COURTESY: discussions.apple.com/people/Phirsisch \nApparently, the iPhone 7 Plus model seems to be affected more so than the smaller model. Another user claimed that despite the fact that the device was kept in the Apple silicone case, paint chipping was noticed “paint chips even where the case is covering the phone”. PHOTO COURTESY: discussions.apple.com/people/syazwanmnoor \nThis isn’t the first time Apple has seen its device suffering from substandard paint finish. Back in 2012, the Cupertino manufacturer launched the iPhone 5 with a new slate colour that users complained scuffed easily. \niPhone users can now use WhatsApp ‘without Internet’ \nApple subsequently discontinued the slate colour replacing it with space grey. \nThere hasn’t been any official word by Apple in the matter and for now users are resorting DIY solutions to address the issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:28:47.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
