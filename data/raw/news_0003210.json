The university, he said, has a policy against solicitation without permission. \nSMACK DOWN: Chrissy Teigen puts racist photographer on blast on Twitter \nThe group also said it has placed posters at Texas State University in San Marcos and the University of North Texas in Denton. Social media posts indicate that most of the leaflets were distributed over the weekend and early this week. \nTexas State University President Denise Trauth said Monday that her staff was aware of the situation and would investigate. A UNT spokeswoman told local media that the police department opened an investigation. \nNO SHOWS: College professor tweets first day of class disaster \nSeveral of the posters referenced President Donald Trump’s campaign slogans: “What Made America Great? Blood and soil. Keep it that way, join the Vanguard.” \nTexas State University had seen a spate of racist posters on campus after Trump’s election in November. That investigation is ongoing, a spokesman said Wednesday. The University of North Texas got a visit from the American Vanguard tonight.

Not much is known about the couple, but the man recording mentions them being in a black restaurant. As the couple enjoyed a nice meal, another patron of the establishment took exception to their being together. So, he decided to “interview” them using his smart phone. Once the rude man interrupted their date, he just kept on going, chastising the poor guy for dating a white woman, whom he called “the lowest rung of humanity.” Somehow, the black boyfriend showed restraint and simply just laughed the rude customer off, doing his best to calmly de-escalate the situation. The video has since been posted to World Star, where it’s been viewed more than 800,000 times.
