Mysuru may not be the base point for tourists as it was now for visiting Madikeri, Wayanad or Ooty. Tourists will get a new travelling route — fly to Kannur, travel by road to Madikeri, Wayanad and Ooty (via Gudulur),” says B.S. Prashanth, president of the Mysuru Travel Mart. \nMysuru has many tourist attractions but the city still needs something new that can draw tourists in all seasons and encourage them stay for a couple of days. Evenings must have some events for keeping tourists busy and entertained, he said. \nMr. Prashanth, who is part of a group constituted by tourism stakeholders for preparing a vision document for Mysuru, told The Hindu that tourist footfall has dropped by over 40% from last year. The tourism industry, especially the hospitality sector, is bearing the brunt with low occupancy rates like never before. \nAggressive promotion \nStakeholders suggest the hard sell of Mysuru in a new way, adding entertainment and cultural shows and aggressively promoting them in major airports. \nMysuru is a passage for many visiting Madikeri, Ooty and Wayanad. But now tourists from the northern or western parts of the country may as well fly to Kannur instead of Bengaluru, bypassing Mysuru, for visiting these places. While the road journey from Mysuru to Madikeri takes about five hours, that from Kannur to Kodagu takes about an hour, Mr. Prashanth said. \nTherefore, there is an urgent need to bring in more attractions such as 3-D projection mapping (a popular attraction in many foreign cities) that could pull tourists to the city, stakeholders said. \nThey also are hoping for quick resumption of commercial flight operations from Mysuru airport, which has been lying inactive for over a year. \nMysuru’s wish list \nThe Karnataka Pradesh Hotels and Restaurants Association (KPHRA) has sought improvement of existing tourist destinations, particularly Brindavan Gardens at the Krishnaraja Sagar dam site near Mysuru. \nThe association, led by its president M. Rajendra, presented its wish list to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah recently for announcement in the forthcoming State Budget. It has sought early renovation of Brindavan Gardens with a cable car facility for making the spot even more attractive. \nMr. Rajendra urged the CM to hasten tourism development projects in Mysuru, some of which had been proposed in last year’s budget. He also sought cut in entry tax for tourist vehicles in order to boost tourist footfall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:50:52.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
