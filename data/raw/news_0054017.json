By Rebecca Shapiro \nYou’ve probably never seen the national anthem performed like this before. \nArtist Joe Everson did more than sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the University of Arkansas men’s basketball game this week. He painted throughout the entire song, with a very impressive reveal at the end. \nEverson has made headlines for his national anthem displays in the past. In October, Everson showed off his skills ahead of an ECHL hockey game. Fans of the artist can view more of his paintings and photography on his website, which includes a section dedicated to his national anthem performances. \n“With a few lines I can say so much. That’s where art comes to life for me,” Everson says on his website. His original rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” may be the best example of the artist’s philosophy. \nCheck out the performance in the video above.
