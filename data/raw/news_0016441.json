It’s absolutely clear to me. We’ve already shown great patience, but everything has its limits,” he said. \n“It’s the case of Ukraine’s specific choice,” the politician said of Kiev’s attempts to whitewash Bandera and other Ukrainian far-right radicals, who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II. \nBandera was leader of the militant arm of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) during the beginning of World War II, but was later arrested by the Germans and spent years in a concentration camp. \nOUN cooperated with the Nazis, urging the Ukrainian people to aid the invading forces in destroying the Soviet Union. \nAfter being released, Bandera became the leader of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) that was created in 1942, which mostly fought against the Armia Krajowa of Poland and the Red Army in Western Ukraine. \nAccording to Kaczynski, the Ukrainian nationalists “surpassed the Germans in their brutality against the Poles.” \nIt’s estimated that between 76,000 and 106,000 Poles, mainly women and children, were killed in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia during the campaign of ethnic cleansing carried out by Bandera’s UPA in 1943-44. \n“For many years there’s a cult of people who committed genocide against the Polish people,” the former Polish PM said. \nThe 108th anniversary since Bandera’s birth in early January was marked by torch rallies, which went on unhampered by the authorities and gathered thousands of people in Ukrainian capital Kiev and the port city of Odessa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:05:12.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
