So, I'm going to work hard to be ready to go, and I still plan on playing for a long time.\" Brady says his age has only helped him on the field. \"In some ways, being more experienced and having your family life settled does allow you to focus a little bit more, too, because there's less B.S. in your life,\" he explains. \"You know, you have your family and you can go to work and focus on your job.
