The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. \nThere are also more than 95 outposts - settlements built without official authorisation from the Israeli government - across the West Bank. Blame and bitterness keep peace at bay \nLocated on a hilltop near the settlement of Ofra, north-east of Ramallah, Amona was built in 1996 on land registered as privately-owned by Palestinians. \nIn 2006, following a decision by the Israeli Supreme Court, nine permanent structures in the outpost were demolished, sparking violent clashes between settlers and security forces.

But the deadline was recently extended until 8 February. \nThe BBC's Yolande Knell, who is at the outpost, says many of the 50 or so Israeli families who have been living there remained in the homes as bulldozers approached on Wednesday. \n\"We won't leave our homes on our own. Pull us out, and we'll go,\" one settler was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. \"It is a black day for Zionism.\" \nThe settlers were joined by hundreds of supporters, many of whom confronted the lines of Israeli police acting on the Supreme Court's order.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Israel's parliament may soon approve a bill to retroactively legalise other unauthorised outposts \nEducation Minister Naftali Bennett, leader of the Jewish Home party, called the Amona settlers \"heroes\" and said a bill currently before the Israeli parliament that seeks to retroactively legalise other unauthorised outposts would soon be passed. \n\"Thanks to the campaign in Amona, thousands of families will be rescued from being evicted from their homes. I call on the pioneers of our generation, the settlers of Judea and Samaria, to lift up your heads,\" he said, using the Biblical name for the West Bank. \nThe bill is expected to be approved by parliament next week, but it is opposed by Israel's attorney-general and legal experts say it is likely be overturned by the Supreme Court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T17:10:19.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
