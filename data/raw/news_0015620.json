In an earlier interview Thursday the actor confessed that it’s “not a lot of fun” to play the president. \n“I think I enjoy being a part of it. But playing him is not a lot of fun. He’s tense, he’s angry, he’s pissed off — and that’s not always fun to play,” Baldwin explained in an interview on “Extra” with his wife, Hilaria Baldwin. \nBaldwin said he was surprised Trump didn’t change once he won the White House. \n“My God, I keep coming back to the same thing, which is that he won,” he noted. “I thought he would have settled down, and relaxed, and said, ‘Hey man, let’s everybody kind of chill. Let’s focus’ ... The president sets a tone.” \nTrump clearly watches Baldwin’s characterizations of him but pronounces them unfunny. \nAs for digs against him this week by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Baldwin brushed them off in the “Extra” interview. Spicer said at a press conference that “Alec has gone from funny to mean, and that’s unfortunate.” \n“What’s he supposed to say?” said Baldwin when asked about Spicer’s comments. \n“All those guys are working for Trump, they work for the president, the office of the president. They’re going to say what they need to say to, you know, fit in, go along to get along,” he added. \n“That’s I think symbolic of where we’re at, which is we repeat back everything Trump says,” he noted. Baldwin himself is doing the same “weird” thing repeating the president’s words on “SNL,” he added. “Doing this is strange, but what is even more strange is this is real,” he added. But, he said: “ People need to laugh . They are upset.” \nDespite Trump’s frequent tweeted complaints, “SNL” is having its best season in 22 years \nMelissa McCarthy ’s i mpersonation of White House press secretary Sean Spicer last week was a run-away hit, garnering nearly 20 million views on YouTube in less than a week. . @NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017 \n”Saturday Night Live” airs Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET on NBC.
