Photo: Alamy It isn’t an easy task to stand out in New Orleans, a city of over-the-top culture and mass charisma, but pop artist Ashley Longshore emerges from the crowd with her bold art and even bigger personality. Longshore’s work is a fierce paint-storm of bedazzled portraits of Frida Kahlo and Audrey Hepburn and cheeky sayings like “There’s No Crying At Bergdorf’s.” Ashley recently published her book You Don’t Look Fat, You Look Crazy, a fabulous bible of unfiltered advice that preaches hard work alongside personal mantras like “Always Ask For More” and “What Would Blue Ivy Do?” Ashley Longshore’s “You Don’t Look Fat, You Look Crazy” Photo: Paul Costello / Courtesy of Ashley Longshore Ashley’s glitzy artwork caught the eye of Blake Lively, who told us, “I noticed her gallery while driving down the street. I got out of my car to look inside but it was closed. So I sat outside like a kid looking through the gates to Wonka’s factory.” And while Ashley Longshore’s work has been collected by many celebrities, Blake Lively seems to be Ashley’s number one. “There's a playfulness [in Longshore’s work] that resonates with me—a celebration of life that explodes off her canvas. She takes the piss out of the material and trivial with her humor, which I love. But mostly I’m drawn to the powerful women she portrays with such vibrancy and awe,\" Lively professed. Ashley Longshore’s studio in New Orleans Photo: Paul Costello / Courtesy of Ashley Longshore Ashley Longshore calls New Orleans home and from her studio on Magazine Street she told us why: “This city is raw like an uncut diamond. It has so much of this wild and artistic insanity happening around you at any given moment.” Often dismissed as a boozy destination , New Orleans is so much more, with incredible culinary happenings, enchanting scenery, and the general charm that you’d expect from a city founded in 1718. To help navigate through the tourist snares of the Crescent City, Ashley provides us with her favorite haunts in New Orleans: The Caribbean Room at The Pontchartrain Hotel Photo: Courtesy of The Caribbean Room Where to Eat: The Caribbean Room at The Pontchartrain Hotel “The Caribbean room designed by Andrew Alford is by far one of my favorite places to have cocktails and dinner. The atmosphere is like you’re stepping back in time and it is elegant, old-school New Orleans. It’s intimate, the food is incredible, and when you go there once, you’ll have your very own waiter there forever . . . ask for Lawrence, he’s my captain.” Lilette “Lilette is my favorite place to dine on a weeknight. I always ask for the chef’s table, table 51. The food is incredible, the custom cocktails are magnificent, and it’s nestled right in the Garden District and it has that good old New Orleans neighborhood feel. Ask for CH, he is my favorite waiter.” “The private room at Doris Metropolitan is my favorite place to dine in the French Quarter. The outside courtyard is fantastic and when you finish a fantastic meal with friends, you can wander into all sorts of New Orleans madness.” Doris Metropolitan Photo: Courtesy of Doris Metropolitan What to Do: Trixie Minx “When I go out in the the French Quarter, one of my favorite things to see is the Fleur de Tease burlesque show at One Eyed Jack’s . OEJ’s is a beautiful round theatre and the star, Miss Trixie Minx will surely not disappoint. Her troupes of dancers have new shows every month that are creative and whimsical and the dancers are beyond talented.” Ogden Museum “The Ogden Museum is an impeccably curated museum and my favorite museum in New Orleans. It’s in the arts district and right across from the WWII Museum. It has the best selection of Southern artists and the museum shop has a fantastic grouping of artisan finds.” Backstreet Cultural Museum “My most favorite colorful, sparkly, bedazzled parts of New Orleans are the Mardi Gras Indians. Each of their suits is hand-beaded every year and they are the most incredible works of art I’ve ever seen. Visiting the Backstreet Cultural Museum is a must for anyone learning about New Orleans culture.” So SuSu Photo: Courtesy of So SuSu Where to Shop:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:55:24.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
