(CBC)\nSome issues cross income levels In a small sample of 34 residents, he said, 52 percent said they were experiencing moderate food insecurity.\n\"Sometimes even when the finances are there, people don't have the education on how to feed themselves properly, and eating well takes time,\" he said. \"That issue affects different populations regardless of income.\"\nThe survey also covered issues related to housing, and how people use community spaces such as Rainbow Park, Queen Square, and Tin Can Beach, Lutes said.\nThe survey also covered housing issues and how people use community spaces such as Rainbow Park, Queen Square, pictured, and Tin Can Beach. (Julia Wright / CBC)\nPULSE, which stands for People United in the Lower South End, has a mandate to improve the quality of life for people living and working in the neighbourhood.\n\"We are dedicated to stamping out poverty in that area of the city, and food security is at the top of the list,\" said program manager Nick Shepard. \"It's a huge issue everywhere, and we wanted to take a look at that.\n\"I hope that this is the first step in significant action toward getting rid of this problem.\"\nLutes presents the findings of the survey on Thursday, Feb. 23, at 7 p.m. at at St. John the Baptist-King Edward School in Saint John.\nWith files from Information Morning Saint John", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:44:26.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
