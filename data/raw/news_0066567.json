Aan is to undergo an operation that could restore her sight. “It looks as though the dog has snapped the lead” Graham Crouth, mitigating \nProsecuting, Anna Barker told the court the girl was attacked when she was walking home with her mum on November 18 last year. \nShe said: “The girl was walking along the road when they approached the defendant's address and a rottweiler jumped up and almost over a low, brick wall and took hold of the girl by the right arm. \n\"She was dragged towards the wall and was screaming in pain and terror. \n\"Her mother and her friend managed to separate her daughter and the dog and they managed to get away. \n\"The dog was restrained by a tether but had managed to get up and onto the pavement.” \nThe court heard Reid later went to the family’s home and apologised, bringing gifts for the girl. \nGraham Crouth, mitigating, said Reid had never had any issues with the dog before. \nHe said: \"The dog is usually in the back yard but Miss Reid was getting some work done there, so it was outside the front of the house. \n\"It's usually tethered by a chain but, on this occasion, it was tethered by a lead. It looks as though the dog has snapped the lead. \n\"She has become aware very, very quickly about the incident and recovers the dog and puts it in the house.\" \nMagistrates ordered that Bruce must be muzzled and kept on a lead in public, as well as securely tied up in the garden. \nReid was also ordered to pay £20 compensation and £40 costs.
