Photo: John Russell, AP Houston singer Stephanie Rice raises her 'Voice' 1 / 31 Back to Gallery \nHouston singer Stephanie Rice raised her voice. And it earned her a spot on Team Gwen Stefani. \nRice, 27, piqued the interest of coaches Stefani and Blake Shelton on \"The Voice,\" which had its Season 12 premiere Monday on NBC. She poured truth and soul into a rendition of Kelly Clarkson's shattering \"Piece by Piece.\" \nRice is the lead singer for Houston band Colonial Blue, whose debut album, \"Dear Misery,\" was released in 2016 and was one of the year's best local releases, moving from folk and country to rock and pop . \n\"The way you sang that song, it's as if you wrote it,\" Shelton said after her \"Voice\" performance. He called it \"a moment for this show that I think we'll all remember.\" \n\"I was really moved by you,\" Stefani said. \"I could feel whatever pain is in there.\" \nIndeed, Rice's story revealed her own harrowing connection to the lyrics. \nRice lives in Houston but is from Redwater, a small town in northeast Texas. Her father was a Baptist pastor, and she told OutSmart magazine the family was \"very sheltered—nothing secular was allowed in the house.\" \nShe came out as a lesbian at 18 years old and described the experience in the OutSmart interview, which ended with her parents disowning her: \nI was 17 when I was first \"caught.\" I was dating this girl—the first girl I had ever come out to. One day we were at her house and her aunt came home early. Here I am, the preacher's daughter, a straight-A student, I'm in the worship band, I teach Sunday school—I was golden. This was juicy gossip for a small town. So the girl's aunt told my dad, and he came to my high school, pulled me out of class, and started questioning me. He grabbed me and said, \"If I find out any of this is true, I'm going to throw you around like a ping-pong ball.\" Luckily, my counselor overheard him and grabbed me and hid me in her office until he calmed down. \nAt the time, [all of this]—plus the idea of going to hell—caused me to run back into the closet at full speed. Not that I started dating guys—I just kept that part of my life as secretive as possible. My parents made me go to \"straight\" counseling, and I did all of that because I was scared. But I wasn't really changing—the counseling wasn't working. \nI had a basketball scholarship and was the salutatorian of my high school, but after that whole scene played out, he told me I wasn't \"fit\" to set an example for anyone, and I [wasn't allowed] to give my speech or accept my awards at graduation. That was the hardest thing for me because I had worked so hard for all of my grades and my achievements. My dad didn't let me go off to college for my basketball scholarship either, because \"[only] lesbians play sports.\" \nSo I started going to [my town's] community college, and that's where I met my first real girlfriend. One day, I came home after class because my dad said he wanted to talk. He basically said he had heard a rumor about me dating this girl, but he knew it wasn't true. But I knew, at that moment, I could not live a lie any longer. I knew I was miserable living that lie and that I was happiest when I was being my true self. So I said that it was true. Silence just fell upon the living room. My dad then told me I had two options: I could start going to counseling again, or if I \"choose\" to be this way, that I was history to them. I simply said that I was not going through counseling again, and he told me to pack my bags. I didn't get to say goodbye to my two little sisters who I had basically raised. They just drove me to the campus where I was attending school and they dropped me off in the parking lot. That scene is seared in my brain. I ran after them, but they didn't stop. \nIt's impossible to not be moved by Rice's story and her \"Voice\" performance. The emotion and honesty in her delivery was almost palpable. \nAnd it was also, quite possibly, the sound of a star being born. \nShe posted a thank you on Facebook shortly after her audition. \nI am so overwhelmed by all of your love and support that I am utterly speechless. There was a time in my life when I had zero self-worth and struggled to survive,\" it read. \"If I could only express to you in words how much tonight helped heal a lot of wounds. I hope through sharing my story, someone out there who needed to hear it now knows they are not alone. \nShe eventually graduated from the University of Houston with a biology degree. But has not had a relationship with her family in almost a decade. \n\"They're gonna realize they missed out on some pretty important stuff,\" Shelton said. \"Maybe this will bring them around.\" \nRice's full version of \"Piece by Piece\" is on iTunes . \nColonial Blue performs March 18 at 8th Wonder Brewery's fourth annual Celebr8tion of Beer , 2202 Dallas.
