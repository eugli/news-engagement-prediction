Seven teens fell through ice in Central Park on Monday. Rescuers were able to grab them from the frigid waters. \nThe septet, all ages 15 or 16, apparently wandered out on the ice to snap a photo — only to discover the ice wasn’t thick enough to maintain that much weight. Police and park visitors gather after the teens were rescued from the lake. (James Keivom/New York Daily News) \nWitnesses said they were talking pictures and jumping around just before the ice cracked beneath their feet, leaving the youths scrambling for their lives. \nAuthorities said all seven victims were taken to local hospitals for treatment of hypothermia after they were rescued around 6 p.m. One of the teens is taken away in a stretcher after the fall. \nA pair of male models were among the rescuers who plucked the boys from the icy lake.
