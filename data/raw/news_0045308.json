Trump’s “products have seen steeper price cuts on average when compared to the total number of discounted goods in the U.S.” \nPresident Donald Trump’s critics started the “Grab Your Wallets” campaign which boycotts goods associated with the Trump name. This, combined with allegations of stealing shoe designs and using real fur, have contributed to the decline of Ivanka’s fashion line. \nDespite this, sales of Ivanka’s self-titled perfume “took the two spots in Amazon’s best sellers in Women’s eau de parfum: one spot for the spray and one for the roll-on version,” according to CNN. \nDonald Trump’s presidency has already proven to be one of the most controversial and criticized in United States history. Only one month past his inauguration, several nationwide and international protests have broken out in condemnation of his policies. Most recent, according to the Inquisitr , was the nationwide “ Day Without Immigrants ” protest in “response to Donald Trump’s promises to tighten immigration and deport undocumented immigrants.

Last month, the president instituted an immigration ban which temporarily restricted the entry of people from seven Muslim-majority countries. When a judge blocked the ban, Trump ranted against him on Twitter. Trump has become infamous for using the popular social media site to criticize his opponents. \nTrump has also lashed out at the media , declaring “war on journalists and news outlets who dare to criticize his agenda,” according to the Inquisitr. \nIvanka Trump may not hold an official position in her father’s administration, but she is still being held accountable for his actions. She played a large role in his campaign, presenting a far more public image than her stepmother, First Lady Melania Trump. \nWhile First Lady Melania Trump has remained in New York City as her son, Barron Trump, finishes up the school year, Ivanka has stayed glued to her father’s side in Washington D.C. Melania has not shown interest in entering the world of politics, but Ivanka seems ready to take on the role of a dutiful politician’s daughter. \nRecently, Ivanka participated in roundtable discussion for female business leaders with her father and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, posting pictures of the event on her Instagram account. \nA post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Feb 13, 2017 at 10:30am PST \nA post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Feb 13, 2017 at 2:35pm PST \nIn the past week, Ivanka was also present at a press conference with Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and accompanied her father on a tour of a Boeing factory in South Carolina.
