Blaze: The bus on fire on Aspen Way in east London. (Daniel Hodgson) \nDaniel Hodgson, 32, described how he saw smoke was seeping through his open window at his flat on Blackwall Way. \nHe told the Standard : “I was asleep and I just heard a bang. It was loud, I’m quite a heavy sleeper. \n“I was quite dazed but I smelt smoke which was coming through the window. Billowing: Clouds of smoke rise from the burning bus in Poplar. (Daniel Hodgson) \n“The police and fire engines came and they were putting it out. The roads around were closed off.” \nVarun Vashist, who lives nearby, told the Standard: “We woke up by the sound of multiple blasts. Initially we just saw the thick smoke coming from the side of the building. \n“We immediately went down thinking it’s a building fire. Many others did the same. Aftermath: The wreckage of the double decker bus. (Daniel Hodgson) \n“We then saw the bus. The firefighters told us it’s safe to go back but to keep the windows closed.” \nThe burning bus was empty and there were no reports of any injuries, a spokesman for the Met Police said. \nIt appears the driver got out of the bus before the police were called at 12.49am, he added. Fire: The view from an apartment block in Blackwall Way. (Daniel Hodgson) \nOther people living nearby said the scene looked “absolutely awful” while many expressed concern for the bus driver. — Marlène Court (@marlenecourt) February 27, 2017 Just saw a whole London bus on fire — Christopher (@OhNoesItsChris) February 27, 2017 \nPhotos taken in daylight on Monday morning show the wreckage of the bus, which appears to have been burnt to less than half its size. \nRoads nearby including the East India Dock Tunnel were shut overnight while emergency services dealt with the incident. \nAmbulance staff were called to the blaze but confirmed no one was injured. \nThe London Fire Brigade has been contacted for comment.
