Missing in action \nThe Premier pledged Liberal support for more mountain bike trails if he wins a third term, but one thing was missing from the media event announcing the policy. Photo: Mr Barnett and Health Minister John Day had no luck finding a cyclist. (ABC News: Jacob Kagi) \nMr Barnett's office had tried to arrange for cyclists to attend, but none came. \nKeen to find riders for a vision opportunity, Mr Barnett and several aides climbed up to a nearby track to attempt to flag one passing by. \nWhen nobody rode past after more than five minutes waiting, they eventually gave up. One Nation casualties \nOne Nation has taken the unusual step of officially disendorsing two of its candidates, just a fortnight out from the election. \nDane Sorenson, who was standing for the party in North West Central, and Thornlie's Sandy Baraiolo have been removed from One Nation's online candidates list and had their social media pages deleted. \nProblem is, ballot papers have already been printed - so voters in these seats will still see the pair listed as One Nation candidates. \nPolitical analyst Peter Kennedy said the controversy \"might even boost their votes\". Shipbuilding promise \nLabor believes WA is missing out on defence contracts because the State Government is not advocating hard enough, and is promising a defence advocate and a Minister for Defence Issues if it wins government. \n\"I want to make sure we get our fair share of defence build,\" Opposition Leader Mr McGowan said. \nHe is also keen to lobby the US for more visits by its naval ships. \nBut Liberal Commerce Minister Michael Mischin said the State Government was already effective at lobbying for defence contracts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T10:38:43.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
