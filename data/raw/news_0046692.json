One tweet featuring the footage has already gotten more than 20,000 RTs.

The Atlanta rapper was part of the answer “Gucci Mane is featured on this duo’s number one hit ‘Black Beatles’.” \nThe rapper shared the clip on his own Instagram page and wrote “I think I need to co-host Jeopardy, wow.” \nWe’re all for if it means Alex Trebek gets a feature on the next Gucci Mane record.
