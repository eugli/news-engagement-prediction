Head coach Earl Watson went so far as to label him the team’s “ most athletic player ” earlier this season. \nConsidering the fact that guys like Eric Bledsoe and Marquese Chriss are also on the roster, that’s a big honor. \nAs stated above, Jones has been a viral sensation since high school. Check out the following video that shows off his hops on an up close and personal level. \nHere’s a compilation of some of his finer moments at a high schooler. \nSome guys are just born with natural hops! \nDunking in high school is fine and dandy, but he quickly shut down anyone’s questions of whether or not he could continue his high-flying ways in college. The following dunk was thrown down early on in his time at UNLV. \nJudging by the flight he showed there, might he take off from beyond the free throw line in the dunk contest? \nThe chances are pretty high. \nHere’s are two more examples of his insane hops from UNLV. The first took place in a preseason dunk show and the other took place during a game. \nWill he attempt to jump over five or six guys on his way to the rim? \nSince joining the D-League, many parts of his game have been identified as problem areas, but soaring through the sky and slamming the ball through the net isn’t one of them. Here are some of his finer dunks so far this season. \nYou’d be hard-pressed to find a better in-game dunker at the NBA level. Therefore, it makes sense why he’s taking part in the All-Star festivities from a pure entertainment perspective. \nNate Robinson was never an All-Star, but won three dunk contests. Might Jones take a similar path? He’s just 19 and has all the dunking potential in the world. \nAfter all, look at what he did in a 2014 dunk contest in City of Palms. \nYou can argue that those dunks would have won an NBA contest. \nWhile it’ll be tough to live up to last year’s battle between Zach LaVine and Aaron Gordon, the chances of Jones completing a dunk we have never seen before is very high considering his exceptional resume. \nOne thing will be certain after the contest: people will know who Derrick Jones Jr. is.
