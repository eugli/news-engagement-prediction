Trump to the presidency. Can a fun, kooky and colorful ad—featuring dancers from the Washington Ballet—help make the city a bit happier again? \nDesign Army hopes so, as it releases “The District of Joy,” a campaign for the new shopping district CityCenterDC, featuring a centerpiece film that the agency describes as “a two-minute romp … like a West Side Story + Austin Powers + 1960s fashion glam mashup.” \nThe film stars dancers from the Washington Ballet, which is another Design Army client, and the dancing was choreographed by Septime Webre, the former longtime artistic director of the ballet. \n“Crazy color meets kooky hairstyles that mimic designer shoes and ridiculously long noodles; giant balloons have sexy legs; and 13-layer sherbet ice cream cones exist in this fantastical world,” the agency says, adding: “And there’s nothing conservative about it!” \nCheck out the film here: \nAdweek spoke to Pum Lefebure, chief creative officer at Design Army, about her latest eye-catching creation. \nTell us about some of your favorite design touches in this fantastical world, and how it all came together. A few of the details that I loved: the 13-layer, giant ice-cream cones; the huge balloon costume; and the quick-cut of George Washington riding the bike. But if I had to pick one detail, it’s the wardrobe. The bright colors of the dancers and curated pops of colors make it a technicolor world. \nWith the Washington Ballet and Septime Webre involved, it seems like a great union of Design Army clients. Was it a natural fit? The fit was like a glove! The Washington Ballet was one of Design Army’s first-ever clients, and Septime has become a great friend. When we hatched the concept, Septime was our first call. He was just as excited—if not more—than we were, as he had free reign to choreograph, blending classical and modern, with his own unique twist. \nThe vibe must be pretty weird in Washington these days. Can an ad like this help lift the mood? Washington, D.C., is seeing it’s share of political weirdness these days, for sure. But the creative vibe in D.C. has never been stronger. We’ve seen the city’s creativity expand and spread all over—not just in design, but in everyday D.C. culture. The arts and restaurant scene is super hot; architecture and public art/spaces are finally getting with the program; and there’s more collaboration between these sectors that makes for a surprise every time you venture into the city. So, while The White House has been “interesting” recently, it does put the world’s eyes on D.C. more so than ever. Hopefully, this campaign will open those eyes a bit wider. \nCheck out the print work from the campaign below. \nCREDITS CityCenterDC General Manager: Timothy R Lowery CityCenterDC Director of Marketing: Whitney Bossin Burns Marketing Assistant : Cristian Becker \nCo-Founder & Chief Creative Officer, Design Army: Pum Lefebure CEO, Design Army: Jake Lefebure Art Director, Design Army: Heloise Condroyer Art Director, Design Army: Sucha Becky Managing Director: Ann Vogel Production Manager, Design Army: Olivia Prinzi Production Manager, Design Army: Svenja Herrmann BTS Photogrpahy, Design Army: Diego Jimenez Designer, Design Army: Rebecca Matt Designer, Design Army: Ryan Haskins Copywriter: Mark Welsh", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:32:17.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
