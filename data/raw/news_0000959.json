Kramnik commented to Chess.com: \n\"It was just a schedule problem. I have already commitments in the summer and autumn so if would have accepted, I would have played more or less four months in a row with some few days of breaks in between. Just too much.\" \nKramnik expressed his disappointment about how this year's chess calendar. \"It's stupid, since now I have nothing classical for some three months. They must meet somehow, the organizers, and make a decent schedule of tournaments. It's always the same: just a few first half and more than a full second half of the year.\" \nMany open tournament organizers would love to welcome Kramnik, who played the Qatar Masters in 2014 and 2015. Another participant in that tournament decided to play an open this spring: Anish Giri. The Dutchman is the top seed in the Reykjavik in April. \nKramnik: \"I would have gladly participated in two [of the Grand Chess Tour events], but not four. Since their regulations does not allow this, I have to miss all of them.\" \nPerhaps we'll see Kramnik playing anyway, since each event will also have wildcard players. The wildcards for the first two rapid events, in Paris and Leuven, will be announced \"as soon as all recipients of event level wildcards have confirmed their participation,\" says the press release. \nEach event in which a player competes will count toward their Grand Chess Tour score and final tour standings.
