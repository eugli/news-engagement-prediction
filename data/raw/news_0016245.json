(Getty Images) \n(CBS) Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett is a Super Bowl champion, having helped New England to its fifth title in his first season with the franchise. \nShortly after the Patriots’ 34-28 overtime victory over the Falcons in Super Bowl LI, Bennett also became the first athlete to decline an invitation to Donald Trump’s White House. \n“People know how I feel about that,” the outspoken Bennett said. “Just follow me on Twitter.” \nBennett said early in the week that he wouldn’t be attending if the Patriots won because he doesn’t support the individual in the White House. \nTrump, who was inaugurated as the 45th president two weeks ago, has been documented as being close with Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft. \nAfter New England’s victory, Trump took to Twitter. What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners.
