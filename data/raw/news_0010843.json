He told her that he had fixed her mom Desiree's cellphone and that Micaelyn had to take it home with her. \nTieman described how he had thrown her to the ground and stripped her naked before raping her. \nHe said he strangled her after she started screaming. He wrapped her body in a blanket which she had with her and put it near a window in his shack before covering it with ceiling board. \nHe then went to smoke dagga with his friends. \nAngry community \nHe said people started looking for Micaelyn after finding out that she'd gone missing. \nTieman said many people had asked him if he'd seen her that day and he said no. \nHe said he began to get nervous when he returned home later in the day because members of the community were getting angry. \nHe went to work as usual for three days. \nAccording to the plea agreement, the police arrived at his girlfriend's sister's home on May 1, took his and his girlfriend's cellphones and asked him to accompany them to the police station. \nThere they asked if he knew where Micaelyn's body was and he took them to his shack. \nHe also admitted to having taken the cellphone which Micaelyn had on her. \nNo remorse \nMicaelyn's father Milton Ludick testified that he'd asked Tieman on the day that she disappeared if he had seen her. Tieman said he hadn't. \nInvestigating officer Sergeant Benjamin van Wyk testified how they had tracked Tieman using cellphone information. \nState prosecutor Barth Baartman asked for the maximum sentence as Tieman had shown no remorse. \nIf the information gleaned from the cellphone hadn't tied him to the murder, he wouldn't have confessed, Baartman added. \nHe said his victim had been a young girl who couldn't defend herself against him. \nTieman was also found guilty on a charge of assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm in September 2013. \nHe will be sentenced for the rape and murder on Tuesday. \nsubmitted via MyNews24 .
