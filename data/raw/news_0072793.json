IndiaToday.in | Posted By Disha Roy Choudhury A + A - Photo: Pexels \nLoss of interest in activities, disturbed sleep and appetite or lack of concentration are common disabilities among people today. \nAnd the new study by World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified the biggest reason behind it. The new data released by WHO ranks depression as the single largest contributor to global disability worldwide. \nThe estimates reveal that more people are affected by depression than any other disease in the world with the numbers rising by 18 percent between 2005-15. \nWhat is noteworthy is that around 80 percent of the burden of depression is borne by people in the developing countries. India alone records a total of 5,66,75,969 cases of depressive disorders, that is, nearly five percent of the population. The number of anxiety disorder cases on the other hand was found to be 3,84,250,93, which is nearly three percent of the population. \nAlso Read:This is one research-backed way to get yourself out of depression \n\"If you look at the prevalence of different disorders around the world and you look at the disability that is associated with them - if you combine those together, depression ends up at the top of the list because it is very common. You can see one in 20 people in the world have it and then it has quite a high level of impairment or disability associated with it,\" Dan Chisholm, the author of the WHO study, was quoted as telling the reporters in Geneva, by The Hindu. \nThe study further deems depression as the major contributor to suicide deaths, reaching a number close to 8,00,000 a year. Suicide alone resulted in close to 1.5 percent of all deaths worldwide in 2015, making it one of leading causes of death.
