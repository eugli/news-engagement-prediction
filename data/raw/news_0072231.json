A Medical Intuitive can energetically read the insides (organs, glands, blood, etc.) of our bodies. \nThis work is done by intuitively scanning the body for areas or imbalance that may need alignment or treatment. Often times the Medical Intuitive will be able to explain the connection of the energy to an emotion or an event causing the illness. Intuited information can then be provided to the client's medical doctor and/or health care professional for further evaluation and discussion of possible treatments. Many medical intuitives work with (or are) medical doctors themselves. \nThere are many healers who I feel could easily fall under the category of medical intuitive but choose not to label themselves as such because they lack traditional medical training. These practitioners are often found in the non-medical healings arts which include energywork, bodywork , counseling, etc. These practitioners allow an inner knowing or intuitive nature to lead them where to lay hands on clients, offering them advice, etc. They can often identify energy blockages and imbalances, recognizing the strengths and weakness of their clients overall health and well being. \nLouise Hay's book entitled Heal Your Body is widely used as a medical intuitive resource book. \nNote: Although a Medical Intuitive can often see what a traditional examination may overlook a session with an Medical Intuitive is not recommended as a replacement for medical treatment. Famous Medical Intuitives \nPhineas Parkhurst Quimby - Dr. Quimby, with his clairvoyant faculty, gets knowledge in regard to the phenomena which does not come through the natural senses, and by explaining to his patients changes the direction of the mind, and the explanation is the science or cure. [Quimby and the patient] sit down together. He has no knowledge of the patient's feelings through his natural senses till after having placed his mind upon them. Then he becomes perfectly passive and, the patient's mind being troubled puts him into a clairvoyant state, together with his natural state, thus being in two states at once when he takes feelings, accompanied by their state of mind and thoughts. A history of their trouble thus learned, together with the name of the disease, he relates to the patient. This constitutes the disease and the evidences in the body are the effects of the belief he is not afraid of the disease. Not being afraid of the belief he is not afraid of the disease.
