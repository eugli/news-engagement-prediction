Martin is also accused of stealing a CIA document detailing foreign intelligence collection sources and methods, a National Reconnaissance Office document that had information about the launch of an intelligence satellite and an NSA document with information on planning and operations concerning suspected terrorists. \nMartin, a former U.S. Navy lieutenant, has been in custody since the FBI arrested him in August. \n\"The FBI investigation and this indictment reveal a broken trust from a security clearance holder,\" Gordon Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI's Baltimore field office, said in a statement. \nThe indictment does not say what, if anything, the government believes Martin did with the stolen documents. \nMartin's attorney, federal defender James Wyda, has previously described his client as a \"compulsive hoarder\" who never intended to harm his country and who took work documents home with him as he strove to be as committed to his job as possible. \nMartin is a former employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, a contractor which also employed NSA leaker Edward Snowden. Snowden fled to Moscow in 2013 after revealing details of the agency's surveillance operations. \nIf convicted, Martin faces up to 10 years in prison for each count. He is due to appear in court Feb. 14. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
