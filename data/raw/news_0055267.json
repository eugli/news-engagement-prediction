Assad's forces and US-backed fighters in rivalry to retake Raqqa from ISIL \nThe advance into the province, most of which is under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) , is part of an operation to encircle and ultimately capture its de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa in the north of the country. \nOne aim of the campaign is to cut ISIL's supply lines from Raqqa to Deir al-Zor province. \nThe move also expands the SDF's area of operations against ISIL, which is being fought by all sides in the complex Syria conflict. \nLater on Tuesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, reported that at least 11 people were killed and more than 35 wounded in air strikes in a town in northern Deir al-Zor province, in an area where US-led coalition warplanes have operated. \nIt was not clear whose air force had carried out the strikes, or if the incident was linked to the SDF advance, the Observatory said. \n\"Military operations of the SDF are now taking place within the provincial boundaries of Deir al-Zor, from the north - so, via southern Hasaka (province),\" the Kurdish military source told Reuters news agency.

Humanitarian concerns Syrian rebels meet fierce ISIL resistance in al-Bab \nTurkish-backed Syrian rebels, meanwhile, are fighting for control of the northern city of al-Bab, which monitors say is still mostly in ISIL hands, but which the rebels have pushed into. \nThat battle has brought the Turkish-backed rebels into close proximity with Syrian government forces, which had advanced towards the city from another direction before the rebels entered it. \nThe Syrian army's advance towards al-Bab has raised fears of sparking a confrontation with Turkey. \nThe United Nations said on Tuesday that an estimated 5,000 civilians were trapped by fighting in and around al-Bab and that 300 non-combatants had been killed since December, many of them by air strikes. \nTurkey and Russia have both been carrying out air strikes around the city. \n\"As the operation advances, parties to the conflict may be preparing for urban battles ... which could place civilians in the area at heightened risk of death and injury, as well as (making them) vulnerable to being used as human shields,\" the UN's humanitarian coordination body said in a statement. \nThe air strikes in the town of al-Sur in Deir al-Zor on Tuesday hit a garage, petrol station and commercial area, the Observatory reported.
