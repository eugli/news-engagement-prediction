it can be revealed. \nLord Mandelson, Labour ’s former communications director, Lord Kinnock, the party’s former leader, and Lord Patten, who served in Margaret Thatcher's cabinet, all still receive EU pensions. \nMany other former MEPs and European commissioners are also receiving payouts from a Brussels pension pot estimated to be worth £10 million. \nThe peers are facing demands to reveal their “financial interest” before speaking on Brexit legislation this week or face the “outrage” of the public. \nDominic Raab, a former justice minister, said: “Lords with generous EU pension pots should be open with the British people and declare this when they speak in Parliament on Brexit.\nWatch | SNP MPs told off for singing Ode To Joy during Brexit Bill vote 01:00 “It’s time the Lords came clean about their EU money and recognise the decision of the people by backing the Article 50 Bill unamended.”\nP ro-EU figures dismissed the concerns last night as “cheap, petty politics” and stressed that former MEPs and Commission figures are free to speak this mind. \nThe pressure comes with legislation giving the Prime Minister the power trigger Article 50 and begin Brexit talks reaching the House of Lords this week. \nTories fear Theresa May’s timeline of starting Brexit by the end of March could be put in doubt if peers repeatedly demand changes to the Bill. \nMore than 190 peers are due to speak, with Tories braced for amendment defeats because they do not have a majority in the Lords. \nProtections for the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and assurances over a vote on the final Brexit deal could be secured. \nChange Britain, a Eurosceptic campaign group co-founded by former justice secretary Michael Gove, is concerned voters may not know financial links between some peers and Brussels. \nWatch | Corbyn heads to Parliament ahead of Brexit Bill vote 00:22 F ormer European commissioners and MEPs enjoy pensions worth tens of thousands of pounds a year when they leave their roles. \nHowever those who become peers are under no strict obligation to declare the payments when they speak in the Lords about EU matters. \nAnalysts from Change Britain have identified more than 20 pro-EU peerswho enjoy such pensions and estimated what they receive annually. \nLord Kinnock, a former vice president of the European Commission who described the Brexit result as ‘appalling’, is estimated to get almost £90,000 a year. \nLord Mandelson, a former trade commissioner who played a central party in the Remain campaign, is estimated to receive around £35,000 a year. \nLord Patten, who served in the European Commission from 2000-2004, is believed to get close to £40,000 a year. \nWatch | David Davis opens Brexit debate: Do we trust the people or not? 01:26 T he payments are estimates, based on applying the Commission's pension rules to salaries the politicians enjoyed during their jobs. \nFormer European Commissioners in office before 1 May 2004 are entitled to a pension worth 4.5 per cent of the salary they last received for each year of service. \nChange Britain is organising a campaign to urge Britons to email peersclaiming such pensions demand they declare their interests. \n“I understand that you may have income or a pension from the European Union due to your work there in the past on behalf of the UK,” the note reads.\n“Will you therefore also commit to declare any financial interest before you speak in the debates on the passage of the Article 50 legislation through the House of Lords?”\nRoad to Brexit | Article 50 and the House of Lords E urosceptic critics have also claimed that the public should be made aware of an “oath of loyalty” to Brussels made by those who work for the Commission. \nCommission rules demand that \"an official has the right to freedom of expression, with due respect to the principles of loyalty and impartiality.\" \nHowever Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader who is calling for a second referendum, last night dismissed concerns over the pensions and called the demands a “stunt”. \nHe said: \"This is cheap, petty politics. Dominic Rabb cannot believe that the people would not mention that they used to be MEP's or commissioners when they speak in the House of Lords debate. He used to be a minister, so you would hope he would have actually known the rules.”\nAt a glance | How members of the House of Lords are appointed Pro-EU peers and their Brussels pensions Lord Mandelson E uropean Commissioner from November 2004 to October 2008\nEstimated value of EU pension: £34,659 a year\nLord Kinnock European Commissioner from July 1995 – November 2004, Vice-President of the European Commission from September 1999 – November 2004\nEstimated value of EU pension: £87,794 a year\nLord Patten of Barnes European Commissioner from January 2000 - November 2004 \nEstimated value of EU pension: £39,845 a year\nAmounts estimated by Change Britain", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:15:00.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
