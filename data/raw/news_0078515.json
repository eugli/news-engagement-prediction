What is anorexia? \nAnorexia involves inadequate food intake leading to low weight. \nSelf esteem can become overly related to body weight and shape. \nAnd there is an intense fear of weight gain and fat, and obsession with behaviours preventing weight gain. \nEven when very unwell, it is common for someone with anorexia to be unable to appreciate the severity of the situation. \nTo avoid food, the individual can become uncharacteristically deceptive. \nThey may say they’re not hungry, or they’ve already eaten, and they can become very socially isolated as many social situations revolve around food. What is bulimia? (Picture: Getty) \nIn contrast, bulimia involves periods of consuming large volumes of food while feeling out of control, followed by behaviours used to prevent weight gain, known as purging, such as vomiting. \nSelf esteem can also become overly related to body weight and shape. \nSome people with bulimia may have a healthy weight for their height and age but their binge-purge behaviour will dominate their life and can have serious consequences on their physical health such as vitamin and mineral deficiencies. What is binge eating disorder? (Picture: Mmuffin for Metro.co.uk) \nBinge eating disorder involves periods of consuming large volumes of food, to the point of discomfort. \nSuffers may feel out of control, including eating when not hungry. \nThere are also behaviours indicating shame and guilt, such as secret eating \nBinge eating disorders are not just about eating too much occasionally, they are about using the consumption of food as a way of managing emotions on a regular (daily) basis. \nWhen, how and where they are going to obtain and consume the food will be constant questions for the individual. What is an eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS)? (Picture: Mmuffin for Metro.co.uk) \nThere are some patters of eating that causes significant distress but does not meet the criteria to be diagnosed with another eating disorder. \nFor example, a person might show symptoms of restricted eating, as with anorexia, but remain within normal weight limits for height and age. \nThey might exhibit binging and purging behaviour, but less often than seen in bulimia. \nThey could also show purging behaviour without binging behaviour or binging behaviour less often than in binge eating disorder. Other eating disorders (Picture: Mmuffin for Metro.co.uk) \nEating disorders don’t just stop with weight-related conditions. \nPica, for example, involves eating things that are not food and do not have nutritional value. \nNight eating syndrome is where the majority of calorie intake occurs in evening/at night. \nThe quantity is not objectively large, unlike binge eating, but sufferers do feel they do not have control and feel guilty about the pattern of eating. Mukbangs show vloggers feasting on screen – but do they help or trigger people with eating problems? \nThere’s also rumination disorder where the sufferer regurgitates already swallowed food, which is then swallowed again. \nOther behaviours related to eating disorders include chewing food and spitting it out before swallowing it, exercising excessively, using diuretics or laxatives, body checking (holding or pinching specific parts of the body, obsessively measuring or looking in the mirror at specific parts of the body) and obsessive weighing. \nMost people will be able to relate to eating a bit less or a bit more at various times in their lives but it becomes a disorder when the eating behaviour becomes a focus, and when it takes priority over other aspects of the person’s life. Why do people develop eating disorders? (Picture: Mmuffin for Metro.co.uk) \nAlthough people are not ‘born with’ any eating disorders, it is thought someone’s genetic makeup predisposes them to develop an eating disorder . \nTypical characteristics of someone who develops an eating disorder will include being a perfectionist, having low self esteem, being a worrier and being obsessive. \nIf someone is predisposed to an eating disorder, a number of things may occur that could then trigger the illness. \nThis includes bullying or abuse (at home, school or work); bereavement; life event such as having a child, getting married or moving house; and financial concerns. \nThere is often a lot of guilt, shame and secrecy involved with eating disorders. \nIt can be very difficult to spot eating disorders when the behaviours are hidden behind closed doors. \nThis also means it’s very difficult for someone to get the support needed to break the cycle of behaviours. Who develops eating disorders? \nStats show that 6.4% of adults show signs of an eating disorder. \nBetween 11 – 25% of sufferers are male. \nEating disorders are seen in people from aged six to people in their 70s. \nAnd people with a female relative with an eating disorder are between 3.7 and 11.4 times more likely to develop an eating disorder.
