Get your 30-day Free Trial\nFormer Florida State star Malik Beasley was honored during the first half of the team's game against Boston College. Ryan S. Clark/Warchant For anyone who wonders how good this year's Florida State men's basketball team would be with Malik Beasley, Beasley has asked himself the same question.\nBeasley, who left FSU after one season, made a surprising return Monday for his alma mater's game against Boston College at the Tucker Center. The former FSU star, who was a first-round pick of the Denver Nuggets last summer, returned to Tallahassee for the first time since departing for the NBA.\nHe spoke to Warchant during halftime on several items including what it's like to be in the NBA and if he thinks about \"what could have been\" if he stayed for one more year.\n\"Yeah, definitely. I would have got better just like I got better in the NBA,\" said Beasley, who averaged 15.6 points in his lone season at FSU. \"But it would have been crazy. We would have had the fans going, we'd be ranked No. 1 right now. But I don't regret my decision, but I really do miss Florida State and the people here.\"\nBeasley's departure, at times, has been a talking point for Seminoles fans this season. No. 19 FSU (22-6, 10-5 Atlantic Coast Conference) is enjoying one of the best years in school history.\nThe belief has revolved around the idea FSU would be a national title favorite if it had Beasley, Dwayne Bacon and Jonathan Isaac on its roster.\nBeasley, 20, has gone back and forth between the Nuggets and their NBDL affiliate in Sioux Falls, S.D. He's played four games in the D-League, averaging 18.5 points and 5.0 rebounds in less than 28 minutes. As of late, he's been with the Nuggets and is averaging 2.7 points in 4.9 minutes across 18 games.\n\"This year has been pretty fun. A lot of learning experiences for me, up and down,\" Beasley said. \"It's been a process. I love it.\"\nBeasley, who is the first one-and-done player in FSU's history, said the life of playing as a professional is different than that of a college student.\nAs a college students, he'd juggle the demands of going to class and doing homework along with games, practices and going on the road.\nEven though he's a professional, Beasley said he is taking online courses in the hopes of getting his degree from FSU in the next three to four years.\n\"Just because even though I left, that was still my decision if I was going to continue my work,\" Beasley said. \"I still wanted that stage no matter if I went to school or went to the NBA. I want to continue my dreams and walk on that stage.\"\nBeasley sat courtside during Monday's game and was later honored on the videoboard during the first half.\nHe said some of his former teammates knew he was coming, but it still caught others off guard.\nFSU was walking off the court when Beasley was off to the side giving everyone high-fives. It led to him getting some hugs from players with assistant coach Charlton Young grabbing him by the hair and then hugging him. Beasley then hugged Seminoles coach Leonard Hamilton before going into the locker room with the team.\nBeasley said he still talks with former teammates like Bacon and Terrance Mann, who were all part of the same signing class in 2015.\nHe said it was weird coming back even though he still keeps tabs on the team by watching games when he can. As it turns out, Beasley has another tie to FSU as he's cousins with freshman guard Trent Forrest.\nBeasley said he was going to stay in town through the evening and then head back on Tuesday morning.\n\"It's just a blessing to see the guys,\" Beasley said. \"I'm glad I'm here.\"", "external_links": ["https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/lkxeyq8o6wr9qq3t2i7e)", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/lkxeyq8o6wr9qq3t2i7e"], "published": "2017-02-21T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:47:08.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
