Danny Welbeck can appreciate that sentiment as he revealed which of his colleagues he used to hate. \nFamously not all teammates, or for that matter colleagues, get on and some, like Andy Cole and Teddy Sheringham downright loathe each other. \nHowever that ill feeling never stopped Teddy and Andy getting on once they were on the pitch and the pair made a decent strikeforce at Old Trafford during the Treble and three title wins for the Red Devils. \nFor Danny Welbeck arriving at the Emirates in August 2014, as Radamel Falcao arrived at Old Trafford, he was united with one player he used to hate, Kieran Gibbs. \nAs reported by Metro the Arsenal forward revealed his hatred of the full-back stretched back to their FA Youth Cup days saying: \n\"It was the first time we prepared like it was a first team match. \n\"It was a special moment. Obviously me and Gibbo are very close friends now but back then I used to hate him to be honest. \n\"He was bigger than me, faster than me, he was so strong and I was like 'what is this guy about?\" \nThe pair met as Arsenal played Manchester United at the semi-final stage of the cup back in 2007, with the Manchester club coming out on top 4-3 on aggregate. \nGibbs actually scored the opening goal in the tie, with Arsenal going 1-0 up at the Emirates, however Welbeck would have the last laugh, scoring the winner at Old Trafford. \nFortunately now at the Emirates together the pair don't hate each other. \nI'm just not sure they'll end up with two kids together like my auntie and uncle but who knows...
