Some people don't have shoes. \nâ€” Reagan Lapietra (@ReaganElap) February 13, 2017 \nGuess Chelseaâ€™s not thinking about them. Sheâ€™s far too busy patting herself on the back. Perfectly good shoes, there's homeless & women in shelters that could use those. Pretty damn selfish to burn them.

You could donate them, you could do a lot of things, but instead you do internet stunts. https://t.co/wf2YSrx0n0 \nâ€” Mickey White (@BiasedGirl) February 13, 2017 @chelseahandler @realDonaldTrump Yeah, def throw them away, bc there's no poor people in need or anything.
