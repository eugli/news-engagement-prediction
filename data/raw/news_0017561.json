It’s been a problem of priorities.\"\nRepublicans, who have overwhelming control of the House, have proposed a road-funding plan that would increase the gas tax by 10 cents a gallon, phase in the use of all gas tax money entirely for roads and require a study on interstate tolls.\nDuring earlier testimony on the House Republican plan, Democrats first brought up decreasing the corporate tax cuts as a way to save money for roads. Since 2011, the corporate tax rate has decreased 2.5 percentage points, and will continue to decrease until the 2021 fiscal year.\nBy freezing future cuts on corporate tax, Democrats hope to save $100 million per year by the 2021 fiscal year.\nHouse Democrats initially proposed eliminating the final year of an income tax break for those earning $150,000 or more per year and couples earning $300,000. But they dropped that portion of the plan later Monday, reducing estimates of the first year of their road funding plan to $782 million.\nHouse Speaker Brian Bosma, R-Indianapolis, said the Democrat proposal would hurt the state's business climate.\n\"Their plan would raise taxes, result in cuts to education and jeopardize our state’s AAA credit rating,\" Bosma said in a statement. \"In the last month alone, we have heard of many jobs and business investments coming to Indiana in direct response to our state’s top-ranked business climate and pro-growth policies. Raising taxes on Hoosier employers is the wrong move and would be a major employment setback for the average worker.\"\nINDIANAPOLIS STAR\nGas pump advertising campaign targets Indiana fuel tax hike\nINDIANAPOLIS STAR\nSenate GOP won't rule out gas tax hike\nINDIANAPOLIS STAR\nLawmakers limit how much gas taxes could increase under new bill\n147 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //indy.st/2kGiDvs", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//indy.st/2kGiDvs&text=House%20Democrats%3A%20No%20need%20to%20increase%20gas%20tax%20for%20road%20funding&via=indystar", "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwix-ZyktPzRAhVCzIMKHTtNDCEQqQIIIygAMAM&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indystar.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F01%2F10%2Fsenate-gop-wont-rule-out-gas-tax-hike%2F96366910%2F&usg=AFQjCNFAq89UOauqsYeSnLNWn9aWlqNFpQ&sig2=-hBtZq855FinJZ2T8yVsgw&bvm=bv.146094739,d.amc", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/57c10ab15566a70b8277ab5d7b9650d8f35296e6/r=281x400/local/-/media/2015/06/25/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635708436187495028-Scott-Pelath2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f52819b7199fee0d66f3be91808286e10b781682/c=394-0-1106-949&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/06/25/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635708436187495028-Scott-Pelath2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e13b85bfbb7760136797ecb2d7c6a5692115af19/c=0-135-2120-1333&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2017/01/25/INGroup/Indianapolis/636209662488163252-Gas-blue-handle-bracelet-Thinkstock.jpg", "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwix-ZyktPzRAhVCzIMKHTtNDCEQqQIIHSgAMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indystar.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F01%2F25%2Flawmakers-limit-how-much-gas-taxes-could-increase-under-new-bill%2F97031964%2F&usg=AFQjCNGQwXtk3UNw0x55UinvoJi4Q0jmNw&sig2=KTf4bwaXKuir1JDH3pCedw&bvm=bv.146094739,d.amc", "http://indy.st/2kGiDvs", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/06/25/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635708436187495028-Scott-Pelath2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffa29046f404cbeed64751b76acd8e843cc5a933/c=157-0-1572-1415/local/-/media/2017/01/25/INGroup/Indianapolis/636209662488163252-Gas-blue-handle-bracelet-Thinkstock.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b40610d7109b88989984d98c9ac1887b7f34170b/c=0-607-2099-1793&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2017/01/10/INGroup/Indianapolis/636196483229705130-davidlong.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//indy.st/2kGiDvs&mini=true"], "published": "2017-02-07T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:54:09.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
