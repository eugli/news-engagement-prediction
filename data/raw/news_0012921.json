And considering its low price, it exceeds expectations in most categories. \nScroll down for a closer look: View As: One Page Slides Recently, I had the opportunity to take a 2017 Chevy Cruze on a road trip from New York to Connecticut. There are four different models: the L, LS, LT, and Premier. For this trip, I tried out the LT, which totals $24,835. The Cruze is a compact hatchback at 183.7 inches long that competes with vehicles like the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic. The vehicle is Chevrolet's best-selling car globally. All models come with a 1.4-liter turbocharge 4-cylinder engine with 153 hp and 177 lb.-ft. of torque. It also comes with forward-wheel drive. From personal experience, the car packs a surprising amount of punch. Business Insider/Danielle Muoio \nYou can also get my breakdown about how it performs in snow here . I had a close call when I was in a lane that merged faster than I had expected. I pushed the accelerator to pass a car riding in my blind spot and audibly gasped by how quickly it zipped ahead. Throughout my entire trip, the car's passing abilities consistently beat my expectations. \nTop Speed reports that the vehicle can accelerate to 60 mph in 7 seconds. The vehicle gets 32 miles per gallon and has an annual fuel cost of $1,150. That seems on par with what I experienced. After a little over 4 hours of driving, I went through half a tank of gas. 32 mpg combined; 29 mpg in a city; and 38 mpg on a highway. Business Insider/Danielle Muoio The LT I drove comes with Chevrolet's MyLink Radio â€” a 7-inch, full-color touchscreen that comes available with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and SiriusXM radio. The touchscreen is fairly minimalistic, which made it easy to figure out. Business Insider/Danielle Muoio I plugged my phone into the car's USB port to navigate with Apple CarPlay and had no issues. Radio connectivity was solid despite driving through mountains. The touchscreen was also consistently responsive. Business Insider/Danielle Muoio Inside, the Cruze is a very no-frills car. There's a tiny display in the instrument cluster that can relay information like the speed. At one point, it actually warned me I was driving over ice, which was helpful since it must have certainly been black ice. Business Insider/Danielle Muoio You can take calls over Bluetooth using buttons on the steering wheel. The sound quality is on par with other cars from what I gathered. You can also use that wheel menu to change what notifications appear in the instrument cluster's display. Business Insider/Danielle Muoio One of the car's biggest perks is that it comes available with 4G LTE and WiFi. I used it to download some new Spotify playlists before hitting the road and had no issues with speed. Business Insider/Danielle Muoio Overall, there's not a ton of settings, but Chevy did a good job choosing the necessities. The infotainment center itself was well-placed and I rarely felt like I was overreaching to fiddle with the radio. Like most cars today, the Cruze comes with a key fob instead of your traditional key. You can purchase keyless entry for extra, which allows you to open the door by touching a button on the handle if the key fob is in your pocket. Business Insider/Danielle Muoio The vehicle does come with some driver assistance features. The LT I drove comes with features like Side Blind Zone alert, which came in the form of a yellow blinking light under the side mirror. Like most blind spot warnings that come under the mirror, it did the job, but I barely found it caught something I wouldn't otherwise see. Business Insider/Danielle Muoio \nI tend to be more partial to blind spot warning systems like one in the Nissan Rogue , which places the light inside the car instead of on the sideview mirror. These are way easier to see and, therefore, alert you to an upcoming car before you're likely to see it. \nThat being said, the Chevy Cruze alert system does work, but by design it doesn't provide enough advance warning that I'd go out of my way to purchase it if I'm looking to streamline costs. The LT also comes available with Rear Park Assist, Rear Cross Traffic alert, and Lane Change Alert. \nThe Premier model comes with more advanced driver assistance features, like Forward Collision Alert and Lane Departure Warning with Lane Keep Assist, but I can't speak to those settings having driven the LT. My biggest gripe with the vehicle comes down to comfort. Try as I might, I couldn't get comfortable. I didn't find the cloth seats to be very supportive, especially for a long drive. It's something to keep in mind if you plan to use the Cruze for big road trips, but for day-to-day driving, you should be fine. Business Insider/Danielle Muoio The Cruze is a great little highway car with all the necessary features you need if you're looking to buy a vehicle without spending an absurd amount of money. It's not the comfiest drive I've ever experienced, but for what you're spending, it's easy to see why the hatchback is so popular.
