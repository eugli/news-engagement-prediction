Remember Me Jeon So Mi deletes her selfie with Choi Yoo Jung By jennywill 13 minutes ago 9,641 408 7 0 Google+ IOI 's Jeon So Mi deleted the photo she took with Choi Yoo Jung . She'd originally posted the photo below with fellow (past) IOI member Choi Yoo Jung planting a kiss on her cheeks. She wrote, \" Hello~~~ It's Somi. I started Instagram for the first time. Please show me a lot of support~ \". For some reason, however, the photo has been deleted off her Instagram. There's still a video Choi Yoo Jung took of her eating chicken, and then a series of selfies while she was on ' Unnies' Slam Dunk ', but this picture seems to have disappeared. \nWhat do you think happened?
