By James Michael Nichols \nProtest art is nothing new. \nFor years, people have used art in a multitude of mediums to express discontent with, among other things, a current political climate or the state of the world around them. \nAnd on Valentine‚Äôs Day, a dating app called Hater projected an image of a naked Putin fondling a pregnant Trump on the side of buildings in New York‚Äôs Williamsburg and Chelsea neighborhoods. A post shared by Hater (@lovethroughhate) on Feb 14, 2017 at 7:01pm PST \nOf course, we‚Äôve seen similar images in the past, like when this mural of the pair kissing popped up in Lithuania‚Äôs capital last May. A photo posted by @keuleruke on May 12, 2016 at 5:17am PDT \nSure, the images may be made from artists around the globe, but they all share a common theme: they reinforce the idea that affection or romance between two men is either something to be mocked or a sign of weakness. \nAnd at the end of the day, this outdated belief is rooted in homophobic notions of how men should act with one another. \nThe artist‚Äôs real ‚Äújoke‚Äù here, of course, lies in the fragile, toxic nature of masculinity and the idea that affection between men is so outrageous that depicting these two (very unpopular) world leaders in this way is somehow funny. \nBut it‚Äôs not. And this idea that queer men are somehow weak or more effeminate than those identifying as straight ‚Äï and that this makes them mockable ‚Äï is something that LGBTQ people have always fought throughout history. Sean Gallup via Getty Images \nThe questions we should be asking ourselves are: Why do we keep seeing different variations of this Trump/Putin image? What is so funny about love between men? Why is the idea that failing masculinity through male-on-male affection one that our culture reproduces over and over again? Even in art-based contexts that are supposed to be progressive? \nWe all know that masculinity is fragile ‚Äï so fragile in fact that it seems to be the end-game that many Americans go to when they‚Äôre reaching for something to make fun of Trump about. \nBut we need to do better. There are ways to critique our president and his alleged problematic relationship with Vladimir Putin without placing that critique in a framework that, at the end of the day, is homophobic. @cher what's wrong with this picture üòÇüòÇüòÇ pic.twitter.com/uMJQ0FhYAx ‚Äî Heather ‚ù£Ô∏èüíñ (@HJay1976) August 8, 2016 \nTo be fair, there is something to be said for the idea of reframing their relationship through a queer lens that empowers gayness and celebrates queer relationships. Tenderness between two men shouldn‚Äôt be alarming, even it it‚Äôs Trump and Putin. \nBut I suspect that isn‚Äôt the intentions of the artists creating these works. \nWe are all living in scary, surreal times. But let‚Äôs be intentional in the ways we‚Äôre dealing with that reality ‚Äï and intentional about the choices we make with our forms of resistance, no matter what medium that may be.
