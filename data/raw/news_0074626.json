Thank you @GovChrisSununu for standing up to allow the people the natural right to protect themselves. #KeptHisPromise https://t.co/XSyiL3rm1D — Rep. JR Hoell (@NH_Braveheart) February 22, 2017 \nPreviously, they had to apply every four years, to local police chiefs, for a licence to carry a concealed weapon in a purse, carrier bag, car or briefcase. The new bill abolishes that requirement. \nCheers erupted from dozens of supporters after Mr Sununu, a former environmental engineer and businessman, put pen to paper, The Concord Monitor reported. Signing #SB12 into law is a commitment I made to the people of New Hampshire. I am proud today to fulfill that commitment. pic.twitter.com/Nv77DwLLkp — Chris Sununu (@GovChrisSununu) February 22, 2017 \nCritics argued the licencing system was too subjective. \n“We have seen substantial abuse of the current statutes by various police departments,” said Republican New Hampshire representative JR Hoell. \nThe National Rifle Association said New Hampshire is at least the eleventh state to abolish mandatory concealed carry licences. InsideGov | Graphiq \nBut the move was criticised in some quarters. \nJoseph Plaia, a police commissioner in the state and member of the Granite State Coalition for Common Sense, said: “This bill will eliminate the state’s longstanding permitting system and prevent local law enforcement from making important determinations that help keep guns out of dangerous hands.” \nThe chairman of the state Democratic Party, Ray Buckley added: “The governor is making it harder for law enforcement officials to keep track of guns that fall into the wrong hands,” \nThe US Senate has already voted to scrap regulations, surrounding gun sales to people suffering mental disorders , proposed by Barack Obama’s team. \nThere were 372 mass shootings in the US in 2015, killing 475 people and wounding 1,870, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker.
