The system stores the data about the crimes and in which areas and based on the data, the system will analyse it and will provide the police information about the location of the future crime.”\nBrig Al Suwaidi said police will use facial software technology to make identification of suspects easier for officers working in connection to surveillance and investigations operations.\n“This technology will provide the information to the duty officer about any suspect depending on the big data in the operation room and the criminal system,” Brig Al Suwaidi said.\nDubai Police said that its the first known system in the region using artificial intelligence and that the technology will help to reduce number of crimes in Dubai and will cut the time needed to respond and reduce crimes.\n“We want to have a new modern command room as part of Dubai Police strategy to secure the city. We want to have a smart security system,” Brig Al Suwaidi said.\nAutomated alerts compiled and sent by artificial intelligence technology will notify the police officer about any traffic or people gathering in Dubai in order to respond faster in incidents requiring immediate police presence, he said.\nThe command room will include a smart security system to predict future crimes.\n“The system will provide data and information about the areas where crimes are likely to be committed. The system stores the data about the crimes and in which areas, and based on the data the system will analyse it and will alert the police about the likely location of the future crime.”\nSince the present command room was launched in 2006, he said that it was now time to upgrade the systems. The room has 40 screens linked together to cover the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:42:57.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
