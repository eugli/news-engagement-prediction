(David J. Phillip/AP) \n“People are people/So why should it be/You and I should get along so awfully/So we're different colors/And we're different creeds/And different people have different needs.” \nMore information on Spencer’s pop culture tastes will have to wait for another day, as he was kicked out of the conference while holding court in the lobby of the Gaylord National Resort. \n\"His views are repugnant and have absolutely nothing to do with conservatism or what we do here,\" CPAC spokesman Ian Walters told NPR . \n“He's anti-free markets, anti-Constitution, anti-pluralism. This was one bad egg who bought a ticket.” \nWalters also described Spencer as “vile,” “venomous,” “horrible” and “repulsive.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:29:55.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
