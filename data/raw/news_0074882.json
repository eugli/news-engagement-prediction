We conducted raids in Rajkot and Bhavnagar and nabbed the duo,” Bhatt told reporters in Ahmedabad today. Investigation has revealed that the two had planned to attack the famous temple at Chotila town of Surendranagar district, ATS ACP B S Chavda said.\nYou may also like to watch this video :\nHe said that to create terror, they planned to record and upload the video of the attack on social media. They had also planned to carry out blasts at different places and also set on fire vehicles to spread terror, Chavda said.\nThe brothers, who had degrees in computer application, were indoctrinated in jihadi philosophy during the last two years after coming in contact with ISIS literature online, Chavda said. They were also in touch with ISIS controversial preacher Mufti Abdus Sami Qasmi, arrested by NIA in February 2016, said the officer.\n“They were on our radar since last three months. When we arrested them, they were in the process of making an improvised bomb to carry out lone-wolf style attacks,” he said.\nLone wolf style attacks are those wherein a person prepares and commits violent acts alone without assistance from any group. However, he or she may be influenced by the ideology of an external group, and may act in support of such a group.\nArif Ramodiya, the father of the suspects, claimed that he did not have any knowledge about the activities of his sons.\nAccording to him, Wasim used to work at a Rajkot-based graphic designing firm after completing his MCA, while Naeem used to work with a ship recycling unit in Bhavnagar after completing his BCA.\n“I came to know about the activities of my sons only after police raided my residence and arrested Wasim. I had absolutely no idea about their allegiance with ISIS. “No one from my family knew about it. This is really shameful for me. It has ruined my reputation,” said Arif, who was visibly shocked over the arrests.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/LJgt0cH6BBc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent"], "published": "2017-02-27T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:46:30.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
