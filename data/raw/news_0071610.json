Trump is pictured on February 23 It also said the allegations were based off interviews it has carried out with four 'current and former American officials'. The alleged contact was uncovered by US intelligence agencies that were working at the time to figure out if the president's campaign team was working with Russia in regards to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee or other attempts to influence the election. The report was dismissed by the Kremlin. 'Let's not believe anonymous information,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters about the report, noting that the newspaper's sources were unnamed. 'It's a newspaper report which is not based on any facts.' Trump has been shadowed by questions about potential ties to Russia since winning the election. US intelligence agencies have also concluded that Russia meddled in the campaign to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Last week, Trump fired national security adviser Michael Flynn because he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the US Flynn, who was interviewed by the FBI about his contacts, is said to have talked with the ambassador multiple times during the transition, including about American sanctions policy. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow on February 23 Putin is seen speaking with officers at the Kremlin press conference on February 23 Still, Trump and his advisers have denied contacts with Russian officials during the election. Last week, Trump said 'nobody that I know of' spoke with Russian intelligence agents during the campaign. Priebus alluded to his contacts with the FBI over the weekend, telling Fox News 'the top levels of the intelligence community' have assured him that the allegations of campaign contacts with Russia were 'not only grossly overstated, but also wrong.' Democrat Sen. Ron Wyden said Priebus' comments opened the door for FBI Director James Comey to discuss the bureau's investigation publicly. 'If the White House chief of staff can make public claims about the supposed conclusions of an FBI investigation, then Director Comey can come clean with the American people,' Wyden said. Justin Shur, a former Justice Department public corruption prosecutor, said it was imperative that Justice Department investigations not be swayed by political considerations. 'As a general matter, investigations and prosecutions should be about gathering the facts and the evidence and applying the law,' Shur said. During the campaign, Trump and other Republicans vigorously criticized a meeting between then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton, husband of Trump's general election opponent. The meeting came as the FBI - which is overseen by the Justice Department - was investigating Hillary Clinton's use of a private email address and personal internet server.
