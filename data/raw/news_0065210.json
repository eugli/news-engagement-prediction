Yatani termed as propaganda claims that he wants to use the back door to clinch the Jubilee ticket. He added that it is not a secret any more that he wants to join Jubilee. \nMarsabit Governor Ukur Yatani is set to join the Jubilee Party after ditching the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). \n“Plans are under way to join JP so that we can seek our re-election,” Mr Yatani said Tuesday. \nThe governor also condemned what he termed “political tourism”, saying leaders from other counties have been pitching camp in Marsabit to politick. \n“Those coming from Tana River and Isiolo counties to tell our people how our leadership should be are outsiders. They do not know how we operate in our county,” he said. \nThe county boss challenged his opponents to tell the people what they will do if elected. \n“Instead of trying to convince people that the county government has done no development, tell them what you want to do,” said Mr Yatani. \nHe said the leaders who are spreading propaganda that he wants to use the back door to clinch the Jubilee ticket should know that he will join the party through the open route. \nNOT A SECRET ANYMORE \nHe added that it is not a secret any more that he wants to join Jubilee. \n“There is no need in giving warnings and threats to the president over ticket issues. We soon will know the decision of the people because they have the voice,” said Mr Yatani \nOn Saturday, gubernatorial aspirant and NHIF boss Mohamud Ali said that the governor has been attending meetings with the president and his deputy trying to join Jubilee as the general elections approach. \nHe said that he and his team are Jubilee members and founders of the party in Marsabit and are therefore not afraid of intruders. \n“If they want to join Jubilee let them come through the right path instead of trying to use the backdoor. We will gladly welcome them and meet them in the nominations. We are not afraid because we believe the people have the voice,” said Mr Mohamud.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:51:30.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
