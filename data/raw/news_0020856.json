Finally, they say, the time is right to produce Brecht's second version of his work, which the playwright translated into English and reworked in collaboration with actor Charles Laughton. Katherine Owens, artistic director of Undermain Theatre in Dallas, and her husband, Bruce DuBose, the company's producing director, who stars as the title character in \"Galileo\" at the Undermain.

(Rose Baca/Staff Photographer) \n\"This is about the question of what does one man owe the community and what constitutes courage. It's a philosophical argument, but it's not laid out in a polemic way. You want to take Galileo's side, but there is another side. Brecht was a religious person and he felt there could be a reconciliation between faith and science.\" \nThe German-born playwright wrote his first take, Life of Galileo , about the astronomer whose discoveries put him at odds with the Catholic church, after fleeing from the Nazis in 1933. \nThe second version of his play, shortened to Galileo, was produced the year Brecht was interrogated in 1947 by the House Un-American Activities Committee in the U.S. Artists who refused to cooperate with their interrogations ended up imprisoned. Brecht returned to Germany the next day. \nThe historical Galileo Galilei was a mathematics professor who was born in 1564 in Pisa, Italy. Using a telescope, he made observations that supported Copernicus' idea that the earth revolves around the sun, which contradicted the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. After being threatened with torture and death, Galileo recanted. He was convicted of heresy and died under house arrest in 1642. It took until 1992 for Pope John Paul II to officially acknowledge that Galileo was right. \nThe time seemed right for the play, Owens says, in part because it had been such a long time since the last production, in 1984, at the Dallas Theater Center, directed by then artistic director Adrian Hall. DuBose also seemed increasingly eager to play Galileo. \n\"He has a feeling about the script and he is moving into the right age when he's young enough and old enough. We had the feeling we were on the right track,\" Owens says. \nOwens feels the intimate setting of the 90-seat Undermain that proved so transformational in last year's production of Long Day's Journey Into Night , in which DuBose starred as James Tyrone, could give fresh urgency to Brecht's play. ‘Long Day’s Journey Into Night’ throbs with urgency to understand \nThe script as written can be prohibitive for a small company as it calls for more than three dozen characters in multiple settings. Undermain will simplify the casting with a dozen actors, many playing multiple roles, which DuBose believes can be an asset. \n\"The Dallas Theater Center production was very impressive, but it was very, very big and hard to grasp a lot of the arguments the play was making,\" DuBose says. \nWhile the design is not likely to be as lavish at Undermain, it is innovative, with sets and lighting by Tony Award-winning company member and Dallas native John Arnone, who has proved himself adept at maneuvering around and working with the permanent pillars that keep up the ceiling in the basement venue. \nPlus, Undermain audiences have shown themselves attentive and hungry for the eclectic mix of thoughtful, complex classics and new work the company offers, DuBose says. \n\"The great thing about the Undermain space is that we can bring those discussions very close and can break them down and make them understandable.\" \nPlan your life \nFeb. 8-March 5.
