early enough for the Prime Minister to go back and seek better terms if MPs reject the agreement she has reached, in 2019.\nMs May has insisted a rejection by MPs would see Britain crash out of the EU with no agreement at all, because Westminster will not be allowed to “block Brexit”.\nMr Carmichael said: “I’m looking very carefully at the amendments to ensure that Parliament is given a meaningful debate and decision at the end of the two-year period.\n“I’m very keen for Parliament to have that opportunity to assess and decide on any proposal – or no proposal – that may arise at the end of that two-year period.\n“In short, I’m not going to sign a blank cheque.”\nMr Carmichael, who chairs the education select committee, is the first Article 50-backing Conservative MP to indicate he will rebel on the amendment to secure a “meaningful vote”.\nOthers have hinted they might, having put pressure on the Prime Minister to concede that Parliament must be given a stronger say at the end of the Article 50 process.\nFormer business minister Anna Soubry said, this week: “I want assurances from the government that, in the event of no good deal being reached, all options will be placed before this house, and that we, on behalf of all our constituents and our businesses, will decide what happens next. We may need more time.”\nAnd Dominic Grieve, a former Attorney General said: \"I worry very much that we should have a proper process to help to engage the House and the country in what we're going to do.”\nHowever, Nicky Morgan, the former Education Secretary – and another leading pro-EU Tory – has indicated she will not join any revolt next week. Ken Clarke will vote against triggering Article 50 itself.\nRead more Theresa May says she will publish Brexit plan after Article 50 vote Senior Labour MP warns of riots if MPs fail to trigger Article 50 Could parliament change Britain's Brexit legislation? Labour's Clive Lewis reveals he may still vote against Article 50 bill So far, ministers have refused to say exactly when the crucial vote will take place, or to guarantee it will before the proposals go to the EU Parliament.\nA poll this week found most British people oppose Ms May's “take-it-or-leave-it” threat to leave the EU with no deal, risking an economic crash,\nBefore the referendum, the Treasury forecast that falling back on World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs – the likely consequence of leaving with no deal – would deliver a 7.5 per cent hit to GDP, by 2030.\nOther likely flashpoints next week are over the Prime Minister's refusal to guarantee the rights of 3m EU nationals in the UK and over the planned withdrawal from Euratom, Europe's nuclear power treaty, and the fears it will delay the building of new nuclear power stations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:04:44.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
