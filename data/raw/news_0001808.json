Bey is 35 and her first pregnancy with a single child was difficult, requiring bed rest. \nOur sources say Goldenvoice still has no idea how far along she is, which obviously becomes a factor for the April event. In fact one source says Goldenvoice tried in vain Thursday to reach Bey or her reps. \nA source connected with Beyonce told us the singer still plans to perform, assuming her pregnancy goes well. \nThat said, we're told Goldenvoice is not worried and doesn't feel pressure to find another headliner. We're told the festival was almost sold out before the January 3 lineup was announced. \nAs one source put it, Coachella is fluid in that Goldenvoice \"constantly talks to bands,\" so a replacement won't be difficult if necessary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:24:04.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
