I think we’re all about good business. I’ve done great business with the UFC, with Dana, with everyone. I think it’s smoother if everyone just gets together and we get it involved. But again, everyone’s got to know their place. \n“There’s Mayweather Promotions, there’s the UFC, and now the newly formed McGregor Promotions, and we’re all in the mix. So that’s what I’m saying. \n“Nobody is my boss. I know Floyd likes to say Dana (White) is my boss and this and he decides. Hell no. Nobody decides this. \n“If they let people go fight jiu-jitsu tournaments, they can’t stop me going to fight a boxing fight. So obviously it’s smoother to do it all together but look, everyone’s just got to know their place, and everyone does know their place.” media_camera Floyd Mayweather vs Conor McGregor: Still a pipedream? \nNo - White certainly does not know his place, at least not the place that McGregor is referring to. The UFC president sees his place as McGregor’s contracted promoter and he levelled a threat at his biggest earner after hearing the claim that he could fight Mayweather independently. \n“You know how I feel about Conor. I’ve always shown Conor nothing but respect,” White said at a press conference. “And if he wants to go down that road with us - let me tell ya, it will be an epic fall.” \nBottom line: McGregor would torch his position with the UFC and end up in a nasty legal dispute if he tried to take the Mayweather fight independently. As White said, that call is on him. Yet it may not completely destroy his relationship with the promotion; White is the ultimate pragmatist and likely to do business with whichever fighters can make him money. \nWhite reckons the current likelihood of the Mayweather bout ever happening is: “About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday.” \nIf it does, UFC involvement seems the only reasonable option. That would see McGregor paid from the UFC’s cut, which Mayweather is determined will be smaller than his own; meaning far less than what ‘Money’ gets paid, though McGregor is adamant he’ll get $100 million. \nSo, what happens if the pipedream bout ever gets off the ground? (**List of the current logistical issues at the bottom of the page). A video posted by Conor McGregor Official (@thenotoriousmma) on Feb 8, 2017 at 9:56am PST \nIn McGregor’s professional boxing debut, he would be a 100-1 chance against an unbeaten legend who is 49-0, with scalps including Oscar De La Hoya, Shane Mosley, Canelo Alvarez and Manny Pacquiao. \nIt’s a near-guaranteed loss - no big deal in itself, provided he doesn’t suffer an embarrassing knockout or an utter humiliation from a speed and technique standpoint. A respectable loss against the master boxer will only add to his reputation as a daring fighter; a freakish win will send his fame and popularity to insane levels. \nBut what the logistical nightmare of making the fight ultimately means is time. Drawn-out, idle time. A year or more of the 28-year-old McGregor’s prime, for a novelty fight that (outside the obscene payday) means nothing, which will need to be propped up with a year’s worth of ‘Notorious’ style media gimmicks that even he will struggle to keep fresh. media_camera Floyd Mayweather Jr: Unbeaten at 49-0. \nMcGregor has indicated that he’s willing to sit and wait for just about as long as it takes: “By the end of this year or early next year.” \n“I’ll tell you what, for $100 million, I’ll sit for another year,” McGregor said. \n“I’m twitching (from inactivity) sometimes but f*** it, this is historic. Fighting Khabib what-the-f***-his-name-is (Nurmagomedov), Tony Donkey (Ferguson), Jose (Aldo), even (Tyron) Woodley for the third (title), it’s not this. Sometimes you’ve got to be patient with situations and I feel this is one of them. \n“Plus, the situation around me, Dee (his partner) is about to have a baby, I’m looking forward to that. I’m in a different mindset right now, so I’m happy. Everything seems to just be working perfectly for me, so a little bit of wait is not too bad. I’m OK with it this time, for now.” \nThe time factor has pros and cons. As Mayweather exploited with the Pacquiao fight, ‘will it, won’t it’ suspense for the fight taking place builds interest and potential viewers. McGregor has also fought six times in the past two years, so a layoff (within reason) may do him good. \nThe cons are potentially serious for McGregor, related to what comes next. media_camera Conor McGregor weighs-in for UFC 205. \nTHE UFC COMEBACK \nThe potential Mayweather fight date would mean a return to the UFC in early 2018 at best - a gap of more than a year since ‘The Notorious’ claimed the lightweight title at UFC 205. \nThat would make the greatest criticism of McGregor - that he is unwilling, perhaps even fearful, to defend his titles - white hot. As it stands, he has never defended a UFC belt despite having held one non-stop since he won the featherweight strap in December 2015. \nNurmagomedov vs Ferguson will take place at UFC 209 (March 5 AEDT) for the interim lightweight championship. Should McGregor be absent this entire year and into 2018, the winner would surely be elevated to full champion, then await the Irishman in his return fight (meaning he’d still be yet to defend). \nThis is where the true risks come in. \nMcGregor would not have fought in the Octagon for well over a year and would be coming back against a monster, should it be Nurmagomedov or Ferguson. Both are decorated wrestlers who love to ground-and-pound - not great match-ups for the ground-shy McGregor. media_camera Khabib Nurmagomedov. \nThe critical result of his time away from MMA would not just be rust, but also the lack of specific training. Before winning his rematch against Nate Diaz and toppling Eddie Alvarez, McGregor loaded up on jiu-jitsu training; most of all, his takedown defence, which kept him standing virtually the entire time in both fights. He would need to work incredibly hard on his boxing to avoid humiliation against Mayweather, meaning a huge period in which he is not focused on further addressing his grappling weaknesses. \nSimply put, Nurmagomedov/Ferguson would be a fight he could easily lose. And it would not be a fight he could avoid, as it would make him indefensible to the perception that he ducks dangerous opponents as suits him. \nA loss would not only diminish his standing, it would impact the blockbuster nature of the only UFC fight he really cares about: The Diaz trilogy match. media_camera Tony Ferguson. \nMCGREGOR vs DIAZ III \nDespite White’s insistence that it won’t happen, McGregor wants that trilogy fight badly and simple economics (the first two fights were believed to be No.1 and No.2 as the most watched pay-per-views in UFC history) say that it will take place. \n‘The Notorious’ also wants McGregor vs Diaz III to be for the lightweight title, to ensure the stakes and the interest are as high as possible. \nWhat is the trilogy fight with McGregor coming off a loss, with no title belt? Still big but nowhere near as massive as it would be should he go in as champion, having beaten Nurmagomedov/Ferguson to further smash the theories of his critics. At its best, it could prove a payday exceeding $20 million (the amount Diaz is optimistically demanding). \nFrom a fighting perspective, this is the worst case, and entirely possible, scenario: He’s coming into this bout off two defeats, then loses again. Not due to rust or distraction this time, simply because he an Diaz have proven so evenly matched. media_camera McGregor vs Diaz II: Incredibly close. \nDiaz already believes he’s 2-0 vs McGregor; when a majority decision was announced for the Irishman in the Octagon at UFC 202, his immediate query to his corner was, “What the f***?” \nDiaz holds the balance of power over the two fights. He rocked McGregor with a shot flush on the jaw and completed a Round 2 rear naked choke submission to win the first fight at UFC 196, then survived five damaging rounds to snatch a draw on one scorecard in the rematch; never looking like he would be knocked out. \nMcGregor managed to stay off the ground for virtually the entire fight at UFC 202, something he’d be hard-pressed to repeat over another five rounds. Diaz’s jiu-jitsu would be an ever-present threat to a fighter unlikely to ever be a great ground exponent. And Diaz has shown he is just as much of a threat with his punching, even if McGregor can inflict more consistent damage. \nDiaz is holding out for the fight, too - he not only rejected an offer from the UFC to fight fallen LW champ Alvarez, he laughed it off. He wants only McGregor. And he wants revenge. Lol at your fight... — Nathan Diaz (@NateDiaz209) February 4, 2017 \nBottom line: After facing Mayweather, Nurmagomedov/Ferguson and Diaz, McGregor could be left as an 0-3 fighter over the past 18 months, with his UFC title lost largely due to his pursuit of the MMA vs boxing novelty fight. He could also have finished on the wrong side of his great rivalry with Diaz, forever on the wrong side of the considerable bragging rights. He would have plenty of money to comfort him but his megastardom would be hugely damaged - perhaps ruined if he suffered comprehensive losses in his UFC return. He would still be just on 30 (DOB: July 14, 1988), with plenty of time to resurrect his career, but with a long road back to claim his crown as king of the UFC. media_camera Conor McGregor: Current king playing a high-stakes game. \n*** \n**LOGISTICAL ISSUES STANDING BETWEEN MCGREGOR vs MAYWEATHER \nNo.1: McGregor will need to settle his beef (an outstanding fine for the UFC 202 press conference fiasco) with the Nevada State Athletic Commission in order to get a boxing licence, having been refused upon his first application. Mayweather’s last 14 fights, spanning a decade, have all taken place in Las Vegas and fighting there is a likely sticking point for ‘Money’. \nNo.2: An athletic commission, be it in Nevada or elsewhere, needs to sanction the fight. A string of fight experts - including Dana White and Dan Rafael - have previously said the idea of a sanctioned boxing match between a legend and a debutant was dangerous and unlikely to happen. In denying McGregor, the NSAC said it was not comfortable granting the MMA star a combat licence in a “different sport”. \nNo.3: Promotion ownership needs to be decided. Both the UFC and Mayweather would jostle to be the sole promoter, as is their wont, but they would need to somehow arrive at an uneasy co-promotion truce. That would take an incredible amount of negotiating, mostly due to the next point. Then there’s the newly-created McGregor Promotions. McGregor wants to be an equal partner in this event, rather than a UFC employee. \nNo.4: The big one: The money. Who gets the split of potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. Mayweather will demand the lion’s share, as he always has, something neither the UFC or McGregor will abide. And McGregor will want to be paid as a genuine partner, not a UFC employee who gets a Dana White-determined fraction of the revenue. \nNo.5: Weight. While McGregor has fought between 145 and 170 pounds (65-77kg), the heaviest Mayweather has ever fought at is 151 pounds (68kg). Mayweather took his last four fights at 147 pounds. McGregor is loathe to go back to fighting at the bottom end of his scale, which required a brutal weight cut, while Mayweather would not want to fight too heavy. There would be serious jostling over the official fight weight, with neither man wanting to concede a significant advantage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:19:25.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
