The victim was heard saying to Varadharajan: “I love you” and “I want to be your wife”. They had also talked about getting married once the victim, then a nursing student, completed her studies.\n“I didn’t know the consequences. I was young and immature. I was 19. Everyone makes mistakes (at that age)”, she said in court. “So what if I said all those things to him? (He had) no right to injure me ... I will be going through this for life. Every day I’m looking at the scar.”\nShe suffered over 20 knife wounds on her head, neck, chest and abdomen. A deep cut to her neck left her with permanent facial nerve damage and a 20cm-long scar that runs from the top of her left ear down to her neck.\n\nThe woman said Varadharajan had shouted “Die!” as he stabbed her, and told her: “If I can’t have you, no man should have you.”\n\nATTACKER INTENDED TO KILL HIMSELF: DEFENCE \nDefence lawyer Rengarajoo Rengasamy Balasamy told the court that Varadharajan wanted to kill himself the day he stabbed the victim.\n\nAccording to Varadharajan, his intentions were made known to the victim as she came out of the lift. Her phone rang and Varadharajan began to cry when he saw a picture of her with another man.\n\nVaradharajan claimed the victim then kissed him and assured him that she wanted to marry him but said her parents were not supportive.\n\nThe victim disputed Varadharajan’s version of events.\n\nThe defence also accused her of sending similar “love messages” to other men, which she denied. She also refuted claims that she invited Varadharajan to her house and performed sexual acts on him.\nThe trial will continue at a later date.\n- CNA/gs\nEmail More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T13:39:08.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
