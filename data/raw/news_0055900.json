Now there's yet another way to share what you're doing with people you know: WhatsApp Status.\nLaunched on Monday, the feature lets you share photos, videos, and GIFs with all your contacts at once. From the recently redesigned WhatsApp camera app, you can personalize media with emoji, text, and drawings.\nWhen you open the new Status tab, you'll see updates from people in your WhatsApp address book. Like on rival platforms, these updates will expire after 24 hours. You can control who sees what you share, and mute or unmute contacts at any time. After viewing someone's status, you can reply to that person privately, if you so choose.\nThe new WhatsApp Status feature started rolling out to users on Monday and will be available soon around the world for iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone users.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:39:50.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
