Staffers quickly come around to confiscate them. pic.twitter.com/YhPpkwFCNc\n— Peter Hamby (@PeterHamby) February 24, 2017 Maybe they were a gift from President Putin?\nDuring President Donald Trump's address Friday to the Conservative Political Action Conference, fans in the crowd waved tiny red, white and blue flags with the name TRUMP in white letters as they cheered.\nPresident Donald Trump got a heroes welcome at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington Friday, an event he skipped during the 2016 election year. (Feb. 24)\nMedia: MediaOS Video There was only one problem — the flag was a tricolor with the white on top, blue in the middle and red on bottom — exactly the same as the Russian national flag — without the Trump branding, of course.\nEvidently, someone at CPAC with international-flag knowledge noticed the similarity and ordered officials to come around and collect the flags. Waving Russian flags in front of a president suspected of shady connections and possibly unsavory deals with Russia does not look good.", "external_links": ["https://t.co/YhPpkwFCNc", "https://twitter.com/PeterHamby/status/835150821411143682"], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:05:51.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
