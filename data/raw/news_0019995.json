Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mother was forced to give birth on the floor of a jail cell after being arrested for a first time driving offence - because prison guards didn't believe she was in labour. Jessica Preston, 27, was eight months pregnant when she was held at Macomb County Jail in Detroil, Michigan last March for driving on a suspended licence. She was thrown behind bars because she could not afford her $10,000 cash bond, and had been expected to stay in the cell for five days while awaiting a court date. On the fifth day, she went into labour, and told medical staff at the prison that she was about to give birth - but they didn't believe her and denied her a trip to hospital. Instead, Ms Preston - whose licence had been suspended due to an unpaid parking ticket - was forced to welcome her son Elijah a month early on a dirty mattress pad.

The mother is now planning to launch legal action against the prison for their treatment of her, with the baby's father Thomas Chastain describing what happened as 'disgraceful'. “How could they let that happen?” Mr Chastain told The Detroit News. “How would they feel if it was their mother, sister, cousin, aunt? \"It shouldn’t have happened. She should have been sent to the hospital to have that baby.” Read More Court defendants no longer get a cup of coffee before appearing in dock - because 'caffeine makes them hyperactive' \nPrison officials claim that after Ms Preston told them she was in labour, medical staff were called over to carry out checks. But after looking her over, she was sent back to her cell as they did not believe her. It was only when she started giving birth that officers were on the phone to a doctor, but which point it was too late to send her to hospital.

It’s not right. It’s inhumane.

In July 2013, Jennifer Meyers died of sepsis while serving a 30-day sentence for failing to pay child support. Less than a year later, David Stojcevski died inside the jail. He had lost nearly 50 pounds in 17 days and died due to withdrawal from doctor-prescribed medication.
