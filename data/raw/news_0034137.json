The video has gone viral, with the ex-girlfriend getting dubbed #HurtBae and the ex-boyfriend meeting the collective wrath of the entire internet. Truly, hell hath no fury like the Twitterverse scorned. \nIn the video (produced by CondĂŠ Nast Entertainment), former couple Kourtney and Leonard sit across from each other and discuss their relationship. They start by describing how they met and eventually became close friends â but the conversation quickly turns to their relationship and Leonardâs cheating. Kourtney recounts finding evidence of his cheating on his phone, and recalls finding Leonard actually with someone once in his bedroom. When she asks how many times he cheated on her, his answer speaks volumes: âI donât knowâŚ. I wasnât counting.â \nEeesh . \nI think that one reason this video has gone viral is that it taps into a feeling that so many of us have had â the intense desire to go back to an ex who has hurt us, ask the questions we wish weâd have asked, and say the things we wished weâd have said. Often breakups themselves are so painful and messy that itâs easy to end up on the other side of one and feel like you never actually got to hash things out. At least Kourtney has gotten to talk about it, and perhaps find some closure. He cheated on her. Now she wants to know why. pic.twitter.com/5hdlpKisjZ Source: The Scene on Twitter \nIn the video, Kourtney tells Leonard that she has forgiven him (Why? âBecause youâre my best friend,â she says brokenly. SOB). The internet, however, is not so forgiving, and the reaction from Twitter has been intense. In the two days since The Scene posted the video, itâs gotten nearly 310,000 âlikesâ â and the response seems to be primarily a mix of sympathy and vicarious rage. \nSome people are heartbroken on Kourtney's behalf: HE DID NOT DESERVE HER! SHE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT AND HE DIDNT CARE ABOUT HER. HE WAS HER BEST FRIEND & SHE STILL GOT TREATED SO BAD #hurtbae pic.twitter.com/lbEFYbikbF ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:33:26.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
