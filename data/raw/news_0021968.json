Earlier, Ewing and Gormley filmed at Ormiston Gorge, a spectacular mountain-ringed water hole. This is a world away from the over-lit, flimsy-walled soaps of the 1970s. \n\"I don't want to put down our competitor that shoots in Melbourne,\" Ewing says, \"but look at us out here. The team do such a good job of keeping the show relevant and fresh. Dramas come and go, but Home and Away is the little engine that could.\" \nWe arrive on set mid-morning, but the cast have been filming since dawn. Today's scenes are tough: fistfights, rescue attempts, hostile interrogations. All beneath the Northern Territory sun. Supplied \nAda Nicodemou has been through all sorts of scrapes during her 16 years on Home & Away. \nEvery week, Home and Away shoots the equivalent of a feature film's worth of footage. This past year, it filled 44 weeks. \"Those hours are something I'm grateful I went through, because everything else seems like a walk in the park,\" Ewings says. He and Gormley left Summer Bay in 2014, but have returned for the specials and a recent stint on the main show. \n\"It's a well-oiled machine,\" Gormley adds, noting this leaves little room for big egos. \"The crew works harder than you'll ever work, full stop. No matter how crappy or tired you're feeling, you just shut up and do your bit.\" \nAfter filming the dramatic finale, Flanagan catches her breath. On the strength of her acclaimed work in Redfern Now and The Gods of Wheat Street , producers offered her a role – no audition necessary. \"I've been wanting to work on Home and Away for a long time,\" Flanagan says. \"For an indigenous actor to get into mainstream television is a big deal, and I'm proud to have done it.\" Supplied \nRay Meagher, who plays Alf Stewart, is Home and Away's only original cast member. \nOver lunch, Flanagan and I recall whole plotlines from the early 90s, many involving Alf (Ray Meagher, the only original cast member) and Irene (played by Lynne McGranger since 1993). Bobby Fisher's (Nicolle Dickson) death in a boating accident, she says, \"stuck with me\". Ad Feedback \nEwing recalls viewers sending his infant son gifts in 2014, when his family was in Ireland. It was a bounty too large to bring home, so he donated the teddies and baby clothes to charities. And Gormley remembers the letters she received when Bianca lost her baby to SIDS; women sharing their own heartbreaking experiences. \"We cover these stories quickly, but they do give people hope because they see themselves on screen,\" she says. \nIt's no accident Home and Away 's first episode was rewritten by Bevan Lee, who returned multiple times over the years. Lee also created or wrote other Seven \"heartland\" hits: Sons and Daughters , All Saints , Always Greener , Packed to the Rafters , Winners and Losers , and A Place to Call Home . SUPPLIED \nPictured in 1988 are Home & Away stars L-R Sharyn Hodgson as Carly, Roger Oakley as Tom, Nicolle Dickson as Bobby, Vanessa Downing as Pippa, Helena Bozich as Lynn, Alex Papps as Frank, Adam Willits as Steven & Kate Ritchie as Sally. \nNo network likes a flop. In retrospect, however, Seven must be thrilled Neighbours fizzled upon its 1985 debut (though it rated well in Melbourne). So the network axed it – then set fire to the sets, to deter any rival considering a relaunch. Undaunted, Ten rebuilt Ramsay Street's interiors and made the show a hit. A despairing Seven began searching for another weeknight soap. \nInspiration struck then-drama chief, Alan Bateman, when he stopped for icecream during a family holiday. Bateman began chatting with locals in the small New South Wales town of Kangaroo Point. Many were livid over the construction of a foster home, lest its needy children befoul their riverside hideaway. \n\"I saw then the outline for a serial,\" Bateman recalled in the book Home and Away: Behind the Scenes . \"Nobody wanted them to move in ... and I began to wonder how streetwise city kids would adapt to the new lifestyle.\" YouTube \nIn this classic scene, Alf is angered by the recent treatment towards him by Penn and tries to have a fight with him. \nDebuting as a telemovie in January 1988, Home and Away drew a healthy audience. But ratings soon dropped – not helped by different timeslots in different states – and it was \"touch and go\", writes TV historian Andrew Mercado in Super Aussie Soaps. Had Seven swung the axe, it would have killed one of its most important shows of the past three decades. \n\"I watched as a young fella in New Zealand for the beautiful beaches and beautiful women,\" says George Mason, fresh from filming an argument between Kyle (Nate Cooper) and Heath. \"But [you keep watching] because of the good writing; it's got a bit of action, a bit of everything.\" \nA decade ago, Neighbours strayed too far into Melrose Place territory, admitting to an excess of \"bombs, guns and stalkers\". This forced a swing back to more family-focused drama. Home and Away , in contrast, has always balanced cliffhanger calamities with more common life dramas. \nAs many have pointed out, its cast is overdue for greater ethnic and sexual diversity. \"I'd move interstate for them if they wanted me to,\" Flanagan says, confirming she'd jump at a permanent role. \"I think Home and Away has a lot of good things yet to come.\" \nHome & Away 5.30pm, weeknights, TVNZ2. - Fairfax Media Australia", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:17:53.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
