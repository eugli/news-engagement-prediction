So despite the incessant, swirling speculation about his future, the stoic Frenchman is taking a no-frills, business-as-usual approach. In other words, winning football matches (against Sutton), assessing his squad and building for next season. And according to the Sun , Wenger has weighed everything up and reached the conclusion that, going forward, what the Gunners really need is an another attacking midfielders/striker. [READ MORE: Arsenal forward backtracks on exit claims] The tabloid reports that Arsenal’s “number one transfer target” this summer will be Lorenzo Insigne, the 25-year-old Italian who has notched eight goals and six assists in Serie A for Napoli this season. Gunners scouts watched Insigne score against Chievo at the weekend and were said to be duly impressed, although Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis is apparently “demanding nothing less than an astronomical £44m” for the player. The story concludes with the suggestion that this sum “could deter Arsenal from making an offer”. So, basically, we just read all that for nothing. Someone the Gunners could probably afford, and will be encouraged to bid for, is Manchester City’s Joe Hart. The Times reports that City have decided the England goalkeeper will be allowed to join a “top-six rival” this summer – Pep Guardiola evidently having decided that he poses no threat to their title hopes by playing for another club. City will be “seeking more than £20m” for Hart, which seems optimistic when everyone knows that Pep would sooner put himself in goals than trust the Torino loanee between the sticks. The transfer story that keeps on giving, namely Barcelona’s pursuit of a new right-back that has previously seen them linked with such luminaries as Glen Johnson and Alan Hutton (probably), takes us today to the slightly more plausible Cedric Soares. The Telegraph says the Southampton man is “on Barca’s radar”, but he’ll probably just end up going to Liverpool like all their other players. Hull City defender Harry Maguire looks set to have a busy summer, with the Star reporting that Tottenham have joined Everton and Southampton in tracking the in-form 23-year-old. Elsewhere, West Ham are interested in St Etienne defender Kevin Malcuit ( Sun ) and Real Sociedad striker Willian Jose ( Calciomercato ), Lucas Perez’s agent has pulled a “dramatic U-turn” by insisting the striker wants to play for Arsenal, hours after saying he was desperate to leave ( Star ) and Galatasaray winger Bruma has expressed a desire to join “Barcelona, Real Madrid or Manchester United” ( Express ). Carlton Cole subsequently did the same – worth a try innit. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:43:32.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
