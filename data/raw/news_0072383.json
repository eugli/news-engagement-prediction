Wire (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) \nAs protests spread over policy announcements from the Trump administration, Democrats must work to encourage participation in politics, but face a danger of the party becoming too radicalized, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank) said Tuesday. \n“The radical nature of this government is radicalizing Democrats, and that’s going to pose a real challenge to the Democratic Party, which is to draw on the energy and the activism and the passion that is out there, but not let it turn us into what we despised about the tea party,\" Schiff said. \nDuring a meeting with reporters and editors in the Los Angeles Times' Washington bureau, Schiff also discussed his role as the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Select Intelligence Committee under a Trump administration and how Democrats will manage in the minority. \nEver since the election, party leaders have been debating: \"Did we lose because we were too far to the left and we had too small a tent, or did we lose because we are too mainstream and didn’t energize the base?\" Schiff asked. \n\"We are obviously having that debate, but there’s a whole new element, which is the reaction to the Trump administration that makes this different in kind, certainly different in intensity, than I think we’ve ever seen after an election,” he said. \n“The more radical the administration is, the more radicalized our base becomes, which just feeds the Breitbart crowd, and who knows where that ends.” \nDemocratic leaders have to channel public reaction to Trump's actions into progress, rather than deadlock, Schiff said. \nReaction to Democrats seen as working with the Trump administration has been strong. Monday night, for example, protesters marched on Sen. Dianne Feinstein's home and office voicing fears she would back Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general. The senator from California announced Tuesday that she would oppose Sessions. \nSeveral groups calling themselves \"indivisible\" have popped up in cities across the country as focal points for efforts to organize. \n“We have two of the most capable strategists as the head of our House and Senate Democrats,\" Schiff added, referring to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco and Senate Democratic leader Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York. \n\"If anybody can grapple with this, they can, but it’s going to be a challenging and moving target day to day.\" \n\"I just hope that we can channel that energy in a way where we can provide a check on this administration because I’ve never been more worried about the country’s future than I am right now,\" he said. \nSchiff said part of his role as the ranking Democrat on the House Select Intelligence Committee will be pushing back when the Trump administration puts out inaccurate information about the intelligence community and its findings. \nTrump has repeatedly dismissed or sought to minimize the intelligence community's findings that Russia sought to intervene in the 2016 election to benefit him . Schiff said he’s concerned about what else the administration might be willing to dismiss. \n“I think that will be kind of a new frontier,” he said. “How do we contradict a president making representations about what the intelligence community has to say when the information is classified?” Jan. 31, 2017, 11:00 a.m. reporting from washington Noah Bierman \"This is not a ban,\" spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters in a fiery news briefing. (Alex Wong / Getty Images) \nPresident Trump used the word \"ban\" in a tweet as recently as Monday to describe his new executive order suspending travel from seven Muslim-majority countries and halting the refugee program for several months. \nBut facing backlash from many directions, the White House adamantly insisted Tuesday that the word is verboten. \n\"This is not a ban,\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters in a fiery news briefing. \n\"When we use words like 'travel ban,'\" he said later, \"that misrepresents what it is. It's seven countries previously identified by the Obama administration, where, frankly, we don't get the information that we need for people coming into this country.\" \nIn fact, people from the seven banned countries — Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Libya — cannot enter the United States under the order. Spicer appeared to be making a renewed effort to distinguish the order from the all-out ban on Muslims entering the country that Trump proposed during the campaign. \nMany around the world see the newest policy as an outgrowth of that proposal. \nTrump himself conceded a religious connection when he said in an interview on Friday that he wanted to make it easier for Syrian Christians to enter the country. And former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani told Fox News that the order sprang from a group he formed at Trump's request to create a legal framework that would accomplish the campaign goal of a \"Muslim ban.\" \nBut amid confusion and worldwide criticism in recent days, the Trump administration has tried to temper some of the more incendiary rhetoric around the proposal. \nEven the words \"extreme vetting,\" a favorite Trump slogan, were called into question by Spicer on Tuesday. \n\"Calling for tougher vetting [of] individual travelers from seven nations is not extreme,\" he said. \"It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country.\" \nBut changing the ban branding around the program at this point will be difficult. Here's Trump's tweet from Monday: \nAnd Spicer himself used the term ban as recently as Sunday: Immigration White House Jan. 31, 2017, 11:16 a.m. Reporting from Washington Brian Bennett \nThe Trump administration doubled down Tuesday on its commitment to transforming the nation’s border law enforcement, signaling that some of the temporary bans on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries are likely to be made permanent and elevating a deportations official to run the top immigration enforcement agency. \nAdministration officials, led by newly sworn-in Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly , moved to allay the havoc that marked the roll-out of the ban and another on refugees. They briefed reporters and planned to head to Capitol Hill later today in an apparent effort to smooth relations after reports that lawmakers and other stakeholders were left out of the crafting of the executive order on toughened vetting at border entry points. \nIn a news conference, Kelly and other top Homeland Security officials conceded some problems, including poor communication. But they insisted that all court orders were followed over the weekend, rebutted reports that some legal residents were denied access to attorneys at airports and said they everyone detained by border agents was treated with \"dignity and respect.\" \n“The vast majority of the 1.7 billion Muslims that live on this planet, the vast majority of them have, all other things being equal, have access to the United States,” Kelly told reporters. “And a relatively small number right now are being held up for a period of time until we can take a look at what their procedures are,” he said, seeming to acknowledge that mostly Muslims have been affected by the ban. \nThe moves signaled that the White House remained committed to remaking border law enforcement even in the face of widespread confusion and condemnation of President Trump’s order. \nKelly said for the first time that the some of the restrictions that caused confusion and sparked protests over the weekend could be extended well into the future. \n\"Some of those countries that are currently on the list may not be taken off the list anytime soon,\" he said. \nTrump also named a longtime deportation officer, Thomas D. Homan, as acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nHoman, who will oversee the execution of Trump’s immigration enforcement order, was most recently in charge of the agency’s 5,000 deportation officers, a force Trump said he would triple to 15,000. \nTrump's orders put a greater emphasis on deporting not only those convicted of crimes, but also people in the country illegally who were charged with crimes not yet adjudicated, those who receive an improper welfare benefit and even those who have not been charged but are believed to have committed \"acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense.\" Congress Jan. 31, 2017, 10:32 a.m. Senate confirms Elaine Chao as secretary of Transportation Associated Press Elaine Chao testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee on Jan. 11, 2017. (Zach Gibson / AP) \nThe Senate has confirmed Elaine Chao to serve as Transportation secretary in the Trump administration. The vote was 93 to 6 on Tuesday. \nChao is an experienced Washington hand. She was Labor secretary under President George W. Bush and is the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \nChao would be a lead actor in pursuing Trump's promise to invest $1 trillion to improve highways, rail service and other infrastructure projects. Jan. 31, 2017, 9:43 a.m. Reporting from Washington Lisa Mascaro \nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Tuesday stood by President Trump's temporary ban on refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations and indicated that he was confident the administration could fix the \"confusing\" rollout without action from Congress. \n\"What is happening is something we support,\" said Ryan, whose office was the target of a sit-in by protesters opposed to Trump's order. \"We need to pause and we need to make sure that the vetting standards are up to snuff so we can guarantee the safety and security of our country.\" \nCongress was blindsided by Trump's executive action -- Ryan learned about it as the public did when the White House announced it Friday afternoon. Many GOP lawmakers have raised concerns. \nDuring a private meeting in the Capitol basement Tuesday, Republican lawmakers were counseled on how to handle protesters and office sit-ins happening across the country. \n\"It’s regrettable that there was some confusion on the rollout of this,\" Ryan said. \"No one wanted to see people with green cards or special immigrant visas, like translators, get caught up in all of this.\" \nRyan also said he was concerned the ban could be used as propaganda by terrorist groups. \n\"The rhetoric surrounding this could be used as a recruiting tool, and I think that's dangerous,\" he said. \nStill, Republicans leaders as well as rank-and-file GOP lawmakers largely agreed with the president's move to halt refugee admissions for 120 days, and to temporarily ban citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries, unless they are Christians or other religious minorities. \n\"The president was well within his right to issue an executive order,\" said Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), chairman of the House Rules Committee. \n\"Do I feel let out? I feel like everybody was left out,\" he said. \"I wish they communicated it. I wish they had gotten more information to people. I wish they had measured three times and sawed once.\" \nLawmakers have shown little appetite for Congress to get involved, and suggested the chaos that erupted at airports over the weekend was just part of a learning curve at the White House. \n“I support the thrust of the executive order,\" said Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.), who nevertheless said the administration should have been better prepared and will need to \"get your act together.\" \nLast year, Ryan had strongly condemned Trump's campaign-trail call for a Muslim ban. \nIn recent days, Ryan, like other congressional leaders, was forced to dial up the administration with his questions and concerns about the order, conferring Monday with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. \n\"I am very pleased and confident that he is, on a going-forward basis, going to make sure that things are done correctly,\" Ryan said. \nPressed on whether Congress would have a role, Ryan did not indicate any immediate legislative action.
