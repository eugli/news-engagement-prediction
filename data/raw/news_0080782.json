Shooting guard Avery Bradley currently is Boston’s leading rebounder averaging 6.9 boards per contest. \nIf the C’s do want to sign Bogut, however, they would have to waive a player since their roster currently sits at 15 players. \nBogut has averaged 10 points, 8.9 rebounds and 1.6 blocks over his 12-year NBA career. \nThumbnail photo via Kevin Jairaj/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:02:21.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
