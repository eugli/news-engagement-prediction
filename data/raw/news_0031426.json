(ROMAOSLO/Getty Images/Vetta) Saturday, February 11, 2017, 8:57 PM \nBow wow ow! \nA dog took a bullet for his best friend — and survived — after a trio of robbers jumped his master in Brooklyn, officials said Saturday. \nThe pooch’s 26-year-old owner was walking on Eastern Parkway near Troy Ave. in Crown Heights when the three muggers ran up to him about 4 a.m. on Friday. \nWhen one of the suspects pulled a gun, the dog yelped, startling the crook, officials said. \nThe jumpy gunman fired off one round, hitting the dog in the lower back. \nAs the dog reeled in pain, the muggers stole the victim’s cell phone and ran off, officials said. \nCops were still looking for the crooks Saturday night. \nThe wounded dog was taken to an ASPCA facility, where a vet treated the animal — and removed the bullet for police to examine as evidence, a spokeswoman said.
