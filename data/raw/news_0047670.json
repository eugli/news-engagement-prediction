NATO allies have promised to reach the goal of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense by 2024, but only five countries currently meet that figure. Germany, for instance, which has Europe’s largest economy, currently spends only 1.2 percent of GDP on defense, though it increased spending by some 8 percent last year. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Pence said pointedly that while some NATO members met the spending goal, “many others, including some of our largest allies, still lack a credible path.” Mr. Trump, he said, “expects allies to meet that goal. For most that means the time has come to do more.” Applause for Mr. Pence’s speech was thin. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who spoke before the vice president, had argued that increases in military spending must be gradual to be efficient and effective. Mrs. Merkel said that spending on other matters — like development aid, education for girls and women, and caring for refugees — also contributes to mutual security, as do stronger multilateral institutions like the European Union and the United Nations, which Mr. Trump has criticized. Europe needs the support of the United States in the face of Islamist terrorism and Russian ambition, Mrs. Merkel said, promising to continue to spend more to meet NATO goals. “We need the military strength of the United States,” she said. But she warned against nationalism, without specifically mentioning Mr. Trump’s “America First” philosophy. “Will we be able to continue working well together, or will we all fall back into our individual roles?” she asked. “Let’s make the world better together, and then it will be better for each of us.” Ms. Merkel is facing a re-election campaign in September in which the extent of increased defense spending is already a hot political issue, as is her handling of the influx of refugees into Europe. Mr. Pence’s message, which was similar to that offered in Munich this week by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis , appeared to have done little to reassure Europeans who think that making NATO commitments conditional on spending undermines the credibility and deterrence of the alliance. “American government officials need to go back to Washington recognizing that there are serious concerns in Europe, especially in Germany, about a host of issues from trade to foreign policy and NATO,” said Steven E. Sokol, president of the American Council on Germany. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.
