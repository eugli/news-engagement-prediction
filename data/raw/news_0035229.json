The main figures behind Nexia BT have declined the invitation to appear before the committee \nDr Mizzi’s last-minute decision to attend Monday’s meeting with the 16-member-strong MEP delegation has led to some changes in the committee’s programme, which will now also include a hearing with Manfred Galdes, the former FIAU boss and Finance Minister Edward Scicluna. \nPolice Commissioner Lawrence Cutajar and the Tax Compliance Unit are also scheduled to appear before the committee. The EP’s Panama Committee yesterday sent written questions to Nexia BT – the financial advisory firm that made the necessary arrangements for Dr Mizzi and Mr Schembri to open their companies in Panama. Both Brian Tonna and Kurt Cini – the main figures behind Nexia BT – have turned down an invitation to appear before the committee but said they would be ready to reply to questions in writing. \nThe Panama committee has sent its questions to Nexia BT with an emphasis on the third Panamanian company opened at the same time as the ones opened for Dr Mizzi and Mr Schembri. \nThe MEPs asked Nexia BT to say who is the beneficial owner of Egrant – the third company – and to state whether the owner is also a PEP. MEPs also want to know why Nexia BT chose to send the details of the beneficiary owner of Egrant through a Skype call instead of through e-mails as in the case of the two Maltese PEPs. \nThe Panama committee asked Mr Tonna – the managing partner of Nexia BT – to explain his relationship with Keith Schembri and Mr Schembri’s private business, the Kasco Group. \nHe was also asked whether it was true that he had a desk at the office of the Prime Minster and whether he thought that there was a conflict of interest, given that “he has been in business with the Prime Minister’s chief of staff”. \nIt has been established that despite opening a trust in New Zealand and a company in Panama, both Dr Mizzi and the Prime Minister’s chief of staff failed to notify, as obliged by law, the local tax authorities of their overseas financial vehicles. « Three of every four people who drowned in Malta last year were foreign Malta votes for its Eurovision song tonight » Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=18606060883&n=815e08ad' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=18606060883&n=815e08ad' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
