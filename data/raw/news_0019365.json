The sheriff, one of the top officials in a county about 25 miles east of Dallas, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. \nAdvertisement   The state senator who represents Rockwall County, Bob Hall, a Republican, also did not respond to requests for comment. According to The Texas Tribune, Mr. Hall told reporters on Tuesday at the state Capitol in Austin that he had “no idea” if he was the senator the sheriff was referring to, but said he had a “very good relationship” with the sheriff. Mr. Hall is a member of the Senate committee on veteran affairs and border security, and is a decorated Air Force veteran who worked as an engineer on the Minuteman missile-defense system during the Cold War. Texas state senators and representatives reacted to Mr. Trump’s remark along party lines. Republicans, who control both chambers of the State Legislature, described Mr. Trump’s comment as a joke. Democrats, however, said they were shocked that the president of the United States would speak so flippantly about destroying a lawmaker’s career. State Senator Jos é Mené ndez , a Democrat from San Antonio, wrote a proposed resolution condemning Mr. Trump’s comment. The resolution, which was filed but had not been voted on, states that when the president “threatens any member of the Texas Senate, it must be considered a threat to all Texas senators,” and it calls on Mr. Trump “to refrain from threatening elected officials.” Both of the senators who filed bills in the Texas Legislature to restrict how and when property can be seized by law enforcement denied they were the ones whom the sheriff had been referring to. One of them, Konni Burton, a Republican, said she disagreed with the sheriff’s comments about overhauling asset forfeiture, and said the incident would not discourage her from pursuing passage of her bill , which requires conviction before assets can be seized. “Do not be mistaken or misled: This is not strictly a law enforcement issue,” Ms. Burton said in a statement. “This is a property rights issue. Property rights are one of the foundational rights in any free society, and the taking of property by government is no small matter.’’ “Requiring the government to secure a criminal conviction before permanently taking property from citizens is simply common sense,” she said.
