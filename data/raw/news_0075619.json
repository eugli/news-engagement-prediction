During their interview, Seacrest revealed a pre-recorded message from the “Hamilton” cast in honor of Miranda’s Oscar nomination for Best Original Song for “How Far I’ll Go.” \nSeacrest then asked the “Hamilton” creator to send a message back to the cast. \n“I hate you for making me cry before the Oscars have even started,” he responded. “That was amazing. Thank you. Thank you for that. That’s incredible.” Kevin Mazur via Getty Images A . \nAnd it wouldn’t be a Hollywood red carpet without a nod to the current political climate. Miranda, like several stars, arrived on the red carpet wearing a blue ACLU ribbon in solidarity with the American Civil Liberties Union . \nThe Oscar nominee explained why he wore the ribbon in a quote tweeted out by the ACLU. “I’m wearing an ACLU ribbon because they’re fighting incredible fights right now for American ideals,” he said.
