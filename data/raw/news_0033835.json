'To get bulky, you've got to be training at least six times a week and eating a truck load.' He said despite many people still believing just lifting weights will leave them looking like a human Hulk, perceptions are beginning to change. Joining the bandwagon: Mr Rivier said models and celebrities were also starting to promote squats and deadlifts, proclaiming strong to be the new fitness goal, above thin 'People have really cottoned on to the importance of strength training - all the models and celebrities are doing it - the squats and the deadlifts,' he said. Mr Rivier explained that having a toned figure is actually just having muscle definition, something which is not achievable without strength exercises. TONING YOUR STOMACH Mr Rivier chooses to use bottom-focused exercises to work on abdominal areas such as the below 'knee tucks' and 'straight leg raises'. 'The trick here is to not only lift your knees up to hip height, but to go beyond that up towards your chest. This is where all the good stuff happens,' he said. 'Your hips will roll forward slightly in the process and you'll feel your abs \"crunch\" together.' TIP: Dylan recommends starting with a bent knee before attempting the straight leg. ** These can also be performed lying flat on the ground with the palm of your hands resting on the ground behind your bum. Mimic the same movement, trying to maintain a flat back on the ground the entire time. It gets much harder the lower your legs go. 'One isn't better than the other,' he said, when asked if we should bin cardio altogether. 'You still want to include some aerobic conditioning, but strength training will help you lose weight faster.' Luckily, the Personal Trainer also said there was no need to spend more than an hour a day exercising. Don't forget about it: The 35-year-old says cardio is still important, but not as much as strength training While fitter clients of his were always encouraged to work out more, he said 40 - 60 minutes three times a week was enough for most people. He also noted that while diet was important in terms of building muscle, there was no one-size-fits-all when it came to losing weight. He recommended eating 'clean' or unprocessed foods, and cutting back on sugar. EXERCISES TO TONE YOUR ARMS To tone his arms, Mr Rivier uses a set of exercises. While he uses a 20kg bar in the first, he kindly said it could be substituted with a bar of any weight. For those just beginning, he recommends leaving out the pull ups until some muscle has developed. 'The exercises are done as a ladder, so you start with the first exercise - bicep curls. Then you do the first again, followed by the second. Then the first, second and third... and so on until you've done exercises one through six.' Then work back down, but the way we do this is by removing the FIRST exercise in the sequence each time so the order stays the same but it gets shorter [you should end up finishing on six or seven]. 'Make sure you have enough energy to be training, however,' he said. 'There's no point cutting back in calories and going into deficit so much that you don't have the energy to exercise.' Another of the Personal Trainer's top tips was to keep a food diary and review your eating against your progress. Then, he said, you should adjust your diet accordingly.
