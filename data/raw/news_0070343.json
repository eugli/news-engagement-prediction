But they failed in their bid to land the best player in the MLS. \nSebastian Giovinco will remain in North America with Toronto FC despite receiving huge offers from China. \nHis agent Andrea D'Amico detailed the situation by claiming his star client was subject to heavy interest from several CSL sides. (Giovinco doing what he does best!) \nBut even with mega-contracts reportedly tabled, 'Gio' rejected their advances to stay with the Canadian side. \nSpeaking to Sky Sport Italia via Goal , D'Amico reiterated the Italians stance though refused to rule out a move in the future. \n\"For now, he has said no.\" \n\"The money was not right for Toronto and it wasn't right for him either, but let's see. When you talk about the transfer market, it's always a case of 'for now.' \" (Giovinco celebrates after scoring in the Eastern conference semi-finals.) \nStressing 'for now.' \n\"There are so many intermediaries operating with Chinese clubs.\" \n\"They came here and made us an offer, both from Beijing and from other clubs, and then there is an escalation once the first offer is rejected with a better one arriving. \" \nWill we see the diminutive play-maker in the Far East, one day? \nLet us know your thoughts in the comment section below.
