"Share this article Share Michael was surely left red faced when his mother suggested he wasn't as experienced with the ladies as he claimed Jason was thrilled to announce that he was getting his first tattoo but his parents weren't as made up with the idea When David announced that he had lost his virginity he didn't expect his mother to be the first to congratulate him Mark was pleased to have broken his dry spell but not so thrilled that his mum liked the status Casey probably felt that this was a little too much information on her mother's part This woman's mother was unaware that her message to her daughter would be so public Tim was less than impressed to find out that his brother Casey is his mum's favourite child Christine was pleased that Brett thought of her as a MILF but was unsure of the definition It was likely that Patrick's friends wrote this status as a practical joke however, his mother suggested there may be some truth in it Ronnie warned Cam to back off when he left an explicit message on his daughter's status When Cap'n Jax quoted George Michael's Faith in his status he wasn't expecting his mum to respond Angie's dad is clearly proud of his assets but she would probably rather he keeps it to himself Michele seemed to have no qualms about sharing details of her personal life on Facebook Tracy was less than impressed with her father's antics during a trip to Las Vegas Chelsea had to politely decline her mother's invitation to tuck her in This man was clearly trying to show off his more serious side until his mother pointed out a beloved childhood toy in the background of the photo While Debbie had been talking about Nick's drink her caption suggests she is calling her son a virgin in this Facebook post Joe tried to make a lewd joke about his penis but his mother struggled with the punch line James is becoming increasingly exasperated with his Dad's inability to use Facebook inbox When Damion hoped that a pretty girl would come and visit him it is unlikely that he wanted his mum to be that someone This mother was inclined to shame their child after they claimed they were a 'thug' Amanda was less than amused by her son Terry's inventive new name on Facebook Barb wanted to make it very clear that she wasn't prepared to take up her son's offer It seems that John's mum is perhaps not entirely clued up on the definition of MILFs Lynette refused to be told what she can and can't write on her son Jared's status Austin wrote a defiant status against his mother but didn't expect her sassy response In fairness the son in question may have over shared with this status but surely didn't expect their mum to comment This young man had tried to humiliate someone online and this was clearly unacceptable to his mother who took matters into her own hands Alec was not impressed by his mum's very honest Facebook post about her sex life Melody's dad's comment on her photo is a little unsettling for a father-daughter
