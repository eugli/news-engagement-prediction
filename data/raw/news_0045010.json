Peta Murgatroyd and Maks Chmerkovskiy welcomed their son, Shai, in early January, and on Tuesday, the rhythmically gifted pair announced they would be returning to Dancing With the Stars . The seasoned dance pros will rejoin the cast of the hit ABC dancing competition series and be rivals once more. WATCH: Maksim Chmerkovskiy Shares Sweet Photo With Peta Murgatroyd and Son on Valentine's Day: ‘I’m in Love With Us’ “Yeah, it’s been some time,” Peta said   . “I’m definitely a little bit nervous but I’m very excited to get back. I’m definitely missed the dance floor. I haven’t been able to defend my title with Nyle [DiMarco].” WATCH: @PetaMurgatroyd and @MaksimC announce their return to the @DancingABC ballroom following the birth of their baby. #DWTS pic.twitter.com/0GwEPsCUp9 — Good Morning America (@GMA) February 21, 2017 Maks isn’t too concerned about getting bested by his fiancée, reminding the GMA viewers, “Last time we were together on the same season, I won.” He did say that being away from his infant son would prove difficult once rehearsals got into full swing. “This is the only difficult part about coming back on the show because it will just take time away from being with this dude,” he admitted. “But I just want to make her coming back and winning as difficult as possible. Yeah, somebody has to pose some competition.” Jokes aside, Peta is set on getting back in shape the right way. A post shared by Peta Murgatroyd (@petamurgatroyd) on Feb 17, 2017 at 6:47am PST “I just want to be healthy. It’s going to take a little bit longer to get back up to the fitness that I was doing and had before,” she said. “I think it’s going to be OK, and I’m going to take it slowly. I have an awesome partner to go through this with.” As for “uncle” Val Chmerkovskiy, the couple doesn’t expect any help from him with taking care of their little one. “Val is waiting for when he can use the baby as leverage,” Maks quipped of his brother.
