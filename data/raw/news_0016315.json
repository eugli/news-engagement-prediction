FACEBOOK PHOTO/CHANG EULDAN \nSebastian “Baste” Duterte, the youngest son of President Rodrigo Duterte, told his father not to get stressed, saying he is only staying in their other house. \n“Good morning, Pa. Nasa kabilang bahay lang ako noong February 1 pa. Huwag ka nang ma-stress (I’ve been staying in the other house since February 1. Don’t get stressed). Love you mwah,” he said in a Facebook post on Sunday. \nAnd on Tuesday, the presidential son wrote another post saying: “Pa, tama na please.” ADVERTISEMENT \n“Si Chocolate naman ang pagalitan mo. Mas grabe iyon (Scold Chocolate. What he did was worse). Haha Lels,” he added, referring to a viral video of the local comedian. \nLast February 2, the President has expressed annoyance with his youngest son for staying away from home for too long. Duterte said that his grandchildren with Baste have become bitter about their father’s absence. \nHours after the President’s remark, Baste posted that he really loved being his father’s favorite son. He did not talk about his children but asked Duterte to just take it easy. \n“Chill lang (Just chill) Pa,” he said.
