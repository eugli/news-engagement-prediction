Actually that's very frightening. That's scary as hell,\" Scarborough told Colbert. \nColbert also brought up the fact that Scarborough's cohost, Mika Brzezinski, banned Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway from the show. \n“It got to a point where Kellyanne would keep coming out and everything she said was disproven five minutes later,” Scarborough said. “And it wasn’t disproven by a fact-checker — it was somebody else in the administration who would come out and actually say, ‘Well, actually, no, that’s not true.’” \nColbert said he had another \"quicker way\" of framing Conway's quotes. \n\"She just lied,\" Colbert said of Conway. \nScarborough urged Republicans in Congress to keep Trump honest, saying that after his presidency, the party's politicians will be \"judged for the next 50 years on how they respond to the challenges of today.\" \nWatch Joe Scarborough's interview with Stephen Colbert on \"The Late Show\" below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:05:47.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
