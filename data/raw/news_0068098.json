(Irene Young)  43 PM \nAdd Holly Miranda’s voice to the resistance at Standing Rock. \nThe singer-songwriter released a stirring rendition of Cris Williamson’s “Midnight Oil” on Wednesday with all proceeds benefitting the Sioux Nation reservation. \n“Midnight Oil” features a 28-person chorus, dubbed The New Asylum Choir, including artists and activists like Ani DiFranco, Jaime King, Kyp Malone of TV On The Radio, Sasheer Zamata of \"Saturday Night Live,\" progressive commentator Sally Kohn, and \"Daily Show\" co-creator Lizz Winstead. \n“From Israel to Mexico and all over friends sent their voices to me,” Miranda said. “It was a magical thing to watch this song build and to hear the stories of this mantra getting stuck in everyone's head.” \nMiranda opens the track sparsely, with only a piano and drum accompanying her voice. As the song progresses, she’s joined by a full band and strings, gradually building to an anthemic chorus that urges hope in the face of overwhelming odds: “Don’t let the midnight oil burn low, no don’t let it burn out / Let’s see how things turn out in the end.” \nThe song was originally released in 1978 by Cris Williamson , who also lends her voice to the New Asylum Choir.

(Blake Nicholson/AP) \nMiranda first discovered the song at a vintage record store in upstate New York two days after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, which moved her to record a version of the song and seek out other activists to sing on the track. \nThe charity single was released on the same day protesters of the Dakota Access Pipeline set fire to the protest site hours ahead of the Army Corps of Engineers’ deadline for demonstrators to vacate the area. \nPolice began arresting protesters Wednesday as some refused to leave their long-term camps.

(TERRAY SYLVESTER/REUTERS) \nThe Sioux Nation has argued that the $3.8 billion pipeline violates their territorial rights from an 1851 treaty. Environmental activists believe that the pipeline, which would bring crude oil from North Dakota’s Bakken oil pitch through the Midwest and to the Gulf Coast, would threaten the tribe’s water source and cultural sites. \n“Water is life,” Miranda said. “We've got to help each other, take care of each other.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:26:05.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
