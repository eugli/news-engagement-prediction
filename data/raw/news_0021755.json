I moved here four years ago to begin an internal medicine residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital. As part of a small cadre of doctors within the residency program being trained to tackle urban health issues, I sought to better understand Baltimore’s unique history. Segregative traditions such as redlining and the harsh drug epidemic that continues to this day made clear why these distressed neighborhoods exist.\nWhen I completed my residency last year, the hospital’s neighborhood looked very different from the way it did a few years before. Boarded-up rowhouses took on new life, and wide expanses of rarely manicured grass gave way to fancy apartment buildings and luxury townhomes. Meanwhile, just steps away, poverty and crime continued to show that there is a long way to go before we see real progress.\nDemolishing old and uninhabitable rowhouses may lift the spirits of a run-down city block, but improved access to healthy food and good jobs makes an even better and more sustainable impact on these neighborhoods. I hope that Baltimore will make a greater investment in these areas as well as in public transportation initiatives. That would improve and stabilize neighborhoods in this great city much more than a bulldozer could.\nRyan D.
