Instead, she quietly became a mother after telling friends she had been considering it for some time. The revelation about her motherhood is likely to raise eyebrows in the art world, given her age. But she was unlikely to have had the time before now, with her working day consisting of early mornings, back-to-back meetings and social events in the evenings. Announcing her departure from the Serpentine, she said she wanted to spend more time painting. 'I will be starting all over again,' she said at the time. 'I am 64. My goal is to live to 100 and remain in really good shape. And I feel I need to make that investment in what the future will hold.'

She also managed to secure powerful backers including former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and raised £14million to turn a nearby 19th-century munitions store into a show space. Under her stewardship, visitors numbers rose five-fold and it is now one of the most popular galleries in London.
