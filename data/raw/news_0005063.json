Barkley called him \" whiny \" and \"inappropriate\" for questioning the Cavaliers' front office. \nJames clearly had a lot of ill will bottled up, and he unleashed it all at once. \n\"He's a hater,\" James said on Monday, per ESPN . \"What makes what he says credible? Because he's on TV?\" \nBut boy, does it get much, much more heated than that. \n\"I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that,\" James told ESPN . \"I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas. I never said, 'I'm not a role model.' I never showed up to All-Star Weekend on Sunday because I was in Vegas all weekend partying.\" \nSBNation did a mighty fine job breaking down each of those individual burns. But here are the spark notes, with moments from all over Barkley's Hall-of-Fame career. \nIn 1997, a man threw ice in Barkley's face, so he proceeded to push that man through a bar window . During a game in 1991, he spit on a young girl in the front row, instead of the heckler he meant to hit. In 2008, he almost faced felony charges for not paying a $400,000 gambling debt in Las Vegas. He repeatedly said, \"I'm not a role model\" in a 1993 Nike commercial. \n\"All I've done for my entire career is represent the NBA the right way,\" James continued . \"Fourteen years, never got in trouble. Respected the game. Print that.\" \nYou get the idea. James had a laundry list of sick burns just waiting to be unleashed. \nBut how exactly did this feud begin? \nWell, Barkley has been a James \"hater\" for a while it seems. In 2010, James held an hour-long television special, \" The Decision ,\" to announce his free agent signing with the Miami Heat. Barkley called it a \"punk move.\" \n“That was torture. I want that hour back in my life,\" said Barkley, who — to be fair — wasn't the only one who didn't like \"The Decision.\" \nBarkley has also consistently kept LeBron James off his list of all-time NBA greats. Barkley confirmed that decision last summer, just days after James won his third championship ring and third NBA Finals MVP award. Charles Barkley just named his top-7 NBA players of all-time.1 Jordan ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:03:38.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
