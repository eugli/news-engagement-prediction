Rogen will play the schlub, obviously, “an unemployed journalist” who is “battered by his own misfortune and self-destructive ways.” Theron will be Rogen’s former babysitter, who now happens to be “one of the most powerful and unattainable women on Earth.” The Deadline report doesn’t lay out the specifics, but apparently the plot involves Rogen trying to get his life back on track by finally achieving his dream of seducing Theron’s character, which probably won’t go too well. \nProduction is set to start in August, so the release is of Flarsky is pretty far off. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:45:52.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
