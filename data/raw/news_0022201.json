Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com \nST. LOUIS • A bill spelling out how the city will finance Scottrade Center renovations received final passage from the Board of Aldermen Friday during a marathon seven-hour meeting that featured heated discussions, loud arguments and a bizarre switch in which one of the bill's sponsors voted against it. \nThe board approved issuing $64 million in bonds to help fund a renovation of the facility, which the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League call home. \nAs the board rushed to pass a series of bills before going on a 10-week break, board President Lewis Reed, a sponsor and supporter of the plan to renovate the Scottrade center, voted “yes,” in an initial vote, than changed his vote to “no” for the final approval. \nWhat made it even more confusing to lobbyists and lawmakers alike was that Reed, a candidate running for mayor, has accepted thousands in campaign contributions from people affiliated with Scottrade or the Blues. \nDave Steward, co-founder of World Wide Technology and a minority owner of the Blues, has given Reed $165,000 in campaign donations since July, including $100,000 on Thursday. \nAdditionally, Kiel Center Partners, the group that holds the lease on Scottrade, gave Reed $10,000 in November. \nTwo months later, Reed signed on to sponsor the group's bill. As president of the board, he rarely serves as a bill sponsor. \nReed on Friday explained his switch by calling it a “philosophical decision.” \nThe original plan was for the board to advance a number of bills this week and then vote on final passage when members come back from their break on April 17. Instead, aldermen voted numerous times to skip ahead and take final votes Friday. \nReed said he didn't agree with that tactic on the Scottrade bill. \n“After giving it some thought, I felt there was no reason to rush this bill through,” he said. “When you have certain hotly debated topics, I just think it's better not to rush. It's OK to give people time to think about the bills and debate them” on the normal schedule. \nDespite his “no” vote, Reed said he still supports the bill. \n“One hundred percent,” he said. “I think it will be great for the city.” \nIn an earlier interview, Reed responded to the perception that he's supporting legislation as a quid pro quo for campaign donations. \n“That's not the way I operate,” he said, adding that he's not motivated by money. \nBefore running for office, Reed managed IT systems and developed software. “In choosing public service I've given up $75,000 in salary every year for the past 10 years,” he said. \n“I've put a ton of my own money into my campaigns and I'll do the same for this campaign,” he continued. “You can't buy me.” \nReed also said the large donations from Steward have nothing to do with the Blues, but rather their shared connection to longtime educator and and community leader Ida Goodwin Woolfolk, who passed away last year . \n“I don't know (Steward) from the Blues,” Reed said. “I know him through Ida Goodwin Woolfolk. Over the years he's gotten to know me and he's been supportive of me” \nOutside of the confusion over Reed's votes, there was plenty of action during Friday's debate over Scottrade renovations. \nCombined with interest, the $64 million in bond debt would cost the city more than $100 million over 30 years, A motion to send the bill back to committee failed 17-11. \nOpposing aldermen loudly argued that city services would be hurt if general revenue is used to pay for the improvements. \nAlderman Sam Moore, 4th Ward, shouted \"Shame!\" Alderman Cara Spencer, 20th Ward, said her \"heart breaks\" to see the city focused on sports stadiums with a $20 million budget shortfall looming next fiscal year. \n\"We are telling our city what we prioritize: subsidizing professional sports,\" Spencer said. \nBut the majority in favor of the bill said Scottrade Center will generate more tax revenue over time with the improvements. Alderman Stephen Conway, 8th Ward, said stadium events and event parking generate a combined $10 million in taxes annually that will either increase or decrease based on whether the renovations happen. \n\"We have the value of hindsight in this because we know how much it generates,\" Conway said. \nSupporters also reminded the room that the city owns Scottrade Center but hasn't put money into improving the building since it opened in 1994. Since then it has generated a combined $100 million in tax revenue, supporters say. \nBut Spencer said the city agreed to own the building as a benefit to the developers so there would be no property taxes paid on it. \"Ownership is a tax abatement,\" Spencer said. \nAlderman Joe Roddy, 17th Ward, wondered aloud if anyone \"had picked up the phone and called the county executive\" about helping fund the renovations. Roddy said he understood about 80 percent of attendees at Scottrade Center events live outside the city. \nConway said it was possible Scottrade Center could lose a collegiate championship event held by the Southeastern Conference scheduled for 2018 if the renovations weren't approved soon. A spokesman for the SEC has declined to comment on the Scottrade Center renovations issue. \nUnder the plan, the city would pay a total of $105 million over 30 years including cash and interest payments. The plan additionally includes $50 million from a Community Improvement District tax on sales at Scottrade Center over the next 30 years. \nTo help pay off the debt, $55 million from a 5 percent tax on ticket sales would be used. With debt payments on Kiel Opera House renovations ending in 2021, the $800,000 dedicated annually to that project would shift to Scottrade Center payments thru 2048, totaling about $21 million. Part of the debt payment still will come from general revenue. \nOfficials also are hoping for $70.5 million from the state to fund a second phase of renovations, but they haven’t set a timeline for that proposal. \nAlso Friday, the board passed two bills pertaining to the financing of the Major League Soccer stadium proposal. City residents will vote April 4 on whether to help finance such a stadium.
