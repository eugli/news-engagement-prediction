And then there is what the Butler Bulldogs did to Xavier on Sunday. \nThe 22nd-ranked Bulldogs repeatedly stole the ball during a late 11-1 run, and Kelan Martin scored 25 points in an 88-79 victory that ran their winning streak to four. \nButler (23-6, 12-5) shot 55 percent and secured the No. 2 seed in the Big East tournament. It was the fifth consecutive loss for Xavier (18-11, 8-8). \nThe Bulldogs also ended a streak of five straight losses at the Cintas Center. \n• BOX SCORE: Butler 88, Xavier 79 \nEven in what has been a momentous 2000s for Butler basketball, this was one of the most consequential weeks. The Bulldogs went on the road and, in successive games, knocked off No. 2 Villanova 74-66 and their top rival. \nMartin, coming off the bench again, shot 9-of-15 and led Butler with seven rebounds. Freshman guard Kamar Baldwin added 17 points and five steals, and Andrew Chrabascz 11 points and six assists. \nPark Tudor’s Trevon Bluiett led Xavier with 21 points. J.P. Macura had 17, Malcolm Bernard 13 and Quentin Goodin 11. \nWith 5:43 left, Macura gave the Musketeers a 71-69 lead with two free throws, then a steal and dunk. \nThe Bulldogs retaliated quickly, and emphatically. They exploited Xavier turnovers to go on an 11-1 run and seize an 80-72 lead with 3 minutes to play.
