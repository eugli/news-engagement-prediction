(CARLOS BARRIA/REUTERS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Wednesday, February 22, 2017, 1:19 AM \nMelania Trump has scrubbed her lawsuit against the Daily Mail from claims that the website wrecked her chances at profiting off the presidency by describing her as a hooker in a since-deleted news story. \nThe First Lady filed a $150 million defamation suit against The Mail earlier this month over an Aug. 19 article that claimed she worked as an \"elite escort\" in the \"sex business\" during the 1990s. \nTrump charged in her original suit that the allegedly bogus story destroyed her \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to launch a \"multi-million dollar business\" as \"one of the most photographed women in the world.\" \nBut an amended complaint obtained by the Daily News on Tuesday no longer contains Trump's apparent intensions to strike it rich in the White House. Previously listed details about \"product categories\" that Trump was looking to invest in had also been removed. \nTrump’s attorney, Charles Harder, declined to comment when reached by The News on Tuesday evening. The Mail didn't immediately respond to multiple emails. President Trump points to his wife during a campaign rally in Florida on Saturday. (Chris O'Meara/AP) \nThe revised complaint comes amid mounting criticism from ethics experts over the First Lady’s original suit. \n\"This is a very serious situation where she says she intends to make a lot of money,\" Richard Painter, a former ethics adviser on the second Bush administration, recently told the Associated Press. \"That ought to be repudiated by the White House or investigated by Congress.” \nA Maryland blogger was forced to pay the First Lady a \"substantial sum\" as part of a confidential settlement after he circulated the prostitution rumors on his site. Like The Mail, the blogger also issued an apology for the unsubstantiated story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:35:37.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
