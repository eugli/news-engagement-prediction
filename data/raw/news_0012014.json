Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian View more sharing options Josh Halliday and agencies   14.04 GMT \nA 20-year-old man has been jailed for racially abusing a US army veteran who was told to “Get back to Africa” days after the Brexit vote. \nRobert Molloy was sentenced to 24 weeks in prison over the racist attack, which was filmed by a fellow tram passenger in Manchester . \nMolloy was ordered to pay £400 costs and compensation of £50 to Juan Jasso, a former US serviceman who has lived in England for 18 years, and two other people he targeted on 28 June last year. \nThe sentencing of his co-defendant, Aaron Cauchi, 19, was delayed when an ambulance was called to Manchester magistrates court because Cauchi was complaining of severe stomach pains. \nThe video of the incident sparked outrage after it was posted online at a time when police across the UK were warning of a rise in reported hate crime after the EU referendum on 23 June. \nThe footage shows one person telling Jasso: “Don’t chat shit when you’re not even from England, you little fucking immigrant. Get off the fucking tram now. Get back to Africa.” \nSentencing Molloy, the chairman of the magistrates bench, Michael Evans, described the incident as an “alcohol-fuelled rampage around Manchester causing considerable fear to members of the public including children”. \nHe imposed a two-year criminal behaviour order meaning Molloy cannot travel on the Metrolink network or associate with his co-defendant. \nThe magistrate told Molloy: “Hopefully when you are released from prison a lesson will be learned and you will be able to make a positive contribution and treat people with respect.” \nThe court heard that Molloy, Cauchi and a 16-year-old, who cannot be named, had been up all night and were “looking for trouble”. \nJasso said after the incident that Brexit “maybe has pushed people to somehow justify that they think it’s OK now to act out in this way”. \nThe trouble began at about 7.45am when a passenger heard “disgusting, vile abuse” on the tram, the court heard. \nOne of the group was shouting: “I’m going to lick your mum’s pussy.” Jasso stepped forward and told them to mind their language, and all three turned on him. \nMolloy, the instigator, told Jasso: “Don’t chat shit when you’re not even from England, you little fucking immigrant. Get off the fucking tram now. Get back to Africa.” \nMolloy then flicked beer over Jasso from the bottle he was holding before all three got off the tram. \nMinutes later they surrounded Alistair Lambert, who was with a female work colleague, “with their chests stuck out and shoulders back”, and struck him with a cigarette lighter to intimidate him. \nShortly afterwards, Andrew Guest was cycling to work and he passed the three. One or more spat in his face and down his body. \nOne of the defence lawyers suggested during the hearing that the “divisive rhetoric” used in the EU referendum campaign had affected their behaviour. \nJames McDermott, who represented Cauchi, said: ‘’What is significant is the timing of the offence – it happened five days after the EU referendum. Clearly several months leading up to the referendum those in positions of great responsibility employed divisive rhetoric that clearly has had an impact – there’s been a huge increase in the number of similar incidents. \n“That’s not offered as an excuse, but I would suggest the time and background is something your worships can bear in mind.” \nMolloy, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty on Monday to a racially aggravated assault on Jasso, common assault on Guest and using threatening words and behaviour towards Lambert. \nThe 16-year-old pleaded guilty to using threatening words or behaviour towards Jasso and Lambert and common assault on Guest. He was given a six-month referral order and will have to pay a £100 fine and £5 compensation to each of the three victims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T16:14:23.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
