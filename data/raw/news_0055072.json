Cohen — the executive producers behind Futurama — are getting back together with \"much of\" the series' original writing team for a new mobile game. \nFuturama: Worlds of Tomorrow is... a video game. Of some kind. We know that much. SEE ALSO: Student creates enormous 'Simpsons' portrait on his college's wintry lawn \nIt's coming from the team at TinyCo, the studio behind Marvel Avengers Academy and Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff . Both of those earlier games are quite different, so it's tough to predict what Futurama might bring. \nThe Avengers game is all about quests and combat. You recruit heroes, complete various tasks, participate in live events and level up your super team. If you're familiar with Mafia Wars then you have a good sense of what happens here as well. \nFamily Guy , on the other hand, more closely resembles city-building games like The Simpsons: Tapped Out . You build your own version Quahog — which, prior to the events of the game, was destroyed in a storyline from the series' writers — and improve it over time. \nFuturama could go in either direction — or do something completely different — but Family Guy 's seems the most likely path for Worlds of Tomorrow . Both of the earlier games are free-to-play titles, and both keep their fan communities hooked with a regular lineup of live events. I'd expect a similar outcome for Futurama as well. \nYou've probably picked up on the fact that there's not a lot of info to be gleaned just yet. There's no word on when more will be revealed, but you can sign up on the upcoming game's official website for updates. \nIn case you're not familiar: Futurama is the other Groening series, the one that isn't called The Simpsons . It follows the adventures of Philip J. Fry, a pizza delivery guy who accidentally cryofreezes himself on New Year's Eve 1999 and wakes up 1,000 years later. \nFor those keeping score at home, this won't be the first Futurama mobile game. Futurama: Game of Drones is a match-three puzzle game that was released in Nov. 2015. That one featured an original story as well but Groening and Cohen were not involved.
