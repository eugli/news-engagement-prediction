Trump’s nomination of Colorado appeals court Judge Neil Gorsuch was a moment for the GOP to rally behind its president after 10 days of ping-ponging between controversies: from the troubled rollout of a travel ban on nationals of seven Muslim-majority nations to Trump’s false claim that millions of fraudulent votes were cast in the 2016 election to prolonged battles — egged on by Trump — about the size of his inauguration crowd.\nStory Continued Below\n“It’s nice to be able to change the subject,” said Rep. Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican who has criticized Trump’s immigration order.\nGorsuch’s nomination won widespread praise from all corners of the GOP. And Trump’s inclusion of House Republican leaders in his announcement helped win a positive reception on the Hill. Interviews with Republican lawmakers Wednesday revealed a palpable sense that the move had calmed — for now — the nerves of lawmakers unsettled by Trump’s often chaotic start.\nSupreme Court \nWhat Trump’s Supreme Court pick means for the court By Josh Gerstein \n“I think having a campaign promise that’s been fulfilled should encourage conservatives,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a member of the House’s conservative Freedom Caucus. “It helps us understand that while progress may have a few bumps in the roads, we’re still making progress.” \nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley speaks after meeting with President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, on Capitol Hill on Feb. 1. | M.Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\nRep. Richard Hudson, another North Carolina Republican, said he expected the positive moment could help the Trump administration “catch their stride.”\n“He’s got folks really excited,” Hudson said.\nIt’s a sharp change in tone from the first 10 days of the administration, when the anti-Trump Women’s March and mass demonstrations at international airports dominated national headlines. \nRep. Steve King said Trump’s court nomination was a relief for conservatives. The Iowa Republican even suggested that “it may well have been a White House decision to move the nomination of the justice of the Supreme Court up a day or two just to change the topic, rather than wait until Thursday.” Trump administration spokesman Sean Spicer recently told reporters that Trump moved up the Supreme Court announcement “because he wanted to.”\n“Now we’re focused on confirmation of a new justice…It’s good to change the topic, the rhythm, and change it to something that is very positive for the constitutionalists and the rule-of-law people in America,” King said.\nWhite House \nHow Trump got to yes on Gorsuch By Shane Goldmacher , Eliana Johnson and Josh Gerstein \nStill, for all the good feelings following the nomination, some lawmakers said there was a sense of foreboding that the next controversy may be a tweet away.\nSenate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell meets with Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch on Feb. 1 at the Capitol. | Getty\nAnd Trump himself offered a new distraction first thing Wednesday morning when he reopened a semantic battle over his immigration order: whether or not it should be dubbed a travel “ban.” \n“Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN,” he tweeted just hours after standing alongside Gorsuch at the White House to announce his nomination. “Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!”\nRep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) said Trump’s administration will undoubtedly make mistakes again in part because “wants to get a lot done in a short period of time.”\n“Every now and then he’s going to step into a pile of horse manure,” Griffith said. \nAnd King argued that it’s only a matter of time before demonstrations begin anew. Though he dismisses the protests as artificially stoked by Democratic leaders he said they’re still upsetting to Republicans.\n\"I think President Trump is going to have to deal with these flare-ups and demonstrations because they’re organized and called for by leaders … I think we are going to have a demonstration a week until it dies down or they run out of funding,” he said.\n\nHouse begins tearing up Obama-era rules By Alex Guillén \nAnd some Republicans aren’t ready to turn the page on Trump’s more controversial moves. Dent, whose Pennsylvania district includes a large Syrian population, said he’s still grappling with Trump’s immigration order, noting that he’s working with a Syrian constituent who had prepared a home for a refugee family only to see their visas canceled mid-flight.\nBut Republicans spent the day flooding inboxes with positive statements about the administration’s choice for the high court. And for at least a day, Republicans seemed united in feeling positive for the first time since Trump took office.\n“Overall, he’s heading us in the right direction,” Griffith said. “The Supreme Court is a good point.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:18:20.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
