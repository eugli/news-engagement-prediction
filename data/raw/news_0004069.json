On a rainy night in Harlem, a muscular man sits on a milk cart, smoking a cigarette, waiting. What he’s waiting for, a police car, is not long in coming. In voice-over, the man introduces himself as L, adding: “Check with your crew. Find out who I am.” The film, “Chapter & Verse,” is directed by Jamal Joseph from a script he wrote with Daniel Beaty, who also gives a superb performance in the lead role of an ex-convict re-entering society. After that opening, the movie flashes back to a newly released L (short for Lance; the scene in which he explains his name is as warmly funny as it is heartbreaking), seething with frustration as he fails to find work repairing computers. “I got two computer certificates,” he complains to his halfway-house officer. The response isn’t sympathetic: “I took piano lessons. You don’t see [me] at Carnegie Hall.” So Lance winds up at a community food-delivery service and soon becomes friendly with Miss Maddy (Loretta Devine), whose artistically talented grandson Ty (Khadim Diop) is involved with the kind of gang business that got Lance locked up in the first place. The movie’s wide-screen framing, ruthless plot reversals and say-what-you-mean writing sometimes recall a master of socially conscious cinema from another era, Sam Fuller . But this is a picture with its own strong voice. It’s not perfect — a subplot that has Lance fending off advances from his supervisor is arbitrarily sexist. Although it does give rise to the movie’s funniest dialogue exchange. And the actual ending, while troubling, holds out a tenuous kind of hope.
