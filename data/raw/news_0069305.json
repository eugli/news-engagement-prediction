The bulk of the Warriors' scoring load was shared by Steph Curry (35 points) and Kevin Durant (25). \nWith the win, powered by a 50-point outburst in the third quarter, the Warriors take the season series 4-0 from the Clippers, who have struggled mightily to compete with Golden State. \nThe Warriors sport an NBA-best 48-9 record and lead the Western Conference playoff race by 4.5 games over the San Antonio Spurs. The Clippers, meanwhile, are tied for fourth in the conference with the Utah Jazz with identical 35-22 records - 13 games behind the Warriors.
