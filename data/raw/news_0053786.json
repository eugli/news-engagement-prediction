It's exciting stuff, but don’t expect to see the hoverbikes on your local expressway anytime soon. For now, Hoversurf sees it as an “extreme sports instrument,” though it adds that its potential for transportation “remains evident.” \nHoversurf is also developing a drone taxi, saying it plans to launch the first commercial application in 2018 under a different platform called MARK-S. The beefed up drone boasts a computer that includes sensors and sonar, as well as a security system. Watch the trailer for the Scorpion-3 hoverbike below and fade off into daydreams of blasters and Ewoks at your own discretion.
