(Photo: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports) \nA movie and a book about Tom Brady's journey to winning Super Bowl 51 is in the works, according to a report by Deadline.com's Anita Busch . \nThe team that will make it happen consists of Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson, who both worked on The Finest Hours , The Fighter and Patriots Day. Plus, Dave Wedge, who co-wrote Boston Strong . I also feel like it's important to note that Tamasy was a writer for the excellent late 1990s/early 2000s Air Bud films. \nIn addition to covering the Patriots' comeback win in what may have been the greatest Super Bowl of all time , the movie and book will cover Deflategate too. Here's more from Deadline.com: \nâ€¦but it's not going to shy away from controversy and will include the team's battle to overcome the Deflategate debacle in 2014, follow Brady's fall from grace and then his triumphant return to lead the Patriots to his fifth world championship. \nThere's no release date included in the report. It simply says this is all \"on its way.\" Read or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/tom-brady-super-bowl-51-movie-report-patriots-book-deflategate/ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:10:20.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
