He adds he has other AFL clubs “lining up” to replace the Suns.\n“The AFL is going to have to rule on it because it is distracting on the absolute historic event this China game is all about, ” Koch said on radio FIVEaa this morning.\nThe AFL has repeatedly refused to enter the debate saying the league has Gold Coast listed as the home team in China — and the Suns have the right to wear their home jumper.\nKoch says that rule has been superseded by a contract between the two clubs. Gold Coast responds there is no such written agreement.\nKoch adds Port Adelaide has paid Gold Coast $500,000 to take its home game from Metricon Stadium to Shanghai and “we have bought all rights to this game as if we are the home club.”\nAFL China launch.

We have bought this game — and paid good money for it. We are the ones who are committed for the next sort of 10 years to play a game in China each year. We had a number of other clubs that wanted to play us this year and there is no shortage of clubs that want to leverage our work in China.\n“As I have said to (Gold Coast chairman) Tony Cochrane, if you wear the red-and-gold jumper it will be the last time we will play you in China. It is up to you.\n“It is for the AFL to make a decision — and we will abide by it.”\nPort Adelaide needs to buy a game from a rival AFL club to play in China as the State government-AFL agreement at Adelaide Oval forbids either the Crows or Power from moving any of their home games from the Oval.\nOriginally published as ‘It’ll be the last time we play you’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:43:03.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
