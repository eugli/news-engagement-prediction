On Tuesday, Politico obtained a 27-year-old episode of “The Oprah Winfrey Show” in which Lisa Fierstein spoke out about the alleged abuse she suffered. She has since recanted her claims. \nKashen said the domestic violence allegations helped sealed Puzder’s fate and also credited the many Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s employees who came forward with stories of discrimination endured while working at those restaurants. Puzder is the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, the parent company of those fast-food chains.

Mike Blake / Reuters \nPuzder, 66, has been a vocal opponent of worker’s rights, coming out against minimum wage increases and other benefits that would disproportionately benefit women, who make up a majority of low-paid hourly workers. He’s been outspoken about the allure of automating fast-food and retail jobs. \n“They [robots] never take a vacation, they never show up late, there’s never a slip and fall, or an age, sex or race discrimination suit,” he said recently. \nAnd even before his fast-food career began, Puzder had a history of working against women’s rights. As an attorney in Missouri, he authored a fetal personhood law that defined life as beginning at conception and was part of a broader strategy to overturn Roe v. Wade. \nAs the CEO of fast-food chains Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., Puzder stood up for widely criticized advertising campaigns featuring nearly naked women eating burgers. \n“I like our ads. I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis. I think it’s very American,” Puzder told Entrepreneur last year. “I used to hear, brands take on the personality of the CEO. And I rarely thought that was true, but I think this one, in this case, it kind of did take on my personality.” Fred Prouser / Reuters \nThe sentiment behind these ads led to harassment and discrimination at Puzder’s restaurants, according to women’s groups. \n“The corporate culture created by the ads has put his employees at risk, given the already high level of sexual harassment in the restaurant industry,” the National Women’s Law Center said in a statement released Wednesday morning. \nAlmost from the instant Puzder was nominated, organizations working to end domestic violence and sexual assault focused on allegations that he had physically abused his wife in the 1980s. \nFierstein alleged in court documents that Puzder assaulted and battered her on May 22, 1986, “striking her violently about the face, chest, back, shoulders and neck.” That beating, she claimed, caused “severe and permanent injuries” ― a sentiment she repeated during an appearance on the “The Oprah Winfrey Show” a few years later. \nIn recent weeks, government watchdog group Campaign for Accountability has led the fight to unseal Puzder’s divorce filings , arguing that the public deserves to know if they contain domestic violence allegations. \nWhile a judge released some previously unseen documents, the full records remained sealed on Wednesday. Dan Stevens, the executive director of Campaign for Accountability, said he was gratified that Senate Republicans recognize that allegations of domestic violence should disqualify a person from serving at the highest level of government. \n“[We] worked to make the labor secretary nominee’s entire record available for public inspection to ensure the American people knew exactly who they who were getting with Mr. Puzder,” he said in a statement. “It’s clear that the more senators learned about Mr. Puzder, the less inclined they were to support him. All nominees should be subject to similar scrutiny.” Also on HuffPost 38 Stunning Photos From Women's Marches Around The World 38 Stunning Photos From Women's Marches Around The World 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:39:54.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
