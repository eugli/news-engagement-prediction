Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA young woman with epilepsy says she has been accused of being drunk and even on drugs while suffering from the after-effects of seizures. \nDeminique Malyon, who was diagnosed with the condition last October, can't communicate, walk straight or focus her gaze after having a fit. \nThe first time she had a seizure, aged 19, even her parents thought she might have taken drugs because of her behaviour in the wake of it. \nThen undiagnosed, Deminique, from Cambridgeshire, started giggling, slurring her words and fidgeting - while her pupils became dilated. \nShe also kept trying to get up - despite an emergency call operator telling her terrified mum, Diane, to keep her in the recovery position. \n\"My dad thought I had taken drugs,\" Deminique told Mirror Online. \n\"And my mother even called my boss and my boyfriend - as we were all out the night before - to ask if I was drinking excessively or taking any drugs. \n\"She said I acted as if I was drunk and, at the time, she even told me off for being silly and asked me to stop joking around. \n\"She was really convinced I was being silly.\" Deminique is pictured with her mum, Diane, who initially thought she was \"joking around\" when she started fitting (Photo: Deminique Malyon) Read More Mum has no memory of being pregnant or giving birth after she was hit by cruel brain condition \nOn another occasion, Deminique suffered from a post-seizure bout of hiccups in a taxi, leading the driver to believe she might be drunk. \n\"The taxi driver told her off and said if she gets sick he would make her pay him to clean his cab,\" said mum-of-two Diane, 47. \nShe added: \"While Deminique is having her full convulsions, it is obvious what is happening and most people will know what is happening. \n\"My worry is that she could injure herself while having a seizure, like falling down stairs or falling off the pavement into the road. \n\"But my biggest fear is if she is alone and has a seizure... afterwards, she is so disorientated and has the symptoms of someone on drugs or intoxicated. \n\"She is very vulnerable and someone could take advantage of her.\" \nIt comes as a leading UK charity is urging the public to think twice before assuming a person who is staggering around, confused, is drunk. \nClare Pelham, Epilepsy Society's CEO, said: \"People with epilepsy tell us they are often unfairly accused of being drunk as they recover from a seizure. And young people with the condition feel they are at increased risk of being wrongly accused, as slurred speech, confusion and the inability to walk properly after a seizure, lead people to think they have been binge drinking or taking drugs.\" Deminique was 19 when she had her first seizure in front of her family, leaving her nine-year-old brother terrified (Photo: Deminique Malyon) Read More \nDeminique, now 20, was diagnosed with epilepsy last October - five months after she suffered her first, frightening seizure in front of her family. \nOn that occasion, she suddenly fell to the ground and started convulsing. \n\"Apparently I was jerking and smashing around on the floor,\" she said. \n\"My mother panicked and apparently told me to stop messing about as my brother got such a fright and was really scared and she thought I was playing about. \n\"I bit my tongue and dribbled all over the floor.\" \nDeminique, who studies at University Centre Peterborough and works at a soft play area in the city, added: \"During another seizure, my mother was out. \n\"I fell on to my makeup table, smashing my mirror and a glass dish, resulting in me cutting my feet and hands as I fell to floor.\" \nShe described how she then started walking across the glass in a bid to find her mum, \"leaving blood all over the floor and walls\" \n\"I came downstairs and when my mother came home she said she thought she had walked into a murder scene,\" she said. \n\"I was covered in blood but was disorientated so could not really say what had happened but the state of my bedroom told the story.\" \nOn another occasion, Deminique, who lives with her family in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, suffered a seizure at a music festival.

I thought she was joking about, it is so easy to misunderstand the situation.\" \nShe added that she is \"absolutely gutted\" her daughter's epilepsy - which doesn't run in her family - is something she \"can't fix\". \n\"It's the worst thing ever to see your child lose control of their body and look so scary and out of control,\" she said. \n\"It's a constant worry for me - is Deminique safe? Will she be OK when not with me? Is she confident and not stressing? Is she happy?\" Epilepsy Society is urging the public to think twice before assuming a person who is staggering around, confused, is drunk (Photo: Epilepsy Society) Read More \nFortunately, Deminique has not suffered a seizure since last October after being prescribed lamotrigine, an anticonvulsant drug. \nHowever, she has apparently suffered some \"terrible\" side effects, including headaches, fatigue and insomnia. \n\"I feel vulnerable and frustrated all the time,\" said the young woman, who carries a card in her purse detailing her condition. \n\"Everyone says it's [epilepsy's] not serious, so I feel I should not be stressed, but I do worry. But people kind of dictate that I am worrying about nothing.\" \nDeminique and her mum want to raise awareness of epilepsy - and the symptoms sufferers can display while recovering from seizures. \n\"People are scared to get involved [when someone is suffering from a seizure or the after-effects]\", said Diane. \n\"But if there was more of an awareness, I am sure people would not jump to conclusions and would be more likely to intervene and help.\" \nDeminique is not the only young woman with epilepsy to have wrongly been accused of being intoxicated following a seizure. \nA mental healthcare assistant called Laura has been mistaken for being drunk many times when she has ended up in A&E after fitting. Deminique and her mum want to raise awareness of epilepsy - and the symptoms sufferers can display while recovering from seizures (Photo: Deminique Malyon) \n\"It is really infuriating,\" Laura, who is in her mid-twenties, told Epilepsy Society. \n\"I have had epilepsy for over a year and wear a MedicAlert bracelet, but on numerous occasions, doctors and nurses in A&E assume I am drunk and call the alcohol liaison officer to talk to me.\" \nA third woman, Sarah, from Bristol, described how she was once shouted at by a passerby while staggering around outside Sainsbury's. \nAt the time, she had just had a seizure. \nSarah, a mum-of-two, said: \"The man said I was drunk and wasn't fit to be a mother. In fact, I don't drink alcohol because of my medication. \n\"Luckily, my partner was with me and was able to explain.\" \nThere are currently around 600,000 people in the UK with epilepsy. \nEpilepsy Society is calling for greater understanding and awareness of the condition and the challenges faced by people whose seizures are unpredictable. \nThe charity's medical director Professor Ley Sander said: \"Epilepsy is a really difficult condition. It is unpredictable and can be upsetting for those around a person who is having a seizure. \n\"We call the period following a seizure the post-ictal stage, when a person is confused and unaware of where they are. They can have trouble walking properly and may stagger around. \n\"It is understandable how this could be confused with alcohol abuse, but anyone who is in difficulty should be treated with dignity and respect. \n\"It is important to talk to the person calmly, find them somewhere safe to recover and ensure that a friend or family member is called. \n\"If medical attention is required then of course call 999. \n\"All healthcare professionals should be aware of the post-ictal stage following a seizure and should treat the person with compassion and care.\" If you would like to talk to someone in confidence about epilepsy, please call Epilepsy Society’s Helpline on 01494 601 400 (Monday and Tuesday, 9am-4pm, Wednesday, 9am-7.30pm) Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:15:34.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
