It said authorities were still trying to determine the cause of the accident. \n“It happened on a curve, so the bus flipped and that could be due to excess speed,” said Tu Bing-cheng, a Taipei city official. “The whole frame of the bus changed shape, got crushed and left no openings.” \nMany passengers were trapped under the crushed bus, and rescue personnel used a crane to pry the vehicle open. \nThirty-two people, all Taiwanese, were confirmed dead and the remaining passengers were sent to hospitals for treatment, Tu said. \nThe bus belonged to a private company, he said. It was taking tourists back from a trip to see cherry blossoms when it crashed, Taipei city Deputy Mayor Teng Chia-ji said. \nA bus accident in Taiwan last July killed 26 tourists from mainland China, raising concern from officials in Beijing about travel safety. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:17.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
