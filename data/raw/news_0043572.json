You’ll pay extra to check a wheeled bag. \nUpgrades are not permitted, regardless of elite status level, and the tickets are non-refundable, non-changeable. \nBasic economy fares were introduced by Delta Air Lines in response to growing competition from discounter Spirit Airlines. United Airlines says it will test the concept in Minneapolis. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.   rewritten, or redistributed.
