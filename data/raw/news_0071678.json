Instead of buying my kids the latest Jordans or fancy electronics I paid my rent for the YEAR,\" wrote Knaack. \"I'm a single mom and I do it all buy myself on a minimum wage job. I kno [sic] that a roof over my kids' head is what's important. My kids don't want for anything because my priorities are straight. And this also means I will have that extra 450 a month to do things with my kids.\" \nPeople sent all kinds of comments to Knaack, some positive and others not so much. \n(Story continues below) \nMistakes on tax returns can cost you time and money, so it pays to keep them to a minimum. Media: MediaOS Video \nMany commentors posted things like \"good job\" or \"smart thinking\" or a short congratulatory comment. \n\"What about not having children until you make more than minimum wage?\" said another comment \nOther posts suggested she should have started saving towards a house, while others still seemed unimpressed that she was just doing the obvious \"adult\" thing. \nNo matter their opinions, Knaack is still proud of her decision. \n\"I made [the post] public so if anyone shared it, others could see it in hopes a recovering addict would see it and see that life off the streets is possible and for any single moms to kno [sic] it is possible to survive on ur [sic] own. As long as my post has inspired people I'm happy with that.\" Latest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.
