It’s a horrible, horrible world out there.” \nTragic: MP Jo Cox pictured on her wedding day (Jo Cox Foundation/PA) \nMs Abbott , who has represented Hackney North and Stoke Newington since 1987 when she became the first black woman to be elected MP, said she has suffered personally from abuse directed her way, the Guardian reported. \nShe said Facebook and Twitter should do more to stop people sending racist and sexist abuse and called for a parliamentary inquiry to see what else could be done to ensure internet providers take action. \nAllies: Jeremy Corbyn, MP for Islington North, and Diane Abbott, who represents Hackney North and Stoke Newington.
