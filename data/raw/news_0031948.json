But how do you face the fury of online radicalisation and recruitment of youngsters who are misled with misquoted verses and other sacred statements. By quoting the right verses with their proper contexts and interpretations, of course. This is exactly what the famous Mahim Dargah , in collaboration with Goregaon-based Madrassa Darul Uloom Faizan-e-Raza , is doing. \n\nThey are fighting the terrorist outfit Daesh or Islamic State (IS) through social networks and helping stop youths from getting swayed by extremist propaganda. \n\nAround eight months ago, Mahim Dargah 's managing trustee Sohail Khandwani, the Goregaon madrassa's founder Mufti Mohammed Manzoor Ziyaee and others brainstormed on how to fight fake jihadis, who hunt for recruits in cyberspace by misquoting and twisting scriptures. \n\n\"The Dargah created an App, a Facebook page, a blog, Twitter and WhatsApp accounts. Since ISIS also approaches youths with Quranic verses and Hadiths (sayings of Prophet Muhammad), we decided that Mufti Ziyaee would respond to such propaganda by quoting verses and Hadiths with their correct contexts and interpretations,\" says Khandwani. \n\nMufti Ziyaee quotes several Quranic verses which terrorist groups use to provoke their followers. A frequently-quoted Quranic verse (9:5) goes: \"When the forbidden months have passed, kill the polytheists (who are at war with you) wherever you find them.\" \n\n\"This verse is presented as if it is a command to kill the kafirs wherever they are. The right context of the verse needs to be understood,\" says Mufti Ziyaee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:59:34.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
