Social media has long been a place for customers to voice their discontent with companies. \nWhat is relatively new is the highly political nature of the anger and the fact that this fury is coming from both sides of the aisle. \nCompanies like Amazon are caught in the middle. So far, the social media outrage has failed to hurt Amazon. Analysts are predicting a huge increase in the company’s fourth quarter sales, which the retailer will report on Thursday. \nJEFF BEZOS of Amazon, made promises to Trump about jobs but now he is changing his mind trying to sue on immigration EO.
