Editor Advertisement \nAnother monster employer caught and sentenced in the courts today. This time, it is a Singapore PR, Jacob Kumar Ross B. Isaac Ross, who started molesting his Filipino maid shortly after she started work for the monster's family in November 2015. \nThis monster even had the cheek to tell her that he wants her \"by the end of the month\" in January 2016. You hire a maid to help you with the housework, not to take advantage of her! How do you expect maids to work under such conditions, where they are worried for their life, especially with a monster employer whose main aim is to molest and have his way with her. Maid and employer live under the same roof, so imagine the kind of stress and fear the maid has to live through! \nThe monster a senior security specialist, was sentenced to 11 months' jail and three strokes of the cane. Just revoke his PR and send him back where he came from once he finish his jail sentence! \nAnnie P \nA.S.S.
