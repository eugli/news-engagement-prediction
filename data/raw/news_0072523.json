\nIf DAP and DAP leaders were anti-Malay and anti-Islam, would Nik Aziz have visited the then DAP National chairman Karpal Singh in his Penang house on Thaipusam in January 2013, where Nik Aziz’s 82nd birthday was also celebrated with a “Pakatan Rakyat” birthday cake? \nWhy did things change so radically in PAS after Nik Aziz’s death in February 2015? \nIf Nik Aziz is alive, I do not think PAS would have any hesitation in joining the patriotic movement of political parties and NGOs to Save Malaysia from becoming a “global kleptocracy” and hurtling towards the trajectory of a failed and rogue state. \nIn fact, if Nik Aziz is alive, PAS would be in the forefront to demand full accountability and transparency of the international multi-billion dollar 1MDB kleptocratic money-laundering scandal, instead of having the PAS president cozying up with the Umno president with the shocking stance that it does not matter whether Malaysia is a global kleptocracy so long as the prime minister is a Muslim. \nAlthough the charade in the last 48 hours is allegedly to be from Selangor PAS grassroots who submitted a memorandum to the PAS leadership to cut off ties with any party which has relations with DAP and Amanah, nobody would be surprised if this memorandum and the posters attacking DAP, Amanah and Bersatu leaders, Amanah and Bersatu, were the “masterpieces” of the PAS information chief. \nHiding behind S'gor grassroots \nThe attacks on the DAP, AMANAH and Bersatu amounted to an open declaration of war by PAS leadership against DAP, Pakatan Harapan and Bersatu. \nAlthough the whole charade the PAS leadership attack on the DAP, Amanah and Bersatu, is couched as coming from the Selangor PAS grassroots, the real scenario is very different. \nIn fact, PAS grassroots in Selangor have been very upset and restive about the Hadi PAS leadership’s hardline stand in cozying up with the Najib leadership of Umno, defending Najib from the 1MDB kleptocratic money-laundering scandal. \nThis explains the extraordinary statement by the PAS vice president, Iskandar Abdul Samad before the PAS central committee meeting last week that even the PAS central committee and PAS syura council decided to sever ties with PKR, PAS Selangor state executive councillors, members in GLCS, councillors and village heads will not resign until a PAS muktarmar decision in April. \nPAS Selangor is likely in the next general election to lose all the 15 state assembly seats it won in Selangor the 13GE, as voters, both Muslim and non-Muslim, are disappointed with the new direction of the Hadi-led PAS leadership. \nI believe Nik Aziz would have no problem in endorsing my statement and vision that Malaysians cannot and should not be anti-Malay or anti-Chinese, anti-Indian, anti-Kadazan or anti-Iban or anti any religion, or we would have betrayed the Malaysian vision which regards every Malaysian, regardless of race, religion, region, class, gender or age as one Malaysian people. \nBut Hadi is very different, and I will be extremely surprised if he is able to publicly endorse such a statement and vision. \nUmno, PAS voter awake \nIn my message to the Konvensyen Reformis Malaysia 2017 over the weekend, I referred to three immediate challenges not only to the Reformasi people, but to all patriotic Malaysians who want to save Malaysia from becoming a global kleptocracy and ending up as a failed and rogue state. \nThese three national challenges in the 14th GE expected to be held either in the second or third quarter of this year, are: \nFirstly, to preserve and sustain the electoral support for reform from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Kadazan and Dayak voters for DAP and PKR in the 13th general election; \nSecondly, to reach out and win over the 3.5 million Umno members and Umno voters to support the Save Malaysia Campaign in the battle between “Democracy versus Kleptocracy”; \nThirdly, to reach out and win over the PAS members and voters to support the Save Malaysia campaign to ensure the victory of democracy and the defeat of kleptocracy in the 14th general election and to keep alive the memory and spirit of Nik Aziz. \nIf we can achieve these three tasks in the 14GE, then Malaysia can be saved and we can look forward to a new dawn in Malaysia with institutional and systemic reforms to ensure that Malaysia will never return to the trajectory of a kleptocracy and a failed and rogue state. \nLIM KIT SIANG is DAP parliamentary leader and MP for Gelang Patah \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:21:34.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
