Speaking of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) on gas connection, the Prime Minister said millions of women have been benefited under the central government scheme. \n\n\"Till now 1.75 crore people have been given free gas connection and they have been saved from the hazardous smoke that choked their lungs,\" he said amid cheers. \n  More from Uttar Pradesh Election BJP bigwigs to drive campaign in last 3 phases from Varanasi Campaign for phase-V of UP polls to end tomorrow UP polls 2017: Campaigning at its peak but not for Mulayam Singh Yadav UP polls 2017: Rivals hold fire as PM shoots darts Centre hits back with data to short-circuit UP's power talk", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:52:17.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
