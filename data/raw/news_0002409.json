Nights could be even colder. Image: Attila Balazs / EPA \nFrom Monday onwards Finland is set for a blast of winter, with some parts of the country to expect extreme cold. Even in the south temperatures are expected to dip as low as 20 degrees below zero, but elsewhere things might be even colder. \nFrom Monday onwards a strong high pressure system is forecast to move in across Finland, according to Yle meteorologist Toni Hellinen. On Monday the mercury will go down to -10 degrees everywhere, with -25 forecast for eastern Finland. \nOn Tuesday things are likely to get even colder, with daytime highs of -20 degrees in the south and -25 in the centre of the country. \nNight time temperatures will be even lower, but Hellinen says that northern Finland will at the start of the work be a little milder. \nAs of Thursday, the forecast is for the harshest cold to ease a little towards the end of next week.
