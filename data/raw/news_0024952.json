Elizabeth Warren gets told to sit down for reading a letter meanwhile in Australia they are calling people parasites and basically turning the session into a roast. Every body in the chamber chairs just yucking it up. Point and laughing and whathaveyou. \nCan you imagine Mitch McConnell’s ole turtle face lookin ass if we allowed our Senate to roast him? He might never poke his Master of Disguise Face Ass out in public again. Just let Al Franken take the floor and supply the rest of the Senate with crying emoji signs. It’d be a bipartisan roast. The nation would heal. It’d be fantastic. Fantastic for everyone except this box turtle boy. \nThat being said, I have no problem drinking someone else’s Cristal and sucking on their teets to get it; keeping my legs tucked under the table in order to sip at the bottle (whatever that means. I kinda think it means blow job). Cristal aint cheap and your boy likes to live in luxury.
