POSITIVE REACTION \nThat was at the Survivor Series pay-per-view, as WWE reportedly feared the Toronto crowd would boo him rather than cheer him on. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Article continues below \nAccording to Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter , another reason for Goldberg’s immense success right now is because of someone else entirely. GETTING HELP \nMeltzer was reviewing Goldberg’s segment from Monday Night Raw earlier this week, where he added himself to the List of Jericho, before challenging Owens to a match for the red championship – which Jericho accepted on his behalf. \nMeltzer went on to reveal something very interesting, that Lesnar’s advocate Paul Heyman is the man behind Goldberg’s success. \nHe noted: “It’s a little known fact that the person pretty much responsible for everything Goldberg related is [Paul] Heyman, which may explain why Goldberg’s promos are so much better than anyone imagined they’d be.” \nIt’s certainly interesting to know that Heyman is the one helping Goldberg go over, but it comes as no surprise as he’s obviously the key to selling this feud one last time. \nMeltzer is also correct, nobody thought Goldberg could still talk the way he does, after so much time away from the ring. \nWhat do you make of the fact that Goldberg is being helped by Paul Heyman?
