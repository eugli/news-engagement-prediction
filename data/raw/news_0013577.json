Having Drake‚Äôs producer in the pic only adds weight to our theory. \nNineteen85 clearly thought the moment worth sharing. He also posted the picture to Instagram, this time with the caption ‚ÄúCulture.‚Äù A photo posted by Nineteen85 (@nineteen85_) on Feb 4, 2017 at 6:46am PST \nDrake‚Äôs appreciation for Glover isn‚Äôt exactly unique, the guy is beloved by many ‚Äî so much so, in fact, that we did some digging to see if anyone on Twitter is talking shit on one of Hollywood and Hip Hop‚Äôs fastest-rising stars. \nSleuths that we are, we Twitter searched the phrase ‚ÄúDonald Glover sucks‚Äù and guess what we found: I know it sucks to be a Falcons fan rn but Donald Glover didn't make a show about fuckin Massachusetts.
