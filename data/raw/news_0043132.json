Now, the 19-year-old is a father to his first child. \nAccording to Zion's father, Rohan Marley, Zion welcomed his baby boy Zephaniah last week. Quoting Zephaniah 3:16, Marley used the Bible verse to confirm the news on Twitter on Sunday (Feb. 19). \n“In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack,” read the tweet, adding, “JAH BLESSINGS ‘WE GIVE THANKS FOR LIFE Welcome to Earth Little ZEPHANIAH NESTA.” \nZion is the eldest of five children between Hill and Marley. The other four include Sarah, Selah, John, and Joshua. \nBillboard has reached out to Hill's rep for comment.
