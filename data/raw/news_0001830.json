But it said the true figure could be even higher because of under-diagnosis and the presence of other, as yet unknown, faulty genes. \nAround 12 people aged 35 or under die every week from heart conditions with no apparent explanation, mostly due to these inherited conditions. They can affect people of any age, and children have a 50% chance of inheriting the faulty gene from a parent who carries it. \nBHF says that most people affected remain undiagnosed and unaware of the risks to their health, and the possibility they could pass on such conditions to their children. \nLast April, the former England and Nottinghamshire batsman James Taylor was forced to retire at the age of just 26 after scans revealed he had ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy), an inherited condition caused by a change or mutation in one or more genes. \nThe progressive condition causes heart muscle to be replaced by fibrous tissue and fat so the ventricle becomes thin and stretched, meaning the heart does not pump blood around the body properly and there is an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest. \n“It is safe to say that being diagnosed with ARVC was the toughest and scariest week of my life,” Taylor said. “I never would have thought it would happen to me. I was 26 years old and playing cricket for England but my condition meant that I was at risk of sudden death from a cardiac arrest. \n“I was lucky as my condition was detected early and despite having to give up my career, with medication I can lead a relatively normal life.” \nBHF says it needs to conduct more research to detect and treat conditions like the one that affects Taylor, to make sure that the hundreds of thousands of people who are unaware they are affected can get the treatment they need. \n“The reality is that there are hundreds of thousands of people across the UK who are unaware that they could be at risk of sudden death,” the charity’s medical director, Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, said. \n“If undetected and untreated, inherited heart conditions can be deadly and they continue to devastate families, often by taking away loved ones without warning.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T14:30:54.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
