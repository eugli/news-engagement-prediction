What is a defibrillator? A defibrillator is an electrical device that delivers a shock to the heart. The aim of the shock to the heart muscle is to re-establish the heart's rhythm and regularly beat. How does it work? Pads from the defibrillator are placed on the patient's chest and a built-in computer checks the victim's heart rhythm. The device determines whether a shock is needed. Most devices have an automated voice to tell the rescuer the next step, for example stand clear and press the device's shock button. \nPeople are being urged to use the machines, even if they are untrained, with the Heart Foundation saying they are \"completely safe to use\". \nA number of defibrillators will be located in Rundle Mall and Victoria Square. \nThe City Council already has defibrillators for use by staff at Adelaide Aquatic Centre, the Town Hall, Central Market and its golf links. \nHeart Foundation chief executive Imelda Lynch said the first few minutes of a heart attack were critical to a person's survival. \n\"If you defibrillate somebody who is having a cardiac arrest within the first five minutes you have a 90 per cent chance of success and survival rates,\" she said. \nThe machines come with recorded verbal instructions. \n\"You cannot hurt someone. In fact the worst thing you can do with this is not use it.\" Adelaide City Councillor Phil Martin said. \nPreviously, defibrillators have been kept on business premises, making them inaccessible outside of office hours. \nAs part of the trial, these defibrillators will be placed in more public locations. \n\"Sudden cardiac arrest happens at any time of the day or night, it's not restricted to office hours or shopping hours.\" Councillor Martin said. \nHeart disease is the leading cause of death across Australia and Ms Lynch said women especially underestimated its prevalence. \n\"Women think that heart disease is a man's disease and it's absolutely not,\" she said. \n\"Women have as many heart attacks as men.\" \nCouncillor Martin is pushing for the trial, if successful, to be rolled out across Adelaide. \n\"At just $2,000 dollars a machine it is cheaper than the cost of hospitalising people, and it's much cheaper than a funeral,\" he said.
