Fret not. Here, a gathering of what the stars have been up to this week on social media. \n\"Shrobing\" Is Back \nSpotted on tastemakers like Eva Chen, Bryan Boy and Caroline Vreeland, the half-off/half-on street style \"lewk\" is catching on. For Spring 2017, Balenciaga creative director Demna Gvasalia showed oversized jackets, draped to be worn off-the-shoulder. Kim Kardashian rocked the avant-garde look last fall at Paris Fashion week before her unfortunate robbery. ASAP Rocky, styled by Matthew Henson, rocked the look at NYFW while heading into Raf Simon’s inaugural Calvin Klein show. Other rappers like Travis Scott and Kanye West have long favored the look. But, keep in mind this look causes \"T-Rex arms,\" and will not keep you warm. Thirtysomethings may recall primary school days when the cool kids rocked their Starter jackets off-the-shoulder...what goes around comes back around.

His devastatingly handsome face has been hard to ignore – until journalist Joe Reid tweeted out a photo of something else. You’re welcome! — Joe Reid (@joereid) February 22, 2017 \nCate Blanchett, Drag Queen \nCate Blanchett’s fierceness never ceases to amaze. The Oscar-winning actress went full drag at Greenwich Village’s legendary Stonewall Inn, birthplace of the gay rights movement in NYC. The actress looked incredibly glamorous while lip-synching Dusty Springfield’s “You Don’t Own Me.” How far we've come, it was once illegal to serve men alcohol that were going to dance together, if you can believe that. Feb 20, 2017 at 6:20pm PST \nBarack's Back \nPresident Obama treated his daughter Malia to dinner at Soho hot spot Emilio’s Ballato this week. Malia Obama currently resides in NYC, working as an intern at the Weinstein Company. The former President, fresh off a vacation, has never looked better, happily posing for a photo with staff. He was greeted by a crowd of 100+ supporters, clapping and reminding him that he is missed. Feb 23, 2017 at 6:55pm PST Feb 23, 2017 at 8:19pm PST \nCaitlyn Jenner Has Some Words for Donald \nHigh profile Republican and transgender star Caitlyn Jenner wants President Trump to call her for help with his growing problem with the LGBT community in the wake of a decision to rescind an order allowing transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. Jenner ends her video plea telling Trump to call her, and with a warning: \"See you in Court!\" A post shared by Caitlyn Jenner (@caitlynjenner) on Feb 23, 2017 at 5:17pm PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:29:59.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
