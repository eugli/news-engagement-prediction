The AFP ICU was “10 metres maximum, in the same corridor” from the room where Kehazaei was taken.\n“I can imagine that we would have been able to avoid, that we would have had a good chance to avoid, this medical disaster.\n“For sure, we would have been able to stabilise this patient, and I’m sure we would have been able to avoid the cardiac arrest before transferring this patient to Brisbane .”\nGlied said despite Kehazaei being clearly critically ill from the moment he was admitted to Pacific International hospital ,he was left unattended for significant periods of time.\n\n“They [the PIH] had good doctors who had the knowledge, but they were not present. And you cannot treat this patient on the phone.\n“I cannot understand why they left that patient with the nightshift doctor, who has to deal with the emergency department, and the ward patients.”\nThe Pacific International hospital has declined to cooperate with the coronial investigation into Kehazaei’s deaths.\nBut doctors from the hospital, in correspondence revealed before the coroner, alleged it was International SOS’s “AFP team” who were responsible for the flaws in Kehazaei’s care, by interrupting his ventilation and interfering in his care.\nHamid Kehazaei inquest exposes failures of Australia's secretive immigration regime Read more \nKehazaei was responsive and had a central pulse, albeit weak, when he was first admitted to PIH. However, he suffered up to three cardiac arrests overnight on 26 August at the hospital, before being stabilised through resuscitation.\nOn the morning of 27 August, he was unconscious, scoring three out of 15 on the Glasgow coma scale, the lowest possible result.\n“The patient was totally nonreactive … even to severe pain and both pupils were fixed and dilated – not even reacting to any strong light, which is a very deep reflex,” Glied said. “The patient showed early signs of the development of brain death.”\nGlied and the country medical director for International SOS, Dr Kalesh Seevnarain, spoke early on 27 August about Kehazaei’s prognosis.\n“At handover Dr Glied and Dr Seevnarain discussed the patient’s condition and decided that if the patient went into cardiac arrest he would not be resuscitated as they were of the view that he was neurologically dead,” the coroner heard in evidence. Kehazaei was medevaced to Brisbane on 27 August, but never regained consciousness, and died a week later.\nThe inquest, before Queensland state coroner Terry Ryan, continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:16:37.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
