She says she can't afford to live closer to Sydney. \n\"It is also important to work at the weekend to make up for the extra cost of travelling to and from Sydney,\" she said. \n\"If I don't get the penalty rates for working on Sunday, there is no point working on Sunday for me. \n\"I may as well change my career and work Monday to Friday.\" Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:36:05.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
