Last month, as I sat in an elegant hotel bar in Rome, I caught myself wondering if there can be such a thing as too much magnificence in a single place. With its antiquity (“Just go to the Colosseum, face east and shout, ‘Moira,’ ” my friend joked when I asked how to get to her house), its art and its food, Rome nearly overwhelmed me with its aesthetic and alimentary too-much-ness. Aperitivo time is the perfect antidote to all that. During that blessed and blissful hour (or two, or three) of easygoing snacking and drinking and talking, time slows, and stress slips away. In Rome, I met the local author — and aperitivo enthusiast — Elizabeth Minchilli, whose most recent book is “Eating Rome.” “I love aperitivo time in Rome because it can be anything you want,” she told me. “It’s that in-between time of day — not work, not dinner — when you can meet as few or as many friends for as long or as short as you like and drink as much or as little as you like. Many other ‘meals’ in Italy have so many rules. But with aperitivo, it’s a social opportunity that you can put your own spin on.” Yes, you may drink as much or as little as you wish, but during aperitivo time, no one seems to drink too much. Drunkenness is not the objective, and it helps that many of the favored drinks are relatively low in alcohol: a glass of wine, a spritz of some kind. In the latter category, Moira’s husband, Damiano Abeni, introduced me to the Pirlo, a classic from his native Brescia in northern Italy. The recipe is as simple as it gets: Campari and a dry, sparkling white wine — ideally Pignoletto frizzante. Among aperitivi , there’s a place for stronger stuff, too, in the form of classic Italian cocktails — just sipped a bit more slowly. That elegant hotel bar I found myself in was the Stravinskij at the Hotel de Russie, where, with exceptional grace and premium ingredients, a bartender made me an exemplary Negroni that cured me of my Negroni fatigue and reminded me of the drink’s charms. I also like the Negroni variant called the Cyn-Cyn, which calls for Cynar instead of Campari, and is a favorite of Elizabeth’s. And the effects of drink are always mitigated by the presence of food: Good, salty cheese, cured meats, bread and olives frequently appear, but I had pizza, and even sashimi, at aperitivo gatherings. The ritual is equally unfussy at home in a small group before dinner or in a crowd at a bar. The snacks at the Stravinskij were more rarefied — salmon and other seafood — than the usual aperitivo offerings, but the relaxed, leisurely pace remained.

Aperitivo time is among the most civilized drinking traditions I’ve ever witnessed. There is no pressure, no pretension: It’s all unhurried, unforced pleasure. “Piano, piano,” they say in Rome. Slowly, gently. Recipes: C yn-Cyn | Pirlo \nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of The New York Times Magazine delivered to your inbox every week.
