(Roger Cosman/CBC) \nProvincial curling icon Heidi Hanlon and her three teammates will be inducted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame this May, along with six other people of different sports backgrounds. \nHanlon, whose 30-year career includes provincial, national and world titles, said the honour announced Thursday is what anyone who seriously participates in a sport would want. \n\"We know it's difficult to get into the Sports Hall of Fame,\" she said. \"And for us to still be competing and to get nominated for the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame is a dream come true.\" Growing popularity of sport \nHanlon said she started curling in Grade 7 in her hometown of McAdam. \nThe sport was not popular with youth back then but has since developed a strong following, and not just in New Brunswick. There are now professional curlers worldwide, many coached by Canadians, she said. \n\"Now that it's in the Olympics, so many countries are curling,\" she said.

(CBC) \nHaving won several titles, as well as 15 Scotties Tournament of the Hearts national competitions, Team Hanlon has kept curling one of the highlights of New Brunswick sports, she said. But it was not always easy. \nThe Saint John team, which includes Kathy Floyd, Jane Arsenau and Judy Blanchard, had to fight hard to keep winning and competition was fierce, she said. \n\"After we don the first few provincials, you are the team to beat,\" she said. \"That kept us going. We knew everybody was going to keep us on our toes.\" 2017 inductees \nThe other inductees for the annual Sports Hall of Fame members are: Kimberly Adams-Tattrie of Tide Head, the first New Brunswicker to win a professional golf tournament at the Futures Tour in Lakeland, Fla., and one of the most decorated golfers in Canada.
