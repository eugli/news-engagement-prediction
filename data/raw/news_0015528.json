Now 21, he lives in Sweden. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Speaking in an interview from Stockholm via Skype, Alshogre described how he was forced to keep his eyes closed and his back to the guards while they abused or suffocated a cellmate. The body often would be left behind, or there would be a pool of blood in the cell for other prisoners to clean up. \"We can tell from the sound of the prisoner as he dies behind us. He dies a meter away. I don't see anything, but I see with my ears,\" said Alshogre, who at age 17 moved among nearly 10 detention facilities in Syria for two years before he was taken to Saydnaya. Alshogre survived nine months in the prison, paying his way out in 2015 — a common practice. He suffered from tuberculosis and his weight fell to 35 kilograms (77 pounds). Two cousins detained with him in western Syria didn't survive, dying a year apart in a military intelligence detention facility. The younger one died in Alshogre's arms, deprived of food and so weak he was unable to walk to the bathroom on his own. Still, Alshogre said nothing could have prepared him for Saydnaya. At one point, Alshogre was called out by his guards \"for execution,\" he said. He was brought before a military trial and told not to raise his gaze at the judge, who asked him how many soldiers he had killed. When he said none, the judge spared him. Death in Saydnaya was always present, \"like the air,\" Alshogre said. Once when he was deprived of food for two days, a cellmate handed him his food ration — and died days later. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story \"This is someone who gave me his life,\" he said. Another cellmate died of diarrhea, also common in the prison. \"Death is the simplest thing. It was the most hoped for because it would have spared us a lot: hunger, thirst, fear, pain, cold, thinking,\" he added. \"Thinking was so hard. It could also kill,\" said Alshogre, who keeps a photo of one of his tormentors on the wall of his home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:59:44.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
