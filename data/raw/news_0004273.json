Since his first book was published, in 1962, when he was 32 and living in Paris, he had become a cult figure, more so to non-English-speaking fans abroad than in his native United States. In its interview with him, The Paris Review said Mr. Mathews “rightfully belongs to the experimentalist tradition of Kafka, Beckett and Joyce.” \nAdvertisement   Mr. Matthews said he was originally inspired to write to fulfill Henry James’s dictum “lust to know.” But he left some baffled readers who had persevered through his unconventional prose still lusting to know what, if any, deeper meaning he had hoped to convey. “In ‘The Conversions,’ ‘Tlooth’ and ‘The Sinking of the Odradek Stadium,’” he once said, “the narrators are all trying to solve some riddle or mystery and are overcome by an obsessive conviction that they will be able to find a definitive answer, but it all falls apart.” For decades, Mr. Mathews was the sole American member of Oulipo, the quirky French literary salon where authors and mathematicians practice what they call constrained writing: forcing themselves to follow contrived formulas — for example, using specific words or leaving out certain letters. (Oulipo is short for “ouvroir de littérature potentielle,” or “workshop of potential literature.”) He qualified for the group unwittingly, he recalled, after engaging in a particularly challenging word game: He rewrote Keats’s poem “La Belle Dame Sans Merci” by using the vocabulary from a Julia Child recipe for a cauliflower dish, and vice versa. What some might see as completely pointless, he found intellectually liberating. “I gave myself the task of writing a story using the 185 words that were found in 46 proverbs,” he told The Paris Review. “This is a forbiddingly small vocabulary. It was hard to know what to do with them. Then I started putting words together, and a few words would lead to a sentence, and then eventually it became this sweet love story. It was as though you were wandering through a jungle and suddenly you came into a clearing that is a beautifully composed garden. It’s extraordinary, the feeling it gives you.” In a pot vs. kettle competition, another Oulipian, Georges Perec, who wrote a novel, appropriately called “A Void,” without ever using the letter “e,” suggested that Mr. Mathews abided by rules of writing “from another planet.” But the author Daniel Levin Becker, now the only surviving American member of Oulipo, explained in The San Francisco Chronicle this week that Mr. Mathews’s unruly, inventive use of language was just as important as his novels’ plots. “Literature, for Harry Mathews, and in turn for his dauntless reader,” Mr. Becker wrote, “is enriched by prizing process over product, curiosity over certainty.” \nAdvertisement   Harry Burchell Mathews was born in Manhattan on Feb. 14, 1930. His father, Edward J. Mathews, was an architect who contributed to the design of Rockefeller Center and helped establish the New York City Planning Commission. His mother, the former Mary Burchell, was an arts patron who had inherited a real estate fortune. He was raised on Beekman Place and attended the private St. Bernard’s School, where, he said, he wrote his first serious work, a poem, when he was 11: It was a sad autumnal morn The earth was but a mass of clayOf foliage the trees were shornLeaving their branches dull and gray. He graduated from the Groton School in Massachusetts, dropped out of Princeton in his sophomore year to join the Navy and graduated from Harvard in 1952 with a bachelor’s degree and a master’s in music and musicology. He said he learned a lot about narrative writing from comic books (“lots of invention and no pretense of realism”) but deliberately avoided college courses in literature. “Literature was my great love,” he told The Paris Review, “and I was determined to keep it unsullied by academia.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
