(AP) â€” An intentionally set fire damaged a prayer hall at a Tampa-area mosque early Friday, investigators said. The arson occurred at the Islamic Society of New Tampa, Hillsborough County Fire Rescue said in a news release.\nFire investigators responded at around 2 a.m. After gathering evidence, they determined the fire was intentionally set. No one was at the mosque when the fire started.\n\"It is worrisome that our community has fallen victim of what appears to be another hate crime,\" said Wilfredo Amr Ruiz, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Florida.\nAn alarm company notified a mosque board member early Friday, and he found first responders there when he arrived, CAIR said.\nInvestigators from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives also responded, the group said. The ATF confirmed its agents were there but said the local fire department was leading the investigation.\nCAIR said the fire started at a door to the prayer hall. There was damage to the door and carpet inside from sprinkler water and smoke.\nAuthorities said holes were found in the door but determined they were not made by bullets, as some had initially feared.\nMorning prayers were moved to another building. Afternoon prayers may be canceled due to the damage to the hall, local news media reported.\nWorshippers were directed to other mosques in the area until the building is repaired.\nThe blaze was at least the second intentionally set fire at a Florida mosque in the past six months. Joseph Schreiber was sentenced to 30 years in prison earlier this month for setting fire to the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce on Sept. 11. It was the same mosque that the Orlando nightclub shooter attended occasionally.\nMustafa Ameen, the Islamic Society of New Tampa's lawyer and spokesman, said this is the first time a fire has been intentionally set at the mosque. He said they're awaiting the outcome of the investigation to better understand the motive, but have been boosted by community support.\n\"We appreciate the entire community standing in solidarity with us,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:12:15.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
