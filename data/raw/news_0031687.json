On Friday Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Federal Minister for Urban Infrastructure Paul Fletcher opened the 'G-Loop\" near Homebush promising light-free access to the M4 for those heading west off Homebush Bay Drive.\nJanuary 27th 2017 17 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ M4 widening complete Penrith MPs petition to scrap M4 toll gains speed Isabell Petrinic, Penrith Press February 13, 2017 6:14pm The West takes the fast lane: Airport and motorway set for leap forward under Gladys Berejiklian’s plans Petition lobbies NSW Government to scrap pay plan LABOR MPS campaigning to have tolls on the M4 motorway scrapped say they are close to their goal of 10,000 signatures.\nSeven MPs, including Blue Mountains MP Trish Doyle, Londonderry’s Prue Car and Mt Druitt’s Edmond Atalla, have been collecting signatures since 2016 calling on the State Government to abolish the toll.\nThe original M4 toll was removed in 2010. The M4 widening project is flagged for a maximum toll of $4.21.\n“We have received an overwhelming response to our petition on the M4 toll,” Ms Car said, adding they are just shy of their goal of 10,000 signatures — enough to trigger a debate in Parliament.\nmedia_camera Long time M4 toll collector Kerry Heys ponders the last days of M4 toll collection in 2010.\n“We anticipate that we will reach 10,000 signatures in the next few weeks,” Ms Car told the Penrith Press .\n“Motorists simply cannot afford an extra $45 a week to get to and from work.”\nMs Car repeated her calls to have the toll removed and for the Government to explore alternative funding models after Gladys Berejiklian was unanimously elected as NSW’s Premier.\nOn the prospects of lowering planned tolls for the road through the $20 billion-plus proceeds from the sales of the electricity poles and wires, Ms Berejiklian told The Daily Telegraph : “As a new government and a new minister we’re always looking at opportunities and how we can deliver things better.”\nmedia_camera Afternoon peak hour traffic on the Russell Street off ramp on the M4 at Leonay, Penrith, in June 2013. media_camera Afternoon peak

projects, who said “there is no change to policy around tolling at this stage”.\nMr Ayres told the Penrith Press the Government will “consider options as the project develops”.\nMs Car said he had “a duty to stand up for his region as the Minister (for Western Sydney and WestConnex), and that starts with fighting to stop the M4 toll which will hurt working families in Western Sydney”.\nShe said one of the single biggest issues raised with her in the community is the reintroduction of the M4 toll.\nmedia_camera Toll operators Rosie Duncan (left) and Joyce Robinson on the last days of the toll in 2010.\nAt present, planned tolls for the WestConnex project include a distance-based charge similar to the M7, with a toll cap of $7.95 on the road.\nWestConnex Action Group spokeswoman Pauline Lockie said: “Now it’s been given its own Minister, that makes it even more critical for Premier Berejiklian to dissolve the Sydney Motorway Corporation, and bring full transparency to the secretive, destructive and expensive WestConnex.”\nmedia_camera The M4 tollgates as they looked before they were removed after 10 years.\nThe Sydney Motorway Corporation says it will undertake a survey of traffic volumes and impacts on the motorway and local road network 12 months after the widening project is completed, to assess impacts.\n“WestConnex will do for Western Sydney what the (Sydney) Harbour Bridge did in connecting the city with the north shore, getting people who need our road network home faster to their families,” assured Mr Ayres.\n■ The M4 Motorway toll was introduced in 1992 as a single-point, cash only toll plaza located immediately west of the Silverwater Road interchange.\n■ The toll was removed on February 16, 2010, after the concession on the M4 Motorway expired.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERS AND NEWS ALERTS", "external_links": ["http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies",
