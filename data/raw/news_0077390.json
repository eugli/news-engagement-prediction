These businesses spend their time and money on marketing activities that are focused on customer acquisition rather than on retaining their regular customers, even though the latter contribute to as much as 80 percent of their revenues. Dhruv Dewan, Krishi Fagwani and Karan Chechani saw an opportunity in the offline space to assist these businesses. They thought to maximise their revenue by providing them with enterprise grade marketing technology that would be simple, easy to use, and affordable. \nDhruv says, “We wanted to utilise the power of mobile and data to help these businesses focus on the right customers and ensure they kept coming back to their store.” \nTogether, the trio founded Hashtag Loyalty in March 2015. Team HashTag Loyalty Founders’ experience and skills \nTwenty six-year-old Dhruv spent two and a half years at Ernst and Young as part of the IT Risk team for financial services.

During his graduation, Karan worked on different aspects of production at the Larsen & Toubro factories in Mumbai. After graduation, he worked with Godrej Appliances as an R&D engineer.

Karan has a keen eye for design, branding and communication. He brings with him expertise in product building and mapping and actively works on product design and planning and marketing. What does Hashtag Loyalty exactly do? \nIt offers a customer engagement and marketing automation solution to local businesses. It currently works with offline businesses in the F&B, wellness and retail sectors. Its solution helps businesses build and manage their loyalty programmes, understand their customers and brings them back again. \nKaran shares, \"In our early ideation stages, we worked on every part of the product but the name, avoiding the topic until we had no choice. Eventually, the three of us locked ourselves in a room and made sure we got out with a name. This enforced lockdown resulted in Hashtag Loyalty (#Loyalty), a non-invasive yet direct reference to what we do. Loyalty is a direct reference for customers to identify with us and what we do. The Hashtag, meanwhile, signifies the digital connect that we are enabling between customers and businesses.\" The company provides its businesses a personalised dashboard. It helps them build and manage their loyalty solutions. Run campaigns via email or SMS to reach out their customers whenever they want to. Auto-engage that helps them set up smart triggers that cover automated communication with their customers throughout their life-cycle. Promotions: A customer acquisition feature that helps them acquire relevant customers from our network. Run a direct one-to-one customer feedback system. Enable partnerships with non-competing businesses in their local neighbourhoods to cross acquire customers.

The retail market in India consists of over 14 million outlets, out of which the organised sector consists of 1.4 million.
