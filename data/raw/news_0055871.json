We've seen everything from exclusive behind-the-scenes content to Jimmy Fallon's homage at the Golden Globes , but now CineFix has given it its famous 8-bit Cinema treatment and turned the musical into a classic video game. Check it out below, but if you haven't seen it, beware of spoilers! \nThis video is admittedly super cute and definitely pokes fun at some of the film's pivotal moments. However, it would've been cool to see more of the memorable sequences, like the impressive opening scene or \"City of Stars\" scene. \nThe Academy Awards are only a few days away and though some of us (me) would love to see Moonlight go home with the Oscar for Best Picture, the frontrunner still appears to be La La Land. If it doesn't win, though, Chazelle can still look back and see his beautiful film immortalized in this 8-bit tribute.
