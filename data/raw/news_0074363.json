The fire was was curtailed within minutes and no one was injured. According to an onlooker, there was a minor delay in dousing the fire owing to an issue with the fire department’s equipment. The Indica, City and Octavia were completely charred in the blaze, whereas damage was restricted to the boot of the i10. \nHere, watch the video below: Fire nr PVR juhu.
