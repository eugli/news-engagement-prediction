He died on the spot,” said county commander Ms Agnes Mudambi. \nThe incident occurred at around 5pm. \nShe said the couple had a troubled history of disagreements and had involved other family members in reconciliation meetings to no avail. \n“The couple’s problems are well known in the village, but it seems the alleged infidelity was the last straw that drove him to suicide,” said Ms Mudambi. \nWIFE’S SCREAMS \nNeighbours who responded to his wife’s screams helped put out the inferno and discovered the charred remains of the victim lying on the bed. \nThe body has been taken to Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital awaiting postmortem. \nPolice have opened investigations into the incident. \nMeanwhile, in the same sub-county, a newborn baby was on Thursday rescued after being dumped in a pit latrine by the mother at Nyagechenche Mixed Secondary School. \nThe mother, an 18-year old form three student, was arrested after throwing the baby girl she had delivered in the pit latrine. \nAccording to a teacher at the school who wished to remain anonymous, students at the school heard the infant crying from a pit latrine when they went to use it. \nRESCUE EFFORTS \n“The alarmed students then informed the administration of their discovery and rescue efforts began immediately,” said the teacher. \nAccording to police commander, Ms Mudambi, the baby was pulled alive out of the latrine after a delicate operation. \n“Our officers were called to the scene to oversee the operation, assisted by villagers and staff in the school. We rushed the baby to Tabaka Mission Hospital where she is receiving treatment together with the mother,” she said. \nMs Mudambi said the mother is in police custody at the hospital. \n“We will be charging the mother with attempted infanticide as soon as she recovers from the delivery at the hospital,” said the police boss.
