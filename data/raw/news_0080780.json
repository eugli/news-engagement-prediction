For now, to get a sense of what the song might sound like, you’ll need to triangulate the missing piece against Prins Thomas ’ and Four Tet ’s early, respective remixes . Neither of those reworks initially sound anything like the other, but listen closely and a handful of shared elements stick out like nuggets caught in a gold panner’s sieve—chief among them a spiraling synth arpeggio and a bright, staccato piano chord. \nWhat’s striking in the case of the Four Tet mix is how thoroughly he’s made the sounds his own. He uses virtually the same bassline as Thomas, but Four Tet gives his remix a quintessentially UK spin. He evokes the buzzing bass of classic techno and drives home the pianos with a firm, declarative wallop. Unlike a lot of Four Tet’s club tunes, though, this one sounds unusually streamlined: His drums are as lumpy as ever, but the arpeggios spin so freely that the whole thing moves like a well-oiled machine. In less than eight minutes, he manages to squeeze in three soaring breakdowns, each one bigger than the last. It all amounts to bold, explosive expressions of energy, and a remix that stands alone as it surges from climax to climax.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:03:53.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
