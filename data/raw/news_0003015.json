She'll be the face of a new fashion jewelry collection, Tiffany HardWear. \n\"In New York, you're born knowing that Tiffany is the best, and that it is where the magic happens. The Brand is definitive and iconic, yet continues to push and evolve with the times,\" Lady Gaga said in a statement. \"To me, Tiffany represents timeless American jewelry.\" \nThe brand is using a little sports synergy to boost its latest product. A 60-second film introducing the line is set to air during Super Bowl LI on Sunday. It's a first for Tiffany & Co., but timely because Gaga is performing at the halftime show. \nPast Legendary Style campaigns have featured stars including Elle Fanning and Lupita Nyong'o. \nThe new collection will be available for limited pre-orders in the United States on Sunday.
