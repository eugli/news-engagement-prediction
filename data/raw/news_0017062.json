They failed to do that, and I got angry [with Angelo].” Hazard out does himself 1:17 \nConte says it doesn’t matter who the target of his wrath is when the match is on the line, though. Anyone can get touched. \nAccording to Conte, that rule applies across the board, including star striker Diego Costa, telling Di Canio: “Look Paolo, in such moments I am capable of killing anybody.” \n“I am such a ‘your death is my life’ kind of person that all manners go out of the window in the heat of the moment: the only thing that matters is winning. But that’s because at the end of the day we’re all working towards the same goal and we are all united.” \nIt’s an interesting philosophy, but it seems to be a successful one. Maybe a little bit of inspirational fear is exactly what Chelsea needed this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:18:55.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
