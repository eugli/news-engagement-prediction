(Picture: Twitter) \nStephy Mavididi joined Charlton on loan last month with a big reputation from Arsenal and the youngster is already turning heads at The Valley. Theo Walcott left red-faced as Arsenal fans slam club for 'disrespectful' gesture \nThe 18-year-old forward is yet to score for Addicks but has shown several glimpses of magic in his three matches in League One. \nMavididi started on the bench in Charltonâ€™s 3-3 draw at Rochdale on Saturday but produced a moment of brilliance after Karl Robinson brought him on for Tony Watt at Spotland Stadium. \nThe teenage speedster picked the ball up inside his own penalty area before jinking his way past five Rochdale defenders who couldnâ€™t get near him. ðŸŽ¥ | Past oneâ€¦ past twoâ€¦ past threeâ€¦ past fourâ€¦ past five! @SMavididi9 almost scored a wondergoal at Rochdale yesterday #cafc pic.twitter.com/YIa1UI3M5G \nâ€” Charlton Athletic FC (@CAFCofficial) February 19, 2017 \nHe fired his shot straight at the goalkeeper, however, and will be disappointed not to have scored what would have been a goal of the season contender.
