Mark Lennihan / AP Images \nNew York City's Waldorf Astoria is one of the most legendary hotels in the world. \nIts suites have hosted every US president since Herbert Hoover, and Hollywood legends Sophia Loren, Elizabeth Taylor, and Frank Sinatra have all at different times called the residential towers home. Countless lavish social events were held in its ballrooms, and its kitchens were the birthplace of red velvet cupcakes and the Waldorf salad. \nLast year the hotel celebrated its 85th anniversary, but it will close indefinitely for renovations on February 28. \nSince 2014, when the property was bought from Hilton Worldwide by the Chinese insurance company Anbang for $1.95 billion, plans for a major overhaul have been on the horizon. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission is working to preserve parts of the interior, and Anbang has agreed to comply , Bloomberg reported in September. Though there are no blueprints to see yet, Anbang is reportedly planning to change most of the rooms into condominiums . \nBusiness Insider recently visited both the hotel and the towers to talk to four employees and hear their firsthand accounts of over 100 years of combined experience there. Their stories, plus the history behind the iconic hotel, are below. View As: One Page Slides The Waldorf Astoria was originally two separate hotels that were created because of a feud between two cousins, William Waldorf Astor and John Jacob Astor IV. The two hotels were next door to one another on Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street. Eventually, the cousins came to a truce, and they connected the hotels with a hallway. The hotels were demolished in 1929 to make way for the Empire State Building, and the Waldorf Astoria name was sold for $1 to Lucius Boomer, who began construction on the hotel's current location.

When it opened in 1931, the new Waldorf Astoria was the tallest and largest hotel in the world. A picture of the Waldorf Astoria hotel taken on February 25, 1953.

Known as \"Oscar of the Waldorf,\" Tschirky collected menus, many of which came from events hosted at the hotel. The menus have since been donated to and preserved by Cornell University.

It's still served today at the famous Peacock Alley, which is one of three restaurants inside the Waldorf Astoria.

Here's one of the suites, which start at $186 a night and can run up to $299 a night. The smallest suites are 450 square feet. The Waldorf Astoria/Facebook The suites in the tower portion of the hotel are larger and even more elegant. This one-bedroom suite, for example, is 500 square feet with a separate living room area, and it starts at $715 a night. The penthouse-style suite can go for up to $4,320 a night. Many notable names have owned condos in this section of the Waldorf Astoria. The Waldorf Astoria/Facebook There are three lobbies at the Waldorf Astoria, each originally meant for a different category of guests. This Park Avenue lobby entrance was meant for women and children, while the Lexington Avenue entrance was meant for men who might want quick access to the Peacock Alley lounge, which was smoking-friendly. The entrance on 49th Street is for those staying at the Waldorf Towers. \nSource: Bloomberg Known to colleagues as the \"grandmother of the lobby,\" Sara Ashenafi has been working at the Waldorf Astoria for 38 years. Today, as a lobby ambassador, Ashenafi says she considers the Waldorf her home. Sarah Jacobs Ashenafi's role has shifted over the years — she previously worked as a mail room receptionist and safe-deposit box concierge. She said she fondly remembers many famous guests she's interacted with during her time at the Waldorf Astoria, including Elizabeth Taylor.

According to Ashenafi, Ali would call the lobby and request to speak only to female employees. He was \"very friendly — we just love him,\" she said.

Gerald Herbert/AP Images The man behind the 49th Street entrance is Michael Romei, who's been with the Waldorf Astoria as chief concierge since 1994. Romei has essentially written the book on what a modern concierge should be. In the early '90s, Romei made sure that Frank Sinatra received freshly baked bread from Vesuvio Bakery daily. Romei has helped guests with such absurd requests as arranging a nude skydiving appointment, purchasing bakery equipment and shipping it to Ethiopia, and delivering blood oranges to Mexico for a film project. Sarah Jacobs One of Romei's most memorable times at the Waldorf Towers was meeting the Dalai Lama. \"I was blessed twice by the Dalai Lama, and we had thousands of people outside the hotel burning incense and chanting and throwing flower petals,\" he said. \"He blessed me and gave me one of his prayer clothes, which I still have.\" The Dalai Lama during an interview at the Waldorf Astoria on April 30, 1998. Richard Drew/AP Images Towers concierge David Ibarra has also had a handful of memorable experiences while on staff. Part of the team since 1988, Ibarra came to the Waldorf Astoria after working at Pan Am. He worked closely with Sinatra and Jean MacArthur, Gen. Douglas MacArthur's widow, when they lived at the towers. One of Ibarra's most memorable nights involved going out for a drink with Sinatra at a nearby bar. Sarah Jacobs According to Ibarra, Sinatra's wife had requested that Sinatra be back early. Sinatra \"had a history of getting excited and flinging a chair here and there,\" Ibarra said. \"So we sit down [at the bar] and he is relaxed and everything's fun, and then he goes, 'There's no live music here. Get the manager!'\" Luckily, Ibarra knew Sinatra well, and he mentioned that the manager's wife was expecting a child soon. That changed Sinatra's demeanor completely, and he began reminiscing about fatherhood and raising his own children.

Charles Harrity/AP Images Sonny Koltovski has been working behind the lobby bar, Sir Harry's Champagne Bar, for over 35 years. Koltovski has served several famous guests, including the actor Roger Moore, Keith Hernandez of the New York Mets (who came in with Jerry Seinfeld), The Allman Brothers Band, Kelsey Grammer, and Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. Sarah Jacobs One of his proudest moments was getting his own cocktail, the Waldorf Sunset, which was later featured in Wine Enthusiast magazine. Made with orange juice and white creme de cacao, the drink tastes like a Creamsicle. Koltovski said he \"was focusing more on the ladies\" when he was creating the cocktail. Sarah Jacobs While the future of the hotel and towers are uncertain, they will, without a doubt, continue to hold a place in history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:28:48.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
