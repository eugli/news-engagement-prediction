Two hundred jobs, including 96 prison officer posts, were cut.\nAt the time of the deal, the Prison Officers Association warned it could result in \"escapes and riots\".\nFind out more What’s it like working undercover in a crisis-hit prison? Read Prison Undercover: Reporter Joe Fenton's story:\nIt didn't take too long to realise the inmates were, in effect, running this prison\nHMP Northumberland is a training prison that is meant to offer a range of education and training programmes to prepare inmates for release.\nThe Panorama reporter witnessed some inmates colouring in pictures of the children's cartoon character Peppa Pig in an \"employability skills\" class provided by an outside contractor, Novus.\nIt told Panorama it had investigated these concerns and sent a report to the government.\nThe plain truth is that there are too few prison officers Sir Martin Narey, Former Prison Service head The Ministry of Justice told the BBC: \"The justice secretary has been clear that levels of violence and self harm in our prisons are too high, which is why we are investing an extra £100m annually to boost the front line by 2,500 officers.\n\"These are longstanding issues which will not be resolved in weeks or months but we are determined to make our prisons places of safety and reform.\"\n'Proud of staff' A spokesman for Sodexo said: \"We are proud of those staff at HMP Northumberland who do a professional job in such difficult circumstances.\n\"Security and the safety of our prisoners and staff are our top priority, which is why we have made significant investments in these two areas over and above the contract requirements.\"\nAs part of the investigation, Panorama analysed what prisoners had been saying about safety in prisons across England and Wales.\nPanorama took HM Inspectorate of Prisons data on prisoners' perceptions and analysed it to reveal how fears have changed over the last decade.\nThe data shows that since 2011, there has been a rising trend in the percentage of prisoners who feel that it is easy to get illegal drugs, while the rate of those feeling unsafe also rose between 2011 and 2016. In the five jails with the highest scores for perceived availability of drugs, at least 60% of inmates said they were easily obtainable The prison perceived to be the least safe is Swaleside in Kent, where 69% of inmates reported concerns to HM Inspectorate of Prisons in a report last year Pentonville in north London scored the lowest on availability of prison work in an HMIP survey from two years ago The calculations are a snapshot of what inmates said was happening at the time of the inspection.\nNot every jail is inspected every year and conditions can change rapidly if a new regime or resources are introduced.\nSir Martin Narey, former head of the Prison Service and now a non-executive member of the Ministry of Justice's board, said: \"The plain truth is that there are too few prison officers.\n\"If that reduction in number leads to a lack of confidence, then the great danger is some officers have retreated from interaction with prisoners to the ends of wings.\n\"That's very dangerous for the sort of prison service that we want.\"\n'Disorder reflects anger' Sir Martin believes that Justice Secretary Elizabeth Truss's pledge to recruit more officers would make a difference.\n\"We need to concentrate on recovering their confidence,\" he said.\n\"The disorder we've seen more recently reflects prisoner anger about reductions in regime.\"\n\"If you take people and lock them up and don't use that period to try to do something, then we're just losing a golden opportunity.\"\nWatch Panorama Behind Bars: Prison Undercover on Monday 13 February at 20:30 GMT on BBC One.
