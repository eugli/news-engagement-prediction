'Doesn't get much bigger than that.'\nBut first, the Senate used an unusual pre-dawn vote to approve legislation, 52-47, killing a regulation that has required oil and gas companies to disclose payments to the U.S. or foreign governments for commercial development. The House approved the measure this week, and Trump is expected to sign it.\nScroll down for video\nThe president signed an executive order Friday that will direct the Treasury secretary to review the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law, which reshaped financial regulation after the 2008-09 financial crisis. To his left are Vice President Mike Pence, Congressman Jeb Hensarling and Congresswoman Ann Wagner\nRepublicans said the rejected regulation gives foreign competitors valuable information about U.S. firms and would hurt the economy. Democrats said erasing the requirement means big companies will be able to hide questionable dealings with foreign governments like Russia.\nTrump pledged during his campaign to repeal and replace the Dodd-Frank law, which also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. A senior White House official outlined his executive order in a background briefing with reporters Thursday.\n'Dodd-Frank is a disaster,' Trump said earlier this week during a meeting with small business owners. 'We're going to be doing a big number on Dodd-Frank.'\nThe order won't have any immediate impact. But it directs the Treasury secretary to consult with members of different regulatory agencies and the Financial Stability Oversight Council and report back on potential changes.\nThat likely includes a review of the CFPB, which vastly expanded regulators' ability to police consumer products â€” from mortgages to credit cards to student loans.\nAdministration officials, like other critics, argue Dodd-Frank did not achieve what it set out to do and portray it as an example of massive government over-reach.\nTrump also signed a presidential memorandum Friday that instructs the Labor Department to delay implementing an Obama-era rule that requires financial professionals who charge commissions to put their clients' best interests first when giving advice on retirement investments.\nThe rule, which was set to take effect in April, will be delayed for 90 days while it's reviewed.\nDirection: Steven Mnuchin, who will be Trump's Treasury Secretary once confirmed by the Senate, will be told to review Dodd-Frank\nAs Trump signed the memo, Republican Congresswoman Ann Wagner explained from behind, with the president's permission, 'What we're doing is we are returning to the American people, low- and middle- income investors, and retirees, their control of their own retirement savings.\n'This is about main street, and its been a labor of love for me for over 4 years as chairman...This is a big day, big moment for Americans that care to invest and save,' Wagner said,\nTrump chimed in, 'She means that so much.' The president then gave Wagner the pen, in honor of her hard work.\nThe so-called 'fiduciary rule' was aimed at blocking financial advisers from steering clients toward investments with higher commissions and fees that can eat away at retirement savings.\nCritics argue the rule limits retirees' investment choices by forcing asset managers to steer them to the lowest-risk options.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-03T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:56:55.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
