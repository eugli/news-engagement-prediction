Bone Burnett-produced 2007 debut, The Story , with an all-star tribute album titled Cover Stories: Brandi Carlile Celebrates 10 Years of The Story - An Album to Benefit War Child . The project from Legacy Recordings, due out May 5, will feature newly recorded versions of the 14 songs form Carlile's debut from Adele , Pearl Jam , Margo Price , the Indigo Girls , Dolly Parton and Kris Kristofferson , among others. \nFormer President Barack Obama has even written the foreword to the collection, with all proceeds earmarked for War Child UK , which advocates for children affected by war. The album is available for pre-order on iTunes now. \n“This is a David and Goliath story,” Carlile says in a statement announcing the project. “Since becoming a mother, the reality of a child’s beautiful life being torn apart by war felt like too big of a problem for me. So I asked my heroes and friends to help me launch a rock at the giant that is our refugee crisis and help in the only way we know how, through the power of music... It’s not how hard you can throw, it’s how high you’re willing to aim.” \nWith the exception of Adele's take on \"Hiding My Heart,\" which was recorded as a bonus track to her 2011 album 21, and Ruby Amanfu's \"Shadow of the Wall,\" released in 2015, the new versions were tracked during a series of sessions in 2016. The remakes also feature a number of one-of-a-kind collaborations, including Chris Stapleton playing guitar on Kristofferson's \"Turpentine\" and Miranda Lambert adding backing vocals to Anderson East 's \"Josephine.\" \nCarlile and her longtime bandmates, The Twins (Tim and Phil Hanseroth), will launch a short run of nine tour dates in support of the album called \"An Acoustic Evening with Brandi Carlile Performing 'The Story' in its Entirety and More.\" \n“War Child has a strong and enduring story of harnessing the power of music to support children forced to live with the brutality of war,\" says Rob Williams, CEO of War Child UK. \"This fantastic album will help fund our vital work - from supporting Syrian children to access education, to reintegrating child soldiers in the Central African Republic and working in juvenile justice in Afghanistan.” \nTrack listing for Cover Stories : \n\"Late Morning Lullaby,\" Shovels & Rope\"The Story,\" Dolly Parton\"My Song,\" Old Crow Medicine Show\"Wasted,\" Jim James\"Have You Ever,\" The Avett Brothers\"Josephine,\" Anderson East", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:03:06.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
