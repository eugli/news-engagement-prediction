Now their replay is set to cause problems. \nBefore today only four teams had kept City to a clean sheet. Those were Spurs, Barcelona, Manchester United and Liverpool, with three of those coming back in October. \nPep Guardiola's team are only bettered by Chelsea in terms of goals scored in the Premier League whilst Huddersfield only have a goal difference on +7 despite being third in the Championship as they don't score too many or concede that few. \nSo no one really expected the two sides to play out a 0-0 draw in the FA Cup today. But after they've done that they've caused problems with City's fixture list. \nThe date for the replay, due to be in around 10 days, means that they won't be able to play their derby with Manchester United which will now likely be in April as per BBC's Simon Stone Assume Manchester derby now delayed to end of April at earliest. Only 2 midweeks free of Europe, internationals + Prem fixs to end of season - Simon Stone (@sistoney67) February 18, 2017 \nThe two Manchester clubs were due to play in the league a week tomorrow but with United being in the EFL Cup final next week that game has to be changed. \nThere had been no date for it but City's draw guarantees that there's no time to play it any time soon. \nIt does beg the question as to why any 'big' matches are scheduled for the same weekend as the EFL Cup final. \nThe news will not please Jose Mourinho in his attempts to finish in the top four as United already have to face Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs in the last few weeks of the season. \nCan United finish in the top four?
