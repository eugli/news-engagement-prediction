diplomatic crisis erupted when details of his phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were revealed.\nBut Mr Trump, before a meeting with US steelworkers at the White House on Thursday, blasted the deal negotiated by Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last year with former U.S. president Barack Obama.\n'I have a lot of respect for Australia,' Mr Trump said.\n'I love Australia as a country but I have a problem where for whatever reason President Obama said they were going to take probably well over 1000 illegal immigrants who were in prisons.\n'1250, could be 2000, could be more than that and I said 'Why? Why are we doing this?'.'\nScroll down for video\nDonald Trump slammed the deal to take 1,250 asylum seekers from Australian before a meeting with U.S. steel workers in Washington\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer confirmed the asylum seeker deal would go ahead - but appeared to refer to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull as 'Trumble'\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said refugees will only be allowed in the U.S. if they pass extreme vetting.\nIn a press briefing following Mr Trump's and Mr Turnbull's heated exchange, the Press Secretary appeared to refer to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull as 'Trumble' a number of times.\n'The President had a very cordial conversation with Prime Minister Trumble,' Mr Spicer seems to say.\n'He [Mr Trump] has respect for the Australian people and respect for Prime Minister Trumble.'\nEarlier Mr Trump continued his public stoush with Mr Turnbull by declaring he needs to make 'tough phone calls' because nations are taking advantage of America.\nThe diplomatic crisis erupted after the contents of the first telephone call between Donald Trump and Malcolm Turnbull over a deal signed off by Barack Obama to take 1,250 asylum seekers from Manus and Nauru were revealed.\nTrump accused Malcolm Turnbull of trying to send the 'next Boston bombers' to the United States during their first official telephone conversation. Senior US officials told the Washington Post that Donald Trump abruptly ended the conversation with Mr Turnbull after just 25 minutes - when the pair were meant to speak for an hour.\nThen on Thursday, the President took to Twitter to slam the Obama administration for agreeing to take on the refugees in the first place.\n'Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!,' he wrote.\nDonald Trump slammed Malcolm Turnbull over the proposed asylum seeker deal during their first official telephone conversation (Pictured: Speaking to Malcolm Turnbull)\nAt the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington DC on Thursday, President Trump addressed concerns between the U.S. and Australia and said 'we're taken advantage of by every nation in the world'\nDuring a morning speech in Washington DC, Mr Trump said the world was in trouble but he was 'going to straighten it out'.\n'When you hear about the tough phone calls I'm having, don't worry about it,' Mr Trump told the audience.\n'Just don't worry about it.\n'They're tough.\n'We have to be tough.\n'It's time we have to be a little tough folks.\n'We are taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually.\n'It's not going to happen anymore.'\nThe Washington Post revealed on Wednesday a weekend call between Mr Trump and Mr Turnbull had ended abruptly.\nHowever, Mr Turnbull has denied Mr Trump hung up on him, telling 2GB's Ben Fordham: 'As far as the call is concerned, I'm very disappointed, the report the president hung up is not correct, the call ended courteously.'\nSources claimed President Trump was 'yelling' at Mr Turnbull during the conversation\nOn Thursday afternoon the newly-elected president took to Twitter to slam the Obama administration for making the 'dumb deal' to take on 'thousands of illegal immigrants'\nA fuming President Trump reportedly told Mr Turnbull that the conversation was 'the worst call by far' he had taken that day (Pictured: Speaking to Malcolm Turnbull)\n'When you hear about the tough phone calls I'm having, don't worry about it.

The Obama administration and Turnbull government struck a deal to resettle some of the refugees being held offshore in Nauru and Manus Island in November last year\nThe Australian government has a 'zero tolerance' policy towards illegal boat arrivals and only genuine refugees are sent to Nauru and Manus Island\nThere are approximately 1,250 refugees being held in the Australian-funded offshore detention centres\nA large majority of those refugees come from Iran, Iraq and Somalia - all countries on US President Donald Trump's travel-ban\nPresident Trump reportedly agreed to honour the deal, on the condition the refugees would undergo 'extreme vetting'\nThe US President reportedly described it as the 'worst deal ever' in a heated conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Sunday\nAfter Mr Turnbull apparently suggested they move on and talk about foreign affairs, including the conflict in Syria, President Trump ended the conversation.\n'During call with Australian PM on refugees, Trump pulled phone away from ear and says he wants off call, which ends abruptly per source,' CNN reporter Jim Acosta tweeted.\nUnder the agreement reached with the Obama administration, Australian would take a number of South American refugees, currently in a processing center in Costa Rica, in return.\nThese refugees are predominantly Christian, according to reports.\nIn response to revelations of the hostile phone conversation, Mr Turnbull remained tight-lipped on Thursday and said that he wasn't going to comment.\n'It's better that these things - these conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately. If you see reports of them, I'm not going to add to them,' he said.\nSky News reporter Laura Jayes said Australian government sources who took part in discussions after the call said Mr Turnbull viewed the president as a 'bully'.\n'What I derived from that was Malcolm Turnbull used this phone call to push back,' Ms Jayes said.\n'He wasn't just sitting there being berated by Donald Trump, he talked about how important it was for (Trump) to honour the deal.'\nThe explosive report is a huge embarrassment for Mr Turnbull, who has insisted in recent days the asylum seeker deal is solid and relations with Washington are fine.\nThe United States and Australia have been close military and economic allies for generations, with Australian troops fighting alongside Americans in every military conflict Washington has been involved in since World War II.\nAustralia is one of just four other countries the US shares security intelligence with under the Five Eyes alliance. The two countries have also shared a free trade agreement since 2005.\nPresident Trump described the resettlement agreement as the 'worst deal ever' and said he was 'going to get killed' politically for following through on it (Pictured: Speaking to Malcolm Turnbull)\nIn response to revelations of the phone conversation, Mr Turnbull said on Thursday that he wasn't going to comment and would not be adding to any reports\nCNN reporter Jim Acosta tweeted: 'During call with Australian PM on refugees, Trump pulled phone away from ear and says he wants off call, which ends abruptly per source'\nPresident Trump indicated he was sceptical about what America got out of honouring the deal (Pictured: Speaking to Malcolm Turnbull)\nPresident Trump reportedly ended the conversation after Mr Turnbull suggested they talk about foreign affairs, including the conflict in Syria (Pictured: Speaking to Malcolm Turnbull)\nClose analysis of the President's body-language during the call shows there were signs of bad news to come, as he appears to throw a middle-finger at the camera\nThe official statement about the phone call released by the White House told a different story.\n'Both leaders emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally,' it said.\nMr Turnbull on Monday described the call as constructive, saying the pair acknowledged the already strong and deep relationship between the US and Australia and committed to making it stronger.\n'That's my job. My job is to defend the national interest of Australia and defend the interests of Australians,' he told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday.\n'You may wish to speculate about policies and politics in Washington, that's not my role. My job is today and everyday to stand up for Australia and that's what I do. '\nHe also thanked the president for 'committing' to honour the refugee agreement.\nGovernment sources told CNN that Trump pulled the phone away from his ear and indicated he wanted the conversation to end\nMr Turnbull said the phone call with President Trump ended courteously (Pictured: Speaking to Malcolm Turnbull)\nPresident Trump reportedly ranted about the deal the Obama administration struck with Canberra to take 1250 refugees being held on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island (pictured) and Nauru\nAbout 1.30pm (AEDT) on Thursday the US Embassy in Australia released a statement that the deal would go ahead.\n'President Trump's decision to honour the refugee agreement has not changed and Spokesman Spicer's comments stand,' a spokeswoman said.\n'This was just reconfirmed to the State Department from the White House and on to this Embassy at 13:15 Canberra time.'\nBut it came after a morning of mixed messages from various official sources.\nOn Wednesday it was reported that the White House had backtracked on the asylum seeker deal, saying that President Trump was still considering it.\nWhite House spokesperson Sean Spicer said the deal had not been confirmed.\nHe said if it were to go ahead, it would only be because of the United States' 'longstanding relationship with Australia,' The ABC reported.\nPresident Trump in a meeting with representatives of Harley-Davidson, including CEO Matthew Levatich (right)\nThe explosive report is a huge embarrassment for Mr Turnbull, who has insisted in recent days the asylum seeker deal is solid and relations with Washington are fine\nLast week Mr Trump placed a temporary ban on refugees being admitted to the US and other strict border measures targeting seven countries\n'CRUEL, INHUMAN AND DEGRADING': UN HITS OUT OVER 'OPEN-AIR PRISON' Australia has been heavily criticized by the UN for its policy of sending migrants to offshore detention centers.\nIn November UN investigator Francois Crepeau visited the island of Nauru, where asylum seekers who arrive by boat are sent, and described conditions as 'cruel, inhuman and degrading'.\nMr Crepeau said Australia's policies 'have increasingly eroded the human rights of migrants in contravention of its international human rights and humanitarian obligations'.\nAnd he continued: 'Australia would vehemently protest if its citizens were treated like this by other counties and especially if Australian children were treated like this.'\nAmnesty International said in October that the immigration center was an 'open-air prison'.\nIt comes just one day after Mr Spicer told reporters Mr Trump would honour the 'one-off' deal with former President Barack Obama in November to resettle refugees detained on Manus and Nauru.\n'Part of the deal is they have to be vetted in the same manner that we are doing now.\n'There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them,' he said.\nLast week Mr Trump placed a temporary ban on refugees being admitted to the US and other strict border measures targeting seven countries including Iran, Iraq and Syria.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Trump confirmed his administration would continue to honour the 2016 refugee resettlement arrangement while acknowledging a common interest in preventing irregular and illegal migration.\n'The president, in accordance with that deal to honour what had been agreed upon by the US government, and ensuring that vetting will take place in the same manner that we are doing it now, it will go forward,' Mr Spicer said.\nThe refugees are being held on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island and Nauru.\nSpeaking to reporters at the G'day USA gala in Hollywood, Ms Bishop said Mr Turnbull would travel to the US for a yet to be scheduled meeting with the president.\nForeign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said Mr Turnbull was 'pleased with the outcome' of his discussion.
