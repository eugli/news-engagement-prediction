He said that on an average Jio added seven customers on its network every second. \n2) Ambani announced sharp discounts, even as Jio begins to make its subscribers pay. Without giving details, Jio would remain cheaper, Ambani said. He also vowed to match the tariff data plans of its competitors with 20% more data. \nRead: Mukesh Ambani’s Jio vows to stay cheaper than rest, launches Prime membership \n3) Under the ‘Jio Prime Membership Programme’ for founder members, the existing 100 million plus Jio subscribers can avail unlimited benefits of ‘Jio Happy New Offer’ for another full year or till March 31, 2018 for a nominal, one-time enrolment fee of Rs 99 coupled with an introductory price of Rs 303 per month. The ‘Jio Prime Membership’ is available only for existing customers and the enrolment window will remain open from March 1-31, 2017. Apart from that, he said the company will start offering tariff plans starting April 1 for people who do not opt for the prime membership plan. \nRead: Airtel, Idea shares down after Reliance Jio’s offer announcement \n4) Ambani said that prior to the launch of Reliance Jio, India was ranked 150th in terms of data penetration.

India is number one today in terms of mobile data usage.” \n5) In the coming months, Jio will more than double its data capacity.
