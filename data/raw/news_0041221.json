Photo: Daniel Munoz \nThe court is expected to hear the former Labor powerbroker's appeal against conviction as early as May. \nMr Reynolds said his client should be released on bail pending that appeal. Advertisement \nSupreme Court Justice Robert Beech-Jones knocked back Obeid's first application for bail last year. \nAn appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal in the days before Christmas was also unsuccessful. \nMr Reynolds said the appeal against conviction was \"10 times bigger than most of the things I deal with\" and was likely to raise a \"very major constitutional issue\". \nHe intends to argue that only Parliament, rather than the Supreme Court, has jurisdiction to deal with cases of misconduct in public office. \nThe case may require a bench of five judges rather than the usual three. \nThe Court of Criminal Appeal fixed a tentative date of March 15 to hear the bail application. \nThe parties return to court on March 2.
