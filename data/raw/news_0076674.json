Read More Liam Gallagher launches Twitter tirade on Stockport pub \nEither way, me and my pal decide we’ll step into \"Rkid's\" shoes, by wearing what might be described as tracksuit bottoms. \nAlthough she’s wearing what are most definitely described as GUCCI trainers to try and counterbalance the tracky impact a little. \nBut when we stroll purposefully towards the door on Saturday afternoon at around 6pm, expecting to argue the tracky toss, we find there’s not a door man in sight. \nWe breeze straight into the pub with barely a glance from bar staff - although I do get speared by a stray frisbee from a kid outside. Inside The Elizabethan pub in Heaton Moor (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nIndeed that shapes our first impression upon arrival - lots of families enjoying themselves, tucking into the pub grub, kids running around and almost EVERYBODY is wearing casual jeans and trainers of some description. \nThere’s hardly a designer label in sight, let alone a Gucci bathrobe, and the waiters and waitresses are all dressed in comfy black trainers. Inside The Elizabethan pub in Heaton Moor, Stockport (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nSince JW Lees took over the pub, a former private residence dating back to 1874, it has had a number of refurbishments, and the current interiors are clean and bright, with tartan carpets, portraits of historical figures hang above fireplaces and there are smart tan leather booth areas. Plush decor inside The Elizabethan pub in Heaton Moor (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nBut it’s most definitely still a pub - there’s a rugby match playing on the TV in the main bar area, pie and chips on the menu, and nothing resembling a VIP area. \nI grab one of the waitresses to ask what the deal is with this dress code business and she says it IS strictly no sportswear, but it doesn’t tend to be enforced until 7pm. \nWe buy our drinks and settle at a table close to the bar to keep an eye on who’s coming in and out and exactly what they’re wearing. \nAdmittedly one man does arrive in a dress suit and spats, but by and large people are casually dressed and a friendly-looking bunch. \nEven the pub’s menu gleefully trills: “Be yourself”. An Oasis fan might well retort: “You can’t be no one else”.

It was known as the worst pub in the area, but now it’s one of the best. \n\"I’m sure if you asked any of the regulars around here they’d say how pleased they are because house prices go up if people know there are no problems at the end of their road.” Outside The Elizabethan pub in Heaton Moor (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nOn the door policy, he says: “You need a tool to work with, and I think it’s pretty standard practice at pubs to ask for no sportswear. It can be hard to enforce, but you’ve got to try and keep it. \n“Regulars say well done for sticking to your guns on this issue.” \nI tell Hugh I was expecting to see door staff on our arrival, but he said: “All of my staff have their eyes on you, it’s not just door staff”. Blimey! \nBut it seems our female take on the tracky style met with their approval. \nIsn’t that a bit of a double standard, I ask?

Indeed, when we first published the story about Liam’s twitter rant , many of our readers said that they backed the dress code at the Heaton Moor pub. \nKerry Eaton said: “Rules are rules whether you’re famous or not. Pop home and change like the rest of us do or nip to the shop and buy a pair of jeans or trousers. Well done that staff member.” \nMichael Openshaw added: “Good on the pub for sticking to their rule. Shouldn’t go out in tracksuit bottoms and expect to be taken seriously. Doesn’t matter who you think you are.” Read More Look inside The Mounting Stone in Stockport - the tiny pub you voted the region's best \nTim Workman said: “Well done to the staff at the Elizabethan. But the question that needs to be answered is who the hell goes out for a night out in trackies?” \nLocals also memorably recalled that a certain Mr David Beckham was turned away from The Elizabethan’s door back in the day - for wearing trainers. \nAlthough manager Hugh insists that was definitely not during his era. \nHe chuckles: “That must have been when Beckham was a YTS boy because it wasn’t in the past seven years!” \nAnd he’s happy to confirm: “We haven’t got a problem with trainers, trainers are fine”.
