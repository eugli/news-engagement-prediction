It comes just three months after Eli Lilly announced that it was ending the clinical trial of its Alzheimer's drug solanezumab, after patients taking it demonstrated no signs of improvement compared to those taking a placebo. \"While we are disappointed that a benefit was not observed in this study, our work continues [to study the impact of] verubecestat in people with less advanced disease,\" said Dr Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories. Experts say the failure of the drug on people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's was a substantial setback. \"There were high hopes that [the trial] might succeed,\" Professor John Breitner, Canada research chair in prevention of dementia and professor of geriatric psychiatry and preventive medicine at McGill University told CNN. Read More Can you avoid Alzheimer's? \nWhile two well-established risk factors for Alzheimer's are genetics and aging, \"there is hope that adopting healthy brain life habits might delay or prevent the appearance of Alzheimer's disease,\" the Alzheimer's Association says. Here are some tips: \nStay physically active to maintain good blood flow to the brain and encourage new brain cells. \nEat a \"brain-healthy diet\" low in fat and cholesterol. \nStay social to reduce stress levels and maintain healthy brain cell connections. \nStay mentally active to strengthen brain cells and the connections between them. \"There is a lot of concern and debate in the professional community at this point. It has been very disappointing.\" Around 47 million people currently live with dementia worldwide, with Alzheimer's estimated to account for 60 to 80% of dementia cases. This figure is expected to double every 20 years to reach 131 million people in 2050, according to Alzheimer's Disease International. Years of testing, trials It has now been over a decade since a new drug for alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer's was made available. There is currently no treatment that has been proven to slow the impact of the disease, which causes a gradual decline in memory and thinking skills and eventually leaves sufferers unable to care for themselves. \"We really don't know the causal pathway that causes the loss of connection in the brain that results in the loss of cognitive abilities [in Alzheimer's patients],\" said Breitner. \"Despite 25 years of trying to figure out what is going on and what is the appropriate target for treatment, we still don't know.\" There have been many successful studies that have \"cured\" or reduced memory loss in transgenic lab animals such as rats, which have been bred with human genes as a model for Alzheimer's. But this success has so far never been replicated in humans.
