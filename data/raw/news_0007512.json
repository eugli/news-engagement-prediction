The petition painted a situation where most contracts awarded in the agency are in violation of the Public Procurement Act. \nThe petitioner accused the management of CRBDA of penalising it for its whistle-blowing activities by deliberately starving it of necessary funds to execute contracts awarded it, a move allegedly calculated to frustrate it. Coasterners also accused CRBDA of withholding funds due to it for projects executed. \nThe Water Resources Ministry has however faulted allegations made against CRBDA, accusing Coasterners of among others, acting with the intention of blackmailing its agencies. The ministry’s position is contained in a letter marked: FMWR/LU/S/292/1/34, titled: “Harassment of the CRBDA by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Coasterners Group Ltd.” \nPart of the letter authored by the ministry’s Director, Legal Services, Gboyega Oyekanmi reads: “The ministry’s attention has been drawn to your frantic efforts to malign the name and integrity of the management and staff of the CRBDA by making spurious and unfounded allegations against them as evidence in the correspondences under reference.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:02:26.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
