(Meaghan Ketcheson/CBC)\nA 22-year-old man was arrested not far from the scene, at a bend on the frozen Red River that runs adjacent to the campus. Charges have not yet been laid against the man, who is known to police.\nCallahan has spoken to Fraser's wife, who is distraught and still recovering from the recent death of a daughter. She and Fraser were raising their granddaughter together.\nA GoFundMe page has been set up by Fraser's colleagues to help his widow and family.\nWinnipeg Transit drivers raising funds after colleague killed in on-the-job attack Callahan, who said he doesn't want Fraser to have died in vain, hopes the incident leads to changes to make the job safer for drivers.\nThat starts with examining where some of the routes end, he said. Maybe they all need to wind up downtown, in a more central location where there is better security and an on-street inspector, Callahan said. That allows an extra person to be there to help wake a sleeper.\nThe U of M campus is far from downtown, dark and quiet at the hour Fraser pulled in at the end of his shift.\nWinnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman said in a news conference Tuesday that he would reach out to Callahan to talk about safety improvements.\nCallahan said he is looking forward to that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:38:32.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
