Students, parents and community members began sharing the video online, furious about its content.\nNews of the incident spread locally and nationally, resulting in hundreds of calls and emails to the school, district and its governing board, some against the skit and some in support, according to the letters.\nMORE: Officials at Boulder Creek High School under fire for Trump skit video\nThe district was initially unaware that Sheahan and Kopas created, performed and recorded the skit, which was \"meant to be light-hearted and entertaining and not disparaging,\" and placed them on paid administrative leave shortly after, according to a statement.\nThe skit violated numerous district policies, according to the suspension letters written by Dan Courson, DVUSDâ€™s director of administrative leadership and services. Both violated:\nStaff ethics policy dictating that employees \"maintain standards of exemplary conduct\" including \"refrains from using school contacts and privileges to promote partisan politics.\" Staff conduct policy that no employee shall \"engage in the use of profane or abusive language, symbols, or conduct.\" Computer guidelines on using district technology to keep or transmit inappropriate video. Sheahan and Kopas have both been directed to \"rebuild relationships with BCHS parents, students, staff and community\" through talking and meeting with student groups, staff, parents and the community.", "external_links": ["http://download.gannett.edgesuite.net/arizonarepublic/brightcove/29901534001/201702/2875/29901534001_5319061847001_5319061990001-vs.jpg", "http://download.gannett.edgesuite.net/arizonarepublic/brightcove/29901534001/201702/2875/29901534001_5319061847001_5319061990001-vs.jpg?pubId=29901534001", "http://bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/azc-mobile/201702/2875/29901534001_5319068403001_5319061990001.mp4", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/52917f55e06237fd9dd93f058d46ed87e0a4b1bc/r=540/http/download.gannett.edgesuite.net/arizonarepublic/brightcove/29901534001/201702/2875/29901534001_5319061847001_5319061990001-vs.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//azc.cc/2kY2rWB&text=2%20officials%20suspended%20without%20pay%20for%20Donald%20Trump%20skit%20video%20at%20Boulder%20Creek%20High%20School%20in%20Anthem&via=azcentral", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//azc.cc/2kY2rWB&mini=true", "http://azc.cc/2kuWWv3", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/sprites/icon_close.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f6971d504a6d894cb7944de3d383c26c5c6bb869/c=0-0-533-401&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2017/01/25/Phoenix/Phoenix/636209430415738948-boulder-creek.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/25/Phoenix/Phoenix/636209430415738948-boulder-creek.jpg", "http://download.gannett.edgesuite.net/arizonarepublic/brightcove/29901534001/201702/2875/29901534001_5319065268001_5319061990001-th.jpg?pubId=29901534001", "http://download.gannett.edgesuite.net/arizonarepublic/brightcove/29901534001/201702/2875/29901534001_5319065268001_5319061990001-th.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2017/01/25/Phoenix/Phoenix/636209430415738948-boulder-creek.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-11T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:27:23.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
