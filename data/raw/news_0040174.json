As consuming animal products and animal meat may double their chance of developing Type-2 diabetes, warns a study. \nThe findings showed that those participants who consumed higher amounts of saturated fatty acids and animal fat had a two fold higher risk of developing Type-2 diabetes than those participants with a lower intake of saturated and animal fat.This study appeared in the scientific journal The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. \nResearchers Universitat Rovira i Virgili in Spain's Tarragona evaluated the associations between total and subtypes of fat intake and the risk of Type-2 diabetes.They analysed data from 3,349 participants, who were free of diabetes at baseline but at high cardiovascular risk.In addition, they have evaluated the relationship between food sources rich in saturated fatty acids and the incidence of type 2 diabetes.After 4.5 years of follow-up, 266 participants developed diabetes. \nThe results indicated that consumption of 12 grams per day of butter was associated with a two fold higher risk of diabetes after 4.5 years of follow-up, whereas the intake of whole-fat yogurt was associated with a lower risk.These findings emphasize the healthy benefits of a Mediterranean diet for preventing chronic diseases, particularly Type-2 diabetes, and the importance of substituting saturated and animal fats, especially red and processed meat for those found in vegetable sources such as olive oil and nuts. \nThe experts suggested the importance of swapping saturated animal fats for olive oil and nuts.
