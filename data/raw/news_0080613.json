Printed with the words \"Strong Like Mom,\" the shirt sends the exact message kids need to hear -- particularly right now, when women's rights are under attack and the issue of gender identity is becoming increasingly controversial (yet again). \nSave \nSave \nSure, to any evolved human being this shirt seems like a no-brainer -- why wouldn't a kid (of either gender) inherit strength from his or her mom? But when you think about all the onesies out there that say things like \" Tuff Guy (Like My Daddy) \" or \" Beautiful Like My Mommy ,\" it becomes painfully obvious that the majority of products marketed to children are the product of ridiculously backwards thinking. So a shirt like this one is actually very meaningful ... more than that, it's powerful. \nAnd it's clearly striking a chord with parents all over -- just check out the #StrongLikeMom hashtag on Instagram. \n\"Today, for the first time in 3 years, I found a shirt for my son that says 'strong like Mom' rather than 'strong like Dad,'\" writes Instagram user and mom, Leah Abbleby-Michael . \"Thank you Target for realizing that little boys can want to be strong like their moms as well as like their dads.\" \nYes, thank you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:17:27.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
