She said she was honored to be given the opportunity—although she didn’t explicitly endorse Trump himself—and that she and her family tried to ignore the hatred. Now, with the rules allowing transgender students to use the bathroom that matches with their gender identity removed, it’s personal: Evancho’s sister, Juliet, is transgender and would be directly affected by the ruling. Juliet Evancho has even sued her public school district to allow her to use the bathroom that matches her identity. \nAccording to Juliet, who wrote about her experience as a transgender woman for Teen Vogue last year , her sister had been nothing but supportive of her. \n“[Jackie] too was not at all surprised and was very supportive and happy that I found my true self, but at the same time she was terrified about the potential ridicule I’d face for the rest of my life,” Juliet wrote. \nEvancho expressed her disappointment about the ruling and tried to appeal to the president and attempted to get a meeting with him to discuss transgender rights by using his platform of choice: Twitter. I am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide. #sisterlove — jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 22, 2017 . @realDonaldTrump u gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration. Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #transgender rghts ❤ — jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 23, 2017 Trump has yet to respond to Evancho.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:22:33.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
