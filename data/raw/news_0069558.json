Those are very specific attributes and each attribute is ranked on a scale of zero to five and then your application is graded on the sum of the attributes.\n\"It's not based on the answers to the questions themselves, but the attributes you display. Some of them are leadership, responsibility for others, … each of them are linked to the five short-answer questions you answer to get in.\"\nCanadian law school students band together to help refugees banned by Trump Investigation started in 2013 Hauen says The Ubyssey investigation started in 2013 with a Freedom of Information request, which was unsuccessful.\nThe Ubyssey appealed to the B.C. Office of Information and Privacy Commissioner to compel UBC to release the rubric, but UBC still would not.\nCanadian professors join academic boycott of U.S. in protest of Trump travel ban Then the B.C. Supreme Court ruled UBC had to release the documents since it could not prove doing so would cause UBC or its application process undue harm — a decision the school appealed.\n\"It certainly seems they would have pursued this until the end of time,\" Hauen said.\nThe four-year investigation only ended when an anonymous source gave the student paper what appears to be the grading rubric.\nUBC told CBC News it would not confirm whether or not the rubric, purportedly used in 2016, was authentic.\nIn a response to On The Coast , UBC director of undergraduate admissions Andrew Arida wrote \"releasing the [broad-based admission] application scoring guides would allow prospective students to tailor their answers and compromise the authenticity of the response to meet UBC's requirements.\"\nBut Hauen disagrees and says sharing the rubric is important to give all applicants a fair shot at the process.\nWith files from CBC Radio One's On The Coast", "external_links": ["https://www.oipc.bc.ca/orders/1915", "https://www.alumni.ubc.ca/volunteer-and-donate/broad-based-admissions-alumni-reader/"], "published": "2017-02-21T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:51:49.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
