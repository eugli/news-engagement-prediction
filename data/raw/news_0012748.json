Muslim-majority countries, 100 leading companies and figures from the Obama administration, including John Kerry, led efforts to bring the ban down.\nFurious Trump says judge who defied him has put US 'in peril' Read more \nThe ninth circuit court of appeals in San Francisco set the 6pm ET (3pm PT) deadline for the new briefs, having on Saturday rejected a government application for an emergency stay of the ruling by Seattle judge James Robart that suspended the order on Friday .\nAs both travel from the countries involved and refugee admissions continued unhindered, feelings on each side of the issue were running high, after Trump spent the weekend attacking Robart .\nOn Sunday afternoon, the president used Twitter to say “blame” would lie with Robart and the courts “if something happens”, apparently implying a terrorist attack. \nIn briefs filed early on Monday, lawyers for Washington state and Minnesota told the appeals court it would “unleash chaos again” if it lifted the Trump order. The briefs said Trump’s travel ban harmed residents, businesses and universities and was unconstitutional.\nIn the immediate aftermath of Trump’s signing of the order, 10 days ago, airports saw large protests as travellers with valid visas were stopped from entering the country. \nWhite House sources including the president have insisted only 109 people were affected and said most were merely delayed. Government figures for the number of visas revoked worldwide before the ban was suspended ranged from 60,000 to 100,000 .\nTech giants Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Intel, eBay, Netflix and Uber were among the signatories to the companies’ brief, filed on Sunday , as were Levi Strauss and Chobani. Amazon, which supported efforts which led to the Seattle ruling, did not sign. Nor did Tesla and SpaceX.\n“The order represents a significant departure from the principles of fairness and predictability that have governed the immigration system of the United States for more than 50 years,” the brief stated. \n“The order inflicts significant harm on American business, innovation, and growth as a result. Immigrants or their children founded more than 200 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list.” \nFormer Obama secretary of state John Kerry and Bill Clinton secretary of state Madeleine Albright joined other former top US national security officials in asking the courts to continue blocking Trump’s order.\nMost of the former officials served under Obama. They said travel restrictions on seven Muslim-majority countries would disrupt “thousands” of lives, while “endangering US troops in the field” and hurting partnerships with other countries to combat terrorism.\nThe group wrote in a six-page document that the order would aid Islamic State’s “propaganda effort and serve its recruitment message by feeding into the narrative that the United States is at war with Islam”.\nThey said: “Blanket bans of certain countries or classes of people are beneath the dignity of the nation and constitution that we each took oaths to protect.”\nThe White House has said it expects the ban to be restored, arguing that it is a legitimate expression of the president’s authority on matters of national security.\nOn Sunday, vice-president Mike Pence told CBS: “We remain very confident that the president’s actions are on solid constitutional and legal grounds.” \nNo major terror attack has ever been mounted on the mainland US by citizens of the seven countries named under the order: Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya. Arrests have been made of individuals who attempted to aid terror groups abroad . \nA man who stabbed 10 people at a Minnesota mall in September before being killed by an off-duty police officer was Somali in origin, born in Kenya. That attack has not been officially called an act of terrorism, though FBI director James Comey cited “some sort of inspiration from radical Islamic groups”.\nThe man who attempted an attack in Paris on Friday – prompting Trump to tweet : “A new radical Islamic terrorist has just attacked in Louvre Museum in Paris. Tourists were locked down. France on edge again. GET SMART US” – was from Egypt. \nThe man who is charged with shooting dead six people at a Quebec mosque on last month – an attack about which Trump has not commented – was a white Canadian who acquaintances said supported Trump’s agenda.\nOn Sunday, Pence also dismissed suggestions that Trump’s attacks on Judge Robart were inappropriate and potentially dangerous.\n“The president has every right to criticize the other two branches of government,” Pence told NBC. “I think people find it very refreshing that they not only understand this president’s mind, but they understand how he feels.”\nTrump, who spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort, was due to address a military audience in Florida on Monday afternoon. In a pair of early morning tweets , he claimed broad national support for his executive order.\n“Any negative polls are fake news,” the president wrote, “just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.\n“I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:49:00.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
