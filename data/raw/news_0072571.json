The 89th Annual Oscars, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, have received a metered market rating of 21.4/37, pointedly down from last year's numbers, which were the lowest in eight years. The event on Sunday was marred by opposition from Trump supporters and a mix-up in announcing the winner for Best Picture, which was first given to the wrong film for the first time in history. Scroll down for video The 89th Annual Oscars, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, have received a metered market rating of 21.4/37, pointedly down from last year's numbers, which were the lowest in eight years In what is being called the most dramatic moment in Academy Award history, the Oscar for Best Picture was accidentally first given to La La Land, then awarded to Moonlight after the mistake was noticed and the crowd went wild WHAT'S IN A RATING? The first number, 21.4, refers to the rating - a figure of the viewers tuned into the award ceremony compared to people in the United States who own a television. Therefore 21.4% of people who own a television were watching the Oscars. The second number, 37, is the share, which is a faction of how many people watched the Oscars as opposed to any other television screening at the same time. Slightly higher than the rating, it infers that 37% of people watching television while the Oscars were on were in fact watching the Oscars. The rating from the Neilson Company is a ratio inferred from viewer data that the company monitors. TVLine reported that the official number of viewers would be released soon. The awards went a few minutes past midnight on the East Coast and ended in controversy when presenters Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty mistakenly announced \"La La Land\" as the best picture winner after getting the wrong envelope. The actual winner, \"Moonlight,\" was eventually announced. The awards ceremony was laden with political commentary, with many winners voicing their opinion at recent implications from the Trump administration. Comments ranged from humorous to grave, with host Jimmy Kimmel throwing a few jabs at the President, while Iranian director Asghar Farhadi had previously said he was not attending the Oscars in revolt against Trump's immigration ban. Kimmel made no attempt to veil his jokes towards the president, who recently announced he would not attend the White House Correspondents' Dinner, which typically consists of a lighthearted roast of the president from the media and comedians. He began his speech by saying: 'This broadcast is being watched by millions of Americans and around the world by more than 225 countries that now hate us and I think that is an amazing thing. As you know, I don't have to tell anybody, the country is divided right now. 'Some of you will get to come up on this stage tonight and give a speech that the President of the United States will tweet about in all caps during his 5am bowel movement tomorrow. And I think that’s pretty darn excellent if you ask me, so let’s get going.' Kimmel made no attempt to veil his jokes towards the president, beginning his speech with some cheeky jabs Iranian director Asghar Farhadi had previously said he was not attending the Oscars in revolt against Trump's immigration ban Farhadi's statement was read when he received the Academy Award for best foreign film for his drama, The Salesman. It said: 'I'm sorry I'm not with you tonight. My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and the other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S.' Trump supporters had recently launched a campaign to boycott the Oscars, to express their protest of the 'limousine liberals' who don't represent them. An anti-Oscar protest was held in Los Angeles yesterday that ended with a brawl between two women. The boycott originated in a widely shared Facebook pos t from Arizona women's group 'Tempe Republican Women,' which urged followers to vote with their remote controls and switch off the Oscars. 'It is important that we, the deplorables, show the likes of Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Alec Baldwin, Cher ... that we, the backbone and decent people of America, are more united than the bitter, unhappy, angry, divisive people of the entertainment industry,' the post said. The angry Facebook post went on to call Hollywood liberals 'arrogant, pompous, pampered soulless individuals' who are 'evil-hearted.'
