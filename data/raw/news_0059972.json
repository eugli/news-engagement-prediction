That's why the prices have been raised,\" he said after a programme in Sylhet on Friday on being asked about the price hike. \nBangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) announced the new prices with over 50 percent rise for household use on Thursday. \nThe Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) and Bangladesher Samajtantrik Dal (BaSoD) have called a half-day general strike for Feb 28 in protest against the decision. \nThe Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB) has termed the gas price hike 'irrational' and is considering moving the High Court. \nThe price of compressed natural gas (CNG), used for automobiles, will go up from Tk 35 to 38 per cubic metre in March and Tk 40 in June. \nThe 14.28 percent hike will drive the public transport fare up. \nFor fertiliser production, industries and commercial entities, gas prices are rising by as low as 5 percent to as high as 50 percent. \nTop trade body FBCCI says it will put the exports in a new challenge while garment entrepreneurs' BGMEA is worried about meeting the export target. \nArguing for the price hike, State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid Bipu has said the rise was not 'too big'. \nHe also said power prices would go up too. For power generation, the price of gas is increasing by 12 to 15 percent. \nSpeaking to reporters after the programme in Sylhet, Finance Minister Muhith also reacted to the BNP's claim that the Awami League plotted the Canadian Federal Court verdict describing the BNP as a terrorist one. \n\"The BNP always sees foul play in its failures,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T11:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:31:41.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
