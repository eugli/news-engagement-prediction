They also featured Colombian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar and Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.\nHernando Co. sheriffs office makes what may be County's largest heroin bust ever. Seized 5500 packets some with Pres. Trump's face on them. pic.twitter.com/SH9k1aWWYs\n— Rod Carter (@WFLARod) February 3, 2017\nAlthough it’s unclear why the drugs featured Trump’s face, the branding comes with a touch of irony. Trump, as a candidate and as president, repeatedly touted himself as tough on crime and vowed to crack down on the flow of drugs being trafficked into the United States, especially through a hardline immigration policy. Sheriff Al Nienhuis, however, told the Tampa Bay Times the drugs came from the northeastern United States.\nFlorida’s Attorney General Pam Bondi wasn’t amused. “All I want to say to this drug dealer is, ‘Big mistake by putting the president’s picture on this,” Bondi said. “Big mistake. Because he is going to be our most fierce advocate in taking this junk off of our streets. Can you believe this? Big mistake.”\nPolice arrested Kelvin Scott Johnson, 46, in connection with the heroin bust. He is being held on a $75,000 bail on suspicion of heroin trafficking, among other charges, WCTV-TV reported . Johnson had been on authorities’ radar since May 2016, when the U.S. Postal Service reportedly intercepted a parcel containing 550 packages of heroin.", "external_links": ["http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/largest-heroin-bust-in-hernando-history-comes-with-image-of-donald-trump/2312020", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Ftrumps-face-appeared-on-florida-heroin", "https://twitter.com/WFLARod/status/827564102964895744", "http://www.wctv.tv/content/news/Envelopes-with-famous-faces-leads-to-heroin-bust-in-Hernando-County-412784243.html", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Donald", "https://t.co/SH9k1aWWYs"], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:05:58.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
