The UFC president said that it's not only due to the fact that she's coming off of back-to-back losses to Holly Holm and Amanda Nunes, but because she also made a lifetime's worth of money within a couple of years and she intends on exploring other avenues in life. Related Holly Holm: Ronda Rousey Can Come Back From Knockout Losses \"I'm not going to sit here and say I broke her,\" Holm tells Rolling Stone \nOne of those avenues is acting. As Rousey told ESPN in 2014, she has dreams of being the \" highest-grossing actor in the world someday .\" She followed that up with appearances on Entourage and Furious 7 in 2015, as well as an episode of Comedy Central's Drunk History in 2016. And now, after taking a short break from acting, she's scored a guest role on NBC's Blindspot as a prison inmate, which is scheduled to air sometime in May. \nHere are some details about her role, via Bloody Elbow : \n\"Rousey will be playing Devon Penberthy: a female prison inmate who grew up in a working class family from the White Mountains of New Hampshire, and is serving time for transporting weapons across state lines. She is a tough, athletic woman who knows how to fight and handle a weapon.\" \nRousey has been mostly silent since her last loss. Her public appearances limited to visiting Standing Rock protesters to bring them supplies, not going to train for another fight. This doesn't mean Rousey is absolutely done with fighting, of course, but it's a sign she might be ready to focus her attention on her other dreams. Rousey told Ellen DeGeneres that her fight against Nunes at UFC 207 would “ definitely one of my last fights .” Based on how it went and what people around her are saying, it wouldn't be a surprise if this is the first domino to fall.
