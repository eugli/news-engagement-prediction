Vizio has information about how it uses “Smart Interactivity” and “Video ACR” on its website and how to opt out. It instructs users to press the “Menu” button on their remote or open their HDTV Settings app, navigate to “system,” then select “Reset & Admin.” After highlighting “Smart Interactivity,” they can press the “Right” arrow and change the setting to “Off.” Vizio had to only pay a fine? The company, based on a stipulated order, must delete data collected before March 1, 2016 — before it sent the pop-up on data collection — and “prominently disclose and obtain affirmative express consent for its data collection and sharing practices.” In an email responding to questions from The New York Times, Vizio said that it had a new, prominent opt-in notice sharing information about the collection of its viewing data, and that “only users which ‘accept’ ACR data collection will be enrolled in ACR data collection.” It’s also worth noting that this order is separate from a class-action lawsuit Vizio is fighting in California around the tracking software in its TVs. The company said in its email it planned to “vigorously defend the class-action proceedings, and believe them to be without merit.” Did Vizio make money doing this? In Vizio’s filing to go public, it said it had “yet to generate meaningful revenue from” Inscape, its data arm. It noted, however, that demand from advertisers and media content providers could give it access to “total global market spend on audience and advertisement measurement services” of about $1.9 billion in 2014. Vizio agreed to be acquired by the Chinese video streaming company LeEco last year, but a spokeswoman said Tuesday that it was “pending and has not been completed yet.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story How about other smart TVs? While this complaint is about Vizio, the F.T.C. said in a statement that “we always advise companies to review our settlements for a better understanding of what the F.T.C. Act requires.” This is also the first time that the F.T.C. has alleged in a complaint that individualized TV viewing activity counts as “sensitive information,” a category that includes Social Security numbers, information about children and precise geolocation information. The F.T.C. has recommended that consumers be given the choice to opt into sharing sensitive data. Chris Heinonen, a staff writer at The Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, said Vizio, while it is under fire, was now being more transparent than competitors engaging in the same data collection, as well as streaming services like Netflix. A version of this article appears in print on February 8, 2017, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Vizio Collected Viewer Data Without Consent. What You Should Know.
