He has notched up two assists during that time, though. Article continues below \nHis manager, Arsene Wenger, called on him to start scoring again after their 2-0 victory over Hull but it’s not just his boss that isn’t too impressed with him at the moment. \nThat’s because, according to a report in the Daily Mail , his teammates are also frustrated with him. Article continues below \nThey suggest that Ozil is finding himself under increasing pressure after some of the players feel he gets preferential treatment from Wenger. \nThey believe that he is above criticism and is exempt from rotation or being dropped. \nThey’re also disappointed with his commitment to the cause, with many players highlighting the role he played in allowing Ashley Williams to score a late winner for Everton in December. \nMeanwhile, poor performances against Manchester City and Chelsea also raised eyebrows. \nBut it’s not just his performances on the pitch that are a concern. \nWhile the former Real Madrid star is considered a private person, his teammates aren’t impressed with his attitude after matches. \nUnder previous captains, players were forced to bring their friends and family to the players’ lounge following matches to get to know each other. \nHowever, this isn’t really the case at the Emirates anymore and, according to the Mail, “Ozil has been seen at the door, clicking his fingers or signalling his entourage to shuffle out behind him” without interacting with anyone. \nOf course, this is a worrying report from Arsenal fans when you consider Ozil’s contract expires at the end of next season. His future is far from certain and, if Arsenal fail to finish in the top four, Ozil will surely be tempted to leave this summer. \nWhen things are going well, though, Ozil is a pleasure to watch. Gooners will just be hoping they’re able to see that side of him immediately with a trip to Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
