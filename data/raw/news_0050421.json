(Handout/The Baltimore Sun) (Meredith Cohn) \nThe pay-what-you-can workshops are intended to improve education about the increasingly popular unmanned aerial vehicles and build on Open Works' efforts to make technology and trade skills more accessible to the local community, said Will Holman, general manager of Open Works. \n\"The long-term vision for Open Works, the 10-year horizon, is to create a real pipeline of grassroots economic development,\" Holman said. \nThe organization opened its Greenmount West facility in September. The former warehouse houses woodworking, metal and sewing workshops; other heavy-duty equipment is available through a membership. (Sarah Gantz) \nHolman said the organization is striving to establish a stronger connection to the community with classes that are open to the public and a mobile workshop that teaches hands-on lessons at schools. \n\"We're looking at this as a very broad spectrum mission here that goes beyond just the gee-whiz technology that we have in some of these shops and gets into the meaningful connections with our neighbors,\" Holman said. \nAs part of the partnership, Global Air Media will establish its headquarters at Open Works. \nThe company was founded in 2015 and does cinematography and mapping with drones. It also works with schools to offer after-school programs and tutorials about drones. \nMcDonogh School in Owings Mills worked with Global Air Media last fall to offer an after-school program that taught students how to build drones from a kit. The program also covered safety and proper use of drones â€” lessons Olivia Grant, the head of McDonogh's after-school programs, said are important for students as recreational drones become more common. \n\"Even though they were having fun, it was educational,\" Grant said. \"It was fun with a purpose.\" \nCommercial and recreational drone use is on the rise as the price of drone technology falls and new regulations outline their legal uses. The global market for commercial applications of drones could grow to nearly $127 billion in the near future, according to a PriceWaterhouseCoopers report last year. \nIn September, ESPN announced a deal to air a 10-episode series with the Drone Racing League, a U.S.-based professional league that's run races in such venues as an old power station and an abandoned mall. \nThe Baltimore Drone Racing League will hold its first race April 1 on an enclosed course at Open Works. \nWhile the inaugural race will feature premade drones, a key tenet of the league in the future will be for youths to build their own drones for racing. \nUmoh compared his vision for the drone racing league to other sports leagues, where local teams compete against each other and occasionally travel to race against other leagues. \nEach team would have a pilot, who flies the drone by using a pair of goggles connected to a camera on the drone. A navigator is responsible for checking weather and track conditions that could affect flight. Other team members are on hand to rush out to repair damage when a drone crashes or to prepare it for the next heat. \nThe league will be open to youths age 13 and older, as well as to adults, Umoh said. Global Air Media is working out some details still, he said, such as fees for participating and options for reducing the cost for lower-income participants. \ntwitter.com/sarahgantz ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:57:10.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
