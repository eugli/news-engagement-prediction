Although it felt a bit like early April for a few hours, we are all about to be hit with a heavy dose of reality.\nNor’easters are called nor’easters because as the storm approaches, the winds blow from the northeast. These winds are going to be strong enough along the coast to create blizzard conditions. A blizzard has nothing to do with the amount of snow, but rather serves more as a visibility and wind advisory. It means you won’t be able to see more than a quarter mile or less for three hours in a row because the winds will be blowing the snow so much. The most likely places to see a true blizzard tomorrow will be along the coast, south of Boston.\nDave Epstein, NOAA Data\nBlizzard warnings are posted for the coast south of Boston, Winter Storm Warnings elsewhere.\nAdvertisement\nThe rest of us can expect a classic snowstorm. The storm will have powdery wind-whipped snow along with cold air, and the snow will quickly pile up to around a foot or more. In these situations, heavy snow bands can develop and leave two to three inches of snow in one hour over a narrow distance. Though these bands are tough to forecast, they are the reason I have added the possibility of some towns receiving more than 14 inches.\nDave Epstein\nMost areas will be within an inch or two of a foot of snow when the storm ends Thursday evening.\nIf you need to head to work Thursday, leave as early as possible. Between 9 and 10 a.m. I expect the intensity of the snow to increase, with the core of the storm arriving by about 11 a.m. and continuing through about 4 or 5 p.m. Remember, the storm is moving west to east, so those west of Route 495 should expect the storm to arrive - and end - a bit earlier.\nTropical Tidbits\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Although tides are quite high tomorrow, any coastal flooding will be light. There aren’t even any coastal flood warnings posted in spite of the strong ocean storm. This is due to the fast movement of the nor’easter and the fact it will be low tide, not high, during the height of the storm.\nView Story Lately, February means lots of snow Snow piling up in February has become as routine as Tom Brady hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at this time of year.\nIt appears right now as if the snow will completely end between 7 p.m and 10 p.m. west to east. However, I will refine that time window Thursday once the storm is underway, as these large storms can still bring some surprises.\nThe snow will clear out Thursday night, leaving a sunny, bright, blustery and cold day Friday. Another weather system may bring some more light snow Friday night or Saturday, but that’s not going to be a big storm - just enough to keep us on our toes and remind us winter isn’t close to over.\nYou can follow Dave Epstein’s forecast on Twitter @growingwisdom.", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Here’s", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F08%2Fhere-how-tomorrow-storm-will-develop%2Ft337XxFNZ17yQOg43dVJqK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Here’s", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F08%2Fhere-how-tomorrow-storm-will-develop%2Ft337XxFNZ17yQOg43dVJqK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://twitter.com/growingwisdom", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F08%2Fhere-how-tomorrow-storm-will-develop%2Ft337XxFNZ17yQOg43dVJqK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tHere’s", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F08%2Fhere-how-tomorrow-storm-will-develop%2Ft337XxFNZ17yQOg43dVJqK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Here’s"], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:29:30.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
