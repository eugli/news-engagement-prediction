However, the present market value of the properties is more than Rs 100 crore. \n“Sinh and Manoranjana Sinh are facing trial in the money laundering case before the special court under PMLA at Kolkata,” the agency said. \nThis is the fifth attachment order issued by the agency in the case where gullible investors from West Bengal and Assam were allegedly cheated of their hard-earned money worth crores. \nWith the latest action, ED has so far attached properties worth Rs 700 crore in this case. \nAn attachment under PMLA is aimed to deprive the accused from obtaining benefits of their ill-gotten wealth and such an order can be appealed before the Adjudicating Authority of the said Act within 180 days. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:36:51.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
