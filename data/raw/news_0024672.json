That is expected to take about six to eight weeks. \nThat needs to happen before any work can begin on the ground. \nThe Circuit of Wales was at one time claimed to eventually result in 6,000 jobs in the unemployment blackspot of Blaenau Gwent by building a track with hotels and business units. \nIt has the rights to MotoGP until 2024. Image copyright Extreme \nIn response to a question from Neil Hamilton AM, Mr Skates said the \"deal on the table was certainly better than the one that was presented back in July\". \nHe added: \"It justified the position taken back then when we were presented with guarantees amounting to 83% - which is £100m more in guarantees than what we've been able to drive through with this deal. \n\"However, due diligence is required, as normal, as in every project of this type, to give us confidence that the investment, the potential guarantee draw-down is something the tax payer is comfortable with, something that we are comfortable with, and no investor should fear the due diligence process\". \nIn the last year the project has attracted two new important partners. \nIn October 2016, the private bank Kleinwort Benson joined Circuit of Wales as its corporate advisor. \nThe developers then recently teamed up with the Extreme company - which has an online sports channel - with the proposals now including mountain bike trails, a BMX park, stages for live concerts and indoor skiing, a skate park and virtual reality zone. \nThat development reduced the risk of the project as it would be expected to attract a range of adventure sports and visitors all year round. \nThe partners claim the development could attract 750,000 visitors a year and inject an estimated £50m into the Welsh economy annually. \nThe project has hinged on financial guarantees from the Welsh Government. \nLast April, the then Economy Secretary Edwina Hart said there was an \"unacceptable risk\" in guaranteeing it all, 100% . But the company was asked to come back with alternatives. \nIt was then suggested that after the circuit is built, the Welsh Government would underwrite half the cost the project - and be paid more than £125m over 33 years. \nMrs Hart's successor Ken Skates, keen for \"faster progress\", finally gave the developers a two-week deadline to produce details of its financial backers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T16:47:47.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
