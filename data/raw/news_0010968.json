In addition to the call with Mr. Poroshenko, he spoke to Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy, Prime Minister Bill English of New Zealand, and the secretary-general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg — a conversation that could not have been relaxing, given Mr. Trump’s earlier assertions that the alliance is a Cold War relic. In its two-sentence summary of the Ukraine call, the White House described the exchange with Mr. Poroshenko as “very good” and quoted Mr. Trump as saying, “we will work with Ukraine, Russia, and other parties to help them restore peace along the border” — a statement that did not take account of the fact that Russia unlawfully annexed Crimea. Mr. Trump brought along his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, which suggested that he was briefed regularly on the legal battle over his immigration order. Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon both stayed at Mar-a-Lago, which has guest rooms. Photo Guests arriving on Saturday at the Red Cross ball at Mar-a-Lago, with its Hapsburg and Bourbon motif. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Even when Mr. Trump was off the clock, he appeared preoccupied by the world outside. On Saturday morning, he began a Twitter tirade against the Seattle judge who had blocked the immigration order. Though he went quiet during the four and a half hours he was at the Trump International Golf Club — the White House declined to confirm that he actually played golf or say who his partners were — the Twitter posts resumed when he got back to the house. Even as his guests were mingling during cocktails, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, “The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interest at heart. Bad people are very happy!” When Mr. Trump bought Mar-a-Lago at a fire-sale price in 1985, he was viewed by many in this uppity enclave as a parvenu who would cheapen the legacy of the estate. Those days are gone — especially now that he has the power to make his friends ambassadors to European capitals. \n  But Mr. Trump still draws his share of catcalls — some subtle, others not. Across the street from his golf club, the Palm Beach County library had a sign in the front door advertising an evening with Amy Sherman, a reporter from The Miami Herald and PolitiFact Florida, to discuss how to expose disingenuous political figures. “Pants on Fire: How to Fact-Check Politicians,” it said. On Saturday, about 3,000 demonstrators marched along Flagler Drive, carrying signs and chanting, “Hey-hey, ho-ho, Donald Trump has got to go.” About 300 managed to walk across the bridge to Palm Beach, according to The Palm Beach Post, where they got within 25 yards of Mar-a-Lago before encountering an armored security vehicle. At 8 p.m., when the fireworks exploded above the estate, they cast a glow on the crowd, witnesses said, giving them a better view of the show than the one enjoyed by the guests inside Mr. Trump’s winter White House.
