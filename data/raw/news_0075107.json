What follows is a preview of the five matches already confirmed for WWE Fastlane 2017 , along with predictions for those matches and the matches rumored to be added to the card before Sunday’s event. Roman Reigns faces Braun Strowman at Fastlane 2017. Will he also face The Undertaker at WrestleMania 33? [Image by WWE] Neville (c) vs. Jack Gallagher — WWE Cruiserweight Championship Match \nBoth the WWE Cruiserweight Champion Neville and the No. 1 contender Jack Gallagher have roots in the United Kingdom, but the similarities end there. Neville has completely dominated 205 Live and Raw’s Cruiserweight Division since going through a heel turn. Jack Gallagher’s gentlemanly gimmick — complete with umbrella-sidekick William the Third — has gone over very well with the WWE Universe, often using moves that remind fans of Mary Poppins. The Cruiserweight Division is already on its fourth champion since the title was awarded to T.J. Perkins in September, and Neville is being booked as the strongest champion to date. \nPrediction: Neville retains the Cruiserweight Championship and faces a new challenger (Austin Aries) at WrestleMania 33 . Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson (c) vs. Enzo Amore & Big Cass — Raw Tag Team Championship Match \nThe popularity of Enzo and Big Cass has wavered a little since their main roster debut shortly after WrestleMania 32 , but they have risen to the top of the Raw Tag Team Division in recent weeks, punctuated with a victory over Cesaro and Sheamus to earn a title shot at Fastlane . Gallows and Anderson won the titles from Cesaro and Sheamus in rather controversial fashion, despite the fact that the match had two referees. \nPrediction: Gallows and Anderson retain under questionable circumstances, leading to a Triple Threat Tag Team Match at WrestleMania 33 with Cesaro and Sheamus thrown back into the mix. Bayley (c) vs. Charlotte Flair — Raw Women’s Championship Match \nNo WWE title has changed hands more frequently over the last year than what is now recognized as the Raw Women’s Championship. One year ago, it was still known as the Divas Championship, and Charlotte was in the midst of a reign that would run through WrestleMania 32 , when the title was rebranded as the WWE Women’s Championship. Shortly after SummerSlam 2016 and the creation of the SmackDown Women’s Championship, the title was rebranded once again as the Raw Women’s Championship. By that time, Charlotte had already dropped the title to Sasha Banks and won it back — which would be a recurring theme. Charlotte is now a four-time former champion, while Bayley will have held the title for less than three weeks when she faces Flair at WWE Fastlane 2017 . \nPrediction: Charlotte Flair defeats Bayley at Fastlane , and a Fatal 4-Way is scheduled for WrestleMania 33 that also includes Sasha Banks and Nia Jax. Bayley defends the Raw Women’s Championship against Charlotte Flair, who is virtually unstoppable when it comes to PPV title matches. [Image by WWE] Roman Reigns vs. Braun Strowman \nThe only non-title match that had been confirmed prior to the February 27 episode of Monday Night Raw was Roman Reigns vs. Braun Strowman. As WWE continues to build Strowman’s character as an unstoppable monster, they’ve decided to book him in a short program against Roman Reigns, the man who the WWE Universe refuses to embrace the way Vince would like. With all signs pointing towards Roman Reigns vs. The Undertaker at WrestleMania 33 , it seems likely that The Dead Man will show up at Fastlane 2017 . The only question will be whether he shows up to cost Reigns his match against Strowman, or whether he shows up after Roman defeats Braun to officially challenge The Big Dog to an epic battle at WrestleMania . \nPrediction: The Undertaker distracts Roman Reigns, setting up their match at WrestleMania 33 while Braun Strowman gets the win at Fastlane . \nRELATED REPORTS BY THE INQUISITR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:32:40.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
