Just as David Bowie cleaned up at the Grammys , he was one of the night’s biggest winners at the 2017 Brit Awards, where he won Album of the Year for Blackstar . His son Duncan Jones was there to accept the award on his father’s behalf, giving a sweet speech about becoming a father in the same year that he lost his own and how he’d want his son to remember his late grandfather just as Bowie’s fans did. “He’s always been there supporting people who think they’re a little bit weird or a little bit strange, a little bit different, he’s always been there for them,” he said . “So this award is for all the kooks and all the people who make the kooks.” Earlier in the night, Bowie also won Best British Male Solo Artist; Michael C. Hall, who stars in Bowie’s Lazarus musical, accepted that award on Bowie’s behalf. Hall had a laugh at the irony of Bowie’s posthumous acclaim in his speech: “If David Bowie could be here tonight, he probably wouldn’t be here tonight.”\nSpeech of the night goes to #MichaelCHall accepting #BritishMaleSoloArtist on behalf of the #legend @DavidBowieReal #Brits pic.twitter.com/sCBWrLr7u5 \n— Andy Cook (@AndyCook1975) February 22, 2017 Tags: top story david bowie brits 2017 music David Bowie Wins Album of the Year at the 2017 Brit Awards   Video Games Are Better Than Real Life What to Stream Now See what's new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBO Bill Maher Thinks His Real Time Interview Brought Down Milo Yiannopoulos Brian Tyree Henry on This Is Us , That Heartbreaking Episode, and Working With His BFF Sterling K.
