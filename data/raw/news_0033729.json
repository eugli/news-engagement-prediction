I’m sure that a deal will be done, and the UK could could pay its whack and get access, but it’s just another part of Brexit that no one’s actually thought about.\n“There are targets for growing the UK space industry and it’s just woefully negligent that they haven’t thought about this in the past year.”\nThe Government is making much of its commitment to space technology, with plans for a UK spaceport potentially within three years.\nThe head of the European Space Agency’s EU policy office, Jean Bruston, has previously warned that the UK would have to renegotiate terms to continue participating in Galileo and other space projects.\nNorway and Switzerland are members of the ESA but had to broker their own agreements to join Galileo in 2009 and 2014 respectively.\nBritain is also party to other EU-led space programmes such as the Copernicus satellite system, which monitors environmental damage.\nRead more Brexit will cost lives if UK quits EU drug regulator, warns expert European Commission 'agrees £48bn Brexit divorce bill' Anger as leak shows steel industry is ‘low priority’ in Brexit talks Independent Scotland would have to join queue for EU membership “As soon as [Britain] is leaving the EU it is not participating in these programmes any longer,” Mr Bruston said.\nUK companies hold contracts worth tens of millions to provide hardware to the project.\n“If nothing changes [and Brexit goes ahead], we would have to stop these contracts,” Mr Bruston warned.\nThe project has suffered several technological setbacks, notably an incident late last year when clocks on nine of the satellites stopped working. But the system could prove superior to the American GPS system currently deployed by Britain. For security reasons that system provides more accurate location data to the US military than commercial users receive. Galileo may eventually offer the same degree of accuracy to cars and phones as the US gives to its warplanes and submarines.\nSources at the Department for International Trade advised that any negotiations on Galileo could only begin after Article 50 has been triggered. In the meantime, the possibility of the UK ending up with poorer quality satellite navigation than their continental neighbours, despite having helped build it, is real.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:35:36.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
