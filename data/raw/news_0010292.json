The word 'inspiration' is used too often when speaking about sports, but watching women go around in AFL kits in front of thousands of fans has been fairly labelled just that by those at both ends of the spectrum. \nThe opening week of the AFLW competition was a tremendous success in terms of crowds, viewers, competitiveness, skills and most importantly, good will. With the first round down, it's a good time to reflect on what we've learnt. \nFirst the numbers: Friday night's game between the traditional rivals Carlton and Collingwood drew a crowd of over 25,000 people who packed into Carlton's old suburban home of Princes Park, with over a thousand stranded outside the gates. \nThat was followed by two crowds of around 10,000 to see Adelaide beat GWS at Thebarton Oval and at the Whitten Oval in Footscray to see the Bulldogs beat Fremantle. \nDespite horrendous conditions — heavy rain and lightning strikes at Melbourne's Casey Fields on Sunday — 6,500 people turned out to see Brisbane beat Melbourne. \nThe crowd numbers were augmented by exceptional TV figures. More than 1 million people watched Friday night's game, while the two Saturday matches drew a combined total of almost 900,000 viewers.

We saw a great mix in the crowd of families, young women and girls and men clearly enjoying getting up-close to the football at the traditional suburban grounds. It was like a throwback to the old days of the VFL and people loved it. \nAnd the football. In a word: tough. The players were unbelievably ferocious. The attack on the football was uncompromising. The upshot was four very physical games. \nWhile the commitment level of the players could not be faulted, the skills did fluctuate.

(AAP: Joe Castro) \nDaisy Pearce is already a household name in the football world, but she will soon be joined by the likes of Emma Kearney, Brianna Davey and Darcy Vescio, whose kicking, handballing and marking was all first-class. But the top tier was certainly a cut above the rest. \nWhile the skills were generally good, kicks often went astray and marks went down when the pressure was on. That is not unexpected. The same is true — although to a lesser extent — in the men's game. The more these women train and the more seasons the play, those skills will improve. \nAs it was, the skill level across all the games, seemed generally more even than they were one year ago during the Bulldogs-Demons exhibition game. Clearly three months of solid skills and fitness work has had a huge impact on the players. It meant the likes of the one-time Australian basketball champion, Erin Phillips, starred with three goals and fourteen possessions for the Adelaide Crows in their win over GWS. AFLW is uncharted territory, which is exciting and nerve-wracking in equal measure. Get yourself up to speed with the league as it gets underway. \nThe first round is over and was an unmitigated success. The test now will be whether the crowds will remain as high, the TV audience stays above one million and the quality of the football continues to improve. \nWhat is certain is that the AFL has tapped a rich vein with the women's competition. Women's football has met a community expectation and opened up an endless possibility of commercial opportunities. Big numbers, mean big ratings, new sponsors and more money in the game. That will in turn allow the players to get paid more, which means over time they can transition from part-time to fully professional athletes. \nFor now, though, any girls playing Auskick or Aussie Rules have something to aspire to and be inspired by, while other women's sports in Australia are contemplating how the ground has suddenly shifted. \nA crowd of 25,000 people watching women playing football, we'd like to see that.
