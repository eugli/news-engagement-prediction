Please don't freeze your penis or vagina to try to improve your sex life \nThe research, which surveyed 1,000 singletons, showed that 63% of people find dog owners are more attractive, compared to just 18% of people who preferred felines (and their owners). \nThe news should surprise no one. Dogs are fun, loyal and energetic – all must-have personality traits for a future partner. \nIt’s not just a cliché to say that they’re man’s best friend. Dogs are better company than most humans, so anyone with a pooch to hand has good taste. \nFor anyone who still doesn’t agree , here’s why dog people are infinitely better than cat-lovers. (Picture: Getty) 1. Dog owners are fit \nAs friendly as they are, you can’t deny that dogs are harder work than cats. They are balls of fury energy, and need around an hour of exercise every day, according to the Kennel Club . \nDog-owners are always willing to step out of the house and jog with their pet to keep them happy, so they’re in better shape. They’re literally fitter than cat owners. 2. But cat owners hate the outdoors \nCat owners have bought the largest animal they can afford which requires the least effort to look after. Being inside is great, but ‘convenience’ is not a reason to love a pet, and it’s not a reason to choose a partner, either. 3. Cats are fundamentally disloyal \nI love cats, but they’re hardly reliable. If an axe-wielding murderer broke into my house at night, I’m not counting on the cat I’ve looked after for years to step in and help us both escape. \nThe cat will be gone as soon as the intruder opens the window. Likewise, cat owners are hardened and don’t count on anyone. They expect you to be the same. (Picture: Getty) 4. Whereas dogs will always be there for you \nWorking from home? Your dog is there to keep you entertained. Going to the shops? Your dog wants to walk with you. Making a sandwich? Your dog wants to help (well, eat scraps). \nDog people are the same. They will always cheer you up when you’re down, and never hold a grudge if you snap at them. 5. Dog people are always on the look-out for adventure \nThose long walks in the park are just the backdrop for another day of meeting new people and learning more about the world around you. Dogs and their owners are curious and adventurous, which are both good signs for a partner. 6. They always greet you with a big kiss \nEveryone loves to feel loved. Dog people love everyone. (Picture: Getty) 7. Dog owners will make better parents \nDogs are a great way to prepare for having small children. They love baby-talk, they obey simple commands, and they’re messy. If your partner can keep a dog alive and happy, they’re marriage material. 8. Dog people are more creative than cat people \nDogs have this strange way of playing. They like to play-fight, chase and be chased. \nLikewise, dog owners are pretty good at keeping up with their pets and playing along, meaning their imaginations are as big as their hearts. 9. But they don’t think they’re better than you \nThere have been multiple studies showing how cat owners are more intelligent than dog owners, but that only means one thing: cat people are smug. No one wants a partner who thinks they’re somehow better than you because they’re too lazy to get a dog. (Picture: Getty) 10. Dog owners are great communicators \nAs with any animal, there’s a bit of a language barrier when it comes to learning house rules. \nDogs communicate through body language, so their owners know that some things don’t need to be said to be understood.They know you’re angry before you’ve even opened your mouth. 11. They’re more comfortable in social settings \nCousin’s wedding? Office party? Dog owners have you covered. Years of people coming over to pet their dog when they’re out for a walk have trained them in the art of small talk. 12. Which means your parents will love them \nA sociable, loyal animal-lover who jogs for fun and will come to family functions? It’s a parent’s dream come true. (Picture: Getty) 13. Dogs owners let the little things go \nDog owners know if you try to wash your pet, they’re just going to roll in fox poo an hour later. Dog people learn to roll with the punches and live in the moment. 14. They’re easy to buy presents for \nDog owners like anything their pet can play with. Just buy them a tennis ball for their birthday and watch their face light up with pure, undiluted joy. 15. And of course, dog owners have a dog \nLet’s be honest, who hasn’t thought about dating someone to get to their dog?
