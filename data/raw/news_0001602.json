Not a happy bunny in the slightest. View photos Copyright: [Instagram] The historic emails – allegedly sent by David to his PR Simon Oliveira – show him raging against the UK honours committee for failing to offer him the title of 'Sir’ David. 'They’re a bunch of c**** I expected nothing less. Who decides on the honours? 'It’s a disgrace to be honest and if I was American I would of got something like this ten years ago.’ The emails were published on the Football Leaks website and have been picked up by a variety of European outlets as well as The Sun. Becks - who appeared on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs for it’s anniversary special last week - also slammed Katherine Jenkins, who had received an OBE the same year. Referencing her admission to taking cocaine, David wrote: 'Katherine Jenkins OBE for what? Singing at the rugby and going to see the troops plus taking coke. F***ing joke.’ View photos Copyright: [Instagram] Gosh, he sounds like some kind of angry uncle that you only end up seeing once a year, doesn’t he? Despite his client’s anger, Dave’s PR, Simon, told him: 'We need to remain dignified if asked[about the snub], but if you want me to work up something cutting I will work up one, but my advice is it’s not productive.” He then wrote another email to Becks’ agent, in which he detailed the charm offensive he hoped David would go, writing: “This gives us even more reason to work this year on Unicef, the armed forces, and other charitable commitments.” No such thing as a selfless act, eh Dave? No response as of yet from David Beckham OBE (sorry, couldn’t resist), but last night his PR told The Sun the information was “stolen and hacked”. Yikes.
