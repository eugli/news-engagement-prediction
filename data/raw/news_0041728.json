All dreads and peasant skirts, the free-spirited beauty practically created the ’90s uniform of floral slip dresses, distressed combat boots, and velvet outerwear (sans bra, of course) during her heyday. But now, at 49, Bonet shows no sign of slowing down in the style department. Stepping out in Los Angeles today, the mother of Zoë Kravitz (with rocker Lenny) and two younger children (with her Game of Thrones –star husband, Jason Momoa) sported a low-key ensemble that was high on vibes. Bonet breezed along in a vintage Jimi Hendrix Experience band tee over a wispy black peasant skirt, accented by black leather brogues. Beaded bracelets flanked the dedicated yogi’s wrists and ankles, while she coolly threw a messenger bag over her shoulder. Her trademark dreads were pulled off her face, while a pair of rounded sunglasses were perched on her nose. It was a mellow and liberating finish to a look that, after all these years, still comes naturally.
