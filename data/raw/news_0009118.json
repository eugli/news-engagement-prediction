Advertisement A harbinger of the ill will he faces is that Trump, through the end of January, had the fewest Cabinet nominees confirmed of any president in the last 40 years. No matter how Democrats feel about Trump, he has the right to assemble a Cabinet of his own choosing. By the same time in 2009, President Obama had 14 confirmed Cabinet nominees. President Bush in 2001 had 15. Trump? Just four. Barely enough to organize a tea party in a dollhouse. Complicating matters are the hard feelings left over from Obama’s 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland, which gathered dust because the GOP refused to take it up in a presidential election year. This is not a presidential election year, but that will not stop Democrats from playing tit for tat. Republicans have a 52-seat majority, so they’ll need to win over at least eight Democrats to break a filibuster. But if not, they should just take a page from the Democrat playbook. In 2013, when the Democrats last had the majority, they did away with the 60-vote threshold for all executive and judicial appointments except the Supreme Court. But what is the reason for keeping that fig leaf in place? Does anyone doubt that if Democrats had 51 votes for Garland last year they would not have triggered the “nuclear option” for the Supreme Court? Winning the confirmation battle for his first Supreme Court pick will give Trump an important political victory. Republicans in the Senate should use whatever means necessary to get the job done.
