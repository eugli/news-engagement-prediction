Though 12 years old, he had the “physical stature and appearance” of an 8-year-old, prosecutors said. \nThe home stank of urine and feces, and police saw urine on the mattress and carpet of a bathroom, police said. \nUtah man charged for sending 2 wives to kill teen girl he abused \nAs police waited about 90 minutes for Bronte to come home, the boy rocked back and forth, didn’t open his eyes, and repeatedly clenched and unclenched his hands, according to the complaint. \nBronte showed up at 6:50 a.m., cops said, and at one point told police, “He’s blind. He suffers from epilepsy and has some sort of autism. I need to give him his medical marijuana. He’s in an experimental program.” \nThe boy is now in the care of an aunt, officials said. Bronte's son, Eliezer, was banging on his home's windows for hours, according to a criminal complaint. \nHouston boy hit with belt 62 times and beaten by mom’s boyfriend \nHer apartment appeared clean and well-furnished Tuesday night. \n“I'm a loving and good mother,” said Bronte, noting that she has a three-year-old daughter, works as a waitress and studies dental hygiene at City Tech in Brooklyn. \nEliezer isn’t toilet trained, she said, and often bangs on the window. “He does that with me. It's all day every day. He takes off his onesie and he bangs on the windows,” Bronte said. \nBronte, who’s on probation after police found her with 350 glassine envelopes of heroin in a car in August 2015, was arraigned Tuesday on a felony endangering the welfare of an incompetent or physically disabled person charge. She’s also charged with child endangerment, according to District Attorney Michael McMahon’s office. \n“That was me being with somebody else. I got caught in the crossfire,” she said of the drug case. Police said the Staten Island home stank of urine and feces. (Ken Murray/NEW YORK DAILY NEWS) \nShe was released on $15,000 bail. \nHer lawyer, Joseph Sorrentino, said \\Eliezer is not neglected or intentionally malnourished. His disability is so severe, that he doesn’t sleep at night, and has several seizures every day, making feeding him very difficult, Sorrentino said. \n“Between his medicines and his condition, it is very, very, very difficult to get him to keep food down or to even eat to begin with,” he said. “His family tries to get him to drink supplements in order to make up for the calories he doesn’t take in with food.” \nOhio parents charged after 8-year-old son overdoses on heroin \nHe’s undergoing an experimental medical marijuana treatment at Beth Israel Hospital, Sorrentino said. \n“If somebody's alleging mistreatment of a 12-year-old severely disabled child, of course we all understand the initial reaction will be very aggressive,” he said. \n“However, I believe that we will be able to present to the district attorney's office ample evidence that Ms. Bronte did not mistreat or neglect her son. She loves her son and she wants what's best for him.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:51:17.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
