I thought he formulated a beautiful plan. He played really well, and to score 60 and 30 in his first game on that wicket at the age of [20] is an incredible achievement. \n\"Hopefully we can see more improvement from the guys going forward, but [I'm] really proud of that performance.\" \nBizarrely, some of the current crop will only have happy memories of playing in India, which is even more unbelievable considering the pitch they thrived. \nThe curator offered up what Smith called the \"driest ... most inconsistent spinning surface I've ever seen\". \nThose sort of rank turners are supposed to be kryptonite for Australia's batsmen and bowlers, but it was the tourists who looked at home. \nNow the eyes turn to the Bangalore strip for the second Test. \n\"It'll be interesting to see what they come up with,\" he said. \n\"But to know that we can play the way we can and outplay them so convincingly in these conditions, it's very pleasing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:07:13.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
