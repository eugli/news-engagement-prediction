So it's easy to obtain and also very cheap,\" said Daraio. \nIntrigued, the team shifted its attention to pectin and ultimately created a thin, transparent flexible film of pectin and water, which can be as little as 20 micrometres thick (equivalent to the diameter of a human hair). \nPectin molecules in the film have a weakly bonded double-strand structure that contains calcium ions. \nResearchers say that the film senses temperature using a mechanism similar - but not identical - to the pit organs in vipers, which allow the snakes to sense warm prey in the dark by detecting radiated heat. \nIn those organs, ion channels in the cell membrane of sensory nerve fibres expand as temperature increases. \nThis dilation allows calcium ions to flow, triggering electrical impulses, the researchers explained. \nA paper about the new material will be published in Science Robotics on February 1. \n(With IANS inputs) First Published: Tuesday, January 31, 2017 - 09:02 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:00:07.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
