First, Jackman is too tall, and second, he's never worn the iconic yellow costume. Director James Mangold , who directed both The Wolverine and Logan, says that part of the reason the recognizable costume has never appeared is because he simply doesn't see why this version of Wolverine would ever wear it. \nI always feel a certain contingent of fans who are yearning for it. But the biggest block I've had -- I'm willing to take the heat for it -- is that, I can never get past, being a writer for these movies as well, that Logan is the least narcissistic of all the superheroes, any kind I can think of -- Marvel, DC or anywhere else. What I mean by that is, who puts a special branded outfit on when they do good deeds? And why? The only reason you do it is so you can have some sort of trademarked claim and get credit for what you did. Nothing seems less Wolverine-like than the desire to put on a trademarked outfit , particularly canary yellow, and kind of prance about doing good deeds and have people go, 'Oh my God! It's The Wolverine!' At least the Wolverine, as I see him. That's a real struggle for me, and always has been. I somehow feel that if somehow we ever put Hugh [Jackman] into one of those outfits, people would not be happy. Essentially, it's something that lives on the page and I'm not sure could live anywhere else. \nIn the very first X-Men movie, Wolverine makes a snide comment about the black uniforms that the team wears, and is asked if he'd prefer yellow spandex. It's the only time the classic outfit is referenced, and it's done in such a way to imply that Logan doesn't really understand the point of wearing a uniform at all. While the character has worn uniforms on film when working with other X-Men, he's never done it in his solo films. We can't really argue with James Mangold's comments to Screen Rant . While Logan has certainly come around as the character has evolved on screen, he's still something of a lone wolf. Does it really make sense that he would have a special outfit for fighting bad guys? Does he care that much about clothes? \nBased on this information, it would seem that any indication that Hugh Jackman might put on the yellow and brown for his swan song in Logan would seem to be false flags. While there had been some teasing that such a thing might happen, it looks like we might only see Wolverine's original look in the comic books we see in the movie. \nDo you wish Logan had put on the old school costume or is this version of Wolverine better without it?
