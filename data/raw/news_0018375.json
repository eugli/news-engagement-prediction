So, it should come as no surprise that not every member of the New England Patriots wants to visit Trump at the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl LI victory over the Atlanta Falcons. \nTight end Martellus Bennett was the first to boycott the trip, telling the media he wouldn’t go even before the Pats won the big game. A handful of Bennett’s teammates have now followed suit. \nHere are the Patriots who won’t be attending the team’s trip to Washington, D.C. and what they had to say about it: Bennett : “It is what it is. People know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter.” \nFree safety Devin McCourty : “Basic reason for me is I don’t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won’t.” \nRunning back James White* : “I’ll wait ’til the time comes and decide then.” \nLinebacker Dont’a Hightower : “Been there, done that.” \nDefensive end Chris Long : “Planned on skipping, hadn’t been asked. Don’t need an open letter explaining my own words to me.” \nRunning back LeGarrette Bloun t: “I will NOT be going to the White House. I don’t feel welcome in that house. I’ll leave it at that.” \n* White said he’s considering skipping the trip but hasn’t decided. \nThumbnail photo via James Lang/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:03:18.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
