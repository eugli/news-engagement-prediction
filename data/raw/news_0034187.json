FAIRFAX NZ \nAbout 50 rusty cars sit on the Mangere property. \nThe airport's general manager of property, Mark Thomson, confirmed on Saturday that the airport had signed a sale and purchase agreement with the McIvor family. \nREAD MORE: \nNo sale price was disclosed, but the four-hectare property has a capital value of $10.25 million. FAIRFAX NZ \nThe McIvor farm fronts onto busy George Bolt Memorial Drive. \nJohn McIvor told NZME that the farm had fetched a \"reasonable\" price. \n\"We weren't going to be pushed out in a hurry,\" he said. \n\"We didn't intend to, but they've been at us since 1986.\" \n﻿ \nThomson said the purchase was a \"logical acquisition\" for the airport. \n\"The land is on the corner of a key intersection at the entrance to Auckland Airport, where we already own the adjacent sites. \n\"Owning this site therefore affords us more flexibility to build the infrastructure and other developments that may be necessary to accommodate growth.\"​ \nMcIvor told NZME that he and his siblings would remain on the property until 2018, when they intended to buy land elsewhere. \nThat arrangement had \"​afforded a level of flexibility which reflects the good faith in which it was agreed\", Thomson said. \nIt is understood that the front of the property will be used for widening George Bolt Memorial Drive, which is also known as State Highway 20A. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:20:50.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
