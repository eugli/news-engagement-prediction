I want to, more than anything, create a moment that everyone that’s watching will never forget,” she said at a news conference Thursday in Houston. \nLady Gaga wouldn’t reveal what songs she would sing, how many costumes she’ll wear or any staging details, but promised a “tremendously athletic” show and no reappearance of her infamous meat dress. \nThe 13-minute concert will also feature an appearance by Tony Bennett, whom Lady Gaga called a “tremendously wise man.” Lady Gaga and Bennett recorded the 2014 album of duets, “Cheek to Cheek.” \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
