Hosted by the Chicago-based Frank Lloyd Wright Trust, “Wright on Film” will show two feature length documentary films exploring the designer’s legacy at the Chicago History Museum, located at 1601 N. Clark Street in Lincoln Park. Both free events will feature a live introduction by the Trust’s curator David Bagnall. First up, a film titled Frank Lloyd Wright: A Film by Ken Burns & Lynn Novick is scheduled for Tuesday, March 14th at 5:30 PM. Co-directed by master documentarian Ken Burns , the 1998 piece tells the story of Wright’s impressive career and turbulent personal life, including the time the Prairie School architect spent honing his craft in Chicago. The film features many notable structures including Unity Temple, the Johnson Wax Building, Fallingwater (pictured above), the Guggenheim Museum, Taliesin, and Hyde Park’s Frederick C. Robie House. Frank Lloyd Wright Trust Exactly one week later on Tuesday, March 21st at 5:30 PM, the same venture will present Magnificent Obsession: Frank Lloyd Wright's Buildings and Legacy in Japan. This 2008 film tells the story of Wright’s life-long interest in Japan and how traditional Japanese design influenced his body of work. Wright’s six-year effort to design the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo along with the American architect’s impact on future Japanese designers is also chronicled. The event is free and space is limited.
