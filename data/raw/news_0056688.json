Trump has not yet revealed the subject of his speech, but Schlapp said he hopes it is heartfelt. \"I hope it's from the heart and I hope he talks to us about what he wants to do with his agenda,\" he said. \"(Conservatives) are really pleased to have a direct impact on policy and they want to hear practically how is this going to manifest itself over the course of the next weeks and months.\" Sections", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:27:21.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
