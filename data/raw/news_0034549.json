Gerrard has since returned to Liverpool as an academy coach \n\"It's a real honour to be sharing the pitch with such a great team of legends whilst raising money for the club's official charity.\" \nClub ambassador Fowler will captain the Reds side with Liverpool's record goalscorer Rush acting as player manager. Gerrard won a treble with Liverpool in 2001 and won the Champions League in 2005 \nAll proceeds will go to the LFC Foundation - the club's official charity. Funds raised will support the charity's programmes and partnerships, which aim to improve the health and life chances of children and young people in Merseyside and beyond. \nAndrea Cooper, head of the LFC Foundation, said: \"We are delighted that Steven will be joining us for the first official Legends game to be held at Anfield. It promises to be a fantastic day for all involved. \n\"We hope the fans enjoy watching so many Liverpool FC and Real Madrid greats on the pitch, and raising vital funds to support the work of the LFC Foundation.\" Robbie Fowler and Jamie Carragher will also feature in charity game \nThe game is a rematch of the Coraz√≥n Classic match which took place in June 2015 at the Santiago Bernabeu. \nLiverpool took a two-goal lead in that game, courtesy of goals from Michael Owen and Harry Kewell, before Real came back to win 4-2.
