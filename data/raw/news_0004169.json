Every fan has talked to us about how exciting the race is when it starts. Some stay with us throughout (the race) and then come back for that finish.” \n“We wanted to make sure we had some of those moments during the race, too,” O’Donnell added. “But more importantly, rewarding drivers throughout the race.” \nIn possibly one of the biggest moves NASCAR has made in collaboration with all of its stakeholders, it’s a safe bet that fans will be rewarded with intense racing action from flag-to-flag, as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:51:22.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
