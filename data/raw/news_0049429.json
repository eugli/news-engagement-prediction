for places a little more undiscovered, these European cities are for you, according to the travel experts at Jetsetter.com. \n1. SEVILLE, SPAIN Seville has a lot to offer tourists, but it’s still local at heart. Source: Supplied \nMost people head to Barcelona or Madrid, but Seville in southern Spain is an Andalusian gem. Come here for delicious tapas, afternoon siestas, cortados at sidewalk cafes, and the relaxed lifestyle emblematic of Spanish culture — then stay for the city’s architecture and culture. Don’t miss the magnificent Plaza de España and the mudejar Alcázar palace (also known as Dorne to Game of Thrones fans). Though Seville has much to offer tourists, the city still feels local at heart, especially the neighbourhoods of Triana, famous for its tile workshops, and the area surrounding the 16th-century Alameda de Hercules, which features a fresh market, jazz bars, and al fresco cafes for an evening glass of wine. \n2. RIGA, LATVIA Riga offers an eclectic mix of history and modern art. Source: istock \nMore than 800 years old and rich in history, Riga is the Baltic region’s largest city and was named the European Capital of Culture in 2014. Take in the old Gothic spires of the Riga Cathedral and its collection of art nouveau buildings, the largest in the world. Then check out the city’s burgeoning alternative scene (see the Kanepes cultural centre), modern art centres, odd museums (one is entirely dedicated to the sun’s role in Latvian culture) and experimental restaurants for a taste of the new. \n3. LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA The Slovenian capital is lively and picturesque. Picture: Darko Bandic Source: AP \nPronounced “lyoob-lee-yah-nah,” Slovenia’s tiny capital (population 300,000) is perfect for those who love to wander. Slip on your walking shoes and stroll through the artsy pastel-coloured city and the tiny lanes that fan out from the Old Town’s city square. It’s also worth it to take in the views from the hilltop castle, and browse the works at the Museum of Contemporary Art, which houses the country’s collection of 20th-century Slovene art. Those who are after a more alternative scene can’t miss Metelkova, an autonomous arts community in the city centre, with live music, colourful murals, funky studios, and dive bars. \n4. ZAGREB, CROATIA Zagreb has a unique mix of Venetian and Yugoslavian influences. Source: Supplied \nMost people picture beaches when they think Croatia, turning toward Dubrovnik and Split first, but the landlocked capital is a gem of its own. Originating within the first five centuries A.D., it’s a patchwork of previous identities, from Venetian to Yugoslavian — all the while forging its own culture (Croatia has, after all, only been a country since 1991). Wander narrow, twisting streets; visit the Museum of Broken Relationships (no, that’s not a joke); try some potent rakija; and pay a visit to the Gothic St. Mark’s Cathedral. \n5. BRUGES, BELGIUM Bruges is home to exceptional handmade chocolate. Source: Supplied \nBrussels might be the most well-known of Belgium’s cities, but the capital doesn’t hold a candle to Bruges when it comes to romance. Stroll the cobblestone streets by the medieval city centre and its stunning belfry, then hop a boat to cruise along the network of quiet canals (it is called Venice of the North, after all). Back on land, the chocolate shops are a Belgium staple (we’re obsessed with Aux Merveilleux de Fred), the mussels and frites are excellent, and a pint or two of Belgian beer in a cozy pub is a must (some have more than 100 different kinds). \n6. KRAKOW, POLAND Krakow’s market square is stunning at sunset. Source: Supplied \nIn recent years, Krakow’s experienced a revitalisation thanks to a thriving new arts scene and a much-needed facelift of its architecture. Europe’s largest market square, the 14th-century St. Mary’s Basilica, and Wawel Castle, below which legend says a dragon once dwelled, are all historic draws. Meanwhile, an abundance of galleries (Art Decorum, Starmach Gallery, and Otwarta Pracownia collective are worthy stops), independent cinemas (like Agrafka) and museums (the Museum of Contemporary Art is hosted within Schindler’s former factory) serve up a hearty culture fix. But in order to get a true picture of Krakow, it’s essential to look to its tragic past: spend some time in the Jewish Quarter — one of the five major ghettos created by the Nazis — then take a short train ride to take a sombre but necessary tour of Auschwitz. \n7. TALLINN, ESTONIA Surprisingly, Tallinn offers sandy beaches as well as stunning architecture. Source: Supplied \nWith one foot in the past (the Old Town is a UNESCO World Heritage site) and one in the future (an exploding start-up scene), Tallinn is throwing off the connotations that come with the weight of “post-Soviet” as a descriptor. Formerly a stag party destination thanks to its boozy side, this European city is beginning to attract tourists that are drawn to its sandy beaches, medieval Old Town streets, charming Estonian Open-Air Museum and Town Hall Square. \n8. COIMBRA, PORTUGAL The University of Coimbra is one of the oldest universities in the world. Source: istock \nThis romantic riverside city is home to a 12th-century cathedral and the oldest university in Portugal — which means that during the summer months when the students are away, the city has the feel of a quaint town. However, May is the best time to visit, because it’s one of the only times to catch Coimbra’s take on fado, a haunting genre of music that’s popular (and historically rooted) in Lisbon. Two things not to miss: the Botanical Gardens, which are the country’s biggest, and Conímbriga, Portugal’s most impressive Roman ruins, just outside the city. \n9. VALLETTA, MALTA You can’t travel to Valletta by land, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t visit. Source: istock \nMost come to Malta for the beaches and sun, but its cosmopolitan capital, Valletta, shouldn’t be overlooked. The tiny city (population 5,700) is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site for the crop of historic buildings found within its fortified walls. Built in 1565 for soldiers coming back from the Crusades, the city’s incredible St. John’s Co-Cathedral, Grand Master’s Palace and stunning examples of Baroque architecture pay living tribute to its past. That being said, don’t ignore the beach: The Mediterranean Sea that surrounds it on three sides has picture-perfect azure water and soft sand. \n10. GENOA, ITALY There is so much more to Genoa than its beautiful harbour. Source: istock \nGenoa’s pink-and-yellow harbour may be its most popular site, but a lot of history can be found hidden in the Caruggi District’s alleyways. There’s the stunning baroque Santi Ambrogio e Andrea church, which dates back to the turn of the 17th century, as well as the Romanesque-Gothic-Renaissance Cathedral of San Lorenzo, which claims to hold the ashes of St. John the Baptist. Don’t miss the labyrinthine sailors’ quarter with its opulent National Gallery, Italy’s largest aquarium, and Christopher Columbus’s childhood home. And if there’s one city in Italy that can beat Venice’s medieval palaces, it’s Genoa: Find them at the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Via Garibaldi, a narrow lane where noble families during the city’s golden 16th and 17th centuries built magnificent residences. Although none are available to tour, the facades alone are worth the detour. \nThis article originally appeared on Jetsetter.com and was reproduced with permission.
