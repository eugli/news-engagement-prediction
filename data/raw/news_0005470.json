The outgoing chief, Mark Morgan, was forced out of his job, according to a report by The Associated Press. The move came shortly after Trump issued an executive order to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border — which Trump had promised he'd do during the campaign — and crack down on illegal immigration.\nMorgan took office in October and was expected to tackle corruption within the agency.\nHowever, the former FBI official — the first outsider to helm Border Patrol in its 92-year history — did not appear destined to remain in the Trump administration.\nDuring his short tenure, Morgan appeared to lose the support of the National Border Patrol Council, a union that represents 18,000 agents.\nMembers of the union’s executive board published an op-ed on Breitbart's website in November that called Morgan “a disgrace to the Border Patrol” who “does not have the will necessary to secure the border.”\nCongress\nHill staffers secretly worked on Trump's immigration order By Rachael Bade , Jake Sherman and Josh Dawsey\nThe union endorsed Trump in the presidential election and maintains influence within his administration.\nVitiello has earned praise from union officials. He served as acting chief of Border Patrol for nearly a year before handing the reins to Morgan.\nThe union thanked Vitiello in a statement issued at the time.\n“Deputy Chief Vitiello has served as an example of what all law enforcement managers should strive to be: a fair, competent leader who took care of his people while accomplishing the mission,” the statement said.", "external_links": ["https://apnews.com/1552a2a8859e49318fbf4f940eab5926", "http://www.bpunion.org/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/1837-mark-morgan-named-chief-of-the-us-border-patrol", "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/11/30/exclusive-border-patrol-agents-chief-obama-gave-us-disgrace/"], "published": "2017-01-31T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:00:26.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
