Her voice was molasses slow, seeping in between the crevices of beats. The music she made existed in some strange continuum between Siouxsie and the Banshees and Massive Attack . Now, after a nearly four-year hiatus, she returns with “Something’s Up,” an ominously quiet piece of ambient pop. \nElsewhere was a bit of minimalist before, and on “Something’s Up,” she pares away even the suggestion of melody. The song is mostly shaped around an undulating, narcotic synth line that recalls Caroline Polachek’s recent solo experimentations with pure tones and sonic whispers. Her voice, unlike her selection of sounds, is processed wildly—swerving from a sleepy whisper to a chilling, robotic drawl. Only the minimal background presence of hand drums keep the track from dissolving completely. Otherwise, her voice barely feels tethered to this earth. Rather, it hangs like a wisp of fog, never creepy and somehow pleasantly inviting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:22:48.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
