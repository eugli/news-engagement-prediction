Heidi Hsia Tweet Share 21 Feb - Rumour has it that Barbie Hsu's husband and businessman Wang Xiaofei has been fined NTD 500,000 (USD 16,217) for running his hotel business without a license, NBD News reported. Wang previously made a multi-million investment establishing his own boutique hotel, known as S Hotel, as a tribute to his actress wife - known to many as Big S. Although the hotel is expected to open in April this year, it recently held its trial run and had also accepted several early bookings. However, it was reported that the Taipei City Government has recently fined the hotel after receiving complaints from people about its lack of license to operate. When asked about it recently, S Hotel's Public Relations Director, Jesse responded that they have already applied for license, and that the hotel is currently undergoing quality inspection and a trial run. She stressed that for now, both the fire safety and security aspects of the hotel have passed inspection. As for the fine, Jesse shared that the hotel hasn't received any notice for the time being. On the other hand, when asked about the hotel's issue, Barbie stated that she would rather not comment on it as she is not familiar about the operation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:15:15.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
