The exact coordinates are 37°58 17.45 N / 23°43 34.29 E What kind of Greek temple is the Parthenon? \nThe Parthenon in Athens is considered to be the finest example of Doric-style construction. What is Doric style? \nDoric is a simple, unadorned style characterized by plainer columns. Find out \"How to tell Greek Columns Apart\" here . Who built the Parthenon in Athens? \nThe Parthenon was designed by Phidias, a famous sculptor, at the behest of Pericles, a Greek politician credited with the founding of the city of Athens and with stimulating the so-called \"Golden Age of Greece\". The Greek architects Ictinos and Callicrates supervised the practical work of the construction. \ncontinue reading below our video Tips for Taking Better Travel Photos Alternate spellings for these names include Iktinos, Kallikrates, and Pheidias - there is no official transliteration of Greek into English, resulting in many alternate spellings. What was in the Parthenon? \nMany treasures would have been displayed in the building, but the glory of the Parthenon was the gigantic statue of Athena designed by Phidias and made out of chryselephantine (elephant ivory) and gold. When was the Parthenon built? \nWork on the building began in 447 BCE and continued over a period of about nine years until 438 BCE; some of the decorations were completed later. It was built over the site of an earlier temple which is sometimes called the Pre-Parthenon. There were probably even earlier Mycenean remains on the Acropolis as some pottery fragments have been found there. How big is the Parthenon? \nExperts differ on this because of variations in the way it is measured, and due to damage to the structure. One common measurement is 111 feet by 228 feet, or 30.9 meters by 69.5 meters. What does Parthenon mean? Why is it called the Parthenon? \nThe temple was sacred to two aspects of the Greek goddess Athena, Athena Polios (\"of the city\") and Athena Parthenos (\"young maiden\"). The \"on\" ending means \"place of\", so \"Parthenon\" means \"Place of the Parthenos\". Why is the Parthenon in ruins? \nThe Parthenon survived the ravages of time pretty well, serving as a church and then a mosque, until finally it was used as a munitions depot during the Turkish Occupation of Greece. In 1687, during a battle with the Venetians, an explosion tore through the building and caused much of the damage seen today. There was also a damaging fire in ancient times. What is the \"Elgin Marbles\" or \"Parthenon Marbles\" controversy? \nLord Elgin, an Englishman, claimed he received permission from the local Turkish authorities to remove whatever he wanted from the ruins of the Parthenon. But based on surviving documents, he apparently interpreted even that \"permission\" quite liberally - it may not have included shipping out marbles to England. The Greek government has been demanding the return of the Parthenon Marbles and an entire vacant floor awaits them at the New Acropolis Museum . At present, they are displayed at the British Museum in London, England. What is the Acropolis? \nThe Acropolis is the hill in Athens on which the Parthenon stands. \"Acro\" means \"high\" and \"polis\" means \"city\" - so it is literally the \"high city\". Many other places in Greece have \"an\" acropolis, such as Corinth in the Peloponnese, but \"The Acropolis\" usually refers to the site of the Parthenon in Athens. \nIn addition to the obvious classical monuments, there are much more ancient remains from the Mycenean period and even earlier. You can also see from a distance the sacred caves which once were used for rites to Dionysos and other Greek deities, though they are not generally open to the public. The New Acropolis Museum is located beside the rock of the Acropolis, and holds many of the finds from the Acropolis and Parthenon. It replaced the old museum which was located on top of the Acropolis itself. \nVisiting the Acropolis and Parthenon \nMany companies offer tours of the Parthenon and the Acropolis. You can also join a tour for a small fee in addition to your admission at the site itself, or just wander about on your own and read the curation cards, though the information they contain is relatively limited. \nPictures of the Acropolis and Parthenon \nHere's a tip - the best picture of the Parthenon is from the far end, not the first view that you get after climbing through the propylaion. That presents a hard angle for most cameras, while the shot from the other end is easy to get. And then turn around - you'll be able to take some great pictures of Athens itself from the same location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:35:18.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
