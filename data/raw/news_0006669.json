So that's in the last three months.\" External Link: Ross Dennerstein Trust \nThe cause of the father-of-three's death has since been identified as sudden cardiac arrest — something an estimated 15,000 Australians die from each year, including many young people. \nIn the face of such personal tragedy, his family has set up the Ross Dennerstein Trust to help fund research into causes and prevention. \nCardiologist and Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute Associate Professor Andre La Gerche is backing the trust and said far more work was needed in this area of medicine. \n\"I think that tragedies such as occurred for Ross and the family are not as uncommon as we think,\" he said. \n\"In the young, under the age of about 35, it is one in 50,000 and becomes far more common through middle age and beyond. \n\"This puts it in the same sort of range as issues such as suicide, car accidents, drug use, things for which there is major public health campaigns, whereas this does seem to fly under the radar and is an all-too-common tragedy.\" \nDr La Gerche said data from a US registry of sudden death amongst college athletes showed cardiovascular causes represented a similar proportion to suicide and drugs combined and exceeded that due to trauma, including car accidents. \nIn Australia, while there is no national registry for causes of sudden death, Dr La Gerche found a comparison of multiple databases suggested a similar picture. \n\"There is much more work to be done,\" he said. \n\"We are really on the starting process for what I think could have a big impact.\" \nFor Ms Dennerstein and the rest of the family, establishing the trust in the hopes of helping prevent other deaths is an important part of the grieving process. \n\"I think it helps us enormously to know that we might be preventing this happening to other families,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:20:24.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
