Enter Hugo Lloris. According to The Telegraph , the Spurs keeper is on Real's shortlist for a new No.1. \nThe reigning Champions League winners are eager to fill a world-class keeper between the sticks once their transfer ban ends in the summer. \nIn spite of the Frenchman only putting pen-to-paper on a new deal in December which keeps him at the club till 2022. \nBut will Lloris reject Zizou's advances? The report also suggest that Lloris would be an easier acquisition than the two previous names. Do you agree? \nChelsea's main man in goal has come under intense transfer speculation about his future following the interest shown by Real. Though a move away is in the balance as the Spanish giants monitor an alternative. \nAs well as working under the French legend, Real would also be prepared to double Lloris' Â£100,000-a-week wage to take him to the iconic Bernabeu. \nThis news comes after the Los Blancos are reportedly keeping tabs on Dele Alli. Will either men leave for the Spanish capital? Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:54:53.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
