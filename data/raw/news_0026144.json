The movie hits theaters on May 25, 2018. \nThe first “Star Wars Story,” “Rogue One,” has set the bar high. Along with overwhelmingly positive reviews, the film has already grossed more than a billion dollars worldwide since opening Dec. 16. \nCutting her teeth in British TV realm in shows like “Broadchurch” and “Drifters”, Waller-Bridge broke out on the scene with her series “Crashing.” She would follow that series up with her Amazon series “Fleabag”, which she created and stars in. \nThe show has already received critical acclaim earning Critics Choice nominations for series and Waller Bridge. \nShe is repped by UTA and Independent Talent Group.
