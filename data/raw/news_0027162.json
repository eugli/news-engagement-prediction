Now, it’s permeated the cleaning business. \nWhat could be better than making chores less tedious, and being paid extra for it? \nSo when owner Laura Smith invited me to the suburban Surrey home of her client David*, a close friend of hers who is naturist and gave her the idea for the business concept, I jumped at the chance. Deni Kirkova 10 Brave Deni Kirkova took up the challenge to try cleaning in the buff \nNaturist Cleaners undertake chores including dusting, tidying, sweeping, mopping, cleaning kitchen surfaces and bathrooms, ironing, vacuuming, watering plants, making beds, using the washing machine and cleaning windows. \nArriving at David’s pristine home, I felt quite nervous and excited too. \nWe exchanged hellos and graces before he popped out for an hour to let me get on with scrubbing the place up. \nNaturist Cleaners clients may stay in the house, though, while a naked cleaner goes about the mopping and ironing. \nDuring my trial shift I observed David’s lovely home – all white, grey, airy and modern – and there wasn’t too much to do. \nI began by taking my time ironing out the creases in a navy blue shirt in the dining room. @TobyShawPhoto 10 Deni stripped off and started on the ironing, as task she said felt surprisingly soothing while in the buff \nI don’t think I’ve ever found ironing quite as relaxing as I did while entirely in the nude. \nAdmittedly I find ironing quite a meditative practice, but there’s something even lovelier about doing it starkers. \nIndeed, the odd boob and bum cheek may have brushed up against a wall, door, soft furnishing or garment. \nBut as a naturist himself I don’t imagine David would have minded at all had he found out, and so I didn’t consider this inappropriate for a second. \nDespite initial nerves and reservations I felt free, liberated, and quite comfortable with no apron or tight clothes getting in the way. @TobyShawPhoto Deni said she felt quite comfortable with no apron or tight clothes getting in the way \nIt somehow made the job easier, more fun and quite soothing. \nI then moved on to dusting the surfaces and TV in the bedroom, cleaning the glass doors in the shower, and finally mopping and cleaning the kitchen floor. \nIt was quite the novelty experience and I embraced my nudity, swanning about in a lively manner scrubbing and tidying up. \nI felt quite giddy and cheeky and wondered how this would go down in my own home, and how my partner might feel walking in on me nonchalantly cleaning our place fully naked. \nGetting in to the shower to clean the glass doors from the inside I felt strangely at home. \nBeing nude I could quite easily take a shower there and then. But that would have been quite unprofessional. @TobyShawPhoto Deni admitted the ‘odd boob and bum cheek may have brushed up against a wall’ while she cleaned in the nude @TobyShawPhoto 10 Deni embraced her nudity and admitted the time she spent cleaning flew by \nI felt more liberated than usual as I wet the doors with the shower head and didn’t mind at all that the water sprinkled all over my body. It dried in no time and no clothes were spoiled in the process. \nAs I mopped the floor I noticed that my bare feet left little marks as feet do. Slippers would indeed have been the wiser choice. \nI grabbed a cloth and wiped it down using this instead, suddenly feeling like a nude Cinderella – quite a strange feeling indeed. \nHaving focussed so much on the novelty of cleaning in the nude I didn’t notice that the house was left sparkling by my efforts. \nBefore I knew it an hour had flown by and it was time for me to, begrudgingly, dress again. @TobyShawPhoto 10 Deni admitted to feeling like ‘a nude Cinderella’ \nFounder Laura, 32, a mother to a small son who recently finished a Masters in Politics, worked on the company as a part-time project and admitted she had no idea it would be so popular. \nShe says of prospective employees: “The main requirements are that the cleaner must be comfortable being nude and knows how to clean. \n“We don’t have any requirements on body type or their look. \n“We’re not keen to take on cleaners who are too young, so aim to employ those aged 21and above. As most of our clients are of a more mature generation we prefer to have cleaners of a similar age just to make everyone is comfortable. \n“Our cleaners wear gloves and we recommend they bring slippers. @TobyShawPhoto The main requirements for signing up with Naturist Cleaners are that the cleaner must be comfortable being nude and knows how to clean Related Stories a load of hot air Judge Rinder speechless by lad who makes £4K a month blowing up balloons and cleaning his TEETH for online fetishists PREGNANT BY A PAEDO Mum-to-be, 16, discovers father of her baby is a PAEDOPHILE while cleaning out his room CHORE BLIMEY!

For just three hours’ cleaning I’d earn a tidy sum for the day – close to half a week’s rent money. @TobyShawPhoto 10 Had Deni been a proper Naturist Cleaners employee this session would have pocketed her close to half a week’s rent money \nThe London-based cleaning agency also offers fully-clothed cleaning in ‘a proper work uniform’– but charges less than half the price for it. \nI certainly think I may take up naked cleaning in my own home, much to the delight of my boyfriend. \nThough I’m not sure I could pursue a career in cleaning other people’s just yet. \nWatch this space… \nFor those interested in pursuing a career in buff cleaning or hiring a nude maid, they can head to Laura’s website .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:52:48.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
