His 22-year-old son, Austin Blaine Brasher, was rushed to the hospital where he died about five hours later. \n“You really just cannot imagine it,” Pamela Brasher Dennis, Jeffrey’s sister, told People Magazine. “There are no words that can be said. Everybody’s life changed on Saturday morning. No one’s life will be the same after this.” \nThe tragedy is one on a long list of struggles for the Brasher family. Relatives told People Austin’s mother has been battling lung cancer and that his sister only just recovered from a recent car accident of her own. Father and son, Jeffrey Morris Brasher and Austin Brasher, both died after a colliding with each other in a fatal head-on collision between their two vehicles on Feb. 18 Bankston, Alabama. (Facebook) \nPolice said alcohol was a factor in the tragic accident that occurred around 4:10 a.m. Saturday on Fayette County 49, near the town of Winfield. Neither father nor son were wearing seatbelts when the elder Brasher’s 2006 Ford pickup crashed into his son’s 2004 Chevrolet pickup, AL.com reported. \n“Austin did drink and was coming home from a party when they crashed,” cousin Monica Marie Aker told the magazine, noting Jeffrey wasn’t much of a drinker. “To know that they collided head-on is one of the hardest things to comprehend. Our whole community is just devastated. \nDennis described Jeffrey and Austin as “very close,” adding they were often spotted together on the local golf course. \n“My worst fear was that Austin would make it through and kill himself because he wouldn’t have been able to deal with killing his father,” Dennis told People. “It would have destroyed him.” \nJeffrey was well-known for his volunteer work and serving as the middle school’s football announcer. Austin was quiet, but popular, Dennis said. \nShe described him as “the life of the party,” adding that “he was the little guy driving the big truck.” \nDennis remembered her brother as a dedicated father who always made his family the top priority. \n“He loved being a husband and father,” she said. “We need to hold on tight to our faith. We love Austin and Jeff and our family will never be the same.” \nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:20:11.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
