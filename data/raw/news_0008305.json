Yah! Yah!\" No. \nMigos'\" Bad and Boujee \" is their most popular song ever (by Billboard standards) and their new album, Culture , is by all means a fantastic one. But, whether in an act of trolling or pure evil, someone decided to ruin everything by taking the first words Lil Uzi Vert says on the song—\"Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah!\"—and looping them over the beat of the song. It's awful, and yet, like watching a car crash video on YouTube, painfully captivating. \nSo to all the folks out there who say the Migos aren't lyricists, we offer this as counter-evidence. Apparently, the song's lyrics are entirely crucial to the success of the song—and not just the famous \"rain drop\" ones. If you can survive the entire song of this new edit, god bless you. You deserve an award. \nReally, this is the perfect thing to send to your office mates today once that 4 P.M. exhaustion sets in to give everyone a good chuckle or at the very least a jolt of bewilderment. After that, though, for everyone's sake please return to the original version of \"Bad and Boujee\" and skip over Uzi Vert's verse like a normal human being.
