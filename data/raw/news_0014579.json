The store planned to open after the game to sell the merchandise, said Doug Evans, a Fox 5 reporter on the scene, in a broadcast .\nDick's Sporting Goods in Buckhead getting the Super Bowl Champion shirts ready.

(The anticipated Falcons victory, that is, not the store shelves.)\nWhen the Pats won the game, Dick’s employees scrambled to pull the Falcons gear that wrongly referred to the Falcons as Super Bowl champs, yanking T-shirts off mannequins and hats off shelves.\nWhen I thought the #Falcons loss couldn't get any more depressing, I ran across this video from ATL.
