The 200cm ruck prospect attended the 2016 draft combine, finishing in the top ten in both the running vertical jump and 20m sprint tests, but went undrafted. \nOlango was born in Kenya to South Sudanese parents and moved to Darwin when he was two years old. The skilled athlete travelled to Scotland when he was 14 and trialled with Glasgow Rangers but suffered a groin injury and returned to Australia. \nNow back in Darwin, Olango has joined the Hawks thanks to a change to the AFL’s Next Generation academy rules. media_camera Tony Olango in action for St Mary’s in the NTFL. \nDarwin was not originally allocated to any clubs but now the five clubs with Next Generation zones in the Northern Territory — Hawthorn, Geelong, Essendon, Collingwood and Melbourne — are able to nominate multicultural players living there for their academies. \nThose players may then be drafted by those clubs using the bidding system discount in place for father-son picks and the selections from NSW and Queensland club academies. \nThe Next Generation system is an attempt to give more opportunities to young people from multicultural and indigenous communities to play AFL. \nHawthorn recruiting and list manager Graham Wright spoke highly of Olango’s potential. \n“He’s an exciting prospect with his height and great athleticism,” he said. \n“He has only played a handful of games, so we can expect to see plenty of development. Joining our academy will assist his understanding of the game, and help to fast track his growth.” \nOlango has spent the last two seasons playing with NTFL side St Mary’s Football Club and NEAFL club NT Thunder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T13:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:30:58.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
