(Instagram) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Sunday, February 5, 2017, 5:00 PM \nAn arrest in the Karina Vetrano case sheds light into the murder investigation of another jogger. \nThe case of the Google executive whose body was found battered in the woods after an August afternoon jog remains open, police and her family said. \nA Massachusetts State Police spokesman told the Daily News Sunday that Vanessa Marcotte’s case remains active, but did not comment on whether investigators have received new updates that may lead to an arrest. \nThe 27-year-old New York City resident vanished on Aug. 7 after jogging in Princeton, Mass. while visiting her mother. \nPICTURED: Chanel Lewis accused of killing jogger Karina Vetrano \nAuthorities believe Marcotte had struggled with her attacker, leaving him with cuts and bruises. \nHer uncle, Steven Therrien, told The News the Worcester County District Attorney’s office is leading the investigation along with State Police and Princeton police. The DA’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Massachusetts State Police search the woods for evidence after Vanessa Marcotte's body was found in August. (David L. Ryan/AP) \nMarcotte's family urged the public to visit their website to learn more about her life and the foundation set up in her name. A 5K fund-raiser organized by one of Marcotte’s high school friends will be held in March, and the proceeds will go to Tutoring Plus of Cambridge. \nIn November, State Police announced that detectives were investigating a suspicious SUV parked near the site where they discovered Marcotte's body. Officials believe the vehicle had been parked at the time of the murder. \nMarcotte’s death came after 30-year-old Karina Vetrano, of Queens, was killed while jogging through Spring Creek Park in Howard Beach on Aug 2. \nShe was raped and strangled after trying to fight her attacker, authorities said. \nThe murders of both women drew stark similarities — two avid joggers, hundreds of police tips, and their killers remained at large. The Massachusetts State Police say the investigation remains active.

He is expected to be arraigned on murder and sexual assault charges . \nVetrano’s family and the NYPD pushed the state for familial DNA testing, which would provide partial matches with relatives. \nIt’s unclear if police are using familial DNA testing in Marcotte’s case.
