According to Entertainment Weekly , Ritter has announced that she’s working on her first novel, a psychological thriller called Bonfire . The book is about an environmental lawyer who returns to her hometown to investigate a company that has been dumping in chemicals in the water, and along the way she gets involved in the disappearance of someone who used to bully her in high school. All of this eventually leads to her uncovering “an even darker secret about the town,” which definitely doesn’t sound good. \nRitter says she’s “a huge fan of psychological suspense novels,” so she sees this as “an exciting opportunity” to get inside a character’s head and figure out their journey. Bonfire is schedule to be released on November 7. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:13:17.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
