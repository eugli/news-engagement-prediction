Millionaire ordered to pay his two sons more than £1.5m after killing their mother \nHe had been planning to travel onward to New York from Reykjavik in Iceland, but was taken off the aircraft by security forces while his class looked on. \n‘I was lost for words at the time and then it hit home when I saw that everyone was looking at me as if I had done something wrong and it made me feel really small,’ Mr Miah said. \n‘My colleagues on the plane and all my kids were looking at me, they were all gobsmacked and all upset. \n‘I don’t know what emotions I was going through but seeing their faces looking at me – it wasn’t nice.’ \nThe trip went ahead as planned but pupils and colleagues were left ‘shocked and distressed’ after Mr Miah was escorted from the aircraft.

PCSO pictured going the extra mile to help lost elderly lady \nIt is understood that Mr Miah was refused permission by the United States authorities to fly to New York, despite being issued with a valid visa for travel. \n‘I want to know why they kicked me off and would like them to say “Sorry we made a mistake”‘, he said. \n‘I wan’t an explanation and I’m not going to stop until I get one.’ \nHe tried to visit the US embassy in Iceland to find out why the decision was taken, but was denied access to the building,’ Neath Port Talbot council, which employs him, said. \n‘Understandably he feels belittled and upset at what appears to be an unjustified act of discrimination.’ \nDonald Trump signed an executive order, since suspended by a judge, which banned people from travelling to the US if they were from seven Muslim majority countries. \nMr Miah is from Britain and has family in Bangladesh, which is not one of the countries listed in the ban. \nA Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ‘We are providing support to a British man who was prevented from boarding a flight in Reykjavik.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:25:39.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
