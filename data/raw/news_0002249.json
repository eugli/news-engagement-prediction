Josh Peter , USA TODAY Sports 6:31 p.m. ET Feb. 3, 2017 CLOSE Share We rank the most devastating heartbreaking finishes in Super Bowl history.

(Photo: Ethan Miller, Getty Images) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nJimmy Vaccaro, the dean of Las Vegas oddsmakers, has been setting the point spread on Super Bowls for more than 35 years. So there seemed to be no better person to ask this simple question: What’s the best bet to make on the big game? \n“The one you win,’’ Vaccaro replied. \nOK, so we’re going to do additional research to help novice gamblers score big — or at least help them avoid losing the mortgage payment, the family car and the kid’s college fund — when the New England Patriots play the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday in Super Bowl LI. The first option for gamblers is to follow the principle of KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid). That would mean betting on what’s commonly known as “the point spread.’’ \nMORE SUPER BOWL LI COVERAGE: Super Bowl LI scouting report: Who has advantage, Falcons or Patriots? \nThe Patriots are listed by most oddsmakers as three-point favorites. That means if you bet on the Patriots, they must beat the Falcons by more than three points for you to collect.If you bet on the Falcons, they could lose by up to two points and you still would collect on your bet.(If the Patriots win by three points, the bet is considered “a push’’ and no one collects. Except in Las Vegas, where the sports book keeps what’s known as the “vig,’’ 10 percent of the wager.)The other straightforward way to bet the Super Bowl is to wager on the over/under, the total points scored. The over/under set by most oddsmakers for Super Bowl LI is 59, meaning you can either bet the two teams will score more than 59 points (the over) or bet the two teams will score less than 59 points (the under). \nPHOTOS: PATRIOTS, FALCONS PRACTICE FOR SUPER BOWL LI \nYou probably can’t bet on whether you’ll end up singing with Lady Gaga during the halftime show or accepting the Lombardi Trophy from Roger Goodell, but USA TODAY Sports will gladly give you 10-to-1 odds on either possibility — and fill you in on another wagering option: prop bets.
