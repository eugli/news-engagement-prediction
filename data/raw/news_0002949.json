Cherries skipper Simon Francis returned to the heart of the hosts' defence, whilst Benik Afobe was preferred to Callum Wilson as the lone striker. \n\nThe Eagles meanwhile were pleased to welcome back Wilfried Zaha from the Africa Cup of Nations. New signing Patrick Van Aanholt also came into the side to make his debut and lined up at left wing-back as Allardyce opted to trial a 3-4-3 formation. \n\n\n\n\n\nDespite their recent poor form, it was the visitors who made the brighter start to the match as the returning Zaha caused an early moment of panic for Bournemouth when his 20-yard effort cannoned off the base of Artur Boruc's post. \n\nThe home side continued to look uncomfortable for much of the early exchanges, particularly from set pieces, and it took until the 21st minute for Joshua King to have their first real effort on goal when his long range strike flew inches wide. \nPHOTOS: A few tackles flying in in the middle of the park! #BOUCRY pic.twitter.com/3y5CMXuair \n— Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC) January 31, 2017 \n\n\n\nThe rest of the first half was a fairly scrappy affair as both sides struggled to keep possession in the middle of the pitch. \n\nJunior Stanislas arguably had the Cherries' best chance but saw his left footed effort deflect narrowly wide, whilst at the other end, the lively Zaha forced a fine reaction save from Boruc, having somehow found space inside a crowded penalty area. \n \n\nThe first half of our @premierleague game against @CPFC in numbers... #BOUCRY pic.twitter.com/URCiUaDXCZ \n— AFC Bournemouth  (@afcbournemouth) January 31, 2017 \n\n\n\n​​After a relatively drab opening 45 minutes, the second half burst into life as the Eagles took the lead just moments after kick off. Jason Puncheon's cross from the left hand side was flicked into the path of Dann, via Damien Delaney's head, and the Palace skipper kept his cool to place the ball into the bottom corner.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuoyed by their goal, the away side pressed for a second and they would have found one had Van Aanholt not lost his composure when through on goal. \n\nThe Dutchman was nearly made to pay for his wastefulness when King headed onto the top of Wayne Hennessey's net as the game finally started to open up.\n \n\nNo way through at the moment... #BOUCRY pic.twitter.com/cl8F9MvfUr \n— AFC Bournemouth  (@afcbournemouth) January 31, 2017 \n\n\n\n\nEddie Howe made a number of changes just after the hour mark as his side went in search of the equaliser, however a resilient Palace defence only allowed their opponents shots from distance and were grateful that Francis was unable to convert a cross at the back post. \n\nThe game became fragmented as it reached the closing stages but in truth, despite their best efforts, Bournemouth failed to really test Hennessey until stoppage time when Jack Wilshere's low shot struck the post. \n\n\n\n\nWith time all but up, Francis' mistake allowed substitute Andros Townsend to run down the wing and cross for the unmarked Christian Benteke who powered home a header to finally end Palace's eight-match winless run in the Premier League, not to mention his own personal goal drought. \n\nWhilst the three points will come as a welcome relief to Allardyce and his men, they remain in the relegation zone after Swansea beat Southamtpon 2-1 at the Liberty stadium. For Bournemouth meanwhile, their poor form continues and Tuesday's defeat means they are still yet to win a match in 2017.\nTHAT'S IT! @afcbournemouth 0-2 Palace! A win, a clean sheet!
