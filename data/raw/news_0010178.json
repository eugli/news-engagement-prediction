See the components come together in the video above, and taste it for yourself at Tapalaya this Wednesday, February 8, and Monday, February 13. Each night, chef Anh Luu , a 2016 Eater Young Guns nominee , will give the usual menu of New Orleans small plates a break to unleash phorritos, crawfish etoufee nachos, and more. The phorrito is made by putting everything that’s in a bowl of pho inside a burrito. Luu braises beef brisket and uses the braising liquid to make a concentrated pho broth, or jus, flavored with star anise, cinnamon, fennel seed, coriander seed, fish sauce, and lime juice. Joining the brisket inside the burrito are rice noodles, fresh jalapeno, bean sprouts, Thai basil, hoisin, and sriracha. The jus is poured over and slightly absorbed by the noodles for a juicy, soup-like bite. The phorrito pop-ups are first come, first serve. The restaurant does take reservations for parties of five or more. Get them before they’re gone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:19:59.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
