The old cliché is the passionate, impulse-driven lifestyle, punctuated by love affairs and the odd ear lost in the process. \nInspired by this idea, photojournalist and writer Peter Dench has applied it to the lives of, in his opinion, the best British photographers working today. In his new book, Great Britons of Photography Volume 1: The Dench Dozen, Dench takes a Through the Keyhole-esque look at the people behind some of the most iconic pictures to come out of British photography in the past 50 years. \n“All of the photographers featured have shaped me in some way; sometimes professionally, most often personally,” explains Dench, over a croque monsieur in Tooting Bec. “They’re all good friends, this is how the book came together, it was quite organic.” Margaret Thatcher by portrait photographer Harry Borden, one of 12 artists featured in Dench's new book Credit: Harry Bordern/1996 - 98, AccuSoft Inc. \nT he result is a peek under the bed, and a rummage through the cupboards of some of Britain’s most remarkable photographic talent. Emerging names appear next to well-established figures, and their output is diverse and intriguing - the only thing linking them being their nationality. Portraits of pop-star Lily Allen are spliced with documentation of civil war in central Africa, and the UK's criminal underworld. \n“I understand that I live my life among extraordinary characters,” explains Dench. \"I wanted to acknowledge these people, and write down my friendships with them, so that when I’m an old man sitting in the corner of a pub, I can revisit the time we had together.” Anastasia Taylor-Lind Siberian Supermodels, Anastasia Taylor Lind Credit: Anastasia Taylor-Lind/Anastasia Taylor-Lind \nA nastasia Taylor-Lind is a British and Swedish documentary photographer, whose work focuses on issues relating to women, population and war. Her first book, Maiden: Portraits from the Black Square, documents the 2014 Ukrainian uprising in Kiev. The image above is taken from her 2013 series Siberian Super Models, a self-initiated reportage project that adheres to her interest in documenting women who live isolated from male society. The project started with a simple question - who are the most photographed people in the world? \nThe answer was the simultaneously ubiquitous and anonymous models that are plastered over magazines, bill boards and advertisements. Every year, a mass migration of beautiful young women head to Novosibirsk, the capital of Siberia, in the hope of eventually finding their fortune as an international model. “They want to experience the world, to have experiences and to live life in an exciting and engaging way,” explains Taylor-Lind. “Modelling is their ticket, much in the same way that photography offered me a way to live a life of adventure. I understand that desire to escape and experience the world.” Tom Stoddart A young gymnast practising her leaps at Wuhan School of Sport, China, 1993. Credit: Tom Stoddart /Tom Stoddart \n\"This photo hangs in my living room. It's possibly my favourite photograph ever,\" explains Dench, when I ask him about the image. Taken in 1993, it shows a young gymnast practicing her leaps at Wuhan School of Sport, China, where dozens of children with sporting potential stay away from their families. \n\"I just think it's spectacular, in terms of he's shooting with film, and it's just extraordinarily beautiful. Tom is a very sensitive soul, very affable, very kind - and I think that's reflected in this shot.\" \nT om Stoddart began his photographic career on a local newspaper in his native North East of England, before moving to London where he worked for publications including the Sunday Times and Time Magazine. He has documented countless international events, including the war in Lebanon, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the bloody siege of Sarajevo in the Nineties. \nOne of his most famous shots is of a beautifully dressed woman, head held high, walking through snipers' alley, past some armed guards during the Sarajevo conflict. \"He's always able to find the tender moments,\" muses Peter. \"Even in conflict zones.\" Chris Floyd Redhead. From the book Things May Change But This Will Stay The Same. Credit: Chris Floyd/Chris Floyd \n\"This photograph is about how it feels to fall in love,\" writes Chris Floyd, a photographer well known for his editorial portrait photography. \"This is love for the first time, shell shocked, stunned wonder that that thing, this person, has been put here in front of me, on Earth, in my lifetime.\" Floyd started his career assisting a jobbing photographer who was shooting head-shots for budding thespians, and his work has now appeared in some of the world's most established publications, and has been selected several times for the National Portrait Gallery 's annual portrait prize. \nT his image is from Floyd's 2011 book Things May Change, But This Will Stay the Same, a compilation of images taken ten years previously, documenting a love affair between the photographer and the unnamed red haired woman. The relationship began out of the ruins of 9/11 in New York, and then snaked aimlessly across America, via Amaretto bars and motel rooms. Inevitably, the aimless affair fizzled out, leaving only melancholic and meditative images. Peter Dench A man has his head shaved, South Beach, Miami, south Florida.

Credit: Peter Dench/Getty Images \nP eter Dench is best known for his highly saturated, snapshot-style photojournalistic observations of human behaviour – often with a focus on the British. From the Brits getting boozy abroad, to the Brits laughing ecstatically at car-boot sales, to the Brits getting drizzled on at Wimbledon, Dench has keenly recorded the nation's idiosyncrasies for over two decades. \nThis image captures a man having his head shaved on South Beach, Miami. Despite having published three books on Britishness, Dench is keen not to get pigeonholed. \"Including the America work was a deliberate attempt to show that I do photograph elsewhere, and take an interest in other places.\" Harry Borden The Spice Girls photographed at the beginning of their career. Credit: Harry Borden /Harry Borden \nH arry Borden is, without doubt, one of the UK's most accomplished portrait photographers. In 2005, he was awarded a solo exhibition at The National Portrait Gallery , and the gallery has over 100 of his works in their permanent collection. He's photographed everyone from Margaret Thatcher to Oscar Pistorius , and in 2014 he was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society. \n\"I'd known Harry for about ten or twelve years and the opinion I had of him was of a sweet and gentle portrait photographer,\" explains Dench. \"When I stayed with him in Devon, I was so flipped by discovering that he wasn't the person I thought he was - he's incredibly competitive. But I came away with a respect and understanding of him as an artist, and of portrait photographers and what they have to go through. They have vulnerabilities as well.\" Jocelyn Bain Hogg Mitch Pyle in a limo with friends on his birthday. This photograph is taken from Bain Hogg's book The Family. Credit: Jocelyn Bain Hogg. /Jocelyn Bain Hogg, VII Network. \nJ ocelyn Bain Hogg has been described as \"the anthropologist explorer of British society.\" He's the author of five books, which have focused on investigating the cult of celebrity, and infiltrating Britain's underworld of crime. This image is taken from his book The Family (2003), which offers an intimate look into Britain's organised crime world, a decade after his first book on the subject, The Firm (2011). Images of Charlie Kray 's funeral are interspersed with glamorous topless women and blurred boxers sparring in the ring, reminiscent of a Francis Bacon painting. \n\"I think the best way to describe him is as the Errol Flynn of the photography world,\" says Dench.\"He's always smartly dressed, with Trumper Extract of Lime to cool him down, and a handkerchief. It's not a caricature, that's genuinely who he is.\" Homer Sykes The Minehead Hobby Horse, Minehead, Somerset. May 1st, 1971. Credit: Homer Sykes/Homer Sykes \nH omer Sykes is a professional magazine and documentary photographer, with over 40 years of experience. He started out principally working for newspapers' colour weekend supplements in the Seventies and Eighties, which meant he travelled extensively as a conflict photographer in Israel, Lebanon and Northern Ireland . This image is taken form his book Once a Year: Some Traditional British Customs (1977), which was re-published in 2016. \nIt was shot at the break of dawn on May Day morning, in Minehead Somerset, in 1971, and shows the Minehead Hobbyhorse which traditionally walked from Minehead to Whitecross, a nearby village, where it bowed to the rising sun three times before heading back. A quiet, unassuming snapshot in a classic suburban street, it expresses a moment that's both curiously surreal and comfortingly familiar. John Bulmer Coalminers laugh at the end of their shift at Waldridge Colliery, County Durham, 1964. Credit: John Bulmer /John Bulmer \n\" John Bulmer is not a 'look at me' photographer, he's a 'look at this' photographer,\" says Dench, when discussing this adroit recorder of provincial Britain, and pioneer of colour photography in the Seventies. \nT his image was shot at Waldridge Colliery, County Durham in 1964. It shows a group of young coal miners, fresh from the pit, faces and hands smeared in coal, laughing with one another after a day's work. It featured alongside images of girls snacking in the street in their curlers, flat-capped men smoking in grey industrial streets, and cigarette stores packed with tobacco, in his seminal book The North (2012). Laura Pannack Saving the Cursed Children of Ghana, photographed for the Afrikids charity. Credit: Laura Pannack /Laura Pannack \nL aura Pannack' s work is marked out by a psychological intensity, and closeness to her subjects. Steadfast in taking her time, she believes that \"time, trust and understanding are the key to portraying subjects truthfully.\" Her remit focuses on social documentary and portraiture, and seeks to explore that complex relationship between the photographer and the subject. \nThe shot above is taken from her series Saving the Cursed Children of Ghana , which was a commission from the charity Afrikids . In remote parts of the country, some children, particularly those born with deformities, are thought to be possessed by evil spirits, and therefore sacrificed. As 70 per cent of the children don't have access to school, they end up working in illegal gold mines or quarries. Pannack's body of work with Afrikids aims tackle these issues. \nGreat Britons of Photography Vol. 1: The Dench Dozen, is published by Hungry Eye in association with Leica.
