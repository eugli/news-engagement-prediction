'We're taken aback by a government that made promises to get elected and have done anything but live up to them.' - Jerry Earle \n\"We're taken aback by a government that made promises to get elected and have done anything but live up to them.\" \nEarle says he hasn't seen the government create a single job since it took over. \n\"I'm not sure they have any true plan,\" he said. \"They talk about this document, The Way Forward. I'm not sure this is moving us forward. I think they're actually going to set this province back and leave an imprint for years to come on young people in this province.\" \nCuts have a ripple effect, said Earle, from small businesses to job hopefuls who may look out of province instead. Liberals had heads in sand on economy: Davis \nOpposition Leader Paul Davis also said the government was reneging on the premier's campaign promise to avoid job cuts, rejected Ball's assertion Wednesday that the Progressive Conservatives weren't honest about the province's financial situation before they lost power in late 2015. \n\"We were very clear in the state of the economy and what was happening in the economy,\" he said. \n\"If they couldn't see it, they're the only ones in the province who didn't understand how difficult a time we were headed for. If their heads were in the sand and not paying attention to the reality of what was going on in the world, then that's their misstep.\" \nNDP Leader Earle McCurdy also slammed the announcement Wednesday, calling it \"cuts for cuts' sake.\" \n\"It's a pretty grim day for a lot of Newfoundland and Labrador families who'll have to look long and hard at what their future involves.\" \nMcCurdy called the restructuring just a cover for the cuts. \n\"I don't see a plan for the economy of this province,\" he said. \"Last year's budget said unemployment is at 15 per cent, heading for 20. I've seen nothing since that would help that, and certainly having a bunch of layoffs in the public service sure doesn't help that.\" 17% cut would 'devastate' N.L.: union \nWhile the cuts announced Wednesday amounted to 17 per cent reduction of management positions, Earle said there's no indication from government that it will be seeking a similar slashing of unionized jobs during ongoing labour talks. \n\"That would devastate Newfoundland and Labrador,\" he said. \"That would devastate public services.\" \nEarle pointed to criticism of highway snowclearing this winter. \n\"That was because of a reduction in some services there, a minimal reduction but with a grave impact,\" he said. \"So you can imagine that in other areas if this government was going down that road.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:43:16.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
