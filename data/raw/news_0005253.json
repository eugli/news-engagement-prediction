(AP) — A Bremerton city councilwoman says she has no regrets about being arrested for shouting an obscenity during a confirmation hearing for President Donald Trump 's attorney general pick, U.S. Sen Jeff Sessions .\nPhoto: City Of Bremerton Website\nThe Kitsap Sun reports (https://goo.gl/ZEOuHV ) that Councilwoman Leslie Daugs was attending the hearing Tuesday when she shouted the obscenity in response to two Trump supporters who she said were \"high-fiving and fist-bumping\" while Republicans spoke highly of Sessions.\nIt's illegal to utter loud, threatening or abusive language or to engage in disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and police said they arrested Daugs for disruption of Congress. She was released about four hours later.\nDaugs told the newspaper she has no regrets about her remark or arrest. She says she's become more politically active since Trump became president, and that as a Filipino-American and a woman she feels her values are at risk.\n___\nInformation from: Kitsap Sun, http://www.kitsapsun.com /", "external_links": ["https://goo.gl/ZEOuHV", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/20/12301331/4/460x1240.jpg", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=1x4&iu=/36117602/hnp-beaumontenterprise.com/Video&ciu_szs=300x250,728x90&cust_params=video_player%3Dmediaos&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&url=%5Breferrer_url%5D&description_url=%5Bdescription_url%5D&correlator=%5Btimestamp"], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:15:55.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
