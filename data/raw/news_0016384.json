(The show's first four seasons, spanning 52 episodes, aired from 2001 to 2004, and it claimed four Primetime Emmys.) \nHero Jack, who's stopped aging, is still trapped in the dystopian future where the time-traveling warrior was thrust by the demon lord Aku. \n\"Aku's grasp chokes the past, present and future,\" the trailer reveals, and it looks like Jack will have a tough fight through the bleak, violent landscape. Still, he has hope, \"It always seems bad at first,\" Jack notes in the preview. \"But then, I find a way.\" \nThe new limited series will come to Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block on March 11. \nTech Enabled : CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility. \nTechnically Literate : Original works of short fiction with unique perspectives on tech, exclusively on CNET.
