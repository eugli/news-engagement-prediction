Most Popular By Luke O'Neil Feb 3, 2017 It's a confusing time for everyone right now, but in the lead up to the Super Bowl, that's particularly true for the Donald Trump-opposing New England Patriots fan. The reason for the conflicting emotions, as the burgeoning sub-genre of Tom Brady / Donald Trump opining that has sprung this week (including a piece I wrote today for for The Washington Post , and others in USA Today , The New York Times , Deadspin , and Sports Illustrated have touched on), is it's really very hard to square the friendship of Tom Brady—an exemplar of athletic prowess, and by all accounts a decent, charitable human being—with the odious, hateful rhetoric of Trump. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Instead of simply fretting about it, as many of us are doing, comedian Josh Gondelman , a writer for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver , and a friend, Emma Sandoe , came up with a rather ingenious workaround: For every score by the Patriots, he said, he'll donate money to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Think of it as a sort of carbon offsetting credit that makes your enjoyment of the game somewhat more guilt free. Most Popular Because of Tom Brady's garbage politics, I'm donating $100 for every Patriots TD and $50 for every FG to the @NAACP_LDF . #AGoodGame \n— Josh Gondelman (@joshgondelman) February 3, 2017 Since last night, dozens of others have made similar pledges, using the hashtag #AGoodGame, for a variety of causes, with Atlanta Falcons fans jumping on board as well.

So I will do this for every TD & field goal ATLANTA gets. https://t.co/WyQmM3FK0u \n— Mike Drucker (@MikeDrucker) February 3, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below I chatted with Goldelman about how being a lifelong Pats from Massachusetts fan feels right now, and his idea for the donation. ESQ: A lot of us have conflicted feelings right now. What's going on for you as a Pats fan? Josh Gondelman: I've been a fan of the team a long time, I guess over 20 years, and just the allegiance specifically of Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, and Robert Kraft seem to have to President Donald Trump... It's a little bit unnerving to me. Specifically, Belichick and Kraft's friendship seemed to solidify during the election with Belichick sending him a note the week before, and Kraft visiting Trump Tower the week after. Just like: \"Alright guys… This is not the time to become closer and more intimate friends with this person.\" Related Story How to Make Sense of This Bill Belichick Story I still can't get over the letter from Belichick . If you told me they were friends, they played golf, whatever, yeah, fine. But the letter… I still don't believe those are actually the words Belichick writes. Here's what I think. I think he wrote a note, Trump paraphrased it in his own language, and Belichick is too weird and private to have even corrected him. I think that's certainly a possibility. It just didn't seem like how I would imagine him writing. But you're probably right. He did say I sent him a note but he was never like Those are the words I wrote. This is a cool idea you and a friend came up with: #AGoodGame. It came from the idea of wanting to enjoy the football game but also reservations about the Patriots brass politics and the NFL in general. I want to watch, it's a nice excuse to visit my family—I live in New York—to see my parents and my sister. But I also feel weird carrying a banner for this team without doing anything to acknowledging it. Like, I have this large social media reach, and fortunately a little money I could donate to a good cause, so it just felt like to do that would be putting my money where my mouth is. Emma and I were talking about encouraging other people to it. Have you heard from a lot of people saying they're going to join on? Yeah, a lot of Patriots fans, and some Falcons fans going the other way with their scoring drives. And some football agnostic parties have been into it, which is nice. That's the idea. Otherwise I would've just donated, but to kind of make it a thing where other people can feel good about enjoying a sporting event. The financial gain that the NFL and New England Patriots reap from my turning on the TV is minimal, but I feel like I can surpass that. A few people are like, \"Why does it matter what an athlete thinks about politics!?\" But it's been mostly lovely. Tom Brady chats with Donald Trump ringside at Floyd Mayweather vs Arturo Gatti WBC Lightweight Title Fight, June 25, 2005 Getty Donna Connor Most Popular It does matter. I'm sure we've rooted for plenty of Republicans over the years. This feels different though. Yeah, it does. It feels different and it feels like how things have intensified and a lot of the actions that he's taken since he became president would be enough if you're just a casual friend and don't support someone politically, you can do something besides say I don't want to talk about politics. Not taking sides feels like taking sides. I almost feel like it's worse to be friends with him than to vote for him. I don't know if i can make a qualitative judgment better or worse, but he doesn't seem like the kind of person I would like to be friends with! What's coming up on Last Week Tonight ? It's a lot different of a political environment than last season. We're back a week from Sunday. I can't say too much about what's coming—I don't want to tell tales out of school—but I will say that I personally was looking forward, ideally, through most of last year, to not have to cover Donald Trump anymore. But certainly there will be pieces that focus on President Donald Trump. You would think it would easy to write jokes about Trump, but the absurd reality almost kind of neuters your ability to use absurdity right? I sometimes find that difficult to do. And it's also just I would rather the world be less bad and have to dig for jokes for subject matter than have everything be a night terror during the day, and just have to ring humor from that. What are you going to do if the Patriots put up 500 points? I don't know, man. I would rather that than they get shutout and I look like a real asshole.
