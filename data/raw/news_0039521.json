\nZLATAN WOULD BE A ‘DREAM SIGNING’ \nNapoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has admitted bringing Zlatan Ibrahimovic to the club would be his “dream signing”. \nThe 35-year-old, who scored his first Manchester United treble in the win over St Etienne , is on a one-year deal at Old Trafford with an option to extend it. \nHowever, he recently said “nothing is done” with his future. If he doesn’t renew a deal with United, then De Laurentiis will be ready to pounce. \n“My dream signing? I always try to go forward with what I have,” he said in an interview with journalist and former mayor of Rome, Walter Veltroni. Manchester United's Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

I had him as a dinner guest in Los Angeles and he’s incredibly nice, even though he always seems angry. \n“You know the one I’m talking about, right?” \nIbrahimovic’s representative, Mino Raiola, said last summer that the striker was keen on Napoli before he joined United. \nRaiola told Italian radio station CRC that Ibrahimovic said he wanted to make Napoli his last club after playing in a farewell match for former Juventus defender Ciro Ferrara.

Source: AFP \nHowever, if Wenger leaves then Arsenal reportedly face the prospect of losing their superstar Chilean, who scored the only Arsenal goal in the drubbing. \nJuventus and PSG are locked in a battle to sign Sanchez as he is yet to sign a new deal with 16 months remaining on his Gunners contract. \nThe attacker will likely miss Arsenal’s clash with Sutton in the FA Cup after he was given time off from the club to fly to Venice to visit a friend. \nLast month, Wenger said: “Alexis Sanchez is a committed player who wants to stay. I’m convinced we’ll find an agreement. It has to be in our potential. \n“I think no matter what happens we’ll try to keep them and we’ll go as high as we can and if we cannot go further, we cannot go further. That’s basically it.” Alexis Sanchez has been granted leave with the club's permission.

No. He is well schooled, and he has been in the job for 20 years,” said Doswell, whose team are currently 17th in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. Bayern Munich outgun Arsenal 1:12 \nDYBALA CLOSE TO NEW CONTRACT \nBarcelona and Real Madrid are set for a big blow with reported transfer target Paulo Dybala admitting he’s on the verge of signing a new deal with Juventus. \nThe striker signed a deal until 2020 when he joined Juve from Palermo in 2015, and though he hasn’t had as emphatic a season as he did last campaign, he’s reportedly about to sign a new deal. \n“We are very close to the renewal and there is very little missing,” Dybala told Sky Italia. \n“My agent will come to Italy to talk about the last things with [Giuseppe, Juve’s chief executive] Marotta, but the will is there on our part.” Juventus' Argentinian forward Paulo Dybala.

Source: AFP \n“He impressed me a lot that night, I know he also did Pep and it will be a player that he would have been following ever since. We have talked about him, it was not a performance you forget easily. \n“Technically he is the sort of player that Pep loves - his only problem has been injuries - and if it wasn’t for the issues he has had with injuries I am sure he would be one of the best midfield players in the world. \n“At the moment he seems to be doing well with his fitness - and if there is a chance to sign him in the summer - I am sure Pep will give it real consideration.” \n- Additional reporting with AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:51:12.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
