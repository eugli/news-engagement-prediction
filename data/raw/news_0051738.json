Sure, almost everyone from those countries happens to be Muslim, but that, according to White House senior advisor and walking racist \"Californians\" sketch Stephen Miller , is just a crazy coincidence. \nOf course, multiple federal courts dunked all over this specious-at-best reasoning and sent Miller and Rudy Giuliani and friends scurrying back to the drawing board, but it turns out that the federal judiciary is not alone in concluding that the administration has, as the Ninth Circuit put it, \"pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.\" The AP reports that the intelligence arm of the Department of Homeland Security—which, along with the Department of Justice, was responsible for implementing the executive order—doesn't quite buy the logic, either. \nAnalysts at the Homeland Security Department's intelligence arm found insufficient evidence that citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries included in President Donald Trump's travel ban pose a terror threat to the United States. \nA draft document obtained by The Associated Press concludes that citizenship is an \"unlikely indicator\" of terrorism threats to the United States and that few people from the countries Trump listed in his travel ban have carried out attacks or been involved in terrorism-related activities in the U.S. since Syria's civil war started in 2011. \nThe AP takes care to note that the memo is a draft, not a \"final comprehensive review of the government's intelligence.\" But even these tentative conclusions are a pretty bad look for the administration's increasingly fragile argument that the executive order was a well-reasoned, carefully-tailored tool that played a vital role in protecting national security. The DHS memo has the receipts, too: \n[O]f 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to carry out or try to carry out an attack in the United States, just over half were U.S. citizens born in the United States. The others were from 26 countries, led by Pakistan, Somalia, Bangladesh, Cuba, Ethiopia, Iraq and Uzbekistan. Of these, only Somalia and Iraq were among the seven nations included in the ban. \nOf the other five nations, one person each from Iran, Sudan and Yemen was also involved in those terrorism cases, but none from Syria. It did not say if any were Libyan. \nIn other words, Trump tried to mask his unconstitutional motives by conjuring a plausible rationale for the executive order that he hoped would pass constitutional muster—except his own subordinates believe that the excuse lacks foundation, too! Man, for someone who lies to the American people with such apparent cheerful regularity, this guy sure is bad at it. \nThe DHS memo's findings are important for reasons other than general hilarious ineptitude, though, since the White House is already hard at work at crafting a Muslim ban travel ban ban of some kind that might survive a legal challenge—and, this time, is intent on keeping its story straight. From CNN : \nPresident Donald Trump has assigned the Department of Homeland Security, working with the Justice Department, to help build the legal case for its temporary travel ban on individuals from seven countries, a senior White House official tells CNN. \nOther Trump administration sources tell CNN that this is an assignment that has caused concern among some administration intelligence officials, who see the White House charge as the politicization of intelligence—the notion of a conclusion in search of evidence to support it after being blocked by the courts. Still others in the intelligence community disagree with the conclusion and are finding their work disparaged by their own department. \nIt should go without saying that if Trump is instructing intelligence officials to cook the books in order to support his conclusion, instead of, you know, analyzing the data that those officials collect and making a policy decision on that basis , that's a five-alarm fire. Massaging data to support a president's prefabricated conclusion in this arena has historically gone very poorly . \nWhatever the intelligence agencies ultimately conclude, though, the fact that the intra-agency debate about preliminary conclusions has become so suddenly and startlingly public reveals a lot about President Trump's future attempts to test the limits of the law. While some intelligence officials are political appointees who will shill for the administration's positions no matter what, the civil servants who do the day-to-day work of these agencies won't necessarily feel the same way. Their role is professional, not partisan, and by leaking documents that show a lack of factual support for the administration's decisions, they see themselves as showing loyalty to their country, not to a disingenuous ideologue who has demonstrated no interest in hearing what his intelligence experts have to say. President Trump may be in charge, but not everyone in the executive branch, it seems, plans on putting up with the bullshit quietly.
