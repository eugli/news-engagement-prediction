Could   \nThe naked bodies of a mother and her teen daughter have been found buried in an abandoned house in Argentina. \nThe pair were found wrapped in bags and tied up with ropes in the town of Punta Lara, in the eastern Argentine province of Buenos Aires. \nThe victims were identified as Peruvian nationals Maruja Chacon Perez, 50, and Shirley Cielo Barrientos, 15. \nA short distance from the metre-deep (3-foot) hole the bodies were found in, police found the teen’s underwear and a bloody knife . \nPolice are investigating the cause of death and are hunting a suspect, Hugo Orlando Hidalgo, 40, believed to be the mother’s boyfriend.

On the recording, above the sound of a television in the background, his mother can be heard to say: \"Please, I do not want to die.\" \nIt was not clear whether the friend realised what was being said at the time. \nBarrientos believes that the murders of his mother and teen sister are related to human trafficking, as they might have died trying to protect themselves from being sold.
