I don’t go to moral victory speeches, I can’t stand them.” \nEmanuel said Democrats should stop arguing and nitpicking with each other in a circular firing squad, but also said they should understand that when it comes to responding to President Trump , “Not every pitch has to be swung at.” \nHowever, most key to him here is that Democrats need to be patient and accept that they probably won’t make their big comeback in the midterms: \n“It took us a long time to get this low. It ain’t gonna happen in 2018. Take a chill pill, man… You have to be part of this for the long haul.” \nYou can watch Emanuel’s remarks here . \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:09:41.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
