Right now, though, Amazon is having a sale on a handful of their Kindle-branded products where you can save up to $45 off select devices. For example, you can save $45 on the Kindle Voyage essentials bundle which comes with the 6-inch e-reader, a leather cover for it, and a 5W power adapter, bringing the price down to $234.97 from its original cost of $279.97. If an e-reader isn’t your thing and you’re looking for something that is more of a tablet, then right now you can pick up the Amazon Fire Tablet with a 7-inch display for just $39.99, which is a savings of $10 off the original cost of $49.99. \nIf you’re looking for something for the kids, then Amazon has you covered here too, as they’re currently selling the Fire Kids Edition tablet which comes with a 7-inch screen, 16GB of internal storage space, and a colorful kid-proof case to keep it protected from drops and dings, for just $79.99, which is a savings of $20 off the original cost of $99.99. There are also a number of other Kindles on sale too, so whether you’re looking for something to use as an escape into your favorite books, or a tablet that can do the same but also add the benefit of apps and games and other entertainment, there are a quite a few options available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:23:24.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
