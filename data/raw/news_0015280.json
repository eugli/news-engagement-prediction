He was also jailed for 22 years, to run concurrently, in July 2012 for 30 rapes against another victim. Burton and Burton are funded by the taxpayer via legal aid, with their fees reported to be £50 to £70 an hour, according to the Telegraph . Three other men convicted in the case, including Abdul Rauf (left) and Adil Khan (right), are also appealing against being stripped of their citizenship Justice McCloskey said: 'The conduct of these appeals has been cavalier and unprofessional. The rule of law has been weakened in consequence.' The judge also threatened the legal team with disciplinary action, warning them their actions could be in contempt of court. He added: 'Scarce judicial and administrative resources have been wasted in dealing with repeated unmeritorious requests by the Appellants’ solicitors for an adjournment.' Kabeer Hassan, 25, was sentenced to nine years for rape and conspiracy (left) while taxi driver Abdul Huk was found guilty of sexual activity with a child and was jailed for four years Taxi driver Rauf, 47, a father-of-five, was released on licence in 2015 after serving half of a six-year sentence for trafficking a girl, aged 15, in the UK for sex, and for having sex with the youngster himself. Rauf, who also acted as a religious studies teacher at a mosque in Rochdale, burst into tears, and through his Urdu interpreter asked the immigration tribunal for 'mercy' and that he 'wanted a second chance'. Ahmed, known as Daddy, previously took his case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) claiming that his all-white jury was biased – a breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, guaranteeing a fair trial. But judges in Strasbourg unanimously threw out his case, insisitng that there was 'simply no proof' jurors acted improperly. They dismissed the claim as 'manifestly ill-founded'. ROCHDALE SEX GANG CASE Twelve men were prosecuted for sex trafficking, rape, trafficking and engaging in sexual activity with a child. The abuse occurred between 2004 and 2009 and the men were sent to trial in 2012. Nine were convicted, of them eight were of British-Pakistani origin and one an Afghan asylum seeker. Three were not convicted. Shabir Ahmed, 63, was the ringleader of a child sex exploitation ring, grooming girls as young as 13 for sex in Rochdale and Bolton. He was given a 19-year sentence for conspiracy, two rapes, aiding and abetting rape, sexual assault and sex trafficking. Taxi driver Abdul Aziz, 41, was sentenced to nine years for conspiracy and nine years, concurrently, for trafficking for sexual exploitation. Kabeer Hassan, 25, was sentenced to nine years for rape and conspiracy. Taxi driver Abdul Huk was found guilty of sexual activity with a child and was jailed for four years. Freddy Kendukumana, was convicted of rape and sexual activity with a minor and jailed for eight and a half years.
