Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJurgen Klopp is convinced his big-money summer signing Georginio Wijnaldum is fast becoming the complete midfielder. \nThe Liverpool manager has transformed his Dutch international midfielder from a talented - if erratic - attacking threat, into an all-rounder who can take control of a game. \nWijnaldum ousted Emre Can from the Reds midfield for the game against Spurs a fortnight ago, and responded with a performance that his boss believes is the sign of a top class player in the making. \nAsked about axing Can for Wijnaldum, Klopp said: “It was not the easiest decision of my life because it was not too long ago that Emre was outstanding against Chelsea and in Hull.

He has been really good for us, and he has formed a good partnership with Jordan Henderson.
