But it also has its fans -- 63 percent of the Rotten Tomatoes audience liked it, and you couldn't get through Halloween without seeing a dozen Harley Quinn costumes. \nStill, the 2016 supervillain film was perhaps not the film many moviegoers expected to claim an early Oscar at Sunday night's Academy Awards. The film won best makeup and hairstyling, for the work of Christopher Allen Nelson, Giorgio Gregorini and Alessandro Bertolazzi. \nNaturally, Twitter users reacted -- some bringing up the DC-Marvel rivalry, and some specifically calling out how Marvel's \" Deadpool \" received no Oscar nominations. \nBut as some admitted, while \"Suicide Squad\" may not be a best picture contender, its makeup and hair game was pretty on point. So give Harley an extra pot of tea to classily swig in her jail cell, she's earned it. \nIt's Complicated : This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet? These stories get to the heart of the matter. \nBatteries Not Included : The CNET team reminds us why tech is cool.
