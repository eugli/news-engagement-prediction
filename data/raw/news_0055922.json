The President in November 2016 promised customers that he will retrieve and make payment in full to all customers. The president then candidate of the NPP said: \"I will investigate government's inability to pay the monies owned as well as investigate the DKM scandal and to ensure that there would be total restoration to all affected in both scandals\". However, the Finance Minister, Ken Ofori Atta appearing before the Appointments Committee was asked when payment would be made as promised but in his response, he said, it was not a manifesto promise for the payment of DKM customers. “I’m not privy to that promise, and I’m not sure the NPP has in its manifesto to settle all DKM customers”. He added, the party will through the Bank of Ghana will put stringent measures in place to check illegal Micro-finance companies operating in the country. But Koku Anyidoho says the NDC will pull the DKM money from Nana Addo’s nose. He chided the NPP for failing to deliver on the campaign promises as they planned to. He mentioned the energy sector levies, reduction in electricity tariffs, and payment of arrears for contractors among others. ‘’We shall not take any excuses from Nana Akufo-Addo…They shouldn’t hide behind any figures in failing to deliver. We are going to march them boot for boot…The NPP government should pay the victims of DKM as they promised. They made people believe that government was supposed to pay the victims. That was political dishonesty, wickedness and callous politics. We shall pull the money from their noses. They will pay. They must pay. The citizens of Ghana do not have time for him. He must fix the broken economy quickly because, we are not interested in excuses and complains. The dams must be constructed. The millions of jobs must be created…Ghana must become Heaven on Earth immediately.’’ In his view, the president is busy behaving like America’s president Donald Trump adding, the president is still in the campaign mood. Nana Addo has still not accepted that he is the president of Ghana and so, he was still promising when he delivered his first State of Nation Address, he said. Koku Anyidoho said we will start calling Nana Addo the ‘’lying President and call his Vice, the ‘’lying Vice President. We call them liars just like they called the former president incompetent.
