The Russian owner is obviously very impressed by what he has seen from the Italian so far. \nChelsea are currently top of the Premier League table, with an 8-point lead over second-placed Manchester City with 13 games left to play and Conte could win the league in his first season in charge. Both Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti managed that feat at Stamford Bridge, but neither was able to really stay at the club for the long haul.
