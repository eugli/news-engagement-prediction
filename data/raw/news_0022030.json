'Not good enough' \nCommittee chairman Meg Hillier said: \"Bill-payers deserve to know whether or not the energy schemes they fund represent good value for money.\" \n\"The government has failed to meet its commitment to report annually on the impact these policies are having on bills. Current arrangements just aren't good enough. \n\"Government must take action to address this and also ensure customers can see clearly what they are paying towards existing and future schemes through their bills,\" she added. \nThe BEIS said the government would respond to the PAC's recommendations \"in due course\". \nHowever, it said it took action last year to \" revise renewable energy subsidies to ensure customers are protected from higher energy bills\". \n\"The strong, decisive action we took reduced projected costs by over £500m to protect people's household budgets and ensure value for money while delivering more environmentally friendly energy,\" added a BEIS spokesperson.
