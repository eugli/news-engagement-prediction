It does not include white sugar, white flour or caffeine.\nBut what if he had one day to cheat on that diet? To eat anything?\nFood Network personality Guy Fieri knows what he would cook up for the Patriots’ quarterback.\n“With the calories that dude burns on an average day, he definitely needs a bacon mac-n-cheese burger,” Fieri said ahead of Super Bowl LI. “It’s all about the key quality ingredients, from the homemade mac-n-cheese to the garlic butter toasted bun.”\nAs a riff on the 80/20 ratio of Brady’s normal regimen, Fieri would go with an 80/20 Angus beef as the base for this offering. While the four-time Super Bowl champ may normally avoid eating some of the key ingredients involved, as he seeks to extend his NFL career as long as possible, perhaps a burger is just the way to tempt him.\nWhen Olympic gymnast Simone Biles asked the quarterback about his favorite splurge food in Houston this week, he told her it was a cheeseburger.\nMaybe after a win in Super Bowl LI, Brady will call on Fieri to help him kick it up a notch.", "external_links": ["https://www.yahoo.com/news/tom-brady-calls-simone-biles-160000629.html"], "published": "2017-02-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:48:56.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
