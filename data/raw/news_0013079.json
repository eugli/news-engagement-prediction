Source: Channel 7 \nThe other Australian attacks listed were the allegedly fatal stabbing by Smail Ayad of two backpackers at a Townsville hostel in August, 2016 , which police immediately said was not terrorism, the Minto knife attack on Wayne Greenhalgh allegedly carried out by Ihsas Khan in September last year and the knife attack on two police officers by Abdul Numan Haider who was shot dead in Melbourne in September 2014. Smail Ayad has been charged over the alleged murder of Mia Ayliffe-Chung in Townsville.   Police employee Curtis Cheng was shot dead outside the NSW Police Force’s Parramatta headquarters.   \nThe Lindt Siege and Cheng murders were covered extensively by the Daily Telegraph and also in the US. \nA NewsCorp spokeswoman said the company had not minimised coverage of terrorist attacks. \n“News Corp’s publications and websites covered the Australian events listed by the President with both professionalism and courage, and indeed called them out for the terrorism events that they were proven to be,” she said. \n“Coverage of terrorism issues in Australia by our journalists, cartoonist and commentators has been determined and fearless. \nThe excellence of our coverage has been recognised and celebrated by multiple journalism awards.” \nAlso on the list are the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, the Bastille Day attacks in Nice in 2015 and the co-ordinated terror attacks in Paris in November of the same year. \nThe White House said “most” on the list did not get sufficient media attention, although it did not explain how it defined the term. Some of the incidents on the list received widespread attention and deep reporting. \n“You’ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it’s happening. It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported,” Trump told a group of military leaders and troops during the visit. \n“And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that.” \nTrump, who has made relentless criticism of the media a hallmark of his presidency, did not explain why he thinks news outlets minimise attention on such attacks. \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer tried to tone down the president’s remarks, saying it was a question of balance: “Like a protest gets blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn’t necessarily get the same coverage.” The list includes incidents like the truck massacre in Nice, France, that killed dozens and received widespread attention, as well as less high-profile incidents in which nobody was killed. \nThe list appeared to be hastily assembled, including several misspellings of the word “attacker.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T14:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:17:13.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
