SWNS:South West News Service 6 This is the t-shirt which was on sale in Primark stores until a shopper made an official complaint \nThey have accused the budget retailer of making a “panicked” decision to ban the t-shirt after Methodist Minister Ian Lucraft wrote a scathing letter of complaint. \nHe told Primark boss Paul Merchant: “We were shocked when we came face to face with a new t-shirt with a racially explicit graphic and text.” \nNow Jasmine Williams has organised a petition to get the T-shirt back on Primark shelves. \nShe said: “The complainer called it”racist” despite the fact that those buying the shirt are buying it for the sake of the show as it is an officially licensed product. \n“The original Eeny Meeny Miny Moe song had the lyrics changed to ‘tiger’ over 40 years ago and only those older than this know the original. \nIf Eeny Meeny Miny Moe is so horribly racist maybe we should stop children singing it in playgrounds or I should get arrested for using it to choose which socks I’m wearing. Jasmine Williams petition organiser \n“Also, the man complaining is white. He is taking a mild-mannered shirt and taking it way out of context. \n“He is dictating what is and isn’t racist on behalf of a group of people, for which he has no right to speak on behalf of. \n“If Eeny Meeny Miny Moe is so horribly racist maybe we should stop children singing it in playgrounds or I should get arrested for using it to choose which socks I’m wearing. \n“I’m just shocked that a retail corporation could panic so much on the complaints of one ill minded customer speaking as if he himself is black.” \nSo far, 560 shoppers have objected to the withdrawal of the white garment featuring the motif Eeny Meeny Miny Moe over a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire. \nThe design was inspired by a scene where character Negan, the bullying leader of a groupof survivors of the Zombie outbreak, selects victims with the rhyme whileholding the club. \nTwitter user @AdamCJMcClean posted a picture of the t-shirt writing: “If you find this t shirt ‘racist’ you’re part of the problem.” \nGareth Puzy remarked: “@Primark why pull the t-shirt? “Fanatically racist”? Come off it! Someone needs to get off their soap box #WalkingDead @WalkingDead_AMC” \nPaul Eaton commented: “@Primark If the walking dead T-Shirt is racist then Jingle Bells is offensive as Batman told me he does not smell & Robin did not lay a egg” \nOn Facebook the decision was greeted with equal contempt with users branding the decision “f***ing pathetic”. \nJohn Hunter commented: “Ah imagine a time where people weren’t offended by Tshirts and baseball bats.” \nPrimark was been forced to remove “racist” t-shirts from its stores after shoppers complained about the phrase, “eeny meeny miny moe” used on The Walking Dead branded clothing. \nThe slogan used in the final episode of the sixth series of the American horror drama about zombies was written on a white men’s t-shirt with a picture of a bloodied baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire. \nShopper Ian Lucraft lodged a formal complaint about the “explicit” message after spotting it in a branch in Sheffield. \nHe said: “It was fantastically offensive and I can only assume that no-one in the process of ordering it knew what they were doing or were aware of its subliminal messages. \n“The slogan is “Eeeny meenie miny moe…..” \n“It stops there, but of course we all know what the original said: “catch a n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:22:13.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
