More by Chris Brennan Arrow icon \nPresident Trump’s “popularity is sinking like a rock” after just one month in office, according to a new Quinnipiac University Poll released Wednesday. \nA majority of the 1,323 registered voters in the national poll expressed doubt about Trump’s honesty, leadership skills, \"levelheadedness\" and ability to unite the country, according to Tim Malloy, the assistant director of the poll. \nThe media outlets that cover Trump don’t look to good to those voters as well. \nNinety percent of the voters said it is “very important” for the news media to “hold public officials accountable.” But 50 percent disapprove of how media outlets have covered Trump, compared to 45 percent who approve. \nStill, voters trust the media 52 percent to 37 percent “to tell the truth about important issues,” as compared to Trump. And 61 percent disapprove of the way Trump talks about the media. The new president has routinely labeled as “fake news” any reporting he does not like. \n“The media, so demonized by the Trump Administration, is actually a good deal more popular than President Trump,” Malloy said in a news release with the poll. \nA sampling of the poll’s findings: \n55 percent say Trump is not honest 55 percent say he does not have good leadership skills 53 percent say he does not care about average Americans 63 percent say he is not level-headed 60 percent say he does not share their values Conversely, 58 percent say he is intelligent and 64 consider him a strong person. \nThe poll was conducted from Feb. 16 to Feb. 20 and has a margin of error of +/- 2.7 percent.“This is a terrible survey one month in,” Malloy said.
