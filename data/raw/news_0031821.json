They dated for two years. \n“We are constantly on the phone. Plus, she comes back to Sungai Siput every weekend,” he said \nAlso getting hitched were Calvin Chong, 21, and Lim Poh Yi, 18, the youngest couple at yesterday’s event. \n“We met through a social networking application a year ago. \n“I fell in love with her when we met up after weeks of exchanging messages,” said Chong, a cook in Singapore. \nChong said he came from a single-parent family and wanted to get married early. \n“I want to have a happy family. \n“Our parents are also very supportive,”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:06:44.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
