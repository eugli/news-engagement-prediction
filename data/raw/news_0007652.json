She says the adults still require a translator to communicate.\nThis is one of the biggest challenges says de Queiroz. The group has been working on \"kinks in the transition\" for the past few months, on how to manage the upcoming year. They are holding meetings and talking to the community.\nDe Queiroz predicted last year it would be a two-year process to get the Aarafat family settled. The federal government provided income support for the first six months, while Yukon Cares was to cover the rest.\n'Also a proud moment for us' Still, there has been a lot of progress, especially with the Aarafat children, says de Queiroz.\n\"The children are thriving immensely,\" she said. \"It's great to have a conversation in English especially with the children.\"\nReem Aarafat, a Syrian refugee who came to Whitehorse in 2016, presents flowers to Kate Middleton upon the royal couple's arrival in Yukon in September.

Hassan, the oldest boy in the family, has started taking full-time classes at Yukon College to become a pharmacist. Ishmael, the second oldest, has been training as a barber. The children are now all fluent in English, says de Queiroz.\n\"I feel a little bit maternal. That the kids have grown up and you kind of have to let go. It's also a proud moment for us,\" de Quieroz said.\nThe group has submitted several applications to welcome more refugees to the Yukon, but de Queiroz says the process has been slow.\n\"The federal government has really slowed down,\" she said. \"We've had one of them for, I'd say, about four to six months, and we haven't even heard from the government yet, even to acknowledge that they received the application.\"\nDe Queiroz says she found U.S. President Donald Trump's travel ban this past weekend \"very discouraging\" but not surprising. She also took note of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's response on Twitter — and hopes he'll be held accountable.\nTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada\n— @JustinTrudeau \"Yeah, well I hope that those words translate into action on the ground, because sponsoring groups across Canada are seeing a lot of slowness,\" de Queiroz said.\nLatin Dance Fundraiser Yukon Cares is hosting a one year anniversary event this Saturday in Whitehorse, to raise money. The Latin Dance fundraiser is a 19+ event at Mount McIntyre Recreation Centre, and tickets will be available at Winterlong Brewing Co. and Midnight Sun Coffee Roasters.\nAll proceeds will go to Yukon Cares, and people are also able to donate online .\n3 members of Aarafat family 'extremely keen' to work: Yukon Cares Yukon College students, staff raise $20K for Syrian refugee with files from Sandi Coleman", "external_links": ["https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj5g92VpO3RAhUK04MKHeYODCUQFggaMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fyukoncares.ca%2F&usg=AFQjCNFtpDylj5dwo4H3XTHMFz9T3ozC0A&sig2=GkrV02Xw_Pbrt8Yo1sSW5A&bvm=bv.145822982,d.amc", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/WelcomeToCanada?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/825438460265762816"], "published": "2017-02-01T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:57:28.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
