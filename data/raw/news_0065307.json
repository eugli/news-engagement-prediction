Slot to Kentucky Links (Photo: Denny Medley, USA TODAY Sports) \nDespite winning its last five games, it's clear that Kentucky is not playing the kind of basketball it was earlier in the season when the Wildcats got off to a 17-2 start. \nAfter struggling to beat 7-20 Missouri, who is just 2-13 in league play, on the road Tuesday night, SEC Network analyst and former Wildcat Tony Delk suggested that John Calipari tinker with the UK lineup. \nGet the latest UK news sent straight to your inbox with out EMAIL NEWSLETTER \nDelk, who is the school's all-time leader in three-point field goals, says Kentucky needs more shooting on the floor in the form of Mychal Mulder . \n\"I like guys who can make shots from the outside. And that would be Mulder,\" Delk said. \"When Mulder comes in, it stretches the floor. You need driving lanes when you're a guard and you need shooters on the outside.\" \nOn his weekly call-in show Wednesday night, Calipari said he's more worried about the other end of the floor. \n\"People are worried about [making] shots. I'm worried about energy,\" Calipari said. \"If we're going to make this run, it's going to be with defense. It's got to be about energy.\" Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:25:01.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
