USA TODAY’s picks for book lovers include a debut novel that follows Abraham Lincoln as he makes a nighttime visit to his young son's grave. \nLincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders; Random House, 343 pp.; fiction \nLin-Manuel Miranda, what’s on your reading list? Lincoln in the Bardo , George Saunders’ exhilarating and theatrical novel about a grieving Abraham Lincoln, cries out for a stage adaptation. Who better than the creative genius behind Hamilton ? \nTold by a chorus of voices in a fast-paced, canto-like style, Bardo takes place on the February night in 1862 when the president has buried his favorite son, 11-year-old Willie, who died of typhoid fever. The setting: a cemetery not far from the White House, filled with restless souls stuck in limbo, a la Dante’s Inferno . \nOur three primary Dante-esque ghostly “guides” are Hans Vollman, felled by a beam before he could bed his much younger bride; Roger Bevins III, a young gay man who committed suicide; and the elderly and mysterious Rev. Everly Thomas. All, despite strange physical manifestations of their decaying states, are in denial and in no hurry to depart to the final great beyond. \nJoining them is a newcomer, young Willie. On this particular evening, a gaunt, shabby figure appears, sobbing; he goes to his son’s mausoleum, opens the coffin and embraces the boy he has lost. \nUSA TODAY says **** out of four stars. “Brilliantly imagined…my early bet for a showering of literary awards.” Lincoln's trippy visit to son's grave in brilliant 'Bardo' \nDarling, I'm Going to Charlie by Maryse Wolinski; Atria/37 Ink, 144 pp.; non-fiction \nA memoir by the widow of cartoonist Georges Wolinski, among those murdered in Paris in the 2015 terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo , the sacrilegious magazine. \nUSA TODAY says ***½ stars. “Poignant… clear-eyed.” 'Charlie Hebdo' widow writes defiant memoir \nWe’ll Always Have Casablanca by Noah Isenberg; Norton, 275 pp.; non-fiction \nIn honor of Casablanca ’s 75th anniversary, an account of the making of the 1942 Warner Bros. classic and why it has endured as “Hollywood’s most beloved movie,” as the subtitle puts it. \nUSA TODAY says **** stars. \"Lively.” Why we love 'Casablanca,' 75 years later \n4 3 2 1 by Paul Auster; Henry Holt, 866 pp.; fiction \nThis novel takes the life of one man, Archie Ferguson, born in 1947, and offers four alternative versions. \nUSA TODAY says *** stars. “Give Auster full points for literary moxie… 4 3 2 1 must be applauded for its ambition.” One man, four lives, in Auster's '4 3 2 1' \nStolen Beauty by Laurie Lico Albanese; Atria, 320 pp.; fiction \nHistorical novel alternates between painter Gustav Klimt and his muse, Adele Bloch-Bauer, better known as the “Woman in Gold,” and Adele’s niece, Maria Altmann, during World War II. \nUSA TODAY says *** stars. “Artfully weaves Adele’s story with Maria’s harrowing life under the Nazis.” \nContributing reviewers: Jocelyn McClurg, Ray Locker, Bill Desowitz, Eliot Schrefer, Patty Rhule CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ltyq0H NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
