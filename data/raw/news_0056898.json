Ranieri was sacked just months after lifting the Premier League trophy (Photo: Michael Regan) \nIt was there that Ranieri was allegedly told by director of football Jon Rudkin that he was being removed from his position. \nRanieri is ready to receive a £3million pay-off after being axed just six months into a new four-year contract. \nThe sacking comes nine months after the Italian defied 5000/1 odds to guide the Foxes to a shock title success. \nRanieri was rewarded with a bumper new double-your-money deal in August that earned him £3m-a-year, and Mirror Sport understands the 65-year-old is in line to receive 12 months' money as part of his severance package.

After the euphoria of last season and being crowned Premier League Champions all I dreamt of was staying with Leicester City, the Club I love, for always. Sadly this was not to be. \n“I wish to thank my wife Rosanna and all my family for their never ending support during my time at Leicester. My thanks go to Paolo and Andrea who accompanied me on this wonderful journey. \n“Mostly I have to thank Leicester City Football Club. The adventure was amazing and will live with me forever. Thank you to all the journalists and the media who came with us and enjoyed reporting on the greatest story in football.
