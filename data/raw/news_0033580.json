(Reuters Photo) \nPollution in New Delhi in November reached crisis levels, with crop burning, car exhaust, dust and coal plants blamed for the record smog. \nThe government shuttered schools and temporarily closed a coal-fired power plant as a stop gap, but experts say the energy-hungry nation will need to do more if it’s to clean the air for India’s 1.25 billion people.

Coal-based pollution in the environment will always be very significant in India,” Sumant Sinha, chairman of Indian clean energy firm ReNew Power said. “Renewables are not going to be expanding fast enough for us to be able to impact that particular problem. Unless all of those (factors) are also brought under control, I don’t think it’s going to come anywhere close to really solving the problem.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:35:59.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
