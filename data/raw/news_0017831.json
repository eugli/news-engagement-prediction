This is the second time that a dead cat was found in the same location, said the group.\nHours later, it posted a photo of another cat found behind Khoo Teck Puat Hospital with its stomach slit open, adding that Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) caregivers were at the scene.\nThe cat found with its stomach cut open. (Photo: Yishun 326 Tabby Cat)\n“We plead all to keep a lookout for suspicious persons in the neighbourhood,” the animal rescue group wrote.\nResponding to queries from Channel NewsAsia, AVA said it has collected the carcasses of both cats for investigations.\n“Members of the public who have information on these cases (such as photographic or video evidence, witnesses) can contact AVA at 1800-476-1600,” a spokesperson said. “All information provided will be kept in strict confidence.”\nYishun has seen a spate of cat abuse cases, which prompted Member of Parliament Louis Ng to beef up a grassroots response team to gather evidence and conduct patrols in the neighbourhood.\nLast June, 41-year-old Lee Wai Leong became the first person to be convicted and sentenced under enhanced animal cruelty laws for throwing a cat 13 storeys to its death. Lee, who suffers from moderate intellectual disability, was sentenced to 18 months’ probation.\n- CNA/xk\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2017-02-10T03:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:16:47.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
