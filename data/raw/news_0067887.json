Nine Iraqi migrants are on trial (Picture: CEN) \nIt is claimed that the victim began to feel sick, so was taken back to a flat. \nMost of the men deny the charges, however DNA from six of them was found either in or on her body. \nAccording to MailOnline , the defendants, aged between 22 and 45, all arrived in Austria between May and December 2015. Teenagers filmed struggling in frozen lake after falling through ice taking a selfie \nFive of them had cemented their right to stay, however the applications for the other four were still pending. \nThe victim said after being taken back to the flat, she found herself naked in a bed and being assaulted by the men, one after the other. \nAfter the alleged attack, which went on for a number of hours, the victim needed in-patient treatment at a trauma clinic. \nShe is now under psychiatric care for post traumatic stress disorder. \nOnly one of the nine men, Mohamed Al-A., 31, admitted his role in the alleged rape. \nIn court, he cried and stated he was ‘really drunk’ when it happened. The police were called to the scene after the alleged attack (Picture: CEN) \nHe is one of four men, along with Nazar Al-J., Mohammed Al-T. and Alaa Al-J., who allegedly took the victim back to the flat. \nOther defendants – Hader Al-A., Mustafa Al-J., Nael Al-J., Marwan Al-J. and Sabah Al-J. were said to be at the flat waiting. Care nurse charged for forcibly lap-dancing on 100-year-old man \nDoctors stated that the victim was raped several times. \nShe had reportedly shouted in German: ‘No, I don’t want this.’ Then in English: ‘Listen to me, just a little bit.’ \nAfter calling the police, a tracking app on the victim’s phone reportedly led officers to the scene. \nThe trial continues today.
