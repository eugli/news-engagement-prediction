On February 2, a part of the C Block building near the popular Jain Book Depot collapsed. \nThe NDMC shut down the rooftop sections of 21 open-air restaurants after the incident at C Block. \nThere are 156 shops and 74 residential spaces in Khan Market, which was set up as a neighbourhood market in 1950 and is now one of the most expensive commercial spaces in the world. \nOf the 74 residential spaces on the first and second floors, 44 are engaging in commercial activities housing 30 restaurants, while another 10 eateries are located on the ground floor.

If you keep loading indiscriminately, then it becomes unsafe. \n“Be it Connaught Place or Khan Market. Any construction, especially one which is more than 50 years old, with time it’s loading capacity decreases. If you keep adding floors to these and put generators, water tanks and mobile towers, they will become vulnerable. Safety is largely influenced by loading characteristics,” Mishra told HT. \nKhan Market was initially meant for shops on the ground floor and residential flats on the first floor. In 2000, residential flats on the first floor were converted into commercial complexes. In the past few years, most restaurants have come up on the first and above floors. \n“These were meant for four people. Instead, if there are 40 people, the load gets multiplied. There is an inadequacy in the law regarding the number of persons these establishments can cater to,” the fire chief said. \nRestaurants that have a seating capacity of more than 50 need necessary clearances from the fire department. However, those with a seating capacity of less than 50 need no such nod from the fire personnel. \n“Most restaurants at Khan Market have got their licenses showing a seating arrangement of 48 people and thereby are out of the ambit of the fire department’s jurisdiction. The law needs to be revisited. Criteria for determining the number of seats should be made methodically, rather than leaving it up to the restaurants,” Mishra said.

This is being done in compliance with high court orders. Inspections are also being done to check unapproved constructions,” a senior NDMC official said. \nIn its order in October, the high court directed the NDMC and the Delhi Fire Service to decide within two months whether the first-floor flats that can cater to more than 50 persons qualify as “assembly building” and, if yes, whether these eateries satisfied all requirements, including fire safety norms. \n“NDMC cannot on the one hand assume the power to grant licence for using the premises as a restaurant/eatery and on the other hand absolve itself of responsibility to satisfy itself that restaurant does not pose a fire hazard to the safety of those patronising the same and that in the event of fire, proper measures for evacuation of the patrons therein and to prevent the fire from spreading to the entire market, exist,” the court had said.

There is no provision for fire exits, too,” an official said. \nThe Khan Market Traders association had in 2013 moved Delhi high court against NDMC for allegedly not having implemented the redevelopment plan, which included a fire emergency plan, thereby putting lives of traders, shoppers and visitors at risk. \nA team from IIT-Roorkee conducted a survey on the structural safety of the market almost 2 years ago as part of the Khan Market redevelopment project. The revamp proposal, however, is stuck. \n“We are scared. Khan Market is in a similar situation, too. Every year, the foundation of these buildings gets weaker and the load has increased manifold posing a grave danger to these structures. \n“Experts from IIT-Roorkee were hired by New Delhi Municipal Council two years back for advice on retrofitting of the old structures of this market established in 1950. However, we are yet to see any real action,” Khan Market traders’ association president Sanjeev Mehra said. \nBox \nThere are 156 shops and 74 residential spaces in Khan Market \nKhan Market was set up as a neighbourhood market in 1950 \nIt is one of the most expensive commercial spaces in the world \nOf the 74 residential spaces on the first and second floors, 44 engage in commercial activities house 30 restaurants. \nAnother 10 eateries are located on the ground floor \nKhan Market was initially meant for shops on the ground floor and residential flats on the first floor \nIn 2000, residential flats on the first floor were converted into commercial complexes \nIn the past few years, most restaurants have come up on the first and above floors \nFire officials say Khan Market has over the years become so congested that reaching there in the time of emergency is also a problem \nThe Khan Market Traders association had in 2013 moved Delhi high court against NDMC for allegedly not having implemented the redevelopment plan, which included a fire emergency plan, thereby putting lives of traders, shoppers and visitors at risk tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:33:17.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
