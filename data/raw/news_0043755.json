Mandy Masters hit headlines worldwide in 1962 at the height of the thalidomide scandal when a photo of her as a nine-month-old tot became an iconic symbol of the disaster. Critics told the 55-year-old's mother she should have had her daughter 'put down' - but Mandy adapted to her disability by using her highly-dexterous toes as fingers and worked as a telephonist, hairdresser and beautician - writing, applying makeup and even cutting hair with her feet. The married grandmother-of-seven, from Grays, Essex, is now a medium and claims she can channel the spirits of dead relatives by putting her feet on other people's foreheads to channel their spirits. Mandy Masters, a medium who became the 'face of thalidomide' when she was born with no arms, claims she can communicate with dead relatives using her feet Mandy hit headlines in 1962 at the height of the thalidomide scandal whena photo of her as a nine-month-old tot became an iconic symbol of the disaster Thalidomide was originally prescribed as a 'wonder drug' for morning sickness, headaches, coughs, insomnia and colds. Thalidomide babies often suffered missing or deformed limbs and extreme shortening of arms and legs, but the drug also caused malformations of the eyes and ears, genitals, heart, kidneys and digestive system. Mandy, who believes she was the UK's first thalidomide baby to become a grandparent, said: 'I am just an ordinary Essex girl who happened to be born without arms and is able to connect with the above. 'I have always used my feet as hands, and all my life I have worked very hard to become very successful in spite of my disability,' says Mandy. 'From a young age I always felt different, and when I was 14 and having a hard time and I went to Lourdes and bathed in the water. 'The next day, spirits started communicating with me. At first I thought I was going crazy, but my mum told me they wouldn't hurt me. 'Spirits were approaching me all the time, but sometimes I didn't want to hear it - all I wanted to do in life was find a husband and have children.' Mandy holding the newspaper cutting from the Sunday Pictorial Mandy said: 'I am just an ordinary Essex girl who happened to be born without arms and is able to connect with the above'. She added: 'There will always be sceptics, but to see me in action - it is just unbelievable. First I ask the person to relax, then I put my feet around their head' Thalidomide was marketed as a mild sleeping pill safe for pregnant women - but caused thousands of babies worldwide to be born with malformed limbs. Mandy believes she has achieved most things in life that she wants to despite this Mandy focused her attention on raising a family, and it was only later that she concentrated on psychic readings. 'After I'd married and brought my children up I rediscovered my abilities and have now been doing what I do for more than 22 years. 'My feet are my hands, so it made sense to use my feet to do body reads. I'm the only person in the world who does this in this way. 'There will always be sceptics, but to see me in action - it is just unbelievable. First I ask the person to relax, then I put my feet around their head. 'I go into a meditative trance and I am able to tell them things about their loved one that I couldn't possibly know - things they had spoken about or done together. 'When I contact the spirit world my voice changes and I am able to speak to them as their relative or loved one, in their voice. No other person in the world is doing this.' Thalidomide was marketed as a mild sleeping pill safe for pregnant women - but caused thousands of babies worldwide to be born with malformed limbs. The apparently-harmless drug, which also reduced morning sickness, was first licensed in July 1956 and the first links to birth defects were made in 1961. Mandy's mum June Hornsby, who died last month aged 79, was prescribed thalidomide during her pregnancy because she was struggling to sleep. 'When I was born without arms and hands doctors told my mum they could take me away so she could have a normal life,' Mandy says. 'As a baby my photograph went round the world and I became famous - it was even used in a history book - but my parents received hate mail telling them they should have had me put down. The mother-of-two, who has been married to husband Wayne for 36 years, can also drive, type and hold utensils using her toes. The couple are pictured, left and right, on their wedding day Before Mandy became a medium, she worked as a telephonist answering phones and taking notes in an office and then turned her hand to being a hairdresser and beautician The mother-of-six had no idea there was anything wrong with her daughter throughout her pregnancy and only discovered Mandy's disability when she was born on September 20, 1961. The following July, when Mandy was nine months old, she became world famous when a black and white image of her was used on the front page of the Sunday Pictorial newspaper. Before Mandy became a medium, she worked as a telephonist answering phones and taking notes in an office and then turned her hand to being a hairdresser and beautician. The mother-of-two, who has been married to husband Wayne for 36 years, can also drive, type and hold utensils using her toes. Mandy, as a child, who has an eighth grandchild on the way, also believes she was the first thalidomide baby to become a grandmother Mandy said if the doctors who told her mum to give her away were alive today, she would 'stick her fingers up at them if she had them' As well as carry out her customary body reads, she also deals tarot cards and reads crystals using her feet. Mandy realised how far she had come earlier this month when a friend chanced upon a copy of the front page article she featured in at a recent auction, buying it for Â£50. And the grandmother, who longs to be a Loose Women guest star, said adapting to life without hands as a baby set her up to make the most out of her life. Mandy, who has an eighth grandchild on the way, also believes she was the first thalidomide baby to become a grandmother after the birth of her grandson Callum in 1997. Mandy says that spirits started communicating with her as a child and at first she thought she was going crazy The 55-year-old said: 'When my mum was pregnant with me she felt like something was wrong, but until I was born my parents had no idea of my disability. The risks of thalidomide just weren't known. 'If the doctors who told my mum to give me away were alive today, I always say if I had fingers I would stick my fingers up at them. 'I wouldn't change who I am for the world. I have always wanted to prove I could make something of my life and have done everything I want to do - except for appear on Loose Women. 'As I grew up when it came to what I would do for work I worked in an office typing and answering the phones. My handwriting is beautiful, and I can use my feet to hold utensils too. 'I also worked as a beautician and hairdresser, doing makeup and cutting hair. I had always done my own, so it made sense to do it for everyone else too, and no one could tell I was using my feet instead of my hands - everyone was quite amazed. 'When my friend discovered the front page I couldn't believe it to see the picture after all that time - and the picture was me. I think it was a sign to show me how far I have come.' Mandy added: 'I wouldn't change who I am for the world. I have always wanted to prove I could make something of my life and have done everything I want to do - except for appear on Loose Women' THALIDOMIDE SCANDAL TIMELINE 1953: Drug created in Germany by the Gruenenthal Group. 1958: Thalidomide is first licensed for use in the UK. 1961: Australian doctor William McBride reports an increase in deformed babies being born at his hospital to mothers who had taken thalidomide.
