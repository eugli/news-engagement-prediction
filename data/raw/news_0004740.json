In fact, they have won just one match out of nine in the attacker's absence and that was against Plymouth in the FA Cup. \nThe Senegalese international will bring a breath of fresh air back to the Liverpool team and will no doubt spark the Reds into life as they look to make a positive start to February. His goals could just clinch Liverpool the league! 2) They have had their blip via \nEvery team will go through a bad spell this season. In years gone by, even the eventual title winners suffer from a brief loss of form at some point in the season. It's fair to say that Liverpool have had theirs but they looked back to their best at times against Chelsea on Tuesday. \nThe Blues are yet to enter their 'blip' and face tricky games away at Manchester United and Everton in their final run-in. Their loss of form could prove to be Liverpool's gain! 3) 10 point gap? It's been done before! via \nYes, a ten-point gap may be difficult to overcome but it's been done before! In fact, back in 1998, Arsenal won the league despite being 11 points behind leaders Manchester United at one stage. \nAlthough they did have games in hand, the Gunners overturned the gap in just nine matches thanks to a fine run of form and a crucial victory away at Old Trafford near the end of the season. 4) No cup or European distractions via \nUnlike their title competitors, Liverpool have only the Premier League to focus on from now until the end of the season. Following cup exits to Wolves and Southampton and no European commitments, the Reds can fully focus on league matches. \nChelsea are still in the FA Cup and could play up to six more games if they reach the final! Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal and Manchester City also have European fixtures to play meaning tiredness and injuries could well count against them!
