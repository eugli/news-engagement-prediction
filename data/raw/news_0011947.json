Brooklyn Beckham posted this cute snap of Becks cuddling Harper (Photo: Instagram/brooklynbeckham) \nHackers initially approached Portugal-based Doyen Sports, part of Oliveira’s firm Doyen Global. Beckham’s business team resisted the blackmail and called in police early last year, the Mirror can reveal. \nA source said: “They approached by email and attempted to meet via another third party. They said we have all this information and you have to pay up. It was blackmail, pure and simple.

As I told you, I am a man of my word, and as well as stopping all publications I decided to delete all the documents from the site to prevent any kind of speculation.

The perpetrators have targeted a number of business connected to the football world. \nAfter the hackers’ attempt to extort money failed, the bombshell information was passed to the Football Leaks website. Football Leaks have denied blackmailing Doyen Sports.

F***ing joke.” \nBlasting the honours committee, Becks – awarded an OBE in 2003 – said: “I expected nothing less. It’s a disgrace to be honest and if I was American I would of got something like this 10 years ago.” Read More David Beckham reveals regrets over four-letter rant: 'Yes I sent emails but in the heat of the moment' \nIn another leaked email he appears to refuse to give $1million to an event run by the Unicef children’s charity, allegedly saying “it’s my f***ing money”. \nBut a friend said: “It was very much in the heat of the moment and then you move on. David just had a vent and that was it. \n“Some of the emails were doctored to make them sound worse . For instance he never said the word f . It just would be an awful shame if this detracts from the amazing work he does with Unicef.” \nBeckham was also said to have demanded Unicef pay £6,685 for a business class flight to visit children affected by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines – despite his sponsors paying for a private jet.

He has donated over £1.5million, raised millions in the last two years. He has led campaigns, done charity games at Old Trafford. And because of a couple of old emails, people are lambasting him for it.” \nBeckham’s Unicef 7 fund has raised over £4.3million since launch in 2015. Over £500,000 has been sent to train teachers and fund schools in Bangladesh. Another £800,000 has helped disabled kids in central and Eastern Europe.

But a spokesman said: “This story is based on outdated material taken out of context from hacked and doctored private emails from a third-party server and gives a deliberately inaccurate picture. \n“David Beckham and Unicef have had a powerful partnership in support of children for over 15 years. The David Beckham 7 Fund has raised millions of pounds and helped millions of vulnerable children around the world. He’s given significant time and energy and made personal financial donations to the 7 Fund and this commitment will continue long-term.

David and Unicef are rightly proud of what they have and will continue to achieve together.” \nUnicef said it is “extremely proud” of its work with Beckham. It said in a statement: “As well as generously giving his time, energy and support to help raise awareness and funds for Unicef’s work for children, David has given significant funds personally.” It's lunacy that he has not been knighted: By Peter Willis, founder of the Pride of Britain \nThe suggestion that David Beckham supports charities in desperation to gain a knighthood is as ludicrous as him still being denied one. \nFor the past two decades, I have, as the founder of the Mirror’s Pride of Britain Awards, seen first hand his enthusiastic commitment to supporting young people and children’s organisations. \nSince 1999, he’s given up time every year to film surprises with our astonished young winners, chatted with them after the cameras stopped and been genuinely interested in their incredible achievements. \nNo other British footballer has been so hugely popular for so long and few have been so ready to support good causes or so reliable. \nMany A-listers agree to present an award at Pride of Britain on condition they can leave straight after the handover but, when David last attended in 2015, he wanted to stay the whole night and happily agreed to endless selfies. \nI share his frustration that he was snubbed for a knighthood in 2013. It must have been humiliating as the media had widely predicted he would be recognised for helping to bring the Olympics to London. How shameful that a Whitehall mandarin blocked a plan to make him a Sir. Especially when the civil service showers its colleagues with honours every year. \nThe honours committee is shrouded in such ridiculous secrecy we aren’t officially allowed to know who takes part in the decision-making, let alone what’s discussed. \nIf David was snubbed over his tax affairs, what a joke. He’s surely more deserving than rich donors to political parties or the odious “Sir” Phillip Green whose wife banks his billions offshore in Monaco (rather than help out the BHS pensioners). \nDavid Beckham is, without question, one of Britain’s greatest ambassadors on the world stage.
