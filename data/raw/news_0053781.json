(Stacy Revere / Getty Images) Privacy Policy \nVic Law might just have the last laugh after all. \nWhen he announced during the summer leading into his senior season at St. Rita that he was going to attend Northwestern , more than a few critics questioned his sanity. \nSkeptics correctly pointed out the Northwestern men's basketball program had no history or tradition to celebrate and mostly resided at the bottom of the Big Ten standings. \nSo why would Law, a wildly athletic and versatile 6-foot-7 swingman, choose Northwestern over a host of other more established programs, such as Stanford and Vanderbilt? \nHe had his reasons. \nMuch had to do with Chris Collins, the Wildcats' new coach. \n\"Coach Collins talked about building a program and what this team could one day achieve if I came aboard,\" Law said. \"There was a lot of pride when I talked to him and the assistant coaches about Northwestern. They were genuine. They had a vision. I had faith in them.\" \nLaw's faith has been rewarded. \nThe Wildcats (20-7) are on the verge of making history, becoming the first Northwestern team to earn an invite to the NCAA Tournament. \nIt's not a done deal yet. The Wildcats can enhance their chances with games remaining against Indiana, Michigan and Purdue . \nBut many college basketball experts have Northwestern as one of 68 teams to receive an invite to March Madness. \nLaw isn't taking anything for granted. But he acknowledged during our interview Monday in Evanston how gratifying it would be to be a part of the tourney. \n\"It would be special,\" Law said. \"People gave me some backlash for choosing Northwestern. But it's all coming together.\" \nCollins confirmed getting a talent such as Law, who was ranked among the top 100 prospects by 247sports.com, to commit to Northwestern set the wheels of success in motion. \n\"When I got the job, everybody said, 'You better get to St. Rita,'\" Collins said. \"My first day on the job, I was at St. Rita. I knew Vic was the guy we needed to get. He's big, athletic, a good student and he comes from a great family. \n\"He believed in me when I had a dream and a vision for this program. I'm indebted to him.\" \nLaw has held up his end of the bargain. He's helped the Wildcats notch a program record-tying 20 wins this season while averaging 13.3 points, 5.4 rebounds and 1.5 assists. \nHe did, however, have to overcome adversity After a promising freshmen season, Law missed his sophomore season after tearing his left labrum. \nIt was a huge blow for Northwestern, which had its sights set on earning a bid to the NCAA Tournament. \nLaw, a South Holland resident, was obviously disappointed he sustained the injury. He had prepared to take the next step in his development. \nLooking back, however, the redshirt sophomore believes being sidelined might have been the best thing to happen to him. \n\"It was a blessing in disguise,\" Law said. \"Sitting out made me realize that you can lose it all. It made me have a greater appreciation for what I do. It made me get excited to get back out and play.\" \nCollins noticed a difference in his prized recruit. \n\"Of course, losing him was a huge blow to us,\" Collins said. \"But it was a blessing for him to sit back and watch. The old saying of, 'You don't know what you got until it's gone.' I saw a guy who was hungrier and more determined when he got back.\" \nNot only determined to show critics he made the right choice in becoming a Wildcat, but in helping this program get to where it's never gone before. \n\"I'm definitely not surprised at the success we're having,\" Law said. \"I knew we could be good. That's one of the reasons I chose Northwestern.\" \nIt's proved to be a wise choice. \nTwitter @disabato", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:26:06.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
