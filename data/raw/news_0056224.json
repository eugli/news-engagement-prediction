When the outcast’s mother dies under mysterious circumstances, he tries to prove she was murdered. \nPally and Bloom will produce, along with Petra Ahmann. Gregor and Mand are executive producers. \nLionsgate made the acquisition through its digital studio, which had made first-look deals with digital influencers, such as Grace Helbig and Hannah Hart, and produced the film “Dirty 30” and the Hulu series “Dimension 404.” \nBloom’s “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” was recently renewed for a third season. She won a Golden Globe this year for best actress in a TV series, comedy or musical. Pally’s credits include “Happy Endings” and “The Mindy Project.” \nBloom and Pally are repped by UTA and 3 Arts. Gregor is repped by CAA and Kaplan/Perrone. The news was first reported by Deadline Hollywood.
