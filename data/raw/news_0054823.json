The first matches soil found near the Avondale Heights home Ms Ristevski shared with husband, Borce, while the other matched soil found in the Gisborne - Macedon area, where her decomposing body was found on Monday. \n“Let’s say there was a murder on the pitch at the MCG: that type of soil would be unique to that area of grass,” CSIRO Centre for Australian Forensic Soil Science director Dr Rob Fitzpatrick told the Herald Sun. \n“Each type of soil has its own specific characteristics, so it is possible to tell the difference.
