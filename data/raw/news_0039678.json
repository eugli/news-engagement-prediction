JUST WATCHED Pentagon considering proposing troops in Syria 03:00 Story highlights Mark Hertling: Reports of a presidential-directed review to step up ISIS fight don't signal anything close to a done deal He says such an idea would be part of military planners' exploration of options, and a careful consideration of outcomes Retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling is a national security, intelligence and terrorism analyst for CNN. He served for 37 years in the Army, including three years in combat, and retired as commanding general of US Army Europe and 7th Army. He is the author of \"Growing Physician Leaders.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his. (CNN) Throughout the 2016 election campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump repeatedly promised a new approach to battlefield victory over ISIS, saying he would ask \"the generals\" to provide a new plan within 30 days of his inauguration. This week Navy captain and Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis reported the Department of Defense was in the process of conducting the presidential-directed review, and that there were a number of measures they were considering to \"accelerate the campaign against ISIS,\" but no decisions had yet been made. CNN journalists followed this announcement by reporting that one proposal was to send additional combat forces to Syria. Is there a disconnect? How can the Pentagon say it is considering a \"number of measures\" when a news organization reports a proposal to send additional troops? What does all this mean? Having served as the Director, J7 -- the position that oversees war plans on the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon -- I know the details of the intricate, disciplined and multistepped planning process the US military uses before deploying forces into a combat situation. What may seem a tedious and meticulous process to many (especially political leaders or those who have never worn the cloth of the country), developing operational plans for war-fighting is designed to provide the best chance of mission accomplishment with the fewest number of American casualties. Critical questions for planning Read More Truth is, there are a lot of \"contingency plans\" already on the books for many potential hot spots (these are often reviewed according to published schedules). There are also multiple ongoing \"operations\" that are based on plans that are now being executed in various parts of the world (many Americans might be surprised at the actual numbers of plans that are driving the action of our military today). Finally, there are requirements to update, review and adjust plans and operations, based on changes in the world environment, new technologies, updated intelligence, or guidance received by either the secretary of defense or the President. When the military gets such directives, lots of things start to happen.
