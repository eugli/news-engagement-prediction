This is what it is like to dine as a VIP at a top London restaurant \nA top restaurateur has just revealed the tricks of the trade and explained how restaurants keep things running smoothly. \nGabe Garza, a partner in multiple Chicago restaurants, explained to the Wall Street Journal that restaurants will have calculated how long you’re going to spend before you’ve even arrived. \nA table of four, for example, generally tends to stay fifteen minutes’ longer than a table of two who have ordered the same amount of food and drinks. And restaurants cater for this. \nWhat’s more, with online booking services like OpenTable, restaurants can set how much turnaround time they need to re-set tables in between diners. \nAnother way restaurants prevent people from loitering too long at the best tables is to serve their food quicker - so not only are you getting the best spot in the house, but you’ll have to wait less time for your meal. It’s a win-win.
