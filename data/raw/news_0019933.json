Politics!\" If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 Over the weekend, Trump notably attacked a Seattle-based judge, Judge James Robart, after he temporarily blocked Trump's executive order banning travel to the US from seven Muslim-majority nations. The legal argument around Trump's travel ban challenges \"The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\" Trump tweeted on Saturday.

If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\" Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 Trump -- even as he blasted lawyers contesting his immigration executive order -- detailed for the first time Wednesday his own hesitations about the controversial plan before it was signed. Speaking to law enforcement officials in Washington, Trump said he argued before the order was finalized for giving travelers a month's notice before cutting off entry to the US, but was overruled by law enforcement officials, who he didn't name.
