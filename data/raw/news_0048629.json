The annual weekend gathering is known for providing an open and informal platform to meet in close quarters. Philipp Guelland / EPA \n\"I've had some rather contentious times with the press,\" Mattis told reporters during a trip to Abu Dhabi, according to a video published by Reuters. \"The press, as far as I'm concerned, are a constituency that we deal with, and I don't have any issues with the press myself.\" \nThe comments capped a tumultuous week for the fledgling administration, one that included (among other things) the resignation of national security Adviser Michael Flynn , the withdrawl of Andrew Pudzer , Trump's Labor Secretary nominee, and a 77-minute news conference in which Trump praised his administration's achievements and lambasted the media. \nOn Friday afternoon, Trump called NBC News, ABC, CBS, CNN and The New York Times \"fake news\" and \"the enemy of the American People\" on Twitter â€” a comment that drew near immediate scorn from Republican Sen. John McCain. \n\"If you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and many times adversarial press,\" McCain told \"Meet the Press .\"\"Without it, I am afraid that we would lose so much of our individual liberties over time.
