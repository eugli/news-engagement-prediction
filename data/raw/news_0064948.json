Prepare to be gassed.” \nRoblox is a gaming site that includes forums that touch on white nationalism. \nThe graffiti were quickly covered up. \n“It is important to me and to us that those words and images were quickly painted over as they have no place at this school, in this community, or in this country,” Parker wrote. \n“The words that are important to us at Gladstone are words like…respect, understanding, tolerance, and empathy … words and actions that demonstrate an inclusive and diverse culture.” \nMP Don Davies took to social media to condemn the graffiti. I condemn the racist, cowardly vandalism at @GladstoneSec . Our community is strong, diverse & welcoming to all. #cdnpoli #WeStandTogether \n— Don Davies, MP (@DonDavies) February 21, 2017 \nA similar incident took place at a Vancouver high school in December. \nPhrases like “Grab her by the p***y” and “There’s only 2 genders” adorned the school as well as trans-phobic language directed toward a specific school staff member. \n– With files from Sean Boynton © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:05:22.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
