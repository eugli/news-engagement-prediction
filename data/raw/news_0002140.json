According to Byran Alvarez, WWE is coming up with backup plans if The Architect can't make the show. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

WWE changed their plans and decided to put Joe on RAW instead and work a program with Rollins. \n\"Now with Rollins possibly being removed from WWE programming because of his knee injury, WWE is now considering putting Joe on SmackDown to work a WrestleMania program with Cena. Article continues below Adam Lallana reveals exactly what he eats in 24 hours - and it's ridiculous \n\"Another idea that was pitched at the meeting today would see an angle with Triple H and Samoa Joe that would eventually lead to a match between the two at WrestleMania.\" \nIt looks as though Samoa Joe could now work with either John Cena or The Game at WrestleMania 33 later this year if Rollins unable to perform at the event. Two big possible matches for The Destroyer despite only just debuting on the main event roster but, if you know about Joe's time before WWE, you know he is experienced enough for either clash. \nIt's a shame Rollins might not be able to compete, as many fans have been looking forward to a match between him and The Game at WrestleMania for several months now, only for it to potentially be put on hold after the events earlier this week. \nJudging by the fact The Architect recently tweeted out a photo of his knee in a medical sleeve, he probably won't be competing at the show, but at least WWE has some decent backup plans if that becomes the case. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
