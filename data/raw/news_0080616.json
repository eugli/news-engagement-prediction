Great! Many readers might be misled by Trump's tweet and might give him credit where he doesn't deserve it.\nBut look at the very top of the Politifact post. \"The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion,\" next to Politifact's cartoon \"Truth-O-Meter\" screaming \"Mostly False.\"\nThey're calling a plainly true fact \"Mostly False.\"\nIronically, in challenging Trump for failing to include important context, Politifact did the same: There's some real truth to their point, but they're leading the reader into falsehood by oversimplifying things.\nHis detractors scoff at Trump for targeting \"fake news\" while frequently bending the truth, yet that is exactly what Politifact did here.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Border apprehensions down in January, but still high A total of 31,575 people attempted to enter the U.S. through the southern border.\nBy Anna Giaritelli â€¢ 02/27/17 6:31 PM Emily Jashinsky is a commentary writer for the Washington Examiner. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:43:05.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
