I did so because it has become clear that I have become a distraction to the campaign,\" Kouvalis said in a statement posted to his Facebook page. \nKouvalis, was forced to apologize last week after he called a constitutional expert critical of Leitch's policies a \"cuck\" — short for cuckold — on Twitter. The term is used online by white nationalists and members of the so-called alt-right.\n\n\nI have resigned from the Kellie Leitch campaign. Full statement here: https://t.co/CNXgr8tUcC \n— @NickKouvalis \"When a member of a campaign team becomes the focus of media coverage, the time comes to resign,\" Kouvalis said in his statement.\n\"The campaign should be solely about the candidate and their plans, not their staff's beliefs, nor their staff's conduct,\" he said. \"It has also become clear to me that the pressures that come with a stressful campaign leadership role are not conducive to my personal wellbeing.\n\"I would like to give my heartfelt thanks to Kellie and the rest of the team. It has been a privilege to be part of this campaign, and I thank everyone for their support, confidence and friendship.\"\nKellie Leitch says her supporters aren't racist for backing values test", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:08:38.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
