A rebel fighter with an FSA group in the area said the incident took place on Sunday evening. \nThe Turkey-backed FSA rebels and Syrian government forces are fighting IS in separate campaigns in the region northeast of Aleppo. Russia, which backs the Syrian government, intervened to halt a previous such clash earlier this month. \n(Writing by Tom Perry; Editing by Catherine Evans) Next In World News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:43:32.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
