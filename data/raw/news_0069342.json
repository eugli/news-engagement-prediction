'Fundamental right' \nThe Army said on Thursday it had been instructed by President Jimmy Morales to act, and would defend \"human life and the laws of our country\" by preventing the group from carrying out abortions. \nThe Women on Waves' boat docked on the Pacific Ocean port of Quetzal, in the city of San Jose, on Wednesday. \nThe group says it had a legal permit to sail in Guatemalan waters and the boat was being illegally \"detained\" by the authorities. \nThe group says more than 60,000 illegal abortions are performed in Guatemala every year, and most of the women who put their lives at risk at the hands of untrained professionals are poor. \n\"We respect religious beliefs but this [abortion] is a fundamental right in a democracy,\" spokeswoman Leticia Zevich told La Hora Newspaper. \nHowever, Guatemala's Catholic Church, other religious leaders and politicians protested against the presence of the boat. \nIn most Latin American countries, abortion is either illegal or only allowed to save the life of the woman.
