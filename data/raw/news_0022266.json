It was the second place in the UK we launched our transport business and the food scene is great there. \n“With UberEATS, Mancunian foodies can enjoy dishes from eateries that wouldn’t normally deliver, allowing them to relish restaurant-worthy food in the comfort of their own homes.” UberEATS \nSeveral of the restaurants signed up will be exclusive to UberEATS, including newly-opened Indian street food kitchen Bundobust. \nMark Husak, co-founder of the Piccadilly restaurant and bar, said: “We’re over the moon to be partnering with UberEATS. The people of Manchester will be able to order the most authentic Indian street food this side of Mumbai to their homes and offices. \n\"As a new business in the city centre we are always looking at ways of spreading the good word of Bundobust and with UberEATS, we are confident we can reach out to a whole new customer base.” UberEAT's Manchester delivery zones \nThe Koffee Pot and The Alchemist will also be offering delivery for the first time via the app. \nSimon Potts, managing director at The Alchemist, said: “We’re excited to be one of the first bar and restaurants in Manchester to partner with UberEATS following its success in London. At The Alchemist we have a fantastic all-day menu with delicious dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as nibbles and it’s great to be able to bring that menu to new and familiar customers in such a convenient way.” \nUberEATS will be available seven days a week, from 11am to 11pm.
