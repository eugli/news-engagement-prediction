It also expressed confidence that the cleaning operation will be finished in a couple of days.\nAmong others, the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) was providing special bio-remediation material for treatment of the collected oil sludge for safe disposal.\n“The total quantity of sludge which was removed till February 2 was 65 tonnes. It is observed that there is a vast difference between quantity of oil spilt and sludge recovered due to the fact that the oil gets coagulated and becomes puffy when it is recovered with water and sand,” an official release said.\n“More than 90 percent of the work has been completed and most of the residual work is expected to be completed in a couple of days,” it said.\nFurther, ‘Super Suckers’ had removed 54 tonnes which contained 70 per cent water, it added.\n“The Indian Oil Corporation has provided special bio-remediation material for treatment of the collected oil sludge for its safe disposal.\n“HPCL has arranged for trailers and manpower for transporting collected sludge to Ennore port area for bio remediation treatment under the expert guidance of IOC R&D experts where 2000 Sq.M. pit has been created for the purpose,” the release said.\nYou May Also Want To Watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T09:37:45.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
