PTI /Los Angeles Filed on February 26, 2017 Share More > Vote \nDev Patel holds the award for best Supporting Actor, 'Lion' at the BAFTA at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Reuters Dev Patel little nervous about Oscars ceremony Dev Patel, who is nominated in the best supporting actor category for \"Lion\" at the 89 th Academy Awards, says whenever he thinks of the big night is just a week away, his heart rate rises a little bit. \"Lion\" is based on the true story of a five-year-old Indian boy, Saroo Brierley, who gets lost on the streets of Calcutta, thousands of kilometers from home. He survives many challenges before being adopted by a couple in Australia; 25 years later, he sets out to find his lost family. Patel, 26, said he is extremely happy with the kind of love his movie has received and that the Garth Davis-directed film is changing the lives of so many people in a positive way, reported People magazine.

The film is changing lives,\" he added. The actor will attend the February 26 th ceremony along with his mother, Anita Patel. \"As a child you may say to your parents, One day I am going to take you to the Oscars. But for that to actually materialize into a truth is quite amazing,\" he said. Watch: Lion trailer Movie review- 'Lion': An emotionally powerful film Adapted from Saroo Brierley's autobiography \"A Long Way Home\", director Garth Davis' \"Lion\" is an intimately emotional film despite an extremely underwritten screenplay. It is an adopted boy, Saroo's journey in search of his biological mother. We first meet Saroo (Sunny Pawar) at the age of 5, when he lives with his poor mother, older brother Guddu and younger sister in a shanty in Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh, India, in 1987. He often accompanies Guddu on trips to steal coal in order to support his family. One day after convincing his brother to let him come along, he accidentally boards a train and falls asleep. Film: 'Lion'; Starring: Nicole Kidman, David Wenham, Dev Patel, Roony Mara and Sunny Pawar. Rating:**** Next thing we know, Saroo is aboard a moving train. He is dropped 1,500 miles away from home in Calcutta. Terrified and unable to speak the language, he undergoes a series of traumatic experiences until he finally ends up being sent to Australia where he is adopted by a loving couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). Twenty years later, in Australia, Saroo seems like a privileged young man with a promising future, yet he is haunted by his unresolved past. Thanks to the internet boom, Saroo indulges in his computer and succeeds in his endeavour. The film with two distinct halves makes for a lopsided film experience, yet one that rallies to the end. Perhaps it is just the fact that Saroo's time as an adult just isn't as interesting as his struggles as a child which shows how a single minute accident can completely alter the course of one's life forever. The beauty of the narrative lies in the dynamics of its simplicity and simultaneous complexity. Shot on real locales with rustic characters, the telling of this story, without getting too cheesy is strongly reminiscent of \"Slumdog Millionaire\" and \"Salaam Mumbai\". What keeps you glued is undoubtedly the performances. Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:46:34.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
