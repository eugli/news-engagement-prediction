It drew focus on her strong support for secularism and a proposal in her presidential platform that promotes banishing headscarves and other obvious religious symbols in all public spaces.\n“I consider the headscarf a symbol of a woman’s submission,” Le Pen told reporters at the end of her visit. “I will not put on the veil.”\nLe Pen compared her refusal to wear the headscarf to the decision by former US First Lady Michelle Obama to decline wearing one during her state visit to Saudi Arabia.\nMarine Le Pen at the entrance to the headquarters of the Sunni Mufti.

Journalists shouted back that the two situations were not comparable because one is a state visit while the other is to a religious body. Le Pen dismissed the criticism.\nFrench law already bans headscarves in all classrooms except universities. She has proposed extending the 2004 law banning headscarves and other “ostentatious” religious symbols in classrooms to all public spaces. While the law covers all religions, it is widely viewed as aimed at Muslims.\nWhen asked if she fears her proposal may ignite the anger of the Muslim community, she said: “When in Rome do as the Romans do.”\nThe headscarf incident occurred ahead of a scheduled meeting with Lebanon’s grand mufti, Sheikh Abdel-Latif Derian.\nShortly after Le Pen arrived at his office, one of his aides handed her a white headscarf to put on. Following a discussion with his aides that lasted a few minutes, she refused and returned to her car.\nLe Pen said she had informed her host the night before that she would not wear the scarf but they didn’t cancel the meeting. Instead, she said, “They tried to impose it upon me.” She said the Grand Sheik of Al-Azhar, the head of the Sunni world’s most prestigious learning institute, didn’t require her to don the headscarf.\nMarine Le Pen was due to meet with Sheikh Abdel-Latif Derian.

The officials at the mufti’s office “kept the meeting and consequently put me before a fait accompli,” she said.\n“I stuck to my position, because when I take a position it corresponds to a conviction. If (you don’t like it) never mind.”\nThe office of Lebanon’s mufti issued a statement saying that Le Pen was told in advance through one of her aides that she would have to put on a headscarf during the meeting with the mufti.\n“This is the protocol” at the mufti’s office, the statement said. It said the mufti’s aides tried to give her the headscarf and that Le Pen refused to take it.\n“The mufti’s office regrets this inappropriate behaviour in such meetings,” the statement said.\nLe Pen has tried to raise her international profile and press her pro-Christian stance with her visit to Lebanon, a former French protectorate.\nMichelle Obama declined to wear a headscarf on a state visit to Saudi Arabia. Picture: AP Source: AP \nOn Monday, she met with President Michel Aoun, a Christian, and Prime Minister Saad Hariri, a Sunni Muslim. She said Syrian President Bashar Assad was “the most reassuring solution for France,” adding that the best way to protect minority Christians is to “eradicate” the Islamic State group. In her final press conference, she said that there is currently no alternative to the Assad government. She said she considered it a “mistake” that the French government had closed its embassy in Damascus, which undermined relations between French and Syrian security agencies that she said could have helped thwart terrorist attacks in France.\nSome Lebanese officials, including Hariri, have taken umbrage at what is widely seen as her stigmatisation of Muslims, whom her supporters claim are changing the Christian face of France.\nThere was also apparent displeasure at her comments on Assad, including from some Lebanese allies.\nLebanon: 'Fascists out!' - protesters rally against Le Pen's Beruit visit 1:45 Scores of protesters rallied in central Beirut, Tuesday, to demonstrate against French presidential candidate for the Front National Marine Le Pen who was due to hold a press conference at Zaitunay Bay as part of her two-day visit to the country. The protest action reportedly compelled the organisers to change the venue of the press conference. The protesters chanted slogans condemning Le Pen's immigration policies while holding placards reading \"Fascists out\" and \"You are not welcome.\" Protester, Farah Dbouk, denounced the politician, stating \"She is a truly racist person. She adopts a racist agenda [and] promotes xenophobia, hatred of refugees and Islamophobia.\" Earlier in the week, Le Pen met with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri and Lebanese President Michel Aoun, marking her first official one-on-one meeting with a head of state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:22:20.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
