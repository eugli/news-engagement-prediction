He had two weeks and we were up front and honest with him about where we're at. More than anything, you look at the depth, there's just not going to be a spot.\" Porter told Oregonlive . \nAdu is currently looking for a team after parting ways with Tampa Bay Rowdies in 2016. The forward made just 12 appearances for the North American Soccer League side, scoring once. \nWhat could have been. After scoring four goals as a 14-year-old at the 2003 FIFA U-17 World Championship, Adu had scored 11 goals and 17 assists in MLS between 2004 and 2006. He was just 16 -years-old. \nIt looked promising for Adu when he signed for Benfica in 2007 but after loan spells at Monaco, Belenenses and Ã‡aykur Rizespor, he moved back to the MLS after scoring just two goals for the Portuguese side. \nHe is now a free agent. Surely he'd do a job in the Championship or League One? \nHelp Freddy.
