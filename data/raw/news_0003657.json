Cavs forward Kevin Love scores over Sixers center Jahlil Okafor (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:54 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:54 p.m. ET \nWith the Feb. 23 trade deadline fast approaching, it's hard to keep track of all the trade rumors and speculation flying around the NBA. Don't worry. We've got you covered. \nA lot of big names have been circulating, and we've gotten to the part of the season when even the players can't ignore the potential deals. (Looking at you, Carmelo Anthony .) \nThese things are fluid, so keep in mind nothing is final until the call to the league office is made and the physicals are passed. With that said, here's all the trade talk you may have missed from Feb. 3: Jahlil Okafor heading back home to Chicago? \nThe Bulls have inquired about 76ers big man Jahlil Okafor , according to CSN Chicago . Okafor, a Chicago native, has gotten caught in Philly's frontcourt logjam in his second season. \nThe Sixers will continue to build around potential superstar Joel Embiid, and Nerlens Noel, Ersan Ilyasova and Dario Saric all stepped up when Okafor missed significant time in January with a knee injury. That's without mentioning rookie Ben Simmons, who could make his debut after the All-Star break. \nMORE: Why trading for Okafor would be wrong move for Bulls \nOkafor could benefit from a change of scenery, but Chicago may not be the best fit for his game. The Bulls have been dreadful from the outside offensively, and a post player like Okafor would only clog up the lane for slashers like Dwyane Wade and Jimmy Butler. \nA potential Okafor deal would likely involve a third team as the Bulls won't be — or at least shouldn't be — willing to give away valuable draft picks for Okafor and don't have the kind of players to entice Chicago. CSN Chicago reports there is more interest from the Bulls than Sixers at this point, so this deal could hinge on Chicago coming up with an offer that would change Philly's mind. Kevin Love doesn't see a trade in his future \nDespite trade talks surfacing about a Carmelo Anthony-for-Kevin Love trade, the Cavs' All-Star forward doesn't expect to be moved before the deadline. \nLove believes he will be in Cleveland \"for a long time\" and laughed off the latest trade speculation ( via ESPN.com ): \"I said it doesn't matter if I have an All-Star year or its one start or the other, it's always going to be there, right?\" \nMORE: Cavs want Carmelo ... under one condition \nNearly a decade into his NBA career, Love has grown accustomed to being in the middle of possible trades dating back to his time with the Timberwolves. Learning to deal with trade rumors, he says, is simply \"part of the growth process.\" \nCleveland.com reports Love will be ready to play against the Knicks after missing Cleveland's past two games with back spasms. His return provides an entertaining backdrop for Saturday night's game (8:30 p.m. ET, ABC). Nuggets shut down Wilson Chandler, Emmanuel Mudiay rumors \nNuggets coach Mike Malone has heard those trade rumors about Wilson Chandler and Emmanuel Mudiay. USA Today reports Chandler is frustrated with his role and wants out, and ESPN reports the Nuggets are \"quietly exploring\" what they could get for Mudiay. \nWell, Malone just isn't buying any of it. \nMORE: Nuggets looking to move frontcourt pieces to highlight Nikola Jokic's improved play \n\"I dismiss the report as BS, if you will — which you get a lot of this time of year,\" Malone said (via ESPN.com ). \"Obviously, Wilson can answer that himself when the time comes. But I've never heard anything close to that from Wilson.\" \nMalone also said Mudiay is \"a big part of our future\" and added that Nuggets general manager Tim Connelly told Mudiay not to believe any of the trade chatter. \nDenver could be just putting Mudiay's name out there to see what kind of return the second-year player would yield, but there's nothing concrete yet. If Chandler is unhappy with how Malone has used him, his name could gain some traction in the coming weeks. Chandler is averaging 15.4 points per game on 45.1 percent shooting from the field, including 35.1 percent from 3-point range. He could be a valuable asset for a playoff team. Nets want a lot in return for Brook Lopez \nNets play-by-play announcer Ian Eagle confirmed previous reports about center Brook Lopez, telling NetsDaily.com that Brooklyn is \"not giving him away.\" \n\"I know the asking price is legitimately high,\" Eagle said. \"Look around, not a lot of guys who can do what he does. I don’t believe they’re going to get desperate and feel the need to dump him.\" \nMORE: Bucks drop Miles Plumlee's awful contract in trade with Hornets \nLopez is averaging 20.3 points, 5.1 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.6 blocks per game. He's also added a 3-point shot to his offensive game this season, shooting 34.6 percent from beyond the arc on 5.3 attempts per game. \nTeams might be scared away from Lopez since he has one year and $22.6 million left on his contract after this season. That's a big payout, and Eagle says the Nets could be looking for a lottery pick and another first-round pick in return. \nThe Nets are in the driver's seat. It appears they'll be content to keep Lopez if they don't like any of the offers in front of them.
