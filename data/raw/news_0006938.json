But not Pence. The network reportedly declined. \nThese will be Pence’s first appearances on the Sunday shows since he took the oath as Vice President. Later in the day, Trump will appear in a pre-taped interview with Bill O’Reilly on Fox set to air during the network’s Super Bowl pregame show. \nRead the full report here , via the Huffington Post \n[ image via screengrab ] \nFollow Joe DePaolo (@ joe_depaolo ) on Twitter \nHave a tip we should know?
