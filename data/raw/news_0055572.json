Old Rip Van Winkle 25-Year-Old Bourbon was distilled in the spring and fall of 1989 and stored on lower levels of a metal warehouse built in 1935 at the Van Winkle family distillery. In 2002 the barrels found a new home at Buffalo Trace and in 2014 the juice was dumped into stainless steel tanks to halt the aging process. And now, it's ready for release. But only 11 barrels made the full trip, resulting in a mere 710 bottles. Each one is housed in a handmade glass decanter with bottle information, individual numbering, and a hand finished silver stopper. The special bottles reside in a handmade wooden box that comes with a bourbon certificate of authenticity, numbered and signed by Julian Van Winkle himself. Buffalo Trace O.F.C. Bourbon \nIt should be no surprise that one of the rarest bourbons ever released comes from the fine folks at Buffalo Trace. Buffalo Trace O.F.C. Bourbon has been generously offered exclusively to non-profit organizations at no charge to help raise money for their causes. Out of the first release comes this bottle — one of only 100 — from 1980. Named after the O.F.C. Distillery christened by Colonel E.H. Taylor back in 1870, this nearly 40-year-old bourbon is not only special juice, but it also gets special packaging. The lead-free crystal bottle is a replica of an O.F.C. decanter dating back to the early 1900s and features detailed fluting engraved into the mold. Then shoulder facets are cut by glass artisans, and then the bottle is manually polished before inlaying cut copper lettering. This bottle is up for auction from Living Jazz , launched in 1984 with a mission to empower children and adults, inspire creative growth, and unite diverse communities through music.
