Hot, dry conditions fan wildfires in Chile Read more \nThe drinking-water supply for over a million households in Santiago had been affected, and Aguas Andinas, the company that provides water to the capital, said rains were making repairs difficult. Agence France-Presse estimated four million people were affected. \n“Emergency teams are working on the ground to connect with isolated persons and re-establish the water supply wherever possible,” Chilean president Michelle Bachelet wrote on Twitter. \nIn the O’Higgins region, south of Santiago, a 12-year-old girl was killed when a landslide swept away the car in which she was travelling.

Last April, heavy rains battered the San Jose de Maipo valley, killing one and shutting production at some of the largest copper mines in the world. \nMining giants Antofagasta, state-owned Codelco , and Anglo American have sizeable deposits in the zone affected by this weekend’s rains. \nAll three said production had not been affected.
