Eike Schroter/ABC) ABC's 'When We Rise' follows tumultuous times in gay rights movement By Gail Pennington St. Louis Post-Dispatch Feb 24, 2017 ( … ) ABC \n\"When We Rise,\" an eight-hour, four-night miniseries beginning Monday, Feb. 27, on ABC, follows the gay rights movement through five decades, beginningin 1973. Eike Schroter/ABC) TownNews.com Content Exchange \nDustin Lance Black delved deep into the life and death of Harvey Milk, assassinated in 1978 just 11 months after becoming the first openly gay elected official in California, and won a screenplay Oscar for the resulting 2008 movie, “Milk.” \nThis week, Black returns to the subject of gay rights pioneers for “When We Rise,” an eight-hour, four-night ABC miniseries spanning five decades of struggle that changed both laws and attitudes. His protagonists are real people, including Cleve Jones, the young aide played by Emile Hirsch in “Milk.” \nBut don’t think Black recycled “Milk” leftovers for the miniseries. \nFour years ago, when ABC expressed interest in his idea of telling a substantive story of the gay rights movement, Black plunged into extensive new research, he told TV critics last month in Los Angeles. \n“I took a year going out and looking for a handful of true stories of actual people who had fought in other civil rights movements, who had done so for an extended period of time, meaning from the early ’70s until now,” Black said. \nStudying “the women’s movement, the black civil rights movement, the peace movement of the late ’60s and early ’70s,” he arrived at “the cast of real characters who you meet along the way” in “When We Rise.” \nCleve Jones, played by Austin P. McKenzie and Guy Pearce, makes a repeat appearance because he is so significant, Black said. \n“The life span of an activist is often three to six years. It’s exhausting, often unrewarding work.” But Black said Jones stayed in the movement for 45 years. “It was hard not to use him as someone who would pull us through.” \nEach of the three main characters — including Roma Guy, who fought to have lesbians made part of the “women’s lib” movement, and Ken Jones, fresh out of the Vietnam War and working to integrate the Navy — is played by two different actors, first as young people and then as their mature selves. \nAll three protagonists are symbolic of activists who fight discrimination wherever they confront it, Black said. \n“There is a selflessness to the folks who seem to be able to survive the ups and downs of being involved in the movement. There’s an understanding that I hope the show conveys, which is that you’re going to face not just backlash from the outside, but from within your own community, and that also has to be survived.” \nThese are “incredibly unique, strong, special people,” Black said. “And it was important to me, in deciding who to depict, that many are still alive, because I do hope that a new generation looks to these people for inspiration and we can find ourselves with more leaders like this. We need those people now more than ever.” \nThe current generation of activists is in many ways oblivious to what went before, Black said, failing to understand “that they have forefathers and foremothers who have been fighting for them for some time.” \nYoung people also need to see that “over the course of any social justice movement, there is backlash,” he said. “You see that several times in this series. And there are ways to confront backlash for a young generation. There are ways to keep the pendulum from swinging back too far.” \nHe hopes this young audience will watch “When We Rise” and see “that the ‘We’ is the most important word in the title,” Black said. “The way to push back and to succeed is to do it together and to understand interconnectedness of social justice movements. I need a young generation to see that and understand that.” \nBlack made the miniseries thinking of his own family. \n“I grew up in the South,” he said. “I grew up in a religious home. I grew up in a military home. I grew up in a conservative home. My family is still religious and Southern and conservative, and I love them. ... I wrote this for my cousins and my aunts and my uncles and my family. I wrote this for my family from that other America to say, ‘Hey, we’ve got more in common than you think, and we can actually speak the same language.’” \nWith “When We Rise” finished, Black isn’t moving on from LGBT history. \n“It hasn’t all been written yet, and it certainly hasn’t been brought to the public in a popularized, easily accessible fashion,” he said. “Movements survive on their stories. We see this in other civil rights movements, in the songs, in the books, in the poems, in the movies and television shows, and it’s a necessary element of a movement to have a history.” \nPart I • In 1973, we meet the three protagonists, all based on real people: Cleve (Austin P. McKenzie), a young Quaker; Ken (Jonathan Majors), an African-American sailor; and Roma (Emily Skeggs), an active feminist. All head for San Francisco, Cleve to join the peace movement, Ken to lead a new military desegregation program and Roma to open a women’s center. “As these idealistic social-justice fighters come out or are outed, they are forced from their jobs, their movements and their homes,” according to ABC’s material about the show. Thus, they are driven to “join the fledgling LGBTQ movement and together, locked arm in arm, set out to change the world.” \nPart II • It’s 1978, and Cleve, Ken and Roma work together to defeat a California proposition that would ban gays from working in public schools. Cleve works on the campaign to elect Harvey Milk as San Francisco’s first gay city supervisor. (Cleve Jones was played by Emile Hirsch in the 2008 movie “Milk.”) Ken lives secretly with his boyfriend, Richard, a social worker who would lose his job if outed. Roma learns that her ex-girlfriend, Diane (Fiona Dourif), is having a baby via do-it-yourself insemination. “Just as gays and lesbians are gaining political power in 1981, a disease dubbed ‘gay cancer’ begins taking the lives of gay men and IV drug users.” \nPart III • In the early 1990s, AIDS continues to ravage the gay community, and Cleve (now Guy Pearce), Ken (Michael Kenneth Williams) and Richard (Sam Jaeger) are all infected. Ken helps to create the Names Project AIDS Memorial quilt but eventually finds he has lost relevance in the LGBTQ movement. Ken enters a VA hospital but still must abide by “don’t ask, don’t tell” policies. Roma (now Mary-Louise Parker) and Diane (Rachel Griffiths) raise Diane’s daughter, Annie, but get a shock when her father is revealed. \nPart IV • It’s 2008, and a newly energized Cleve helps to inspire a march on Washington demanding LGBTQ equality and takes the battle against discriminatory Prop 8 to the Supreme Court. Roma fights for universal health care in San Francisco. Ken helps an inclusive church found a meal program but “struggles to reconcile his sexual orientation with his love of God.” In the end, “all of their fates hang on the decision of nine justices in the nation’s highest court.” \nGail Pennington • 314-340-8136", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T09:46:35.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
