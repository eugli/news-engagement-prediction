(TIME) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  31 AM \nAn iconic Ebola fighter who was honored as Time's 2014 person of the year for her work with victims of the illness died from childbirth complications after doctors were too scared to treat her due to her own history with the disease. \nSalome Karwah lost her mother, father, brother, aunts, uncles cousins and a niece amid the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, TIME reported. The virus claimed 11,210 lives, but the Liberian nursing assistant, along with her sister, Josephine Manley, and her fiancé survived the epidemic that swept through her town in August several years ago. \nThough she escaped the deadly disease years ago, the lasting stigma still surrounding Ebola may have cost Karwah her life, according to the magazine. She died Feb. 21, 2017, days after giving birth to her fourth child. \nKarwah used to joke that she had “super powers” because having overcome Ebola made her immune to it. She used her new special skills at the hospital where she had been cared for — the Médecins Sans Frontières Ebola treatment unit — to take care of others struggling through the illness. \nEbola vaccine 100% effective: study \n“It hurts like they are busting your head with an ax,” Karah said of the disease in 2014. \nThe assistant nurse was not only able to understand what they were going through, but could comfort them with a hands-on touch those without immunity to the deadly disease couldn’t offer, TIME reported. \n“I can do things that other people can’t,” she previously told the magazine. “If an Ebola patient is in his house, and his immediate relative cannot go to him, I can go to him. I can take [care of] him.” Ebola virus continues deadly spread across Africa \nIt was her dedication to fighting the deadly disease with compassion that landed her on the cover of TIME in 201 4 along with several other high-profile Ebola fighters. \nShortly after the outbreak ended, Karwah married her fiancé and gave birth to her third child, who she named Destiny. \nShe got pregnant again and delivered a healthy boy on Feb. 17 . She was discharged from the hospital three days later, according to the magazine. \nWithin hours of her return home, however, Karwah began experiencing convulsions. Her husband and sister rushed her back to the hospital where the staff there refused to touch her — Karwah's seizures and foaming mouth terrified workers there. \n“They said she was an Ebola survivor,” Manley told TIME. “They didn’t want contact with her fluids. They all gave her distance. No one would give her an injection.” \nManley added she didn’t know what caused the convulsions but speculated that her sister could’ve survived if she’d received immediate treatment. Instead, “she was stigmatized.” Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:05:26.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
