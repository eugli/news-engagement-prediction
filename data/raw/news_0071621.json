Hinsdale Central sophomore Donovan Lahmann won the 100-yard and 200-yard freestyle events at the Downers Grove Sectional on Saturday. (Jon Cunningham / Pioneer Press) Gregg Voss Pioneer Press \nHinsdale Central boys swimming and diving coach Bob Barber calls sprint freestyler Donovan Lahmann the \"future of the program.\" \nGiven the storied history of the Red Devils' boys swimming team, which has produced numerous state champions, that's a lot to put on a sophomore. \nBut Lahmann appears ready to accept that responsbility, showing Saturday at the Downers Grove South Sectional that he is very much part of the present of the program, as well. \nLahmann, from Clarendon Hills, won every event he participated in, including the 200-yard freestyle (1:41.67), 100 freestyle (47.23), 200 freestyle relay (1:23.71) and 400 freestyle relay (3:08.21). In addition to qualifying for the state meet, which will be held Friday and Saturday at New Trier, that effort propelled the Red Devils to the team title with 299 points. Lyons, the 2016 state champion, finished second with 283. \n\"I think he puts his head down and he goes,\" Barber said of Lahmann. \"He's got his own internal goals. Obviously, there are team components, and then there are individual components, and he works very hard. ... I've seen him basically train 11 of 12 months out of the year.\" \nLahmann's sectional performance was a strong follow-up to the West Suburban Silver meet Feb. 4, where he led off the winning 400 freestyle relay and raced the third leg of the runner-up 200 freestyle relay. \nAs a freshman last season, Lahmann swam a leg of the Red Devils' 200 freestyle relay that took first at the 2016 state meet. He said his experience at state, where Hinsdale Central finished third last season, motivated himself to improve during the offseason. \n\"I've been focusing on the little things more, like my starts and turns, and I've definitely improved my kickouts,\" said Lahmann, who also swims at WEST Superior Training in Willowbrook. \"I remember I would get smoked off the walls at state last year, and that was a real eye-opener. I've gotten stronger because I've been lifting more in the offseason.\" \nBarber said he can see a marked difference between Lahmann's freshman and sophomore years, especially in one key area. \n\"He came to realize he really needs to be accountable in practice, so he's practiced extremely hard,\" he said. \nHinsdale Central swimming notes \nHinsdale Central senior Franco Reyes shattered the pool record Saturday by nearly two seconds in winning the 100 butterfly in 49.74. The Georgia Tech recruit also qualified in the 50 freestyle, finishing second (21.38), as well as swimming legs of the Red Devils' first-place 200 freestyle and 200 medley relays. \n\"It's always great to break a record,\" Reyes said. \nOther individual sectional champions for the Red Devils included freshman Cullen Cochlan in the 200 individual medley (1:55.96); junior Cole Grosshans in the 50 freestyle (21.31); and sophomore Trystan Lundgren in the 100 breaststroke (58.01). \nGregg Voss is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press. \nTwitter @Pioneer_Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:36:55.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
