Over 1.50 lakh vehicles use the stretch every day. \nTraffic police had a tough time managing traffic from 7 am till 5.30 pm until the truck carrying jersey barriers was removed. Though the vehicle broke down late on Monday night, traffic congestion was noticed from 7 am on Tuesday when vehicular movement started increasing. \nThe traffic police from Delhi as well as Noida had summoned cranes to remove the truck but the truck could not be removed as its axle had broken down. \nRead: ‘Crazy traffic madness...’: Delhi’s traffic woes continue \nSuperintendent of police (traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar, Prabal Pratap Singh said, “A huge goods carrier broke down late last night and it led to traffic jam. Traffic teams of Noida and Delhi Police tried to lift it with cranes, but didn’t succeed. Mechanical engineers are looking into it.” \nIt took commuters over three hours to cover a distance of nearly five kilometers. \nParvesh Arora, a resident of sector 31, Faridabad reached his office in Sector 63, Noida in nearly five hours. “I started from my house around 8.45 am. It takes me nearly 70 to 80 minutes to reach office. But today I reached office at 1.45 pm when my colleagues were having their lunch,” he said. \nRead: Stuck in Delhi traffic jam, woman gives birth in an auto-rickshaw \nAnother commuter, Avinash Gupta, who boarded a bus from the Apollo Hospitals, Delhi around 9 am reached his office in sector 58 at 12.30 pm. “The bus had barely moved 200 metres towards Jasola when I saw the traffic mess. I got off and walked down nearly three kilometers to cross the stretch where the truck had broken down,” he said. \nThe commuters driving from Noida to Delhi also had to face the consequences of the spillover. “It takes me 20 to 25 minutes to reach my workshop at Madanpur Khadar in Delhi. But today it took me two hours to cover the distance. There was a mess near the MCD checkpost at Kalindi Kunj and then right up to Sarita Vihar as some of the vehicles were driving in the wrong direction,” said Vijay Singh Kuttu, a resident of sector 41, Noida. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:33:03.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
