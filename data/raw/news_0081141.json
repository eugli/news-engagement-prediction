Bobde and L.N. Rao observed that though “everybody knows that children with Down Syndrome are undoubtedly less intelligent, but they are fine people.” \nThe bench said as per the report, the foetus is “likely to have mental and physical challenges” but the advice of the doctors does not warrant termination of pregnancy. \n“With this report, we don’t think we are going to allow termination of pregnancy. We have a life in our hands,” the bench said. “In these circumstances, as per the present advice, it is not possible to grant permission to terminate the pregnancy,” the court said.
