Thames Valley Police Superintendent Gez Chiariello is facing an investigation into claims said to include allegations over his interaction with women. Mr Chiariello, 46, who was the commander of the force's Milton Keynes police area, is about to become a father with his new partner PC Jess Lomax. A probe by the force's professional standards department investigation will possibly lead to a disciplinary hearing that could see him sacked. Mr Chiariello's police Twitter account was closed this week, and sources said he had been sent home from work and was looking after Miss Lomax.
