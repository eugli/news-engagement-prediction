Armstrong, who contends that the USPS benefits outweighed the sponsorship costs, sought to have the case decided by summary judgment in April 2016. \n“Because the government has offered evidence that Armstrong withheld information about the team’s doping and use of PEDs and that the anti-doping provisions of the sponsorship agreements were material to USPS’s decision to continue the sponsorship and make payments under the agreements, the Court must deny Armstrong’s motion for summary judgment on this issue,” Judge Christopher Cooper of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in a 37-page ruling on Monday. \nThe USPS paid around $32.3 million to Armstrong’s cycling team, the now-defunct Tailwind Sports Corp, from 2000 to 2004, looking to capitalize on Armstrong’s Tour de France victories, as well as his “compelling personal story,” Cooper said in his ruling. \nThe government has calculated damages at three times this amount. Landis stands to gain up to 25 percent of whatever sum the government recovers. \nPaul Scott, an attorney for Landis, said by email, “We look forward to the day soon when we can put this case before the jury at long last.” © 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:16:48.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
