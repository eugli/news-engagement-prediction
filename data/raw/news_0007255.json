I've decided to sign to my home town team, The Oregon Ducks. Go Ducks! pic.twitter.com/AbYftuYNp6 -- Cody Shear (@Codyshear7) February 1, 2017 \n\"It's hard to look past your dream,\" Shear said. \"I've been an Oregon Duck fan since the day I showed up on the Earth. There were definitely times that I was thinking Arizona didn't deserve this. Those coaches were the first Power 5 conference team to offer me, and their coaches are class acts.\" \nFor Shear, the commitment to Oregon marks the end of a stressful flirtation with the Ducks that lasted two coaching staffs and several months. \nThat flirtation finally turned to a commitment on Oregon's behalf Wednesday morning. \n\"I got a text from coach (Mario) Cristobal really early this morning,\" Shear explained. \"I talked to him the first time at 5:30. Basically, he said, 'I'm in a meeting right now. I need to know what time you are signing.' I told him I was supposed to sign with Arizona at 7 o' clock. I got a text that told me to call coach Willie Taggart before I signed, and he told me, 'You've grown up down the street from Autzen. Who do you want to play for?' I told him Oregon and they offered me a full ride.\" \nNot surprisingly, Shear's announcement was met with a quick phone call from a close friend and familiar face for Duck fans. \nThe first guy that called me was Alex Forsyth,\" Shear said. \"We're friends, so he was just really excited for me.\" \nShear is the third offensive lineman in the class for Oregon, joining Forsyth and George Moore, the nation's No. 1 junior college offensive lineman. \nHe also marks the fourth Arizona commit to flip to the Ducks since Taggart's hiring, joining quarterback Braxton Burmeister, defensive lineman Austin Faoliu and athlete Darrian McNeal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T21:30:21.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
