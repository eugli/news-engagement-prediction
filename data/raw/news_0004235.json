The 19-year-old has been involved in 3 goals in his first 3 games, and as a result of his fine form, Sergio Aguero was benched against West Ham on Wednesday. \nAccording to The Mirror, Spanish giants Real Madrid have picked up on Aguero's situation at Manchester City and are ready to make a bid to sign the player. \nReal Madrid are reportedly ready to offload both Karim Benzema and Alvaro Morata in the summer to make way. \nLos Blancos have been linked with Aguero for some time now, but if the 28-year-old's faces more time out of the Manchester City starting line-up, then a move to Real Madrid is arguably more likely than ever before. \nThe Mirror also report that Juventus and Paris Saint Germain could also be interested in signing the forward. \nShould Aguero leave or does he have more to give at Manchester City? \nLet us know your thoughts.
