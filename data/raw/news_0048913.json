No way.\"\nWater welled in Mary Jo Marsden's eyes as she thought back on her long teaching career.\nShe paused for a moment to collect her thoughts and stifle tears before continuing.\n\"The last 10 years were devastating,\" said the retired teacher.\n\"To see things taken away one little tiny bit at a time, and then a chunk here and a chunk there.\"\nShe recalled good times and rewarding work throughout most of her career. However, deep budget cuts and systemic changes to education in Newfoundland and Labrador has left a stain on her view of teaching.\n\"It's like we got on this roller coaster and we can't get off,\" Marsden said.\n\"And who are we hurting but the children?\"\nWould you do it again? During CBC's unprecedented Inside the Classroom forum, teachers, principals, and counsellors from across the province had a chance to air their concerns with the education system.\nWhen teachers talk: Why CBC gathered 30 teachers to take us Inside the Classroom\nVIDEO: Inside the Classroom: Focusing on academic programs\n​​ At the end of a discussion that spanned an afternoon in January, they were asked if they would start over again in the same profession.\nFor Angela Dawe, it's a toss up.\nJunior high teacher Angela Dawe said she feels defeated in the classroom, and knowing what she knows now, she's not sure if she would have chosen teaching as her career. (CBC)\n\"I ponder,\" she said.\n\"I love my kids dearly. I love teaching. But given the system I'm teaching in right now, I don't think I would [do it again].\"\nDawe, who's a music teacher at a junior high school on the northeast Avalon, said despite her best efforts, she goes home feeling defeated.\nShe said she wishes she had more time with students to form relationships, and that she didn't feel so frustrated.\n'I love my kids dearly. I love teaching. But given the system I'm teaching in right now, I don't think I would [do it again].'\n- Angela Dawe , junior high teacher She also said she wished things could be as good as she knows they could be, if her school only had the resources she feels it requires.\n\"I find it really challenging,\" Dawe said.\n\"I have three degrees that have all focused towards being a music teacher, and I doubt myself many times.\"\nAbove and beyond service Rather than retire after her 30th year of service, Donna Reddick decided to keep working.\nWhen asked if she would do it again, she did not hesitate to say yes.\n\"For me, it's all about the child,\" she said.\n\"I love spending my day with the little ones. I like seeing the 'A-ha' moments.\"\nElementary teacher Donna Reddick said without a doubt, if given the chance to start over, she would choose teaching as her occupation. (CBC)\nAs an elementary school science teacher, she said she enjoys the little things, like showing children how to use copper wire and a battery to create an electric current.\n\"I love seeing that light bulb come on. I really do. It's so intrinsically rewarding for me and my students,\" she said.\n\"I still have that drive. I still have that energy.\"\nIncreasingly, Reddick is having a harder time finding those 'A-ha' moments. She shares the same frustrations as the other teachers in the forum.\n'I worry about our younger teachers. Our teachers who are just beginning. What are they going to face?... And how is that going to impact the students?'\n- Donna Reddick, elementary school teacher As hard as she tries, she said she feels she can't give the students everything they need.\n\"When my students go home at the end of the day, I sit down and I have a big sigh.
