Their opposition set up a 50-50 tie in the Senate if all Democrats vote against her and no other Republicans dissent. Pence would be the tie-breaker.\nDeVos has faced fierce criticism from labor unions for her promotion of school choice. Democrats and teachers' organizations also accuse her of seeking to dismantle public education.\nThe Senate vote is Tuesday.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:12:26.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
