(He also admits that he hadn't fully completed an album, and worked with this schedule to meet his own deadlines.) \nThe Bachelor may be partly to blame, as it's a bit of a time-suck for him as he just can't get enough. He loves it, but can't do two-hour episodes. It's too much. \n\"I always watch the season premiere, and at the end of it, they say, 'On an unbelievable new Bachelor ...' and I go, 'SHOW ME MORE OF THIS! SHOW ME MORE OF THIS! I'll pay $50 if you just show me the entire season in thirty minutes. That's what I want. Just get me the helicopters, girls crying, girls crying on helicopters — if you get tears in flight on The Bachelor , that's prime stuff.\" \nHas he ever thought about sitting in the Bachelor chair himself? \"I think it would be one of the lowest-rated shows.\" Suuuuper doubt it, John, but live your truth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T19:33:58.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
