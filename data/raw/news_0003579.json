Picture: Troy Snook\nPrincipal Graham Holmes said it was a “pretty special day” for the kids, parents and teachers alike.\n“The staff’s reaction has been interesting which tells me that something like this doesn’t happen too often,” he said.\n“It’s certainly unusual and there are plenty of people around today who are both excited and proud.”\nMr Holmes said there were two schools of thought when it came to teaching twins.\n“Do you keep them together or separate them?” he said.\n“One thing is certain you have to communicate very well with families and basically follow the parent’s wishes.\n“There are lots of different thoughts as to which is better for them but in the end it comes down to the family’s wishes as well as ongoing communication with their teachers.\n“You also have to remember that although they are twins they will also be very much individuals with their own individual personality and individual interests.”\nmedia_camera The three sets of twins started kindergarten at Lake Munmorah Public School today. Picture: Troy Snook\nNot yet used to processing repeated instructions in a school environment, the trio of twins faded in and out of enthusiasm but ear to ear smiles were a constant on their faces for their first day of big school.\nRosie said the thing she was most looking forward to was meeting new friends.\n“It’ll be fun playing with my classmates,” she said.\n“I also like playing hide and seek as well as writing and drawing.”\nHer brother Zac said he was looking forward to playtime.\n“It’ll be good running around in the playground and doing backflips,” he said.\nTheir teacher Kylie Nebauer has been teaching for 18 years but remarkably has never taught twins before.\nShe said it was shaping up to be a fun year.\n“They will know each other so well and they’ve always got a friend if they get nervous or upset,” Mrs Nebauer said.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fnews-story%2F3c3d4a7b2a39d34685877c3ba8ec0664", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Triple%20treat%20on%20first%20day%20of%20school&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fnews-story%2F3c3d4a7b2a39d34685877c3ba8ec0664", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/46c9ce4c6779aa203686ae8619666959?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/3c3d4a7b2a39d34685877c3ba8ec0664?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storyheader/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_noGallery=true&td_device=desktop", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/3c3d4a7b2a39d34685877c3ba8ec0664?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storymeta/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_noGallery=true&td_device=desktop", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fnews-story%2F3c3d4a7b2a39d34685877c3ba8ec0664&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fnews-story%2F3c3d4a7b2a39d34685877c3ba8ec0664", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/efc06dc26fe066a0ec8be683b51a17b5?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/19e9727e0361ee55d502f7e9f48cc4c4?width=1024", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/central-coast", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/3c3d4a7b2a39d34685877c3ba8ec0664?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_noGallery=true&td_device=desktop", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js"], "published": "2017-02-01T19:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T16:41:56.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
