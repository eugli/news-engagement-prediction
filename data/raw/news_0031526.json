Surrounded by tons of dancers and crazy set pieces, she managed to make the performance seem simultaneously huge and intimate, even while being suspended dangerously in a chair.\nViewers were blown away not only by the theatrical performance, but by the fact that Bey did it all while visibly expecting.\nBeyoncé performed at the Grammy&apos;s while pregnant y&apos;all I can&apos;t even make myself a sandwich if I have period cramps\n— Tor ( @Toe_Jamm ) February 13, 2017 I can die now.
