The new location will be the third for Sear Shack, which opened its first location in Collierville in 2015. Two Sacramento industrial sites are part of a sale-leaseback deal announced Wednesday… more Alex Sear Shack president Joseph Ang said he was drawn to the Bartlett location because of the income demographics of the area plus the abundance of traffic that will pass the restaurant. “I think [Bartlett] is a place that’s really in need of a local burger joint,” Ang said. The new location, which Ang hopes to have open by June 1, will operate under a 10-year lease and take up 2,600 square feet of space, according to Boyle Investment Company’s Jonathan Aur , who negotiated the lease for Sear Shack. But before the Bartlett location opens, Ang is already looking for the restaurant’s fourth and fifth locations, hoping to grow at a pace of almost three new restaurants per year. “We’re definitely going to hit Mississippi. Olive Branch is looking pretty good right now [for the fourth location]. Then Southaven and Hernando maybe. … We’re thinking maybe one day, if possible, we’ll head down to Oxford,” Ang said. “And, if we’re cool and hip enough, maybe Midtown Memphis — if they’ll take us.” Ang said he is confident in the restaurant’s food and branding, so all he needs to keep growing is money. Eventually, Ang hopes to expand to Middle Tennessee. Trezevant Realty Corporation's Brian Estes represented the landlord on the Bartlett lease.
