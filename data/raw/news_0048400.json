Credit Manu Fernandez/Associated Press BARCELONA, Spain — At least 160,000 protesters marched Saturday in Barcelona to demand that Spain’s conservative-led government increase its efforts to take in refugees from war-torn countries like Syria. Spain has accepted just 1,100 refugees of the more than 17,000 it has pledged to take in. Marchers held a large banner and signs with the slogans “Enough Excuses! Take Them In Now!” and “No More Deaths, Open The Borders!” as they made their way through the center of Barcelona to the city’s Mediterranean coast. The police said 160,000 people took part in the march, while organizers said it reached 300,000 participants. In September 2015, Spain’s government pledged to open its doors to 17,337 refugees within two years: 15,888 from camps in Italy and Greece, and 1,449 from Turkey and Libya. On Thursday, a group of 66 refugees — 65 Syrians and one Iraqi — who arrived in Madrid raised the total number of refugees accepted in Spain to 1,100. \nAdvertisement Mayor Ada Colau of Barcelona, a former anti-eviction activist who has pushed Spain’s government to let her city accept more refugees, joined the march.
