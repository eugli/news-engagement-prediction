The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive @HealthWritersUK Conference which is focusing on mental health, and specifically anxiety. pic.twitter.com/JSjbyeSPl3 — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) February 6, 2017 The father of two, who is also a full-time air Ambulance pilot, said his employer contributed to his interest in making mental health help more accessible and less shameful in society. \"My employer, I'm proud to say, knows about the value of normalizing mental health, and treating it with the same respect that we confer on physical health,\" the Duke of Cambridge told the Guild of Health writers. \"This should be the norm.\" William, Kate and Prince Harry formed the charity \"Heads Together\" to break down the barriers surrounding mental health. The charity has partnered with eight mental health organizations to change the conversation on mental health. So many people young and old feel ashamed to discuss the challenges they face. The young royals hope to change that perception through their campaign encouraging young children, teachers and families to open up and seek help without fear of judgment. Each has focused on a different aspect of the disease. William, through his work as an air ambulance pilot and a leading advocate for the homeless, was struck by suicide among men under 40. \"Suicide is the biggest killer of men under 40 in this country. Not cancer , not knife crime, not road deaths — suicide.\" Prince William said in a speech Monday evening. \"If one of these other issues took so many young lives, there would be a national outcry. This silence is killing good people.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:26:27.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
