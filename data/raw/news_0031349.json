The constant follicle changing by the likes of Paul Pogba and Mario Balotelli has become synonymous with the social media age of the game. \nWell, in the United Arab Emirates, the football association (UAEFA) have a very differing view on what players should have on their head. \nIn fact, they have gone full dictator and declared that players must abide by ethical hair guidelines. Yes, you did just read that correctly, rules on how your hair should be presented on a football pitch. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Just imagine if Pogba decided to make the move to the Middle East, he'd never even grace the turf of a pitch. \nHowever, the enforcing of the rule has come into question with one major flaw being discovered by Middle Eastern football website, Ahdaaf. \nAl Wahda's Suhail Al-Mansoori was asked to chop his David Luiz-style mop but Asian footballer of the year, and UAE international, Omar Abdulrahman, who sported a similar style, was not given the same treatment. \nIt will be interesting to see what cut Gyan wears in his next fixture after what is a fiasco totally alien to us in the West. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
