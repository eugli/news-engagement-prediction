ROBERT KITCHIN/FAIRFAX NZ \nMinister of Civil Defence Gerry Brownlee looks at ways to improve Civil Defence command chain. \nDunne said Civil Defence's response to the Port Hills fire in Christchurch last week, and last November's Kaikoura earthquake before that, showed it was \"not up to the mark\". \nREAD MORE: \nIt had been treated \"like a poor relation\" in recent years, with a lack of funding and resources, while the mixture of local and national organisations led to confusion over who called the shots. STACY SQUIRES/FAIRFAX NZ \nCivil Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee, left, and Prime Minister Bill English, right, visit Christchurch to discuss the response to the Port Hills fire. Brownlee has been critical of Civil Defence's current structure. \n\"What happens in reality is it just falls between all the stools - if you've got a good active local council that's got an interest in this stuff, then things happen, [but] if the local council is not particularly interested, then it sort of goes into a black hole.\" \nDunne said the Fire Service already took the lead when it came to emergencies like the Kaikoura earthquake and Christchurch fires, due to its technical equipment, staff capability, and on-ground knowledge. \n\"It's time to front up and say, this is our effective premier emergency management service.\" CHRISTCHURCH CITY COUNCIL/SUPPLIED \nA firefighter dampens down areas affected by the Port Hills fires. \nThe overhaul of the country's fire services, merging urban and rural teams into a single organisation with added responsibilities for emergencies from July this year, could put it in a position to also take on some of Civil Defence's responsibilities, Dunne said. Ad Feedback \n\"Once we get Fire and Emergency New Zealand bedded down, and that will take a year or two in terms of the transition, then i think the next logical thing would be to look about how you graft Civil Defence resources onto that organisation.\" \nDunne said he had had brief, informal discussions about the idea with Brownlee, but would consider a more detailed proposal \"once the dust has settled\" from the Christchurch fire response. \nBrownlee said the proposal was \"an interesting idea\" and would be considered as part of a review, although there had been \"little bits of gaps\" between different fire organisations responding to the Port Hills fires. \n\"From the Government's perspective, we see a need to have a good look at emergency services in New Zealand and how they respond to various emergency situations.\" \nHe did not believe Civil Defence had suffered from a lack of resources, saying it was \"substantially a volunteer organisation\" that was in the hands of local and district councils. \n\"It's never going to be possible to have a standing army of the size that Civil Defence can scale up to.\" \nBrownlee said he would have a better idea of any possible changes to Civil Defence's structure by late March, once officials had a \"fair idea\" of what happened in the Port Hills and an internal review on the Kaikoura earthquake response was completed. \nThere was general agreement that some areas could have been \"sharpened up\", but that did not mean dramatic changes were needed, he said.â€‹ \n\"I wouldn't characterise it as finding out what went wrong, but finding out what could have gone better, and there's quite a gap between those two positions.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:27:07.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
