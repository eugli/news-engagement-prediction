Solve problems. \nThat's what Bessie Coleman Middle School teacher Edward Lie tells his students, instructing them to come up with a problem that someone has to deal with on a daily basis and do something about it. \nFour members of the Cedar Hill school's robotics club took him up on his offer — by inventing a robot cane for the visually impaired that buzzes and vibrates when it comes close to an obstacle. \n\"We all just brainstormed and came up with the idea,\" said team captain Carah Allen, a seventh-grader. \nThe Panopticane — \"panoptic\" means \"being or presenting a panoramic view,\" according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary — vaulted the gotta blast! robotics team to a first-place finish at the regional robotics meet in Richardson in January. The victory earned the team a trip to the state competition this spring. 'A robot seeing-eye dog' \nThe cane, assembled from a Lego robotics kit, includes a motor and sensor that can sense objects from a distance of 50 inches, touchscreen menu and a battery that can be recharged. \n\"Their first idea was a robot seeing-eye dog,\" said Lie (pronounced Lee), a third-year Computer Literacy teacher at Bessie Coleman. \"The more they got into it, it quickly became apparent that the idea was too complicated, but they thought they could still work with that as a foundation.\" \nThe school's robotics club is in its second year, and Carah and fellow seventh-grader Ayzlin Sikes got in on the ground floor. Last year, their invention of the Nag-Bot 2.0 — a trash can that emits a screeching noise when it gets too full — earned the duo a second-place finish at regionals and their first trip to state. Here's a diagram of a robotic cane — called a Panopticane — that vibrates when it gets close to objects. It was designed to help the visually impaired, and it catapulted a Cedar Hill middle school robotics team to the state meet scheduled for late in the 2016-17 school year. (gotta blast! robotics team) \n\"State was heart-lifting because I didn't think we would have a chance to make it,\" Ayzlin said. \"We were mostly in shock at regionals.\" \nThe team didn't fare nearly as well at state last year, \"but that didn't really bother me, because I was looking at two kids who had never so much as touched a robotics kit before they joined the club,\" Lie said. Two more sign up \nNow Carah and Ayzlin — joined at the hip, Lie likes to say — have added eighth-grader Brandon Blanco and sixth-grader Kevin Sulco to the team. \nThe group entered the Panopticane in the intermediate inventions category this year and its main competition came from Village Tech , a charter school in Cedar Hill that sent two teams to regionals. \n\"When they announced the second-place team as Village Tech, we just thought that the other Village Tech team would finish first,\" Carah said. \nBut Brandon quickly shut that thought down. \n\"When we all heard Village Tech's name, Brandon just said, 'Stop thinking negative; think positive,'\" Kevin said. \nBrandon shrugs at the memory. \n\"I just felt confident we were going to win,\" he said. A gateway to STEAM \nLie and Bessie Coleman Principal Jason Miller hope the robotics club serves as gateway to the school's Environmental Science and Engineering Academy, which will open for the 2017-18 school year with 50 students each in the sixth and seventh grades. \nCedar Hill's other middle school, Permenter, will open its Entrepreneurship and Design Academy with the same enrollment numbers and entrance qualifications, which include mandatory parental meetings and interviews. \n\"When you see kids like this, they think outside the box,\" said Miller, who like Lie is in his third year at the school. \"Sometimes they might be frustrated because they question things, and we have to accommodate them. We have to allow them to be risk-takers.\" \nThe middle school programs are part of what Cedar Hill Superintendent Orlando Riddick sees as a burgeoning STEAM plan throughout the district — a Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics regimen that he admits has been slow getting started. Orlando Riddick, who became superintendent of Cedar Hill ISD in 2014, says the district is pursuing an all-encompassing STEAM program that equally embraces the arts and sciences in some capacity at every campus. (DMN File Photo) \n\"At first we were just focusing on the hard math and hard sciences without looking at a total, all-encompassing curriculum,\" said Riddick, also in his third year with the district. \"We had a meeting with parents where we told them what we wanted to prioritize, and one parent stood up and told us we haven't really provided what we said we would. \n\"Well, I own that. I'm here now, so it's my problem. We haven't made the total transformation yet, but that's our ultimate destination.\" \nIt took the gotta blast team two months to construct the Panopticane, with Carah and Brandon handling the programming and Kevin and Ayzlin tackling construction. No one on the team knows anyone with visual difficulties. \n\"Well, I wear glasses,\" Carah said.
