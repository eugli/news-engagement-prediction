ADVERTISEMENT \nAfter eight years of training, she was groomed by North Korean spymasters to conduct the deadly bombing of Korean Air Flight 858, which killed 115 people in 1987. \nThe attack was planned to deter foreign teams from taking part in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. \nShe was only 25 years old when she and her co-conspirator were captured in Bahrain, both of them biting down on cyanide pills to kill themselves rather than being captured. \nShe, however, survived and after her defection, now lives in a secret location in South Korea surrounded by bodyguards for fear of North Korean assassins. \nNot all female agents employed by North Korea are used for violent purposes. It was revealed in 2014 by a former elite North Korean official that the country operated a “seed-bearing programme”. \nIn this scheme, according to a Telegraph report, high-level visitors to Pyongyang would be provided an attractive consort and months later, would be blackmailed by news of a child. \nLeveraging on this blackmail, the North Korean government would demand favourable stories or even business opportunities by targeted journalists and businessmen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:36:13.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
