Story continues below \n“This winter, people have been asking for it. As word got out that sand wasn’t available at the community leagues anymore, I got a number of emails and lots of phone calls about it,” he said. \n“People [were] saying they used the sand to help manage the ice on their sidewalks and particularly since we’ve been seeing more freeze-thaw, freeze-thaw cycles, sidewalks have been a little more difficult to manage for folks.” \nWalters is putting a motion forward at Tuesday’s city council meeting asking for city administration to create a new and improved community sandbox program next winter. \n“People just see it as a useful service. What I’ve asked for is not just to go back to the service that we had. We had, in some cases, some ramshackle boxes with sand that a few people took too much of sometimes,” he said. \n“I’m hopeful [the motion] passes this week and we can get our staff working on something better that actually provides a better service to people. It was one of those things that was an easy, local thing that people could get in their neighbourhood – a little bit of sand that just helps them manage their sidewalks and keep them safe for everybody.” \nSand is now only available at city maintenance yards: Central: 10517 – 95 Street", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:29:24.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
