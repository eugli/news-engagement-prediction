This also gives the show its second best ever week. \nBased largely on Maddow’s performance in the ratings, MSNBC found themselves third among all basic cable channels in primetime viewership. With Fox News sitting at #1 with an average of 2.8 million, MSNBC finished behind TNT and ahead of HGTV, grabbing an average total of 1.6 million viewers for the week in primetime viewership. CNN finished 10th in basic cable primetime. \nAs for total day viewership, the three main cable news networks finished in the top four for all of basic cable, with Fox leading the way and MSNBC and CNN coming in 3rd and 4th, respectively. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:41:00.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
