Sonntag is president and founder of the New Mexico Business Coalition. Courtesy Carla J. Sonntag New Mexico Business Coalition's recent research into a minimum wage hike has determined that it will only hurt our New Mexico businesses and their employees. And if you’re an employer paying above minimum wage and think it won’t affect you, think again. Bills introduced to date in this legislative session would increase wages from $8.40 to as much as $15 an hour from the current state minimum wage of $7.50 an hour. Many of the bills have step increases, and all but one are indexed for annual increases based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Carla J. Sonntag is president and founder of the New Mexico Business Coalition. Courtesy Carla J. Sonntag Over the past 20 years, the CPI has averaged 4.12 percent. In 14 years, that would have increased a proposed $8.50 minimum wage to about $15 an hour, and the proposed $15 wage would be more than $26 an hour. While that might sound good for some employees, let’s consider how this will impact New Mexicans: 1) E mployment. Seventy-seven percent of NMBC survey respondents said a minimum wage increase would increase unemployment. Respondents understand that many New Mexican employers would be forced to adjust to higher wages through layoffs, reduced hours or unfilled positions. 2) Jobs. While initially some employees will benefit from increased pay, others will experience a lack of work or reduced hours. Higher minimum wages usually cause employers to hire fewer low-skilled workers in favor of more high-skilled workers. Who suffers the most from this shift to high-skilled workers? Youth or first-time employees, older adults seeking supplemental income and those who are unable to work at the same capacity as others. 3) E ducation. New Mexico experienced firsthand how the increased minimum wage affected the dropout rate. When Santa Fe increased its minimum wage, the dropout rate increased as young people were lured to the ideal of higher wages. Unfortunately, those lower-skilled workers were passed over, leaving the community’s youth without an education or a job. With New Mexico 49 th in education and saddled with one of the highest dropout rates, we don’t need anything else that will distract our youth from an education. 4) Business tax burden . Businesses have a tax burden above wages paid to employees. To cover Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid taxes, workers' compensation and unemployment insurance taxes, the employer will pay about 10 percent over wages. In addition, employers who provide other benefits such as paid time off, health insurance and retirement are looking at additional costs of 20 percent to as high as 35 percent or more over the required taxes. Using our recent research, a tax burden of 10 percent and additional benefits of 20 percent, a proposed minimum wage of $8.50 an hour would mean a true employer cost of $9.35 to $11.05 per hour. At $15 per hour, that equates to a true cost of $16.50 to $19.50 an hour. 5) Wage ripple effect . An increased minimum wage will force other wages up. Why? Those who have worked to increase their wages through learning the trade, longevity or promotions could be at or below new hire wages. This generally forces employers to increase up-line wages in order to keep seasoned employees, adding additional pressure on employers. 6) Impact on goods and services. Businesses will be forced to raise prices in order to cover increased costs. So while some employees may have increased disposable income, it may not be enough to cover the increased cost of food and services. Those who are on a fixed budget or struggling to get by at the current prices will be the ones most impacted. 7) Impact on taxes. Employers forced to reduce personnel will pay higher unemployment insurance taxes. In addition, as unemployment increases, government assistance will go up, which could cause increased taxes. All of these higher government-forced wages and increased taxes will drive businesses from New Mexico and prevent investment in our great state. No matter how you package it, a minimum wage increase isn't just bad for business and our state's economy; it's bad for the very people we want to help. What's the solution? The free-market system and better education or training. Target, Wal-Mart and others voluntarily increased starting wages in order to attract and maintain better employees. Smaller employers face the same choice as they seek quality employees. Because minimum wage was never meant to be a living wage, employees can improve their opportunities for higher wages by improving their skills and/or education. The New Mexico Business Coalition, as the state partner for the National Association of Manufacturing, is looking for new and innovative ways to bring training and accreditation opportunities in manufacturing to our state. Manufacturing will provide opportunities for both the highly educated technology specialists as well as skilled employees who choose not to pursue higher education. Both types of employees are required in manufacturing. While it may be government’s role to determine taxes and how they are spent, it should not be government’s role to decide what businesses pay employees. We hope that state legislators will recognize that businesses are best equipped to determine fair pay and vote against any government-mandated wage increases.
