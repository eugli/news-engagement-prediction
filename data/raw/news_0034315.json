Photo: Alexander Zemlianichenko/AFP/Getty Images In a move that U.S. officials say violates a major 1987 arms-control treaty, Russia has secretly deployed a cruise missile despite years of objections from the Obama administration, the New York Times is reporting .\nRussia has “two battalions of the prohibited cruise missile,” the Times says. One is still at the nation’s missile test site and the other has been shipped to an unnamed operational base. Russia first appeared to test the missile in 2008 and in 2013, when the State Department raised the issue of a treaty violation with Russian officials. Then, in July 2014, President Obama wrote a letter to Vladimir Putin accusing Russia of violating the 1987 treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces. Signed by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the treaty bans missiles that can fly between 300 and 3,400 miles.\nDespite Obama’s letter, Putin moved forward with the missile, and, now that President Trump is in power, it has been deployed. This must be what Trump was talking about on January 7 when he tweeted , “When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now.”\nTags: vladimir putin president trump russia arms control Russia Deploys Cruise Missile, Violating Arms-Control Treaty Richard Branson Helps Obama Cram 8 Years of Relaxation Into One Vacation NYC’s Bodega Rally Was a Testament to Solidarity and Patriotism 24 Hours at JFK: The Hour-by-Hour Account of Two Iraqis’ Detainment and Release Most Viewed Stories Canadian PM Justin Trudeau Visits the White House, One-ups Trump at the Handshake Game Oklahoma Former Obama White House Photographer’s Instagram Is a Master Class in Shade The Madness of King Donald The The Bachelor Recap: The L-Word Moby, Yes Moby, Claims to Have Secret Intelligence Info on Trump Journalist Claims Omarosa Manigault Threatened Her, Said White House Has ‘Dossier’ on Her ABC Casts Its First Black Bachelorette , Spoils The Bachelor in the Process Psychologists Explain Why Ikea Is a Relationship Death-Trap Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer Guns & Empathy: A Documentary Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 3 mins ago 4 Days Later, Knicks Lift Charles Oakley’s Lifetime Ban NBA commissioner Adam Silver and Michael Jordan brokered a peace deal, but Oakley still wants a public apology.\n4:06 p.m. Kellyanne Conway Quote: -Tweets White Nationalist: ‘Love You Back’ The tweet has since been deleted, and Conway says she doesn’t know who has access to her account.\n3:52 p.m. U.S. Hits Venezuela’s VP With Sanctions for Drug Trafficking Tareck El Aissami has called the act a “vile aggression.”\n3:06 p.m. Russia Deploys Cruise Missile, Violating Arms-Control Treaty Not a great time to be without a national security adviser.\n1:42 p.m. Jury Convicts Man in Nearly 40-Year-Old Etan Patz Murder Case Pedro Hernandez, who confessed to killing the 6-year-old boy in 2012, has been found guilty.\n12:45 p.m. Workers Are Rushing to Fix the Oroville Dam Spillway With More Rain on the Way The crisis has been averted, for now, but crews are rushing to fix an emergency spillway that forced the evacuation of nearly 200,000.\n12:45 p.m. Kim Jong-un’s Brother Killed with Poison Spray at Airport The North Korean leader is accused of ordering the hit.\n12:34 p.m. Michael Flynn’s Resignation Is the Best News of the Trump Presidency So Far The Trump administration just lost its most dangerous Islamophobic conspiracy theorist.\n11:46 a.m. 3 Ways Republicans Are Dodging the Flynn Scandal Does anybody really want to investigate a tedious story about deceit, blackmail, and Russian intrigue?
