Just broke ground on new $1.6 billion #LAX terminal adding 750,000 sq-ft & 12 more gates to our airport. \n— Mayor of Los Angeles (@MayorOfLA) February 27, 2017 \nThe 750,000-square-foot terminal will include 12 gates and a new baggage system, as well as restaurants and shops. It’s scheduled to be completed in 2019. \nGarcetti’s office says construction of the terminal is expected to create 6,000 jobs, produce more than $300 million in direct wages and enable LAX to add flights while relieving congestion at other terminals. \nThe construction is part of a multibillion-dollar modernization of the nation’s third busiest airport. \n(Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
