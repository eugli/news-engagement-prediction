The text read: ‘Incendiary explosive and home-made black powder. More to come.’ He shared a photo of his pipe bomb (Picture: PA) \nAfter being alerted to the disturbing messages, officers found the defendant’s bedroom covered in flags – including the swastika and the symbol of the Waffen SS. They also found a laptop with wallpaper featuring a Nazi eagle over a swastika, and the Nazi phrase ‘Ein Volk, Ein reich, Ein Führer’–‘One Nation, One Empire, One Leader.’ Man with germ phobia loses licence because he won't blow into breathalyser \nThe pipe bomb, found at the teen’s Bradford home on July 26 last year, contained 19g of explosive material the defendant had gathered from sparklers. \n‘It was not made for any lawful purpose,’ Mr Justice Goss said. ‘Precisely what your intention in relation to it was is much more complex.’ \nBut the teenager claimed he never intended to use the pimp bomb, saying he was just ‘fooling around’ with it to see if he could get a reaction out of people. The judge, however, rejected this claim. \n‘You are quite unable to articulate why you are now sorry, and you continue to express very extreme views,’ he said. He sent Nazi-inspired Snapchat messages (Picture: PA) He had praised Jo Cox’s killer Thomas Mair (Picture: PA) \nThe court heard how he had embarked on a journey of reading which took him from Trotskyism to Stalinism to anarchism, then back to Stalinism, and then he discovered National Socialism – aka Nazism – at the beginning of 2016. Dog owners are more sexually attractive than people who own cats \nAfter this the teen became associated with National Action, which became a proscribed terrorist group in December 2016 and was described in court as ‘a small, secretive neo-Nazi British youth nationalist organisation’. \nAs the teen had already served the equivalent of a 14-month-long sentence on remand, he was giving him a Youth Rehabilitation Order with a number of stipulations – including an internet ban. \nThe judge said the Youth Rehabilitation Order would last for three years, and would involve the teenager being supervised, attending a preventative intervention programme for a year, staying off the internet and not contacting any proscribed groups.
