Manny Crisostomo The Sacramento Bee 1 of 4 \nBy Matt Barrows SANTA CLARA \nQuarterback Colin Kaepernick, who for the second straight year faces a murky offseason, met head coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch at team headquarters Wednesday for what Lynch said on a KNBR radio interview was a \"really a positive discussion.\" \nKaepernick is the only quarterback currently under contract with the 49ers for the 2017 season. However, he's due to earn a little less than $15 million in base salary alone and the team can cut him with little penalty. Likewise, Kaepernick can get out of the deal as early as next week and enter free agency a week after that. \nKaepernick has been living with his girlfriend, radio personality Nessa Diab, in his New York apartment and recently sold his San Jose home. He parted ways with his longtime agents earlier this month and has not yet hired a replacement. Kaepernick was on his way back to New York Wednesday afternoon. \nLynch declined to divulge any specifics about the conversation, saying only that the participants “left excited.” He characterized the team’s evaluation of Kaepernick is \"still very much fluid.\" \n“We’ve only been on the job a couple weeks,\" Lynch said. \"I can tell you, we both really very much being around Colin, and he seems like he’s in a real good place.” \nLynch, Shanahan and Kaepernick had conversed over the phone and through text messages in recent weeks, and Lynch already was familiar with the quarterback after meeting him several times in Lynch’s former job as a television broadcaster. \nKaepernick has said in the past that he does not intend to opt out of his contract and is open to playing with the 49ers for the upcoming season. The 49ers, however, could force his hand by telling him they plan to release him instead of pay him his 2017 contract. \nThat, in turn, almost would compel him to enter free agency. \nOne of the scenarios at play is that the 49ers release him and then end up signing him to a more modest deal. After all, they could turn out to be his best chance to win a starting job. \nA year ago, Kaepernick tried to engineer a trade but found only two serious suitors, the Browns and Broncos. The quarterback decided against Cleveland after seeing the Browns let go of some of their better free agents, and he did not like the pay cut the Broncos wanted him to take. It's not known whether those teams will remain options for him this offseason. \nKaepernick took over the 49ers starting job from Blaine Gabbert this past season after five weeks. He finished with 16 touchdown passes against four interceptions and a 90.7 passer rating, his highest mark since the 2013 season. \nThe three other quarterbacks who were on San Francisco's 2016 roster -- Gabbert, Christian Ponder and Thad Lewis -- will be unrestricted free agents next month. So will a couple of quarterbacks Shanahan has worked with in the past, Chicago's Brian Hoyer and Atlanta's Matt Schaub. \nThe 49ers also have been linked to Washington free agent Kirk Cousins, who could get the franchise tag from his team, and New England's Jimmy Garoppolo, for whom they would have to trade. \nSan Francisco has the No. 2 overall pick in the draft. The top three quarterbacks are believed to be Clemson's Deshaun Watson, North Carolina's Mitch Trubisky and Notre Dame's DeShone Kizer, although one or more of them could fall into the second round. \nMatt Barrows: @mattbarrows , read more about the team at sacbee.com/sf49ers .
