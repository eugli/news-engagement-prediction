He attracts more admiring glances than his friend Mr Bingley, who is described as “good looking and gentlemanlike”. However, with a typically sardonic flourish, Austen writes: “Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.” \nCasting directors have generally interpreted this as tall, dark and ruggedly handsome, personified by Colin Firth in the famous wet shirt 1995 television version. Indeed the screenwriter Andrew Davies recently revealed that Firth was forced to dye his naturally reddish brown hair a darker shade for the role.

They do permit him strong muscular legs, toned by horse-riding and fencing, as a desirable attribute. \nThe ideal for gentlemanly good looks in Austen’s day, they believe, was a smooth youthful complexion, with a small pointy chin and small mouth, under hair worn long but tied back and powdered white, as seen in many aristocratic portraits. \nVickery says of their version of the character: “As Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice in the 1790s, our Mr Darcy portrayal reflects the male physique and common features at the time. Men sported powdered hair, had narrow jaws, and muscular, defined legs were considered very attractive. A stark contrast to the chiselled, dark, brooding Colin Firth portrayal we associate the character with today.” \nSutherland believes the enigma is part of Darcy’s charm: “There are only scraps of physical description of Fitzwilliam Darcy to be found in Pride and Prejudice; he is our most mysterious and desirable leading man of all time. What’s fantastic about Jane Austen’s writing is that Mr Darcy is both of the era and timeless.” \nVarious historical figures have been suggested as Austen’s model for Darcy, including an Irish law student Tom Lefroy – later a judge and MP – with whom she is said to have had a brief youthful romantic attachment. Others believe he was based on the first Earl of Morley, John Parker, married to a friend of the author’s. The truth may have been lost in the many letters her sister Cassandra burned after her death. \nThe research on the real Mr Darcy was commissioned by Drama Channel to launch their Jane Austen season, which starts on Valentine’s Day.
