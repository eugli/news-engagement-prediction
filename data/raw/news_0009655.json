Booze news: national alcohol monopoly Alko wants to stay open later. Image: Ismo Pekkarinen / AOP \nAlko, the Finnish alcohol monopoly, is proposing several-hour extensions to its opening hours year round, including extended hours on the eves of national holidays. \nThe proposal is part of a bill draft on a full reform of the Alcohol Act, begun in early 2016. \nAlko justifies the proposal by citing the extended opening hours of other shops following a law change a year ago. As a result, supermarkets may sell alcoholic beverages until 9 pm every day, whereas Alko closes much earlier and is not open on Sundays at all. \nThe comprehensive reform draft proposes a one-hour extension – from 8 pm to 9 pm – to Alko opening hours on weekdays (Mon-Fri). \nIn addition, Alko proposes a three-hour extension to Saturday availability, bringing closing time to 9 pm instead of 6 pm. \nThe monopoly also proposes being open until 9 pm on the evenings preceding New Year's Day, Vappu (Apr 30), Midsummer (mid-July) and Independence Day (Dec 6). On Christmas Eve Alko wants its shops to be open until 1 pm. \n\"The liberalised opening hours have altered consumer behaviour, so that having Alko close at noon on some holidays comes as a surprise to many of our customers,\" the release reads. \"Opening hours should be consistent for the sake of purchasing habits and customer feedback.\" \nAlko announces it wants to remain closed on the days proper of national holidays. \nAfter the circulation for comments, the proposal will be finalised and submitted to the Finnish Council of Regulatory Impact Analysis for evaluation. After this, the government proposal for the new Alcohol Act will be submitted to parliament. The entry into force of the Alcohol Act will be decided on during a parliamentary session.
