Home to the cheap and cheerful, it includes well-known franchises as well as the first full-concept outposts for Four Frogs Creperie, Messina and Zumbo. Sweet darling Zumbo at Gateway will be a definite crowd-pleaser.

I’m glad to see her remembered, and proud to officially launch this great new space.” Circular Quay is set for significant revitalisation in coming years.
