However, over the past one year, the stock has reversed its laggard status, rallying 350% and outperforming the BSE SmallCap index's rally of nearly 39%. \n\nRecently, another well known investor, Ashish Kacholia has taken fancy to the stock, picking up a 2% stake at an aver age price of Rs 224.6 a share. On Tuesday , the stock closed at Rs 240.30. \n\nA new management, shift in business strategy and improved earnings over the last two quarters after several quarters of flat or shrinking profit growth are prompting fresh investor interest in the stock. \n\n“Anil Pant came in as CEO last year and the change in focus to employment-driven enrolment has given comfort and scope that things can turn around.Earlier, it was just a computer education institute,“ said Purvesh Shelatkar, senior VP (institutional equities), Centrum Broking, which organised a meeting of the company with top investors such as SBI MF, HDFC MF, Invesco MF, HSBC MF , Tata MF and Goldman Sachs Asset Management earlier this month.Currently, institutional holding in Aptech is negligible. \n\nKacholia's stake purchase comes on the heels of investors, led by Jhunjhunwala, purchasing 16 lakh shares of Aptech in August-September last year, taking the total promoter holding to 49.3% from 45.3%. GS Damani owns 3.15% in the company . \n\nJhunjhunwala first picked up 10% in Aptech in 2005 at Rs 56 per share and has gradually raised holding, though in 2011, it was reported that he was looking to sell his stake in Aptech. The deal could not go through because he was asking for a valuation of Rs 700 crore, over three times the company's annual revenues. \n\nIn the December quarter, the company's consolidated net profit soared 173.5% from a year ago to `7.5 crore and margins improved 19.1% from 16.7%, while in the September quarter, the profit jumped 160.7% over the previous year. \n\nShelatkar said fixed costs for Aptech are low as it operates on a franchisee basis. The stock is a good buy near the `150170 levels and has potential to double in three years. However, others said one needs to see if earnings sustain and that valuations are high. “Fundamentals are missing. So the share price is not justified,“ said a Mumbai-based investment advisor. The stock is far from its lifetime high of `448.5 that it hit in 2007.
