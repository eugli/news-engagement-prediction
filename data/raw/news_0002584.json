The Northwest Indiana Federation of Interfaith Organizations organized the rally with the Children of Abraham, a combination several mosques, churches and synagogues working together send medical supplies to those in need around the world. \nOmar Estwani, secretary of the board for the Northwest Islamic Center in Crown Point, said he is a first generation Syrian who was born and raised in America, but met his wife in Syria. He said when he asked her to marry him and come to the U.S., he promised her America is the land of the free and her rights will always be protected here. The events since Friday initially made him feel he broke that promise. His wife is now questioning if she will ever see her parents again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:23:16.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
