(Manchester United) Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has shown his support for the now former Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri in a post on social media. Source: Tweet \nAfter news of the Italian's sacking was made public on Friday (AEDT), Ranieri was quick to receive the support of his peers, led by the Manchester United boss. \nHaving produced one of the most remarkable accomplishments in sporting history by winning the Premier League last season, the club's management thought change was needed with the Foxes sitting just a point above relegation. \nMourinho - who succeeded Ranieri at Chelsea in 2004 - paid tribute to his counterpart in an Instagram post on social media. \n\"CHAMPION OF ENGLAND and FIFA MANAGER of THE YEAR.sacked,\" Mourinho wrote. \n\"That's the new football Claudio. Keep smiling AMICO. Nobody can delete the history you wrote.\" \nFormer England international Gary Lineker was among other prominent footballing figures who expressed their shock at Leicester's decision. After all that Claudio Ranieri has done for Leicester City, to sack him now is inexplicable, unforgivable and gut-wrenchingly sad. \n— Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) February 23, 2017 \nRanieri leaves Leicester with the side sitting in 17th position on the Premier League table, while assistant manager Craig Shakespeare and first-team coach Mike Stowell have been appointed to lead the team until a permanent manager is appointed. Ranieri’s sacking a shameful, senseless act The odds of Leicester City winning the Premier League last season are well-known: 5000-1. You could have practically written the same odds for the Foxes sacking Claudio Ranieri this season.
