Her husband, film director Georg Jacoby, whom she met on the set of Kora Terry, is thought to have spied along with her.

However, she was banned from acting for two years after the war because of her association with the Nazi regime. \nRokk performed in over 35 films before her death in Austria in 2004. \nIn 1951, the star said she had decided to give up acting to open a knitwear shop, but the intelligence report says this was simply a “clever cover-up” for spying.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:05:36.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
