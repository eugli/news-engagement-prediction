Bush administration.\n“It has been an honor to take on the responsibility of the position of First Lady, with its long history as an important representative of the President, our family, and the traditions of our nation around the world,” FLOTUS said in the statement.\n“I am putting together a professional and highly-experienced team which will take time to do properly. I am excited to be organizing and bringing together such a dynamic and forward thinking group of individuals who will work together to make our country better for everyone.”\nTrump has yet to formally announce her platform of official causes or a social schedule of events.\n“I look forward to the opportunity to serve as the First Lady’s Chief of Staff,” said Reynolds. “The First Lady is thoughtfully selecting her team, establishing the Office of the First Lady and supporting her husband President Trump.”\nThe hire comes on the same day as not only the speculation about the first lady’s whereabouts — she hasn’t been seen in public in 12 days — but also first daughter Ivanka Trump stepping out with her father Donald Trump in a traditional first lady role — escorting the president to meet the remains of a returning fallen serviceman.\nAlso on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the first lady shut down rumors Trump would not be moving to the White House.\n“Mrs. Trump will be moving to D.C. and settling in to the White House at the end of the school year, splitting her time between New York and D.C. in the meantime,” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, acting as senior adviser to the first lady, confirmed to CNN .\n“Mrs. Trump is honored to serve this country and is taking the role and responsibilities of first lady very seriously. It has only been a short time since the inauguration and the first lady is going to go about her role in a pragmatic and thoughtful way that is unique and authentic to her,” said Wolkoff.\nIn November, the president confirmed the news that Melania and their son Barron would continue to reside at their Trump Tower penthouse in N.Y.C. until the 10-year-old finishes the school year.\nShow Full Article", "external_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/melania-trump-flotus-where-is-she/"], "published": "2017-02-02T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:40:08.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
