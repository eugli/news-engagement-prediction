I’ve had the device for a year now, and it was one of the best decisions I ever made.\nIt’s not what you think Although the S7 Edge has a great set of hardware housed in a sleek case, these features are not exclusive to Samsung.\nApple, Huawei, and LG all sell beautiful and powerful phones in South Africa.\nEven features such as its IP68 dust and waterproof ratings are not unique.\nIt must also be noted that while I think Samsung offers the best overall package in South Africa, its devices are not perfect.\nThere are always trade-offs when making phones. For example, the Galaxy S7 does not have a removable battery or a dual-camera system, and it doesn’t have my favourite implementation of a fingerprint reader.\nTaking that into account, however, it is hard to beat the Samsung-Android combination – for the reasons below.\nAccessories and VR support As Samsung is such a popular brand, you can always find accessories that fit your phone.\nScreen protectors, covers, and battery cases are readily available in South Africa.\nVR support is also included with the S7, and the Samsung Gear VR is a relatively cheap headset (if you discount the cost of the phone).\nSamsung devices compatible with Gear VR include the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, and the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, and S6 Edge+.\nService centres After-sales support is not something many people consider when buying a phone, until it’s too late and they wish they had.\nWhen something goes wrong and you need to get your phone repaired, you will be glad that Samsung’s footprint across South Africa is expansive.\nAccidental damage warranty No list of Samsung smartphone pros would be complete without the accidental damage from handling warranty (ADH).\nADH is an additional warranty on flagship Samsung phones that offers a free screen or rear glass repair.\nThe ADH warranty that comes with the S7 offers one free cracked glass repair within the first 12 months of the date of purchase.\nThe Android connection Having a good piece of hardware, customer support, and accessories all fall away if you have a terrible OS, and Android is an essential part of Samsung’s success.\nBlackBerry had arguably the greatest value proposition of any smartphone in South Africa for years, but that didn’t stop the decline of its devices running the BlackBerry OS.\nLike Samsung’s hardware, Android is not perfect. Of particular concern are worryingly-infrequent software updates on most networks.\nAndroid’s niggles are swept away by its rich set of features, though.\nMulti-window Android 7.0 Nougat has added a “multiple app windows” feature to its functionality, while Samsung has had this standout feature on its devices for a while.\nHome screen and app tray Samsung devices come with a 4×4 home screen and app tray grid size, which means you can fit 16 icons on a single screen.\nThis can be adjusted to a 4×5 or 5×5 grid size – a feature that isn’t available on all Android-based smartphones.\nWidgets Android has several features you won’t find on iOS, including an app tray that is separate from the home screens and the ability to add dynamic widgets and not just app icons to home screens.\nSamsung’s software also includes widgets you won’t find on default Android, such as a full-month calendar widget.\nData usage tracker A feature I use a lot is Android’s mobile data usage tracker and limiter.\nThis allows you to prevent out-of-bundle usage or being cut off by your service provider for reaching your cap.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:57:40.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
