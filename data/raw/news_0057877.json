And its aggressive effort to harness the power of its huge number of stores with its online business is starting to take form. \n“We're moving with speed to become more of a digital enterprise and better serve our customers,” Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in a statement. \nLast year, Wal-Mart spent more than $3 billion for Jet.com in a deal aimed at helping it attract younger and more affluent customers. \nRead more: Why Wal-Mart would want to buy e-commerce start-up Jet.com » \nSince then, it bought online footwear retailer ShoeBuy.com for $70 million and the outdoor and gear seller Moosejaw for $51 million. These sites are operating as standalone sites. Last year, Wal-Mart also raised its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site. \nMarc Lore, the Jet.com founder who is now CEO of Walmart.com, said Tuesday that the company is still looking for new start-ups to buy. Under Lore, the company has quadrupled the number of items available on its third-party online marketplace to more than 35 million. \nWal-Mart said it's working to accelerate the integration between Walmart.com and Jet.com, and trying to take advantage of its scale in areas like shipping and sharing its product selection. \nMoving closer to the terms of Amazon's powerhouse Prime program, Wal-Mart is now offering free two-day shipping on online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Amazon Prime costs $99 a year, but it comes with services such as streaming music and video. \nWal-Mart executives said Tuesday that shoppers are responding well to the two-day shipping program. In a move to rival Wal-Mart's latest tactic, Amazon, however, quietly posted on its website over the weekend that it was dropping threshold for free shipping for non-Prime members to $35 from $50. But that applies to standard shipping of five to eight days, not two-day delivery. \nBesides melding its online and store businesses so shoppers can jump back and forth, Wal-Mart has launched changes designed to make its stores cleaner and its customer service friendlier and faster. The company has invested $2.7 billion in higher wages and training for workers, a move that it says has helped to lower turnover and improve customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:53:56.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
