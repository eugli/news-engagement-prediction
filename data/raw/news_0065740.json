I wasn’t the type of kid to throw tantrums, but that was the one thing I was super passionate about.” \nFlash forward 17 years, and that passion burns just as brightly today, with De Haitre one of three Canadians taking part in this weekend’s ISU World Sprint Speed Skating Championships in Calgary. (Also on the Canadian team are Laurent Dubreuil, of Levis, Que., and Winnipeg’s Heather McLean.) \nDe Haitre is also a world-class track cyclist, having represented Canada at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. He has designs on becoming the next Clara Hughes by competing in both sports at the Olympics. \nA lofty goal? Absolutely. But De Haitre is one of those ridiculously talented athletes with the potential to win at both the Winter and Summer Games. Le May Doan hopes to see her record fall soon \nSpeed skater Catriona Le May Doan retired from speed skating way back in 2003, but she remains the Canadian record holder in the 500 metres. \nLe May Doan, 46, hopes to bid farewell to her title this weekend at the ISU World Sprint Speed Skating Championships in Calgary. \nRising star Heather McLean, of Winnipeg, will have two shots at beating Le May Doan’s mark of 37.22 seconds, set way back in 2001, on what is deemed the fastest ice in the world at the Olympic Oval. \n“It’s time,” Le May Doan says. “It’s always hard to see a record go, but my goodness, it’s been 16 years. Records are made to be broken. It’s made me happy to hold the record for so long, but it’s made me sad. I want our sport to be growing. The whole purpose of our sport is speed, so let’s get those records and let’s get people going faster.” \nMcLean’s personal best is 37.34 seconds set on Jan. 5, 2016. She is coming off a fifth-place finish in 37.86 seconds on the slower ice at the world single distance championships in Gangneung, South Korea. \n“Heather is such a talent,” Le May Doan said. “She’s right on track. And it’s about patience. It’s about persistence. She’s such a hard worker. She’s got such a bright future.” \nMcLean, 24, hopes the future is now. \n“I definitely want to focus on the execution of my race, but the record is something that’s been a dream of mine since I was young,” McLean said. “So I’m definitely going to go for it.” \n— Vicki Hall \n“It’s lucky for us that he’s chosen to focus on speed skating, but I think he might shift to cycling for a couple years after these Olympics,” says speed skating coach Bart Schouten. “I think he’ll be great in cycling, too. Vince has got the right body — with the legs and the butt — to be a really good speed skater. He’s very strong, but very smart and very composed for a 22-year-old.” \nSome of that composure comes from De Haitre’s early exposure to the highest level of speed skating. He simply carries himself with confidence beyond his years — much like an NHL player who cracked the big league straight out of junior. \nMuch to his own surprise, De Haitre earned a spot on the Canadian Olympic team at age 18, competing alongside stars such as Denny Morrison, Sven Kramer and Ireen Wust. His results proved unspectacular, with a 20th-place finish in the 1,000 metres and 33rd in the 1,500 metres. But De Haitre looked at the experience as a crash course in how to succeed in speed skating. \nBuilding on those lessons, he won bronze at the World Cup final in 2015 and then captured his first World Cup gold at a 2016 stop in Kazakhstan. \nDe Haitre cemented his status as a legitimate medal contender for the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, with a silver medal at the 2017 world championships in the 1,000 metres. He also finished fourth at the world championships in the 1,500 metres, signalling his podium potential in multiple events. \nCalgary might be the epicentre of long-track speed skating in Canada, but both De Haitre and 2016 world champion Ivanie Blondin are products of the Gloucester Concordes in suburban Ottawa. \n“I saw Ivanie on the ice in her Canada colours, and it gave me a good sense of what it takes and how good you need to be to achieve certain goals,” De Haitre said. “But with our age difference, it was kind of hard to be friends. No 16-year-old girl wants to have a 12-year-old friend.” \nThese days, De Haitre and Blondin are not only friends — they’re actually two of Canada’s top medal contenders for 2018. \nThe next step for De Haitre comes Saturday and Sunday at the Olympic Oval, where he will toe the line in two 500-metre races and two 1,000-metre races for the title of fastest man in the world.
