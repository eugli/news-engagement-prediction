Against this backdrop, the Supreme Court observing that data that exposes any lacunae of the judicial system is not tantamount to contempt is a welcome step forward in self-rectification. A subordinate court in Jammu & Kashmir had, suo motu, initiated contempt proceedings against the heads of Transparency International (India) and the Centre for Media Studies—the two organisations had jointly carried out a survey on judicial corruption which showed that the judiciary was widely perceived to be corrupt by the public. The SC first pointed to a technical issue, in that subordinate courts do not have the power to issue contempt warrants, but have to refer the matter to the High Court.\nWhat the SC bench, headed by the Chief Justice, said while doing so was even more important. According to a report in The Indian Express, the bench asked “How do you understand society? You … ask people in the society …what is their perception of a particular institution or an issue. Where will research go if this is contempt?… Are you saying that if there is a malady, whether it is expediting a case or delaying it, and other such acts, should we close our eyes?”\nYou May Also Want To Watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T09:21:20.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
