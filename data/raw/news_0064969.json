It is a pity to see such a small and extreme group denying academic thought, exploration and discussion from an Irish audience, but unfortunately, these are the bullying, intimidating tactics of the BDS movement,\" continued Nahshon. \n\"We are sure that an esteemed university such as Trinity will take the appropriate measures to deal with the instigators of last night's protest. We expect the Irish authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure the freedom of speech of Israel's ambassador.\" \nIn an interview to the Irish Times , Irish4Israel chairman Barry Williams described the protest as “hysterical behavior from certain segments of students.\" \n“Every time this happens we end up getting more supporters for Israel,” he continued. “People end up getting so frustrated, they actually start to investigate more.
