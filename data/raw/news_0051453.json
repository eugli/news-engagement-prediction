Vladimir Putin's d---?\" \n\"But let's be real here,\" Colbert continued. \"This is the President of the United States. He has access to every and the latest intel at all times. Sir, for real, where did you get your information from?\" \nColbert then put up a tweet Trump sent out following the Friday rally saying that he got the information from watching Fox News. \n\"Oh, I guess Trump only accepts intelligence reports with the logo, 'As seen on TV,'\" Colbert said. \n\"Tragically, Sweden is the third not a terrorist attack that has not shocked the world in the last month,\" Colbert said to end his opening. \"First, there wasn't the Bowling Green Massacre, then no one was lost in Atlanta, and now it's not Sweden's turn. When will it begin?\" \nColbert then played a tribute video to those who did not suffer, which included Swedish Fish, ABBA, and Ikea. \nWatch the entire Colbert opening below: \n- Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) February 19, 2017 \nMy statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:47:21.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
