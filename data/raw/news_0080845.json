Depression can be a lonely illness (Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for Metro.co.uk) \nBut my oldest friends were there for me throughout, and I’ll never, ever forget that and I can never thank them enough. \nCraig, my oldest friend who I met at nursery, has been there to pick me up when I’ve been let down, when I’ve been dumped, when I’ve been angry, when I’ve been dumped, when I’ve been hurt, when I’ve been dumped (you get the picture). \nHe was there for me as my Best Man on my wedding day. Craig (left) and Matthew (Picture: Matthew Williams) \nHe was also there when I wondered how I could face another day, when getting out of bed was the limit of my achievements, when the chatty, fun Matthew was replaced by one for whom smiling was an impossibility. \nHe was there every week to take me out and just be there, reminding me of who I really was beneath the illness and letting me know that somebody believed in me, and that however bad things were I could always count on him being in my corner. Craig's advice for helping a friend with depression \n‘I really struggled to know whether I was helping or not during his really dark times, but now I know that I did (because he has told me!). \nFor me, it was just about spending time with him, going for a coffee or a drink, letting him talk and get things of his chest. \nI think he knows me well enough to know that I would not judge him no matter what.’ \nSimon has been my friend since I asked him whether he was a boy or a girl on our first day of primary school. \nA man so popular it’s only a matter of time before he has a lounge named after him in his local (or a poker table at least). \nAt times over the years I’ve lost touch with him as our lives took us in different directions and to different places, but we are always able to pick up our friendship as if we’d never been away. \nHe’s the friend that took me out to play darts every week during my second illness even though his Dad was terminally ill. Matthew (left) and Simon (Picture: Matthew Williams) \nAt a time when others less understanding could have – and maybe would have – thought, ‘what have YOU got to be depressed about?’, he was there, giving me brief respite from my waking nightmare whilst reminding me that ‘trebles are for show but doubles are for dough’. \nIt’s hard to overstate just how much their support meant to me. Simon's advice for helping a friend with depression \n‘I’d suggest bringing up things from your own personal life that the person may not know. \nIt doesn’t have to be anything major – but being a bit more open about things, especially as a man, can often encourage a good friend to do the same. \nYou never know when that moment may come when they just need to talk to you, or share something with you. \nThe more open you are with them, the more likely they will be to confide in you rather than keep it hidden away.’ \nOne thing that mental illness teaches you (or taught me at least) is just how much inner strength and resource you have, but in the midst of it nothing could seem further from the truth. First aid but not as you know it: 6 simple ways to support someone with mental health issues \nBetween them, my friends reminded me that my illness wasn’t me, that I had a lot to offer and would one day be me again, and that just for an hour or two I could escape from my broken mind and focus on the ‘now’ of a pub quiz or throwing a dart. \nIt is only from the safety of recovery that I can truly appreciate just how much of a difference their support made to me. \nIt helped me to recover at a time when recovery didn’t seem possible. \nThere is so much stigma and misunderstanding that surrounds mental illness and this is acutely felt when you are in its fog. \nFor men in particular it can be difficult to admit to, especially when ‘being a man’ is associated with being strong and tough. \nMen aren’t ‘supposed’ to admit they need help from anybody, whether it’s for putting a shelf up or admitting that your life is falling apart around you and that you’re scared and you can’t cope. \nSometimes we can’t admit this to ourselves, but what we can all do is look out for our friends and be there for them when they are struggling. \nWe need to notice when they’re not quite themselves and could use a mate in their corner.
