Tennessee senior guard Robert Hubbs (Photo: Randy Sartin, USA TODAY Sports) \nThat disappointment hadn’t diminished by Friday afternoon, and Hubbs said he cares much more about Saturday’s pivotal game at South Carolina than he does about any individual accomplishment. \n“I mean, it’s a great achievement, I guess, but it really doesn’t mean anything,” Hubbs said. “We lost the game that night, so, I mean, it really doesn’t matter to me. I’m just playing basketball.” \nHubbs said the way this season — and therefore his college career — ends will determine how excited he’ll ultimately be about his 1,000-point production. \nThe 6-foot-5 senior said he was just thankful Wednesday wasn’t the final game of his Tennessee career. \nPut simply, Hubbs isn’t in the mood to reflect right now. \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .) \n“I don’t really know if (scoring 1,000 points) is something to be joyful about. I mean, I guess,” he said. \nHubbs said his focus remains on Saturday’s game — a game at South Carolina (20-8, 10-5 SEC) that could put Tennessee (15-13, 7-8) back into the NCAA Tournament picture. \n“We’ve just got to go out there and do what we do,” said Hubbs, who leads the Vols at 14.3 points per game. “We still have a lot at stake right now, so we’ve got to go out there and execute and do what we do and hopefully come out with a win.” \nThe Vols and Gamecocks are scheduled to tip at 1:01 p.m. Eastern in a Saturday game that will be broadcast by SEC Network. \n\nContact Wes Rucker by email at wesrucker247@gmail.com or ON TWITTER , or FOLLOW GOVOLS247 ON FACEBOOK .
