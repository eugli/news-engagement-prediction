The singer confessed that even though time seemed to pass quickly, the amount of work she put into her career actually made time go by rather slowly. \nWhile she admitted that she had no particular emotion about her debut anniversary, she did have pretty frank things to say about getting older. \n“Right now I am 39 and only a year away from turning 40 (Korean age), but I don’t really notice it. I still feel like I’m in my 20s, and there’s so much that I still want to do. However, I think about how I am already turning 40, and I feel a little regret,” she expressed with a laugh. \nAging also makes Lee Hyori feel less pressure to fit a certain image. In the interview, the singer joked that no one really expects her to be “pretty as a flower” anymore. \n“There are already so many beautiful, flower-like celebrities. I used to be like them, but it seems like these days no one really expects me to be this young beauty. I want to be a warm mentor people can talk to or an older sister instead.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:40:37.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
