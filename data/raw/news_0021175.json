What a lucky break. In fact, it was also a poor throw from Kamrul Islam Rabbi, the fielder who dived and caused the uncertainty.

Good call as there was an inside edge. \n10:56 hrs IST : Shakib Al Hasan, Bangladesh’s greatest, comes into the attack now. Can he break this dangerous stand? \n10:51 hrs IST : Bangladesh are losing their discipline. Kamrul bowls a short and wide ball outside off and Vijay crashes the cut to deep backward point. 10 runs again in the over and India have moved to 65/1 in 16 overs. \n10:48 hrs IST : Runs are flowing easily now. Both Vijay and Pujara have got their eye in. Cheteshwar Pujara and Murali Vijay strung a solid partnership to revive India against Bangladesh. (BCCI) \n10:45 hrs IST: Edged and safe again !

Mehedi gets this delivery to dip on Pujara and the batsman stabs at it, the ball goes wide of Shakib at slip for a boundary. \n10:39 hrs IST : Superb shot from Pujara.

Mehedi Hasan, who was a sensation in the series against England, comes into the attack. \n10:30 hrs IST : Kamrul bowls an expensive over as Vijay finds the boundary again with a crunching pull shot to deep mid wicket. 10 runs in the over and the first hour ends. Even for the moment, but slight advantage to India. \n10:28 hrs IST : Runs are starting to come very easily. Kamrul bowls a short ball on leg stump and Vijay pulls it to the long leg boundary. India making a move on. Taskin Ahmed bowled an impressive spell as he picked up the wicket of KLRahul in the one-off Test between India vs Bangladesh. (BCCI) \n10:26 hrs IST : The crowd are slowly filtering in. Not much on the first day yet. Sarkar ends the over poorly as Pujara clips a full ball on the pads to the deep mid wicket fence. India 30/1 after 12 overs . Catch live updates of the match here. \n10:22 hrs IST : Change in bowling first up. Soumya Sarkar is bowling! Remember, he does bowl fast medium. He gets some away swing but not close enough for Pujara to play. Pace is somewhere in the mid-120s . \n10:18 hrs IST: Edged but safe ! Kamrul bowls a full ball in the channel outside off and gets a slight hint of away shape, Pujara pokes at it softly and the edge lands in front of first slip. Maybe, slip is also standing a bit too deep. \n10:16 hrs IST : Impressive spell from Taskin so far. 5-0-11-1 . He has bowled with good pace and has troubled the batsman with some swing and bounce. \n10:12 hrs IST: First boundary for Vijay. Kamrul Islam strays a short ball on leg stump and Vijay pulls it to fine leg. India 24/1 after eight overs . Catch live updates of the match here. Taskin Ahmed struck early as he removed KLRahul cheaply in the one-off Test between India vs Bangladesh in Hyderabad. (BCCI) \n10:06 hrs IST : This has been a good show from Bangladesh so far. However, their captain, Mushfiqur Rahim has wanted more Tests in overseas conditions. \n10:04 hrs IST : Good ball from Taskin. He gets some late inswing to Pujara and the batsman is almost beaten for pace, he gets a leading edge to point and there is some confusion over whether to take a single, in the end, they decide against it. \n10:00 hrs IST: The first boundary of the Test match. Full and wide delivery from Kamrul outside off, Pujara reaches out slightly and carves it past gully for a boundary. Much needed for India. \n09:55 hrs IST : Good line and lengths from Taskin and Kamrul. They are not giving away much as India move to 7/1 after 5 overs . Taskin is employing the short-ball well and is touching close to 90 mph. Catch live updates of the match here. Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara made sluggish progress after KLRahul departed cheaply. (BCCI) \n09:50 hrs IST : Both Vijay and Pujara have gotten off the mark with a couple. Kamrul Islam Rabbi has a good round-arm action and he could be lethal with reverse swing when the ball becomes old. \n09:46 hrs IST : Strange appeal from Bangladesh. Taskin gets a full ball to swing well down the leg side and Rahim dives to his left to collect, they appeal for a catch, the bat was miles away from the ball. What were they appealing for? India are 4/1 after three overs . \n09:40 hrs IST : Good start from Kamrul Islam Rabbi. Wicket-to-wicket and a bit of swing. Bangladesh not showing any nerves. \n09:35 hrs IST: WICKET! KLRahul b Taskin Ahmed 2/1, 0.4 overs vs Bangladesh . \nFull ball outside off, Rahul goes for the drive and gets an inside edge that clatters on to middle stump. \n09:30 hrs IST : Murali Vijay and KLRahul have come out to open. Taskin Ahmed will open the bowling. \n09:27 hrs IST : The national anthems of Bangladesh and India are done. Time for action. \n09:20 hrs IST : Jayant Yadav has been left out and India have gotten three pacers in the team. Pretty strange. The Hyderabad wicket has a nice even covering of grass. So there will be some movement for the pacers and some nice carry too \n09:14 hrs IST : Some strange decisions and some unfortunate decisions from the Indian camp. Karun Nair, who blasted 303* in the Chennai Test, is left out for Ajinkya Rahane. Kohli had said that Rahane’s two years of hard work cannot be overlooked due to one knock. Virat Kohli won the toss and chose to bat as Bangladesh arrived in India for their first-ever Test. (BCCI) \n09:08 hrs IST: Playing XIs of both India and Bangladesh: \nIndia : Murali Vijay, Lokesh Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli(c), Ajinkya Rahane, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma \nBangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mominul Haque, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Sabbir Rahman, Mehedi Hasan, Taijul Islam, Taskin Ahmed, Kamrul Islam Rabbi \n09:05 hrs IST: Mushfiqur Rahim : A great moment for Bangladesh cricket. We learnt a couple of things from the last match, a couple of mistakes cost us the game against NZ \n09:03 hrs IST: Virat Kohli : Hyderabad has always been a good batting wicket. It is hard and the fast bowlers do get some help out here. \n09:00 hrs IST: India win the toss and they bat . They are playing five bowlers, which includes three pacers. \n08:54 hrs IST : India have played three Tests in Uppal. After they drew their first Test against New Zealand, they have won their next two against New Zealand and Australia by an innings. Hat-trick of innings wins coming up? \n08:49 hrs IST : Bangladesh played their first Test against India in 2000. Strange that it took them 17 years to play their first Test in India. Their record against India: Played 8, Won 0, Lost 6 and Drawn 2 \n08:40 hrs IST : A warm welcome to the one-off Test between India and Bangladesh from Hyderabad. After three ODIs and three T20Is, the action shifts to the Test match, the ninth for India in the 2016/17 season. After a 3-0 win over New Zealand and 4-0 win over England, Virat Kohli’s team will be hoping to continue the dominance. \nVirat Kohli’s Indian cricket team are on a definite high. They beat England in all three formats of the game recently and unlikely to lose their momentum against Bangladesh, who are in India on the back of a 2-0 loss in New Zealand. \nIt will be the ninth Test match between India and Bangladesh and the first in India. India have won six and drawn two in eight previous Tests played against Bangladesh. The Bengal Tigers played their first ever Test match against India at home in 2000. \nAll eyes will be on R Ashwin. The Tamil Nadu off-spinner needs two wickets to become sixth Indian and 39th bowler overall to take 250 or more wickets in Tests. \nR Ashwin claimed 248 wickets at 24.96 in 82 innings of 44 Tests. He will become the fastest to reach this landmark in terms of matches. Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee took 250th Test wicket in his 48th match, the fastest ever. tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:56:40.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
