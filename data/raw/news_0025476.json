The attacks killed nine people and took place between Nov. 17 and Dec. 13, 2016, in the final stages of the battle for the city. Around 200 people were injured. \nOne local resident told researchers: \n“The smell isn’t something you can handle. The moment you’re exposed to it, your throat burns, it’s like a fire rod going in. It won’t let you swallow or breathe. Your neck starts boiling. You feel nauseated. Your eyes burn and you are not able to control the tears. Eventually, you are not able to breathe. It’s not like having your nose and mouth blocked, rather, your body won’t let the air in anymore.” \nAccording to Human Rights Watch, the Syrian army used the chemical attacks to weaken rebel positions before its troops moved into those districts. “The pattern of the chlorine attacks shows that they were coordinated with the overall military strategy for retaking Aleppo, not the work of a few rogue elements,” Ole Solvang, deputy emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, said in the report. \nSyrian forces supported by Russia and Iran regained full control of Aleppo on Dec. 22 after months of intense fighting between government forces and rebels. The city’s fall was one of the biggest victories for embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad since the start of the conflict.

Rather, Russia and the U.S. forced Assad to give up his chemical weapons stockpiles and join the chemical weapons treaty. \nBut a United Nations and Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inquiry has determined that Syrian forces used chemical weapons in at least three instances in 2014 and 2015, months after joining the treaty. The inquiry also identified top Syrian officials involved in the decision to deploy the weapons, including Assad and his brother Maher, Reuters reported. The Syrian government has denied the allegations.

Security Council and its key role in the Syrian conflict, Moscow should have done more to prevent the attacks, the organization said.
