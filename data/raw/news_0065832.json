It appears that even one of the franchise's stars, Nicholas Hoult , is uncertain - but optimistic - about his own involvement with the film. \nIn a recent interview to promote Hoult's sci-fi film Collide (which he stars in alongside Rogue One: A Star Wars Story 's Felicity Jones ), the 27-year-old actor was asked whether or not he will appear in the X-Men sequel. \nWhile his answer doesn't completely confirm his casting in the film, it does offer a bit of hope to those hoping to see him reprise his role of Hank McCoy / Beast . \n“I think I’m involved. I’d be happy to go back. I love playing that character and I love everyone involved. And I know there’s one in the works.” \nHoult has been one of the franchise's most featured performance since the prequel series of X-Men movies began in 2011. He has played Beast in X-Men: First Class , X-Men: Days of Future Past , and last summer's X-Men: Apocalypse . \nGiven Beast's role as one of the founding members of the X-Men team, and his sort of mentor role as was seen in Apocalypse , it makes perfect sense that Hoult would have some sort of appearance in Supernova . And the fact that Hoult seems more than willing to reprise his role is a good sign that it will happen. \nWhile a lot still remains unconfirmed about Supernova itself, it sounds like Hoult would join his Apocalypse co-stars Sophie Turner and James McAvoy in the film. Fans will just have to wait and see which returning cast members will join the project as well. \nHave you seen X-Men: Apocalypse yet? If so, give it a rating with our Composite Ranking below!
