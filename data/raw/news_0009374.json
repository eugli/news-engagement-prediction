And this time they really will buy some players – we promise. It won’t be for a few months, obviously, buy this transfer game is all about patience. And faith. And this morning’s Daily Mirror is giving you its word that Chelsea are going to spend BIG in the next window. After “keeping his powder dry” in January (which gives another meaning to the phrase Dry January), Roman Abramovich is said to be “already plotting a £100m summer transfer spree” on Celtic’s Moussa Dembele, Real Madrid’s Alvaro Morata and Southampton’s Virgil van Dijk. [WHICH CLUB HAD THE BEST TRANSFER WINDOW?] The Telegraph backs up this claim, saying Chelsea are targeting the trio to avoid another “post-title implosion”. In other words, the Blues are so confident of winning the league that they are already making plans to ensure they are not rubbish afterwards- a fate that befell Jose Mourinho’s champions last season. The broadsheet says Monaco pair Tiemoue Bakayoko and Djibril Sidibe are also on Abramovich’s “radar”, while the Stamford Bridge futures of John Terry, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa are “very much in doubt”. The identity of Manchester United’s top summer target is no secret, with the Red Devils having relentlessly tracked Antoine Griezmann since his Golden Boot-winning display at Euro 2016. The Guardian reiterates claims that the Atletico Madrid striker has already “agreed personal terms” at Old Trafford, although it says the two clubs are yet to agree a fee. PA Sport , however, says United have rubbished claims that an agreement in principle has been reached with the 25-year-old. Which is probably for the best, because Hot Football Transfer Gossip is kind of relying on this transfer saga dragging on for at least another few months. [THE 26 PLAYERS WHO HAVE SCORED 100 OR MORE PREMIER LEAGUE GOALS] Another twist in the Griezmann story has been added by Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s agent Mino Raiola, who suggests in the Star that the in-form Swede could leave United for Napoli in the summer. Zlatan “loves the Neapolitans”, apparently. The people, not the ice cream. Finally, rounding up things that almost happened on transfer deadline day but didn’t, Man Utd saw a late bid to sign Benfica defender Victor Lindelof rejected ( A Bola ), Crystal Palace and Hull failed with last-gasp attempts to sign Rubin Kazan midfielder Yann M’Vila ( Talksport ), Swansea rejected a £30m offer for Gylfi Sigurdsson from an unnamed side in the Chinese Super League ( Wales Online ) and West Ham chairman David Gold says the club should have received £50m for Dimitri Payet ( BT Sport ). Given how wisely the Hammers have spent their transfer funds recently, it’s probably for the best that they only got £25m.
