(ABC News: Cameron Best) \nThe ABC understands that while Liberal and National MPs will vote in favour of the Government bill, the Coalition will explore options for allowing the conventional gas moratorium to be lifted after 2020. \nDetails are yet to be finalised but Coalition sources said there would need to be consultation with landholders, and a consideration of appropriate regulatory frameworks and safeguards, ahead of the 2018 election. \nThe Grattan Institute's Energy Program Director, Tony Wood, said he understood the public support for a ban on fracking. \n\"But it just seems to make absolutely no sense to me as to why we'd have a moratorium on conventional gas,\" he said. \n\"There is a big question as to how much [conventional onshore] gas there really is to be found in Victoria anyway ... [but] as a matter of public policy it's a very bad idea.\" \nThe Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association has called on the Government to immediately lift the moratorium. \nVictorian Farmers Federation President David Jochinke supports the Government's legislation, and argued against lifting the moratorium with the aim of increasing gas supply. \n\"I would want to make sure that you're not completely devastating a whole agricultural industry on the sake of potentially exploring for gas in areas that we traditionally haven't been before,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:46:19.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
