Long live sustainable, locally sourced protein. \nAs much as we’d like to say that there’s a label that will give you the green light — “Organic,” “Grass-Fed,” “Farm-Fresh,” — the reality is, we trust people, not packaging to tell us how good our meat really is. So the better someone can answer questions about how the animals were raised, fed and butchered, the more confident we feel. You want to be as close to the action as possible, without doing the butchering yourself (unless that's how you roll). \nHere’s where to start buying meat the right way, from good to best: More From Bon Appetit When Life Gives You Lemons, Make These Lemon Desserts \nGood \nSome supermarket chains do a better job at sourcing responsible product.
