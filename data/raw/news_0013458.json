The Cowboys also had the third-stingiest scoring defense in the NFC. \nGarrett received 25 votes from a nationwide panel of 50 media members who regularly cover the NFL. He easily outdistanced New England’s Bill Belichick (14 votes). Miami’s Adam Gase got six, Oakland’s Jack Del Rio four, and Kansas City’s Andy Reid one. \nGarrett is the first Dallas coach to win the award since Jimmy Johnson in 1990. Tom Landry won it in 1966. 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T07:43:06.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
