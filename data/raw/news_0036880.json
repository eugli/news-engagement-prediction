While the Su-35S lacks the stealth of the US’s fifth-generation aircraft, it packs an infrared search-and-track radar that can potentially spot even the stealthiest plane. \nThe Su-35S’ incredibly agility and devastating weapons that can fire off boresight make it a difficult match for the US’s F-35, which was not designed to out-turn and manoeuvre against advanced threats like the Su-35S, but rather shoot them down at a distance while remaining unseen. \n“The Su’s ability to go high and fast is a big concern, including for F-35,” an Air Force official with experience on the Joint Strike Fighter program told The National Interest. \nChina has also taken delivery of the new Russian multirole fighter , meaning US planners will be studying the plane to determine just how US forces would take it down should the unthinkable happen.
