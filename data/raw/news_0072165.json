His history at this club speaks for itself,' Fernandinho said. 'With the arrival of Gabriel Jesus and with him scoring goals and providing assists, Aguero ended up on the bench for few games but no one ever had doubts about Aguero's qualities.' Pep Guardiola's side beat Monaco in a rollercoaster clash at the Etihad to keep their hopes of a first Champions League title alive. Gabriel Jesus scored three goals in his first five appearances for Manchester City Fernandinho believes City need players like Aguero to reach the Champions League final City were knocked out at the semi-final stage of last season's competition by Real Madrid. And Fernandinho believes the club need players to replicate Aguero's attitude if they are to achieve their ambition of going one step further. 'Against Monaco he showed [his quality], not only by scoring goals, but also the way he played. Recovering balls, running, pressing, helping the team. 'For a team that wants to reach the Champions League final, which is our aim, we need that spirit, no matter who is playing, we need to do that.' 'This year we are showing that in our games and Aguero more than anyone else embraced that idea, so we are very happy about it.'
