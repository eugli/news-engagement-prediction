By Kate McKenna, CBC News Posted: Feb 22, 2017 6:00 AM ET Last Updated: Feb 22, 2017 6:00 AM ET Jocelyne Lizotte, 60, had been living in a long-term care facility, the Centre d'hébergement Émilie-Gamelin. (Danny Gosselin/Radio-Canada) Related Stories Montreal man, 55, charged with 2nd-degree murder in disabled wife's death \nAdvocates and law makers are renewing calls for changes to the rules surrounding doctor-assisted dying after a Montreal man was charged with second degree murder in connection with the death of his long-suffering wife. \nMichel Cadotte, 55, is accused of killing his wife, 60-year-old Jocelyne Lizotte. A family member told CBC News she had been living with Alzheimer's disease and her family had recently tried to obtain a medically assisted death, but was refused . Montreal man, 55, charged with 2nd-degree murder in disabled wife's death \nLizotte was found dead in her long-term care institution on Monday afternoon. The afternoon she died, a post went up on Cadotte's Facebook page. \n\"I cracked,\" the post reads, in colloquial French. \"Nobody asked me how I'm doing, however, you know, I gave in to her demand for help in dying. I'm waiting for the police.\" \nOther family members told Radio-Canada Lizotte had been ill for many years and had difficulty walking, eating and communicating. Michel Cadotte, 55, is accused of killing his wife, Jocelyn Lizotte. (Facebook) \nCanada and Quebec currently have two separate laws governing medical assistance in dying. Quebec's law, which is narrower than the recently-passed federal version, requires that applicants \"be at the end of life.\" \nThe federal law restricts doctor-assisted death to adults with a \"foreseeable\" death. \nNeither law goes far enough, according to Dying with Dignity CEO Shanaaz Gokool. She would like to see a provision to include \"advance\" consent, allowing terminally ill patients to express their interest in medical aid in dying while they are still cognitively competent. \nIn cases including patients with Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease, this would allow patients to access doctor assisted death even after they've lost their ability to speak. Doctor-assisted death obtained by Sherbrooke, Que. man who starved himself to qualify \n\"We know that Canadians are ready for this provision,\" said Gokool, \"and what they're looking for is leadership in how it can actually happen in practice.\" \nPrior to passing the federal legislation, Ottawa had a joint committee examine the issue of doctor-assisted death. In its report, the committee recommended allowing advance consent in Canada. Dying with Dignity CEO Shanaaz Gokool believes patients should be allowed to request a medically-assisted death before they become unable to vocalize that request. (CBC) \nOne of the chairs of the committee says allowing advance consent could mitigate significant suffering in Canada. \n\"[Patients] may be suffering intolerably without any ability to communication to anyone around them,\" said Conservative Senator Kelvin Ogilvie. \n\"They know they will not be competent to communicate at a certain point. As a result, they are condemned to suffer under these conditions.\" \nOgilvie said he anticipates hearing of more cases similar to Cadotte's unless the law is amended. \n\"If you go on the web, you'll see all sorts of circumstances where people were forced to take their lives when they reached the condition that was simply intolerable or their partner couldn't bear to see them suffering any further,\" he said. Allow people to opt for assisted death while still cognitively competent, group says Legislation being challenged \nShortly after Ottawa's federal assisted dying bill became law in 2016, a B.C. woman with spinal muscular atrophy joined the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association to launched a case challenging its constitutionality. Assisted-dying legislation faces new legal challenge in B.C. \nThe lawsuit of Julia Lamb, 25, says the law is unconstitutional because it deliberately excludes those who are suffering with no immediate end in sight. \n\"Grievously and irremediably ill Canadians who are suffering unbearably should have the right to choose a dignified and compassionate death. This right was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada,\" said Grace Pastine, litigation director for the BCCLA when the suit was launched in June 2016. Better palliative care the answer, says Alzheimer Society \nThe Alzheimer Society of Canada says in a statement that people can live with dementia for longer than ten years, and in that time, they may change their mind on doctor-assisted death. \nThe statement says it's difficult or impossible for caregivers \"to know what the person with dementia comes to value over time, especially if those values are at odds with previously expressed desires.\" \nInstead of calling for a broadening of the laws, the organization is calling for better palliative care in Canada.
