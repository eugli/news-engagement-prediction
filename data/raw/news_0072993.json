It is always wrong,” Bannon said. “If you remember, the campaign was the most chaotic by the media’s description, most disorganized, most unprofessional, had no idea what they were doing. Then you saw them all crying and weeping [on Election Night].” \nPriebus followed up in agreement, saying people were tired of the media’s “ridiculous” stories and are hopeful for change from President Trump ‘s administration. \nWatch above, via Fox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:53:11.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
