The Chilean flag (đ¨đą) looks similar, except the blue field doesn't extend all the way down the left side of the flag. The Unicode Technical Committee , the folks who are in charge of emojis, don't have state-specific flags. \nMany Texans, starved for emoji representation, use the Chilean banner as a substitute. I see that Texas flag đđ¨đąđşđ¸ https://t.co/8ejytfrqPl It's weird that emoji only have the Texas state flag and none of the other states đ¨đą. \nThat flag doesn't fly with Rep. Tom Oliverson, R-Cypress . \n\"I noticed that a lot of people will put 'God bless Texas' and put the Chilean flag,\" Oliverson said. \"Just because it's the closest thing doesn't mean it's an appropriate substitute.\" Texas emojis are fixin' to come to an app near you \nOliverson recognizes that the emoji debate is \"not the most pressing issue\" in front of the 85th legislature , but also said the lone star flag â which was adopted in 1839 as the third of the Republic of Texas â is a sacred symbol among Texans. He hopes people take it as a bipartisan, tongue-in-cheek issue ... with some seriousness. \nOliverson's bill does not go so far as to establish an official state emoji, but he wants to use #TheBlueGoesAllTheWayDown to make sure people know the difference between the banners. \nThis isn't the first time there's been confusion between our flag and the Chilean flag. In 2011, Atascosa County officials accidentally sent out information to absentee voters with the wrong flag. Rep. @TomOliverson for the win: files resolution urging Texans to not use Chile flag emoji in reference to the #Texas flag! #txlege đ¨đą https://t.co/4IWPO20pwM — Jared Staples (@JaredStaples) February 16, 2017 Since Texas was a Country, ONLY STATE can fly Flag same height = USA Flag it needs own Flag emoji not Chile's đ¨đą #txlege @jack @Support https://t.co/Y8xPYhtVya — Pat Johnson (@_PatJohnson_) February 16, 2017 @efindell I also like how it wasn't \"campaign to have a Texas emoji created.\" It was just, \"tell people Chile isn't Texas\" — Kevin Cullen (@KevinMCullen) February 16, 2017 What do we want?
