The right-handed-hitting Valencia could wind up playing more if needed if Vogelbach isn't. \nSecond base (1) : Robinson Cano will play this position as long as he's healthy. Cano should star for Mariners Johns names Cano as star for '17 season MLB.com Mariners reporter Greg Johns selects Robinson Cano as the team's star for 2017 \nShortstop (1) : Jean Segura was acquired as a significant upgrade. \nThird base (1) : Kyle Seager has been an ironman at the hot corner for the past five seasons. Outlook: Seager, 3B, SEA Outlook: Seager coming off career season in '16 Kyle Seager raised his game to another level in 2016, setting career-highs in home runs and OPS, making him a strong contributor at third \nUtility (1) : Shawn O'Malley gets the early nod, but this looks like one of the biggest roster battles, with Taylor Motter and Mike Freeman also in the running. Motter could emerge if his right-handed bat proves to be a valuable weapon in the outfield, as well. The switch-hitting O'Malley is also a solid outfield option if needed. \nOutfield (4) : Jarrod Dyson , Leonys Martin , Mitch Haniger and Guillermo Heredia are a good bet here, though Heredia's spot as the right-handed option to Dyson in left field could be challenged if the club decides some combination of Nelson Cruz , Valencia and Motter or O'Malley could fill a corner spot. That scenario might open a backup role for left-handed-hitting Ben Gamel . \nDesignated hitter (1) : Cruz fills the bill as one of MLB's premier sluggers. He played 48 games in right field last year, as well, but that number continues to decrease as his age (36) increases. Outlook: Cruz, DH/OF, SEA Outlook: Cruz among baseball's most powerful players Nelson Cruz is the only man to reach the 40-homer mark in each of the past three seasons and is likely to remain a huge power threat \nStarting pitcher (5) : Felix Hernandez , James Paxton , Hisashi Iwakuma , Drew Smyly and Yovani Gallardo will be the rotation if all goes to plan, with Ariel Miranda the first option should a spot open up. \nBullpen (7) : The favorites to break camp right now are closer Edwin Diaz and fellow right-handers Nick Vincent , Evan Scribner , Dan Altavilla and Shae Simmons and lefties Marc Rzepczynski and Miranda. That assumes Steve Cishek isn't quite ready to pitch by Opening Day as he returns from offseason hip labrum surgery. If Cishek is ready to go, either Altavilla or Simmons would likely open the season with Triple-A Tacoma. has covered the Mariners since 1997, and for MLB.com since 2011.
