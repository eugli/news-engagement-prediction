The two suspended teachers will be on probation for five years and monitored closely. Children with special needs were also reportedly named in the game.\nParents are insisting to know whether the school knew about the video prior to Monday, since it was recorded a month before that date.\n“It’s disturbing to know that these are our educators,” Jennifer Prentice, a parent, told Fox17. “They are in charge of protecting our children, keeping our children safe, and the fact that they just blew that out of the water shows their character and shows that maybe they’re not right for this job.”\nRobert Hubert, Bangor Schools’ attorney, said that no further penalties would be imposed on the staff members concerned.\n“It was heartbreaking,” said Amanda Reprogal, the parent of a student named in the video. “My heart sank, and I was disgusted.”\n“You teach your kids to respect authority, and then how do you respect authority figures when they behave like that?” Ronnie Booker, a father, told Fox17.\nFollow Rob Shimshock on Twitter \nSend tips to [email protected] . \nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
