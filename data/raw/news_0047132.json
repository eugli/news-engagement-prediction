According to the federal government, 145,000 hectares of poor-quality lands have been reclaimed. (B.Gjetvaj / branimirphoto.ca) \nTaylor shares what his days were like on the range looking after the cattle, checking for erosion and how species are at risk. \nHe says that cattle ranchers taking on the workload of assessing the issues involved in what the program was in charge of is not realistic. \n\"The government really can't expect the leasees to take over the responsibilities as pasture managers to maintain it.\" So what makes the grasslands so important to preserve? \n\"Temperate grasslands are the most endangered, least protected ecosystems on the planet right now,\" says Trevor Herriot , co-chair of an organization dedicated to protecting the grasslands called Public Pastures-Public Interest . \n\"They've been here for 8,000 years on the Canadian plains and you know there's 30 species at risk.\" \nHerriot tells Tremonti why it's so vital to protect the grasslands now before it's too late. \n\"In Saskatchewan we used to have 190,000 square km of native grassland, 150 years ago. Today we have roughly 33,000 square km — so 80 per cent of it's gone.\" \nHerriot emphasizes protection of the grasslands includes cattle ranchers. \n\"Cattle ranching is an important ecological substitution and our traditional ranching families are really the first line of defence,\" Herriot explains. \n\"But they're going to need some help in the modern economy that is, you know, pushing everything towards the sort of highest profitable use of any kind of land.\" \nListen to the full conversation at the top of this post. \nThis segment was produced by The Current's Kristin Nelson and Willow Smith.
