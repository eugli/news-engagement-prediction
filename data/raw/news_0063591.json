Additional secretaries, joint secretaries and other officers have been assigned one district each. \n\n\nExecutives of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation , Oil India , Indian Oil Corporation , Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum too have to visit a district each. On their visit, everyone will carry a four-page survey sheet that will have to be filled with information from the respective district on refineries, terminals, storage tanks, LPG bottling plants, aviation stations, retails outlets, kerosene and LPG dealerships, LPG coverage, Ujjwala Yojna beneficiaries, hassles faced in obtaining connections under Ujjwala, feedback from rural beneficiaries, cashless transactions facilities and rate of such transactions. \n\nThe officials and the executives will meet consumers, distributors, district administration officials and other stakeholders to understand the situation on the ground and how companies are catering to the local demand and implementing the government programme such as Ujjwala Yojna where poor get subsidised cooking gas connection, or the official push towards digital payments. \n\n\"The idea behind is to understand the adequacy of the existing infrastructure to meet petroleum demand in each district. Based on the outcome of this exercise, we will intervene wherever necessary to make supplies better,\" the oil ministry official said. \n\nThe visits, which have just begun, will conclude by March-end.
