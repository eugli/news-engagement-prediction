Enrolment to the plan would cost a one-time fee of 99 rupees, he added. \nBharti Airtel, India's largest telecoms network operator, currently offers unlimited voice and 2GB of 4G data a month for as low as 300 rupees although tariffs vary across regions. The company, launched in 1995, has nearly 270 million customers. \nBharti reported its lowest profit in four years in the quarter ended December as competition from Jio eroded its revenues. Idea Cellular, India's No.3 telecoms network operator, posted its first ever quarterly loss over the period. \nThe price war resulting from Jio's entry has also spurred consolidation in the sector with Idea and Vodafone Plc's Indian unit, the market's No.2 player, beginning talks for a merger of their operations. \nJio's launch came after years of delay and Reliance Industries has already invested more than $20 billion into the venture. \nShares of some of Jio's rivals fell. As of 1000 GMT, Bharti Airtel's shares were down almost 4 percent while Idea Cellular shares had slipped 0.5 percent.
