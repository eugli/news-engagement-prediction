It is backed by a number of investors, including fund manager Neil Woodford.\nSavings are protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme to the tune of £85,000, or £170,000 for joint accounts.\nCelebrity: According to rumours, pop star Will.i.am may be a shareholder in the bank and could sit on the board\nBut many may be scratching their heads at just why Atom Bank has acted so aggressively with the rates.\nIn an e-mail received on Wednesday 22 February morning, Atom told This is Money it was moving its one-year fix up to a best buy, but to a slimmer 1.7 per cent.\nIts two-year was moving up to 1.8 per cent, three-year to 1.9 per cent and five-year to 2.3 per cent.\nBy the evening, it had changed its tune – and revealed it was offering the bumper rates by the standards of current conditions, in what it described as 'amazing news for customers'.\nGood rates: So, why is the Durham based bank offering such bumper rates? It says its cost efficient compared to rivals\nA spokesman for Atom added: 'Our savings are distributed through the Atom Banking app. We don't have branches, we don't have big call centres, we don't have desktop browser services.\n'This single-minded approach means that we are taking the cost, the complexity and the inefficiency out of banking.\n'We intend to share the benefits of doing so with our customers and we are only just getting started. We're here to disrupt, and that's exactly what we're doing.\n'With regard to rate availability, just like the rest of the market, we can't guarantee our rates for a certain period of time, but we are committed to making things better for our customers and will be doing our best to remain competitive.'\nJames Blower, independent expert at The Savings Guru and former head of a number of challenger banks, said: 'These rates are great for savers.\n'So why are Atom paying so much? It needs savers money to lend out to customers of their newly launched mortgage business. This has some very attractive rates on offer so I expect they are seeing good demand.\n'However, in late December, Atom announced that they had raised £110million of savings on their fixed deposits. This is not very much in eight months in a savings market worth over £1.4 trillion and is a fraction of what other new banks have raised.\n'So, have they been struggling to raise deposits compared to others? It certainly looks like it. They have also offered pretty competitive rates previously - so rates are unlikely to be issue.\n'A look at the reviews for the bank show a really mixed bag. Atom has been a bit marmite with most people either loving it or hating it and going elsewhere.\n'There are suggestions there has been problems with the app and also that the operational support, if customers need to communicate away from the app, isn't so strong. So this could well be deterring savers.\n'Savers can only apply for fixed deposits via the Atom app. The app also requires the use of things like selfies for security. While these are the sort of features that young millennials love, the average saver is usually in their late 60s.\n'This customer typically might be happy to research online via a phone or tablet but will apply for an account via a desktop PC or post/phone.\n'Atom may have realised this and are possibly over paying on rates to compensate and encourage savers to preserve. If that's the case, I hope they have also enhanced their customer support to cope with the influx of enquiries they will inevitably get with these rates.\n'In summary, this is great news for savers who are happy to get to grips with the Atom app, but I'm not sure I'd be so happy if I was an investor in the Bank seeing savings rates being offered well over market rates and also more than those being paid by some of its mortgage customers.'\nCharlotte Nelson, of independent comparison website Moneyfacts, adds: 'It's fantastic to see positive movement in the savings market. These new rates from Atom Bank will make their mark on the best buys.\n'However, with these deals operated by mobile app only some savers may be put off.\n'Competition amongst the challenger banks has started to hot up of the past few weeks. Many savers will be wary of these unknown brands but with protection schemes in places there is little to worry about.'\nDeals Of The Week Top rate: 5% on up to £2.500 FlexDirect 1.1% easy access rate Top savings deal Spend £10, get £15 bonus in ANY store New members only Best buy low rate card 5.85% APR £7+ in monthly rewards Blue Rewards", "external_links": ["http://www.nationwide.co.uk/", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/credit-cards/details/?productCode=CC_AA_TRANSFER_PLUS_CARD&index=3&count=106&selectedProductId=CC_AA_TRANSFER_PLUS_CARD&gid=CC_ALLCARDS&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/shop/third-party-promotion-click/?product_sku=SAV_RCIBANK_48F18975BBD543A59694F181F61CBE1C&source=TM1&channel_id=116", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/current-accounts/details/?productCode=CUR_barclaybnk_BankAcc_BlueRewards_tier_01_0_0&index=2&count=11&selectedProductId=CUR_barclaybnk_BankAcc_BlueRewards_tier_01_0_0&gid=CUR_OVERDRAFT&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.quidco.com/ref?cid=4831&utm_source=ThisisMoney&utm_campaign=ThisisMoney_AffiliateArticle&utm_medium=AffiliateArticle"], "published": "2017-02-24T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T11:28:38.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
