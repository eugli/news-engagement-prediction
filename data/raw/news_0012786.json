While I got to witness quite a few interesting designs, the poorly managed event and the lack of top celebs left me disappointed. Lakme Fashion Week has been the most prestigious fashion week for more than a decade now. After attending the past five seasons of the event religiously, I felt this season was a letdown. Not only was I startled by the disinterested attitude of the organisers but also, very few people were ready to help. There were a couple of good moments too, but the problem is that there were just a few. To give you a lowdown of my experience, check out all the HITS and MISSES from Lakme Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2017 right here… \nHITS \n# Gorgeous collections \nThe best part of Lakme Fashion Week has always been the clothes and this season too, I witnessed fantastic collections. From Anita Dongre to Gaurang to Tarun Tahiliani and Kunal Rawal , the top designers showcased some mesmerising outfits. However, that’s not it. As always we even saw the gen-next designers showcase their creations and I have to say they were really good. \n# Dazzling shows \nDesigners, over the past few years, have been putting up an audio-visual experience with a certain theme to engage the audience. This is not only good to look at, but it also helps enhances their show and collection. This year too, I saw quite a few interesting shows. Outhouse, Tarun Tahiliani, Gaurang, Ritu Kumar, Splash and Anita Dongre put up really dazzling shows and I have to say they were breath-taking and need to be applauded for that. Varun Dhawan and Malaika Arora also stunned as they walked at LFW. Video: #LakmeFashionWeek 2017 Grand Finale begins, #KareenaKapoorKhan to walk soon pic.twitter.com/TeDjzxM4A0 \n— BollywoodLife (@bollywood_life) February 5, 2017 \n# Kareena Kapoor Khan’s magical walk \nWhenever Kareena Kapoor Khan walks at the Lakme Fashion Week, it is magical. But last night, I have to say that it was out of the world. The actress has been ending the most prestigious fashion week with the grand finale over the past few years and she continued the tradition this year too. The fact that she was walking on the ramp only 45 days after she delivered her baby boy, made the show even more special. And I have to say, she looked drop dead gorgeous. Not only was she fit and fine, but she looked like a fairy princess in an off-white ensemble she wore. \n# Venue \nEvery year, LFW is held at a five-star hotel in Mumbai. However this year, it was shifted to the Jio Gardens in the city. While I was accustomed to the hotel and it took a while to get used to the new settings, the change in venue was refreshing. The runway had an interesting entry and I quite liked the place. However, I guess it can be improved in certain areas. For example, walking from the media centre to the runway and then to the post-show press conference area was taxing. Also, there was no shade at many places and with the summer heat beating down, it got a little uncomfortable standing in certain places. Apart from that, the venue was pretty cool.

However this year, apart from the first and last day, we didn’t see many stars. In fact, top stars like Salman Khan , Akshay Kumar , Amitabh Bachchan, Shraddha Kapoor, Sidharth Malhotra, Ranbir Kapoor were missed. Stars bring in support to the designers and their collections, but that did not happen this time. \n# Ill-managed event \nAny event is enjoyable only when it is managed well. However, Lakme Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2017 was really ill-managed. As I told you, walking from the runway to the media centre and to the post-show press conference ten to twelve times a day was taxing. A few organisers didn’t even know about show timings, venues and show stoppers.

So when a top star would come in for a show, a few reporters from top channels and magazines would come in out of nowhere and they would get interviews with them. But reporters from digital websites like me and a few others, who attended all the shows, were made to beg for interviews.

But when the organisers are only uninterested then how will Lakme Fashion Week be a HIT? We were really surprised seeing how only a few representatives at the venue were ready to help. An international reporter, who had travelled all the way to India to cover the fashion week, had a difficult time. I saw her running around, not understanding where to go. And even though the representatives noticed this, they did not offer to help her. \nAnd then, the person who was in charge of the post-show press conference (I won’t take names), didn’t take an initiative to remember the proper names. Many times the person called out the wrong name, spelt it incorrectly or just forgot. Iulia corrected her during the press conference. And then, sometimes the organisers were missing while the designers and actors waited in the post show area. We agree that working throughout the day for five days can be taxing on one person, so you can maybe depute people in shifts, right? \n# Poor arrangements \nApart from all these things, the arrangements were also shabby. Every time someone walked in the post-show press conference area, the floor used to creak. Wires were also lying all over the place and many times people nearly tripped on them. \nThen there were no chairs for designers and actors in the post-show press conference area and this did not go down well with the designers and actors. How long can they stand in high heels and heavy dresses? Swara Bhaskar and Nimrat Kaur complained about it, but they were told that the media wanted the full view of their outfits, which wasn’t really the case. All the cameramen were fine if they were seated. In fact, they even offered their chairs when the actors and designers decided that it would be better if they sat. \nBut the most horrific thing that I saw was the exposed wires behind the media pit in the 6 Degree studio. Obviously, for all the lightings and sound, the organisers need a lot of equipment and for that electricity. Live wires were plugged into numerous sockets at the back of the media pit in one of the show areas. If anyone would have touched those wires, something unfortunate could have happened. And after Iulia Vantur’s show, one of the wires even sparked.

The finale was held at the Bandra Fort and the media was stationed on top of the amphitheatre. When celebs started coming in, the media could not take pictures and videos clearly coz of people’s heads coming in between. \n# Lack of appropriate security \nSecurity is a major concern at such big events. And while there was appropriate security cover, I saw many gate crashers come into the park. A lot of onlookers were seen at the venue and they used to come into the post-show press conference area for taking pictures with the celebs. They would come in between interviews which would cause a lot of delays. \nObviously, the celebs won’t be comfortable with it. A lot of onlookers got into the media pit and sat behind the cameraman, trying to get a glimpse of the show. Surprisingly, no one stopped them. \nSo these were the HITS and MISSES of Lakme Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2017 .
