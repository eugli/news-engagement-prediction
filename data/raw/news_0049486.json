Homan, the current acting ICE director: googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-0'); }); \n“As of May 21, 2016, there were 950,062 aliens with final orders of removal on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) national docket. Of those aliens, 939,056 were on ICE’s non-detained docket and 11,006 were on ICE’s detained docket,” said Homan’s answer to questions from Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-1'); }); \nWhat does that translate to? 950,062 illegal aliens who have exhausted their legal options and are supposed to be removed/deported. But only 11,006, or about 1%, are under a detention order. \nWhere are the others? Jessica M. Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies explains. \nIn Homan’s answers to Grassley, he said that “Individuals on ICE’s non-detained docket with final orders of removal are released under conditions designed to ensure their compliance with their immigration obligations.” \nVaughan translated: “11,006 of the 950,062 aliens with final orders of removal (exhausted all appeals) were in detention. The rest were at large. The ‘conditions’ they mention usually means ‘own recognizance,’ or no conditions, or bond, no reporting requirements, or calling an automated phone line to check in, or wearing an ankle bracelet, or checking in with an ICE officer in person – in that order of frequency, as far as I know. In other words, most of these people were just in the wind.” googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); \nAs we can see, even being under a detainer order doesn’t necessarily mean that ICE will be able to deport the person ultimately, if the local authorities aren’t cooperative. In Denver, the police released a man with a detainer order, he has since been arrested for a murder. \nThere are an estimated 3 million illegal aliens with criminal histories. The Trump administration has said that those with criminal histories will be a priority for removal. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-1'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-3'); }); \n“Why does ICE have to take to the streets to find these people? One reason is because so many criminal aliens have been released by sanctuary policies. If you look at the list of cities where these operations took place, many of them are sanctuaries. ICE has to do these kinds of operations when they are prevented from arresting criminal aliens while they are in jail,” she added. \nSo getting rid of sanctuary cities and actually allowing the local authorities to cooperate with ICE would go a long way to helping the issue.
