Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nAmazon / Business Insider \nWhile 2016 was a bummer of a year for a whole host of reasons, no on can deny it was a banner year for music. \nWith blockbuster album from established artists like Beyonce, Rihanna, Drake, and Kanye to the coming out party of Chance the Rapper, the Grammy's (airing on CBS this Sunday), is going to be incredibly competitive. \nPerformances are expected by artists across the board, including A Tribe Called Quest and Anderson .Paak, Lady Gaga and Metallica, Adele, Beyonce (and her unborn children), and the glorious return of Daft Punk backing The Weeknd. \nIf you’re looking to get a head start on the musical festivities, or are looking to stock your record collection with some of the best albums from 2016, we’ve collected some of the Grammy nominated albums that you can find on vinyl. \nUnfortunately, not every artist's work is available (if anyone finds “The Life of Pablo” on vinyl please contact me directly), but there are still a ton of amazing artists well worthy of joining your favorite records on your shelf. \nTake a look at what you may have missed, and get ready for what’s sure to be an impressive show on Sunday. “25” by Adele Amazon \nWhat it’s nominated for: Record Of The Year, Album Of The Year, Song Of The Year, Best Pop Solo Performance, Best Pop Vocal Album \nWhy you should check it out: All Adele does is put out hits; she has not one, but two albums in the top 100 right now because people never stop buying her hits. Anyone that’s good enough to sell out six nights at Madison Square Garden deserves a spot in your record collection. “Blurryface” by Twenty One Pilots Amazon \nWhat it’s nominated for: Record Of The Year, Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, Best Rock Performance, Best Rock Song, Best Song Written For Visual Media \nWhy you should check it out: I was pretty cold on Twenty One Pilots until I saw them live. While I am still not crazy about the whole rap-singing thing, Blurryface has some undeniable radio hits. “Purpose” by Justin Bieber Amazon \nWhat it’s nominated for: Album Of The Year, Song Of The Year, Best Pop Solo Performance, Best Pop Vocal Album \nWhy you should check it out: Have you seen the video for Sorry? Or the video for What Do U Mean? They’re nuts. Absolutely insane. One even features a cameo from John Leguizamo. \nThe songs are pretty good too, as \"The Biebs\" is probably the closest thing we have to a true pop star right now. “Views” by Drake Amazon \nWhat it’s nominated for: Album Of The Year, Best Rap Performance, Best Rap/Sung Performance, Best Rap Song, Best Rap Album \nWhy you should check it out: Respect the Six God. “A Sailor’s Guide to Earth” by Sturgill Simpson Amazon \nWhat it’s nominated for: Album Of The Year, Best Country Album \nWhy you should check it out: Sturgill Simpson was recently the musical guest on SNL. I saw his name and was ready to dismiss him as just another country act, buy boy was I wrong. \nIt was the most impressed I’ve ever been by an SNL artist I hadn't heard before. Watch the video for yourself and I’m convinced you’ll want to buy the record.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:00:06.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
