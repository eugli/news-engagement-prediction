Brandon's actions are completely unacceptable,\" head coach Matt Rhule added. \"We will not tolerate conduct that is contradictory to these values.\" \nWashington, 33, was arrested at a local hotel on a solicitation of prostitution charge, McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara confirmed to The Tribune . If convicted for the Class B misdemeanor, Washington faces a maximum sentence of 180 days in jail and/or a fine of no more than $2,000. \nWashington, who was released on a $1,000 bond from McLennan County Jail on Saturday, was a member of the strength training staff at Temple last season and followed former Temple head coach Rhule to Baylor this winter.
