Honda had unveiled the all new WR-V at the Sao Paulo Auto Show in Brazil last year. We had earlier reported that the all new Honda WR-V is coming to India this year, now we have confirmation that the WR-V is indeed coming and that too next month. \nThe new Honda WR-V has been spotted at various dealerships across the country and was recently spotted testing on the Indian roads. Honda has manufactured the new WR-V at the company's plant in Tapukara, Rajasthan. Honda is calling the car a hatchback crossover and it will be the smallest car in its category in Honda's stable. Honda WR-V \nDesign: \nHonda designers have worked hard to ensure that the similarities with the Jazz are not all that evident. The WR-V comes with a new front end which has a high bonnet line and bulbous headlamps to give it that rugged look. There is a lot of chrome on the grille and a scuff plate adds to the appearance. In profile it is evident that the WR-V will offer considerably more clearance than the Jazz and the crossover design is completed by the plastic cladding all around. The tail lamps reminds one of the Jazz but the tail gate does a good job in differentiating the rear design. Roof rails add to the crossover aura. So overall, the new WR-V looks fresh. \nInside though, the WR-V will borrow plenty of parts from the Jazz and this includes the dash. The instrument panel too will be carried over from the Jazz. The seats though will be offered with a new fabric and in two tone. Honda WR-V \nEngine: \nThe Honda WR-V will borrow the engine and transmission from the Jazz. So under the bonnet expect to see the tried and tested 1.2-litre i-VTEC petrol that produces peak power of 89 bhp and peak torque of 110 Nm , mated to a five-speed manual transmission and a CVT. The phenomenally efficient 1.5-litre i-DTEC diesel will churn out maximum power output of 99 bhp and maximum torque of 200 Nm, mated to six-speed manual transmission. \nFeatures: \nThe new Honda WR-V will come with redesigned headlamps with circular fog lamps, chrome door handles and diamond-cut alloy wheels. On the inside, the Honda WR-V gets touch screen infotainment system, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and climate control. \nCompetition: \nThe new Honda WR-V will take on the likes of Ford EcoSport, Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, Hyundai i20 Active and Toyota Etios Cross in India. Honda WR-V \nPrice: \nWe expect the new Honda WR-V to be priced from Rs 7 lakh (ex showroom, New Delhi)- Rs 9 lakh (ex-showroom, New Delhi).
