The three other officers involved have in turn been charged with 'deliberate violence'. All face trial. Today bloodstains were still visible where the attack happened, and the alleged victim was still 'traumatised' with a 'severe wound' in hospital. Hundreds of people took to the streets again yesterday to protest about the young man's degrading treatment. Locals wrote an obscene message to the local constabulary on a wall in the area Rioters threw a metal pole through the window of this shop in Aulnay-sous-Bois in Paris Hundreds of people took to the streets following the alleged attack on the man known as Theo As well as the internal injuries, it is alleged the man suffered extensive head wounds and has led to considerable anger on the streets. The severity of his injuries led a doctor to declare him unfit to work for 60 days. Speaking to French television station BFM on Monday, Theo described being ordered to stand against a wall by police, who deny the allegations and say they were targeting lookouts for drug dealers. 'I saw him with his baton. He rammed it into my buttocks on purpose. I fell onto my stomach, I had no strength left,' Theo explained, adding that he had also been racially abused in a patrol car afterwards. Video footage of the arrest filmed by the police has been released. The youth worker, known only as 'Theo' claimed the officer inserted the baton deliberately CCTV appears to show the man, named Theo, being attacked with a baton by an officer Furious protests have been held on the estate where the incident allegedly occurred Large demonstrations have been held by a community shocked by the allegations Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux confirmed late Sunday that all four officers had been suspended during the investigation, adding that exemplary conduct and respect \"must guide the behaviour of security forces at all times\". There were minor clashes and arson attacks on the vast housing estate, called '3,000', on Saturday and Sunday evening where the arrest took place. At least five people were detained, police sources said. With tensions high, further incidents occurred Monday for a third consecutive evening. Three vehicles were set on fire and 'several' arrests made, according to a police source. A helicopter and police reinforcements had been deployed. The latest incident comes in the middle of a presidential election campaign and follows the death of 24-year-old Adama Traore in police custody in another Parisian suburb last year. That incident led to several nights of clashes in Beaumont-sur-Oise against the police, with cars and public property also set alight. Two autopsies were unable to determine the cause of Traore's death. A group calling itself Black Lives Matter France, an offshoot of the movement against police brutality in the United States, seized on the case and helped organise protests. Police say they are frequently targeted by delinquents as they play a game of cat-and-mouse with gangs and drug dealers in tough parts of French suburbs. Officers staged nationwide protests in October to denounce their ever-increasing workload, bureaucracy, outdated equipment and what is seen as lenient sentencing for those found guilty of violence against officers. Hundreds of people incensed by the alleged treatment of Theo, a youth worker, marched Monday through Aulnay-sous-Bois. Some carried banners reading 'Justice for Theo', while nearby someone had scrawled 'Police, rapists' on a wall. Theo's brother-in-law Johann told BFM television: 'He was there at the wrong time and came across some crooks.' A window of the local police station was smashed by rioters angry over the alleged rape of a 22-year-old man who was arrested last Thursday Theo's sister Aurelie called for calm but said justice must be served. 'My brother is someone who's very kind, very helpful. He works with young people, he's always bringing people together,' she said. The Socialist politician in charge of the Seine-Saint-Denis region where Aulnay-sous-Bois is located, Stephane Troussel, said Sunday that the incident raised 'numerous questions'. 'Although thousands of police are doing their work properly... too many arrests end in nightmares for some young people. The image of the Republic is being tarnished. We have to urgently find a solution,' he said in a statement. In 2005, the death of two teenagers who were electrocuted while hiding from police in an electricity substation sparked weeks of riots. Around 10,000 cars were burned and 6,000 people were arrested. The far-right National Front (FN), which is riding high in the polls ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections from April, urged people not to judge all of France's security forces. Police and officials have called for calm while an investigation into the allegations takes place Riot officers attempted to keep calm as they tried to cope with angry locals The FN's anti-immigration leader Marine Le Pen rails frequently against 'lawlessness' and promises 'zero tolerance' of crime in the rundown suburbs which are home to many newcomers to France. The FN's general secretary general Nicolas Bay told France 2: If the facts are confirmed, then it's serious and reprehensible. '(But) one shouldn't take advantage to heap criticism on the police who do admirable work in very difficult conditions.' Rioting has taken place every night since, with Socialist presidential candidate Benoit Hamon saying: 'Police represent the republic that they protect. There is an urgent need to reestablish confidence.' 'We are doing everything possible to maintain public order,' said a local police source. 'Gangs of youths have been attacking us, and setting property on fire every night. The fear is that this violence will escalate.' Graffiti brands police 'rapists' in Aulnay-sous-Bois following the alleged attack At one stage over the weekend all street lightening went out on the 3000 – which is named after the approximate number of people who live there – because of an act of vandalism. Police argue that Theo's injuries are consistent with an accident, in which his tracksuit bottoms fell down and the baton penetrated him. It was not until the patrol brought the man back to their station that they noticed he was bleeding, and called paramedics. 'He was there at the wrong time and came across some crooks,' his brother-in-law Johann told BFM television, explaining the arrest. His sister Aurelie called for calm as supporters gathered outside her brother's home on Monday holding banners reading 'Justice for Theo'. The local prosecutor's office said the police had stopped a group of around a dozen people 'after hearing calls characteristic of lookouts at drug dealing sites'. During the operation they 'attempted to arrest a 22-year-old man'. When he resisted, they used tear gas, and 'one of them used an expandable baton,' the prosecutor's office said, without giving further details.
