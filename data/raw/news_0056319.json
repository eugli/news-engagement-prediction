Astronomers have always presumed that other stars must have their planets, but it was only in 1995 that an exoplanet — one orbiting a star other than the sun — was confirmed. More than 3,400 of these have been discovered since. The Trappist-1 cluster, however, is the first discovery of planets that are about the size of Earth and might have the right composition and temperature to have oceans of liquid water, and therefore, possibly, life. The planets were discovered by measuring dips in the light emitted by Trappist-1, which enabled astronomers to calculate their number and size. The next step will be to observe the planets for signs of the gases that would indicate life exists on them. In the meantime, astronomers will be checking other ultracool dwarfs to see what’s orbiting around them. What makes this story so irresistible is the mystery and allure of the cosmos that all of us know from the first time we looked up at the stars. The article in the journal Nature announcing the discovery, signed by a large team of astronomers led by Michaël Gillon of the University of Liège in Belgium, began with the simple declaration that searching for Earth-like exoplanets is “one aim of modern astronomy.” There was no effort, and no need, to further justify the enormous commitment of resources, ingenuity, time and effort in a project that, on the face of it, has no obvious commercial or practical benefit. There is always the possibility of collateral benefits, of course, but none could be greater than finding out whether anyone else is out there. \nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .
