If the ANC can deploy the army at the State if the Nation Address he can surely authorise protection for vulnerable farmers by support for local farm watch organisations and deal with these murderers‚” Kriel said. \nShe said Zuma’s inaction served as tacit approval of the murders. \n“Should we assume that he and the ANC are condoning them? If he remains silent and impotent on such an important matter then he himself is complicit in the murder of these helpless individuals and should face the full might of the law either in South Africa of in the International Criminal Court in The Hague‚\" she said. \nSouth Africa recently signalled its intention to withdraw from the ICC‚ but a court ruled this week that this could only happen with parliament's approval. \nKriel said: “South Africa is a society with unreported murders in all walks of society. Yes‚ every gruesome murder is shocking and unacceptable‚” she said. Repeated attempts to get comment from The Presidency were not responded to. \nBlack First Land First leader Andile Mgxithama has said violence meted out against white farmers was simply retribution from \"black slave\" farm workers. \nHe said the culture of violence was so deeply entrenched in farm life‚ brutal attacks on \"white masters\" were not surprising. \n\"If you look at the gruesome manner in which farmers are attacked‚ it is more like a response or revenge. Even the farmers that are not involved in brutality end up becoming victims because of the culture of violence. The death of these farmers is minuscule compared to the horrors that black people face. Black people are backed into a corner. \n“Farm life for blacks is characterised by dispossession and violence. I was born and raised on a farm. Farms are controlled by white people and the workers are just property. You can’t have visitors without permission and you can’t go to town without permission‚” he said. \nMurdered blacks were largely ignored‚ Mgxithama said. \n“The murders of black people on farms are not counted. Occasionally people react when white farmers are slain.” Share Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
