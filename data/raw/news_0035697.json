(Something to do with the skin, no?) Siliq, a new drug to treat the skin condition, which the American Academy of Dermatology reports affects 7.5 million people in the United States alone, was just approved by the FDA. A few years ago, model (and forever #browgoals) Cara Delevingne revealed that she has it almost all over her body, and it flares up when she's stressed out. In case you're still wondering exactly what psoriasis is, it's a chronic condition where the brain erroneously fires messages instructing skin cells to grow at a rapid pace. And because the body can't keep up with all the shedding that's needed with all that extra growth, the skin cells build-up on the surface, causing thick patches to appear. Plaque psoriasis, or psoriasis vulgaris, is the most common form of the condition—and that's exactly what Siliq, an injectable treatment, is formulated to address. You May Also Like Skin Microneedling Hurts Like Crazy, But I Can't Wait to Do It Again We have some good news for both millions of Americans and Delevingne: The new FDA approved drug looks like it works wonders. \"Data from the clinical trials needed for FDA approval showed outstanding efficacy, perhaps even better than others on the market,\" says Joshua Zeichner , a dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. The FDA reports that most patients in the trials experienced clear or almost clear skin by the conclusion. \"Psoriasis can pop up almost anywhere, but is most common on the elbows, knees, and the scalp,\" Zeichner goes on. \"Some people may suffer one or two spots, while others may have a severe case affecting the entire body.\" Psoriasis, which tends to appear between the ages of 15 and 35, can also be mistaken for eczema ( eczema ), an inflammatory condition, although the former is dry to the touch. If you have a few patches of psoriasis, you can usually get by with topical treatments, like Sernivo Spray and cortisone creams. If those don't work, cortisone injections may help. But if you have psoriasis on over 10 percent of your body's surface area—with the palm of your hand measuring 1 percent—you've got a severe case. That's where this new drug comes into play. Other than Siliq, here are some skin treatments we love:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:55:23.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
