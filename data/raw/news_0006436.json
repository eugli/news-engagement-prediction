PUBLISHED: 08:21, Thu, Feb 2, 2017 | UPDATED: 08:29, Thu, Feb 2, 2017 \nLast night reports in France claimed Manchester United have agreed a deal with Griezmann to join the club, on a similar salary to Paul Pogba’s £290,000 a week.But an Old Trafford source has denied that United have an agreement in place with the France international.The transfer revelations came on a frustrating night for Manchester United as they dropped two points at home to Hull. GETTY Reports claim Antoine Griezmann has given the thumbs up to joining Manchester United How Man United could look with Antoine Griezmann Wed, February 1, 2017 1 of 12 Is this how Manchester United could look with Antoine Griezmann \nJose Mourinho was furious after the 0-0 draw, storming out of a TV interview with the BBC.Given the evidence on show, Griezmann would come as a huge boost to United and Mourinho.Mourinho’s forwards drew a blank against Hull, despite finishing the game with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Marcus Rashford and Wayne Rooney all on the pitch.And while Mourinho did not comment on Griezmann, he has admitted the club’s summer transfer plans were already in motion. \n\"In our case, we are more focused on the summer period,\" Mourinho said hours before January transfer window shut on Tuesday night. \"I like my players, so nothing for me. I know what I want.\"I always think every week, the more I know my players, the more I know my team, the more I know the competition, because it's a competition I know really well, but it's a competition that is in permanent evolution.\"I know what I want, yeah. I know what I want. But the market closes today, so there is no point, especially for me, to speak about the next transfer window when we have so many matches to play, so many competitions to fight for and so many good players to work with. \n\"So if you ask me do I know what I want for the next transfer window? Yes, I know. Is it possible to get? I try always to be realistic.\"I remember many years ago when I was asking for a second goalkeeper, the technical director gave me a list of possible second goalkeepers and the first choice was (Gianluigi) Buffon to be my second goalkeeper.\"I'm always realistic, I always try to give options that are gettable, but we'll have time to speak about it in the summer.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T10:35:18.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
