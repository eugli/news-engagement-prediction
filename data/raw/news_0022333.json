While that is true, there's actually some subliminal sexual stuff happening in the design: Boobs.\nIn the 1960s, McDonald's hired design consultant and psychologist Louis Cheskin to come up with a new logo, Food Beast reports. In the book Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal , author Eric Schlosser revealed that Cheskin convinced McDonald's executives that breast-shaped arches would send a subliminal message and help bring in customers.\n When the restaurant chain hired Cheskin, it was in the process of redoing its business model, focusing on simplicity, uniformity, and the ability to replicate the same environment in every location. In the new restaurants, there were brick walls and mansard roofs, different from the slanted roofs customers were used to at the time.\nCheskin was helping to ease that transition and called the golden arches \"mother McDonald's breasts.\" He said they had significant Freudian importance in the subconscious minds of customers.\nHere's the logo in 1953.", "external_links": ["http://www.foodbeast.com/news/mcd-logo-secret/", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mcdonald-s-logo-1953-1486492532.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=768:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mcdonald-s-logo-1953-1486492532.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003G83UI2", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mcdonald-s-logo-1953-1486492532.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*"], "published": "2017-02-07T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:09:59.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
