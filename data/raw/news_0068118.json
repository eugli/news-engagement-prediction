In fact, the people she nominates don't even know she has recommended them unless she is successful.\nAnd Brown, 89, has a pretty good track record — 15 of the people she has nominated have received the province's highest honour.\nSuccess on her first attempt Sitting in the living room of her Bridgewater, N.S, home while her cat Juniper mills about, she recalls seeing notices about the order when it was first announced.\n\"I thought it was a great thing and my older daughter said I should nominate someone,\" the former nurse said.\nFor her first nomination — which turned into her first success — Brown settled on Lorne Clarke, a former chief justice of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court.\nBrown's only connection to Clarke was that his mother and her mother-in-law were childhood friends. Brown's daughter helped her with the research, \"because I had no idea where to start.\"\nA scrapbook containing some of Christina Brown's 15 successful nominations for the Order of Nova Scotia. (Michael Gorman/CBC)\nArmed with a mountain of information from the internet, Brown worked on the application and solicited letters of support from people who knew Clarke, but didn't know her.\nBrown has always asked the letter writers she approaches not to say anything to the nominees.\n\"I try to point out that the advisory council asks that the nominees not be contacted, in case it's not successful and then there's disappointment.\"\nThis year she is nominating seven people and she's already identified two people for next year. Brown said she looks at people's professional and personal accomplishments, their community service and other contributions to the province in determining whom to choose.\n\"I think about it year-round and I'm always on the lookout,\" she said.\nChristina Brown poses with a picture from the Order of Nova Scotia investiture ceremony for Sidney Crosby. Brown was one of two people to nominate the hockey superstar. (Michael Gorman/CBC)\nHer successful nominations read like a who's who of Nova Scotia.\nAlong with Clarke there's been Raylene Rankin, Muriel Duckworth, Budge Wilson, William Stanish, Wayne Adams, Richard Goldbloom, Arthur McDonald and Sidney Crosby (Brown was one of two people to nominate Crosby).\n'Mind-boggling' what some have done Brown said she usually has a pretty good idea of who the people she identifies are, although she admits her knowledge can be limited before the research really begins.\n\"Once you start digging, it's just absolutely mind-boggling what some of these people have done.\"\nLouis Deveau, the founder of Acadian Seaplants, said he only learned about Brown on the day of the investiture ceremony in 2015.\nHe said what Brown does is remarkable. \nChristina Brown was awarded the Diamond Jubilee Medal for her efforts to promote the Order of Nova Scotia. (Michael Gorman/CBC)\n\"We don't do what we do to get recognized,\" Deveau said. \"So when somebody that you don't know has seen that you're doing something of relevance and they nominate you for an honour, it's very impressive.\"\nAlexander MacLeod, the son of the late writer Alistair MacLeod, said Nova Scotia is lucky to have people such as Brown who \"care about the province's great victories.\" \nAlistair MacLeod was inducted into the Order of Nova Scotia posthumously in 2015. \n\"It's easy to stand up for someone you know, it's easy to stand up for your family, it's easy to stand up for your local heroes,\" Alexander MacLeod said.\n\"It's a different thing to stand up for someone that just matters sort of objectively for you.\"\nBrown's effort would have carried great weight with his father, Alexander MacLeod said.\n\"I think it would mean more to him than people know,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:20:09.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
