In August 2015 it was heartening to see masses of people organise in the space of a couple of hours to condemn the Australian Border Force, with protests in the city leading to a planned visa crackdown being abandoned by the federal government. \nIn 2016, when 267 asylum seekers in Australia faced deportation to offshore processing centres on Nauru or Manus Island, people came together to offer them sanctuary. \nBut there was nothing heartening about a protest that occurred on Wednesday outside of Flinders Street station. In the morning, about half a dozen homeless people remained at a makeshift camp outside the station, surrounded by their few belongings. As activists, protesters and onlookers joined that camp to protest their removal, numbers escalated into the hundreds and chaos ensued. \nThe ugly side of Melbourne’s activist movement was revealed, with misinformation and hysteria only worsening a desperate situation. 'I'm a beautiful person': Melbourne's pilloried homeless people speak Read more \nThe rough sleepers in Melbourne have been subject to cruelty these past few weeks. The Herald Sun wants them banned. An editorial read: “ With the filth intimidation and hygiene risks … there is enough to meet criteria for police to move in and move these vagrants on.” \nMany people, if not the Herald Sun, were rightfully outraged that homeless people were being framed as a problem that needed to be cleaned up rather than people in need of support and long-term solutions. \nComments made by the lord mayor of Melbourne City Council, Robert Doyle , to News Corp that he planned to introduce a bylaw banning homeless people from sleeping on city streets sparked further concern from social services and the community. \nAt an emergency meeting held last month which included Doyle, the housing minister, Martin Foley, and representatives from social services, Doyle said he was misquoted by News Corp and there were no plans to criminalise homelessness. \n“We will continue to offer housing, alcohol and drug and mental health referrals but we will warn people that if they refuse offers of support then we need to remove these large encampments from our streets,” Doyle said. \nThe state government also announced rough sleepers would have “immediate” access to 40 transitional housing units. The solutions aren’t perfect, but reform is under way. \nOver the past couple of weeks Melbourne City Council has been sending staff from the Salvation Army and Launch Housing to the station. A restoration of Flinders Street station has been scheduled for months, and for the safety of construction workers and homeless people at the site, the area does need to be cleared. \nI spoke to many of the Flinders Street station rough sleepers last week, and most said they would welcome offers of accommodation. It was clear to me when I returned to the station on Wednesday morning that the half dozen or so who remained were the most vulnerable of the vulnerable, those suffering from severe and untreated mental health issues and addiction. \nWhat they needed was intensive and specialist intervention, and that’s exactly what council had planned. Salvation Army workers, social workers and Launch Housing staff arrived to connect them to services. \nBut activists insisted the homeless at the station were being criminalised. They called on people to head down to the station to help the remaining rough sleepers resist being moved. As the crowd built, police moved in . I overheard one police officer explaining to a protester that social services were on standby to help people, but that was being made difficult by the crowds, who had begun chanting “homelessness is not a crime” and holding up placards. Police move in on homeless people and supporters at Melbourne camp Read more \nTourists and members of the public gathered around to gawk. They recorded homeless people on their iPhones, not only those who were protesting but those cowering under blankets as well. Anti-homeless people were attracted to the scene, with one man yelling at them to: “Make some sacrifices and get yourselves a bloody job.” \nThe scene descended into chaos and violence by the early afternoon. More police were brought in to separate the crowds and protesters from the homeless people and the social services trying to help them. \nFive people were arrested, four of them non-homeless protesters. One police officer was punched in the back of the head. Another man who was arrested had been ramming police with his mobility scooter. Another threw an object at police. \nActing commander for the north-west metro region, Stuart Bateson, was clearly frustrated. He said while most rough sleepers complied with police, a large crowd of protesters had resisted, exacerbating the situation. He added that many were serial protesters, “regular starters at any far left protest ... assaulting our members, yelling at our members, spitting on our members”. \n“We do not under any circumstances think we have solved the homeless issue,” Bateson added. \nBut assaulting police trying to help social services do their job is no way to help the homeless either. Spreading fear among an already vulnerable population by giving them misinformation that they are being criminalised is just cruel. Inviting chaos and a gawking public to watch as social workers try to carry out sensitive conversations with rough sleepers does nothing but rob them of their dignity and add to views that homeless people are violent. \nWe should absolutely be angry that in a city as prosperous as Melbourne, homelessness remains an issue. By all means, protest. But protest the lack of mental health outreach services, the shortage of addiction treatment beds, the limited long-term social housing options and the cruel media campaigns demonising the vulnerable. Donate to social services. Write to council and politicians demanding funding and solutions. \nJumping on a bandwagon of misinformation and becoming swept up in a crowd helps no one. The homeless need to be treated with compassion, but what protesters did yesterday was anything but.
