Plus, in case you missed last week's groundbreaking news, Queen Bey killed her Grammy performance while pregnant with twins. \nAfter a heartfelt introduction from her mother, Tina Knowles , Bey's number opened with holographic images reminiscent of her pregnancy photo shoot, complete with moving images of little Blue Ivy running around her legs. \nVIDEO: Beyoncé's Grammy Performance Intro \nBeyoncé herself stunned in a curve-hugging golden illusion dress, showcasing her growing baby bump. The songstress began her medley with \"Love Drought,\" sung over a Last Supper scene—we all held our breath as her chair tipped back over the edge, and collectively let out a sigh of relief as her feet landed safely on the ground again. \nThe Queen then went on to sing \"Sandcastles,\" looking more glam than ever as her devoted husband, Jay Z , and daughter cheered her on from the audience. We swear, the woman was glowing throughout the incredible performance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:05:20.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
