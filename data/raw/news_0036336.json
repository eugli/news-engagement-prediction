Ivanka Trump also attended the meeting and \"helped recruit participants and set the agenda,\" Associated Press reported.\nWhile Trump addressed the importance of women in the creation of economic growth, pictures from the event led Twitter to believe that she was swooning over Trudeau at the same time:\nIf you can find someone that will look at you like Ivanka does Trudeau, never let that person go #valentinesday2017\nEven Mic 's very own Jack Smith IV noticed her telling gaze:\nHappy Valentines Day! ???? I hope you've got someone who looks at you the way Ivanka Trump looks at Justin Trudeau.\nOthers tweeted: \"Roses are red, violets are blue, I wished I loved you as much as Ivanka Loves Trudeau #WhiteHouseCandyHearts\"\nRoses are Red Violets are Blue I wished I loved you as much as Ivanka loves Trudeau #WhiteHouseCandyHearts\nApparently, no one can blame Ivanka's admiration for the Canadian prime minister:\nLma Ivanka Trump looking at Justin Trudeau is me like yup, me too gurl. Me too.\nAnd Trump is not alone. During separate encounters with Trudeau, actress Emma Watson and Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton could not take their eyes off Trudeau, as this Twitter user suggests:\nNo one is safe from PM Steal Yo Girl!\nOthers recognized the \"hunger\" in Ivanka's eyes:\nIvanka you need to stop. @JustinTrudeau @IvankaTrump\nFormer NFL player Matthew A.
