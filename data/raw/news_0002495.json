These were made using folded kim jua (gold paper) and they signify ‘ bu bu gao sheng ’ (steady progress) or prosperity,” she said.\nAng added that her customers started shopping for the items about three days before the celebration.\nFrom dusk today, altars laden with food offerings and flowers, and flanked by sugarcane stalks, will be set up in front of the homes of devotees and they will wait for midnight, to pay homage to the deity.\nThe birthday of the Jade Emperor is an important date for the community. According to legend, the Hokkiens survived persecution in ancient China by hiding in a sugarcane plantation for nine days during one Chinese New Year period.\nOn the ninth day, which coincided with the Jade Emperor’s birthday, they emerged to find their enemies had gone. \nThey had been saved by the cover of sugarcane stalks.\nEver since then, Hokkiens have regarded this date as symbolic to their survival.\nA check by The Star at Chew Jetty in Weld Quay found Chew Jetty Kongsi chairman Chew Choon Seng overseeing the preparation of the ornate wooden structure that will house a statue of the Jade Emperor during the celebration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:13:19.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
