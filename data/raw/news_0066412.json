A picture showing First Daughter Ivanka Trump posing with Vladimir Putin and Wendi Murdoch was digitally manipulated. 712 A photograph show Ivanka Trump with Vladimir Putin and Wendi Murdoch. FALSE FALSE ORIGIN \nIn February 2017, an image circulated via social media purportedly showed President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka posing with Russian president Vladimir Putin and Wendi Murdoch, the Putin’s rumored girlfriend: \nThe image was frequently circulated with messages claiming it was proof that Donald Trump had colluded with Russia to win the 2016 U.S. presidential election. However, the photograph is a manipulated image and not a real picture of the First Daughter. \nThe original photograph depicted Ivanka Trump and Wendi Murdoch, but the male posing with them was film director Baz Luhrmann, not Vladimir Putin. It was taken by photographer Hannah Thomson at an after-party of the Costume Institute Gala and was included in Vogue magazine’s gallery displaying images from the best parties of 2015: \nThis fake image also promulgated the rumor that Murdoch, an old friend of Ivanka Trump’s, was dating Vladimir Putin. Murdoch denied that she was in a relationship with the Russian President in July 2016.
