Anushka posted her statement through a tweet on her Twitter page and also in a separate post on her Instagram profile. \n\n\nPutting to rest some rumours that have been doing the rounds for some days now pic.twitter.com/bqS498U1tC \n\n— Anushka Sharma (@AnushkaSharma) February 10, 2017 \nHere's the full statement: \n\n\"Putting to rest some rumours that have been doing the rounds for some days now. Phillauri is produced by Fox Star Studios & Clean Slate Films. So those TV channels/newspapers/websites claiming anything else, please check FACTS, practice responsible journalism & have some shame. By making such bogus claims and validating this rubbish by your so called 'source', not only are you disrespecting me & the hard work I have put in over the years to be where I am, but also, all the people who have worked on this film. Freedom of press comes with accountability & your fake sources are never accounted for. \n\nI have always led my career with dignity & often chose to maintain a dignified silence on many untruthful stories, that doesn't mean you can take my silence as my weakness and say anything without checking with me or my team! \n\nFor someone who makes a living out of maligning people, it must definitely be hard to believe that a person can stand on their own feet and do something meaningful with their life. \n\nAnd next time these same people come wanting to talk about 'women empowerment' and 'women in films today' do remember this is what you do to 'women in films' who are trying to change the narrative & take charge of their own careers. \n\nThis must be just another story for you but it's someone's life you are toying with. \n\nI am more than capable of producing and promoting my own films. Thank you.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:38:38.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
