Last year, UTA reportedly hosted an Oscars pre-party at the home of its chairman Jim Berkus for nominated clients and industry professionals. But in light of Trump’s actions and in consideration of Farhadi ― who won’t be attending the ceremony because Iran is one of the countries the ban includes ― UTA decided to do things differently. \nCelebrities across the industry initially reacted to Trump’s order with anger and harsh words of criticism , and it was a hot topic at the Screen Actors Guild Awards days later. \nAt the Golden Globes in early January, weeks before the ban, Meryl Streep spoke to the industry’s longtime acceptance of actors, directors, producers and writers from a variety of backgrounds. \n“You and all of us in this room, really, belong to the most vilified segments in American society right now. Think about it. Hollywood, foreigners, and the press,” Streep said. “But who are we? And, you know, what is Hollywood anyway? It’s just a bunch of people from other places.” Also on HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:33:01.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
