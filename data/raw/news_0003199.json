The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,\" he wrote in a note to employees. \"Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there's a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.\"\nThe move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday.
