Others accused him of being unduly pessimistic.\nThough it was telling his critics resorted to personal attacks rather than confront his arguments.\nSome of Sir John’s criticisms deserve consideration.\nHe was especially acute about the dangers of turning Britain into a tax haven if we cannot get the deal we want.\n“There is a choice to be made, a price to be paid; we cannot move to a radical enterprise economy without moving away from a welfare state,” he said, pointing out the people who are likely to be worst affected are those who voted to leave Europe in the belief it might improve their lives.\nThis is an argument many wish Labour would make more forcefully.\nSir John also cautioned about the difficulties of trying to achieve a sector by sector deal with the EU.\nThis, he noted, meant picking winners and losers.\nCo-incidentally, the boss of Nissan UK is up before the International Trade select committee today where he will be quizzed about the agreement, as yet unpublished, which persuaded the firm to continue manufacturing in the UK.\nThe Commons kicks off today with Treasury questions.\nThe Chancellor Philip Hammond yesterday slipped out that he wants Government departments to draw up plans for further cuts of up to 6% from 2019.\nSo much for the end of austerity.\nThe architect of austerity, George Osborne, is one of the speakers at the British Chambers of Commerce conference today.\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell and Business Secretary Greg Clark are also addressing the gathering.\nMr McDonnell is expected to outline plans for a £500million lifeline to support small companies hit by the rise in business rates .\n Conservative Party UKIP Nissan Motor Company, Ltd.
