The previous youngest was Norman Taurog, who won for Skippy at the age of 32 years and 260 days in 1931. \nLa La Land , which stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as wannabe stars in a Hollywood-set musical, is Chazelle’s third film as a director, after 2009’s Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench and 2014’s Whiplash; the latter won two major awards at the Sundance film festival and three Oscars, including best supporting actor for JK Simmons. \nChazelle had already won a string of directing awards for La La Land, including best director at the Golden Globes and the Baftas, and the outstanding directorial achievement award from the Directors Guild of America.
