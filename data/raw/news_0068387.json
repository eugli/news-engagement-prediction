Currently reading: BMC polls results tomorrow, will BJP-Sena alliance survive? #BMC Polls 2017 , #Mumbai , #BJP , #Shiv Sena India TV Politics Desk, Mumbai [ Published on: 22 Feb 2017, 14:12:50] The results of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and nine other civic bodies across Maharashtra will be declared tomorrow where the ruling BJP and Shiv Sena are pitted against each other after a gap of 20 long years. The results have the direct impact on Shiv Sena and BJP alliance, both in centre and state. \nVarious exit polls have predicted a neck-and-neck battle between the two parties. Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena, which has been ruling the 227-member BMC for the past 25 years, is leading by a slight margin. \nWhile the Sena is expected to get 86-92 seats, the ‘big brother’ of the ruling coalition at the state Secretariat BJP is likely to bag 80-88 seats. The Congress will be a distant third position with 30 to 34 seats whereas Raj Thackeraj’s MNS likely to be reduced to a single digit. \nBMC is the Asia’s richest civic body. A total of 55.28 % of voter turnout was recorded - making it the highest turnout for any elections since 1991. \nIn 2012, it notched just 44.7 per cent voting. \nControlled by the Shiv Sena and BJP for four terms, the BMC has a budget of Rs 37,052 crore for 2016-17 fiscal, catering to a population of around 18.30 million Mumbaikar. In comparison, neighbouring Goa's budget last year was around Rs 14,700 crore. \nThe total average voting across the municipal corporations in the state was 56 per cent and 69 per cent for Zila Parishads and Panchayat Samitis. The other nine civic bodies where polling was held yesterday include: Thane, Ulhasnagar, Nashik, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Solapur, Amravati, Akola and Nagpur. \nThe elections are also widely seen as a referendum on Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. For the BJP, the election is a virtual mid-term report card on its much-bandied issue of transparency and clean governance. An aggressive Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray has already put the BJP government ‘on notice period’ and said he will decide whether to continue the state-level alliance after the results. \nNationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar has ruled out support in such an eventuality and predicted mid-term assembly polls.
