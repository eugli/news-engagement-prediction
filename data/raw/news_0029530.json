O’Neil, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations. Yet she called it a positive development for the region, showing “the anticorruption movement in Latin America is gaining ground.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Perhaps the most spectacular case so far involves Alejandro Toledo , the president of Peru from 2001 to 2006, and a wanted man since a judge last week issued an arrest warrant on charges that he had accepted up to $35 million in bribes. Mr. Toledo’s whereabouts was unknown, and Peruvians have been captivated. On Sunday night, he surfaced on Twitter , where he posted a statement attesting his innocence and denied that he was hiding out. “I never fled from anything. When I left Peru, there were no Odebrecht charges against me, but they call me a ‘fugitive,’” he wrote, saying nothing of his location. The current Peruvian president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski , has asked President Trump to extradite Mr. Toledo should he be found in the United States.

A statue of Christ with arms outspread that overlooks the city’s coast was donated by the company. But Odebrecht has also reaped the benefits of its connections to the country. The Inter-Oceanic highway, for example, begun under Mr. Toledo’s administration, cost a total of $4.5 billion, four times over budget. The overruns were approved by an official who is also under investigation by prosecutors. Under Ollanta Humala , Mr. Kuczynski’s predecessor, Odebrecht began a yet-unfinished $7 billion natural gas pipeline to connect the Amazon to the coast by cutting through the Andes Mountains. Another former president, Alan García, oversaw the bidding for a subway line in Lima, which Odebrecht won and constructed. If Mr. Toledo is apprehended and convicted, he would be the second Peruvian president behind bars, after Alberto K. Fujimori, the country’s former dictator who was convicted of human rights abuses. “For Peru, like any other country, even the possibility of having two presidents as prisoners is an embarrassment,” Marisol Pérez Tello, the country’s justice minister, said in an interview. But she added, “I think this is an important moment to think about our ability to institutionalize the fight against corruption.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
