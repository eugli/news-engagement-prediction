On Wednesday, a dancer dressed in a house costume fell off the stage during Katy Perry‘s BRIT Awards performance in London. Perry was performing her new single, “Chained to the Rhythm,” on a set covered by dancers dressed in massive white-house costumes, later joined by Skip Marley. At one point, the dancers had to bop around two large skeleton props—an apparent reference to Donald Trump and Theresa May . But who could pay any mind to the performance‘s political message after one of the dancers took a step too far, accidentally falling off the stage and onto the spectators below? A clip of the moment was quickly posted on Twitter, and immediately started spreading like wildfire. Well, this is one way to bring the house down, Katy Perry. Representatives for the singer have not responded to Vanity Fair ‘s request for comment. \nhttps://twitter.com/KatyPVenezuela/status/834512751254978560 Of course, only time will tell if Falling House (the Fallen House? The Felled House? Still so much potential here) is as iconic and enduring as Left Shark, the bumbling dancer in a shark costume who didn‘t seem prepared for Perry‘s 2016 Super Bowl performance. Left Shark has its own Wikipedia page . Left Shark has been immortalized in tattoo form ( seriously ). Everyone remembers where they were when they first laid eyes upon the shark of the left. However, the Falling House is in very good company. In 2015, Madonna fell off the stage at this very awards show while performing her new single “Living for Love,” pulled backward down a flight of stairs after her cape got caught on one of her dancers. The superstar brushed it off and kept performing, though it's hoped she‘ll never again forget the sage wisdom of Edna Mose— no capes .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:49:57.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
