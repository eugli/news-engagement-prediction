(Supplied: Roderick Mickens/American Museum of Natural History) \nThousands of turquoise and shell beads and pendants, as well as abalone shells and a conch shell trumpet, had been found with the skeletal remains. \n\"The abundance of turquoise alone makes this the richest burial known in the North American south west,\" the scientists said, in the study published in the journal Nature Communications . \nThe genetic analysis of nine of the remains found the individuals had identical mitochondrial genomes. \nThese genomes can only be inherited through mothers, which means the individuals all shared maternal ancestry. \nRadiocarbon dating and analysis of the nuclear genome data also found mother-daughter and grandmother-grandson relationships. \n\"Women living at Pueblo Bonito likely had power and a great deal of influence on what was happening in society,\" the study's lead author, Douglas Kennett, said. Were they the only ancient society with a maternal dynasty? \nWhile most ancient societies were ruled by a patrilineal dynasty — meaning power was passed through the father's line — the Lycians of ancient Turkey were another matrilineal society. \nThe evidence for a maternal dynasty does not suggest the society was dominated by women, Dr Kennett said. \nBut it does show women were given an important role, and that men were only considered elite if they were the sons of elite women. \n\"Both men and women were influential, and were leaders in the Chaco society, but basically that influence was passed along the maternal line,\" Dr Kennett said. \nThis study is the first time both archaeological and DNA analyses have been used to determine the hereditary relationships within an elite lineage. \nThe society lacked a written system, which means scientists are still unsure on further details about how the society was organised. \nIt is also not clear if the remains represent all of Chacoan society or just one elite family within the society.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:12:24.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
