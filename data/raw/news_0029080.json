(Getty Images) \nHull City defender Andy Robertson has revealed that Mark Clattenburg apologised at half-time for awarding Alexis Sanchez’s ‘handball’ goal. \nThe Gunners ran out 2-0 winners over the Tigers at the Emirates Stadium but took the lead in the first half through controversial circumstances as the ball rebounded in off Sanchez’s hand at close rage. \nBut while the goal did not appear to be a deliberate handball, Robertson has revealed that Clattenburg said sorry to the Hull players for allowing the goal to stand. \n‘Yeah, it was handball, when we came out at half-time the referee’s apologised to us and said it was handball,’ the Scot told Sky Sports. Sanchez did not appear to deliberately handle the ball. (Getty Images) \n‘He’s obviously looked at it at half-time and seen he’s in the wrong. \n‘It happens so quick, it’s a tough one for the ref, you’ve got to kind of feel sorry for them. \n‘At the end of the day, these decisions don’t really go for you when you go to these big stadiums and that’s killed us at the end of the day. Clattenburg apologised for awarding the goal, claims Robertson. (AFP/Getty Images) \n‘He [Clattenburg] said he wasn’t 100% sure, obviously we can argue then he shouldn’t have given the goal if he wasn’t 100% sure. \n‘But I think he argued the other way that if he wasn’t 100% sure he had to give the goal. \n‘That’s the explanation he gave us, obviously not many referees admit they are wrong, it’s good but it doesn’t make it any better.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:41:02.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
