GETTY In 2007 the EU spent millions for celebrations in Berlin for the 50th anniversary \nThe first Italian event to promote the anniversary was the meeting \"From Rome to Lisbon and beyond – Building a new political community\", which was held on 11th April 2016 at the Chamber of Deputies. \nAccording to an article in the Sunday Telegraph, UK diplomats have considered the calls carefully and are unlikely to trigger Article 50 on March 25. \nIndeed Theresa May is instead said to be considering giving the EU notice that the UK is to leave two weeks earlier on March 9th in order to avoid tensions. GETTY The Treaty of Rome was celebrated by Angela Merkel in Berlin 10 years ago \nAn unnamed UK minister added: “Our colleagues on the Continent are concerned we might trigger it on that date. \n\"You could see what the temptation is, can’t you? \n“But it might be a bit provocative.” \nLast year Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni who was then foreign minister will hosted a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the six founders of the European Union at the Villa Madama in Rome, in anticipation of the celebrations for the 60th anniversary. GETTY In 2007 the ECB produced coins to mark the 50th anniversary \nThe meeting looked at how the nation states could strengthen the European Union despite the historic Brexit vote. \nThe anniversary of the signing of the historic treaty takes place on March 25 as the EU plans a series of celebratory events to mark the occasion. \nThe official logo for the 60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, as well as the hashtag for initiatives #Roma2017 were presented on 31st May last year.
