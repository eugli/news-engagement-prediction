Highs will be in the mid 60s. \n“Back into the 70s Thursday, Friday and Saturday with the possibility of showers Saturday afternoon and a cooler Sunday at 58, but it doesn’t stay cool long,” Fishel said \nFishel said the only cool weather in the near future will be over the weekend. \n“A cold front will come through,” Fishel said. “It’s going to get us back within striking distance of normal. It won’t be frigid, but you will notice it Saturday night and Sunday.” \nTemperatures will be right back in the 70s by next Tuesday and Wednesday. \n“After that cooling Monday and Sunday, it’s another warm week coming in from the south and the west.” Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:04:08.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
