(Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) More Even if Justin Timberlake doesn't take home his first Oscar tonight (Feb. 26), he can leave knowing he completely dominated the Oscars stage. Opening the show with his Trolls​ track -- and best original song nominee -- \"Can't Stop the Feeling!,\" Timberlake brought the crowd to their feet right off the bat and began the night with a bang (even giving his former Mickey Mouse Club​ cohort Ryan Gosling a hug along the way). Starting the performance in the front corridor of the Dolby Theatre and dancing his way down the stairs to the stage, Timberlake continued the grooving with a hoard of backup dancers behind him. He even put a new spin on the chart-topping tune, adding in slight variations in his vocals as well as an R&B breakdown -- including a little Bill Withers \"Lovely Day\" excerpt. After delivering quite the crowd-pleasing, colorful performance, Timberlake ended his show opener in perhaps the most adorable way possible: a sweet smooch with wife Jessica Biel (cue the awws). Watch a clip of Timberlake's flawless \"Can't Stop the Feeling\" performance above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:01:17.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
