(AP) – A ferret is recovering after being fitted with a pacemaker during a rare surgery at Kansas State University. \nThe 4-year-old ferret, named Zelda, is owned by Carl Hobi of Olathe, who took her to the Veterinary Health Center in Manhattan, Kansas, after Christmas. Zelda had a third-degree block in her heart, which caused a low heartbeat and a lack of energy. \nThe university said tests determined Zelda was a good candidate for a pacemaker, although it had to be special ordered because of her veins’ small size. \nThe university says Zelda was released two days after the surgery and should enjoy a normal ferret lifespan, which the school’s veterinary college says generally is about 10 years. \nIt was the first time the center implanted a pacemaker in a ferret. \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.   rewritten or redistributed.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:17:02.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
