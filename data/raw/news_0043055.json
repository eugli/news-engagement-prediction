The Cabinet has only relaxed it,\" he said. \nIn line with a previous order, the vacant posts of freedom fighter quota will have to be preserved. \nThe Public Service Commission (PSC) recommended relaxing the rule for 36th BCS because there were only 82 candidates from the quotas against 737 posts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:42:06.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
