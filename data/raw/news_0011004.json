ADVERTISEMENT \nJee was abducted and killed the same day on Oct. 18, 2016 inside the Philippine National Police’s (PNP) main headquarters in Camp Crame. \nThe perpetrators still asked the family for an P8-million ransom of which P5-million was given. \nAguirre said it appeared that the kidnapping was an afterthought. \n“If the target is to ask for ransom, why would you kill the victim a few hours after abducting him,” Aguirre asked. \nHe said the Korean mafia theory will also be covered by the Philippine National Police-National Bureau of Investigation joint task force that is handling the Jee Ick-joo slay case. \n“Every angle and theory will be covered by the Joint Investigation,” Aguirre said.
