Officers say they were targeting a number of road offences known as the \"fatal four\". They include drink and drug driving, using mobile devices such as phones behind the wheel; inappropriate speed, and not wearing a seatbelt.\nThe operation Allied Wolf, which has taken place over the last two days, saw officers focussing their attention on Exeter City Centre, the M5, A38 and A30 arterial routes into the city after a number of serious or fatal collisions in the area. Police used both marked and unmarked vehicles, along with Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology.\nDuring the two days:\n121 vehicles were stopped over the two days 118 drivers were given fixed penalties for excess speed 11 drivers were found to not be wearing a seatbelt Other people found breaching road safety rules were:\n24 drivers were found to have no insurance 5 vehicles were seized 4 divers were found with no license 6 were found to have no valid MOT 5 vehicles were seized 8 OSCO’s for using a mobile device behind the wheel 1 vehicle was prohibited from the road for being in a dangerous condition 2 commercial drivers were found to have exceeded their allowed driving hours This tyre that is beginning to delaminate was found on a van driving on the A30 Credit: Devon & Cornwall Police “The overall aim of Operation Allied Wolf is road casualty reduction, at the same time helping to minimise crime and traffic related incidents in the area.\nI would like to take this opportunity to remind people that legislation relating to using a mobile device while driving changes on 1st March this year. Penalties will double to a £200 fine and 6 points on your license. Newer drivers, and those who already have points on their license, may find themselves off the road very quickly indeed if caught.\nYou can be sure that early in March, and throughout the year, we will be paying particular attention to this habit which is as unacceptable and as dangerous as driving when impaired though alcohol.”\n– Chief Inspector Leisk Exeter Devon", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T19:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:41:14.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
