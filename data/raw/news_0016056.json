Rec In typical Knicks fashion, New York had cut a onetime 27-point Cavaliers lead to just five. Only 44 seconds remained in the fourth quarter, and all the momentum was on their side. The only thing the Knicks needed was a stop. Not on LeBron James’ watch. James blew past rookie center Willy Hernangomez , commanding weak side help from Kristaps Porzingis. He then whisked a pass over the top of Porzingis’ dome to find a wide open Kevin Love in the short corner. Game, blouses. Love’s triple extended Cleveland’s lead to eight, a lead inevitably proving insurmountable. James finished with 32 points on 12-for-20 shooting, including 4-for-8 on threes, as well as 10 dimes and five rebounds as the Cavaliers held off the Knicks on Saturday, 111-104. The King is averaging 25.7 points, 8.6 assists and 8.0 rebounds per game for a top-seeded Cleveland team (34-15). And it was his unmatched court vision that was on full display at Madison Square Garden.
