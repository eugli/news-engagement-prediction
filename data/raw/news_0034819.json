(Photo: April Morganroth/The Republic) \n113 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE A 17-year-old was killed and a 15-year-old was critically injured when gunfire broke out Monday night in Phoenix.\nPolice remained at the scene in a residential area near 33rd and Northern avenues Tuesday until about 9:30 a.m.\nSgt. Vince Lewis, a Phoenix police spokesman, said the teenage boys were outside a home on the 3300 block of west Harmont Drive around 7:45 p.m. when they were approached by two people.\nLewis said one of the people pulled out a gun and shot both teens. The gunman and his companion fled.\nSeveral nearby neighbors reported hearing about six or seven shots fired.\n\"I saw the first car pull up and try to drag someone into it but couldn't,\" said April Moreno, 54, who lives nearby. \"And then I heard, 'Get the [explicit] outta here!'\"\n“About 50 people started scattering back to their homes when the shots started going off. ... And next thing I saw was the black and white cars drive off, and then people started to cry.”\nApril Moreno, neighbor Moreno and her boyfriend, Charlie Thompson, 57, had just returned from the nearby Safeway and were putting their groceries away when Moreno said she saw people on the street below arguing from her upstairs kitchen window.\n\"I saw a couple of young men over there, and it was getting pretty heated,\" Thompson said. \"But I walked away from the kitchen window to sit down in the living room.\"\nThompson and Moreno said that, at one point, they saw someone being dragged into a car that took off. The car returned and someone was forced from the vehicle, they said.\nMoreno said she was still watching the incident unfold from her kitchen window when, suddenly, someone inside one of two vehicles circling the area began shooting.\n\"About 50 people started scattering back to their homes when the shots started going off,\" Moreno said. \"And next thing I saw was the black and white cars drive off, and then people started to cry.\"\nMoreno said she didn't get a very good look at the two men that were driving the cars or who had shot the teens because there were no street lights, but she said she could tell that they were men.\nBrittany Brown, 27, a nearby neighbor said, \"I yelled, 'Get down, get down!' \" to her mother and daughter when she heard the shots fired. \"When I looked out my window, I saw a black and white car speed off.\"\nBrown said that she could hear the shots as clear as day in her home about a half block away because the neighborhood echos so much.\nSeveral residents reported seeing the police helicopters hovering over the one-way-in, one-way-out neighborhood. They said it took longer than 10 minutes for police to get to the scene.\nCheck back with azcentral.com for more details. \nPhoenix police crime-scene response teams finish clearing the scene of a shooting near 33rd and Northern avenues that killed one teen and critically injured another on Feb. 14, 2017.
