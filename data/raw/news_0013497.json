Media Drum World 14 Denbigh Asylum was closed in 1995 and has been crumbling ever since \nBetween 1942 and 1944, more than 20 patients had prefrontal lobotomies – where part of the brain is removed as a treatment for insanity – and one died during the barbaric op. \nThe listed building, designed by architect Thomas Full James, was built in 1848 but was designated for closure by MP Enoch Powell in 1960 and finally closed in 1995. \nIn 2011, the local council spent £939,000 to stop the building collapsing and in 2013 a compulsory purchase order was served on the building. \nOwnership has yet to be transferred to the council and the site remains derelict.
