Colorado law currently only requires officers be residents. \n“Someone who is a citizen of another country; they owe their allegiance to that country, and yet law enforcement officers are required to take an oath to support and defend the constitution of the United States instead of Colorado. There is an inherent inconsistency in that,” said Sen. Bob Gardner, R-Colorado Springs. \nGardner says he’s aware of 25 officers in Colorado who aren’t U.S. citizens. \nAll federal agents are required to be citizens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:12:54.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
