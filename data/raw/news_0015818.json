Spanish activists put the blame on the government of Ukraine, claiming that Kiev have \"started a punitive operation against the civilian population of Donbas, violating the Minsk agreements that call to end the use of heavy weapons,\" Maestro explained. \"We blame the European Union for aiding the government created in a coup and supported by the people with Nazi views,\" she stated. \nThe activists, holding signs \"Donbass Will Win!\" and \"Fascism Go Away From Donbass!\", called for the Spanish government to \"stop political and military support, both direct and indirect, through the EU and NATO, for the criminal government in Kiev\". \"We as internationalists and anti-fascist want to express our support to Donbass. We remember that Madrid owes the Ukrainians that came to Spain to fight against the Francoism during the Civil War [1936-1939],\" Maestro added. \nThe news comes as the Ukrainian forces resumed heavy shelling of the residential areas of Donetsk on Sunday, deploying additional troops closer to the borders of the self-proclaimed republics in the east of the country. © AP Photo/ Evgeniy Maloletka Ukrainian Lawmaker Calls Out Poroshenko for Blowing Pre-Election Peace Promises The situation in the Donetsk region has escalated over the past few days, in particular near the town of Avdiivka, with clashes happening between Kiev forces and local militias.

Both conflicting parties have suffered casualties and accuse each other of initiating the violence.\nThe breakout of hostilities in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 as a local counter-reaction to the West-sponsored Maidan coup in Kiev that had toppled legitimate President Viktor Yanukovych in February. Residents of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions held independence referendums and proclaimed the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.
