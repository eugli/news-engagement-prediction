Armed with a spiked helmet reminiscent of Lord of the Ring 's Sauron, and skewers erupting out of his puckered, dried flesh, Winslow the walker proved to be a worthy adversary to Rick, though he ultimately perished at the bottom of a trash pile. The Ultimate 'The Walking Dead' Season 7 Guide: News, Recaps, Promos & All You Need To Know \nKept in something that looks vaguely like an arena, it seemed as though the community were almost keeping the walker in the enclosed space as a sort of challenge to visitors, at least that's what can be gathered by the decomposed human skeleton already in the pit. \nGreg Nicotero and his special effects makeup team — including Gino Crognale, who not only worked on the walker effects but also ended up playing Winslow — planned out Winslow's appearance very carefully, and the executive producer recently shared a number of images to Instagram documenting the process from concept art, to initial props to the final product: \nBut aside from just looking awesome, actress Pollyanna McIntosh has revealed that Winslow might be more than just a challenge, and that his backstory might be told in future episodes. \nSpeaking to Comicbook.com, McIntosh hinted that she knew \"who he is\" and \"who he was,\" though couldn't reveal any more than that. McIntosh said: \n\"Unfortunately, I can't tell you anything about it -- or not unfortunately, because it's more exciting for the fans, which I'm one of, to know that there are secrets kept so that the show can be as good as it is.\" \nSo with McIntosh keeping mum, it falls to us to do our own theorizing on who Winslow was before he was zombified, and why he was kept by the group. Take a look below at our five best guesses and let us know in the comments which theory you think could be correct — and before you guess he was the owner of the houseboat Rick and Aaron raided, his name was Leslie William Starton, so he's firmly out of the running. The original leader of the Heapsters \nWhile Jadis is very much the leader of the group now, if there's one thing we know about the zombie apocalypse it's that people die all the freakin' time. The junkyard group (who according to McIntosh are called \"the Heapsters\") have been very busy since the apocalypse, quietly taking supplies and establishing their vast territory. It makes sense that if Winslow was the original leader, and died at some point (either by bite or maybe of tetanus given that they're living in a literally garbage pit), he might be kept on as a sort of 'mascot' for the group. \nSee also: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:08:20.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
