(Photo: Jessica Boehm/The Republic) \n24 CONNECT TWEET 7 LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE A private university plans to bring a true college-campus vibe to Surprise, with amenities like collegiate sports expected as soon as this fall and dormitories within a year.\nSurprise and Ottawa University officials announced Friday that the non-profit Christian university based in Kansas will develop a 35-acre campus next to the city's civic center. The campus will be one of the biggest additions to the northwest Valley suburb's ambitions to grow a downtown from raw desert.\n\"Today, Surprise is a college town,\" Mayor Sharon Wolcott said at the dedication event.\nWolcott said higher-education options give \"us another shot at keeping (students) here.\" Additional skilled, young workers will stimulate business opportunities in the West Valley, she said.\nThe university aims to enroll 250 students by August and plans to house 3,000 residential students in the next 10 years, according to President Kevin Eichner. \nEichner said he expects the first phase of construction to begin imminently, but there are some financial and infrastructure details that have yet to be negotiated, according to the city.\nAfter 40 years, a campus Ottawa University has been in Arizona for 40 years, focused on classes for adult students in person and online in Surprise, Phoenix and Queen Creek. These programs have generated about 8,300 Arizona alumni — making the Valley the largest Ottawa alumni base in the country, according to Eichner.\nOttawa University Arizona will now provide a traditional, four-year college experience with undergraduate and graduate degrees from four schools: business, education, arts and sciences, and health and applied sciences.\nA rendering of the Ottawa University campus planned in Surprise.   (Photo: Ottawa University) \nClasses will begin in August in the 26,000-square-foot former \"Communiversity\" building in Surprise, where Ottawa has offered adult education for the past eight years.\nThe Surprise campus — Ottawa's first residential campus outside of Ottawa, Kan. — is expected to eventually include dormitories, an indoor activity center, dining options, conference space and athletic fields, including a stadium, for 19 varsity sports.\nThe university is working toward National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics designation.The athletic teams will be called the \"Ottawa Spirit\" and the mascot will be a grey wolf.\n\"It will give those student athletes in the Valley and Southern California and Nevada … an opportunity to stay a little closer to home and continue (to) do that thing that they love so much while they get a first-class education,\" Eichner said.\nAll varsity sports will begin in August with competitive schedules, with the exception of football, which will start with a redshirt season. The university will use sports facilities owned by the city and surrounding high schools until it develops its own, Eichner said.\nThe university has contracts with hotels in Surprise to house the first batch of students this fall, but some student housing should be ready within the first year, he said.\nAnnual tuition at the Surprise campus will be $26,000, but Eichner said he expects very few students to pay the full amount.\n\"We have a very, very generous scholarship program including a special scholarship for employees of the city and also Surprise residents. We want to be the college for the West Valley. That's our goal,\" he said.\nGetting established Several other private schools from the Midwest and East Coast have had mixed success after entering the Valley higher education market. In Mesa, city officials enticed five far-flung liberal-arts schools to open campuses in the city in short order. Within three years, two of the five had cut their losses and left town after disappointing enrollments.\nOttawa University President Kevin Eichner announces plans Feb. 17, 2017, to build a residential campus for the private Christian university in downtown Surprise.   (Photo: Jessica Boehm/The Republic) \nEichner said the other universities that \"parachute into the Valley\" have had very different models than his university.\n\"I don't think we'd be doing this if we hadn't been here for 40 years. We already have 1,000 (adult) students so we're not trying to plant a flag and grow from zero,\" Eichner said.\nRELATED: West Valley college options continue to grow | Goldwater sues Peoria over subsidies to Huntington University \nHe said another key difference between Ottawa University and other private universities in the metro Phoenix — including Gilbert's Saint Xavier , the most recent university to walk away from the Valley — is the focus on athletics and student activities from day one.\n\"It is far more than just another Midwestern university attempting to attract and serve students in temporarily rented space somewhere in this Valley,\" Eichner said. \"Our intent here is nothing less than to create something extraordinary.\"\nPaying for the campus Eichner said the first phase of the campus, which will include initial student housing and athletic facilities, a dining hall and an indoor recreation space is expected to cost $20 million.\nHe said the university will lease the land from the city at \"market value\" and noted that Ottawa will \"pretty much\" pay for the entire campus itself.\n\"There's no gift in this deal,\" he said.\nBut Surprise officials said the city does plan to contribute financial support to the university — they just don't know how much or in what way yet.\nEconomic Development Manager Mike Hoover said, \"The city has not identified specific funds that it will be dedicating to the university at this time, but we will work with the university as it goes through its transition.\" Any financial support would need council approval.\nWolcott noted that much of the city's financial contribution will likely come by way of infrastructure improvements such as constructing roads and sewer lines on the currently empty lots. She said it's typical for the city to split the burden of these costs with a developer on large projects like this.\nShe said the council will ensure that the city and its residents benefit from any financial help the city gives the university.\n\"I think that what we have done is made certain that every penny of public money that is invested in this project has at least a dollar-for-dollar return. It's important that the public investment yield a public return,\" Wolcott said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:05:13.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
