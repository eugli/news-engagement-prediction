Once again, the RUU355 will be tabled by either (PAS president) Datuk Seri Hadi Abdul Awang or the Government's side. \n\"But most importantly, the amendments need to be supported and approved in Parliament and the people need to keep the momentum going,\" he said. \nThe proposed amendments have been met with criticism from civil society groups and several political parties as there are concerns that it will affect non-Muslims. \nPAS, on the other hand, insist that the amendments will not infringe on the rights of non-Muslims and as such non-Muslims should have nothing to fear.
