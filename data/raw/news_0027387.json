A newly refurbished skatepark in Kampung Sungai Kantan. \n“My son has been pestering me to bring him here,” said a father of a nine-year-old who was seen slipping and sliding on a pair of inline skates, obviously enjoying himself. \nA group of older boys, sitting on a bank and watching a friend skateboarding down a flight of stairs said this was their latest hangout. \n“This is something we have been wanting for a long time,” said Sungai Kantan resident Daniel Ikhwan Badrul Hisham, 15. \nGiving a professional take is certified skateboarding instructor Fairuzal Hamid Abdul Rahman, who represented Malaysia in the vert ramp category during the 2011 X Games. \n“The skatepark is suitable for street and transitional skating. \n“This will be a good place to practise basic moves. \n“A spotlight allows night skating as well,” said Fairuzal who gives lessons here every Sunday morning. \nThe completion of the two-month-old facility has drawn skating fans from far and wide. \nMuhd Nur Imran Hanizam, a law enforcement student at a private college in Petaling Jaya, said he had come all the way from Batu Kikir, Kuala Pilah. \nArif Akmal, a private tutor residing in Beranang, said the new park was nearer to his home as previously, he had to take a 45-minute drive to the Putrajaya Challenge Park. \nInternational skateboarding judge Mariss Khan, a Kajang native, traced the history of this extreme sport facility, located in a traditional Malay village with a population of 5,000. \nThe skating wave arrived in Kajang in the late 1980s. \nAs there was no fixed spot, the shoplot walkways in Kajang town were where skaters tested their wheels. \nBetween 1993 and 1994, skaters congregated at the square in front of the Dato Nazir Building. \nOn weekend evenings, as many of 30 of them could be seen practising their tricks there. \nSpace constraints saw the group moving to an abandoned street hockey rink, the site of the current skate park. \nSungai Kantan village chief Mohd Khalid Redzuan remembered seeing skaters cleaning up the rink which was then buried in metres-deep mud and using planks to make ramps. \nUlu Langat Umno division chief Datuk Johan Abdul Aziz was councillor when the local authorities stepped in to build concrete ramps and metal rails in 2000. \n“We felt that it was only right that we should do something because it involved the youth,” said Johan. \nBut the skating community was not satisfied with the construction work. \nThey said the designers had not adhered to technical specifications. \nThen in 2015, Mariss, who was a regular at workshops organised by an international sports fashion label, got wind that the corporate social responsibility division was looking for a skatepark to refurbish. \n“They were considering two other places — a park in Tanah Rata, Cameron Highlands, and Taman Metropolitan Skateboard Park — until I mentioned Sungai Kantan,” said Mariss. \nConstruction took about a year and the project is a collaboration between Converse, Kajang Municipal Council (MPKj) and Mariss, who designed and constructed the park. \nSince its completion, Mariss has yet to try out his own board here. \n“There was just no place. The place is full every evening,” said the father of three who can only sit back and watch when his sons, aged seven and four, play. \nHowever, Sungai Kantan’s latest feature has yet to get the official nod from MPKj. \n“The skatepark is not fully completed. We still need to put up disclaimer boards and fencing as the park is just beside a main road. \n“We will also need to highlight some safety rules. \n“So until these things are done, the park has not officially opened to the public yet,” said MPKj corporate planning and public relations unit administrative officer Kamarul Izlan Sulaiman. \nMohd Khalid said the current situation was perplexing as construction work for the skatepark had ripped up the children’s playground. \n“Who will be in charge of managing this skatepark when it needs cleaning? Who will see that the grass is replanted and the earth is levelled? \n“Will it fall under the responsibility of the Village Development and Security Committee, MPKj, Mariss or Converse? \n“It is important to make this clear because more visitors are coming to our park. \n“We will also have to address issues such as additional public toilets and rubbish management,” he said. \nAnother concern is a row of food stalls next to the skatepark. \nMohd Khalid said the open pans of hot oil used for frying may pose a danger to skaters. \nHe hoped the authorities will act fast to move them into a council food court next to the Sungai Kantan community hall. \nJohan said he hoped to see more of such projects built in Selangor as facilities for the youth could steer them away from unhealthy activities especially drug addiction. \nHe said the Ulu Langat area saw as many as seven cases of drug abuse a day at present, mostly involving teenagers and young adults.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:02:35.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
