By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Published:February 14, 2017 10:44 am Chennai: Tamil Nadu chief minister and AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa along with her close aide Sasikala Natarajan. PTI Photo \nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday convicted Sasikala Natarajan under charges of the disproportionate assets case. The much awaited verdict would eventually decide the fate of the Tamil Nadu government as if convicted, Sasikala will not be allowed to take over as chief minister. The disproportionate asset case against Jayalalithaa goes way back to her chief ministerial tenure that began in 1991. Reports against her suggested that she misused her office to accrue properties worth more than Rs 66 crore, that did not add up to her known sources of income. The case had particularly strengthened against her when her foster son got married in 1996 in an extravagant wedding ceremony. The properties under purview include large tracts of agricultural land in Tamil Nadu, a tea estate in Nilgiris, a large number of luxury cars, jewellery valuing crores of rupees and cash in banks. The trial of the case has been going on for the last 20 years and was shifted outside Chennai by the opposition party, DMK for the sake of a fairer jurisdiction. \nOn being convicted , the power struggle in the state would shift in favour of Pannerselvam. On the contrary, in case of an acquittal, Sasikala’s claims to the chief ministerial post would have been further strengthened. Proceedings against Jayalalithaa would be abated due to her demise last year. \nHere is a brief timeline of the disproportionate assets case \nJune 14, 1996- Subramanian Swamy filed a case against Jayalalithaa’s acquisition of wealth \nJune 18, 1996- The DMK led government filed an FIR against the former chief minister \nJune 4, 1997- Chargesheet filed against Jayalalithaa, Sasikala, Ilavarasi and Sudhakaran \nMay 14, 2001- Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK was voted back to power in Tamil Nadu \nFebruary 28, 2003- A special appeal to the Supreme Court is filed by the DMK to shift the case outside Tamil Nadu for fairer proceedings \nNovember 18, 2003- The Supreme Court directed the case to be transferred to Bangalore \nMarch 2005- The trial started in Bangalore \nSeptember 27, 2014- The court convicted Jayalalithaa, Sasikala and the others under charges of illegal property acquisition.
