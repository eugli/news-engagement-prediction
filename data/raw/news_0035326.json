External Link: Richard Keys tweet \nThe Iranian stamp in Yorke's passport related to him playing in a charity match in Tehran, in 2015. \nThat charity match in Tehran featured Yorke on a World Stars team that also included Luis Figo, Roberto Carlos, Fabio Cannavaro, Marcel Desailly and Edgar Davids. \nThe ban has since been suspended in a series of court rulings for constitutional reasons but Yorke still claims to have been prevented from entering the country. \nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:11:48.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
