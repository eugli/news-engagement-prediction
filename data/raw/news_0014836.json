Ezra Shaw/Getty Images Lady Gaga thought she'd drop in on Super Bowl LI Sunday night. Literally.\nThe retractable roof at Mercedes-Benz Stadium opened up so the singer could make a Spider-Man-like appearance, leaping from the roof to the stage below.\nBefore making the jump, she performed a brief patriotic medley, singing bits of \"God Bless America\" and \"This Land Is Your Land,\" and quoting the Pledge of Allegiance before making the impressive jump.\nAfter landing, Gaga performed a variety of her hits, including \"Born This Way\" and \"Bad Romance.\" She encouraged her Houston audience to roar at their home-state \"Poker Face\" opening line, \"I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please.\"\nGaga was backed not just by dancers and singers, but by 300 lit-up drones that shone like stars in the night sky.\nGaga started the show in a glittery bodysuit, later adding a gold jacket with spiked shoulders, then stripping down to football shoulder pads, a bare belly and sparkly shorts.\nShe ended her concert with not only a dramatic mic drop while standing in high heels atop a tower with flames flashing behind her, but by catching a football.

An ad for the new NatGeo series \"Genius\" showed an actor dressed as Albert Einstein playing Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" on the violin -- and it sounded pretty good!\nTechnically Literate : Original works of short fiction with unique perspectives on tech, exclusively on CNET. \nSolving for XX : The industry seeks to overcome outdated ideas about \"women in tech.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:32:19.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
