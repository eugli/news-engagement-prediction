GETTY House Speaker Paul Ryan said he could not find evidence to back Trump's claims \nBut the state Bureau of Elections said human error, not fraud or equipment failure, caused mismatches between the number of ballots. \nWithin Detroit alone, 14 of the 31 cases of fraud were found. But Mr Thomas claimed there was no “pervasive fraud” in their audit of the region. \nInstead he felt that poll workers lacked sufficient training which in turn caused “widespread performance issues”.
