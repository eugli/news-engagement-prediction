From left, scrapbook teacher Tracey Reynolds, owner Patsy Clarkin, and Shirley McCarthy. \nWaikato scrapbook stores are leading a nationwide cabal to take on operators big and small cutting them out. \n﻿ Tired of hearing about \"poor old retail\", Paperzone owner Patsy Clarkin opened her remodelled Frankton store with renewed enthusiasm on Tuesday. \n\"We've decided we're going to fight back, and stick together.\" CHRISTEL YARDLEY/FAIRFAX NZ \nPaperzone is one of four scrapbook stores from around the country that have joined together to share ideas about tackling an increasingly challenging market. \nRetail is a \"cold, hard\" world and the paper craft stores are competing with operators on both ends of the market. \nREAD MORE: \nThe big chain stores have low prices, but it's the small online importers that \"screw it up\", Clarkin said. CHRISTEL YARDLEY/FAIRFAX NZ \nSmall retailers need a point of difference to survive, Paperzone owner Patsy Clarkin says. Her craft paper line, Paper-Arts, is exclusive to her store. \n\"You've got the people who are running home-based businesses with absolutely no overheads, and they're not paying GST or the duty that we pay.\" \nIn response, Clarkin has joined forces with four other stores: Imagine If in Morrinsville, Scrapaholics and Create in Auckland, and Artfull Crafts in Timaru. \nThe stores are sharing ideas, wholesaling efforts and cross-promoting wares. \nImagine If owner Jo Johnson knew of someone who bought $500 of products from an American company, and didn't have to pay import duty. \n\"We pay wages, we play by the rules. Well, we don't have any choice, do we?\" \nThese operators don't offer the same product knowledge hobbyists need, she said. \nClarkin has run Paperzone for 20 years and said the key for small retailers to survive is maintaining a point of difference. \nShe produces her own range of craft paper, called Paper-Arts, which is sold exclusively in the store. \nMore than just retail outlets, these stores are hubs for the scrapbooking community. \nThere was an encouraging buzz of customers filling the store on its opening day. \nLinda Schwartfeger, 59, and June Bailey, 66, became friends attending the Tuesday morning scrapbooking sessions at Paperzone. \nBailey said the exclusive product range was a drawcard, and the pricing remained competitive. \nWaikato was lucky to have a scrapbooking destination such as Paperzone, Schwartfeger said. \n\"If you come to a class each week it makes you do a page … whereas your self-motivation at home might not be as strong. We all motivate each other.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:25:10.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
