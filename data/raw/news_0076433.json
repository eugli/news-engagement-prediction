Nirupam, however, did claim that Sena leaders had been \"in touch with\" Congress. \nBMC elections results \nSena won 84 seats in the February-21 election to the 227-member BMC, the country's richest civic body. BJP was close behind, winning 82 seats, while Congress was a distant third with 31 seats. \nSince 114 seats are required for reaching the simple majority mark, all eyes were on Congress. However, the party sources said it was wary of siding with \"communal\" forces, especially when it had made secularism its main plank in the Uttar Pradesh elections. \nSena had claimed that some Independent corporators were with it and have taken its tally to 89.
