(Image from company's website) St. Louis printer Universal Printing laying off 102 employees \nUniversal Printing Co. provides bindery services, according to its website. (Image from company's website) \nUpdated at 3:10 p.m. \nOne of St. Louis' oldest and largest printers, Universal Printing Co., is laying off 102 employees and closing its local production facilities following its sale to Kansas City's Henry Wurst Inc. \nUniversal's production operations will gradually move to Kansas City, Mo., over the coming months and the company will retain a small sales and service office at its existing facilities at 1234 and 1328 South Kingshighway Boulevard in St. Louis, said Universal's CEO Bob Ebel. About 16 employees, including Ebel, will staff the St. Louis sales and customer service office. \n\"It's a consolidating industry,\" Ebel said of the sale. \"This will open up more capabilities for our customers and we will also improve our cost structure.\" \nFinancial terms of the sale, announced Friday, were not disclosed. Privately held Universal Printing has $40 million in annual revenue and was founded in St. Louis in 1939. Universal provides printing, bindery and mailing services and has offices in Dallas and New York. \nUniversal disclosed the changes in a layoff notice to state officials required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN). In a letter to state officials this week, Ebel said Universal was \"going out of business,\" but Friday he characterized the changes as \"consolidating operations.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:43:46.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
