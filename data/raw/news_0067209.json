Stan & Eddie’s Smokehouse and Diner, which only opened in November , is closed. Signs reading, “Stan & Eddie’s is no longer open for business,” are posted on the doors and windows of the New Garden Road eatery. Enlarge Stan & Eddie's only opened in November and closed permanently at the end of business… more “Social media killed us,” said a man who identified himself as the restaurant's manager, but who declined to give his name. “It is what it is,” he continued. “We didn’t have the business.” He and another man were removing beer and soft drinks from the building through a back door Thursday morning. When told that would-be customers had arrived at the front door only minutes earlier and seemed surprised the business had closed, the manager said, “The food’s damn good and I’m not bragging.” He said the restaurant closed at the end of business hours on Sunday. Doug Justice and his wife, Virginia, were planning to have lunch at Stan & Eddie’s on Thursday. They didn't know the business had closed before pulling into its parking lot. The couple said they’d eaten there once before, about three weeks ago, and found the food to be good. They said the restaurant was crowded on their previous visit. “They had good barbecue beef, and you can’t find that at many places,” Doug said. He and his wife said they’d read Yelp reviews that criticized the restaurant for poor service, but said they figured those problems would be rectified once the business had been open a little longer and the employees became better acquainted with their jobs. Stan & Eddie’s was located in the former Carrabba’s at 1653 New Garden Road . The restaurant featured two hickory-wood cookers and served smoked specialties like beef brisket, pulled pork barbecue, smoked turkey, barbecue chicken, ribs and salmon. The 5,700-square-foot restaurant was capable of seating 200 customers. It offered a traditional breakfast all day along with an assortment of specialties. Business hours were 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and until 10 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Steve Huffman is a general assignment reporter for Triad Business Journal.
