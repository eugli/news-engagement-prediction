Photo When the strategy first became public this week in a report by Buzzfeed , Regency explained its use of fake news sites by saying the movie is “about a ‘fake’ cure that makes people sicker.” On Thursday, however, 20th Century Fox said, “the digital campaign was inappropriate on every level, especially given the trust we work to build every day with our consumers.” “In raising awareness for our films, we do our best to push the boundaries of traditional marketing in order to creatively express our message to consumers,” Dan Berger, a spokesman for the 20th Century Fox movie studio, said in an email statement to The New York Times. “In this case, we got it wrong.” He added, “We have reviewed our internal approval process and made appropriate changes to ensure that every part of a campaign is elevated to and vetted by management in order to avoid this type of mistake in the future.” The web addresses for the fake news sites, which previously displayed ads for the movie and cited its plot in articles, now redirect people to the film’s website. “It’s a very kind of perverse use of a genre that is really counterproductive,” said Richard Edelman, chief executive of the public relations company Edelman. “I don’t think fake news is funny in the least.

Others were reposted on partisan websites like Red State Watcher. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story One woman shared a fake article from the imaginary Houston Leader on Feb. 8, which alleged that President Trump had signed an executive order banning children from vaccines for 90 days. “At least an acknowledgment that vaccines cause harm,” the user wrote. “The only safe vaccine is the one not taken.” Another article from the same site, headlined “LEAKED: Lady Gaga Halftime Performance to Feature Muslim Tribute,” appeared to be the campaign’s most viral, with more than 65,000 shares. One user posted it on Feb. 5, the day of the Super Bowl, saying, “Clearly the N.F.L. has lost complete touch with its true fan base.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
