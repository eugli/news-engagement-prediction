So when I was on anti-depressants, it not only made me happier in general, it also resolved my premature ejaculations issues which embarrassed/stressed me. Win win right. Although the orgasms were never as intense as they used to be. So maybe not win win win. \nHey guys, I have recently been put on a low dose antidepressant for a nerve pain issue that I have during sex. However it has killed my sex drive. What's the point of treating an issue of pain during sex when these pills kill my want to have sex anyway? \nDepression and antidepressant medications interact in complex ways. Is it the depression causing the sex drive problems, or the meds? \nThere's been a huge uptick in antidepressant subscriptions in Australia over the past 10 years - 89 Australians in every 1,000 were prescribed some form of antidepressant in 2011, up from 45 in 2000. The rate appears to have doubled. Iceland is the only country that has a higher rate of the use of antidepressants. How much should we blame the meds? \nAccording to 2016 research , the meds have a big part to play, though it depends a lot on the kinds of antidepressants you are taking. \nFor example, it found the class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) were associated with higher rates of sexual dysfunction. SSRIs, like Prozac, are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants in Australia, and often a doctor's first choice for most types of depression. \nTextline: \nI'm a female and have tried several different SSRI's. All have caused me to both lose my sex drive and ability to orgasm altogether. Any sexual arousal caused pelvic floor pain. I often stop taking my medication so that I am able to enjoy sex but the depression always comes back after a few weeks. \nThe study also found antidepressants can affect your sex drive weeks before they begin to work on your depression - you may experience sexual dysfunction from the meds before they kick in and help improve your mood. \n\"We might treat your depression with having an antidepressant and then that might knock out your libido as well,\" Sydney GP Dr Brad McKay told The Hook Up . \n\"It's a bit of a two-edged sword.\" \n\"If people have a normal sex drive and go along fine and then start medication and it drops off within week, it's very likely it's the medication. \nWe're not wanting them to go along and hate the medication they're on and hate life because they've lost their whole sex life.\" \nDr McKay said men tended to report antidepressants made their penis less sensitive, and some even found that it fixed their premature ejaculation problems. \n\"They love being on antidepressants as it helps them in the bedroom,\" he said. \nTextline: \nAs someone who has borderline personality disorder, having medication that inhibits my libido has actually been somewhat of a godsend. A symptom of BPD is self-destructive behaviour, which includes unsafe sex and getting into dangerous sexual situations. Before I was properly medicated, I would have sex with people I loathed but the need to ward off the fear of abandonment led me into bad sexual situations. Nowadays I can easily quench my sexual need by having a cheeky wank and I won't seek out sex with anyone and/or everyone. \nResearch shows men generally report higher rates of problems with orgasm as a result of antidepressants than women, but that may be partly because women are more likely to have had orgasm problems before treatment. \nDr McKay said that, in his experience of practicing in Australia, antidepressants tended to affect men and women's libidos equally. \n\"I think guys notice it a little bit more - if they're used to having sex for a certain amount of time and then ejaculating.\" \n\"For women they might have a bit more variable ability and variable time to orgasm - sometimes it can take a little bit longer until they realise there's actually a problem with this and it's not how it used to be. \n\"I've had patients who say 'I've been been masturbating for four hours and I'm still not getting anywhere'.\" \nHe said that some people are too shy to tell their GP they are having problems with sex, and so they get re-prescribed the same pills. \"Some GPs will just go with the last medication you had. They ask, 'You didn't have any side effects? You go, 'No', because you are embarrassed and then you go back on the same drug. \n\"But we have about 50 different meds we can use.\" \nSo if you're on antidepressants and having problems with sex, ask your doctor about being prescribed a different kind.
