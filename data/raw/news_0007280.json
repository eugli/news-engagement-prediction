A private golf club selected as the golf venue for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics has defended its practice of excluding women as full members, saying that it allows females to play the course on Sundays. According to the Tokyo organizer, the International Olympic Committee in January demanded in writing the club change its policy on female membership. It stated that the club's membership practice violates the spirit of the IOC, as it breaches the fundamental principles of the Olympic Charter that bans any form of discrimination, including by gender. Hiroshi Imaizumi, general manager of the club, said that he has submitted a report to the Tokyo organizing committee denying any wrongdoing. The club has about 1,250 full members, who are all male.
