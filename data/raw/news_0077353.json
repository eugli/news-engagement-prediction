Like that phone, it has a 5.15-inch screen. Unlike that phone, it has 3GB of RAM, a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 2,860mAh battery. Compare that to the Mi 5's 4GB of RAM, 16-megapixel rear camera and 3,000mAh battery. \nBut the Mi 5C clearly wins on price: It'll cost 1,500 yuan, which converts to around $220, AU$280 and £175, when it launches on March 3 in China. That's a good bit lower than the 2,700 yuan ($400, AU$500, £315) the Mi 5 cost last year. \nThe Mi 5C houses Xiaomi's own Pinecone chipset, which packs an octa-core Surge S1 processor -- it remains to be seen how it'll stack up to Qualcomm's Snapdragon range.
