Evacuation orders have already been issued for some communities due to the high threat of mudslides.\nThose traveling around Los Angeles for the Friday evening commute will likely face significant travel delays due to the rain. Some roads will potentially become impassable because of flooding.\nStrong winds are bringing down trees across California which may lead to travel delays and power outages.\nWinds have been gusting to 40 mph around Los Angeles, but much stronger winds have been recorded at higher elevations. A 108 mph gust was recorded by MESONET near Grapevine, California, the highest wind gust reported so far from this storm.\nCapistrano Ave blocked by fallen tree at Country Club Dr. Use alternate routes. pic.twitter.com/0zuuSQnXYn\n— Atascadero Fire (@ATAFireL3600) February 17, 2017\nMost flights out of John Wayne Airport in Orange County have been canceled today, including all Southwest and American flights.\nDue to heavy rain and wind, there is a Traffic Management Program in effect for traffic arriving at Los Angeles International Airpot (LAX).
