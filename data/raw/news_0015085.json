The clip features audio of someone shouting at Sherstyachenko in Cantonese as he roams the rooftop, which he captions: “If you [sic] not coming down, we’ll call the cops.”\nIn the age of selfies, there’s more to happy snaps than narcissism, study shows \nThe stuntman, who began training as a gymnast at 16 , is later seen walking along the building’s narrow beams before dangling from them over the city below while he does pull-up exercises.\nThe fearless rooftopper made headlines worldwide with similar performances in Hong Kong last summer for an advert for hotel booking website Travel Ticker. He has also performed high-profile stunts on Tsing Ma Bridge, Dubai’s Princess Tower and across buildings in Moscow.\n\nNeither he nor Circulr responded to requests for comment on Sunday.\nHong Kong, home to some of the world’s tallest skyscrapers, has long been a destination of choice for members of the so-called ‘rooftopping’ community.\nLast August, Moscow-based model Angela Nikolau posed for pictures on the edge of a Central skyscraper rooftop, as well as at Tsing Ma Bridge.\nWe also cannot characterise all young people as being ambitious enough to skate on an open rooftop Joseph Wan, youth group founder Meanwhile, members of local stunt group Exthetics – Dex Ng, Daniel Lau and Lawrence Tsui – have gained notoriety for their heart-stopping videos.\nJoseph Wan, founder and president of local youth NGO Support International Foundation, said that although he thought the rooftopping trend in Hong Kong was “potentially dangerous” he did not think videos such as Sherstyachenko’s would necessarily influence young people to imitate it.\n“It’s hard to generalise about the safety of rooftopping, given that most rooftops are fenced up or have concrete barriers,” he said. “We also cannot characterise all young people as being ambitious enough to skate on an open rooftop.”\nWan declined to comment on the legality of the practice.\nDespite its controversial nature, the video was widely praised on YouTube, where it has been viewed more than 475,000 times since it was uploaded on January 28.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:33:15.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
