Mick Frewen said a pilot reported a \"catastrophic engine failure\" moments before the plane crashed into a storage area at the rear of the mall.\nPolice and paramedics rushed to the crash site, where firefighters doused the flames.\nThis video image shows the site of a plane crash near Essendon Airport in Melbourne, Australia, Tuesday.
