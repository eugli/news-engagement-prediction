He got torn apart by not one but two new records. \nThe first diss came from The Weeknd , who featured on Nav's new single, \" Some Way .\" \"I think your girl, think your girl, fell in love with me,\" he sings, before hitting Bieber with a vicious sexual taunt: \"She say my fuck and my tongue game a remedy.\" \nOf course, The Weeknd is alluding to his new girlfriend, Selena Gomez, who's had an intense, on-and-off relationship with Bieber for much of the time that each of them have been in the spotlight. \nIf The Weeknd's words weren't cruel enough, Gomez took Bieber to task hours later, via the new song \"It Ain't Me,\" a collab with Norwegian producer Kygo. The whole song seems to be about how he let her down. \nShe hits him with a few rhetorical questions on the song's chorus: \"Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning? / Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep? / Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?\" \nThe answer lies in the title. \"It ain't me,\" Gomez proudly chants. \nOuch. Two songs in one day? The new couple clearly has no respect for the ghosts of Gomez' romantic past. This might as well be a declaration of war... \nIt's time for Bieber to show us what that stomach tat is all about.
