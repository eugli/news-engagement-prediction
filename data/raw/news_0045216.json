Google Assistant: What is it? \nGoogle Assistant is Google's latest iteration of an assistant. It's considered an upgrade or an extension of Google Now -- designed to be personal -- as well as an expansion of Google's existing \"OK Google\" voice controls. \nFor anyone who has been using Android for some time, you'll know that Google's Google Now feature smartly pulls out relevant information for you. It knows where you work, and it knows your meeting locations and travel plans, the sports teams you like, and what interests you. This data is presented to you in cards and through reminders on your Android device. \nThe \"OK Google\" side covers voice commands, voice searching, and voice-activated device control, letting you do things like send messages, check appointments and so on on your Android device, just like Apple's Siri on an iPhone or iPad. Google Assistant fuses all this together with a new bot-centric AI experience, designed to give you conversational interactions that cover both these areas and more. \nHere's how Google explained its new assistant: \"The assistant is conversational -- an ongoing two-way dialogue between you and Google that understands your world and helps you get things done. It makes it easy to buy movie tickets while on the go, to find that perfect restaurant for your family to grab a quick bite before the movie starts, and then help you navigate to the theater.\" Google Assistant: Which devices are compatible? \nGoogle Assistant is now available on the Google Pixel smartphones and Google Home . A limited version can also be accessed now in the Google Allo app . It is also coming to Android Wear devices via Android Wear 2.0, and Google has confirmed it will be made available for Android TV (both televisions and set-top boxes) as well as cars, presumably through Android-powered infotainment systems or even Android Auto. Google Assistant comes to Android TV, Android Wear 2.0, and more \nAlthough Google has said that Google Assistant is exclusive to the Pixel smartphones, it has also said Google Assistant is appearing on Pixel phones first, suggesting it will be coming to other devices in the future. And since the Allo app works across almost all Android devices, as well as the iPhone, you could say that nearly all smartphones have access to Google Assistant. \nHowever, the full Google Assistant experience is deeply integrated into the Pixel devices, and it is very different to the iteration in Allo, which is limited by comparison -- as we discuss below. We expect Google to have Google Assistant on all Android, Android Wear, and Android Auto devices before too long. Google Assistant tips and tricks: Master your Android assistant Google Assistant: How does it work? \nThe thing to remember about Google Assistant is that it is designed to be conversational. That means you can ask a question and then ask several follow-up questions, and Google Assistant will be able to keep track of the conversation, determine context, and audibly respond with the right information. Here's how Google Assistant works across the different Google devices. Pocket-lint Google Pixel and Pixel XL \nWith Google Assistant baked deep into the new Pixel smartphones, it's no surprise to find that there's instant access from the home button. Where this home button would once give you Now on Tap with a long press, that's now replaced by Google Assistant. \nLong press on the home button and you enter the Google Assistant interface. This looks a lot like OK Google and can be triggered with the same hot word, with listening bars picking up your voice and instantly transcribing what you say onto the screen. You are then delivered a spoken reply, with results returned on the screen too. You can speak or tap your selections and the conversation continues. \nFor example, you can ask what you should have for dinner, and Google Assistant will locate local places to eat and serve up suggestions, with cards for a selection of restaurants. Google has further demonstrated this example by then booking a table using OpenTable. \nGoogle Assistant also takes over things like navigation. Say you want to navigate home -- as you would with OK Google -- that still works, but you can also ask to find coffee shops on the way, for example. \nThings run much deeper, though. You can ask what your next flight is, when your trip is, and you can ask to watch a particular programme on Netflix, or you can ask to view dog photos from your collection. There's also a wide range of fun options, like games, with a full panel show game hidden behind the \"I'm feeling lucky\" command. \nOur experience so far suggests that Google Assistant is going to be huge and as it stands, it's a long way ahead of Siri, Alexa or Cortana.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:10:10.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
