The sketches have been unbelievable all through the election, and the post-election. So yeah, we could have a revolving door of people playing the cabinet members and all.” \nBaranski is the latest actor to pitch an appearance on “Saturday Night Live” this season, following Melissa McCarthy’s celebrated cameo as Sean Spicer. Rosie O’Donnell has gone on record saying that she is willing to play Trump’s right-hand-man , Steve Bannon, while Trump supporter Billy Baldwin wants to join his brother Alec on the late-night sketch show as Eric Trump. \nUntil Baranski makes her way to Studio 8H, however, she’ll be resisting Trump in a different manner as Diane Lockhart every week on CBS’ “The Good Wife” spinoff, “The Good Fight.” The premiere episode, which airs on CBS All Access Feb. 19, begins with the famously pro-Hillary Clinton Diane watching Trump’s inauguration in shock. \n“She’s — what’s the British word? — gobsmacked,” Baranski said. “Robert King was very specific about how he wanted me to play it. He kept saying, ‘You’re stunned. Now go ahead, open your mouth. You’re stunned, Christine — open your mouth even wider.” This back-and-forth continued until Baranski felt she was going too far: “I thought, ‘Oh, this is too broad.’ [But] I must tell you, as I was watching many of the press conferences, I was like [that]. I think a lot of people will relate to this gobsmacked look.” Also on HuffPost 'SNL' Stars Before They Were Famous 'SNL' Stars Before They Were Famous 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T17:15:04.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
