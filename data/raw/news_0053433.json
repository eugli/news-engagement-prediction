She was closely monitored by zoo staff during her early days.\nAs was the case with Hudson and Humphrey, Juno’s stay in the Peg will be temporary, the zoo said, as she finds opportunities here to socialize and engage.\n“Having Juno come to Assiniboine Park Zoo will give her the opportunity to learn from and develop alongside other polar bears her age. This will be very beneficial to her as she continues to mature,” Lunsford said.\nUpon arrival, Juno will undergo a standard 30-day quarantine, when she’ll be introduced to cubs Nanuq and Siku. They are both living at the Leatherdale International Polar Bear Conservation Centre, and are close to Juno’s age.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:27:38.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
