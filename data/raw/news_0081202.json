Witnesses are accusing Nigerian soldiers of killing unarmed civilians, as well. Reports of civilian massacres have emerged in recent weeks as residents from areas previously sealed off by Boko Haram start to stream out. “As more combatants from Boko Haram have been hiding within the civilian population, the line between who is civilian and who is not has been blurred,” said Agnes Bjorn, a manager for Plan International, an aid group. “It is, however, the responsibility of the Nigerian Army to protect civilians and clearly distinguish between civilians and combatants. Protecting civilians in war is part of international humanitarian law.” \n  The Nigerian Army has a long record of human rights abuses . In 2013, soldiers burned homes and opened fire in the village of Baga, killing as many as 200 people, survivors said. Civilians have complained for years of arbitrary detentions , torture and killing by soldiers. Worried about such abuses, the American government held up the sale of attack helicopters to the Nigerian military. President Muhammadu Buhari , a former general elected on promises to defeat Boko Haram and stamp out corruption, pledged to clean up the abuses. \n  “We are guided by rules and guided by our transparency of operations,” said Brig. Gen. Rabe Abubakar, the director of defense information for the Nigerian military. He denied that the military was responsible for the massacres, contending that insurgents, “criminal elements” or cult members could be to blame. Many observers give the president credit for pressing the campaign against Boko Haram and taking steps toward professionalizing the military. \n  Soldiers have pushed into forests that have long hidden Boko Haram fighters. New villages have been freed, and major roads have reopened. The army says it has scattered Boko Haram and encouraged many of the nearly two million people in Nigeria who have been uprooted by violence to go back home. \nAdvertisement “What you find now is a collection of ragtags that are running from pillar to post,” Maj. Gen. Leo Irabor, the commander leading the fight against Boko Haram, said of the militants at a recent news conference. Photo Nigerian soldiers in Borno State last year.

Here in Borno State, the center of the battle against Boko Haram, one commander even secured a film projector to host a movie night in a displaced persons camp, screening “Tom and Jerry” cartoons and movies in two local languages. But allegations of abuse continue. The military has detained children and infants for weeks at a time after their families have escaped or been freed from Boko Haram territory. Huge detention centers have been set up to hold families until civilians with perceived sympathies for Boko Haram can be weeded out. Last month, the Nigerian military mistakenly bombed a displaced persons camp, killing at least 90 civilians . \n  Humanitarian workers for the United Nations said they had heard repeated complaints from civilians that the military had been evacuating villages and burning them to the ground. On a helicopter flight over the area, the blackened remains of small villages were clear. Inside one enormous camp for displaced persons, on the grounds of an old science-theme high school, several residents said the military ordered them to leave their villages to carry out operations against insurgents. Shortly after they fled, they said, their villages were set ablaze. Salamatu Omaru, an elderly woman living in the camp with her sister, said the military told everyone in her village of Uruga to clear out three weeks ago. A relative sneaked back to check on their homes, she said, only to find them burned. Like most residents with similar complaints, Ms. Omaru was uncertain whether soldiers or insurgents were responsible. But witnesses had few such doubts about the massacres last year in Marte, a dangerous region where military officials say operations against insurgents continue. \n  Residents acknowledge that Boko Haram had recruited fighters from the tiny villages in the area. Militants would also go to a market there to get fuel and meat. Last summer, soldiers killed three Boko Haram members in Marte and captured 11 others, recovering hand grenades and weapons. \nAdvertisement A few days before the massacres in June, witnesses said, soldiers and local vigilantes surrounded the village of Ngubdori, a small farming community in the area. They rounded up all residents, including those out working in the fields, witnesses said. \nAdvertisement Men were forced to remove their shirts, perhaps to reveal any weapons they might be hiding. They stood bare-chested before the soldiers, said Mallam, a 25-year-old man who complied. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
