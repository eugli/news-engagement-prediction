We know from our own data that diagnosis of autism has increased significantly over the last decade, with rising awareness of the condition. At the same time, there have been significant decreases in the number of pupils identified as having moderate learning difficulties. \n“The changes we introduced in 2014 put children with special educational needs and their families at the heart of the system, and we have given councils £223m of additional funding over four years to support these reforms. We have also provided £23m of additional revenue funding this year to help councils review their special educational needs provision, including special schools.” \nThe Local Government Association said special educational needs provision was significantly underfunded. Cllr Richard Watts, chair of the Local Government Association’s Children and Young People Board, said: “Councils are doing everything they can within the resources available to make sure children are being supported and getting the help that they need.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:09:03.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
