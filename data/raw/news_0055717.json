It also banned refugees for a period of 120 days, and refugees from Syria indefinitely. \nThe new order reportedly focuses on the same Muslim-majority countries but will only apply to citizens of those countries who do not have visas and who have never been to the U.S., according to USA Today. Green card holders and people with valid visas will not be affected.   \nThe indefinite ban on Syrian refugees has also been scrapped. \nLegal analysts indicate that Trump's opponents will have a harder time defeating the revised order in court. \n\"It definitely seems like he'd be on much stronger ground,\" University of North Carolina law professor Andrew Hessick told USA Today. \"It's very hard to say there's a due process claim for people who are outside the country.\" \nNevertheless, Trump's opponents are preparing for another battle. \n\"We do not think that religious discrimination will automatically be removed simply by tweaking the wording of the executive order,\" ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said. \"We're certainly pleased if certain groups are exempted, like legal permanent residents and existing visa holders. But that will not cure all the legal defects.\" \nTrump spoke of the new order during his press conference on Feb. 16, saying it would be \"a very bad decision\" by the federal courts. \n\"But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more,\" he said, according to The New York Times. \"But we're tailoring it now to the decision. We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:01:12.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
