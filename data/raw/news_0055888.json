SEE ALSO: Two models rescue a group of teenagers from a frozen lake \nClarke has been in a wheelchair for two years, according to The Advertiser . \n\"For somebody in a wheelchair to be able to compete is a big thing. I really hope it sends a message that no matter what your race, size or disability — whatever makes you different — you are beautiful,\" she told the newspaper. \n\"I want to be a role model and empower young women.\" A post shared by Miss World Australia (@missworldaustralia) on Feb 19, 2017 at 2:59pm PST \nUnfortunately, Clarke didn't make it to the next round of competition, with Aishah Stocker and Sophie Ludbrock named as state finalists. \nShe may have another chance, however. Entrants can also make the nationwide final with Miss World's Beauty with a Purpose campaign, which raises funds for local children's charity, Variety. \n\"I know how challenging financially it can be to be disabled and I want to help families who are burdened with that stress,\" she said. \nThe highest fundraiser will get to strut their stuff in the national final in July.
