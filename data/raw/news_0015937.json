But that’s not my call.)\nThe loop below shows precipitation arriving around sunrise Tuesday and continuing throughout most of the day. In Boston, some brief snowfall will quickly turn into rain. There will be a longer period of snow across northern and western areas, especially beyond Route 128 and even Route 495.\nRain and snow will fall across the region early Tuesday. —Tropical Tidbits As the precipitation begins tomorrow, Boston itself could see a coating to a slushy inch of snow, but that would be about it. While I am not expecting much snow, northern Worcester County could receive a few inches.\nA look at precipitation totals for Tuesday. —Dave Epstein I am not expecting a lot of rain, just about half an inch or so of moisture, which includes any melted snow and ice. Expect puddles and delays on the roads. Folks who want to come to the parade tomorrow should allow themselves extra time to get into the city for both traffic and weather reasons.\nTemperatures will only be in the mid-30s during the parade on Tuesday. —Dave Epstein Another weather system headed our way on Thursday could bring several inches of snow to southern New England. It could be several inches, but there’s a chance it all stays out to sea as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:59:24.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
