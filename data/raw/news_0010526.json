RSL sub-branches angry \nIn a letter seen by the ABC, Rooty Hill sub-branch president Sean Plunkett stated membership applications have been declining in recent months, and that people at the top of the league have lost sight of its \"ideals and aims\". \nMascot RSL sub-branch president Paul Graham told the ABC he is appalled. \n\"The league's money is for the men lying on the bloody streets — that's how angry I am at this,\" he said. \n\"I raise money every year from selling poppies to raising BBQs, and I look at these guys and it disgusts me\". \nIt is not the first time the league has been criticised for its legal bills. \nMr Harrigan was the subject of a discrimination complaint in 2010, although he later apologised and the matter was settled in conciliation. \nIt has also been revealed that a sixth state councillor, Bill Humphrey, has now stood down. \nState council asked Mr Humphrey to stand down last year, pending the outcome of an investigation into his receipt of consultancy fees from another arm of the RSL. \nAll the men being investigated deny any wrongdoing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:20:03.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
