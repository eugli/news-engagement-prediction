Issa Hayatou \nIn a release signed by nine Nigerians holding different offices in CAF: General Dominic Oneya, Dr Amos Adamu, Amanze Uchegbulam, Sani Lulu Abdullahi, Aminu Maigari, Dr Bolaji Ojo-Oba, Paul Bassey, Aisha Falode and Barrister Chris Green, they protested that no Nigerian member of CAF has been consulted nor informed out of courtesy about the ambitions of the NFF President. \n‘’We do not remember Mr Ahmad visiting Nigeria to solicit or canvass for votes nor do we have any record of Mr Ahmad’s pedigree in the running of football in Africa that would have led Mr Pinnick to dangerously throw all of Nigeria’s eggs in his basket. We stand dangerously threatened. \nThe same cannot be said of CAF President Issa Hayatou, FIFA Senior Vice President, who overtime has been a pillar of support and true friend of Nigerian football and whose service to the round leather game cannot be disputed given the giant strides that football in the continent has taken especially in the areas of sponsorship and partnership, and the spread of the game to all nooks and corners of the continent.
