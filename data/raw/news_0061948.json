I lost my head a bit and tried to take him out thinking 'Who's this young player coming in and nutmegging me?' \n\"I chased him round for a few minutes but I didn't want to get nutmegged again so just stayed up front! \" \nHe probably did well to stay up-front, because it's there that Alli has managed to pick out Kane time and time again for goal after goal. \nAfter his introduction, Alli went on to claim the PFA Young Player of the Year award after his stunning first campaign in the top-flight, as well as a place at Euro 2016 with England. \nWhat do you think of Kane's story? And just how good a player is Alli? \nThis story was first featured on talkingbaws.com - simple, shareable sport. Like them on Facebook and follow them on Twitter.
