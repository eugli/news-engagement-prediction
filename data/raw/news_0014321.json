(Andrew Kurjata/CBC)\nThe second to start up is the Wolverine mine, which is much closer to Tumbler Ridge than Brûlé.\nIt comes with its own rail facility for direct shipment out of the community.\nThat can't be done, however, without $23 million worth of repairs to the CN Rail lines leading out of the community. \nUnclear if or when repairs will happen CN spokeswoman Kate Fenske confirms the line went out of service because there were no rail movements on it.\n\"Significant investments are needed to resume rail service to any potential new customer,\" she wrote in an email.\nFor [CN] to make a decision that affects a community I think is a little above what a private company should do. - Tumbler Ridge mayor Don McPherson \"We can acknowledge active discussion with local officials and potential customer but decline to give specifics.\"\nMcPherson said in his talks with CN it seems there isn't much interest in getting the line up and running in the immediate future.\nIn the short-term, coal can be shipped by truck but the single-lane road out of town can't maintain that sort of traffic for long.\nMcPherson also said there are other possible mine restarts that won't happen unless the rail line is operational.\nHe feels as if Tumbler Ridge is being \"held hostage\" by CN.\n\"That's the lifeblood of this town.
