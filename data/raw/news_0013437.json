They know that until now we haven’t won a title. It is important to recognise this and keep the antennae very high. Watch | Chelsea v Arsenal - key match stats 01:02 \n“In my career in football I won a lot but I lost a lot. I lost three Champions League finals [1997, 1998, 2003] and I won only one [1996]. \n“I still have that hunger. I won a title with four games left to play. Another time I lost one in the same way. \n“I have a lot of experience to manage this season and to keep the antennae high.” \nH e praised Hazard’s brilliant second-half goal, but also his ­defensive discipline, and his “concentration and ­determination”. Arsenals Saturday lunchtime horror shows \nW enger said: “One of the peculiarities of the game today is that referees are much more severe with tackles on the ground and let much more go with elbows in the face. It’s not only today, but in many, many games I see that. But it’s more dangerous to hit the head than the legs.” \nWenger said that Bellerín had to come off on the advice of the medical team. He was struck a second before Chelsea’s goal and was unable to give the correct scoreline when he was tested during treatment on the pitch.

Excuse me, I cannot be told that in England it is a foul. Alonso jumped more than Bellerín and scored a goal. To hear this [that it was a foul] in England – I’m surprised. In ­Italy? Maybe [it would be disallowed].” The substitute Cesc Fabregas added a third before Olivier Giroud, a substitute for Arsenal, got one for his side in time added on at the end. Chelsea vs Arsenal: Player ratings \n“Certainly individually we were not at our best in some positions,” Wenger said. “It’s very difficult to speak about that straight after the game.” \nO n Chelsea he said: “They look at the moment in full confidence, powerful, strong. They don’t concede goals. It’s for them to lose it. They are in the best position, they don’t play in Europe. They can wait every week for the next game, prepare properly. They are in a very, very strong position. \n“Where does that leave us? To focus and prepare to win the next game. That’s what football is about.” Follow Telegraph Football", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:26:08.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
