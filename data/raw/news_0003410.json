However it also shows the depth of Gorscuch’s right-wing credentials – and his penchant for mischief while attending his exclusive prep school in the 1980s.\nBut as it turns out the story was exaggerated. It comes from a joke that he wrote in the high school yearbook to mock his liberal schoolmates who would insult him during debates, as related in American Magazine. \nHe wrote that he founded and led the “Fascism Forever Club,” though those with knowledge of the school back in the 1980s say there was no such club. The mention of it in the yearbook was a tongue-in-cheek attempt to poke fun at liberal peers who teased him about his fierce conservatism.\nIt was “a total joke,” said Steve Ochs, a history teacher at Georgetown Prep who was the student government advisor during Mr. Gorsuch’s junior and senior years at the Bethesda, Md., school.\nBut a lie gets around the world long before the truth can get its boots on, as the old saying goes. The story has gone viral among those only too eager to call anyone associated with the Trump administration a “fascist.”\nTrump threatens #UCBerkley federal funding over free speech, just as he suggests a \"Fascist Forever\" for #SCOTUS . #UCBerkleyRiot #gorsuch \n— Girls Really Rule.

CNN’s political director David Chalian said that Democrats will likely confirm Gorsuch without the Republicans resorting to the “nuclear option.” Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has vowed that Democrats will not be successful in attempting to filibuster Gorsuch, a move some Democrats have promised to do regardless of the nominee. \nConservatives especially praise him for being an admirer of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose seat he will take if confirmed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T06:15:39.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
