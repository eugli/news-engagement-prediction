Today: Hacksaw Ridge Teresa Palmer and Andrew Garflield in a scene from Hacksaw Ridge. ( Mark Rogers ) By Peter Howell Movie Critic Tues., Feb. 21, 2017 We’re handicapping the odds on the nine Best Picture contenders for the Feb. 26 Academy Awards. Today: Hacksaw Ridge. Quick pitch: The Second World War rages on, and pacifist U.S. army medic Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) is willing to do what he can to help win it and save lives – but only if he doesn’t have to pick up a gun. Starring: Andrew Garfield, Teresa Palmer, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Directed by: Mel Gibson Key early kudos: BAFTA Best Editing, AACTA Best Director Box office (domestic, U.S. dollars): $66.8 million. Ladbrokes odds: 100/1 Paddy Power: 66/1 Sky Bet: 66/1 Why it could win: It’s a rousing drama set in the past, which Oscar loves, and it has accompanying nominations for actor (Garfield), director and editing, often a portent for Best Picture glory. Why it might not: A war movie in the bellicose time of Trump goes against the popular mood, and likely also the liberal instincts of the Academy. Howell’s line: Academy redemption for Mel Gibson and respect for Hacksaw Ridge , but no Best Picture gold for either.
