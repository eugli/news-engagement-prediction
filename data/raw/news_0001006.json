I guess that there's not a lot of humour at the moment.'\nThe photo remained on Ms Kerr's Facebook page up until news of the photo broke on Friday, when it was taken down.\nA statement from the Prime Minister's Office confirmed Ms Kerr had been suspended\nThe news is another blow for Mr Turnbull, who went into crisis control on Thursday after details of his first official phone call with US President Trump were revealed.\nThe conversation centred on a deal signed off by Barack Obama to take 1,250 asylum seekers from Manus and Nauru - which President Trump is outspokenly against.\nThe Washington Post, citing anonymous US officials, said President Trump accused Mr Turnbull of trying to send the 'next Boston bombers' to the United States in the heated phone call, before abruptly ending the scheduled one-hour chat in just 25 minutes.\nThen on Thursday, the President took to Twitter to slam the Obama administration for agreeing to take on the refugees in the first place.\n'Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!,' he wrote.\nThe news is another blow for Mr Turnbull, who went into crisis control on Thursday after details of his first official phone call with US President Trump were revealed", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-03T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:37:00.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
