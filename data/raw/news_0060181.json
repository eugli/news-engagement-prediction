He was said to have sufficiently acquitted himself in that office and may have partly recommended him for a place in the Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu cabinet in 1999. \nHis stewardship for the eight years he served as Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice is well referenced in the reforms he introduced into the Lagos judiciary which have been copiously copied by the federal judiciary. \nAmong the reforms was the introduction of the frontloading of witnesses and processes which helped to quicken judicial proceeding. He also reactivated or enhanced the Alternative Dispute Resolution, ADR option for settling cases. \nBut by far the most conspicuous evidence of Osinbajo’s reforms was the enhancement of the welfare of judicial officers, a system that was well copied by the federal judiciary. The enhancement of the welfare of the judicial officers was to minimise the temptation for judicial officers. \nHowever, some allege that once the welfare of judges was enhanced, that the Lagos State Government never lost cases at the Lagos High Courts! It was as such the practice that those desperate in their cases against the Lagos State Government had to resort to the Federal High Courts and where not, would take the route of joining federal bodies like the Attorney General of the Federation to provide the locus. \nBut Osinbajo’s focus on administrative reforms did not mean that he abandoned his duties as attorney general as he took time leading the state’s legal team in several important cases especially constitutionally related matters. \nFor a man who understudied the Lagos political navigator, that is Tinubu for eight years the fact that he did not turn into a super political tactician in his own right was surprising. He, in fact, belongs to the fraction of appointees who served eight straight years, a fact ably helped by his apparent zero tolerance for oozing lucre. \nAt the end of his eight-year political stint, Osinbajo went back to his legal practise shocking those who thought he should have translated his very impressive success in office into political gain. \nWell, that was to those who did not know the superior call of God upon him. After leaving office, he upped his ministry at the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG rising to become a provincial pastor. \nSince his return to the political space in 2015, Osinbajo had been largely under cover, understandably so in a presidential system where the president and governors wield power maximally with scant regard for their deputies. \nHowever, in the Muhammadu Buhari–Osinbajo relationship, many would have also seen the effectual hand of the vice-president in the packaging and promulgation of policies. He is especially known to have been actively involved in the social welfare scheme of the administration. \nFor such policy wonks, their actions are often credited to their political principals, especially where such principals are of the charismatic hue. For all that Osinbajo he did in Lagos State, the reforms are still credited to Tinubu. Likewise, his contributions to the present federal administration would be credited to President Buhari. \nWith Buhari presently on leave, Osinbajo, has, however, been exposed! Last week and again on Monday, attempts to fly to Akure in continuation of his visits to the Niger Delta states were unsuccessful. Penultimate Friday, bad weather at Akure Airport stopped his presidential jet from landing, and he had to make a return to Abuja. \nAgain last Monday, bad weather still stopped the acting president from even venturing towards Akure. The visit would also have been an opportunity for the acting president to commission some projects undertaken by former Governor Segun Mimiko who left office yesterday. \nHowever, the inability of the acting president to visit Akure during Mimiko’s watch has been laced with political interpretations. Few, if any insightful political observer, would forget how the once cordial relationship between Mimiko and Osinbajo’s political leader, Tinubu moved into stormy weather after the former governor came to office in 2012. \nSo when it was claimed that weather twice stopped Osinbajo from meeting Mimiko the inclination of some to read political meanings into it would not have been difficult. While few would doubt the narrative of bad weather as given by Osinbajo’s media aide, Pastor Laolu Akande, the coincidence was just poignant enough to put the first suspicion of intrigue around the Acting President! \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T10:23:05.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
