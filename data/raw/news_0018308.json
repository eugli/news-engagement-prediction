Article continues below \nBut there is one fan that copped some serious flak on Saturday afternoon for making his feelings known. \nAnd he didn't get it in the ear for voicing his protestations, he got it because he brought a banner to the game with the words 'Enough is enough, time to go' emblazoned on the front. Article continues below \nSky Sports pundit Gary Neville isn't one for mincing his words, and when he spotted the fan, he questioned the logic of bringing the banner in as though he was anticipating a defeat. \n\"He’s a an idiot that guy,\" Neville said (via the Mirror ). \n\"What would he have done if Arsenal had won? Hidden it inside his jacket all game and the way home? \n\"Arsene Wenger doesn’t deserve that, obviously the Arsenal fans are disappointed, but to pre-empt by bring a banner into the ground, it’s a joke. \n\"Remember, the consistency of finishing in the top four might not be acceptable for Arsenal fans, but the alternative might be that you finish below those positions. \n\"Think about changing your manager, it might be that you don’t finish in the top four for a few seasons, and actually what Arsene Wenger has achieved is fantastic. So, be careful.\" \nHe raises a good point, but it says a lot about the state of the club's support if their fans are now taking banners to the ground in preparation for losing. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
