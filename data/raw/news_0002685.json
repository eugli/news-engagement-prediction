You have all made a huge difference to the lives of thousands of women, men and children, in our great nation.” \n“However, I have never been willing to politicize this agenda. As a consequence I feel it necessary to cancel the First Lady’s Half Marathon this year.” \nThe First Lady however says she is committed to and will not deviate from her ultimate goal, which is the betterment of maternal healthcare in the country, and, to build the Beyond Zero Referral Hospital.
