According to Washington Post estimates based on an an October 2016 Government Accountability Office analysis of White House travel , the president's three trips have probably cost the federal Treasury about $10 million.

In total, the travel bill during Obama's presidency came to $97 million and incredibly, Donald Trump is on course to outspend him in less than one year. The Washington Post reported that \"the elaborate lifestyle of America’s first family is straining the Secret Service and security officials, stirring financial and logistical concerns in several local communities, and costing far beyond what has been typical f or previous presidents .\" Before Trump became president, he frequently lambasted Obama's travel expenses on Fox News and Twitter.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2011 When Trump sat down for his first formal interview after his election victory (on CBS's 60 Minutes), the president-elect said, \"I don't think we'll be very big on vacations, no.\" However, after a chaotic and stressful start to life in the White House, he might have changed his mind.
