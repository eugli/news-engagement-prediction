The accident was captured on Mr Fritz's Nest camera on Tuesday, February 21. Mr Fritz (pictured with Nyx) rescued the moggy almost four years ago and said she has been a 'walking disaster' Mr Fritz's wife Gabrielle said: 'I cried from laughing so hard the first time I saw it. 'Poor David had been working on his taxes so he wasn't too happy at first but now he can see the funny side of it. 'Ever since we rescued her almost four years ago, Nyx has been a walking disaster but fortunately she didn't injure herself. 'We mostly bought the Nest camera so we could spy on the cats while at work. 'Nyx will play with anything moving and get right on top of you when you are trying to use the computer. 'She will snake in between your feet while walking and grabs your toes under the blankets. 'David is used to her antics as he gets to work from home a lot and has to deal with her most days.'
