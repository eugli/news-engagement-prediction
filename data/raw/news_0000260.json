With last week in the books, now Inside the Gators brings its weekly 3-2-1 report, as we provide three observations, present two questions and make one prediction as the Gators head into home match-ups with Missouri and No. 8 Kentucky.\nFlorida freshman guard Eric Hester (2) USA Today Sports Images Three things we learned last week:\n1. Florida's back-to-back routs of LSU and Oklahoma made for a week that was for the history books.\nNot only was it Florida's first consecutive 30-point wins since the 2012-13 season, but it made for its first back-to-back 30-point road wins in school history and the first time the Gators have ever routed major conference opponents by 30-plus points in back-to-back contests. UF entered the 2016-17 season with seven previous road wins of 30-plus points, and now it has three on the season (at UNF, LSU and Oklahoma), the most ever in a single season in program history.\nRegardless, Florida moved up just one spot in the AP Top 25 this week, from No. 25 to No. 24, despite defeating both of its opponents by a combined 67 points. Voters probably took into account that the Tigers and Sooners, who have combined for a 17-23 record this season, aren't very good, but the Gators were certainly impressive this past week.\n2. After both were areas where the Gators struggled against South Carolina and Vanderbilt, Florida's three-point shooting and defense at the start of the second half were much improved this past week.\nAgainst South Carolina and Vanderbilt, Florida went just 8-of-42 (19.0%) on threes, notably failing to knock down a single three-pointer against the Gamecocks - the first time the Gators have done that in a game since 1992. However, Florida bounced back in a big way this week, combining for 27-of-54 (50%) three-point shooting while LSU and Oklahoma went a combined 3-of-33 (9.1%) from downtown.\nAgainst the Tigers, Florida went 19-of-33 (57.6%) from behind the arc, breaking a school record for most three-pointers in a single game.\nMeanwhile, Florida's defense at the start of both second halves against LSU and Oklahoma was improved. It was an area Mike White cited as a concern heading into the week, as he noted: \"Defensively, against the 12 highest rated opponents that we’ve played, the first four minutes of second halves, we’re giving up 76 percent from the field, 76 percent. And a defensive rebounding percentage of 60 percent. And offensively, we have five assists to 12 turnovers. So, it’s all of the above to start second halves.\"\nThis week, the Gators outscored the Tigers and Sooners 18-13 during the first four minutes of the second half while holding both teams to a combined 5-of-12 shooting. On offense, Florida logged six assists against just one turnover during that span.\n3. Freshman guard Eric Hester proved he could be a legitimate scoring threat coming off the bench for the Gators this season.\nBefore last Wednesday, Hester, a Rivals150 talent from the 2016 class, did not appear in nine games this season and averaged just five minutes per contest in Florida's other 10 contests. However, Hester finally saw extended minutes in SEC action against LSU with Canyon Barry sidelined with an ankle injury.\nHester took advantage of the opportunity, scoring 16 points on 5-of-5 three-point shooting in 17 minutes on the floor. The freshman guard followed up with just two points in 14 minutes at Oklahoma, but his performance against the Tigers showed us what he is capable of. Another scoring threat coming off the bench could make the Gators even more dangerous come March.\n* GET TWO MONTHS FOR FREE\n* Was visit to 'dream school' enough to flip Rivals100 Rambo?\n* Florida visit rated a nine\n* Florida flips Stiner from Houston\n* Florida visit impacts Rivals250 safety Edwards\n* Rivals100 Ray enjoyed Florida visit, three await decision\n* Analysis: Gators reach into NOLA for Rivals250 Stewart\n-", "external_links": ["https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/zlach9ipo69lbm22xngl", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/zlach9ipo69lbm22xngl)"], "published": "2017-01-30T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T17:49:36.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
