The Dubai-based Lebanese singer-songwriter who is working on his debut solo album, went through a gamut of genres before finding his true calling in music. Coming from a high decibel, rock-metal background, it was perhaps, a major shift for Hadi who had to tone down his music and volume levels to create an ambient feel. The change in style resulted in a colourful blend of soulful melodies and reflective lyrics. The demand for independent music is on the rise and Hadi's live shows are now attracting more and more music lovers. He also has a large number of online followers - more than 1,500 subscribers, and over a quarter million views on his YouTube channel. You could call Hadi a one-man industry. He records, produces, mixes, masters, shoots videos and edits all his work at his studio where he is currently working on his solo effort. The debut album, he tells us, is inspired by the likes of Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Imagine Dragons and Adele. His covers have been shared by international bands such as In Flames, Dark Tranquillity and Katatonia to name a few. We speak to Hadi to know more about his music. How did it all start for you? It was around 2002 when I picked up an acoustic guitar. I was instantly hooked. Soon I found I was dedicating myself to something that was truly me. It felt like I was in a world of limitless possibilities. From progressive, metal rock to ambient indie-pop. Briefly explain your journey? I grew up listening to everything - from progressive music to radio hits. I find magic in both forms of music. There's a beautiful intellect that goes into progressive music, a strange and inspiring level of detail which allowed me to be articulate. It helped me widen my vocabulary on the guitar. While my solo indie-pop and ambient work draws inspiration from simplicity, minimalism, and the ability to connect with music on a very pure level. So what inspired you? It was the extraordinary talents of my favourite artists, their music impacted me in my day-to-day life. I fondly remember the day I went to buy my first guitar. I was absolutely moved by the idea that an instrument would be guiding me and helping me express myself.Moreover, I would have something to dedicate myself to. I was never lazy when it came to music. I never procrastinated, and it wasn't something that was forced upon me. Music brought out a side of me that's true and real. I still feel the same. Whenever I pick up the guitar at home or at a gig, it feels like a flame burning in my solar plexus. Which musicians have had a deep influence on you? There's an array of them. But if I have to narrow down the list to a couple of names, then I would say it's John Petrucci (of Dream Theater) and James Hetfield (of Metallica); even though their music is significantly different to mine. I have learnt so much about dedication, patience, and love of music from them. What inspires you in your song-writing process? I am heavily inspired by other music, mostly when I watch live performances (live or online). I always draw inspiration from experiences - my own and others, even movies or TV shows. The lyrics to most of my songs tell a story about personal experiences. What's on your playlist now? I'm listening to Foy Vance, Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Adele, John Mayer, Walk off The Earth, Keane, Daniela Andrade, and Julien Baker. Define music. Music is a labour of love. It is the labour of connecting to one's inner self and things around. To me, it feels like a reclusive form of expression when creating music, but then, it becomes an extroverted experience as you put your music out to the people. How would you best describe your style? I would like to label it ambient, indie-pop, with reflective lyrics. I enjoy minimalism and open spaces in music with layers of ambient sounds, shimmering guitars, and dark, deep vocals. Your music has a niche audience, what has been the response in the UAE so far? Oh, it's been great! I've met a whole lot of new people while playing shows and when connecting to them via social media. I put my heart and soul into my music, and performances, so it means a lot to me to connect with people and get back the energy from them. Who do you want your music to reach out to - teens, millennials or mature listeners?Everyone. My dream and aspiration is to share my music with people across the world from different age groups and backgrounds. I've had teens, millennials and people of different ages at my shows and continue to receive comments, likes, and shares for my videos. That's one of the coolest things with music - the ability to reach into people's hearts and lives without a specific target in mind. What's a typical gig for you? What can people expect at your concert? There's a whole lot of storytelling and ambient sounds. Playing shows is an opportunity for me to tell the stories behind the songs, to talk to people about my experiences, and to share moments with them and get their reactions.I play solo and with a band as well. My live line-up includes Josh Saldanha and Alan Short on the drums and bass respectively. My solo shows are more intimate and stripped down type of a set-up. A full band works better for bigger and louder gigs. Given a chance, name a musician you'd love to jam with. Foy Vance. He seems like a chilled out dude and I enjoy his folky/ambient vibes. Is music enough to sustain you or do you need to do something else for a living? I believe that when you set out to do something that you love, you can always find ways to make it work for you. I am blessed to be living in a place like the UAE where there are many outlets and events taking place, there's a huge art and culture movement happening here and I am happy to be a part of the wave of artists (musicians and more) that are making their way to the top with their work. How do you tackle covers? Do you maintain the originality or do you strip them down and redo them entirely? The covers I choose are usually songs that I like to hear, but in a different light. But at the same time, when working on them, it takes me on a different tangent - creatively.I've done covers that were almost completely rearranged, and some others that have been closer to the originals. I would say that one of my favourites that was very different than the original would be Linkin Park's Until It's Gone, and my favourite that was close to the original would be Hozier's track Cherry Wine. How do copyright laws work on cover tunes? With regards to copyrights, I've got a couple of the covers up for sale. It goes through a music distributor who arranges for the copyrights and all the legalities that go with it. The other tracks are up on YouTube only as videos and I haven't had any copyright issues with them. Although at this point, since I've started writing and cutting muy won songs, I am now geared more towards putting up original songs rather than covers. Have you thought of taking your music to a bigger stage - Europe or Americas? That's all I think of and plan to do. That's where I would ideally like to see myself headed. I want to share my music with people across the world - in Europe, the Americas, Asia and Australia. What's next for you? I am currently working on my solo album and while the work is in progress, I am releasing Live Session - versions of my original music. I've already put up the songs Hymn to the Earth, Breathe, and Rain on my Facebook page, and I've got another song coming up this month. Keep an eye out for that! Besides that, it's all about playing as many shows as humanly possible, and meeting new people and making new friends! How can Dubai hit high notes: Can Dubai ever become a major concert venue - like Central Park in New York City ? Definitely, I think Dubai is one of the major hubs for concerts in the region, and globally. We have had a who's who of artists come to town and it's continuing to grow. There's a limitlessness and a go-getter attitude prevailing here and I definitely see mega music festivals taking place soon. Is enough being done to promote local talent here? There's no doubt, local talent are being provided adequate support in Dubai. There are many music movements such as The Sound Garden, Freshly Ground Sounds, Go Play The World, and more that provide ample opportunities for up-and-coming artists to get on stage and perform. The Red Bull Music Academy too provides massive opportunities for artists to open for big acts that visit the UAE, and they constantly promote the culture of creativity amongst artists. However, the main thing is what the talents themselves do. I believe that all the tools are there, all the outlets are here, and the support exists, and with that it is up to artists to make waves, get out and spread the word about themselves through live shows, social media, and other channels. What's your advice to budding singers-songwriters? If you've found yourself in music, or in any art form, and it is where you feel that you are at your most authentic self then your art deserves to be put out there for people to hear it and see it. We are constantly influenced by everything around us, your work might start a ripple in someone's life which may inspire them in ways beyond what you can imagine. And that is the most satisfying emotion in the world, when you connect with people and share these truly profound experiences through art and music. There's a lot of fear that goes into making music and art, a lot of thoughts of conformity and trying to fit in. My advice is to follow your heart, do what you feel is right, and keep doing it even when you are second-guessing yourself. Five of the top UAE singer-songwriters There's a lot of talented acts in the UAE and it's going to be tough to narrow it down to just five names, but I'll mention the bands/artists most relevant to the type of music that I do.1.
