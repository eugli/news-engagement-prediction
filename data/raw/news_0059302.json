Reduce your risks by checking the air quality on a site like https://www.airnow.gov/ and moving your workout or other activities indoors when it’s poor. Whenever you can, try to choose running and cycling routes away from traffic and close to trees or bodies of water, which help soak up harmful particles and gases. 3/10 Getty Images Heartbreaker #3: You’re clueless—or silent—about your family history. \nThere’s no single gene linked to heart troubles. But a blend of genetically predetermined risk factors and shared environment (for instance, similar diets and exposure to secondhand smoke if your parents lit up) means cardiovascular conditions sometimes cluster in families, says Richard Wright, M.D., cardiologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif. \nIf a first-degree relative—that’s a parent, sibling, or child—had heart disease at a young age (younger than 55 for men, 65 for women), that doubles or triples your risk, Dr. Wright says. Your grandparents’ fate may also matter. So, ask around about health problems at your next holiday dinner or reunion. \nRelated: Can You Inherit Cancer? \nThen, share what you learn. If your father had bypass surgery at age 52, tell your doctor at your next visit. You might need extra testing for risk factors like high cholesterol or to keep on higher alert for heart-related symptoms, Dr. Wright says. 4/10 Getty Images Heartbreaker #4: You skimp on sleep. \nEven though you feel awake after your triple-shot Americano, you still can’t get by on four or five hours of sleep. Over time, chronic sleep deprivation increases your adrenaline and stress hormones, jacking up your heart rate and blood pressure and overloading your heart, says cardiologist Justin Trivax, M.D., medical director of the Cardiovascular Performance Clinic at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich. \nIn one study , Japanese men who regularly logged less than five hours of sleep had two to three times the risk of having a heart attack as those who got six to eight hours of rest. \nRelated: Here Is the Exact Amount Of Sleep You Need For Healthy Sperm \nPlan your days and nights to aim for seven to eight hours of sleep most of the time, Dr. Trivax recommends. And when that’s not possible, nap away, he suggests— preliminary research presented at a recent European Society of Cardiology conference found mid-day naps reduced blood pressure by 4 percent and prevented damage to the arteries and heart. 5/10 Getty Images Heartbreaker #5: You don’t know your numbers. \nKnowing a few key numbers, such as your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose level can go a long way in protecting your heart health. \n“It doesn’t have to be every three months or even every year, but people should be in tune with their risk of underlying risk of heart disease so it doesn’t sneak up on them and end in tragedy or bypass surgery,” says cardiologist and researcher Matthew J. Budoff, M.D., of the David Geffen School of Medicine and Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, Calif. \nOne other number to check: your coronary artery calcium score, which your doctor determines with a CT scan of your heart. Even found even a small amount of calcium or plaque buildup on the arteries before can increase your risk of heart attack: In fact, people ages 32 to 46 with any discernible buildup were 5 times as likely to have a heart attack within 12 years than those with clear scans, a study in JAMA Cardiology found. \nMany cardiologists, including Dr. Budoff and Dr. Trivax, recommend a coronary calcium scan for men age 40 and older or with multiple risk factors for heart disease. 6/10 Getty Images Heartbreaker #6: You exercise too much… \nThough both regular heart-pumping cardio and muscle-building strength training are critical for proper cardiovascular function, it’s possible to take things too far, says Dr. Trivax. Take weightlifting. Straining and using the Valsalva maneuver to hoist the heaviest load possible can create extreme spikes in blood pressure that, in people with an underlying weakness, can trigger a deadly aortic dissection , he says. \nRelated: The 5 Fastest Ways Men Die \nAnd endurance athletes aren’t off the hook, he says. Though the data aren’t definitive, some studies suggest a link between an extremely high volume of cardio—think Ironman or ultra marathon training—and a harmful thickening of the heart muscle. \nSo discuss your risk factors with your doc before you start training for extreme sports. 7/10 Getty Images Heartbreaker #7: …Or, your butt rarely leaves your office chair. \nRegardless of your workout habits, hours spent glued to your seat also pose a cardiovascular danger, Dr. Trivax says. Researchers are still working to understand why, but think it might be due to decreases in blood flow and reduced efficiency in turning blood sugar into energy. \nAccording to a recent research review in the Annals of Internal Medicine , the average adult spends more than half his waking hours taking a load off . And lingering longer in the recliner was linked to a greater risk of developing or dying from heart disease—even in people who exercised for an hour a day. \nWhat’s more, a recent report by Danish researchers suggests merely standing up isn’t always enough . Young, fit people might need a stronger stimulus—say, a flight or two of stairs or a few lunges—every hour or so to undo the damage. Set phone alarms or use an app like Move to remind you. 8/10 Getty Images Heartbreaker #8: You’re taking certain supplements. \nJust because something’s over-the-counter—or marked all-natural—doesn’t make it safe. Some of the performance-enhancing or energy-boosting products in your medicine cabinet could have harmful consequences. \nOne reason? They may contain banned substances, like steroids, hormones, or even prescription drugs that may pose a risk to your heart health. And scary thing is, many supplements—most marketed to boost weight loss, sports performance, or sexual health— remained available months after they were officially pulled from the shelves for heart-attack risk or other safety concerns. \nYour safest bet? Talk with a health care provider, such as a pharmacist, about all the stuff you’re taking. \nThat goes double if you already have a heart condition, risk factors like cholesterol, or take any heart-related medications. For instance, St. John’s Wort —commonly used to battle fatigue and sexual dysfunction—interferes with many cardiologist-prescribed drugs, Dr. Trivax says.
