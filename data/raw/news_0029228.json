He has been in a multiple-year relationship that included a break, so the “heart of the story” was very close to him. \n“In today’s culture, there’s so many different ways to find someone that you’re trying to love. The thing about this story is that it goes into the dynamics after finding each other,” Lancaster tells PEOPLE. \nThe lyric video features band members sharing their initial reaction to the track—”It almost made me tear up!”—and how special it is to share the song with fans. The band says fans have used the song for their first wedding dance, allowing them to be part of the couple’s history. Lancaster particularly recalls a military wife, whose husband is deployed, saying the track reminds her of her own great love story. \n“It was cool to hear everyone’s perspective on love because those aren’t things that guys generally sit around and talk about,” Lancaster confesses about filming the lyric video, in which he shares, “You and I personally have something in common if you can relate to this song.” \nHe continues, “I think being a songwriter means you’re always on your toes. Country music is so good at telling people’s stories .” Jeremy Cowart \nOver the past year, with major festival stops including Lollapalooza and SXSW, Lancaster says the change in their energetic live sets has been marked. \n“The biggest difference over the past year is we’re not just singing to people. We’re singing with people.” \nAnd does romantic Lancaster have special Valentine’s Day plans? \n“Just the fact that my girlfriend and I get to spend time together, that’s the biggest gift you can give to someone you’re in a relationship with,” he says.
