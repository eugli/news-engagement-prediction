Some were just plain unlucky. Some are at a career crossroads and in need of a reinvention. \nNo matter what led them to it, all 11 of these players had bad (by their standards) 2016 seasons. \nBut their 2017 seasons won't follow in those footsteps. \nHere's who you can expect to bounce back in 2017, and most importantly, why you can expect it: Patrick Gorski Patrick Gorski-USA TODAY Sports 11 Buster Posey - C - Giants \nPosey had a no-good, very bad second half of last season, but don't expect that to continue into 2017. \nPart of Posey's problems were nagging injuries — it's tough being a catcher — but a big chunk of it was terrible luck. \nPosey's power might have been zapped, but he still had an expected batting average on balls in play (xBABIP) of .335, thanks to a 21 percent line-drive rate and hitting 36 percent of batted balls hard. \nPosey's actual BABIP was .303. \nWith a clean bill of health and some better luck, expect Posey to be one of the best players in the National League in 2017. Jake Roth Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports 10 Sonny Gray - SP - A's \nHe was one of the best pitchers in the American League, but he had an injury ravaged 2016. \nThe benefit is that none of the injuries were serious — they only robbed him of a solid stat line. \nSimply put, Gray's fastball had no life last year — you can blame the injuries — and fully healthy, you should expect it to return and Gray to return to All-Star contention. John Hefti John Hefti-USA TODAY Sports 9 Joe Mauer - 1B - Twins \nMauer isn't going to compete for the MVP award anymore — he doesn't have a lick of power — but that doesn't mean that he's some scrub. \nMauer can still hit anything a pitcher throws his way, and his batted ball ratios hold up over time — he still makes solid contact and he literally didn't pop the ball up once last year. \nMauer's expected BABIP from last year was .350 — his actual BABIP was .301. You can see the discrepancy. Even a splitting of the difference could return Mauer to his 2014 form. Brad Rempel Brad Rempel-USA TODAY Sports 8 Mike Moustakas - 3B - Royals \nInjury cut Moose's 2016 season short at 113 plate appearances, but some might look at that small sample size and think that he's not going to be an All-Star caliber player in 2017 — after all, he was hitting .240 with a .301 OBP. \nBut Moustakas was also holding a .214 BABIP with a strong hard-hit rate of more than 37 percent. \nThe number you want to pay attention to is .500 — his slugging percentage from last year. \nMoose had shown that he was capable of besting his impressive 2015 season (.284/.348/.470), and if he can do that in 2017, he'll enter elite company just as his contract expires. Kirby Lee Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports 7 Joe Panik - 2B - Giants \nPanik doesn't strike out and he has an absurd 95 percent contact rate on pitches thrown in the strike zone. The Giants second baseman might not have any power, but he deserved a better BABIP than .245. \nThat's an obvious sign that he'll progress. \nBut add in the fact that his vision never returned to normal last season after a beaning and concussion (he says it's back to normal now, thanks to eye exercises) and Panik is a clear pick to get back to All-Star form. Jennifer Stewart Jennifer Stewart-USA TODAY Sports 6 Gerrit Cole - SP - Pirates \nCole's problems aren't as simple as expecting his high .345 BABIP against number to fall. \nWhile his FIP was good last year — 3.33 — other metrics, like Deserved Run Average, were not kind to Cole. \nNo, the likely culprit for the bad season was the slider, which flattened out significantly in 2016. Hitters knew to sit on it, and they hit 75 points higher against it and slugged 95 points higher year-over-year, posting a gaudy .393 BABIP against. \nWhy did the slider fail Cole? It's hard to not blame a triceps injury he nursed last year. \nBack at 100 percent health, expect the slider's bite to return — it's not something that is going to go away without a reason — and Cole to find himself back among the best pitchers in the National League. Charles LeClaire Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports 5 Derek Norris - C - Padres \nI'm shocked Norris didn't quit baseball after last year — no player in the league was as snakebitten as the Padres' catcher. \nSeriously, it's sad to even type. I get frustrated thinking about it, and I barely know the guy. \nNorris had a 22 percent line-drive rate and he hit the ball hard 34.4 percent of the time. He should have posted a BABIP of .300 last year. \nInstead: .238. \nLife isn't fair and baseball is cruel. Gary A. Vasquez Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports 4 Shin-Soo Choo - OF - Rangers \nChoo didn't necessarily have a down year. An injured year, sure, but not a terrible year. \nThat said, for a player with a .278/.382/.447 slash line since 2009, a year where you slash .242/.357/.399, coming off two seasons where you didn't live up to your big contract is concerning, even if there were only 210 plate appearances. \nOn the plus side, Choo was wickedly unlucky in 2016. \nYes, he hits into the shift at an alarming rate, but 43 percent of his balls in play last year were hard-hit and he had a strong 22 percent line drive rate. \nHis .288 BABIP doesn't make much sense with those numbers — again, even with the shift. His expected BABIP with all that solid contact should have been .329. \nThere's no guarantee that Shoo will reach that level in 2017, but if he keeps doing what he did in 2016, his numbers should significantly improve. Troy Taormina Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports 3 \nA 4.55 ERA after a Cy Young-winning season? \nYeah, he's due for a bounceback. \nBut don't expect him to be a Cy Young candidate again. \nKeuchel's 2015 season was magical. His 2016 was a disaster. The truth lies in the middle (which might be his 2014 season...) \nIn 2015, Keuchel allowed a .269 BABIP — a career low by a wide margin. In 2016, that ballooned 35 points to just above league average — expect it to stay around there. \nSo why is Keuchel due for a bounceback? \nWell, he's coming off a season where he posted a FIP of 3.87 and an xFIP of 3.53 — solid, but not incredible. His ERA was 4.55. \nThat disparity won't persist in 2017. And if Keuchel does go back to his 2014 numbers (where he had a .294 BABIP against), look for a FIP just above 3. \nIt might not be Cy Young stuff, but after 2016, the Astros will take it in a heartbeat. \nTroy Taormina Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports 2 Zack Greinke - SP - Diamondbacks \nGreinke's first year of his massive new deal was an abject disaster. \nComing off a season where he posted a 1.66 ERA on a 2.76 FIP, Greinke posted a big, fat 4.37 ERA and his FIP didn't show much disparity. \nSo why is Greinke going to bounce back? \n1. It can't get much worse. \n2. He's now familiar with the ballpark formerly known as the BOB. \nPlenty of Greinke's problems last year came from playing in a homer-friendly ballpark and his inability to adjust to that reality. \nGreinke could get away with a lot a Dodger Stadium and before that, the cavernous Kaufmann. \nMost of the batted ball stats from 2015 to 2016 are the same, except for homers — Greinke's home run per fly ball ratio nearly doubled year-over-year. \nAdd in his lowest groundball to flyball ratio since 2010 and you have a recipe for disaster. \nGreinke will need to curtail the walks — but in his case, you can attribute a lot of that plate nibbling to a lack of confidence, brought about by all the longballs, and a lack of faith in the defense behind him (his BABIP against jumped 65 points year-to-year). \nGreinke will never be the pitcher with a sub-2 ERA again, but if he enters 2017 with the intent of keeping the ball down in the zone and inducing more groundballs, he'll be able to get it under 4 again. \nWith a strong defense (the kind the Diamondbacks don't seem interested in putting on the field in 2017) he could flirt with an ERA below 3 again. \nBut one step at a time. Gary A. Vasquez Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports 1 Jason Heyward - OF - Cubs \nLuck was not Heyward's problem in 2016 — he was a legitimately bad hitter (and outstanding fielder) because... well, you can see the photo above — does that look like a professional stance? \nHeyward had a massive hole in his swing last year, but it wasn't a new development — it could be traced back to his days in Atlanta: Heyward hasn't been above league-average when it comes to hard-hit balls since his third season in the league. \nHeyward has always been a swing tinkerer and he's had success with plenty of those tweaks over the years — time and time again, he could pull himself out of a cold spell and start a hot streak. And while the cold streaks ultimately reflected more in the box score, those adjustments matter. \nHeyward has spent the entire offseason rebuilding his swing. He's a whip-smart guy and the Cubs have some of the best resources in baseball (they're paying him a ton, after all) — if you can bet on anyone to re-invent themselves at age 27, it's Heyward. All he has to do is get his ISO (that's isolated power, slugging percentage minus average) above .150 (he did it in St. Louis) and he's an All-Star again. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:05:04.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
