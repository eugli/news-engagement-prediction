Great journey well done to all the management players and staff go again Saturday proud to be involved @suttonunited it was a pasty not pie. — Wayne Shaw (@wayneshaw70) February 21, 2017 \nBut the comic episode took a darker turn when it emerged the 46-year-old was taking part in a publicity stunt for a betting company who offered odds on Shaw eating a pie during the match. The incident was dubbed #piegate. Name a more iconic duo, we'll wait...Wayne Shaw To Eat A Pie Live On Air = 8/1 https://t.co/RbjPZpZ6NK #FACup #SUTARS pic.twitter.com/0YbfWbsHJh — Sun Bets (@SunBets) February 20, 2017 COST US A BELLY FULL: We've paid out a five-figure sum after @WayneShaw70 finishes his pie with glory! #YouBetcha #FACup pic.twitter.com/XrBCL3psOZ — Sun Bets (@SunBets) February 20, 2017 \nThe Football Association and Gambling Commission have launched investigations, but the club today moved to make clear Shaw had accepted the club’s request for him to resign. In a statement, the club said: \n“Wayne Shaw has resigned from his role at Sutton United following the events of last evening and subsequent publicity. He has said that he ‘fully understands the club’s position regarding this matter’. \n“We are naturally disappointed that Wayne’s time with us should end in this manner, and would like to thank him for his contribution to the club and wish him well for the future.” Bur Shaw had support from one of the most prominent names in football. So Wayne Shaw, who slept on a sofa 3 nights a week at Sutton to maintain and run the place loses his job over #piegate . FFS! — Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) February 21, 2017 Day by day football is losing its heart and its sense of humour. #piegate — Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) February 21, 2017 And Piers Morgan was of a similar mind. This Wayne Shaw sacking just about sums up the pathetically PC-crazed world we now have to endure. Shame on you, Sutton United. — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) February 21, 2017 So, if he'd consciously REFUSED to eat a pie, would that also be in breach of rules since people had bet on him doing so? https://t.co/3MBTwJ6ydw — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) February 21, 2017 \nAs well as being Sutton United’s substitute goalkeeper, Shaw is the club’s goalkeeping coach and takes on multiple odd-jobs in between - from caretaker of their plastic pitch to live-in community liaison officer. \nShaw has severed all ties with Sutton, the club confirmed, meaning he will no longer stay at the Gander Green Lane ground where he was sleeping some nights to help prepare for match days.
