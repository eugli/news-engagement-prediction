R-Pattz remained faithful to his kooky image in all-black from top to toe; a departure from Charlie's traditional suit and tie ensemble. Instead, Robert - who is engaged to singer FKA Twigs - favoured a roll neck jumper and wore his trousers tucked into military-style boots. Bold: The dress featured strategically placed blooms over the nipples What a waist! The waistband featured a Christian Dior namecheck Baring all: The dress is a design that has been popular among the A-list this season Suddenly shy: Sienna pulled a camel-coloured coat over her shoulders to keep warm, later Pose perfect: She was the screen siren that everyone turned out to see Sultry: The blonde bombshell offset the pretty flowers with her racy lipstick look There certainly seemed to be no animosity between Sienna and Robert when they shared a joke at the photocall, earlier that day. The 35-year-old beauty looked remarkably fresh faced after having enjoyed dinner with the Twilight actor and Charlie the previous evening. Sienna - who has four-year-old daughter Marlowe with Tom - looked fashion forward in her rust coloured coords for the cinematic event. Her box top and palazzo inspired pant combo hid her leafy physique as she beamed at the photocall with the film's leading men. Something for the fans: Robert stopped with the hoards of crowds to take pictures Time out: The actor was a total gentleman, spending time chatting to his admirers Kooky boots: R-Pattz wore military-style boots on the red carpet in an unorthodox fashion move The fashion darling's loose fitting two-piece also featured glittering pinstripe which helped elongate her petite frame beside her towering co-stars. The five-foot-five star - who plays the role of Nina Fawcett in the period movie - was still diminutive in comparison to her male counterparts, in spite of her head-turning mustard court heels. Helmed by Brad Pitt, The Lost City Of Z also stars BAFTA Rising Star winner Tom Holland and will premiere in theaters in the U.S. on April 21, 2017. Group shot: The actors posed with director James Gray on the night His film stars: The director looked proud in his navy velvet suit Meanwhile, Robert's interesting choice of knitwear served once again as a contrast to sharply dressed Hunnam. It featured a silver zip which he left semi-unopened to tease at his crisp untucked shirt as he completed his attire with a pair of black Adidas runners. Despite being known for his luscious locks while starring as vampire Edward Cullen in the Twilight series, he styled his mane into messy look in keeping with the outfit. To his left, English actor Charlie brought a tailored edge to the carpet in his dapper navy blue suit. Looking sharp, the 36-year-old star looked smart in his fitted two-piece which he matched with a simple white shirt, patterned tie and dark brown brogue. Inked: Sienna showed off her trio of star tattoos on her shoulder Nippy? She covered up in a camel coat as she gave press interviews J'Adore Dior: She sported Christian Dior boxers under her sheer dress Genetically blessed: Charlie Hunnam and Sienna made an attractive duo on the red carpet Known for his role in Sons Of Anarchy, he trimmed his trademark sandy coloured locks into a shorter style as he stopped for a snap with his on-screen wife Sienna. The trio appeared in high spirits as they promoted their new flick, despite having enjoyed a late night bite in the German city on Monday night, before their promotional duties. Accompanied by Charlie's wife Morgana McNelis, the cast mates arrived at Defne restaurant bar to tantalise their tastebuds and catch up before they descended on the city with aplomb for the film festival. Sienna and Robert appeared at ease in each other's company while they enjoyed a drink waiting for their food to arrive.
