A photo posted by Hilary Duff (@hilaryduff) on Nov 12, 2016 at 10:36am PST \nBut the road to body confidence wasn't always straightforward. On Thursday, Duff shared an empowering Instagram post that will remind you to love your body for all it does. \n\"I didn't always love my legs, but as I've grown, I've learned to love and celebrate myself, just as I am. I began to realize that my legs are STRONG and they carry me every. single. day,\" she wrote. \n\"Our bodies are amazing and something to be grateful for. I'm ME and that's really enough! Thanks for helping to spread the self love message @Aerie!\" A photo posted by Hilary Duff (@hilaryduff) on Feb 2, 2017 at 1:24pm PST \nShe isn't the only Aerie partner who is spreading the word. Model Iskra Lawrence shared a Valentine's Day 'gram in her lingerie, reminding us to indulge in the practice of self-love. \nVIDEO: Hilary Duff's Silliest Selfies \n\"I am going to celebrate the love I have for not just my body but also my heart and share that with all my loved ones. And tell body parts that I didn't used to love how I've fallen in love with them,\" she wrote. \n\"I cannot believe I used to punish my body daily and tell myself I wasn't good enough. As soon as I stopped comparing myself to others and seeing my body as my home and being grateful for all that it allows me to do not just what it looks like, I really fell in love with it.\" A photo posted by i s k r a (@iskra) on Feb 2, 2017 at 7:36am PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:05:38.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
