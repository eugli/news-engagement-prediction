MEPs warned against 'forcing ANOTHER UK vote to ratify Brexit deal’ A SECOND referendum? MEPs warned against 'forcing ANOTHER UK vote to ratify Brexit deal’ BRUSSELS bureaucrats have been threatened not to force Britain into holding a second referendum to ratify a Brexit deal as “no good can come of it”, according to both Remain and Leave supporters. PUBLISHED: 01:22,   02:30, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 GETTY Gove thinks talk of a second referendum encourages EU negotiators \nThe cosy meeting of Westminster minds was hosted by Commons Speaker John Bercow and it seems the Remain and Leave camps finally agree on something.Former Labour shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn and Vote Leave figurehead Michael Gove joined forces to urge Eurocrats not to force their agreement of any withdrawal deal, to a new referendum in the UK. Related articles Paul Nuttall receives backing of Ukip MEPs after 'Labour's smears' \nMr Gove said: \"It may well be that there is a current within the European Parliament that would like to see a second referendum in this country, but I am not necessarily convinced that it would be a position that would command a majority.\"Talk of a second referendum invites, almost, a bad deal. Brexit: Which parts of the UK had the majority vote? Fri, February 17, 2017 Much of the North East of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union including Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, and Northumberland. Newcastle was the only borough to vote to remain. Getty Images 1 of 8 GREAT YARMOUTH: The town of Great Yarmouth on the East Coast of England voted by 72% to leave the European Union. It would be counter-productive from every point of view Michael Gove \n\"It invites the European Union's negotiators to give us something that would automatically be thought of as substandard and which would be likely to trigger unhappiness in a second referendum.\"It would be counter-productive from every point of view.\" \nPro-Remain Mr Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, said: \"My own view is that it would be most unwise of the European Parliament to seek to attach such a condition.\"I don't see any evidence at all that the British people, I'm sorry to say, have changed their mind.\" GETTY Benn believes the want to leave the EU has not diminished in Britain \nMr Gove added: \"There are some people who look bleakly, pessimistically, at (the Brexit) decision, and who can imagine that no good can come of it.\"And there are others who are blithely optimistic and (that) everything from now on will be happiness and milk and honey.\"The truth, of course, is that there are significant opportunities available to Britain as a result of our decision to leave the European Union.\" PA After a difficult few weeks Bercow has not shrunk from his duties \nAfter recent well-publicised outbursts, many would think Bercow would be keeping a low profile but the speaker said divisions within society, released by Brexit are a concern.He said: “It is a concern, and has been widely articulated by people of a range of different points of view that during, and more particularly, in the aftermath of the referendum campaign, some very ugly sentiments were expressed, and doubtless that still continues.\"Such sentiments have, I think, consistently and uniformly been disavowed in terms unmistakable by my Parliamentary colleagues across the House.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:45:06.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
