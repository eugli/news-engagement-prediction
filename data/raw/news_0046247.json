That’s why they’re opening Badlands, a 30,000-square-foot interactive play space and learning center in Rockville, complete with special event rooms, nature-inspired play equipment, a maker space and a restaurant and cafe. 2 photos View of the unstructured play space planned for Badlands, a new kids' activity center in… more The Blairs’ children now range in age between 5 and 19, “but there was a period of time when they were all very young, and they were much more actively climbing the walls in our house than they are now,” Mikel Blair said in an interview. The space, which will open this spring, will be located in the former Safeway space in Loehmann's Plaza at 5200 Randolph Road in Rockville, which provides the requisite ceiling height for for a lifelike climbing “mountain” as well as a “forest” of stylized birch trees with a low-lying ropes course element and a maze. Mikel Blair hopes the combination of play spaces, maker spaces and media room will provide varying activities that help hold kids’ attention spans. The space will have activities appropriate for babies up through 12-year-olds. “Through the years I’ve observed kids’ innate nature to want to run and climb and jump off of things and that might change within a few minutes or seconds to becoming still and wanting to explore what’s in the grass,” Mikel said. But she hadn’t found many places that can accommodate both. Kids can’t jump on exhibits in a science museum, for example, or they can become bored after 20 minutes at, say, a trampoline facility when parents have paid for an hour of time. “We wanted to do a space for something that has both, as well as place for me as a parent, who might not want a juice box and Goldfish, where we can grab a bite before we move on to the next thing,” said Mikel. Badlands will have unstructured play spaces presided over by instructors, allowing parents to relax in the cafe while their children are supervised. There will also be structured workshops in the maker space and classes, such as a Mindful Mountaineers class that will take children ages 4-6 through series of gym and enrichment activities. Badlands has an amphitheater and screening room for classes and group activities, and event pavilions that can be rented out for birthday parties and other private events. In the cafe, adults can chose from items such as paninis, soups and salads and a full range of coffee beverages and teas as well as beer, wine and specialty cocktails. There’s also a kids’ menu. Pricing is still being determined, though there will be different prices for walk-ins, for packages and for membership, as well as discounts for families bringing more than one child. The name actually came from the Blair’s eldest son, who was studying geology and brought up the term. “I looked it up and one of the first descriptions was ‘varying terrain, many ways to navigate,’” Mikel said. “And it landed on me. That was it.” The kids’ space is quite the departure for David Blair , a partner in Monumental Sports & Entertainment who started his career in the health industry. Blair served as Catalyst Health Solutions Inc.’s CEO as it grew from a $5 million to a $5.3 billion company, spearheading its sale in 2012 in a deal that was expected to yield him $16 million personally. He joined Monumental in 2013. So will Badlands grow the way David Blair ’s other ventures have? It’s too soon to tell. “One can dream,” Mikel says, “but right now I’m really focused on doing this one really well.” Rebecca Cooper covers retail, restaurants, tourism and the arts.
