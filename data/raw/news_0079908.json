Michael Regan/Getty Images But the old guard responded, which surely would have left Ranieri wondering where that commitment had been following just five previous league wins this term.\nThere was no vitriol from the supporters as Leicester faced Liverpool having dropped into the bottom three over the weekend.\nVardy was lucky to escape punishment after catching Sadio Mane on the ankle as the home team signalled their robust and determined intent early on.\nThe Foxes had rarely been so energetic this season and Simon Mignolet made two smart saves from Robert Huth and Shinji Okazaki before the visitors even got into the Leicester box.\nWhen they did, Wes Morgan denied Joel Matip a tap-in by scrambling away Mane's cross and the hosts' momentum subsided as the Reds began to see more of the ball.\nBut they needed Mignolet to bail them out after 19 minutes when Lucas Leiva made hash a of Kasper Schmeichel's clearance, only for Vardy to miscue and Mignolet saved with his legs.\nYet there was no stopping the England striker, in front of the watching Gareth Southgate, nine minutes later when he put Leicester ahead with their first league goal of 2017 and first in 637 minutes.\nLiverpool failed to get hold of the ball in midfield and Marc Albrighton instantly split the visitors' defence with a first-time ball to put Vardy clean through.\nHe easily slotted past Mignolet for his first Premier League goal in almost three months in a throwback to last season, when he thrived on such service.\nThe revived Foxes continued to press -- although they needed Schmeichel to save at Coutinho's feet -- and doubled their lead six minutes before the break thanks to Drinkwater's excellent strike.\nJames Milner could only half-clear Albrighton's cross to the England midfielder and, 25 yards out, he unleashed a stunning half volley into the corner.\nSchmeichel still needed to save Emre Can's bouncing attempt before half-time and Liverpool toiled with the ball but never threatened Schmeichel after the break before Vardy sealed the game on the hour mark.\nNeat play from Riyad Mahrez and Christian Fuchs saw the latter flummox Adam Lallana and cross for Vardy to power in a header from close range.\nLiverpool still had some fight left and Schmeichel saved from Lallana before Coutinho pulled a goal back with a fine low finish with 22 minutes left, but it was all too late.\nDrinkwater and Lucas traded half chances and Schmeichel almost spilled Coutinho's late effort, but Leicester's post-Ranieri era began with an impressive victory.", "external_links": ["http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0227%2Fr184621_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=375,", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?lang=en&url=http%3A%2F%2Fes.pn%2F2mxmN6Z&text=Leicester%20stun%20Liverpool%20in%20first%20match%20since%20sacking%20Claudio%20Ranieri", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?href=http%3A%2F%2Fes.pn%2F2mxmN6Z&app_id=116656161708917", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0227%2Fr184621_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=750&cquality=40", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0227%2Fr184621_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=1140&cquality=40", "http://es.pn/2mxmN6Z", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0227%2Fr184621_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=570,", "https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fespnfc.com%2Freport%3FgameId%3D450751&description=Leicester+stun+Liverpool+in+first+match+since+sacking+Claudio+Ranieri&media=http%3A%2F%2Fa.espncdn.com%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0227%2Fr184621_1296x729_16-9.jpg", "http://facebook.com/dialog/send?link=http://es.pn/2mxmN6Z&next=http://es.pn/2mxmN6Z&app_id=116656161708917"], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:13:14.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
