But he shares his boss’ hard-charging reputation. \nMcGahn’s preferred operating style at the FEC—working with loyalists, pushing a deregulatory agenda, and battling insubordinates and colleagues who disagreed with him—might foreshadow what he now could do in the White House, only with a much larger and more powerful platform. This scares critics of his FEC career, who argue that he can be as much of a bully as his new boss. \n“McGahn will embolden Trump,” says a former FEC official. “He is not going to be a truth teller. He’s going to be an enabler.” \nWhere’s your red line, enablers?

Dave Weigel /WaPo (who at least identifies these folks as rally goers, interesting but don’t count as representative of country or all Trump voters: \nTrump supporters see a successful president — and are frustrated with critics who don’t Many of President Trump’s most dedicated supporters — the sort who waited for hours in the Florida sun this weekend for his first post-inauguration campaign rally — say their lives changed on election night. Suddenly they felt like their views were actually respected and in the majority. But less than one month into Trump’s term, many of his supporters say they once again feel under attack — perhaps even more so than before. x — Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) February 21, 2017 \n2. Washingtonian (before Milo Yiannopoulos resigned) : \nBreitbart Employees Threaten Walk-Out Over Milo \nA senior editor at the right-wing publication tells Washingtonian that “at least a half-dozen” employees are prepared to leave the company if Milo Yiannopoulos is not promptly fired. A second Breitbart source confirms this estimate \nWe care about different things than social conservatives. Jonathan Haidt has written much about it, and to see the power of the concept, look at Milo and sanctity. Pedophilia/Milo violates sanctity/degradation and SHOULD be anathema. Also subverts authority because not consensual. \nHaving (white) kids in the conservative movement explains why this, and not misogyny, racism, trans-trash talk, etc was a red line. But the point is, there are red lines for conservatives. Find what they are. Once crossed the glamour, maybe, will be broken. \nMilo Yiannopoulos and the Church of Winning \nBy excusing Donald Trump’s behavior, some evangelical leaders enabled the internet provocateur’s ascent. \nIf Yiannopoulos is a cultural leader for what remains of the conservative movement, then conservatism does not represent millions of people who once claimed it as their philosophical home. But it remains to be seen how the throngs of Trump-supporting Milo fans react to what will undoubtedly be referred to as a silencing of free speech. And already they are making a concerted effort to paint the dissent that led to his downfall as the work of the same group of #NeverTrump conservatives that Trump fans believe symbolizes the “death throes of the Establishment.” \nThey’re right. That’s precisely who threw a wrench in CPAC’s plans to ride the coverage of controversy that a Milo speech would bring. \nBut what’s more notable is who did not intervene: evangelical leaders. \nMilo’s ascent over the last year was, to a tragic extent, enabled by the willingness of some evangelical leaders to offer their endorsement for the very behavior on display today. \nJeremy Peters /NY Times: \nConservatives reacted with near unanimous disgust at the comments. Some expressed bewilderment that conference organizers would extend an invitation to Mr. Yiannopoulos in the first place, given his history of statements that have been offensive to blacks and Muslims, and have generally pushed the bounds of decency. Twitter has banned him. \n“Colossal misjudgment,” Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, wrote on Twitter . “Now CPAC has put itself in the role of ‘censor.’ And for what? Some clicks and headlines?” \nConsider that Milo’s appeal (and Trump’s) is that power works, and if we have it we can do anything. well, Milo lost a speaking tour, a book offer from Simon and Schuster, Breidbart job and mojo. Might doesn’t make right. Overall, a good day. x \nPerson who invited Milo to CPAC conference just told Morning Joe that the alt-right has no place in the conservative movement ... — Eugene Scott (@Eugene_Scott) February 21, 2017 x \nIt's official: the overwhelming majority of unauthorized immigrants in the US are now priorities for deportation. https://t.co/gHG4iVElgE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:24:46.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
