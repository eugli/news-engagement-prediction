Flynn now says he doesn’t remember if he spoke about sanctions with Kislyak.\nThe Washington Post reported Saturday that nine former and current officials remembered Flynn explicitly referring to the sanctions that Obama strengthened about the time of the call to Kislyak.\nAll of those officials said ­Flynn’s references to the election-related sanctions were explicit. Two of those officials went further, saying that Flynn urged Russia not to overreact to the penalties being imposed by President Barack Obama, making clear that the two sides would be in position to review the matter after Trump was sworn in as president.\n“Kislyak was left with the impression that the sanctions would be revisited at a later time,” said a former official.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has called for Flynn’s resignation Sunday , while Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) demanded that the transcript of the Flynn exchange be released.\nMonday Trump’s top advisor Kellyanne Conway assured MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki that the reports were overblown. “Yes, General Flynn does enjoy the full confidence of the president,” she claimed in defiance of the “personnel crisis” being reported in the media.\nJUST IN: Gen.
