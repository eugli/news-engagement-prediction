While the numbers expectedly saw a dip on Monday, the film saw a slight rise on Tuesday. The Sanjay Gupta-directed film collected Rs 6.10 crore on Day 7, thus taking the total collections to Rs 79.60 crore. That's not a bad figure for a film that completes its first week at theatres. What should also be noted here is that 'Kaabil' got 40 per cent screens in comparison to Shah Rukh Khan 's 'Raees' that released alongside.\nThe film industry and trade analysts alike were tad worried about two big ticket films clashing at the theatres. However, the good news is that both movies have managed to hold their ground and make their presence felt at the box-office.\nThe Rakesh Roshan production has received glowing reviews from critics and now, the box-office figures prove that it has won the audience's hearts too. Hrithik, in particular, has won tremendous appreciation for his portrayal of a visually-challenged man.\nWhat works in favour of both 'Kaabil' and 'Raees' is that there is no big Bollywood release slated for the coming weekend. The Hrithik and Yami Gautam starrer will enjoy an open window at the theatres during its second weekend.\nHere's a low down of 'Kaabil' box-office collections till date:\nDay 1 Rs 10.43 Cr Day 2 Rs 18.67 Cr Day 3 Rs 9.77 Cr Day 4 Rs 13.54 Cr Day 5 Rs 15.05 Cr Day 6 Rs 6.04 Cr Day 7 Rs 6.10 Cr", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:04:48.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
