"text": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard have called the shooting at a Quebec City mosque on Sunday that left six people dead a \"terrorist attack,\" while others have qualified it as a \"hate crime.\"\nIt's a debate Quebec's Muslim community is watching closely, but legal experts say it's one that will have little impact on the kind of sentence the accused shooter Alexandre Bissonnette might face if convicted.\nFull coverage of the Quebec City mosque attack Added to Canada's Criminal Code following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, terrorism is defined as an act that is committed \"for a political, religious or ideological purpose, objective or cause\" that has \"the intention of intimidating the public, or a segment of the public with regard to its security.\"\nIn order to lay terrorism-related charges against Bissonnette, prosecutors would have to be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that that was the motivation behind the attack which killed six worshippers and wounded 19 others at the Quebec Islamic cultural centre.\nPortrait of a suspect: Alexandre Bissonnette's journey from moderate conservative to extremist troll Quebec Muslims 'are terrorized' Haroun Bouazzi, co-president of the Association des Musulmans et des Arabes pour la Laicité au Quebec, told CBC Montreal's Daybreak Wednesday that \"intimidated\" is exactly how he and other Muslims in Quebec are feeling.\n\"Today, the Muslim minority is terrorized, they're actually scared, and this is, from my point of view, terrorism,\" he said.\nFaisal Bhabha, an associate professor at York University's Osgoode Hall Law School who is also involved in anti-discrimination initiatives, said it's impossible to ignore the political and social context in which these decisions are made.\nMen of colour and Muslim men in particular are more likely to face terror charges than white male mass shooters such as Justin Bourque, the New Brunswick man convicted in 2014 of killing three RCMP officers, he said.\nQuebec Premier Philippe Couillard has called the mosque shootings an act of terrorism, though the accused shooter, Alexandre Bissonnette, has not been charged with terrorism-related offences. (Jacques Boissinot/Canadian Press)\n'No real purpose' to pursuing terror charges It's a decision, however, that legal professionals say will ultimately have no noticeable impact if Bissonnette is found guilty on the six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder with which he's now charged.\nCriminal defence lawyer Eric Sutton said even if the shootings fit the definition of a terrorist act, prosecutors would have little to gain from pursuing terror charges against Bissonnette.\n\"He's facing multiple charges of murder, and the potential sentence goes beyond whatever could be imposed on him even if he was charged with terrorist activities,\" Sutton said. \"There's no real purpose.\"\n\"If he's convicted of these crimes, he may never get out of jail.\"\nAlleged shooter in Quebec City attack was at mosque Thursday, member says\nPeople attend a vigil for victims of the mosque shooting in Quebec City Monday, January 30, 2017 in Montreal. (Ryan Remiorz/CP)\n150 years without chance of parole? Under the 2011 federal legislation, entitled the Protecting Canadians by Ending Sentence Discounts for Multiple Murders Act, the six counts of first-degree murder that Bissonnette faces could mean he wouldn't be eligible for parole for 150 years, if he were to be found guilty on all counts.\nA first-degree murder conviction carries an automatic life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years, and the act allows for those 25-year periods to be consecutive, in cases of multiple murders.\nFor the 2014 killings, Bourque was sentenced to 75 years before being eligible for parole.\nBourque's sentence was the stiffest passed in Canada since the abolition of the death penalty.\nJustin Bourque gets 5 life sentences, no chance of parole for 75 years\nSources close to Radio-Canada said the prosecution in Bissonnette's case \"will certainly study\" the possibility of pursuing a similar course.\nDefence lawyer and former Crown prosecutor Julien Grégoire told Radio-Canada Wednesday that his experience suggests prosecutors will stay focused on proving the current murder and attempted murder charges against Bissonnette beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\"I would concentrate my energies, my knowledge, my experience on trying to obtain a conviction on the charges he already faces,\" Grégoire said.\n'Hate can lead to carnage': Quebec City mosque opens doors to reveal shooting aftermath Quebec City surgeon's Afghanistan experience prepared him for mosque victims Quebec City community holds mass, creates schoolyard monument to honour victims\nWith files from The Canadian Press and Radio-Canada's Yannick Bergeron", "external_links": ["http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-12.html#h-25"], "published": "2017-02-02T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:07:12.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
