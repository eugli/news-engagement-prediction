But humankind has been a major contributor in a relatively very small period of time, as Dr Karl Kruszelnicki argues. \nAbout four-and-a-half billion years ago, our planet slowly formed out of the primordial gas and dust of a stellar nursery, and it's been changing ever since. The main forces that have changed our planet are astronomy, geology and biology. \nExamples would include (respectively) the asteroid strike that helped wipe out the non-flying dinosaurs, volcanoes and continental drift, and photosynthesis that brought oxygen into our atmosphere. \nSince 1750, we have dumped about 555 billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere. \nBut now it's pretty clear that human activity is changing the planet. And one of the early big markers was how the genocide of the vast majority of humans living in the Americas led to an accidentally cooling of the Earth. \nThe geologists call the current epoch of time the holocene—meaning in Greek, 'totally new or recent'. \nBut now the geologists are beginning to talk about the need to introduce a new epoch—the Anthropocene, from 'anthrop' meaning 'people'. \nOur planet is about 12,500 kilometres across, and you could fit all the humans into a box smaller than one kilometre on a side. Nevertheless, we humans have had measurable effects on the planet. \nSome 50,000 to 10,000 years ago, we set off the great megafauna extinction. \nAbout 10,000 years ago we invented agriculture—and today about 25 to 38 per cent of the world's primary productivity has been appropriated for human use. \nIn the early 20th Century, we invented the Haber-Bosch Process. It dragged inert nitrogen out of the atmosphere and turned it into fertiliser. It changed the 'global nitrogen cycle so fundamentally that the nearest ... geological comparison (happened) about 2.5 billion years ago'. \nEach year, we humans shift about 57 billion tonnes of rock, dirt, sand, iron ore and coal, which is about three times as much as all the world's rivers shift. \nSince 1750, we have dumped about 555 billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere. \nOne side-effect is that by melting ice near the poles, we have (but ever so slightly) tipped the Earth off its axis. \nAs another example, the global nuclear fallout from above-ground nuclear bomb tests has left a spike in carbon-14 levels back in the mid-1960s. \nEven though there are now scientific peer-reviewed journals dedicated to the Anthropocene, the actual 'Anthropocene epoch' has not yet been formally ratified into the geological time scale by the International Union of Geological Sciences. \nDid you know Great Moments In Science is a podcast?

The landscape was dominated by human activity. \nFor example, the Amazon was not the pristine rainforest we image. In 1542, Gaspar de Carvajal described fertile fields, roads and cities along the banks of the major rivers. \nHe wrote: 'There was one town that stretched for 15 miles without any space from house to house ... The land is as fertile and as normal in appearance as our Spain.' \nBut the invading Europeans had superior weapons technology. By a combination of war, enslavement, famine and exposure to unfamiliar diseases, the population of the Americas dropped from 55 million in 1492 to about six million by 1650. This led to a near-cessation of both fire usage and farming. \nAs a result, there was a natural regeneration of some half-million square kilometres of forest, grasslands and woody savanna. \nThe vegetation and soils dragged about 20 billion tonnes of carbon out of the atmosphere. This then caused a global decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide of about 7 to 10 parts per million—and almost certainly contributed to the Little Ice Age of the early 1600s. \nThis drop in carbon dioxide will be in the geological record for millions of years. \nOver the last few millennia, scientific discoveries have shifted the perception that we humans are the very centre of the Universe. But the concept of the Anthropocene epoch tells us that we humans can wield truly mighty powers. \nBut with great power, comes great responsibility ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:55:54.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
