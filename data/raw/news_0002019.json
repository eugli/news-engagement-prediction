Beyonce Reveals She's Expecting Twins! \nThe Carters will welcome two new members to the Beyhive. By Libby Ryan Comments \nBow down to Queen Bey, who's about to be a mama of twins! \nThe superstar posted on Instagram (in her iconically dramatic style), complete with a caption sharing the news that she and husband Jay Z are expecting! Beyonce, clad in lingerie, posed veiled against a backdrop of colorful flowers in a serene shot. A photo posted by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST \n\"We would like to share our love and happiness,\" read the caption. \"We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes.\" \nThe photo was signed \"The Carters\" and we can't wait to see the red carpet appearances the whole family will make when the Carters get in formation. Considering how Blue Ivy slayed her award show debut at the VMAs last summer, couture ballgown and all, we think this future big sister will show her new siblings the ropes. \nCongratulations to the soon-to-be family of five!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:35:24.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
