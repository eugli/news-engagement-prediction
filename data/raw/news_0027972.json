Study participants included 118 MBA students with full-time jobs who took a survey and then wore activity monitors for a week. \nA follow-up survey was then sent to the participants` cohabitants.Taylor said the study found that burning an additional 587 calories can reduce the harmful effects of mistreatment and help prevent it from carrying into the home.
