By Sarah Glatte & Joseph D'Urso BBC political research unit 21 February 2017 Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Thinking about E numbers might stir up images of hyperactive children guzzling fluorescent soft drinks. But have you ever wondered what the E stands for? \nLooking at this system of food additives can help illustrate some of the tough issues facing the British government as it prepares to leave the European Union. \nThe European Council introduced food colouring legislation in 1962 alongside a number classification system. In the 1990s the scheme was expanded to cover all additives permitted to be used in food sold in the EU and now forms a key part of UK food and drink regulation. \nThe government wants to begin formal Brexit negotiations by the end of March, after which UK laws will be made \"not in Brussels but in Westminster\", according to Prime Minister Theresa May. \nSo will the UK ditch E numbers and come up with a new system for assessing and labelling food additives? And what about the many other areas of UK regulation currently set by EU law? Dial E for Europe \nFor a substance to be permitted for use as a food additive in the EU, it must be given an E number (the E stands for Europe). Codes like E101, E150d and E1209 are assigned to substances which change food colour, taste, shelf life or other properties. \nFor example E160b, or annatto, gives Red Leicester cheese its distinctive glow. \nE numbers are often associated with processed food. Some, like E122, may have adverse effects on children prone to hyperactivity according to the NHS. \nBut most are perfectly benign and lots are good for us, like E300, otherwise known as Vitamin C. \nAt the moment if a food company comes up with a new additive, it must seek authorisation from an expert panel at the European Food Standards Agency. This EU body is made up of scientists from across the continent, including two from the UK. \nThey are experts in chemistry, toxicology and other relevant fields and meet regularly to assess which additives are safe. Once agreed, these substances must be clearly labelled on food sold in the UK or elsewhere in the EU. What happens next? \nAs part of the Brexit process, the government has announced it will introduce a \"Great Repeal Bill\" in the next Queen's Speech. \nThis will remove the European Communities Act 1972 from the statute book and enshrine all existing EU law into British law, before the government decides which to keep and which to jettison. \nThis is likely to include EU regulations on food additives and labelling. \nHowever such an approach opens up a number of other questions. \nFor example, what would happen when the EU changes its list of E numbers - will the UK adopt or ignore the new rules? \nIf it adopts them, how does this square with the government's wish that laws be made in Westminster and if it ignores E number changes, will domestic food companies be able to trade freely with European suppliers?
