Photo: Getty Images \n\"I'm really hoping and asking for the fans to come. We're putting in wonderful displays, there are 8-and-a-half thousand that went home tonight extremely happy,\" Arnold said. \n\"I totally realise it's school this week, first week of school and there are pretty much no kids under the age of 15 here nearly. That's the way it is, but against Melbourne, our interstate rival, we need our fans here in numbers because they can make a huge difference. The boys deserve that with their performances they've been putting in.\" \nTwo sublime team goals finished by Rhyan Grant and Bobo, alongside a classy finish from Milos Ninkovic sealed Sydney's win over Wellington. Arnold likened the movement in the build-up to the team goals to a training run, such was the fluidity in possession and the ease in which they cut through Wellington's backline. \n\"The second goal was like a training drill that we practiced. The execution was perfect,\" Arnold said. \n\"On another night we could have had five or six and that's where we're aiming to be. I keep saying that we're only about 50, 60 or 70 per-cent of our qualities and I still believe there's so much improvement in that front four.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:26:59.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
