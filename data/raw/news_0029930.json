The 2017 SI Swimsuit Covers have been revealed. Welcome back, @KateUpton !

Happy that Kate Upton is the SI Swimsuit cover model but it's funny that of 3 cover photos, not one is an actual swimsuit you could wear. — Tiffany Schilling (@tiffffanyd) February 15, 2017 @KateUpton @SI_Swimsuit congrats! But 3 covers of a \"swimsuit issue\" and only one half of a swimsuit in total, got me 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 — Alex Struckmeyer (@struckalex) February 15, 2017 I love that Kate upton is on 3 SI covers and on all 3 combined she's wearing half a swimsuit \nElle Magazine pointed it out in the headline of their Upton article : Kate Upton is pretty much naked on three different Sport's Illustrated Swimsuit Issue covers, no swimsuit in sight: https://t.co/4dT0mGwcyT ? pic.twitter.com/vov8PR4SdW — ELLE Magazine (US) (@ELLEmagazine) February 15, 2017 \nAnd CNN’s Jake Tapper even chimed in for some unknown reason: @KateUpton those bathing suits look impractical — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 15, 2017 \nPerez Hilton might’ve said it best when he broke down her “swimsuits” cover by cover: \n“One cover (above) has her topless with her bottom half clad in a bunch of necklaces, basically,” he wrote. “A second cover features her in a bunch of string made to resemble a maillot, while a third one finally has her in honest-to-God bikini bottoms and a long-sleeved embellished top.” \nAs we all know, the Swimsuit Edition hasn’t ever really been about the swimsuits at all. If we’re all getting really nit-picky, there’s usually a body paint section in the magazine, so those don’t even begin to count as bathing suits. \nIf people are going to take issue with anything in the Swimsuit Edition, let’s figure out why Serena Williams or 63-year-old Christie Brinkley didn’t land the cover. Especially since Upton herself said this issue’s theme was about “every woman of every age and every body type being accepted. It was inspiring to be asked to be a part of that issue.” \nThe HuffPost Lifestyle newsletter will make you happier and healthier, one email at a time. Sign up here.
