Bad jokes aplenty. Can be gently prodded on Twitter at @kitsb1 \n(WARNING: The following contains major plot SPOILERS for the most recent episode of AMC's The Walking Dead , right from the get-go. If you haven't yet seen this past Sunday's episode, \"New Best Friends,\" then proceed with whatever level of caution that suggests to you is wise.) \nNow, for fans of #AMC 's #TheWalkingDead who prefer their post-apocalyptic wastelands to be full of less talking, and more brutally zombie-fied violence, the most recent episode of the show's seventh season was likely something of a revelation. After all, where much of Season 7 has focused on a gentle combination of moping, plotting and wandering around, this past Sunday's \"New Best Friends\" brought exactly the sort of giant pile of mildly silly ultra-violence that the show has long been beloved for. The Ultimate 'The Walking Dead' Season 7 Guide: News, Recaps, Promos & All You Need To Know \nYup, that's right. #AndrewLincoln 's #RickGrimes was just forced to battle for his life against a spike-filled walker named Winslow in precisely the sort of \"pit of hell\" that you'd expect a post-apocalyptic wasteland to be full of (and which you can watch down below). And, because the internet is a thing: Andrew Lincoln Just Opened Up About 'The Walking Dead's 'Pit Of Hell' 'The Walking Dead' [Credit: AMC] \nSpecifically, Lincoln just spent a large chunk of a recent interview with EW discussing what it was like to fight a monstrous, spike-filled walker — and his response may not be quite what you'd expect: \n\"We got lucky with the weather and Atlanta took pity on us that day when I got thrown into the pit of hell and had to wrestle with my dear friend Gino, who played the spiky pinheaded monster there. It was insane. I lost my mind that day. It was so much fun. Mike Satrazemis, who does the camera work, loves getting hurt as much as I do, and he sent me a shot of me all bandaged and bruised and cuts and blood everywhere, looking as happy as I’ve ever been in the pit — in this dirty, smelly environment, and it’s just like, what a life! It was just such a gas, that whole episode. It was just a breath of fresh air. It’s insane.\" 'The Walking Dead' [AMC] \nSo, if The Walking Dead winds up being full of similarly Mad Max -ian scenes of gladiatorial battling, it seems you can most likely chalk that up to Lincoln himself lobbying for them behind the scenes — not least because it seems that he wasn't the only one who had a good time during the scene's filming: \n\"Well, Norman came and there were quite a few people watching. And also the people at the top as I was climbing out of the thing, they were looking at me going, 'Wow, that’s a workout.' I was like 'Yeah!’ But it was such fun, man. It was such a wild, strange departure for this show — in a good way, in a really invigorating way, because it was pushing the envelope of what we’ve been known for. And the landscape and the characters, in all areas — it’s just flexing ourselves and seeing if it fit, you know what I mean? And I think the new guys that joined us were magnificent. I called them Kraftwerk. I kept looking at them going, I’m in some ’80s Kraftwerk movie! It was very strange.\" \nKraftwerk meets Mad Max meets The Walking Dead ? Season 8 might just have a lot to live up to. \nWhat do you think, though? Were you a fan of The Walking Dead 's very own Winslow boy? Let us know below!
