Vice President Mike Pence strongly opposes abortion, citing his Catholic beliefs, and the newly confirmed Health secretary, Tom Price, has supported cutting off taxpayer money to Planned Parenthood. \nFederal dollars don't pay for abortions, but the organization is reimbursed by Medicaid for other services, including birth control and cancer screenings. Anti-abortion conservatives have long tried to cut Planned Parenthood funds, arguing that the reimbursements help subsidize abortions. \nPlanned Parenthood says it performed 324,000 abortions in 2014, the most recent year tallied, but the vast majority of women using their services seek out contraception, testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases or cancer screenings. \nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says defunding plans would cut roughly $400 million in Medicaid money from the group in the year after enactment and would result in roughly 400,000 women losing access to care. \nRepublicans would redirect the funding to community health centers, but Planned Parenthood supporters say women denied Medicaid services from Planned Parenthood may not be able to find replacement care. \nAt the nonprofit's New York headquarters, supporters outnumbered a group of 50 abortion-rights opponents by a ratio of 3-to-1, and thousands rallied separately at Washington Square Park to support Planned Parenthood. In the Seattle suburb of Kent, 300 supporters turned out, as opposed to a couple dozen opponents, KOMO-TV reported. \nBy contrast, in the deeply conservative western Iowa city of Council Bluffs, two dozen anti-abortion demonstrators drew no counter-rally. \nOutside a Planned Parenthood clinic in the Dallas suburb of Plano, about 20 anti-abortion protesters gathered — a few more than a typical Saturday, attendees said. They bore signs reading \"Abortion Kills Children,\" ''Pray to End Abortion\" and \"Men Regret Lost Fatherhood.\" \nMaria Nesbitt, 47, participated along with her husband and daughters, ages 5 and 3, and said she was pleased about Trump's election and the prospect of cutting Planned Parenthood's funding. She and the girls held signs saying \"Pray to End Abortion,\" though she said they're too young to understand what it means. \nNearby, Anthony Hodgson, 57, held a sign with the same message. \"I believe it's not right. God told us, 'Thou shalt not kill,' \" he said.
