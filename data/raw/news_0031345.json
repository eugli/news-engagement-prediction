The prime minister said it was Alberta’s climate leadership that opened the door to the pipeline approvals. \nBut the province has experienced quite a bit of backlash over its climate policies, including the much-maligned carbon tax , which came into effect Jan. 1. \nWatch below: What will Alberta’s carbon tax cost you? Laurel Gregory takes a look. \nSeveral people on Twitter appeared frustrated, or even angered by the government’s playful message. @albertaNDP more like \"piling a suffocating deficit on your future through our incompetent management\" #ableg #FireNotley #ScrapTheNDP \n— Lisa (@MissCareless198) February 14, 2017 \nJanet Brown, a political analyst from Calgary, told News Talk 770 she expects the greeting will simply reinforce Albertans’ opinions on the NDP. \n“If it was an attempt to change anyone’s mind or make them feel any better about the NDP , it was probably misguided,” Brown said. \n“If it was just a way to express something jovial to people who already support you, then it wasn’t a bad idea.” \nWhile several people responded with anger over the government’s policies, especially as the Alberta economy continues to struggle in the wake of low oil prices, others sought to shine a spotlight on the perceived environmental impact of the pipelines and the impact on First Nations communities. \n— Katie Jensen (@katiejensen) February 14, 2017 @albertaNDP Right through the hearts of First Nations people.
