The Awami League leaders later said they meant use of EVMs by E-voting. \nThe BNP has criticised the proposal, saying the use of EVMs would open gates to 'digital corruption'. The use of EVMs will make the casting and counting of votes faster and cheaper.\nThe EC headed by ATM Shamsul Huda used EVMs in some local government elections for the first time in 2010 and prepared the machines for the 2014 parliamentary election before leaving office in 2012. \nThe last commission of Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmad, however, discarded the machines amidst complexities over those and the BNP's opposition. \nOn Wednesday, the prime minister also stressed the need for a law to form the EC. \n\"We want a suitable law to appoint the chief election commissioner and the other commissioners. We can take the steps in this regard now in line with the Constitution,\" she said. \nHasina hailed the process followed to form the two last ECs. \"It has strengthened our democracy,\" she said. \nThe new EC and the last one were constituted through search committees formed by the president following dialogues with political parties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:58:07.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
