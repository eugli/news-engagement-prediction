Now, he will grow up like a normal child without any deformity.”\nThe couple also have a three-year-old son who Chennabasava says was “born normal”.\nView photos\nThe baby with mum Lalitamma and dad Chennabasava (SWNS) More\nMORE: Australian man builds three-metre barbed wire fence around his home to keep his ex out\nMORE: Bluebells could struggle to cope with rising temperatures and a shift in spring\nHe added: “When I saw this my infant with four limbs and two genitals, I was shocked. I thought God might have punished me for my sins that I might have committed inadvertently. I thought it was a curse on our family.\n“But then the almighty sent the these living gods, the doctors to fix the deformity and gift my son a new life and give us a new hope and reinstate our trust on human values of sympathy, empathy and compassion.”\nView photos\nThe baby was born on January 21 in what doctors said was a normal delivery (SWNS) More The baby was born on January 21 at Dhadeasugure Primary Health Centre in Raichur, Karnataka.\nHe was admitted to the Narayana Health City Hospital in Bengaluru a few days later.\nA team of doctors, led by Dr Ashley D’Cruz, performed ultrasounds and x-rays to check the operation could go ahead a few days later.\nDr Sanjay Rao said: “The parasitic twin does not have its own heart and circulation. It was getting blood supply from the baby.\n“Therefore, it was important for us to know where the blood-supply and blood vessels are connected so that we could safely separate the two.”\n“The baby on its own was fine and didn’t have any major anomalies or complications.\n“Therefore, it was critical to define everything and plan the surgery meticulously.\nView photos\nSuccess: The baby is doing well after his operation and no major issues are anticipated (SWNS) More Dr D’Cruz added: “Looking at the baby now, we don’t see any major issue. The baby is doing fine and has started feeding on mother’s milk.\n“There could be some minor issues as the child grows up. We have to monitor the child to ensure things are going the right way.\n“At present there is nothing to suggest that the child will have problems or may not have normal development.”", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QApNmqQkpHSVBu6eZCm4cA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzIwO2g9NDgw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/666cc141c940e88fb74bfd7136a19044);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fhxsMqWyDrco_bHqK4efvA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzIwO2g9NDgw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/85f1ad8333d152b0fb4f5a5ce6003e3c", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MoE_JU5ib87hucibdh3tLg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzIwO2g9NDgw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0803db71d927cbc6258d94ffa0005fa1", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OJJ9AEDnVZ1RVA2ZF8Q_uw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzIwO2g9NTQw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/cadb9e7b9e5e0409134472caae256223", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QApNmqQkpHSVBu6eZCm4cA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzIwO2g9NDgw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/666cc141c940e88fb74bfd7136a19044", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MoE_JU5ib87hucibdh3tLg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzIwO2g9NDgw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0803db71d927cbc6258d94ffa0005fa1);", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fhxsMqWyDrco_bHqK4efvA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzIwO2g9NDgw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/85f1ad8333d152b0fb4f5a5ce6003e3c);", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif"], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T14:48:37.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
