Russia! Russia!\" \nRelated: Democrats vow to keep pushing GOP to get Trump's tax returns \nTwo constituents of Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey also brought up Trump's tax returns at his town hall. When asked to give a \"yes or no\" answer as to whether he'd support Democrats' effort on Ways and Means to obtain the president's returns, Lance said \"[it] goes too far\" and suggested it would be an \"overreach\" for Congress to examine the returns of a \"private individual.\" \nAmid boos from the crowd in response, the questioner pushed back, \"He's the President! He's not a private individual!\" \nFor his part, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady has said he only believes the law lets the committee review returns when there is a question of whether the tax code is being properly administered. \nThe demands for Trump's tax returns haven't been limited to Republican town halls. Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon, the leading Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, also addressed the issue. \n\"I'm the author of the legislation that would require presidential candidates and presidents to disclose their taxes. And I am committed to making sure the American people get that information,\" Wyden said at a town hall last week. \nHe had called on Trump to release his returns before the election. And he introduced a bill that would compel all presidential nominees and sitting presidents to publicly disclose their three most recent tax returns. If they don't, Wyden's bill would authorize the Treasury to do it for them. So far no action has been taken on his bill.
