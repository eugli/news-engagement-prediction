You’re gonna see them come out now: ‘Obstruct and resist.’ Well, at least I can take credit for it.” \nTrump was talking about the fact that many — if not most — of his Cabinet appointees have been strongly opposed by the Democrats in the Senate. In fact, not since 1789 under President George Washington has a White House administration waited so long to have a full Cabinet, according to The Daily Signal . \nBy early February in 2001, former President George W. Bush had his entire Cabinet in place, Fox News reported , and former President Barack Obama had all but three positions filled by Feb. 8, 2009. \nRoughly half of Trump’s Cabinet nominees have yet to be confirmed, according to CNBC , marking the longest delay for any modern president. \n“It’s just delay, delay, delay — it’s really sad,” the president said during his Friday speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. “I love setting records, but I hate having a Cabinet meeting and I see all these empty seats. I said, ‘Democrats, please, approve our Cabinet.'” \nThese delays, along with the protests and heckling at Republican town halls around the country, have been part of what the Democrats have informally nicknamed, “The Resistance.” Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, the newly-elected chair of the Democratic National Committee, referenced the movement during his acceptance speech for the top DNC post over the weekend, according to RealClearPolitics . \n“Where were you in 2017, when we had the worst president in the history of the United States?” Perez said historians will ask when they look back at Trump’s tenure in the White House. “We will be able to say that the Democratic Party led the resistance, and made sure this was a one-term president.” \nShortly after Perez was elected, Trump took to Twitter to congratulate the new DNC chief. “I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party,” he wrote. \nPerez shot back at the president: “Don’t get too happy. … I, and the Democrats united across the country, will be your worst nightmare.” Trump says he thinks he just gave Democrats a new slogan: “Obstruct & resist” \n“I’m good at branding…at least I can take credit”, he adds. pic.twitter.com/ufJd0Naldg", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T21:53:00.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
