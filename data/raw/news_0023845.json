He was told it was unlikely he’d make it to May, which is around the time his youngest son would officially receive his diploma. But thanks to school administrators, Alfred was able to witness the milestone. CNN reports officials at Long Beach High School in Mississippi conducted an early graduation ceremony specifically for Alfred’s son, Noah. School faculty, friends, and family gathered on the La’Cap’s driveway where the small and emotional ceremony took place. Noah was dressed in his red cap and gown, while “Pomp and Circumstance” played through someone’s cellphone.
