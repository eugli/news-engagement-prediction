Was Obama too soft on Russia?’’\nIn that and a series of other morning tweets Wednesday, Trump appeared to be trying to distance himself from any appearance of close ties with Russia following published reports that U.S. agencies had intercepted phone calls last year between Russian intelligence officials and his 2016 campaign team.\nTrump denounced ‘‘this Russian connection non-sense’’ as ‘‘merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton’s losing campaign.’’\nTrump’s remarks come on the heels of the resignation of his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, after it was revealed that he’d reportedly discussed sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. before Trump was sworn in.\nThe fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017\nThis Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.\n— Donald J.
