The first debate is less than one month away, scheduled for March 12 in Ottawa. \nHowever, there are at least three other people considering joining the race. \nMP Charlie Angus, the 54-year-old MP who represents the northern Ontario riding of Timmins--James Bay, launched a website in January to collect input as he considers a run. \nOntario NDP Deputy Leader Jagmeet Singh, who represents the suburban Toronto riding of Bramalea—Gore—Malton, told CTV’s Your Morning last month that he’s “seriously considering” campaigning for the job. \nSingh, 38, is drawing attention this week south of the border with a new interview in GQ , which calls him an “incredibly well-dressed rising star.” Singh told the magazine he got into politics in part because racism he experienced as a child made him “more sensitive and aware of the struggles people faced when it came to poverty, gender, and other systemic barriers.” \nThere is also a social media campaign to draft Niki Ashton, MP for Manitoba riding Churchill—Keewatinook Aski. \nAshton is also endorsed by the NDP Socialist Caucus. She recently said she was “in no rush” to make a decision.
