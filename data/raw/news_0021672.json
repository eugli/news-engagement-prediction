Tim Tebow (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 4:18 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 4:18 p.m. ET \nSeemingly, for as long as Tim Tebow has been in the national spotlight, there's been a weird fascination with his sex life, or lack thereof. \nIt all started back in 2009. \nTebow was the Heisman-trophy, national-championship winning quarterback at the University of Florida and a bonafide heartthrob.

It's about focusing on the things you are gonna do.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:21:33.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
