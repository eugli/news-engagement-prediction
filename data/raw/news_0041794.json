We are losing our way if we judge all athletes as if they are cheats.\" \nThe Essendon affair is Australia's longest running doping scandal with no clear winners. \nA Supreme Court writ has been lodged in Victoria asserting misleading or deceptive conduct in the handling of the joint ASADA-AFL investigation. \nThe ongoing Australian affair is being watched closely by lawyers, anti-doping officials and sports most senior officials around the globe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:01:01.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
