Winifred Oyo-Ita \nShe said over 23,000 civil servants across the country have been duly registered under the programme. \nAccording to her, ‘’The financial commitments in this arrangements which is currently in the region of N30bn brought us to the realization that we require innovative strategies in financing the FISH project beyond the traditional sources like, the Federal government Staff Housing Loans Board, FGSHLB and the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria, FMBN. The FGBN grant housing loans to public servants at three percent and FMBN grant mortgage at six percent interest rate through primary mortgage institutions to civil servants and other Nigerians who are contributors to the National Housing Funds.’. \nShe added that the FISH programme launched by the Federal Government last year is aimed at reducing the bottlenecks encountered in securing land for good cause projects and most importantly, to eliminate middlemen and land speculations from the housing value-chain.” Okogba ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:11:59.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
