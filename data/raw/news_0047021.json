We are not faceless corporations; we are young cooks working ungodly hours, we are servers putting their kids through school, we are small business owners putting everything we have on the line.” Story continues below \nThe post gained some traction within the city’s restaurant industry, with some saying the number of no-shows is on the rise. The increase is caused, in part, to the ease of booking on sites like OpenTable that give people the anonymity they need to book multiple tables at different restaurants and only show for one. \nSome restaurants are fighting back. \nChambar in Downtown Vancouver now asks for a credit card number when taking a reservation for a party of five or more. If they fail to show up, the card is charged $25. \nChambar’s Edwyn Kumar said they have seen a spike in no-shows over the last year, with anywhere from 20 to 25 per cent of guests failing to show up for a reservation. He said the new policy “solved the problem quite quickly.” \nOf course, charging for no-shows could deter people from making reservations at all, which puts restaurants in a tough situation. By doing nothing, they risk having empty tables during peak times. But they also risk making angering customers, which could also lead to empty tables. \n– With files from Aaron McArthur © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
