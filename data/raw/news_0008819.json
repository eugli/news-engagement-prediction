Lyn, 45, said: 'She wasn't just an employee, I thought she was my friend. 'She started in May 2015 and we have since discovered that within two days of receiving authorisation to make payments on behalf of the business she had stolen £500. 'Most of the payments were between £500 and £1,000, but some were as high as £2,000. The biggest payment was £6,500 that she paid to herself when she was off work for two weeks, because her childminder was on holiday. 'She went on holiday to Ibiza and even logged in to steal £1,000 whilst she was away. I just can't trust anybody now because of what she did. It has been devastating.' Russ and Lyn Blackburn's business was forced into liquidation two weeks ago, with the loss of six jobs Mr Blackburn said he still has no idea if or how the money has been spent, but suspects some of it was spent on designer clothes and the holiday to Spain. He added: 'To be honest I'd rather see the money recovered than a prison sentence. 'We got married in April. We put £1,000 we had been given as gifts into the business to help pay wages. She knew about that money and as soon as it hit the account she took it. 'When we found out about the CCJ she loaned me £1,000, but we later found out she was responsible for the CCJ because she had not paid the bills. And on top of that the money she was lending us was taken from the business in the first place. Akinola even continued to steal money while she was on holiday in Ibiza 'We employed somebody to check over the accounts and all the payments were discovered a month later. 'We called her into the office and she initially denied all knowledge and tried to blame the bank. When she did admit it, I was gobsmacked. 'I personally feel that she sees this as an occupational hazard and that she started out with the intention of stealing from us. 'I just hope now that all the lies and pretence will stop.' The couple, who were supported in court by family and friends, said the impact of the theft had reached far beyond their own family. Mr Blackburn added: 'Suppliers have been owed money and staff have lost jobs. 'But none of us wanted to sit in a court and watch her family suffer. She has three lovely kids and they are going to suffer now too. 'We considered her a friend as well as an employee - it has been a real betrayal.' Magistrates sent the case to Birmingham Crown Court in order for Akinola to face sentencing later this month. Akinola also now faces proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act.
