Possible site \nA spokesman said: \"This is the start of a process to revitalise a site which has been badly in need of regeneration for some time. \n\"We intend to implement the scheme in a way that protects the important heritage of the area by starting with the refurbishment of Garfield Street and the Northern Bank on Waring Street.\" \nThe design team for the scheme include Chapman Taylor, the architects whose schemes include MediaCity in Salford. \nRoyal Exchange has previously been proposed as a possible site for a John Lewis department store. \nHowever, the retailer has only ever expressed an interest in opening a store at the Sprucefield retail park near Lisburn. \nCastlebrooke will hold public consultation events at The Mac Belfast on 14, 27 and 28 February.
