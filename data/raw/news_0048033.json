After other documents emerged and the attribution to Michelangelo was confirmed, there was some discussion about where the statue should go and in what guise. Michelangelo had sculpted a nude Christ because, in 1514, “reverence for classical antiquity and the timeless beauty of the human body” still held sway, Professor Squarzina said. Later, in keeping with the mores of the Counter-Reformation, a bronze cloth was added to cover the Christ’s groin. “The monks didn’t want a nude statue on the main altar, but we wanted to display it as Michelangelo had created it, so we arrived at a compromise,” said Professor Squarzina, who had the backing of the state’s art authorities. The bronze cloth was removed, and the statue was placed in a side chapel where it is protected by alarms and a heavy metal grate. \n  Both versions of the statue will be exhibited at the National Gallery (the Minerva one in a plaster cast), so that they can be studied side-by-side for the first time. “The evolution between the two versions is fascinating and ties into Michelangelo’s relationship with Sebastiano,” the focus of the exhibition, said Matthias Wivel, the National Gallery’s curator of 16th-century Italian paintings. The statues “help us tell this story,” he said. Sebastiano, moreover, was involved in the haphazard installation of the second version of the statue in the Minerva, which he described in panicky letters to Michelangelo. Those letters will also be included in the London show. Father Tuderti says he hopes that the statue’s notoriety will bring more visitors to the monastery, which runs a bed-and-breakfast. Few locals come to the site, he said, perhaps not knowing that there was a Michelangelo to behold. “Viterbo is closed mentally, like their Etruscan forbears, they’re more appreciative of what’s on the table” and in their farms, Father Tuderti said. “I hope they don’t hear me,” he joked. After London, the statue is set to travel to Japan for other exhibitions, he said. Some art experts fear that the statue — which weighs around a ton and has to be transported using military planes — has been traveling more than it should, putting it at risk of damage or loss. But Father Tuderti says that the attribution to Michelangelo has been a godsend, and that the money the monastery makes from lending it for exhibitions has paid off large tax debts and is helping to finance the construction of a monastery in the Republic of Congo. “The statue was identified at the right time,” he said. “We were in financial difficulty, and this statue now brings us a little help every once in a while.” \nFollow Elisabetta Povoledo on Twitter @EPovoledo .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:10:38.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
