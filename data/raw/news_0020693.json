Offences spread across state's south \nCheek's first offence was in 1955 as a scout leader in the Perth suburb of Wembley, when he molested an 11-year-old boy. \nHe then moved to Albany where he indecently dealt with an altar boy in the 1960s. \nCheek worked all around the South West including Lake Grace, Margaret River, Pingelly and Bunbury before he abused two boys in Ravensthorpe in 1975 and 1976.

He was charged by police in 2015. \nBishop of Bunbury Allan Ewing conceded the church had failed to protect the boys, despite becoming aware of rumours of Cheek's inappropriate behaviour 15 years ago. \nThe case comes at a difficult time for the church, after the Anglican Archbishop of Perth Roger Herft temporarily stood aside in October 2016 to focus his attention on the royal commission's inquiry into the Diocese of Newcastle.
