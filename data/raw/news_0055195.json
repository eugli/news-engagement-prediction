Key points: Mexico calls US plan to deport non-Mexicans across their border \"unacceptable\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer says US-Mexico ties \"phenomenal right now\" Trump administration reviewing billions of dollars in aid to Mexico \nOne official called the new US immigration guidelines \"hostile\" hours before senior Trump administration envoys began arriving in Mexico City for talks on the volatile issue. \nThe US Department of Homeland Security unveiled plans on Tuesday to consider almost all illegal immigrants subject to deportation, and will seek to send many of them to Mexico if they entered the United States from there, regardless of nationality. \nThe tension over the timing of the rules mirrors an outcry when President Donald Trump said on Twitter Mexico should pay for his planned border wall shortly before Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was due at a Washington summit in January. \nNevertheless, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said in Washington US-Mexico ties were \"phenomenal right now\" and that he expected a \"great discussion\". \nOther senior officials also put on a brave face, telling reporters the trip was aimed at building a close working relationship. Donald Trump's plan to build a border wall with Mexico raises many questions. \nMr Trump, who took office last month, campaigned on a pledge to get tougher on the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, playing on fears of violent crime while promising to build the wall and stop potential terrorists from entering the country. \nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson landed in Mexico City on Wednesday afternoon. \nHe was joined by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly later for talks the White House said would \"walk through\" the implementation of Trump's immigration orders. \nMr Kelly signed the guidelines issued by his department on Monday. \nMexico's lead negotiator with the Trump administration, Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, said there was no way Mexico would accept the new rules, which among other things seek to deport non-Mexicans to Mexico. \n\"I want to say clearly and emphatically that the Government of Mexico and the Mexican people do not have to accept provisions that one government unilaterally wants to impose on the other,\" Mr Videgaray told reporters at the Foreign Ministry. \nHe said the issue would dominate the talks on Wednesday and Thursday. Mexico will insist that the United States proves the nationality of any person it wants to deport to Mexico, he said. \n\"We also have control of our borders and we will exercise it fully,\" he said, adding that Mexico was prepared to go the United Nations to defend the freedoms and rights of Mexicans under international law. Mexico deportation plan 'unacceptable' \nRoberto Campa, who heads the human rights department of the Interior Ministry, said the plan to deport non-Mexicans to Mexico was \"hostile\" and \"unacceptable.\" \nSenators for the leading leftist opposition party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution, said Mr Tillerson and Mr Kelly were not welcome in Mexico and they urged Mr Pena Nieto not to meet them. \nAnother potential point of friction is a review ordered by Trump of the US aid Mexico receives, dominated by $2.6 billion allocated largely for security under the Merida Initiative. Some believe the order carries a threat of cutting off such support. \nHomeland Security's guidance to immigration agents is part of a broader border security and immigration enforcement plan in executive orders that Trump signed on January 25. \nIn Guatemala on Wednesday, Kelly denied the administration was embarking on mass deportations. \nJason Marczak, director of the Atlantic Council's Latin America Economic Growth Initiative, said the Republican President appeared to have timed the unveiling of deportation measures as a negotiating tactic aimed at unsettling Mexico. \nMr Trump was \"carving out more extreme positions to be able to then negotiate a compromise solution,\" Mr Marczak said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:50:30.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
