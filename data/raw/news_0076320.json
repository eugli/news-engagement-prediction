(Photo: Michael Thomas/Getty Images) Related \nIn the latest development in a rash of anti-Semitic threats and vandalism across the country, vandals have desecrated the Mount Carmel Cemetery on Frankford Avenue in Wissinoming, which is in Northeast Philadelphia. \nHundreds of headstones were damaged or toppled. The damage was discovered Sunday morning. \nAaron Mallin made the discovery when he arrived to visit his father’s resting place. He told 6ABC News how he felt about finding the aftermath. \n>> Read more trending news \n“It’s very disheartening that such a thing would take place. I’m hoping it was maybe just some drunk kids, but the fact that there’s so many, it leads one to think it could have been targeted,” Mallin said. \nAs the investigation is just beginning, Philadelphia police are calling it an act of vandalism. Hundreds of graves could be affected; the cemetery is still tallying the damages. \nThe Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia has said they will begin raising money to speed the repair and reconditioning of the affected graves. \nThere are no comments yet.
