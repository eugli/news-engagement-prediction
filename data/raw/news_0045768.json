DCLG Land identified in 2015 to be sold off by Government departments \nFigures released by the Government today show that so far land with the capacity for 1,534 homes has been sold by the MOD. \nThe Ministry of Justice, which pledged to free up land for 5,000 homes, did not sell any land for housing last year at all. DCLG \nToday’s report claims land with the capacity for 131,675 homes has been identified but not yet sold. \nYet together with the 13,817 already sold off, that still leaves the Government 14,508 houses short of its target. DCLG \nWhen it comes to delivering the sell off by 2020, analysis by the Government shows that land for 55,410 houses - 42% of the total amount - is categorised as “high risk... one or more issues prevent exchange of contracts before 31 March 2020 which is/are very unlikely to be resolved.” DCLG \nThe Government’s white paper on housing, released earlier this month, was criticised for not going far enough to tackle the crisis facing those wishing to get on the property ladder. \nIn the document, the Tories dropped a flagship pledge to build 200,000 discount homes for first-time buyers by 2020. \nInstead, they will aim to create 200,000 new homeowners through a broader range of measures, including loan guarantee schemes and opportunities to share ownership. \nThe Department for Communities and Local Government has been approached for a comment.
