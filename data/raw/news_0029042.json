Trends Russia-NATO relations \nThe six Leopard 2e tanks, which will be deployed outside Spain for the first time, will be accompanied by between 14 and 16 armored vehicles, the embassy said according to Latvian information agency LETA. \nThe stated objective of the mission is to strengthen Latvian security and reinforce NATO’s presence on its eastern flank. The Spanish armored vehicles will first be showcased during the military drills to take place on Latvian soil this May, according to local media. \nLatvian Defense Ministry spokesman, Kaspars Galkins, however, said talks are still underway with NATO states on what specific equipment they will station in the country. \n“Several countries participating in the battalion have announced what kind of equipment they intend to deploy to Latvia. Consultations continue with these countries, and no specifics regarding the type of military equipment and the precise number of units has been determined,” Galkins said.

Europe threat to Russian security, increases risk of incidents – Moscow \nWhile NATO members continue to point to the perceived “Russian aggression,” calling it “a source of instability,” Russia has consistently denied the allegations. Moscow also criticized the NATO military buildup on its borders, saying it increases the risk of incidents and poses a threat to Russian national security. \n“This deployment is, of course, a threat for us,” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksey Meshkov said last week, adding that “it is obvious that the steps by NATO gravely increase the risk of incidents.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:35:56.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
