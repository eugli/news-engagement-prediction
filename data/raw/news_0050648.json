It takes a lot of skills to make people laugh. There are several actors who have always made us burst into hysterics with their performances on the big screen, but unfortunately, they didn’t get all the limelight they deserved. Here is a list of the comedy actors who we think deserve more recognition in the industry than they have received. Saurabh Shukla \nscoopwhoop.com \nSaurabh Shukla has pushed us into laughing zones with his comic timing in several films including Dasvidaniya , Jolly LLB , PK and Barfi amongst others. There was a time when he didn’t get any roles for almost six years after Satya . Now, he has a National Award for J olly LLB in his kitty, but we think he needs more recognition for his amazing talent. “Throughout my career, I’ve had people telling me that I’m a good actor but the awards always eluded me. And then to get this one — given by the government of India — is a great feeling,” he told Indian Express after winning the national award. Govardhan Asrani \nwikimedia.org \nGovardhan Asrani, fondly called Asrani, is remembered for his role as a hilarious jailor in Sholay . He is also remembered for his comic timing in films including Khatta Meetha, De Dana Dan and All The Best amongst others. His recent works include web series Permanent Roommates and film Mastizaade . Asrani said that he never wanted to feature in the adult-comedy movie. “Mujhe mastizaade main kaam karna pada, mujhe sharam aayi (I had to work in Mastizaade, I felt embarrassed)”, he told HT City. Deepak Dobriyal \nindia.com \nApart from Kangana Ranaut and R. Madhavan’s stellar performances in Tanu Weds Manu , if there was another actor who made us laugh in almost all the frames he was present in, it was Deepak Dobriyal. We think he deserves many more awards for his portrayal of Pappi Ji in the movie. Vijay Raj \nindianexpress.com \nIf you have watched Abhishek Bachchan and Bhumika Chawla starer Run , you would for sure remember Vijay Raj whose 'Kauwa Biryani' act made him popular among the audience. The actor is also known for his roles as PK Dubey in Monsoon Wedding and Delhi Belly . He was last seen in a cameo role in Dishoom .
