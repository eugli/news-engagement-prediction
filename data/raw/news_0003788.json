Former Oakland Mayor Jean Quan on Tuesday joined others in urging lawmakers to approve a proposed bill to prohibit local law enforcement from using resources to enforce federal immigration laws at a state Senate Public Safety Committee hearing. (Rich Pedroncelli / Associated Press) Jazmine Ulloa meant to strengthen protections for immigrants and religious minorities in California.\nIn public safety and judiciary committee hearings, lawmakers advanced bills that would protect immigrants’ personal information, provide them lawyers and prevent local law enforcement agencies from using resources to enforce federal immigration laws. \nThe debate over the proposals at the state Capitol came days after protests erupted at airports across the country over Trump’s executive orders, which pledged to cut funding from so-called sanctuary cities and barred refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. \nBefore lawmakers and at a news conference filled with advocates from across the state, immigrants shared their personal stories of crossing borders and of entanglement with an unwieldy federal immigration system that they said broke apart their families. Democratic legislators stressed what they said was a necessity for the state to act as a bulwark against what they called Trump’s “vitriolic” rhetoric and harmful policies toward immigrant communities. \nBut the day also gave a glimpse into the challenges ahead for Democratic lawmakers hoping to reach across the aisle for support, reflecting a national partisan rift over issues of immigration reform, national security and public safety. \nSpeaking in favor of one the immigration bills, Sen. Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley), chairwoman of the Senate Public Safety Committee, called the divide a “very false dichotomy” because she said Democrats and Republicans share a commitment to public safety and national security. \n“All of us want hardened criminals prosecuted under the law,” she said. “All of us. But what we are watching now is a pitting of people against each other, a targeting of immigrants.” \nCalifornia ranks among the states with the highest immigrant populations and had the greatest number of unauthorized immigrants in the country in 2014, about 2.3 million, according to the latest data available from the Pew Research Center. \nOf the bills presented Tuesday, the one with most wide-reaching impact on the immigrant community is a proposal by Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles), which would prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from using resources to investigate, detain, report or arrest people to help enforce federal immigration laws. \nThe proposal, dubbed the California Values Act, also aims to protect immigrants’ personal data, requiring state agencies to update their confidentiality policies and to ensure that they are only collecting information necessary to their departments. \nBefore Skinner’s committee, De León said the legislation was meant to ensure trust between residents and police and to prevent mass deportations. Trump’s executive orders last week confirmed his “worst fears,” he said, creating a dragnet that would sweep up criminals and hardworking families alike. \nSupporters of the bill said police need immigrants to come forward as victims and witnesses to help solve crimes. And they stressed that many police chiefs do not want to enforce immigration laws. \nBut opponents were not swayed. They said the proposal’s language was too broad and could prevent communication among police agencies at different levels of government, allowing dangerous criminals to escape prosecution. \n“I’m concerned that you are basically making the state of California a de facto sanctuary state,” Sen. Jeff Stone (R-Murrieta) told De León. \nAnother bill introduced by state Sen. Ben Hueso (D-San Diego), which was presented Tuesday to the Senate Judiciary Committee, would create a state-funded legal defense program for immigrants facing deportation or removal proceedings. \nLawmakers raised concerns about whether it whittled away at defense services available for detainees convicted of certain crimes — and over how the state would be able to afford such a system amid a looming deficit and budget cuts from the federal government. \nBut both bills ultimately passed their respective committees with 5-2 votes. The only proposal to pass unanimously and with bipartisan support was legislation introduced by Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) that attempts to block the creation of a “Muslim registry,” another Trump proposal, through prohibiting state and local agencies from providing or disclosing religious affiliation information to the federal government. \nSen. Joel Anderson (R-San Diego), who voted against De León’s bill, requested to serve as coauthor of Lara’s bill. \nPresenting his bill before the judiciary committee, Lara said floor debates on Monday over Trump’s ban on refugees “reiterated not only to me — but to the country — that this is an important fight against injustice at every level.” \nCalifornia's new legislative session begins with a message: We're ready to fight Trump » Caption Trump nominates Neil Gorsuch for Supreme Court \nPresident Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M.
