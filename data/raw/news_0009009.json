The group says on its website that several of its hunters have witnessed it with their own eyes, and describes the southern Bigfoot as a fast animal that can be 'white, brown, black, reddish brown, brownish black, tan, gray, khaki' or 'black with gray streaks'.\nThe show's first season sees the team traveling around the country to protect families who believe they are being tormented by Bigfoot, and aiming to kill one of the animals so as to prove its existence.\nScroll down for video\nThe Gulf Coast Bigfoot Research Organization (pictured) is a team of Bigfoot hunters who have made it their mission to travel across America and protect residents against the creature\nGCBRO members, which include former cops, National Guard and military veterans, a medical technician and a coroner's employee, use night-vision equipment, microphones and thermal imaging to try to capture traces of the animal.\nDuring the first episode of ' Killing Bigfoot ', three members of the group attend the Honobia Bigfoot Conference in Oklahoma and are confronted to those who believe the creature shouldn't be hunted, but left alone.\nThe next episode features a neuro-psychologist and no-kill advocate, who would like the GCBRO to forsake guns and insteadattract a Sasquatch by playing the flute playing and offering it food.\n'We have the no-kill side that want to string us up and tell us (they) hope we shoot each other,' GCBRO investigator Don McDonald, of Brandon, Mississippi, told the Clarion-Ledger .

It was a nice, peaceful encounter and there is no way in the world I would shoot that animal,' he told the newspaper.\nThe show follows the GCBRO to Louisiana, where residents report seeing a small creature comparable to an orangutan and hearing monkey sounds near the woods.\nGCBRO investigator Don McDonald (pictured) said some Bigfoots were 'mean'\nGCBRO members will also go to east Texas, where a woman named Anna claims she shot a Sasquatch in her backyard. Another episode will focus on the Mississippi area.\n'We don't go to an area unless we know the creatures are there, because we get a lot of false reports,' McDonald told the Clarion-Ledger.\n'We look for tree limbs that have been tipped instead of cracked.\n'If you're walking through the woods and try to be quiet, you are going to tip that branch so you will be stealthy next time through.'\nBigfoot, however, is hard to catch on camera according to McDonald, who offered an explanation.\n'We believe they see in an infrared spectrum, which most of your trail cameras use to set off their trigger mechanism,' he said.\n' Killing Bigfoot ' will premiere Saturday on Destination America, with the six-episode season lasting until March 11.\nDuring the first episode of the show, members of the group are confronted to those who believe the creature shouldn't be hunted, but left alone\nThe next episode features a no-kill advocate who would like the GCBRO (pictured) to forsake guns and insteadattract a Sasquatch by playing the flute playing and offering it food", "external_links": ["http://www.clarionledger.com/story/magnolia/entertainment/2017/02/02/alleged-bigfoot-sighting-near-pascagoula-hit-tv/97306748/", "http://www.killingbigfoot.com/", "http://www.destinationamerica.com/tv-shows/killing-bigfoot/killing-bigfoot-on-destination-america/", "http://gcbro.com/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-04T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:26:23.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
