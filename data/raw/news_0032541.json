The attacks took on a key infrastructure of the dark web called Freedom Hosting 2 last weekend\nWHO ARE ANONYMOUS? Anonymous is a loosely associated international network of activist and hacktivist entities.\nA website associated with the group describes it as 'an internet gathering' with 'a very loose and decentralised command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives.'\nThe group has become known for its hack attacks on government websites, extremist groups and corporate websites.\nThe attacks took on a key infrastructure of the dark web called Freedom Hosting 2 over the past weekend.\nThe component hosts 20 per cent of dark web sites and claims to have a 'zero tolerance policy to child pornography'.\nEach website that the hacker took down was left with a message of warning.\n'We are disappointed,' the message reads.\n'We found while searching that your server is more than 50 per cent child porn.\n'Moreover you host many scam sites, some of which are evidently run by yourself to cover hosting expenses.'\nWhen the hacker found ten child pornography sites hosted on Freedom Hosting 2 they decided to shut down the whole network.\nThe hacker then leaked information from the sites, which the vigilante claims contained child pornography images and personal data that was for sale.\nInformation leaked includes all of the websites' system files and account information from their databases, which the hacker made available as a free download.\nWhen the hacker found 10 child pornography sites hosted on Freedom Hosting 2 they decided to shut down the whole network. The hacker then leaked information from the sites (stock image)\nUser data from the websites reportedly contained thousands of unverified US government email addresses.\nTwitter account @YourAnonNews, which boasts almost 1.7 million followers and is widely believed to be Anonymous's primary social media account, has denied responsibility.\n'Since it has come up more than once, this account is not taking credit for this,' the account wrote in reply to a tweet from another user crediting Anonymous with the hack.\n'Let credit go where it's due if it's so desired.'\nTwitter account @YourAnonNews, which boasts almost 1.7 million followers and is widely believed to be Anonymous's primary social media account, has denied responsibility\nBut Anonymous has previously tackled dark web sites hosting child pornography.\nThe group targeted the original Freedom Hosting service in 2011 as part of 'Operation Dark Net', an attack on internet child pornography.\n'Operation Death Eaters' in 2014 involved members of the group targeting paedophilia rings.\nThe group has attacked Islamic State and the Ku Klux Klan in recent years.\nAnonymous is a loosely associated international network of activist and hacktivist entities.\nA website associated with the group describes it as 'an Internet gathering' with 'a very loose and decentralised command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives.'\nThe group has become known for its hack attacks on government websites, extremist groups, and corporate websites.\nThe hackers responsible for last weekend's attack are yet to respond to MailOnline's request for comment.\nWHAT IS THE DARK WEB'S TOR BROWSER? Tor - short for The Onion Router - is a seething matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday internet with complete anonymity.\nIt uses numerous layers of security and encryption to render users anonymous online.\nNormally, file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user's unique IP address that can be traced back to an individual computer.\nThe Tor network hides the IP address and the activity of the user.\nMost of the Web's information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines - sites or pages don't exist until created as the result of a specific search.\nAn Internet search is like dragging a net across the surface of the sea - a great deal of information is caught, but a majority is deep and therefore missed.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-08T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:37:49.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
