The two things don’t necessarily follow – Guns ’n’ Roses, another 90s act helmed by a ginger-haired icon, has also resonated with a lot of people across Australia this week, but that hasn’t made them any more sophisticated.\nBy contrast, since their days of being excluded by Sinodinos’ old boss John Howard, Hanson’s party has aged like the finest wine – white, of course. \nCoalition threatens to raise taxes if savings are not passed – politics live Read more \nThe party is like a box of fine cigars, enjoyed by only a discerning few (less than 5% at the last election), while others reject them on the grounds of health and taste.\nObserving its senators in action, one could be forgiven for mistaking them for a string quartet, albeit one whose cellist had abandoned the group mid-recital to play a peculiar étude of his own devising before being thrown out of the concert hall.\nAnd what could be more sophisticated than Pauline Hanson’s view of this country as an exclusive member’s club – our very own Australia-a-Lago? If she had her way, we’d have a strict door policy and a dress code of flag-capes .\nSo when the WA Liberals are looking for an election partner, Pauline Hanson isn’t just the rightmost choice, she’s the right choice.\nIn 2017, One Nation is so much more than just its founder – or indeed James Ashby. Its other senators are creatures of – well, perhaps not quite high society, but certainly the Q Society.\nHer party has grown in stature from when it was a one-person show – that person being David Oldfield. Nowadays, she has a band of trusty sidekicks as powerful and unpredictable as Tripitaka’s .\nHanson once famously asked “please explain”, but now she has the explanatory force that is Malcolm Roberts, who can discredit global warming in such a way that even Professor Brian Cox was left gasping with what one can only presume was awe.\nBack when she first railing started against Asians, One Nation felt un peu déclassé . They seemed to be arguing for a return to the white Australia policy instead of maintaining our system of unofficial, subtle exclusions.\nBut Hanson’s newer approach of railing against Muslims isn’t technically racist – Islam being a religion, albeit one that’s overwhelmingly followed by non-whites. What’s more, rather than simply calling for a ban, Hanson first wants a royal commission into whether Islam is a religion. \nIslam may well be a giant book club, or Saudi Arabia’s equivalent of Rotary – there’s no harm in asking the question, is there? At least if you aren’t Muslim.\nWhat’s more, the party’s fiery rhetoric now comes accompanied by compelling examples. On its website , we learn that Cadbury, the “Australian icon” from Britain, sought halal approval for Easter eggs even though it’s a Christian festival. Why would Cadbury do that when we all know that chocolate eggs are a sophisticated treat to be enjoyed by Christians only?\nOn climate change, the party argues that “Paying a carbon tax or an Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is not going to wave a magic wand and stop nature changing the climate change”, a claim so important that it’s written in bold text . Who, then, will stop nature changing the climate change? Well, not One Nation, but they certainly want to stop us from trying to stop it.\nOnce a fringe party, One Nation remains a fringe party today, but one whose insularity is shared across the world. Their flag-draped nationalism, instinctive protectionism and demand for a huge drop in tax revenues are shared by none other than the President of the United States, an actual billionaire (we think) who boasts many gold accessories, and also just boasts.\nBut even beyond the impressive manner in which Pauline Hanson’s league has emerged from its slumber like a butterfly that refuses to touch halal-certified nectar, it feels appropriate for the Liberals to partner with her party.\nThis reinvigorated One Nation 2.0 is the creation of Malcolm Turnbull’s party – and the Nationals, ironically. Without the PM’s double disillusion, the party would have won only Hanson’s seat, according to Antony Green . \nMalcolm Roberts would have been just another crank writing Julia Gillard weird colon-studded letters about his soul. Brian Burston would never have devoted his maiden speech to demanding that the ABC make way for the Patriotic Broadcasting Corporation, that most North Korean-sounding of public broadcasters, which would presumably perform its task with the balletic grace of Kim Jong-Un offing an uncle.\nAustralians are worried about Trump. But there's a lot to be worried about at home | Jason Wilson Read more \nAnd poor Rod Culleton would never have been a senator, long before the high court ruled that he wasn’t.\nThe WA Liberals are in no position to refuse One Nation on principle. John Howard did so from a position of electoral strength, whereas the last time Malcolm Turnbull tried to draw a moral line in the sand on the carbon pollution reduction scheme, he found himself on the other side of it, watching Tony Abbott getting sworn in as PM. Pragmatism demands a deal with Hanson, unless of course you agree with Glenn Druery that it’ll make voters back Labor all the more .\nArthur Sinodinos is right that One Nation isn’t the party it was 20 years ago. None of us are who we were in the 1990s. Back then, I had hair on my head, and he didn’t have any issues with Icac. The main difference between the One Nation of then and now isn’t so much its sophistication as the fact that it’s undeniably a player, at least until the 2019 election.\nPower is ultimately what counts in politics. Principles are an indulgence for minor parties that are in no danger of forming government. And that’s why all that matters is that One Nation might help the WA Liberals win, even if they lose themselves in the process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:24:35.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
