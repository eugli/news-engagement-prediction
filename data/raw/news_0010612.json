Why can't we say that? \n\"Because I sort of feel like with the silence and the not talking about it enables it to keep happening. \n\"I feel like with my show and talking about it I'm saying, 'don't let this happen to you, and it can happen to you'.\" Subject matter still raw Photo: Geelong man Daniel O'Keeffe went missing in 2011 before taking his own life. (Supplied: Dan Come Home) \nThe play invites the audience to become a part of a loving, close-knit family of four kids and two doting parents. \nDay-to-day anecdotes and family celebrations are shared on stage, including mother Lori's speech at Mr O'Keeffe's 21st birthday. \n\"He's always been very well behaved, very caring and a very nice person, and I'm so proud of the lovely, handsome young man he's grown up to be,\" she is heard saying. \nMs O'Keeffe said the play's subject matter is still raw. \n\"We'll never know if something triggered it for Dan or if he had been depressed for a lot longer than we knew of,\" she said. \n\"We'll never know exactly what the reason was, but I think there can actually be no trigger — it can just be an illness and a consequence of the illness is suicide.\" \nBut she is hoping the play will help develop the conversation. \n\"There's so many taboos that are discussed in my show — the taboo of mental illness and depression, the taboo of missing-ness, the taboo of suicide, the taboo of death. \n\"All things that we are afraid to talk about and I can't talk about it in everyday life because people are feeling awkward about it. \n\"I feel like theatre is where I can talk about it.\" \nIf you or anyone you know needs help, you can call Lifeline on 13 11 14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:43:51.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
