He struggles to keep his weight down, he gets really tired, then goes partying, drinks a lot and over eats. \n“He gets into this cycle of depression. The reality TV star was formerly known for his indulgent and excessive lifestyle (Photo: MAGICMOMENTSUK) (Photo: Rex Features) \n“He doesn’t want to keep leaning on other people - he wants to sort things out for himself, so he’s getting the best possible help right now.” \nJames has been noticeably absent from filming of the current series of TOWIE - with rumours already circulating that he has taken time out to “get stronger.” \nThe new series returns on March 5th with some new cast and a longer run. \nShow producers are keeping the door open for him to return when he feels ready. \nHe was also absent from the final episodes of the last series, and missed the reality show’s Christmas specials. \nThe Essex star was kicked off TOWIE in December 2014 - amid rumours of drug and alcohol abuse. James 'Arg' Argent is currently in the Far East, where he's focusing on his health \nIt was claimed bosses had grown tired of his poor timekeeping - and he was suspended for repeatedly not showing up for filming. \nHe spent his 27th birthday, and Christmas Day, in December at The Priory - a favourite rehab facility for celebrities. \nHe lost a stone and a half during his stint. \nIn February 2015, he recalled: “Underneath everything I was badly depressed. I was anxious and tired.” \nHe told how he’d stopped answering the door to loved ones and didn’t care anymore. \nHe also admitted: “My dad drove me.

I didn’t want my dad to see me cry but as soon as he left I just sober because I knew I had done this to myself.” \nHe also blamed depression for ruining his on-off relationship to longterm love Lydia Bright - who is currently starring in Channel 4 series The Jump. \nHe split from Lydia last May after she allegedly caught him taking cocaine. \nDuring TOWIE filming in Marbella last September the pair briefly reunited for a fling. \nBut another ex - Gemma Collins - is also set to reveal that she too bedded him during the new series.
