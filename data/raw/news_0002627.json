If you'd like to learn more... - \nA manhunt is underway near Grand Forks, North Dakota for a suspect who allegedly led officers on a high-speed chase, shot at police and stole a vehicle with a baby inside. \nThe suspect is 23-year-old Daniel Michael TwoHearts, police said. \nIt all started Thursday night around 9:30 when the North Dakota Highway Patrol tried to pull over a red Chevrolet truck with an excessively loud exhaust on highway I-29 at Grand Forks. \nThe vehicle fled southbound. \nThat’s when the suspect pulled out a gun and fired three shots at the trooper, according to the North Dakota Highway Patrol. \nThe officer wasn’t hit. \nThe suspect then fled on foot and two passengers in the truck were taken into custody. Methamphetamine was found inside the vehicle, police said. \nWhile officers were searching for the suspect, they received a call of a carjacking in Hillsboro with a baby in the vehicle just after 11 p.m. \nPolice spotted the vehicle near Reynolds, ND and put out tire spikes again, flattening the tires of the vehicle. \nThe suspect fled on foot again and the baby was found in the vehicle safe and uninjured. \nNumerous law enforcement agencies are continuing to look for the suspect Friday. \nTwoHearts is at large and considered armed and dangerous. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
