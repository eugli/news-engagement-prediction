(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) comments \nSpeculation has turned real. \nPete Rose is officially on the 2017 Phillies Wall of Fame ballot and eligible for induction in August --if enough votes are secured. The team sent out the following press release about this year's ballot. Fans can select their top three choices to become a Phillies Wall of Famer from a 10-man ballot of Phillies alumni. A first place vote is worth five points, second place three points and third place one point. The top five fan consensus choices as determined by total points will serve as the official ballot for a special Wall of Fame Selection Committee that will choose this year's inductee. \nOne inductee will be selected from the following group of ex-Phillies: \n-Steve Bedrosian, RHP, 1986-89 \n-Placido Polanco, INF, 2002-05, 2010-12 \n-Ron Reed, RHP, 1976-83 \n-Manny Trillo, 2B, 1979-82 \n-Rick Wise, RHP, 1964; 1966-71 \nThis year's inductee will be the 39 th Phillies great to receive the honor, dating back to the start of the tradition in 1978. The ceremony, dubbed 'Wall of Fame Night' will take place on Sat. August 12 prior to that evening's 7:05 game vs. the Mets . \nWhy Rose belongs on Wall \nRose's case for enshrinement is strong, giving him a great chance to beat out a more productive (but far less popular Phillies player) Scott Rolen. \nOnly five of Rose's 24 years as a player came in Philadelphia, but the hit machine made his impact felt. Four National League All-Star team nods, two top-15 MVP finishes, a Silver Slugger award, .326 postseason batting average and the ability to play 1B, 3B, 2B, RF and LF made Rose a highly valuable piece of a two-time pennant winner during his stay. \nYou can vote for the Wall of Fame inductee here . \nJoe Giglio may be reached at .
