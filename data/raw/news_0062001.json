Shutterstock / Philip Pilosian \nA budget airline has launched bargain flights from the UK to New York costing just £69. \nLow-cost carrier Norwegian Air is offering passengers in Britain cheap rates to fly direct to three destinations on the US when it starts the new routes from June this year. \nAlthough the routes do not run from London , the special-price flights will be available from Edinburgh airport as well as Belfast, Cork, Shannon and Dublin from as little as £69 one-way. \nFlights from the USA to the UK are even cheaper with journeys starting at just £52 for the first 10,000 seats.

Flights with a stop-off are available from £300 and above. \nThe routes go to three US airports - Stewart International Airport around 70 miles north of New York, Providence Airport in Rhode Island near to Boston, and Bradley International Airport in Connecticut. \nPassengers will be able to fly direct from Edinburgh two times a day from June 15 while flights from Dublin, Cork and Shannon in Ireland and Belfast in Northern Ireland will all start running from July 1. \nThe cheaper fares are offered thanks to the type of plane used, a Boeing 737MAX aircraft which burns less fuel than other long-haul aeroplanes, and the smaller airports where the planes land.
