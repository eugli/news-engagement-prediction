Should Australia make any changes? And what of the pitches? February 26, 2017 4:12pm by Joe Barton Source: FOX SPORTS AUSTRALIA threw a cat among the pigeons with their shock first-Test victory in Pune, but the stunning result has thrown up as many questions as it has answers. \nAhead of the second Test in Bangalore starting on Saturday, we look at what impact the win will have on the rest of the series, whether Australia can maintain their form, what Steve O’Keefe is capable of in the next three Tests and what a series victory would mean for coach Darren Lehmann. \nCAN AUSTRALIA WIN THE SERIES NOW? \nHonestly, pre-tour this looked like an absolute impossibility. \nNow, it’s a distinctly on the cards. \nOn all four occasions that Australia have claimed a series victory in India — and it’s only happened four times — they’ve won the opening Test. \nAny other result in Pune than an Australian victory and the mountain doubtless would’ve been too hard to climb. \nBut with a 1-0 series lead and the wind in their sails, anything is possible for Australia — especially if Steve Smith can continue to pile on the runs. Smith puts 100 past India 0:38 \nSHOULD AUSTRALIA MAKE ANY CHANGES? \nHow do you possibly justify making changes to a team which produced such a historic victory? \nClearly Shaun Marsh is under serious pressure to make some runs and extend his career beyond this series, and it could be argued his brother Mitch is also fighting to maintain the all-rounder spot. \nNeither brother made significant contributions to the 333-run win and the likes of Glenn Maxwell and Usman Khawaja are waiting in the wings for an opportunity, while Ashton Agar and Mitchell Swepson would doubtless love an opportunity to join the spin crew. \nThere’s little doubt Khawaja has presented a strong case for inclusion, based purely on his high-achieving summer which delivered 581 runs at 58.1 — but stability is hugely important on tours and it would be madness to unsettle the squad after a morale-boosting win. \nThat’s why the smart money would be on no changes. \nWHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT FROM THE PITCHES? \nAs David Bowie might say: ch-ch-changes. \nThe chances of India turning out a Bunsen burner like we saw in Pune are currently hovering somewhere between slim and zero. \nThe Pune curator has come under fire from current and former Indian players for preparing a wicket which offered turn from the opening overs. \nWhile it was viewed as a tactic designed to exploit perceived Australian weaknesses against spin — and aid Sri Lanka’s spin kings Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja — the plan backfired spectacularly. \nNathan Lyon, who snared five scalps, and in particular Steve O’Keefe, whose 12 wickets earned him man-of-the-match honours, were the heroes while India’s spinners often found the ball spinning too far. \nMore than likely we’ll now see the sort of flatter wickets which England encountered during their 4-0 series defeat recently. O'keefe's three wicket over 2:02 \nCAN O’KEEFE SUPERSEDE LYON AS AUSTRALIA’S NO.1 SPINNER? \nHistory would suggest that this was a historic outlier for O’Keefe which will never be repeated. \nThe likeable left-armer has an excellent first-class record, averaging 23.81 in first class cricket — and still his efforts in Pune were career-best at any professional level. \nO’Keefe had two ten-wicket match hauls from 66 first class matches prior to his Pune perfection. \nBut he’s rarely looked more dangerous, and Lyon’s spot in the team is seemingly never truly secure. \nOn that basis alone, O’Keefe could make a genuine run for a key Ashes role should he continue to outperform Lyon on this tour. \nFormer England spinner Monty Panesar believes O’Keefe is capable of repeating his success on this tour. \n“I think at the moment that they’re not picking his length, because of the drift and they’re committing a bit early in their footwork,” Panesar told foxsports.com.au. \n“Once the ball drifts, they’ve already committed. And by the time they’ve committed their footwork, the ball is landing further than where they think its landing. \n“Then he gets the ball to skid on, because he’s undercutting it, or he gets the one to turn as well. Australian head coach Darren Lehmann would love an Indian series win on his resume. Source: AFP \nWHAT WOULD A SERIES WIN MEAN FOR DARREN LEHMANN AS COACH? \nVictory in India would be one of the more unbelievable triumphs involving Australian cricket and would cement Darren Lehmann’s place as one of the elite coaches in the country’s history. \nAlready on Lehmann’s resume is the 5-0 Ashes whitewash on home soil as well as the 2015 World Cup triumph. \nSuccess has been harder to come by overseas, but masterminding the most remarkable of upsets would make sure his coaching tenure is remembered in a favourable light. \nLehmann is contracted until the 2019 Ashes in England, after which point he is expected to step down with Justin Langer the favourite to take over.
