Highlight of the day \nPunctuating an increasingly fractious relationship with the press, which he has labeled “the enemy of the American people,” Trump pulled out of the annual dinner with Washington reporters that the president typically headlines. I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 \nThe last president to skip the long-standing D.C. tradition was President Ronald Reagan in 1981 — but that was because he was recovering from an assassination attempt, and even then he still managed to phone in his remarks . \nReuters reporter Jeff Mason, the president of the White House Correspondents Association, confirmed in a written statement that the April dinner will go on as planned. \n“We look forward to shining a spotlight at the dinner on some of the best political journalism of the past year and recognizing the promising students who represent the next generation of our profession,” Mason said. Flashback \nTrump was famously lampooned at the 2011 correspondents dinner while in attendance. As then-President Barack Obama mocked the New York real estate mogul for his role in spreading false rumors about Obama’s birthplace and belittled his reality show, “The Celebrity Apprentice,” Trump sat stone-faced in the audience. President Barack Obama pumps his fist as he walks to the rostrum during the White House Correspondents Association Dinner in Washington, Saturday, April 30, 2011.

Alex Brandon/AP \nThe humiliating episode has since been characterized as part of the impetus for Trump’s own presidential campaign, one of many factors that spurred Trump to fight back against the Washington “establishment” in an effort to gain stature. Dissenting voices \nIn an at-times contentious meeting Saturday in Atlanta, the Democratic National Committee voted for former Labor Secretary Tom Perez as the party’s new chairman over Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison . \nPerez’s first move as the new chairman was to tap Ellison as deputy chairman, a clear attempt to unite the party, which had split along similar lines as the presidential primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders . \nIn his victory speech, Perez promised to lead the fight against Trump and change the DNC's culture to make it a more grassroots operation. \n\"We are one family, and I know we will leave here united today,\" Perez said. \"A united Democratic Party is not only our best hope, it is Donald Trump 's nightmare.\" Tweeter in chief \nA few minutes after his correspondents dinner announcement, Trump trolled Perez: Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 \nPerez shot back: Call me Tom. And don't get too happy. @keithellison and I, and Democrats united across the country, will be your worst nightmare. https://t.co/fu7WvLofrD — Tom Perez (@TomPerez) February 25, 2017 \nEarlier in the day, Trump appeared to respond to a Fox News segment in which Herman Cain lamented that the media was not sufficiently covering the fact that the national debt had decreased in his first month in office. \nDavid Bernstein, a writer for Boston Magazine , predicted the development as he watched Cain on TV, warning that if Trump were to tweet about it, “you know where he got it.” Just scrolling through my feed and @dbernstein predicted the future today. pic.twitter.com/NG4DsQRw2T \nBut as New York Times economics reporter Binyamin Appelbaum explained , the statistic has little to do with anything the president has done: \n“The numbers are broadly accurate, but the lack of attention to them is for good reason: Neither president bore responsibility for changes in the federal debt in his opening month in the White House. The slight decline cited by Mr. Trump — a drop of 0.06 percent, according to Treasury data — is a temporary fluctuation, not a change in direction.” Trump longreads \nNew Yorker writers Evan Osnos, David Remnick and Joshua Yaffa took a deep dive into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and the relationship between the administrations of Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.
