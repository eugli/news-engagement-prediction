Ford was reportedly out flying and was instructed by air-traffic controllers at the John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, to land his private plane on the runway upon the completion of his route, but Ford mistakenly landed on a taxiway dangerously close to a full American Airlines passenger plane instead. An air-traffic control recording then captured Ford saying: “Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?” As it’s a violation for a plane to land on a taxiway, NBC notes, the incident has prompted an Federal Aviation Administration investigation. The FAA also confirmed that controllers at the airport gave Ford the proper landing instructions, which he read back to them correctly. If found to be at fault, Ford’s pilot’s license could potentially be suspended. This isn’t the first time Ford’s aviation mishaps have made headlines — among several other instances, in 2015 he crash-landed one of his vintage planes on a Santa Monica golf course after its engine failed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:07:51.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
