Jon Larsen/Project Stardust By Avery Thompson Feb 1, 2017 If you haven't devoted your life to becoming an astronaut, then it could be a long time before you get the chance to go to outer space . The next best thing for space enthusiasts is owning something that has been to the final frontier instead. You could shell out a lot of cash to buy a NASA collectible or a meteorite sample, but it turns out that all you need to get your own space souvenir is a roof, a couple of magnets, and a lot of patience.   While large meteorites occasionally fall to Earth , they are very rare and extremely difficult to get. But smaller meteorites, called micrometeorites, fall to Earth every day, all over the place. Scientists estimate that more than 100 tons of space dust falls to Earth every single day, and some of that space dust will land on your roof. With a good setup, you can collect that dust and have your very own tiny meteorite collection. Most Popular A group of scientists recently collected over 600 pounds of material from thousands of city rooftops, and after filtering them, they found over 500 micrometeorites. These meteorites are tiny, but they land on every rooftop in the world multiple times a year. The scientists estimate that you can expect one micrometeorite per year for every square meter of rooftop space. Collecting these meteorites is easy because they are typically highly magnetic. If you place a strong magnet in your rain gutter, it will passively collect any magnetic particles that run over it. Every few months, clean off your magnet and collect anything that sticks to it, and use a microscope or powerful magnifying glass to separate the meteorites from the dirt and the dust. You could have a sizable meteorite collection in no time, and you won't have to pay a dime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:46:53.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
