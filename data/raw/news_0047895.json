She is expected to make an official announcement early this week. \nShe devoted herself entirely to the sport until recent years, spending most of that time overseas enduring harsh training schedules that often lasted almost all day. \nShe also suffered numerous injuries. \"It was so hard that I thought about quitting a million times,\" she said in an interview earlier. \nWhile an Olympic medal eluded her -- she placed 5th in London in 2012 and 4th in Rio last year -- Son ushered in a new era in Korean gymnastics, rising steadily from her 32nd place finish at the 2010 world championships to the 4th place in Rio. \nShe trained tirelessly, and it paid off as she positioned herself at the forefront of the sport in Korea. \nSon plans to transition into a coaching role, and has reportedly received an offer from China's national team.
