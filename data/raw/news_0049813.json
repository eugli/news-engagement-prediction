(ABC Radio Brisbane: Jessica Hinchliffe) \n\"I went as a graphic recorder to help the CSIRO communicate their science to the Indigenous fishers on the island,\" she said. \n\"Scientists present their findings to the Indigenous community, and since the science is complex I try and visualise what their results are and interpret the science into words and pictures and provide a visual story. \n\"The visual story is then given to the community to take back to the islands and talk about what they've learnt.\" \nDr Pillans said travelling to remote communities was a highlight of her job. \n\"It's been an amazing experience for me, having the Indigenous fishers drawing their totems with me and telling me about their animals and oceans. \n\"I've worked in remote schools in Western Australia with the CSIRO and I use art and science to tell them more about how megafauna moves throughout the ocean.\" \nHer illustrations are predominantly water colours. \n\"I let the colour move around in a fluid nature like the animal itself and it comes to life on the page. \n\"I really love the medium.\" \nShe said her favourite marine animal to draw was the whale shark due to its size and grace. \n\"I've worked with research groups to tag them and they're the most beautiful animals to swim with.\" Alter ego Dr Suzie Starfish \nDr Pillans' alter ego Dr Susie Starfish visits schools to help children, especially girls, learn more about the ocean. \n\"It's the most amazing feeling to walk into a school and the little kids see you and start yelling: 'Here comes Dr Suzie Starfish!' \n\"I'm sort of like an ocean rock star. \n\"If you can engage with kids who are the future ocean stewards and talk to them about the science and technology through art, it's an amazing feeling.\" \nShe said she believed the STEM curriculum — science, technology, engineering and mathematics — should also include art, changing the acronym to STEAM. \n\"I think art needs to be involved to help children learn more easily.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:41:20.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
