On the occasion of Valentine's Day, she tweeted a picture of herself surrounded by dozens of bouquets and gifts from male fans.\nThe bubbly, charming actress connects not only with kids and young girls, but is a hit among the male audience too. And she doesn't seem to mind the attention that she gets.\nAsked to recollect the craziest thing that a fan has done for her, Ameesha laughs and says, \"Last year, I met a guy, who is a big fan. He has been crazy about me for several years and has seen my film, Bhool Bhulaiyaa, about 50 times on DVD since he loves to see me in Indian wear. He flew down from London on Valentine's Day, specially to meet me, that too, just for just a picture. He wanted to see how I look in real life. So, he just landed up at my office.\"\nThe globetrotter, who was recently in Ranchi and Delhi on work commitments, is on a jetting spree. She was last seen in Race 2 and when we ask her about the journey ahead, she says, \"The gap has been long, but it is for the better. The road ahead looks beautiful and promising.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T08:06:38.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
