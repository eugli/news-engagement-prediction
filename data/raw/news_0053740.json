Bill James described it Wednesday to the judicial inquiry into the fatal police shooting of Don Dunphy.\nDunphy was fatally shot in his Mitchells Brook home on April 5, 2015 by RNC Const. Joe Smyth who went to the St. Mary's Bay town to speak with Dunphy about tweets that criticized the premier and some MHAs.\nDon Dunphy, 59, was fatally shot by RNC Const. Joe Smyth on April 5, 2015.\nSmyth says he fired at Dunphy four times in self defence after Dunphy pointed a 22-calibre rifle at him.\n'I still feel that gun pointed at me': RNC officer re-enacts shooting of Don Dunphy James trained Smyth in use of force and said he never saw Smyth use excessive force or behave angrily.\nQuestions Wednesday morning focused on the number of times an officer is trained to shoot to stop a threat.\nJames \"shot to the head is to eliminate the threat. It's referred to as the fail-safe shot\" #dunphy\n— @CBCMarkQuinn James said they are trained to shot twice to the body, reassess, then shot at the head. He called this \"the fail-safe\" shot.\nHe also said there are situations where an officer may not have time to reassess and must continue shooting until a threat is stopped.\nJustice Leo Barry is leading the inquiry. He is expecting to receive a report comparing U.S. and Canadian use-of-force models. He said the Canadian model puts more emphasis on de-escalating rather than using deadly force.\nThe RCMP investigated the shooting and concluded that Smyth used appropriate force.\nBreen considering legal options, partner says Meanwhile, a prominent St. John's defence lawyer is getting legal advice in the wake of provocative comments a senior RCMP officer made about her on Tuesday.\nStaff Sgt. Kent Osmond on Tuesday accused Erin Breen, who is representing Dunphy's daughter Meghan, of \"scandalous\" actions just days after Don Dunphy was killed.\nIn a letter to the RCMP on April 14, 2015, Breen asked for an outside force to investigate the Dunphy shooting and accused the RCMP investigators of \"tunnel vision.\"\nOsmond startled Breen on Tuesday with a spirited reaction to that letter.\n\"To get a letter from a legal counsel accusing me of tunnel vision and send that to people who can affect my career,\" Osmond testified.\n\"To question my integrity and the integrity of people under my command and then to suggest that the tunnel vision permeates my unit is so egregious that it questions all the investigations that we have done … I think it's scandalous,\" he said.\nOn Wednesday, Breen's legal partner Bob Simmonds told the inquiry that Breen is seeking getting legal advice about Osmond's comments.\nSimmonds says Breen believes Osmond was suggesting her conduct was \"unbecoming\" of a lawyer, which he said is \"a very serious allegation.\"\nOne of her options is to sue for defamation.\nSecond witness Heather MacLean was the director of communications for the office of then-premier Paul Davis. She is expected to testify after 3 p.m.\nFollow along with the inquiry in our live blog .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CBCMarkQuinn/status/834406480128393216", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/dunphy?src=hash"], "published": "2017-02-22T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:09:22.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
