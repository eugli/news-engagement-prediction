By space standards, this is apparently not that far. \nAlso, these planets look dope! Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech \nI mean, why wouldn’t you want to live on this? Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech \nAs interesting as it would be to find life elsewhere in the universe, I’m excited to have (potentially) seven new Earth-like planets for us to escape too since the current one we’re on is soon going to be uninhabitable. Political discontent, climate change and unrelenting religious strife don’t really bode well for our survival here. \nPlus, I’ve seen Interstellar and watched The Martian several times over. I’m pretty sure I can nail this surviving on a new world thing. Also, I am very tiny and my space pod would weigh a negligible amount. Plus, I think I can talk Chris Evans into becoming a fellow colonizer. How fun would that be?

We’ll probably screw that up as well, but whatever, let me know if there’s a list I can put my name on to start colonizing.
