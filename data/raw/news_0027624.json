Not only will these efforts enhance efficiency at our shared border, they will also strengthen our shared security.”\nTrump says NAFTA deal with Canada will only be 'tweaked' \nTrump, Trudeau avoid climate change talk \nFreeland sees U.S. 'enthusiasm' for easing cross-border trade \nCorporate Canada encouraged by Trump's comments on NAFTA \nIsrael leader's White House trip clouded in uncertainty \nFrom statements to seating: What goes into a prime ministerial meeting \nTrudeau meets Trump: Handshake inspires awkward commentary on Twitter \nTrudeau meets Trump: A guide to the day \nFive pieces of advice for PM Trudeau meeting with President Trump \nTrump, Trudeau to discuss women in the workforce \nCanada hopes for progress on border preclearance in Trump-Trudeau meeting \nA look at trade growth in Canada, U.S. under North American Free Trade Agreement \nConservatives pause hostilities with Liberals on eve of Trump, Trudeau meeting \nTrudeau shouldn't worry about 'dangers,' focus on opportunity with Trump: former ambassador \nPhotos U.S. President Donald Trump participates in a discussion with female leaders, including Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland (left), at the White House, in Washington, D.C., on Monday, Feb. 13, 2017.
