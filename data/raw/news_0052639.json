Justin Bieber suffers embarrassing mishap as he’s spotted with huge wet patch on his jogging bottoms in Hollywood \nLight grey really isn’t a great colour for an unfortunate crotch spillage By Lauren Franklin, Showbiz Reporter 23rd February 2017, 11:44 pm Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Comments JUSTIN Bieber may think he’s cooler than thou, however on Thursday his credibility slipped when he was walking around Hollywood with a huge wet patch on the crotch area of his grey jogging bottoms. \nThe 22-year-old was seemingly unaware of the suspicious looking patch and was giving his full attention to his phone as he sipped on a green drink. MEGA 5 Justin Bieber was pictured with an unfortunate wet stain on his crotch \nDressed casually in the jogging bottoms, a grey denim jacket, white T-shirt and brightly coloured trainers, Biebs made no effort to cover the large wet stain as he made his way to his car. \nHe was also sporting a freshly bleached hairdo, however that wasn’t enough of a beacon to distract away from his wet crotch. Justin Bieber emerges with mysterious wet patch on his sweatpants MEGA The singer was apparently unaware that he had the suspicious looking stain MEGA 5 The freshly bleached singer was too engrossed in his phone to notice \nJustin has recently landed himself in hot water after he was accused of pulling a sickie to avoid going to court. \nLast week the pop superstar’s lawyer told the judge he was “too ill” to attend a deposition in a legal battle over one of his songs. \nBut hours later several videos of the 22-year-old Canadian chugging beers at a house party and nightclub surfaced on the internet. MEGA 5 As he pulled his car keys out of his pocket the extent of the patch was further revealed \nBieber, who is being sued by indie singer Casey Dienel for allegedly ripping from one of her songs for his 2015 hit Sorry, also posted several photos to his Instagram account of the drink session with pals. \nDienel’s lawyers filed documents saying: “Justin Bieber is not above the law. Justin Bieber knowingly and in bad faith failed to appear at his scheduled, agreed upon deposition. MEGA 5 The singer is currently in hot water for skipping a court appearance \n“He has thumbed his nose at this Court, the lawyers involved, including his own lawyers, and the judicial system: A court order compelling Justin Bieber to appear in-person.” \nThe singer is also being investigated after allegedly headbutting a man at an LA restaurant last weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:06:40.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
