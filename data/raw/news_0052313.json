Lib Dem Lord Tyler tells the programme: ‘It’s the best day care centre for the elderly in London. Families can drop in him or her and make sure that the staff will look after him very well – and he can have a snooze in the afternoon in the Chamber or in the library.’ Former Lords Speaker Baroness D’Souza says she once witnessed a peer leave a taxi waiting outside while he popped inside to ‘clock in’ and claim his tax-free £300 attendance allowance. Yeoman Usher Brigadier Neil Baverstock (left) and Black Rod David Leakey (right) The documentary offers viewers a glimpse into the Lords Chamber Members of The House of Lords sit in the chamber as they wait for the State Opening of Parliament Redcoat Jason Bean pictured outside the House of Lords. A Lords spokesman insisted the documentary showed how it was doing its work as ‘an active and effective revising chamber’ There are no checks on what a peer does after signing in, meaning unscrupulous members are free to leave immediately. Lady D’Souza’s intervention is all the more remarkable given that she came under fire in 2015 for charging £230 expenses for keeping her chauffeur-driven car waiting four hours while she went to the opera on official duty. During a private screening of the first episode of the three-part documentary, there were ‘gasps of shock’ when Lady D’Souza – nicknamed the Baroness of Excess – told the taxi anecdote. One peer said: ‘The clear implication was that the peer was on the fiddle and wasn’t the only one. People couldn’t believe she said it. It was blatant double standards.’ As Lords Speaker, Lady D’Souza, 72, was responsible for presiding over debates in the Upper House. In 2015, it also emerged that she had run up a £30,000 bill for entertaining dignitaries over five years, including £1,120 for taking Russian delegates to the ballet. In the documentary, she says that the ‘sense of honour’ that used to accompany a peerage has been lost following a wave of political appointments, and that while most worked hard, there were, ‘sad to say, many, many, many peers who contribute absolutely nothing but who claim the full allowance’. There have been repeated calls to reform the House of Lords which has more than 800 members, including 90 hereditary peers. A Lords spokesman insisted the documentary showed how it was doing its work as ‘an active and effective revising chamber’.

The Labour leader ordered peers to support the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill when it is put to a vote next month. But diehard pro-Remain peers used a marathon debate in the Lords last night to serve notice that they will attempt to frustrate or even block Brexit. Lord Livermore, who masterminded Ed Miliband’s disastrous election campaign, said peers had a duty to overturn a referendum result based on ‘fake promises and false assurances’. ‘If we sincerely believe the course we are on will do untold damage to our country, we have a duty whether elected or unelected to say so, to oppose it and to tell the truth,’ he said. Baroness Kennedy, another leading Labour peer, said: ‘I will support vital amendments and if they aren’t accepted I’m going to vote against this bill. ‘This House should be urging a rethink on this whole project.’ Lords sources said opposition to Brexit was running so strong in some quarters that peers could hold a final vote on the principle of the legislation next month, potentially rejecting it and throwing Mrs May’s Brexit timetable into disarray. Labour last night insisted there were not enough rebels to derail Brexit.
