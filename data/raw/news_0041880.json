The equipment was good, and I was happy with the drive, but we just got crushed at the start and that is where we lost it,\" Humphries said in a press release.\n\"Silver is not satisfying when the gold was right there, but we have to focus on the positive,\" added Humphries. \"Melissa has made a lot of improvements this year which has been awesome to see, but together we have a lot of improvements in all elements of the sport to continue working on in order to get back on top. The Olympics is a different beast. We have this summer to learn, and get back to work.\"\nJamie Greubel Poser of the U.S. was third, 0.23 seconds back with brakewoman Aja Evans, for her first world championship medal.\n\"Kaillie gave me a run for the money from top to the finish. So I knew I had to put it together. And today we did,\" said Meyers, who held a 0.02-second lead after Friday's first two runs.\n\"We have been doing better at the start all year so to be seventh and eighth at the start on day one was a tough pill to swallow,\" Lotholz said. \"It was a little frustrating the starts didn't align, but we'll review things with our support team and pinpoint what else could be improved on the push. We will learn from this.\"\nEuropean champion Mariama Jamanka and her brakewoman Annika Drazek of Germany were fourth, followed by Christina Hengster and Jennifer Onasanya of Austria.\nAlysia Rissling of Calgary and Cynthia Appiah of Toronto were sixth. Japan's Maria Oshigiri and Arisa Kimishima celebrated their debut by placing seventh.\nKripps, Lumsden 2nd in men's In the men's event, the Canadian duo of Justin Kripps and Jesse Lumsden sit in second place at the halfway point.\nFrancesco Friedrich of Germany is in the lead, 0.52 seconds ahead of the Canadians. Johannes Lochner is currently third.\nCanada's Nick Poloniato and Neville Wright are fourth, just 0.73 back of Friedrich.\n\"I love this track and love driving here every time,\" Kripps said. \"And of course I had some really good results at Königssee before. Now two Canadian sleds in the top four – that's awesome.\"\nWith files from CBC Sports, The Associated Press © Thomson Reuters, 2017", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/"], "published": "2017-02-18T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T09:34:15.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
