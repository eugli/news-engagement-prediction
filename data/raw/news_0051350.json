Charles Bronson's bride-to-be admits it's a huge risk to marry notorious criminal \nMr Smith outlined the case saying that the teenager had allegedly attacked his victim in a bedroom. \nThe foster family, who had cared for the boy for over two years before the alleged attack, contacted social services and police after the victim told his mother that ‘his bottom hurt’. \nHe also told police: ‘He did some bad stuff to me. He hurt me. He does it every day.’ \nInternal tests on the child revealed traces of semen and swabs showed the DNA of the defendant. Storm Doris to hit Britain this week with strong winds and heavy snow \nMr Smith added: ‘The defendant’s DNA profile was found on these swabs. The Crown cannot say for certain the DNA came from semen but we can say semen was found in the anal canal and DNA was on the swabs. \n‘It could have come from the defendant’s bodily fluids, such as saliva. \n‘The Crown says that proves strong support for the theory the defendant spat on his finger and put it in his anus.’ \nThe juvenile defendant was interviewed the next day but denied all the allegations and said only ‘no comment.’ \nThe teenager denies the allegations and the trial continues.
