The burning pile of wood and brush could be seen from the road. A passerby spotted the blaze, and firefighters responded for an \"uncontrolled brush fire.\" \nThe grisly discovery is being handled as a suspicious death. Police are asking for the public's help. \n\"It will take information from the public to help\" solve the case, said Val Joyner, a spokeswoman for the St. Charles County Police Department. \nJoyner said police have no information about a suspect. \nThe department's Bureau of Criminal Investigations is handling the case. The crime tips hotline is 636-949-3002. Tipsters can remain anonymous. \nPolice are working with the medical examiner's office to identify the remains and determine the cause of death. The cause of the fire hasn't been determined either, Joyner said. \nThe burn pile was in the Orchard Farm area of unincorporated St. Charles County. Jeremey Hollrah, chief of the Orchard Farm Fire Protection District, said his department was called to the fire and had it under control in about 20 minutes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:12:06.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
