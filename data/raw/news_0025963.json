The end product of its evolution, 7 billion years from now, will be a tiny white dwarf star. \n“This will be about the size of the Earth, but much heavier: one tea spoon of white dwarf material weighs about 5 tons.” Share this: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T10:01:48.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
