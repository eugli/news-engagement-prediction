While the fast acting legislation has been related to platforms he promised in the past, Congress has not stepped up and agreed to or bucked any of the laws. Now, some are beginning to place the blame on Congress for being against Trump as if executive orders were his last resort.\nMedia: MediaOS Video Take a look at the memes spreading across the Twitterverse above.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TrumpDraws"], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:52:03.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
