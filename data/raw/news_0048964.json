Will let you people know whenever I will visit the national capital,\" Ghafoor said while interacting with a section of media persons on the sidelines of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's weekly 'Lok Samvad' programme here.Shahabuddin is still a national executive member of his party. On being asked if Shahabuddin's controversial remarks against CM Nitish Kumar, calling him \"a CM of circumstances\" while coming out of Bhagalpur central jail, annoyed the state machinery against the convicted former MP, Ghafoor promptly disapproved Shahabuddin's remark and said, \"Nitish Kumar Ji was made CM in a truthful circumstance.\"The minister also denied any partial role of Bihar government in Shahabuddin-related judicial matters. He said, the former RJD MP was recently transferred to Tihar jail at the directive of the Supreme Court and the state government didn't play any partial role in it. \"Bihar government went to the apex court not only in Shahabuddin's case but also in many other cases including those of expelled RJD MLA Rajballabh Yadav, expelled MP Pappu Yadav, BJP MLC Tunnaji Pandey and Gaya road rage case,\" the minister argued.On being asked about the controversial photograph showing him with Shahabuddin inside the jail and having some snacks, the minister reiterated what is wrong if a political person went to meet the former MP of his party after procuring necessary permission from the concerned jail authorities.Last year, when the minister's photograph having some snacks with Shahabuddin inside the Siwan jail went viral, RJD chief Lalu Prasad had defended Ghafoor, saying \"There is nothing wrong or illegal in dining with a convict.\"The minister avoided a direct reply on being asked whether RJD should remove Shahabuddin from its national executive after his conviction in a murder cases. \"His wife Heena Shahab had contested Lok Sabha polls from Siwan seat on RJD symbol. She is still with party,\" the minister said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:10:29.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
