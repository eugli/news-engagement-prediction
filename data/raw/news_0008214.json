How and why they did this is because they’re grand illusionists. Every time they have a problem with something, they create another problem.” \nShe continued on to say that this is just “red meat” to Trump’s supporters and told Bushra about what Democrats have been doing at airports around the country to help people detained under the ban. \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:10:09.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
