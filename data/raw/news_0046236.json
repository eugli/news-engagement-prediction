Mesa casts doubt on that long-held understanding of the law, however. \n“That has been under a lot of pressure and challenge recently,” Fordham University School of Law professor Andrew Kent told reporters on a conference call last week. \nThe Supreme Court opened the door to a possible revision with a 2008 ruling that held that prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility had a right to petition the U.S. courts even though Gitmo is on foreign soil and the detainees were foreigners who never even had been to the United States. \nAttorneys for the family of Sergio Hernández quote liberally from that case, Boumediene v. Bush, in their written legal arguments. \nU.S. Border Patrol agents worry a decision in favor of the plaintiffs would make it harder for them to do their jobs, and legal scholars speculate that it could — depending on how expansive the language in the opinion is — impact immigration more generally. \nThe facts of the case are unusual — and in dispute. The plaintiffs contend that Hernández, who was 15 at the time in 2010, was playing a game with some friends that involved running up to a fence at the top of an embankment in front of a culvert that separates Mexico from the United States between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:24:29.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
