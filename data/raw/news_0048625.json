Trump 'shows great heart' towards immigrant children \nThe memos leave in place one directive from the Obama administration, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows young people who were brought into the country illegally as children to stay and obtain work permits. \nThe program has protected about 750,000 immigrants since its inception in 2012.

(ABC News: Stephanie March) \nMr Trump has previously indicated his desire to end the program, but at his media conference last week indicated that he would \"show great heart\" toward the program. \nThe guidelines direct agents to only pass applicants who have a good chance of ultimately getting asylum, but does not give specific criteria for establishing credible fear of persecution if sent home. There was a surge in the number of migrants crossing America's south-west border from Mexico in the weeks leading up to the election and the days after. \nIn 2015, just 18 per cent of asylum applicants whose cases were ruled on by immigration judges were granted asylum, according to the Justice Department. \nApplicants from countries with a high rate of political persecution had a higher chance of winning their asylum cases. \nThe memos were reported first by The Washington Post and other news organisations. \nA US official familiar with the documents did not dispute the accuracy of the memos signed by Mr Kelly, which were originally scheduled for release last Friday before they were postponed for White House review. \nA White House official said it had raised objections with the documents and was working with DHS to finalise the policy. \nThe official was not authorised to discuss the process publicly and insisted on anonymity. \nUnder the draft guidelines, Mr Kelly seeks to \"expeditiously hire\" 10,000 more enforcement agents and 5,000 border patrol officers.

(ABC News: Stephanie March) 'Immediately begin planning, construction of wall' \nSeeking to fulfil Mr Trump's campaign promise to build a wall along the Mexican border, Mr Kelly also called on Customs and Border Protection to \"immediately begin planning, design, construction and maintenance of a wall, including the attendant lighting, technology [including sensors], as well as patrol and access roads.\" Donald Trump's plan to build a border wall with Mexico raises many questions. \nHe described the wall as necessary to deter illegal immigration and called it a \"critical component\" of Mr Trump's overall border security strategy. \nMr Kelly said the department would also prioritise for more immediate removal of those who had been convicted of a crime; charged with a crime; committed fraud in connection with a matter before a government agency; abused any program related to public benefits; or have not complied with orders to leave the country. \nJoanne Lin, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, criticised the proposed guidelines as a Trump-style of immigration enforcement in which \"due process, human decency and common sense are treated as inconvenient obstacles on the path to mass deportation\". \n\"The Trump administration is intent on inflicting cruelty on millions of immigrant families across the country,\" she said in a statement. \nAP/Reuters First posted February 20, 2017 10:48:44 The Trump presidency", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:38:17.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
