During the telephone conversation, Buhari was overheard thanking those, who attended the prayer session led by Ganduje, alongside many Islamic scholars, prominent politicians and imams. Ganduje said, “Your Excellency, you are calling at the right time — when we have gathered here praying to Almighty Allah for your quick recovery. All the participants said they are extending their heart-felt greetings to you. “ As Ganduje started his remarks at the prayer session, one of his aides handed over a cell phone to him even as those present at the event expressed surprise to hear the voice of the President. Many people who gathered for the prayer session burst into tears as soon as they heard the President’s voice while some were relieved to hear his voice. “We are very grateful for all the efforts Nigerians are putting in — praying for my quick and successful recovery. May Almighty Allah reward you abundantly. My sincere regards to all,” Buhari was quoted as saying. Also, Ganduje disclosed to the President that, on Friday, there would be special prayer session in over 7,000 mosques of the state, emphasising that the call from the President was a sign of good things to come to the country. Shortly after the telephone conversation with the President, Ganduje said there was nothing more to pray for as Buhari’s call was a reflection that Allah had answered their prayers. “We are very happy that Allah has showed us that He answers prayers because the voice of the person we have gathered to pray for shows that he is recuperating quickly and happily,” the governor said.
