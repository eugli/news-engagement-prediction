It comes in the wake of his admission that the claim that he had lost “close, personal friends” at the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster was untrue .\nThe claims, twice made in posts on the website, vanished shortly after Nuttall’s admission on Tuesday. On Wednesday night the entire content of the site disappeared, and was replaced with a notice that read: “Site is offline for maintenance. We are currently undergoing scheduled maintenance. Sorry for the inconvenience. Please try back soon.”\nIt is the second time in less than a week that Nuttall has failed to attend a hustings event in the constituency. On Saturday he did not attend one at a local sixth form college. Voting is just one week away.\nAccording to Ukip activists in Stoke, Nuttall has been finding it hard to juggle his commitments as party leader and as an MEP for the North West with campaigning in the constituency. \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ukip leader denies responsibility for website Hillsborough claim \n“We had 237 activists here on one Saturday; I’ve honestly never seen a campaign as optimistic as this,” one campaigner said. “But Paul is the party leader and he has commitments nationally and in Brussels.”\nThe Ukip leader did not appear at a crucial vote on the EU-Canada trade deal at the EU parliament on Wednesday, however. Seven other Ukip MEPs, including Nigel Farage, voted against the Ceta deal in Strasbourg, with another abstaining. Nuttall was among 15 Ukip MEPs who did not vote in Strasbourg. \nOn Thursday, at the hustings event in Stoke, the Ukip media and sport spokesman, Patrick O’Flynn, turned up in Nuttall’s place. Many in the crowd applauded when the Labour candidate, Gareth Snell, condemned Nuttall’s failure to attend the two hustings events, and his failure to vote in the European parliament on a plan to overhaul a trading scheme to cut carbon emissions, which he said would have a direct bearing on the constituency.\nWhy Stoke is make or break time for Ukip | Alexandra Phillips Read more \nMP Vernon Coaker, a member of Labour’s campaign team, said: “With just one week until the Stoke Central byelection, Paul Nuttall is nowhere to be seen. It seems that on his list of priorities, writing speeches and glad-handing at conferences come above the concerns of hardworking voters.”\nA Ukip spokesman said Nuttall would keep to a commitment to appear on BBC Radio Stoke alongside Conservative, Green party, Lib Dem and Labour byelection candidates at 7pm on Thursday.\nNuttall, the Ukip leader for less than three months, has faced a difficult week, with people who have known him for many years saying he has only recently begun stating that he was a survivor of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 Liverpool fans died, and then being forced to admit that his claim to have lost personal friends was false.\nHe later blamed that false claim on an error made by a press officer. He previously blamed the same press officer for another false claim on the same website: that he had once been a professional footballer.\nWhen challenged last year about the false claim that he had a PhD, which appeared on a LinkedIn networking site under his name, Nuttall insisted that he did not know who had created the site.\nStaffordshire police are currently investigating an allegation of election fraud after Nuttall submitted nomination papers in which he gave an address for a property in Stoke-on-Trent Central, which he subsequently admitted he had not yet set foot in. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:58:53.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
