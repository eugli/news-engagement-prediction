Stepping onstage with Skip Marley, Perry wore a tailored white Tom Ford pantsuit with matching bustier and rounded sunglasses. Selecting a pair of sneakers from her namesake line, the singer kept things on brand, but her boldest style statement came in the form of a social justice statement. Wearing a Planned Parenthood pin on her lapel and a glittery armband with the word “persist” etched across it, Perry was unabashedly political throughout a performance that urged viewers to be just as outspoken. Perry’s willingness to literally wear her beliefs on her sleeve has become part of her persona, and her latest outfit incorporates the spirit of her many politically focused outfits. Unlike the time she wore a sparkle-covered version of the American flag, this latest number was a subtle tribute rather than a foray into kitsch. With her music and her presentation changing to reflect the woman she’s become, you can expect Perry’s next few looks to be equally exciting.
