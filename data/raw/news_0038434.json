A financial adviser immediately suggested investing in a new home, with a budget of around £1.5 million. Imagine the thrill I felt that evening, looking at all those fabulous houses, boasting private tennis courts and rolling lawns, knowing I could take my pick. And yet, by the time I shut down my computer several hours later, that initial buzz had completely evaporated. I felt overwhelmed rather than excited at the prospect of every woman’s fantasy becoming my reality. I was awake all night, mulling over the hours it would take to clean a big house, asking myself what was the point of a tennis court when I hadn’t picked up a racquet since school — and stressing over finding a gardener to maintain lawns I didn’t even own yet. I felt upset thinking how much I’d miss chatting with my neighbours over our rickety garden fence and imagining how lonely and cut off I might end up feeling in a fabulous home set behind imposing electronic gates. Amanda says 'Actually, it took me becoming immensely wealthy to realise just how little real value belongings actually hold' As I lay there, it struck me more profoundly than it ever had before that all my happiness in life truly depended on was the people in it. My friends and my family were what defined me, not the size of my house or the things inside it. I got more gratification from a chat with the bin men or sharing a pot of tea with our postie than I’d ever fully appreciated until now. Living in an ivory tower would deny me those simple pleasures. As morning dawned so did the realisation that you are only ever happy or unhappy — there isn’t a sliding scale in between those two states that can be influenced by what you do or don’t possess. There was so little about my life that I actually wanted to change. So we stayed put. The next day I booked a holiday to Majorca — the first I’d taken without having had to scrimp and save for it. I did that before paying off £30,000 of credit card debt. Apart from never having to worry about whether we could pay our bills again and being able to indulge a previously unrequited passion for travel, little else has changed. She continues: 'For me, the phrase ‘money doesn’t buy happiness’ is more than a cliche — it is a dictum by which I live my life' We bought a nondescript three-bedroom house on a busy estate for the boys — our base at the moment while they’re away at university. When they move back in next year, we may pick up something similarly modest for ourselves or even rent. Only yesterday, my neighbour told me that she didn’t get it. That if she had my money she’d be living in luxury — shopping for designer clothes, day in and day out. ‘And then what?’ I asked her. ‘Once you’d filled that big house with bling where would you look next for happiness? When would it all ever finally be enough?’ Then she got it. Because the truth is, when you fail to separate one from the other, happiness only ever lies at the end of the next shopping trip. And that will never be the kind of happiness that I’m looking for.
