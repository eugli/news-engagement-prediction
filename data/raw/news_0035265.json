After being tossed from Madison Square Garden and arrested for beefing with Knicks owner James Dolan, Oakley is back in the headlines—but this time, not for anything he’s done wrong.\nOakley is the latest former basketball player to announce he is joining Ice Cube’s 3-on-3 basketball league . And, yes, he’ll even get out there on the court. Oakley, 53, will be a player/coach on a team that includes Chauncey B-B-Billups and Stephen Jackson.\nBig 3 announced the news on its website Friday.\nRelated Charles Barkley Rips the James Dolan and Charles Oakley Feud to Shreds Charles Oakley's Madison Square Garden Ban Is Over Ice Cube, Former NBA Players Are Launching a Touring 3-on-3 Summer Basketball League “I couldn’t be happier to be a part of this league,” Oakley said in a statement. “Everyone seems to realize we are about to make history together as players. What an exciting opportunity to stand shoulder to shoulder with some of the best ever.”\nBig 3 had publicly posted support of Oakley  on its website last week, during his spat with Dolan.\n\nThe games will commence in late June. Since the league launched in January, it’s landed a number of former big names, including: Allen Iverson, Gary Payton, Kenyon Martin, Jermaine O’Neal, Rashard Lewis, Bonzi Wells, George Gervin, Ricky Davis, Jason Williams, and Clyde Drexler.\nThe league won’t start until after the NBA Finals.
