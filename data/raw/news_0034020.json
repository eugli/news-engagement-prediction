but this time in the most marginal seat in the state. \nWith by-elections scheduled for Manly and North Shore in the wake of the announced retirements of former premier Mike Baird and former health minister Jillian Skinner, Ms Smith’s retirement is set to add her seat of Gosford to the list. \nIt is the most marginal seat in the state — with Labor having won it by 203 votes against former Liberal MP Chris Holstein in 2015. media_camera Former MP for Robertson Belinda Neal and then Labor Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change Greg Combet. media_camera Labor MP Kathy Smith is set to stand down. \nThe resignation had the potential to open the way for another tilt at Labor preselection by controversial former federal MP Belinda Neal, who was embroiled in the Iguanagate affair. \nHowever, Ms Neal has told Labor officials she will not be running, despite earlier rumours she had her husband, former minister John Della Bosca, had been working the numbers . \nA senior Labor official had even claimed “under no circumstances will Belinda Neal be the candidate”. \nFavourite for the seat is failed federal Robertson candidate Anne Charlton. \nIn a letter to constituents to be sent out tomorrow, Ms Smith will say: “There is no greater honour than to represent your community in Parliament and that is why it is with great sadness that I announce my decision to resign as your Member for Gosford. \n“When I was diagnosed with cancer last year, my doctors were positive that with \ntreatment I would win my second battle with this disease. \n“Unfortunately the cancer has metastasised and will now require further treatment. \n“ ... It has been a pleasure to fight for the rights and entitlements of the people in my \ncommunity in all matters big or small. \n“Now it is time for someone else to continue the fight for the Central Coast. \n“I appreciate your understanding at this time. Please keep me in your prayers as my family and I focus on my continued treatment and recovery. media_camera Ms Smith’s resignation will trigger a by-election for her seat. \n“Thank you to everyone for your support during this difficult period. It has been an honour to represent you.” \nAlthough the government may struggle to pick up the seat, one unknown quantity could be the prospect of an independent candidate backed by businessman John Singleton, who ran candidates at the last federal election on the Central Coast. \nMs Smith’s resignation from parliament comes as Ms Skinner has still failed to resign her seat despite announcing on January 27 she was going. \nThe fact that Ms Skinner has yet to vacate her seat of North Shore has some speculating that she wants to give a valedictory address on the way out when parliament resumes tomorrow — a speech which would not please all of her Liberal colleagues. \nMs Skinner’s office was still taking calls last week as if the MP was still the local member and Ms Skinner did not respond to inquiries as to when she would actually leave parliament. \nThe former minister’s retirement from politics requires a letter to the Speaker, Shelley Hancock. \nColleagues see the delay in resigning as just another part of the “dummy spit” similar to that which saw Ms Skinner tell Premier Gladys Berejiklian “It’s health or nothing” before Ms Berejiklian stared her down and dumped her from cabinet a fortnight ago. \nA left field candidate backed by Ms Skinner has emerged as a chance to win Liberal preselection for the seat, academic Jessica Kean. \nOthers mooted for the seat have included former Medicines Australia boss Tim James and moderate Felicity Wilson, who is rumoured to be part of a factional deal between the Centre Right and the moderates for the moderates to retain control of the seat. \nWith council amalgamations having been an issue in the seat, Premier Berejiklian has fears of losing it to an independent candidate. \nBut one mooted possible candidate, former North Sydney mayor Genia McCaffery, has ruled out running for the seat. \nIt is unknown whether former independent candidate, Dr Stephen Ruff will again run for the seat.
