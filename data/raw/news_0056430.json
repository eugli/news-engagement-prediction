Written by A. Kameshwari | New Delhi | Updated: February 22, 2017 6:57 pm Sushant Singh Rajput’s next film – Chanda Mama Door Ke – is based on Apollo 11. \nSushant Singh Rajput is going to be a part of a never-seen-before kind of Indian cinema, which is a space adventure film, titled Chanda Mama Door Ke. While the title has made his fans excited, not much about the film is known. However, the actor has dropped a huge hint about his film, which is making it one of the most anticipated projects of the year. The actor shared a picture on Twitter in which one can spot Chanda Mama’s script and also scripts written Apollo 11 on them. \nApollo 11 was the spaceflight on which Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin travelled to the Moon. Well, that kind of gives us an idea that the film might have something to do with humans setting their foot on moon. That sounds super exciting, doesn’t it? \nThe 31-year-old actor, who plays an astronaut in the film, took to Twitter where he posted a picture with flight journals and wrote, “I’d always wondered how Armstrong, Buzz and Michael were feeling during those nine days to the Moon. Well, now I know #flightjournal #Apollo11,” Sushant wrote, along side the photo on Twitter. \nMore from the world of Entertainment: \n\nFor the project, filmmaker Sanjay Puran Singh Chauhan has spent a lot of time researching at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Filming will start sometime in July. \nAlso read | R. Madhavan is proud of his son Vedant’s swimming talent and is showing off for the world to see \nRecently, the filmmakers also announced that apart from Sushant the film will also star R. Madhavan. The actor would play a pilot. Talking about his role to PTI, Madhavan said, “I can’t wait to see this film with my son. I am sure he will be proud of me. It’s such an awesome story and fantastic team. This role will definitely require much prepping as we are doing it with a lot of authenticities.” \nSee Sushant Singh Rajput’s post: I’d always wondered how Armstrong, Buzz & Michael were feeling during those 9 days to the Moon.
