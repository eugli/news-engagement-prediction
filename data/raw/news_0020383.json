(ABC News) \nDr Thompson said if the river system was contaminated it could make it harder for farms to recover. \n\"If it's widespread in the wild then clearly that makes it difficult to manage into the future,\" he said. \n\"If you can't be certain of how clean the water that comes into these properties is then you have some real concerns about managing it.\" \nBut he said Biosecurity Queensland would not jump to conclusions until more testing was done, including an investigation into whether the prawns came from a nearby farm. \nHe said more frequent testing would be rolled out in Moreton Bay, the Pine River and the Brisbane River to check if other wild prawns were infected. \nThe area accounts for about one-third of Australia's $90-million farmed prawn industry.
