Judge Parker told Geoghegan she had caused stress and damage to the animals, Mr and Mrs Lee and the owners of the horse they looked after. The messages started the day after the five horses had been attacked. 'There was an immediate public broadcast of what had taken place and you took advantage of that in order to carry out these offences of blackmail,' he said. 'You were aware of the distress the damage to the horses had causes and seriously aggravated the concerns of those owners. The owners launched an online appeal for information and offered a reward after reporting the attack to police The next day, following a Facebook friend request, they started receiving the threatening messages from Geoghegan who said she was sharpening her machete to attack again 'You sent at least four messages, repeatedly threatening to mutilate and kill the animals at the yard unless you were given Â£5,000. 'Those threats were intended to be thoroughly frightening to the owners of the horses and the yard. 'You were motivated either by spite, greed or a combination of both,' he said. 'There was no reason for the owners of the horses and the yard to think the threats were anything other than very real indeed, bearing in mind what had happened.' Geoghegan was traced to her home by police using the IP address of the computer used to send the messages. Geoghegan sobbed as Judge Parker said she had tried to deny blackmail with a tissue of lies. 'When confronted you not only denied it but came up with a fantasy and tissue of lies. 'All of which you later admitted was simply untrue.' Judge Christopher Parker QC accepted there was no evidence Geoghegan had been involved in the initial attack and she had been motivated by spite and greed Mrs Lee believes Geoghegan was behind the attack at the yard before the blackmail messages which she described as horrific Paramjit Ahluwalia, for Geoghegan, argued she was suffering from mental illness and heavily medicated at the time the messages were sent. Judge Parker QC did not accept the condition explained her course of action. After hearing Ms Ahulwalia, he asked: 'Why did she do it?' Sentencing Geoghegan to 15 months with a 12 month supervision order following her release, Judge Parker QC said: 'It is said you were suffering from some mental fragility, none of which seem to excuse or explain this course of action. 'I recognise that you have some personal inadequacies and mental fragility. 'Those medical professionals concluded you have nothing which requires treatment under the mental health act,' he said.
