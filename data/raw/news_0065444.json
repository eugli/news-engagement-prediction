Source: Tweet \nThe country's high court confirmed on Monday (Tuesday AEDT) that the Brazil forward's final appeal against the prosecution proceeding has been rejected. \nAppeals against the prosecution from Barca, Neymar's former club Santos and the company run by his parents were also turned down. \nThe charges relate to the 25-year-old's transfer to Camp Nou from Santos in 2013, with Brazilian investment group DIS alleging it received less money than the 40 per cent it was entitled to from the disputed transfer fee. \nProsecutors want a two-year prison sentence for Neymar and his father, although as they are first-time offenders it would be unlikely to result in jail time. \nThey are also seeking fines of $13 million against the Neymars, as well as amounts of $11.7 million and $9.1 million from Barcelona and Santos respectively. Barcelona court closes Neymar case The complaint raised against Neymar and Barcelona by club socio Jordi Cases has been closed by the provincial court, the club have said.
