Watch video Veeram song We Will Rise: Kunal Kapoor song is powerful but video is a big dampener. Watch video Veeram is an Indian adaptation of Shakespearean play Macbeth. This is Kunal Kapoor's first Malayalam film. By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Published:February 21, 2017 11:28 am Veeram is Kunal Kapoor‚Äôs first Malayalam film. \nThe Oscar-nominated song We Will Rise from Veeram is out. Kunal Kapoor, the lead actor of the Macbeth‚Äôs Indian adaptation, shared it on his Twitter handle. The song, which has been composed by Jeff Rona and sung by Kari Kimmel, is strong in its expression but loses some of its affect when seen with the video. We see Kunal Kapoor and his co-stars having a sword fight, which breaks the connect with the song. \nThe song, which has found a place in the Academy Awards‚Äô long list of 91 songs from eligible motion length pictures, leaves you in a trance. However, the visuals accompanying this soothing number are just distractions. Jeff Rona has also composed the music for movies like Phantom, God of Water, and Traffic III amongst others. While the song didn‚Äôt make it till the Oscar nomination stage, just being eligible was a first for a Indian film. Jeff, on knowing the news of his track being part of the Oscar long list, had tweeted. ‚ÄúJust being eligible is nice (it‚Äôs NOT a nomination!), but it‚Äôs a big thing in India!‚Äù \nMore from the world of Entertainment: \n\nWe are already quite impressed with how Kunal, known for his boy-next-door portrayals, has transformed himself into a warrior for the film. Even Amitabh Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan , who are family to Kunal, took to Twitter to praise the actor. Amitabh wrote, ‚ÄúVEERAM, directed by Jairaj, National Award winner .. Kunal Kapoor acting in the adaptation of Macbeth.‚Äù Abhishek tweeted, ‚ÄúLooking awesome @kapoorkkunal good luck jeejaji.‚Äù \nWatch | Veeram‚Äôs We Will Rise song : \n\nMany others including Karan Johar and Aamir Khan have been praising Kunal‚Äôs film. Veeram‚Äôs story revolves around the warrior Chandu Chekavar, played by Kunal, and his quest for power. \nRead the tweet here: T 2441 ‚Äì http://t.co/Y23l9d48iN ..
