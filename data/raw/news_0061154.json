Sumner Ohye , owner of the popular coffee shop, also has a location on the Mainland, near Seattle, that recently opened. Michelle Yokota and Sumner Ohye of The Curb coffee shop, which will open its fourth Oahu… more Courtesy The Curb His newest coffee shop, which he’s calling The Curb “Dream Bar,” is scheduled to open this summer around July at the Finance Factors-owned building in Kaimuki along Waialae Avenue. The Honolulu-based bank also has a branch in the building at 3408 Waialae Ave., which also includes such tenants as Breadshop and AT&T Wireless. The Curb’s new coffee shop will join Ohye’s existing smaller location that’s not too far away on Waialae Avenue. He told PBN that the plan to keep both Kaimuki locations open, with a planned re-branding for his original coffee shop. “If anyone wants to invest, we have some opportunities,” Ohye said. Last year, The Curb opened in the former Peet’s Coffee space in Kailua in Windward Oahu. The company, which started out at the curb in a coffee truck by the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine in Kakaako, also has a spot inside a cafe at the University of Hawaii Manoa campus. The coffee truck has since been sold. Ohye, a University of Washington alumnus, previously told PBN that he wanted a bigger location in Kaimuki and that Kapolei in West Oahu is another area that he’d like to open a coffee shop. The latter came true only for a short period of time, as The Curb opened temporarily at DeBartolo Development’s Macy’s-anchored Ka Makana Alii mixed-use shopping center in East Kapolei. The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf has since opened in that space at the West Oahu mall. Duane Shimogawa covers energy, commercial real estate and development for Pacific Business News.
