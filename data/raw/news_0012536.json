Gen. Chris Bogdan, F-35 program executive officer, called the contract a “good and fair” deal for taxpayers. \n“We continue to work with Industry to drive costs out of the program,” he said in a statement. \nTrump has surprised millions of Americans by keeping his word on virtually every single campaign promise. \n#WordsMatter \nJust two weeks in office and Trump is showing the world he’s a man of his word. \nThings are looking up!
