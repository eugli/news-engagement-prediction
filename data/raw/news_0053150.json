It does not affect the integrity of the overpass, Perez said.\nBut it does, however, take time to repair. Crews will cut until they have a sufficient area to remove all the damage, then reattach new rebar and pour concrete.\n\"We want to address it before the evening rush,\" Perez said. \"Once they do the cutting and get the concrete out they'll know if that's possible.\"\nCrews typically scout for potholes and other problems on highways and then schedule repairs for overnight periods when there is less traffic. Perez said this problem likely developed quickly overnight, and TxDOT simply couldn't wait.\n\"Once it starts to fail, you have multiple vehicles and it just grows,\" he said.\nCheck back later for more updates to this developing story.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/57/31/62/12426431/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/57/31/62/12426430/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/57/31/62/12426429/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/57/31/64/12426521/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/57/31/62/12426430/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/57/31/64/12426521/3/920x920.jpg", "https://twitter.com/TxDOTHoustonPIO", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/57/31/62/12426431/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/57/31/64/12426503/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/57/31/62/12426429/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/57/31/64/12426503/4/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-22T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:01:18.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
