The Bombers several times during the pre-season flagged a new forward role for the former skipper, but coach John Worsfold sent Watson straight into the guts last night — and it paid dividends. From the three quarters that he played, Watson finished with 19 touches, nine contested possessions, six clearances and four tackles before sitting the final term out on the bench. The cheer he received lining up for goal late in the second term said it all: Bombers fans are thrilled to have Jobe back. Jobe Watson finished with 19 disposals.

After shaking off some early tagging attention from Pies duo Jordan De Goey and Steele Sidebottom — he only had one touch in the first quarter — Heppell found more of the footy during the second and third terms, racking up 10 touches in the third quarter. The 24-year-old finished with 17 disposals and five clearances for the game before being placed in cotton wool for the fourth term alongside Watson. He’ll be better for the run. \nMichael Hurley \nOf the six returning players, Hurley was the one the Bombers took the most caution with. The All-Australian defender played out the first half, slotting into the back 50 to rack up seven disposals. Then he was taken off for the second half of the game — which had been the club’s intention all along — and placed in the club tracksuit, even though Hurley insisted he wanted to “play another 10 minutes”, according to Worsfold. Hurley was then seen post-game with ice on his ankle — an injury he is on the mend from. But Hurley told his coach that his ankle felt “brilliant” after the game and that the ice was only precautionary as he continues his recovery. \nTravis Colyer \nWatson was the clear standout of the returning Bombers, but this small forward wasn’t far behind him. As a member of the club’s new-look and exciting “mosquito fleet”, Colyer impressed with his run and carry throughout the game. He booted two first-half goals and even though he only finished with nine disposals for the game, he finished with 225m gained for the night — ranked fifth for the Bombers. Colyer’s tank and speed allows him to push onto the wing, but he did spend a lot of time inside the forward line on Thursday — potentially a dangerous prospect for rival clubs. Travis Colyer impressed with two goals.

Howlett had a slow start to the game, finishing the first term without a disposal to his name. But he took a strong contested mark inside 50 to convert a goal in the second quarter, before pushing more into the middle to rack up six touches for the third term. Still plenty of time to prove himself to Worsfold as a member of the club’s 2017 starting line-up. \nDavid Myers \nHe didn’t get a lot of the footy, but the on-baller made most of his touches count. Of Myers’ eight possessions, 75 per cent of them hit the target and 50 per cent of them turned into scores. At his best, the 27-year-old is a crucial member of the Bombers’ best line-up, as his height and aerobic capacity allow him to play in a variety of roles. The advantage he has over the likes of Howlett, Hocking and Stanton is that he has a few more tricks up his sleeve. \nThe returning Bombers who didn’t play \nHeath Hocking: The on-baller was picked as an emergency, but didn’t make the final cut. He’ll get a run in one — or both — of the next two pre-season games. \nCale Hooker: The defender-cum-forward missed Thursday night’s clash with a hamstring issue. Worsfold said it was doubtful the club would pick Hooker for the club’s second JLT game, but would more likely be available for the Bombers’ last pre-season game against Geelong in Bendigo. Most importantly, Worsfold said Hooker would be right for Round 1 of the real stuff. \nBrent Stanton: The aerobic beast was sidelined on Thursday night with a groin injury, however he’s expected to filter back in either the second or third JLT game. \nTom Bellchambers: Of the 10, the ruckman is in the most doubt for Round 1, but will still be given every chance to play. Bellchambers is unlikely to feature in any of the pre-season games after undergoing knee surgery in January. View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
