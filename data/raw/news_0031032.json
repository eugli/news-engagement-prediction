However, their latest video might be their best one yet. \nFor \"Beauty and Lord Voldemort ,\" the Norwegian sketch comedy duo have seamlessly blended footage from the upcoming Beauty and the Beast live-action film with footage from Warner Bros.' Harry Potter film franchise. They make it appear as though Hermoine/Belle (Emma Watson) falls head-over-heels in love with the beastly Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). \nBeauty and the Beast is the fantastic journey of Belle, a bright, beautiful and independent young woman who is taken prisoner by a beast in his castle. Despite her fears, she befriends the castle’s enchanted staff and learns to look beyond the Beast’s hideous exterior and realize the kind heart and soul of the true Prince within. The film stars: Emma Watson as Belle; Dan Stevens as the Beast; Luke Evans as Gaston, the handsome, but shallow villager who woos Belle; Oscar winner Kevin Kline as Maurice, Belle’s eccentric, but lovable father; Josh Gad as Lefou, Gaston’s long-suffering aide-de-camp; Golden Globe nominee Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, the candelabra; Oscar nominee Stanley Tucci as Maestro Cadenza, the harpsichord; Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Plumette, the feather duster; six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe, the wardrobe; Oscar nominee Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, the mantel clock; and two-time Academy Award winner Emma Thompson as the teapot, Mrs. Potts. \nBeauty and the Beast will be released in U.S. theaters on March 17, 2017. \nMORE : Celine Dion Recording New Beauty And The Beast Song / New Beauty And The Beast Poster / Emma Watson Turned Down A Different Disney Princess Role --- \nHave you seen LEGO Batman yet?
