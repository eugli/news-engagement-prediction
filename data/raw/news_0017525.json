Via @Bakersfieldcali https://t.co/kXZ7woYIKP \nIt sprouted from his lower abdomen more than a decade ago. \nDoctors told him: “You’re just fat, it’s just fat,” Logan told KERO-TV in Bakersfield. \nThe tumor grew so massive that it hung to the floor when he sat. \n“I used to equate it, you just put a strap around your neck and carry three bags of cement around with you all day long, just swinging,” Logan said. \nVirtually unable to move, he spent most of his time in a recliner in one room of his home. \nBy the time the tumor reached 130 to 140 pounds, doctors told Logan it was too risky for him to have surgery, giving him only a 50 percent chance of surviving it. \nBut his wife, Kitty, scoured the country for specialists to perform the operation and found Dev, who had performed similar surgeries. \n“She just kept pushing,” Logan told the Californian. “She wouldn’t let me quit.” \nLogan finally made the 2,000-mile, 40-hour trip to Central California with his chair bolted to the floor of a cargo van, “just like I was in my living room at home,” Logan told the paper. \nLogan is now recovering and last Thursday he was able to walk for practically the first time in years. \n“My feet are together,” Logan said, wiggling his toes in his hospital bed. “They haven’t been together in years.” \nHe is looking forward to returning home and resuming his life, out of an armchair. \n(Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
