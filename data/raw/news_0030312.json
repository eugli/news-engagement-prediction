Sawa called animal control and blamed Jeb. Animal control took the big dog into custody. \n\nDistrict Judge Michael Hulewicz ruled in September that Jeb was a \"dangerous dog\" and ordered him to be euthanized. \n\nOn September 19, the judge said Jeb met the legal definition of a dangerous animal, ruling that the dog should be \"destroyed.\" \n\nThat was when the Job family asked to have testing done to see whether Jeb's DNA matched the DNA in Vlad's wound. \n\nIn a stroke of good luck for Jeb, it came out that Vlad's body was still kept in a freezer by the grieving Sawa family. \n\nThe Jobs family then arranged to have swabs taken from Vlad's wound and the inside of Jeb's cheek. \n\nOn October 24, exactly two months after Jeb was taken into custody, AnnMarie Clark, a forensic DNA analyst at the Maples Center for Forensic Medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine, sent in her findings: The DNA in the wound did not match Jeb's DNA. \n\n\"Jeb is not the dog that killed (Vlad),\" Clark wrote. \n\n\"We were relieved. We were absolutely relieved,\" said Penny, Ken's wife. \n\nJeb was allowed to go home the week after the DNA results came in. \n\nJobs say Jeb came home a very different dog. \n\nThey say that during his nine weeks in animal control, he went from 41 to 34 kilogrammes, and he became scared and skittish. \n\nMeanwhile, Vlad's real killer is still on the loose, officials in Michigan were quoted as saying by local media.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T09:24:45.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
