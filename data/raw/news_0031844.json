I’m very happy with the one that both parties like.” \n“I can live with either one. I thought for a while that two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two,” Trump said. “But honestly, if Bibi [Netanyahu] and the Palestinians, if Israel and the Palestinians are happy ― I’m happy with the one they like the best.” \nTrump’s comments could be an indication of a major change in U.S. policy. For almost two decades, Democratic and Republican presidents alike have sought to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a two-state solution. \nThe president’s remarks were not entirely unforeseen, however. On Tuesday, a top White House official told Reuters that the administration would let the Israelis and the Palestinians decide whether a solution to the conflict would take the form of a separate Palestinian state. \nTrump also appeared to walk back his campaign promise to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \n“I’d love to see that happen,” Trump said of the move. “We’re looking at it very strongly. We’re looking at it with great care.” \nThis story is developing. Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post? Here’s how.
