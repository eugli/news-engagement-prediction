Reviewing their merit and making edits is part of the regular rhythm of our business.\"\nWASHINGTON AND THE WORLD \nJared Kushner’s Mission Impossible By Annie Karni \nTrump also tweeted Saturday about his day of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\"Playef golf today with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and @TheBig_Easy, Ernie Els, and had a great time.
