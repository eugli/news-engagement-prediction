Protesters outside Salford Civic Centre (Photo: Dominic Salter) \nHe announced an extra £170,000 will be put into Salford’s credit union to tackle the scourge of loan sharks and payday lenders; £300,000 to support low-income residents in ‘crisis’; £70,000 for welfare rights and debt advice services; £10,000 extra for women suffering domestic abuse and violence; £33,000 to heat poor people’s homes; and £300,000 for youth services. \nMr Dennett said the extra money was a ‘drop in the ocean’ considering the scale of the city’s poverty problem. \nLast week, the M.E.N. revealed that almost a quarter of the city’s children are living in poverty.

But Mr Dennett still managed to find an extra £300,000 to keep Salford’s streets clean. \nBefore the meeting, protesters gathered outside Salford Civic Centre to protest against cuts.

The families of disabled children also pleaded for a doomed care home to be saved. \nMr Dennett’s first budget plan revolved around finding efficiencies, bringing in extra cash and reducing costs. Nearly £2m will be saved through the council’s link-up with NHS chiefs. Salford Mayor, Paul Dennett \nDespite Labour’s attempts to protect frontline services, some cuts - including to public health - were unavoidable. \nA 4.99 per cent council tax rise was also agreed. Some 3 pc of that will be ringfenced to prop up the city’s hard-hit social care services, which face a £2.3m black hole next year. \nBut the extra cash, bosses say, will ‘barely scratch the service’. Unison branch secretary Steve North and protesters outside Salford Civic Centre (Photo: Dominic Salter) \nCuts in Salford have now hit nearly £200m since 2010 - the equivalent of £64,000 being wiped from the books EVERY DAY. \nSome 200 care packages for those with special needs have been axed; 11 children’s centres shut; £1.2m taken from services for the homeless and elderly; work and skills support cash cut by 80 per cent; four youth centres closed; and nearly £20m taken out of children’s services - a 30 per cent reduction per head.

Rebecca Howarth is leading the campaign to save the Grange care home (Photo: Dominic Salter) \n“The government isn’t interested in Salford, so clearly, we have to do things for ourselves. \n“The government has slashed our budgets, caused a collapse in vital services and now expect people to pay more in council tax to cover the crisis in social care costs. \n“Austerity and local government cuts are not working. Hunger and destitution has shockingly become the norm in Salford, as has debt and poverty. \n“We find ourselves in dire circumstances. Budget pressures are immense and the decisions we take are getting tougher and tougher. \n“But we will continue to fight for a better, fairer Salford.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:22:05.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
