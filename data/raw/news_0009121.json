Cal students should leave the area immediately. #miloatcal \n— UC Police, Berkeley (@UCPD_Cal) February 2, 2017 \nYiannopoulos, a Breitbart News editor, called into \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\", and told Carlson that college liberals have a \"big free speech problem\" and that they \"hate any libertarian or conservative\" viewpoint. \nHe said that shortly after he arrived at the facility at which he was to speak, other people began arriving in black clothes and masks. \nRocks were thrown, the ground floor of the building was \"breached\" and my private security evacuated me, Yiannopoulos said. \nHe pointed out the perceived irony that such a massive protest that tamped down on his free speech rights happened on an American college campus where \"we should be able to hear all [sides].\" \n\"I am not a scary far-right neo-Nazi,\" he said., \"the left is now acting like a dog that has just been kicked and knows it is about to get another one to the head.\" \n\"The left is profoundly antithetical to free speech these days, does not want to hear alternative points of view,\" he added. \nCarlson pointed out that the protesters were able to \"speak\" but Yiannopoulos, who came specifically to speak, was not allowed to. \nWatch footage of the protests above, and share your reaction in the comments.
