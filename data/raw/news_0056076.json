Travel. \nUnder current legislation, however, hotels in the UK and Scotland are not required to publicly display ratings, unlike in Wales and Northern Ireland. \nAmong the under-achieving hotels were London's five-star Royal Horseguards in Westminster and four-star Novotel in Birmingham. \nBoth received a hygiene rating of just two, with Novotel's rating being for \"high-risk food... out of temperature control\". \nThe worst ratings included four-star Copthorne Hotel in Birmingham, which scored one, where inspectors discovered raw meat stored next to sauces in a fridge as well as out-of-date seafood. \nBest Western's Dean Court Hotel in York, which boasts two AA Rosettes, was also awarded a one rating for food hygiene. 652 hotels, B&Bs and guesthouses in the UK have poor food hygiene Credit: PA \nWhich? Travel sent undercover researchers to eight hotels in London, Birmingham and Northumberland with a food hygiene rating of between zero and two, finding that not one visibly displayed its rating at the time of the visit. \nHotels, B&Bs or guesthouses are not currently required to publicly display ratings, but Which? are calling for this to be made mandatory. \nThe FSA is currently contemplating such a scheme. \nWhich? Travel editor Rory Boland said: \"Around nine in 10 of us eat at least one meal in our overnight accommodation so it's vital that hotels, B&Bs and guesthouses have high standards of food hygiene. \n\"We know that displaying the rating outside the premises encourages higher standards, which is why we support the FSA case for a compulsory display scheme for the whole of the UK.\" The FSA wants to make displaying food hygiene ratings mandatory Credit: PA ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:07:14.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
