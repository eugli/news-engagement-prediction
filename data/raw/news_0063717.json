She says she was wearing a headscarf, styled as a hijab. \nLohan said she wore the scarf out of respect to Turkish people and to hide her identity. \n“When I was flying to New York recently. I was wearing a headscarf and I got stopped at the airport and was racially profiled for the first time in my life,” she told Good Morning Britain on Tuesday. “What scared me was that moment, how would another woman who doesn’t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel?
