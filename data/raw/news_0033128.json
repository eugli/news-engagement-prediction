Shuqat Ali, who has been jailed for two years and four months for his role in a drugs gang \nThe gang have now been sentenced at Preston Crown Court after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs.

Nasar Ali, who has been jailed for six years and eight months for his role in a drugs gang \nBut the court heard this value was a ‘conservative estimate’ and in all likelihood the value was far greater. \nThe gang travelled from their homes in Cheetham Hill, Crumpsall and Levenshulme to Blackburn, then sent out block text messages advertising the drugs and letting users know they were in town and open for business. Lukman Majeed, who has been jailed for for his role in a drugs gang \nCustomers would place orders and meet the gang in their car at meeting points across Blackburn town centre. \nOfficers went undercover as drug addicts on a number of occasions to meet with the gang, to buy drugs and collect evidence. \nJudge Robert Altham praised the officers for their work. Mohammed Rahman, who has been jailed for four years and eight months for his part in a drugs gang \nHe said: “One needs to commend the considerable bravery of those who carry out work such as this. \n“This was pro-active selling, pushing of class A drugs, not simply waiting for the users to come to them but making sure the users knew they were in the area and had these dangerous drugs to sell.” \nThe court heard that Nasar Ali, from Cheetham Hill, boasted he was the head of the operation with the other men working on his orders. \nShuqar Ali said he was only involved as the driver and would ferry the men between Manchester and Blackburn.

(And when will it go away!) \nBut Judge Altham said: “Drug dealers, in order to ply their trade, need a vehicle and often they need a driver. \n“Mr Ali, regrettably, decided to involve himself in that role. He drove drug dealers around, knowing what they were doing.” \nNasar Ali, 29, of Cheetham Hill Road, Cheetham Hill, who has two previous drug trafficking convictions as well as convictions for violence, was jailed for six years and eight months, with a separate four month concurrent sentence for possession of class A drugs on a separate occasion. \nMohammed Rahman, 31, of Caremine Avenue, Levenshulme, was jailed for four years and eight months. \nLukman Majeed, 31, of Broomfield Drive, Cheetham Hill, was jailed for five years and eight months. \nShuqat Ali, 39, of Rectory Road, Crumpsall, was jailed for two years and four months.
