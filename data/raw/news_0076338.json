And no, it’s not THAT jersey, so feel cross him off the list of suspects . \nSherman posted an Instagram picture of his collection of game-worn jerseys exchanged with other NFL players, and included was a home jersey of the New England Patriots quarterback. \nThe sleeve of an Odell Beckham, Jr. jersey obstructs Brady’s full message to Sherman, but from what we can see, it says, “RS – I’M STILL … YOU ARE THE BEST!” A post shared by Richard Sherman (@rsherman25) on Feb 25, 2017 at 11:46am PST \nBrady is 1-2 in his career against the Seahawks since Sherman was drafted in 2011. Of course, that win was in Super Bowl XLIX. Brady and Sherman shook hands after that game. \nSherman caused a stir after the Seahawks beat the Patriots in 2012, when he posted a picture of him and Brady on Twitter with the caption “U MAD BRO?” Sherman intercepted Brady in that game. \nSherman publicly supported Brady in the quarterbacks’ battle against the NFL over Deflategate. \nThumbnail photo via Mark J.
