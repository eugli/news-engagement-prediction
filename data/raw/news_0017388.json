A source said there was “no truth at all” to the claims. \nShadow home secretary Diane Abbott was expected to fall into line after being mocked by colleagues for missing last week’s vote with a migraine. A source said: “We think Diane has bought a packet of ibuprofen.” \nA rebellion by London Labour MPs who are opposed to Brexit looked likely to grow. Two more, Seema Malhotra and Jim Fitzpatrick, were considering defying the whips. \nTheresa May was confident that the Government would cruise to victory in the third reading of the Bill, empowering her to trigger Article 50 and begin Brexit. \nMr Lewis was called to a private one-to-one meeting in Mr Corbyn’s Commons office last night, the Standard learned, after he gave a clear signal in an earlier shadow cabinet meeting that he was prepared to rebel. \nBut it was clear today that Mr Lewis had not made up his mind. \nA terse Mr Corbyn refused to give interviews to reporters outside his north London home this morning. \nIn comments that will make it hard for Mr Lewis to avoid rebelling and resigning, the MP said: “It’s my intention to do what’s right by my constituents and my conscience. It’s a really tough call.” \nA fellow shadow cabinet member told the Standard that Mr Lewis was “very unpredictable” and seemed to be struggling with the competing pressures. \nAmong those was a clear sense that he would not receive Mr Corbyn’s support in any future leadership contest if he rebelled tonight. \nMr Lewis is believed to be assessing his own chances as a future leader from the Left. His departure would be the fourth shadow cabinet resignation in a week, but by far the most senior.
