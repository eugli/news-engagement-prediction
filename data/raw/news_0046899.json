Article continues below \nAfter it emerged that a bookmaker had offered odds of 8/1 for Shaw to eat a pie on camera, he now finds himself under investigation for potentially breaching betting rules. \nAnd having decided that his position at Gander Green Lane has been made untenable by events of the past 24 hours, his resignation has been accepted by the U’s and he subsequently finds himself unemployed.

Shaw reveals what it'll take for Arsenal to sign him \nHe appeared on Good Morning Britain earlier on Tuesday and ended up issuing a come-and-get-me-plea to Arsene Wenger. \nAsked by Piers Morgan what it’ll take for him to sign on the dotted line for the Gunners, Shaw was unequivocal with his response. \n“I think two more than the two [pasties] you’ve got there!” \nThis made Piers, a passionate Arsenal fan, burst out laughing. \n“So let me just clarify,” the journalist responded, “for six Cornish pasties, you will sign for Arsenal?” \n“Definitely,” Shaw replied. \nSkip to 1.15 to watch the funny clip… Cech and Ospina shouldn't worry too much \nShould Petr Cech and David Ospina worry? Probably not. \nEven though Cech is six years older than Ospina, at 34 he’s still a baby compared to Shaw. \nWe fear the big man’s playing career could well be over after today’s turn of events. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
