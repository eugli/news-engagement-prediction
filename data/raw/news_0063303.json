we may know that that is a nonsense in the real world.\n\"Sadly, that does not stop it necessarily happening.\"\nThe dramatic statement came in Sir Ivan's second grilling by MPs since he quit his post in Brussels with a blast at \"muddled thinking\" over Brexit.\nIn the first he warned talks will be \"humongous\", could end in a giant divorce bill and be something like a \"fist-fight\".\nSir Ivan said the issue of money, including a £50bn 'divorce', is likely to get \"gory\" (Photo: Getty) Sir Ivan also warned that the EU is unlikely to agree specific deals for industries like car manufacturing - and German Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly said \"no sectoral interest will be put above the general interest\".\n\"With Merkel - if she's still there - the unity of the 27 will win out and I think she and others will agree that there will be no sectoral deal\", he said.\nSir Ivan said the issue of money, including reports of a £50bn 'divorce' settlement, is likely to get \"gory\".\nHe said \"the key players, the key officials, the key technocrats, the key theologians\" think a new relationship may not be agreed until 2022 even if negotiations proceed \"unprecedentedly fast\".\nAnd before that deal is struck, European countries may want to keep hold of \"British dosh\" during a transition period to avoid a squeeze on the Brussels budget.\n European Union Theresa May Angela Merkel Brexit Divorce Public services Politics", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorPolitics", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "http://i1.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article9851479.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/JS110647558.jpg", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://i1.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article9851479.ece/ALTERNATES/s508/JS110647558.jpg", "http://i1.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article9851479.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/JS110647558.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-22T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:53:50.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
