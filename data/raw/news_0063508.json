Both Michael’s former Wham! bandmate Andrew Ridgeley and backup singers Pepsi & Shirlie were on hand to give emotional speeches dedicated to their late friend. “A supernova in a firmament of shining stars had been extinguished and it felt like the sky had fallen in,” Ridgeley said of learning of Michael’s death on Christmas. “We always knew George was destined to become a star in his own right,” Pepsi noted, fighting back tears. The trio were there to introduce Coldplay’s Chris Martin, who performed “A Different Corner” in memory of Michael. Though, really, it’s Michael who sang his own tribute: After playing old interview footage of Michael, Martin did a posthumous duet with Michael using audio from the song’s video. Because no one can do Michael justice better than himself.\n\nTags: george michael tributes chris martin wham! pepsi & shirlie Chris Martin ‘Duets’ With George Michael in BRITs Tribute Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories George Clooney Wants to Remind You That Trump and Bannon Are Hollywood Elitists Rachel Bloom and Adam Pally Will Star in a ‘ Rear Window for Stoners’ Comedy Chris Brown Ordered to Stay Away From Ex Karrueche Tran Following Death Threats Most Viewed Stories Why Was Times Theater Critic Charles Isherwood Fired?
