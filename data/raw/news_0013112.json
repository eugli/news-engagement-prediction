Credit: AP/Marcio Jose Sanchez \nThe US Justice Department has formally appealed a ruling by a judge in Seattle which suspended President Trump's travel ban. \nThe government's request for an emergency stay was filed on Saturday night with the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals. \nThe filing asks the court to lift an order from a judge in Washington state. \nOn Friday, Seattle District Judge James Robart imposed a nationwide restraining order on the president's executive order which affected people from seven mainly Muslim nations. \nRobart's decisions went against government lawyers who argued that individual states did not have the right to challenge the directive. Favourite \nBut his ruling has been heavily criticised by Mr Trump on Twitter where he has posted several messages questioning the decision and claiming that it will have negative ramifications for the safety and security of the US. \nIn one tweet Mr Trump asked: \"What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?\" Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson challenged the ban in court. Credit: AP/Ted S. Warren/File \nIn another message on Twitter Mr Trump also questioned his own lawyers. \nHe wondered why they were not looking at a decision, also made on Friday by a federal judge in Boston, who ruled against extending a temporary restraining order on the ban in Massachusetts that was set to expire on February 5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:41:21.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
