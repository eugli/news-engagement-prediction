Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nBelieve it or not, the same press that launched a Twitter hashtag campaign Friday in response to another “fake news” tweet from President Donald Trump weren’t fans of his rally Saturday afternoon in Melbourne, Fla., although the crowd certainly seemed to be into it. \nTo be honest, there wasn’t much to distinguish the rally from a campaign event, but President Obama campaigned for a full eight years, so that’s nothing new either. There's dust on Trump's speech it's so old. \n— Roger Simon (@politicoroger) February 18, 2017 \nWe’ve got to agree for the most part, although if you ignore most of the speech and just focus on the most important parts — Trump’s digs at the media and the media’s response — it was still pretty fresh. Crowd at Trump rally boos media at encouragement of Diamond & Silk. Now chanting \"CNN Sucks\" \n— Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) February 18, 2017 Guy walking past press pen at Trump rally stops and repeatedly shouts at reporters, \"FAKE NEWS!\" I've missed this. \n— McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) February 18, 2017 Enemy here at Trump rally is clearly the media. Every speaker bashing press to crowd. People yelling \"fake news\" outside press pen. \n— Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) February 18, 2017 During the 2016 election, a central rallying point for Trump supporters was a hatred of Hillary Clinton. This rally? Hatred of the media. \n— Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna) February 18, 2017 Trump goes to Melbourne to rally his supporters and trash the media. He is founding his presidency on hatred of the press. \n— Neil King (@NKingofDC) February 18, 2017 Trump, at his Florida rally, is telling the crowd about Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson fighting with the media \n— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 18, 2017 Translated loosely to \"pay no attn to reports on my calling media the 'enemy' as line-crossing\" https://t.co/RhXmmLELxG \n— Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) February 18, 2017 The president of the United States is using a campaign rally to attack the free press.
