Associated Press Updated December 02, 2016 . \nDarlie Routier is on death row in Texas, convicted of the murder of one of her two sons , Devon and Damon Routier, who were killed in the early morning of June 6, 1996. The media coverage of the murder investigation depicted Routier as another heartless mother whose children were getting in the way of her lifestyle, so she killed them for money. \nThat's also how books such as Precious Angels by Barbara Davis, and the prosecutors at her trial portrayed Darlie Routier. Most found it believable in the aftermath of the Susan Smith case two years earlier. \nSince her conviction, Darlie and her family have learned a whole lot more about the legal system and have presented a far different picture than was originally shown by the press. Even Barbara Davis changed her mind about the case and added a chapter to her book disputing the prosecutor's case. \nRead both sides and decide for yourself if this young woman is the she-devil portrayed by the prosecutors and press, or a woman naive of the inner workings of the legal system. Darlie and Darin Routier \nDarlie and Darin Routier were high-school sweethearts who married in August 1988, after Darlie completed high-school. By 1989, they had their first boy, Devon Rush, and in 1991, Damon Christian, their second son was born \nAs their family grew, so did Darin's computer-related business and the family moved to an affluent area known as Dalrock Heights Addition in Rowlett, Texas. Life was going well for the Routiers and they celebrated their successes by surrounding themselves with expensive items such as a new Jaguar, a cabin cruiser, lush furnishings, jewelry and clothing. \nAfter a few years of living an affluent lifestyle, Darin's business began to falter and with it came financial problems for the couple. Rumors began that the couple's relationship was in trouble and there was talk of extramarital affairs. Friends said Darlie, obsessed with her appearance, reportedly had little patience for the children . Despite the rumors, on October 18, 1995 the couple had their third son Drake, after which Darlie experienced postpartum depression. \nDesperate to lose the weight she had gained during pregnancy she began taking diet pills which failed to help and contributed to her mood swings. She confided to Darin about having suicidal thoughts and the two began talking and reviewing their future. Things were looking fixable for the young couple. But with this hopeful period was cut short by a tragedy that no one could have predicted. The Murder of Devon and Damon \nAround 2:30 in the morning on June 6, 1996, the Rowlett Police received an emergency call from the Routier home. Darlie was screaming that she and her two boys had been stabbed by an intruder and her boys were dying. Darin Routier, awakened by the Darlie's screams, ran down the stairs into the family room, where just hours before he had left his wife and two sons lying by the television. Now, as he entered, all he saw was the blood-soaked bodies of his two sons and his wife. \nDarin tried to save Devon, who was not breathing. As reported by Barbara Davis, \"Torn between two sons, the horrified father momentarily panicked, then made the decision to begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the son who was not breathing. Darin placed his hand over Devon's nose and breathed into his child's mouth. Blood sprayed back onto the father's face.\" Damon, with deep gashes in his chest, struggled for air. \nThe house filled with paramedics and police. The paramedics began trying to save the children as the police searched the home for the intruder who Darlie said had run in the direction of the attached garage. Policeman David Waddell and Sergeant Matthew Walling noted a bloody knife on the kitchen counter, Darlie's purse and expensive jewelry lying near it, a slash in the screen of a window in the garage, and splattered blood on the floor. \nThe medics were unable to save either child . The knife thrusts left deep gashes in the boys' chests and punctured their lungs. Gasping for air, they both suffered horrible deaths . Darlie's wounds—more superficial and not life threatening—were temporarily patched up while Darlie told the police of the horrific events that unfolded just an hour earlier.
