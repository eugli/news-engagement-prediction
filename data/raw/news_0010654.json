Mayor followed sister city visit rules: CEO \nThe SAT also heard from former City of Perth chief executive Frank Edwards. \nHe was quizzed about other trips taken by the Lord Mayor to Perth sister cities, and whether the Lord Mayor should have made disclosures beyond those made by her. \nMr Edwards said specific policies surrounding sister city visits had been followed. \nThe action by the Department of Local Government (DLG) comes after a damning report from the Corruption and Crime Commission in November 2015 . \nThe CCC investigated the $US36,000 trip Ms Scaffidi took to the Beijing Olympics, and found she had \"failed in her duties\" by not disclosing the funds in her annual return, along with other gifts and travel. \nThat report prompted an inquiry by the director-general of the DLG, which found Ms Scaffidi failed to properly disclose gifts and contributions on multiple occasions between January 2008 and October 2015. \nThat highly critical report recommended she be referred to the SAT. \nMs Scaffidi, who has been on the council since 2000, has repeatedly refused to stand down , saying her failure to properly disclose gifts was the result of flawed City of Perth guidelines and policies.
