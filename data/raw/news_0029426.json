And that was only the beginning: Joy Villa’s “Make America Great Again” dress. She succeeded in causing a stir with a star-spangled red, white, and blue #MAGA gown, replete with “Trump” train. But Vogue.com Culture editor Alessandra Codinha may have said it best when she tweeted of Villa: https://twitter.com/ATCodinha/status/830908626869092353 Jennifer Lopez’s call to action. For anyone worried that the Grammys, or awards season, might feel futile during our tense political clime, J.Lo argued for the importance of art and music. “At this particular point in history, our voices are needed more than ever,” she said before presenting Best New Artist to Chance the Rapper. “As Toni Morrison once said, this is precisely the time when artists go to work…. There is no time for despair, no place for self pity, no need for silence, and no room for fear. We do language, that is how civilizations heal.” James Corden’s allusion to the president. Because no 2017 awards show opener is complete without a Trump reference. Corden’s came in his (deft!) opening rap: “Live it all up because this is the best, and with President Trump we don’t know what comes next… We sit here tonight no matter our race or where we were born or color of face, using this art remember forever we can survive by sticking together.“ Paris Jackson’s Dakota Access Pipeline shout-out. After making her Grammys red-carpet debut, Michael Jackson’s daughter made her voice heard. “We can really use this excitement at a Pipeline protest , guys,” Jackson, 18, said while presenting a performance by The Weeknd and Daft Punk. “#NoDAPL.” Beyoncé’s inspiring acceptance speech. Okay, so there was nothing explicitly political about Queen Beyoncé’s powerful acceptance for Best Urban Contemporary Album for Lemonade . But her presence was so powerful and uplifting that it sparked calls that she should run for president. “It’s important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first through their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House, and the Grammys, and see themselves, and have no doubt that they’re beautiful, intelligent, and capable,” she said, from behind her glittering veil. “This is something I want for every child of every race.” #Beyonce2020—who’s in? A Tribe Called Quest’s anti-Trump performance. Q-Tip kicked it off with a promise to fans (who were already flipping out at the rare live appearance by the rap legends): “Those people who are pushing people in power to represent them...tonight, we represent you.” But the Tribe didn’t stop there, blasting “President Agent Orange for perpetuating all of that evil that you‘ve been perpetuating throughout the United States.” The band also called out the “Muslim ban” before launching into their new track, “We the People.” Katy Perry’s “Persist” armband—and entire performance. Perry literally wore her resistance on her sleeve, with an apparent nod to Mitch McConnell’s comments on shutting down Elizabeth Warren in the Senate this week: “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.” Really, Perry’s whole “Chained 2 the Rhythm” performance was a potent political statement: She also wore a Planned Parenthood button and a white pantsuit (an ode to the suffragettes’ chosen uniform?), walked through fences on stage (which some speculated was a reference to President Trump’s travel ban ), and projected “We the People“ onstage. She concluded by telling the crowd: “No hate.” Recommended For You", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:31:08.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
