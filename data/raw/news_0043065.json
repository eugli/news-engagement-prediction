Stay healthy!” \nThat task has proved challenging for Ryu in the last two... (Andy McCullough) \n“Lefties were our nemesis,” Ward said. “That’s no secret.” \nThe Dodgers appreciated his ability to take a walk, but his lack of foot speed and dormant strength offered room to grow. Aware of Grandal’s zeal for improvement, Roberts wanted to connect him with a hitting instructor living nearby in Arizona. On the recommendation of Andre Ethier, Roberts considered reaching out to Pentland. \nRoberts pitched the idea to Ward and to Andrew Friedman , the president of baseball operations. Because Ward lives in Alabama during the off-season, it made sense to put an experienced set of eyes on Grandal’s progress. Pentland coordinated with Ward, and talked with Grandal on the phone. The two agreed to meet at a cage near Grandal’s home in Peoria. A three-hour conversation established a base for the relationship. \nAfter a lengthy stint at Arizona State, Pentland coached with the Chicago Cubs, the Seattle Mariners and the Kansas City Royals before joining the Dodgers in 2008. He was fired amid the misery of 2011, but maintains a strong reputation around the sport. He commuted from Tempe to work with Grandal. \nPentland believes a hitter should emphasize his strengths rather than try to compensate for his weaknesses. Grandal can provide brute force, and his arms are short enough to create a compact swing, Pentland said. He preached to Grandal about finding balance, reducing the amount of body movement in his swing and focusing on “how to maneuver the hands and arms to square up baseballs,” he said. \nGrandal insisted that his philosophy was not dependent on where he was standing at the plate, as “my approach is always to attack,” he said. But Pentland felt Grandal “had some doubt” about handling pitches on the inner half as a right-handed hitter. He encouraged Grandal to move closer to the plate to reach those pitches. \nAs the weeks went by, they focused on efficiency. They debated strategies for situational hitting. Pentland gave Grandal DVDs of hitters like Ted Williams, Henry Aaron, Chipper Jones and Nolan Arenado to study what they had in common. \n“If you talk to Yaz, he wants to play in all 162 games,” Pentland said. “This guy has incredible desire. Very, very high standards for his performance. He’s the kind of guy you want on your ballclub.” \nGrandal will not play 162 games in 2017. His backup, Austin Barnes, is a right-handed hitter. But Roberts does not envision a platoon again this season. He envisions Grandal replicating his left-handed production from the other side of the plate. \n“His confidence right-handed,” Roberts said, “is through the roof right now.” Caption Dodgers FanFest: Take me out to the ball game \nSights and sounds from Saturday's Dodgers FanFest at Dodger Stadium. \nSights and sounds from Saturday's Dodgers FanFest at Dodger Stadium.
