Media caption Transgender rights activists protested near the White House against President Trump's decision on Wednesday \nIn an interview with ABC News , Juliet said she dealt with discrimination \"every day\", with people saying \"horrible things\" to her. \nShe said a situation where transgender students' rights over toilet use were unclear was \"unsafe\". \nMr Trump's move on Wednesday will have no immediate impact, because Mr Obama's directive has already been temporarily blocked by a judge in Texas . \nThe Obama directive sparked a backlash across the country, with legal challenges from 13 states. \nA letter sent by the Trump administration to US schools on Wednesday said the previous measure had caused confusion. Read more Viewpoint from a trans rights activist \nLast May, Mr Obama's justice and education departments instructed public schools to allow transgender students to use whichever bathroom corresponded to their gender identity. \nThough not legally binding, Mr Obama's order warned schools they could lose funding if they did not follow the new guidance. \nThe Obama administration's policy was based on its interpretation of Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education. Mr Obama argued that protection extended to gender identity. 'Intimate spaces' \nDuring his presidential campaign, Mr Trump said transgender students should be allowed to use whichever bathroom \"they feel is appropriate\". \nBut he reversed his stance after facing Republican criticism. \nOn Wednesday, conservative activists praised Mr Trump's order, saying it protected student rights to privacy. \n\"Our daughters should never be forced to share private, intimate spaces with male classmates, even if those young men are struggling with these issues,\" said Vicki Wilson, a member of Students and Parents for Privacy. \n\"It violates their right to privacy and harms their dignity.\" \nBut the American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten called the move a major setback for transgender rights. \n\"By rescinding these protections, the Trump administration is compromising the safety and security of some of our most vulnerable children,\" she said. \n\"Reversing this guidance tells trans kids that it's OK with the Trump administration and the Department of Education for them to be abused and harassed at school for being trans.\" 'Privilege to perform' \nJackie Evancho told ABC she had not yet had a response from the president to her request for a meeting.

It's about human rights.\" Media caption \"My heart is a girl heart\" - Zoey's story \nAre you a transgender student who is affected by this decision?
