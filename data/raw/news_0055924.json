(Photo: Salwan Georges, Detroit Free Pres) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThree years ago, after listening to Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan use his first State of the City address to detail the seeming 1,001 things he wanted to accomplish, I wrote: “The first thing you want to ask Mayor Mike Duggan is: ‘You really think you can do all that stuff you just said?’ \n\"The second thing is: How can I help?” \nThis time, this year, people are less interested in the past or kept promises: working streetlights, improved bus transportation, hundreds of parks reopened, an enhanced national reputation. \nAll that mattered this year was: What comes next? \nSo after recognizing his City Council partners — something they must still be getting used to — he announced that he wouldn’t be talking about the past. \nRelated: \nKaffer: Duggan's priorities for Detroit are right, but challenges remain \n“We know we’ve got a long way to go,” he said. \nSo he announced the $30-million Neighborhood Strategic Fund, created from increasing donations from private investors, to focus the city’s attention on the neighborhoods, whose residents have felt left out of Detroit’s renaissance. \nAnd the crowd at Focus: HOPE’s Machinist Training Institute cheered. \nThen he announced that he was bringing back residential street sweeping. \nAnd the crowd cheered. \nThen he announced that he’d be reopening the shuttered 8th Precinct police station. \nAnd the crowd cheered. \nWhen Duggan says he’s going to do something, you just believe him. He wasn’t able to tackle the city’s car insurance problem as promised, as city residents pay a heinous rate nearly triple that of other cities. \nBut Duggan vowed to tackle it again as he faces re-election opposition from 25 candidates who have filed to replace him, including one with the famous name of Coleman Young II. And he announced a litany of programs that may as well have been campaign flyers: \n• A new program to train people for jobs that exist instead of employment in the abstract. People cheered. \nDuggan recalled one prison inmate’s reaction: He “stood up and said ‘I’m 25 years old and the first job training I’ve ever gotten in my life was here in prison.’ Now I wouldn’t recommend that to anyone else but it does seem odd that you have to go to prison to learn skills.” \n• Expansion of the Detroit Promise program from one that offers high school graduates tuition to two-year colleges to one that offers tuition to four-year colleges. \n“College will be available to any resident in the city of Detroit,” the mayor said. \"College will be one of the privileges of living in the city of Detroit.” \nDuggan did celebrate the historic — that “for the first time in more than 40 years, all of Detroit’s sports teams will be playing in the city” as the Pistons will join the Wings, Lions and Tigers downtown next season. \nBut for the most part his State of the City was all business, in which he made clear that he: \n• Strongly opposes the State Reform Office’s plan to close 25 Detroit schools. “A state emergency manager ran those schools,” he said. “We have 110,000 kids who need a quality seat in a school. Closing a school doesn’t add a quality seat.” \n• Strongly supports the city’s immigrant community. “Detroit will stand as a pro-immigration city. We’re not going to waver.” \n• Supports affordable housing all across the city. “There is no point being mayor of this city if you can’t stand up for people who are being pushed around.” \n• Supports reducing the cost of homeowner’s insurance. \n• Plans to hire more police and purchase more fire trucks. \nDuggan spent only a little time on home demolitions, the subject of federal scrutiny. But he made clear that as important as it is to demolish homes quickly, he plans to demolish homes in full compliance with all federal and state regulations. \n“The feds shut us down for 60 days last summer and they were right to do it,” he said, adding that his team created a new system that he pledged will find a way to “take down 10,000 buildings over the next 10 years.” \nThree years ago, Duggan didn’t drop ideas. He detailed jobs and attached a name or task force to every duty. He did it again Tuesday. \n“Mike has turned out to be one fine public servant,” Councilman George Cushingberry said before Duggan had uttered a word. “The culture has changed downtown. … The culture has changed, and that because Mike is there.” CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:00:56.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
