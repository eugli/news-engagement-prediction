She said their biggest beef with Trott and other Republicans is the possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act. \nRelated: Doing nothing on Obamacare is not an option \n“My daughter is now 31 and she's anticipating health problems all her life,” Horrigan-Happy said. “She has private insurance right now, but I’m concerned if the ACA goes away, they can eventually deny her coverage.” \nOrganized by a statewide political group called the Michigan People’s Campaign, the rally was complete with a loudspeaker, posters — even someone dressed in a chicken outfit to suggest Trott is “chicken” when it comes to meeting his constituents. According to one of the organizers, Trott hasn’t met directly with the voters of the 11th District in more than 600 days. \n“These people just want to meet with him and talk,” said Hank Wisner, 27, of Detroit, who was passing out fliers for the group.
