Credit: alamy Paul Bignell , travel writer 31 January 2017 • 5:31pm \n“You’re walking the Boiling Lake trail? Oh dear, oh my…” said our taxi driver, Margel Durand. It was becoming a familiar reaction among those told of my impending hike: the surprise, followed by a concerned shake of the head and then a faint, wry smile. \nI thought about these telltale traits next day as I sat, catching my breath on an outcrop overlooking the world’s second largest boiling lake, in the Morne Trois Pitons National Park on the island of Dominica . \nThe sight of a vast cauldron of bubbling, grey-blue water, 200ft across and partly obscured by vapour, was my reward after a four-hour trek. (Things haven’t got any better: since I visited, the Dominican government has urged visitors to avoid the Boiling Lake due to a change in water level.)

The route had taken me through verdant, damp rainforest to a plateau more than 3,000ft high, overlooking muscular ridges of tree canopies. \nEventually I arrived at a place called the Valley of Desolation – and for good reason. The volcanic crater, devoid of life, wouldn’t look out of place on a Star Trek set. \nI hopped past hissing fumarole vents and bubbling grey mud bubbles as the air hung heavy with sulphur, before climbing to an outcrop overlooking a misty, boiling lake. Not so bad, I thought, as I finished the last of my chicken sandwiches, feeling smug – and faintly relieved to have got there – as I enjoyed this quiet, almost unknown corner of the Caribbean. Fresh coconuts for sale in Dominica Credit: alamy \nDominica is one of the Windward Islands in the Lesser Antilles archipelago, sandwiched between two better-known French-influenced neighbours, Guadeloupe and Martinique. It has often been overlooked by tourists heading to the region, for two reasons: it has few white-sand beaches, and there is no international airport (British visitors fly to Antigua, then take a 30-minute flight with the local Caribbean airline Liat). \nJust 29 miles long and 16 miles wide, Dominica richly deserves its moniker “The Nature Island”. It boasts dozens of waterfalls, a mountainous interior, cloud forest, coastal woodland and nine active volcanoes. Welcome to the \"Nature Island\" Credit: alamy \nThe Boiling Lake trail is one of several well-kept paths, often with breathtaking views, that criss-cross the island. Of course it was a four-hour walk back to civilisation, turning my legs to jelly and testing my stamina. “Keep the blood pumpin’, movin’ and a groovin’ ” was the now slightly grating motivational mantra offered by my guide, bushman Peter Green. My blood had been pumping for the past eight miles, and I thought it might pump out through my temples. \nRemarkably for rainforest, there is nothing in Dominica that will kill you. Yes there are snakes, but even if you do encounter a boa constrictor, it will just give you a friendly “hug”, according to locals. \nIn fact, there is more danger in the flora – as I discovered when I plucked an innocuous-looking green berry from a beach and put it in my swim shorts pocket. “Can you throw that back in the water please, now,” pleaded Don, our captain, as I climbed back on the boat. The berry, I was told, contained cyanide and eating it could have been fatal. Natural remedies | The healing power of plants in Dominica \nIf adventure isn’t your style, there are plenty of opportunities for relaxation. The Indian River is a good place to start. Its slow-moving waters have an eerie stillness as you glide silently upstream in a rowing boat. \nYet there are excitements. Some 18 species of land crab pepper the twisted, serpentlike roots of the mangrove shoreline. Swamp blood trees, whose branches “bleed” red when snapped, hang overhead within touching distance; the island’s oldest indigenous tribe, the Kalinago people, use the tree’s dye for tattoos. \nBlue herons perch on distant semi-submerged logs, taking off to reveal their impressive wingspans, while tiny hummingbirds flit from one bright hibiscus flower to the next.

Stories abound of encounters with Johnny Depp or Orlando Bloom, and locals need no prompting to tell you about them. \nSherri, the American owner of the Bush Bar, is a case in point. As you sip her infamous (and potent) Dynamite rum, she will recount how Depp spent hours hanging out in the bar in between takes, enjoying that very rum. \nThe Bush Bar, like much of the island, felt incredibly quiet. In fact, with only 70,000 inhabitants who live mainly on the coast, Dominica can feel eerily deserted. If you take the risk and go at the beginning of the rainy season (June to November) you could find you have much of the island to yourself. \nTo unwind, visit the Papillote Wilderness Retreat – a beautiful nature garden born out of the destruction wrought in 1979 by Hurricane David, which felled most of the island’s trees in one catastrophic day. I took time to walk around the garden’s meandering footpath.

The garden also has natural waterfalls and warm thermal pools, plus several good-sized but basic rooms for those who want to stay there. \nFor the avid twitcher, there is an abundance of bird life at Papillote – 27 species, from the Antillean crested hummingbird and the yellow-striped bananaquit to the more common black and red bullfinch. The 10-acre site is also home to 19 species of butterfly. Marcel, the knowledgable gardener, lists the many plants and herbs with supposed medicinal properties, though few of the claims are backed up with scientific fact. \nOn the island’s north-west coast, the Syndicate walking trail offers further treats for birdwatchers. This is the best place to see the sisserou – a native parrot, depicted on Dominica’s national flag – and the smaller jaco, found at lower elevations. Meet the locals | Secret of a long life \nThe aptly named Dr Birdy guided me along the trail, pointing out wild cinnamon and nutmeg, coffee beans and at times sticking his hand under a rock in a freshwater stream to fish out tiny shrimp, or stopping to produce a giant stick insect from behind a bush. \nGiven all this, it is no surprise that there are no mega-resorts on Dominica. Accommodation is in lodges, guesthouses or a handful of small eco and boutique resorts – Secret Bay , near the town of Portsmouth, being a good example. Perched on a clifftop, it has six self-contained villas and bungalows and offers panoramic views. \nA five-minute kayak around a headland will lead you to a small, often empty beach, arguably the ultimate luxury. It’s this image of Dominica – of space, peace and untrammelled nature – that will stay with me for a long time. Secret Bay The essentials Getting there \nPaul Bignell flew from London Gatwick to Antigua with British Airways (ba.com), which has fares from £468 return. From Antigua he flew to Dominica with Liat (liat.com) for £248 return. Where to stay \nRooms at Papillote start at $121/£96 for a single room and $139 for a double. \nAt Secret Bay rates range from $565 for a one-bedroom bungalow to $1,425 for a honeymoon villa with pool. For a full review, see telegraph.co.uk/tt-secretbay. \nBeau Rive is a secluded plantation-style house on a clifftop, with 10 bedrooms and two cottages overlooking the wild Atlantic coast; from $200 for a double room. \nRosalie Bay Resort , located next to the Rosalie River on Dominica’s wilder Atlantic coast, is an eco-resort – powered by its own large wind turbine – which runs a turtle breeding programme. There are 28 large rooms and suites (from $225 per night), a swimming pool and a good restaurant. For a full review, see telegraph.co.uk/tt-rosaliebay .
