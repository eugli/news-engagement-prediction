A Russian drone-building startup just dropped some crazy new video showcasing the closest thing we've seen to Return of the Jedi 's famous vehicles IRL. \nHoversurf 's newest prototype, the Scorpion-3, is a single-seat electric quadcopter that looks to be the world's first fully rideable hoverbike. The vehicle, which can be controlled by a human pilot or remotely as a drone, could be used in the future for transport, shipping cargo, and more—once everyone gets adjusted to those dangerous-looking propellors spinning right next to the pilot's legs. SEE ALSO: Forget taxis; Dubai wants to fly you around in passenger drones \nThe team behind Hoversurf aimed to make operating the Scorpion-3 as simple as riding a bike by combining a motorcycle seat and frame with quadcopter drone tech. \nWhile it's steered by a human pilot, a built-in safety system keeps it from losing control—and going too fast or high. That's kind of a buzzkill for thrill-seekers, but if the safeguards can help drivers avoid flying into trees or falling out of the sky, they'll probably adjust to the constraints. \nHoversurf claims its hoverbike may be used for \"extreme sports,\" but with so much potential for personal transportation, it's sure to be put to other uses if and when it evolves beyond the prototype phase. \nThere are other hoverbike prototypes in the works, but none of them have performed as well as the Scorpion-3 on camera—especially not with a human pilot along for the ride. The Hoversurf team actually referenced a few of these other projects in its release touting the Scorpion-3, including the US Army's JTARV prototype , which is being made with help from the U.K.'s Malloy aeronautics team but is years away from being ready for a rider. \nYouTuber Colin Furze notably showed off his own homemade hoverbike rig last year, but that was just a one-off, mad-scientist project. \nIt looks like Hoversurf could someday be the answer to our adrenaline-fueled speeder bike dreams. Other flying machines, like the EHang 184, which is slated to be used for airborne taxi service in Dubai as soon as this summer, could fulfill the demand for autonomous personal flying transport.
