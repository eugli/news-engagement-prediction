The incident occurred Thursday night around 9 pm.\nAccording to KOB 4 , Alamogordo Police says “three armed men and a woman [tried] to break into a home.” The woman knocked on the door and the three men approached with weapons once the resident opened it.\nThe homeowner closed the door when the men approached and the men tried to open it, only to look through the glass and see something that set them to flight.\nIn the video, one of the suspects can be seen holding a handgun and another can be seen holding an AR-15 style rifle.\nAlamogordo Deputy Chief Roger Schoolcraft said the suspects “headed south on foot” and are currently being sought.\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins , a Breitbart News podcast.
