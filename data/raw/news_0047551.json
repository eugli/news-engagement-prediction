Reuters \nAnd Gazzetta dello Sport report that his form has alerted Juventus , Napoli and Borussia Dortmund — with Roma likely to be priced out of a summer move. \nWhile, recent howlers by Cech could see him given a reprieve at the Emirates. \nRoma would love to keep the 26-year-old beyond the end of the season, but will not pay the £13.6million fee agreed at the beginning of the loan deal. \nIn terms of guaranteed game time, Dortmund would be the most appealing to Szczesny.
