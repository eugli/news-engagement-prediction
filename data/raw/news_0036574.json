Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nDonald Trump has managed to outlast scandal after scandal, from commenting on Alicia Machado’s weight gain to allegedly colluding with senior Russian intelligence officials during his campaign.

Do people care? ESPN thinks so, placing it in their \"Top Headlines\" section. Slow news day, guys? \n— Chris Presley (@_ChrisPresley) February 15, 2017 \nWe need a second source on this … maybe a third. Sounds like more fake news.
