FORUM: Front row, 4th from left is Founder of the WARIF Centre, Dr. Kemi Da-Silva Ibru; 5th from left is the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Mr Fatai Owoseni, with Area Commanders from across Lagos State, during the interactive session at the Police Officers Mess, Ikeja, Lagos, last week. \nWARIF is a Non-Governmental Organization incorporated in 2016 by Dr Kemi Da-Silva Ibru, who is a member of the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team (DSVRT). The Foundation was created to raise awareness and advocate against this increasing prevalence of sexual violence experienced by women and to ensure such women have a safe place if and whenever such violence occurs. \nThe WARIF Centre has a team of qualified full time medical staff, specifically trained to carry out medical examinations and obtain biological specimens to facilitate the collection of evidence and help with police investigations. \nShe said at the Centre, rape survivors would be helped to overcome fear of stigmatization and discrimination by counselors trained by the Washington DC Rape Crisis Centre (DCRCC) in partnership with WARIF, that would assist in the healing process, ensuring they become empowered and seek justice if this is their choice. \nAs part of the preventive measures is the implementation of a Youth Based Awareness Programme in secondary schools and higher institutions. The curriculum is based on creating awareness and the importance of gender equality, a change in behaviour and practices and the prevention of gender based violence in our schools and communities. \nThe Commissioner commended WARIF saying the Police is always ready to assist survivors.
