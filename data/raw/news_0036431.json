Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nAfter President Donald Trump’s lengthy press conference wrapped up Thursday afternoon, “unhinged” appeared to emerge as the word of the day on Twitter as journalists who found themselves labeled again as purveyors of “fake news” consoled each other on social media. \nNBC News political director Chuck Todd perhaps took the press conference the hardest, at least publicly, calling Trump’s attempts to delegitimize the press “un-American” and no laughing matter . First word out of @WolfBlitzer 's mouth after the POTUS press conference: \"Wow.\" \n— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 16, 2017 . @jaketapper reacts to Donald Trump's news conference: It was unhinged.. it was wild https://t.co/Ezi1b5j4VC https://t.co/ZDII92SgGm \n— The Lead CNN (@TheLeadCNN) February 16, 2017 CBS's Scott Pelley: \"Today, we learned the length of the president's fuse: 28 days.\" \n— David Goodman (@davidgoodmanFBN) February 16, 2017 \nBloomberg’s Deena Shanker tweeted a link to her piece, “How to Stay Sane in a World of Crazy News,” and advised reporters to indulge in some down-time. Reporters, promise yourselves an hour of unplugged time tonight, in yoga, w/a human, or a book https://t.co/QX3FvXeR3D \n— Deena Shanker (@deenashanker) February 16, 2017 \nThroughout the campaign season, Trump would call out the press at campaign rallies, and reporters would relay stories of how one kind person would approach and thank them for their work. That seems to be happening still; check out this thank-you card making the rounds online. \n— Laurie Ⓥ (@L821L) February 17, 2017 \nMaybe the likes and shares will pick up should the card go viral, but until then, Peter Alexander can rest assured that actress Alyssa Milano believes his fact-checking of Trump at the presser earned him the title of super hero. Watch this. Watch this. Watch this. Everyone NEEDS to see this. This journalist should be wearing a cape. He's a super hero. https://t.co/y96K7gGUhC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:36:52.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
