'But I'm furious now after seeing the diggers come back, and work re-starting. 'They've basically bulldozed the site, obliterated it, and all the stuff they found has been taken away. We're not going to see it again.' The archaeology was commissioned and supervised by South Gloucestershire's archaeologist. Local historian, Steve England (pictured), at the entrance to The Dings rugby club in Lockleaze, Bristol. A developer has been slammed for bulldozing a Roman Villa site dubbed a city's 'most important discovery' ever without letting locals see it Works ground to a halt while archaeologists looked over the site where it Ã­s alleged they discovered a rare haul of artefacts which have not yet been made public A council spokesman said: 'Our archaeologist worked with Redrow once the villa discovery was made. 'Although the villa survived reasonably well, it was clear that items had been removed from many of the walls and floor surfaces at some point in the past and although a rare find, it was not considered worthy of preservation in situ. Redrow Homes said they had worked closely with archaeologists to ensure the artefacts of particular historical significance have been removed and 'safely registered and stored' 'As such, it was fully excavated and will now go through a rigorous process of post-excavation assessment, analysis and publication which will add considerably to our knowledge of the Roman period in South Gloucestershire.' Redrow Homes said they had worked closely with archaeologists to ensure the artefacts of particular historical significance have been removed and 'safely registered and stored'. They said: 'They will become a matter of public record once fully processed. 'A detailed record of all findings at the site was taken before it was covered over to ensure its safe preservation. 'The excavation of the site was concluded just before Christmas. 'Once satisfied that a thorough excavation and recording of the find had been taken, South Gloucestershire County Council gave Redrow Homes permission to continue work on the development.' The site in question belonged to the Dings Crusaders rugby club who had occupied it since 1948 before selling to Redrow.
