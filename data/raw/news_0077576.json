Our favorite Bachelor oversharer has made Nick Viall's final three, but did her latest confession go toO far? RELATED: 'Bachelor' Standout Corinne Gets Sent Home, Responds in the Most Wonderfully Corinne Way Possible Monday's special one-hour episode of The Bachelor showed Raven's romantic date with Nick in Finland, where the two enjoyed the snow and played a game of darts… before Raven revealed that she's never had an orgasm. \"I'm nervous about the fantasy suites, because I have no idea what's going to happen tonight. I have a good idea, but I'm not really sure,\" the Hoxie, Arkansas, native told the camera before heading into a candlelit dinner with Nick. Before revealing her bedroom secret, Raven wanted to get something else out of the way. \"You have made it so easy for me to love you, that I felt I missed an opportunity during hometowns to tell you. So if you kept me last rose ceremony, I had to tell you, that I do love you, and it would be the worst thing I could do to not tell you that,\" Raven eloquently revealed, before kissing a turtleneck-wearing Nick and opening the night's fantasy suite card.

The second thing is that my last boyfriend, my ex that I was intimate with, never made me orgasm.\" WATCH: Andi Dorfman Asks Nick Viall If He Regrets Infamous 'After the Final Rose' Bombshell in Tense 'Bachelor' Promo \"I was not expecting that,\" Nick replied, trying to stay cool under pressure, but revealing to the camera that Raven's bombshell may have scared him away from becoming intimate with any of his three remaining ladies. \"Not sleeping with the women might help me get to that point, so I quite honestly don't know how I'm going to approach this,\" Nick said, as he led Raven into the fantasy suite. Will Raven and Nick seal the deal, and will she find what she's looking for? We'll have to find out on next week's three-hour episode of The Bachelor.
