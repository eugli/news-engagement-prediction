With Tennessee inbouding out of a timeout with less than a minute left, and just six seconds left on the shot clock, Jordan Bowden found himself, as he thought he would be, open on the wing. Lamonte Turner delivered the pass. Bowden stepped into the shot and knocked it down. It put Tennessee up 71-66 over Ole Miss with 54 seconds left on Wednesday, the dagger that put the Rebels on ice as the Vols finished on a 20-6 run over the final seven minutes, after trailing for 28:54. “We were really trying to get it to Grant (Williams) in the post,” Bowden said of the play. “They were defending him well. (Turner) got the ball and drove it and kicked it.” \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?   Vols newsletter now!)

(Photo: Tennessee athletics, UTSports.com) “I told him before the play, ‘If you see me open, I’m going to shoot it,’” Bowden said, calling the shot the biggest of his young career. “He gave it to me and I made it.” Bowden finished with 14 points in 31 minutes against Ole Miss, after making his 22nd consecutive start, dating back to the second game of the season. He was 3-for-8 from the floor against the Rebels, made 2 of 6 from the 3-point line, grabbed seven rebounds, recorded three assists and added a steal. “I think he’s shown great progress,” Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said of Bowden. “But we still have a ways to go this season.” Bowden, a Knoxville native and product of Carter High School, has scored in double-figures five times in Tennessee’s last seven games, averaging 10.1 points per game over that span. He’s averaging 8.8 points and 22.8 minutes per game for the season, shooting 38.4 percent (66-172) from the field and 33.7 percent (32-95) from three. He’s the team’s best free-throw shooter, too, making 82.5 percent (47-57). “At this point, I don’t think it’s a stretch to say he’s been the biggest surprise of all the freshmen that we signed,” Barnes said of his six-man class in 2016. “In the fact that he was one of the last guys we signed. “He came in and has really become a two-way player. Someone we can count on on the defensive end as well as on the offensive end. I think it’s really important for him that he keeps improving.” Bowden is a little more bashful, if not downright self-deprecating, when he discusses his defense. “I’m not usually that good on defense,” Bowden said. “I haven’t been my best on defense. But in practice I have to guard (Robert) Hubbs and people like that all the time. So going into games I just try to do what I can to help my team, guard the best player.” It’s in practice where Bowden said he adjusted to the demands of the college game — the pace, the physicality, the competition. He announced his presence with a career-high 21 points in 23 minutes against Presbyterian on Dec. 6. He scored another 12 in Tennessee’s next game, the near upset at North Carolina on Dec. 11. “Coming in the first few games, you’re just trying to get used to the gym and the crowd and everything, playing with better competition,” Bowden said. “At North Carolina, that was a big game for me. Then it’s just adjusting, game-to-game getting better and the nerves start to go down.” An important part, Barnes described, is Bowden knowing what he doesn’t know. He’s a sponge when it comes to his progression as a Division I college basketball player. “I think he listens,” Barnes said. “He has the attitude that he wants to do his job. I think he’s a very unselfish player and I think he realizes (it). “He sees the game in a way that you would like a player to see it, the details, how important it is to do your job, to be on edge. That’s where he’s gotten better.” He keeps getting better on defense, too, even if Bowden is the last one willing to admit it. “He’s often drawing the defensive assignment for the other team’s best perimeter player,” Barnes said. “We expect him to do what he does on the offensive end for us. “I just think he’s worked (on his game). Not only from a physical standpoint, but mentally I think he’s worked really hard to understand what goes into winning.” \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
