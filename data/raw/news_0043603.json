Hart Photography The couple channeled \"La La Land's\" Mia and Sebastian during the engagement shoot. \nEllen Wleklinski and Corey Collins teamed up with photographer Marlies Hartmann of M. Hart Photography for the Los Angeles shoot, inspired by the Academy Award-nominated film that follows aspiring actress Mia (Emma Stone) and struggling jazz musician Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) as they fall in love and pursue their dreams. M. Hart Photography The couple took their daytime photos at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, a location that also appears in the film. \nSome of the engagement pics were taken on Jan. 29 at and around the Griffith Observatory, where parts of the movie were shot . The starry nighttime photos were taken two weeks later at the Hollywood Bowl Overlook. M. Hart Photography A romance for the ages. \n‚ÄúEllen and Corey‚Äôs relationship encapsulates the same romance, passion, playfulness and chemistry that was felt between Mia and Sebastian throughout the film,‚Äù the photographer told The Huffington Post. ‚ÄúNot only did they resemble the characters physically, but their relationship embodies all the best elements of Gosling and Stone seen in the movie.‚Äù M. Hart Photography The engagement shoot shows what it would have been like if the characters in the movie had gotten their happily ever after. \nThe bride-to-be had suggested Griffith Observatory to Marlies as a possible location for the shoot since she often runs in the park nearby. At the time, Marlies had just seen ‚ÄúLa La Land‚Äù and thought it would be a perfect theme to capture the couple‚Äôs own classic love story. \n‚ÄúI was initially hesitant to suggest it to them since I wasn‚Äôt sure if they had seen or even liked the movie, but I threw out the idea and they loved it!‚Äù she told HuffPost. ‚ÄúThey were both huge fans of the film, and Ellen always felt that Corey looked like her own personal Ryan Gosling!‚Äù M. Hart Photography \"Not only were the dancing numbers brilliant, but the on-screen chemistry between Gosling and Stone is timeless,\" Marlies said of the movie. \nThe couple plans to tie the knot in September at the Redondo Beach Historic Library.
