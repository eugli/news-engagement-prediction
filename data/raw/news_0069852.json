(DoneGood.co)   6:37 PM \nWASHINGTON — Want to boycott President Trump? There’s an app — and an extension — for that. \nDoneGood , a startup aimed at connecting progressive shoppers with companies that prioritize fair wages and environmental protection, has added a new “Boycott Trump” app and a Google Chrome extension to let people know when the companies they’re perusing online have in some way supported Trump — and give them an alternative more in line with their values. \nThe goal is to tap into the growing Boycott Trump movement, where liberals seek to avoid companies that carry Trump products, do business with Trump or are run by Trump supporters. The app and plug-in go a step further, suggesting alternate companies who pay their workers well, avoid excess pollution, and treat animals humanely. \n“The Boycott Trump movement has helped people realize how powerful their consumer spending can be as a tool for direct action. But we think it has an even more powerful impact if you don’t just not spend with Trump but also spend with companies that have progressive values,” Cullen Schwarz, one of the company’s founders, told the Daily News. “A lot of folks are saying ‘Okay, I won’t shop at Macy’s, I’ll shop at Kohl’s instead,’ but if you’re redirecting your money to another company that has sweatshops and pollutes the environment, is that what you want to do?” \nSchwarz is one of two cofounders who, ironically, started the company partly as a way to escape Washington, D.C., and politics. A longtime Democratic strategist, he most recently served as the Department of Agriculture’s press secretary during the Obama administration and worked for a number of Michigan Democrats before that. One of his partners, Scott Jacobsen, worked on a number of Democratic Senate races before a stint at the Children’s Defense Fund. \"Boycott Trump\" app users can steer clear of Trump-involved companies and learn about ones that conduct ethical business. (Evan Vucci/AP) \nThe company is a public benefit corporation — its social mission is part of its legal formation, but it makes profits by taking a commission of sales from the companies it directs to. The new product both helps liberals avoid Trump products and — Schwarz hopes — lets DoneGood capitalize on a burgeoning movement to help get the company off the ground. \nThe organization was launched three months ago to help connect socially conscious consumers with companies, and Schwarz wasn’t expecting to get pulled back into the political realm anytime soon. But he said customers started asking about ways to boycott Trump — and when they surveyed their customers, the response was overwhelming. \n“We were already showing people ethical and sustainable alternatives to all sorts of big-name companies online but now folks can also see which businesses are supporting Trump and get suggestions for companies that are selling the same kinds of products but are making the world better instead,” he said.
