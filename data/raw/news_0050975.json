Johnson, voiced her concerns that the president was “trying to undermine the media and trying to make up his own facts.” \n“And it could be that while unemployment and the economy worsens, he could have undermined the messaging so much that he can actually control exactly what people think. And that, that is our job,\" she continued. \nREAD MORE: ‘Please buy our failing paper’: WaPo trolled over dramatic new masthead slogan \nThe remark sparked no reaction from the panel but received a blunt “yeah” from colleague Scarborough, who then went on to equate Trump with Mussolini and Lenin, as reported by Grabien News. \nFormer GOP Representative Scarborough said that Trump’s description of the media as the “enemy of the people” echoed Mussolini and Lenin and “makes him sound more like a dictator in training.” \nThe clip has sparked a growing reaction online with many trolling Brzezinski and rejoicing that the “truth” is finally out. MSNBC reaction - Curated tweets by RT_Viral \nMSNBC have been consistently condemned by Trump alongside other mainstream news outlets and branded “fake news.” The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!
