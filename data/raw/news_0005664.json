I think in the longer term, it’s a great move, and I feel really good about how we’re doing there. We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it’s a great place to be,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:09:10.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
