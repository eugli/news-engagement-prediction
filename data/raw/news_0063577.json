He’s bringing that to the forefront in his new position as president and chief operating officer of electronics distributor Dow Electronics . John Yodzis Kathleen Cabble At 32 years old, Yodzis becomes the third generation in his family to lead Dow, one of the largest privately owned companies in Tampa Bay, with nearly $80 million in revenue in 2015 . He previously was executive vice president, overseeing the purchasing, marketing and sales arms of the company. “Now it all rolls up through me, which allows us to unify the direction across all departments as the company moves forward with current and strategic initiatives,” Yodzis said. Yodzis, a Tampa Bay Business Journal Up and Comer in 2013 , grew up in the business. His grandfather, Philip Decker , bought Dow in 1974, 15 years after it was founded. Decker’s daughter, Carol Yodzis , and her husband, Chip Yodzis , joined the company in 1982. Chip Yodzis now is CEO and Carol Yodzis is chairman of the board. Dow and the Yodzis family defy the conventional wisdom about family owned companies. Less than one third of family businesses survive the transition from first to second generation ownership, and another 50 percent don’t survive the transition from second to third generation, according to Forbes . But John Yodzis never thought of business and family as separate. “It was such a part of the family structure,” he said. “At the dinner table, at family gatherings, it was business and family, so it kind of feels like one.” He said he never felt pressured by his parents to join Dow. “When I was graduating college, they said we’ll be happy with whatever you want to do. Don’t feel obligated. I think sometimes that feeling of obligation sometimes drive someone further away. I was lucky enough that it was fostered positively,” he said. In college, he switched majors a couple of times, considering both medicine and law, before getting a bachelor's degree in management and finance. In graduate school at University of Florida, where he got an MBA in entrepreneurship, there was a lot of conversation around starting a business from scratch. “In speaking with my father, I said I’m not sure what I want to do, because I always had an entrepreneurial mindset and he said, you can always do that within our business. Just because it’s an existing business, an established business doesn’t mean you can’t be entrepreneur. You can come in, ask questions, and I thought that was really intriguing,” Yodzis said. An entrepreneurial mindset is both innate and learned, he said, crediting his mother and his grandfather for helping develop his own bent. “My family has given me a longer leash as I’ve grown within the business than probably most would, but they knew you’ve got to make mistakes and learn and do it on your own to know what works and what doesn’t,” Yodzis said. “There’s been times when my ideas probably have not been the best ideas but other times they have, but it’s like stock trading — as long as the good outweighs the bad you’re doing pretty well.” One change Yodzis already has brought to Dow is a more collaborative approach with employees. He said that’s reflected in the redesign of the company’s office, which is a finalist for the TBBJ ’s 2017 Coolest Office Spaces award. All the executive offices were turned into meeting spaces and everyone, including senior management, now sits in a central open floor work environment. “Collaboration is important. Employees want to be part of decisions, not feel like they are just pushed in a certain direction. With the open environment, all the employees being able to hear the ideas and collaboration is extremely important, which is a little different than it was in the past,” Yodzis said. He also admires the qualities his father and his father’s generation brought to the workforce. “It’s a hard work mentality. You have to experience what your customers do, listen to customers, get out on the road, listen to key suppliers and vendors, be a good partner. That’s No. 1 and engaging your employees in that endeavor is an important part of it,” Yodzis said. Dow is an active acquirer, including the purchases of dbSouth Distributing last year and Eagle Distributors in 2015 . More acquisitions are ahead, but not right away, Yodzis said. “We’ve done some pretty heavy acquisitions in the past couple of years, especially one that got us in the Texas market. Now it’s a matter of putting the pieces in the right place,” Yodzis said. “This current year, we’ve got more back to the basics ground work to do. Long-term I think you have to be looking at the next evolution of the business. I think more acquisitions are definitely in the future.” He stays ahead of technology trends by reading industry publications and talking to others in the industry. “It’s important to be fast and lean and prepared to take advantage of the changes. Sometimes it’s tough, the larger you grow, the slower you move. We have to be the size of a cruise ship but move like a speedboat,” Yodzis said. With John Yodzis as president and COO at Dow, Chip Yodzis will stay on as CEO, but focus more on a sister company, Digital Reception Services, a fulfillment and installation company for DISH Network (NASDAQ: DISH). DRS handles installations for DISH Network in the majority of the state of Florida. Margie Manning is Finance Editor of the Tampa Bay Business Journal. She covers the Money beat.
