The Washington D.C. offices! Getting sworn in by Joe Biden! — but being a Republican in the age of Trump is no easy feat. As Congress broke for its February recess, representatives returned to their home states with some angry constituents waiting for them. And while some put on a brave face and took it, according to a report in VICE, over 200 GOP congressmen avoided their constituent town halls, fearing bad media moments where unhappy constituents chant harsh slogans like, “Do your job!” and “Where are you?” \nFortunately, we live in the age of the Internet, where everyone who wants to can have their say — if not face-to-face with their tax-dollar-supported Congressional representative, then at least with the wider public through social media. And the jilted constituents have not been taking their rebuff lying down. People have shown up at Town Halls regardless of whether their representative is there — and boy, are they annoyed. \nWe’ve gathered here the top 11 trolling of politicians who avoided their town halls this week, and I have to say, I’m impressed with how creative the citizenry has gotten. So, grab your digital pitchforks, light your Twitter torches, and strap on your angriest overalls: we’re going a-politickin’. 1. Sen.
