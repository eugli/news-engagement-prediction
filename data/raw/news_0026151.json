Elizabeth Warren chose to read a damning letter from Coretta Scott King — the widow of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. — asking Congress to block Sessions' 1986 nomination to become a federal judge. In the letter, King stated, \"I believe his confirmation would have a devastating effect on not only the judicial system in Alabama, but also on the progress we have made toward fulfilling my husband’s dream.\" As The Washington Post reports, King's letter and opposition to Sessions ended up being crucial in keeping him from being confirmed.\n But when Warren repeated King's words on the Senate floor Tuesday night, she received a warning from presiding officer Sen. Steve Daines that she was violating Rule 19 of the Senate:\nNo Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator. In response, Warren expressed her surprise that King's words should be considered a \"violation.\" She was then allowed to continue after agreeing to be wary of the rule. But just a few minutes later, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell interrupted her — stating she had \"impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama ... I call the senator to order under the provisions of Rule 19.\"\n\"I am surprised that the words of Coretta Scott King are not suitable for debate in the United States Senate,\" Warren immediately countered. \"I ask leave of the Senate to continue my remarks.\"\nIn response, Daines asked if there were any objections from the Senate, and McConnell said that there was. Warren was then asked to take her seat, despite appealing McConnell's ruling.\nNot long after, Warren took to Twitter to express her bewilderment and anger over what had happened.\nTonight on the Senate floor, I tried to speak about why @SenatorSessions is totally unfit to serve as Attorney General.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017\nOn the floor, I read a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing @SenatorSessions 's judicial nomination: https://t.co/mnACXekh8f\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 I spoke out about @SenatorSessions – until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me. https://t.co/qbty7x0iLl\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 I will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory & racist comments that have no place in our justice system.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017\nI will not be silent while the Republicans rubber stamp an AG who will never stand up to the @POTUS when he breaks the law.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 Tonight @SenateMajLdr silenced Mrs King's voice on the Sen floor - & millions who are afraid & appalled by what's happening in our country.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 \"I spoke out about Senator Sessions — until Senate Majority Leader McConnell decided to silence me,\" she wrote. \"I will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory and racist comments that have no place in our justice system.
