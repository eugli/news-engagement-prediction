Christina appeared on Good Morning America on Tuesday, where she talked about her relationship with her ex -- who appeared on the Today show on the same day -- and still working with him on their hit HGTV show. The 33-year-old reality star says that since the two have been through so much together, working through their split is no different. \"You know, Tarek and I met 10 years ago through work,\" she explained. \"We went through a market crash ... through cancer, infertility. You know, now we're going through a very public divorce but, despite everything, our primary focus is, and always will be, our kids.\" WATCH: 'Flip or Flop' Stars Christina and Tarek El Moussa Reunite for First Joint Appearance Since Announcing Split \"We continue to work together and there's a lot of false stories and a lot of hype, but in the end, we're just normal, nice people, who just want to be the best parents and co-workers we can be,\" she added. As for how she and 35-year-old Tarek are working together, Christina says the two have no issue filming three or four days a week for season 7. The two are even continuing to put on their seminar program side by side -- titled Success Path, Education -- which involves traveling to Las Vegas together. \"Honestly, Tarek and I met through work, so we worked together before we even started dating -- it's our normal,\" Christina shared. \"We also run a seminar together, and every five weeks we go to Vegas together. We're onstage and we have a great time. We'll always be working together.\" Christina says co-parenting their two children -- 6-year-old Taylor and 1-year-old Bradyen -- is also going \"really good.\" \"Our kids are transitioning well,\" she said. \"Tarek and I are friends.\" WATCH: EXCLUSIVE: Christina El Moussa, for the first time, speaks out LIVE about her life, her show and what lies ahead pic.twitter.com/Mqnq20irbN WATCH: Christina El Moussa Says Filming 'Flip or Flop' Has Been a Breeze Amid Divorce From Husband Tarek Both Christina and Tarek have since moved on from their breakup.
