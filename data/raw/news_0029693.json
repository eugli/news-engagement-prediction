Driver Colin Sharp captured the dramatic footage on camera near Ballan, Victoria, before uploading it online. Mr Sharp said the train was traveling at 160km/h when he spotted the rider and had no time to stop. This is the moment a biker was almost killed after falling off in the middle of train tracks in Victoria before a speeding locomotive appeared He told 3AW he initially thought he had hit the man, and only later discovered the rider had escaped uninjured.
