Ruth Bader Ginsburg reflects on a monumental ruling at VMI \"You talk about surreal,\" Coach Cal said in an interview. \"They asked a couple of days prior if I had time to meet him and I said, 'I'll delay the game!'\" Tip off was at 9 p.m. and Roberts wandered in to Rupp Arena closer to 8. The TV in the coach's office happened to be on in time for Trump to formally announce his nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch. \"I said, do you mind if we watch?\" Calipari said he told Roberts. \"And he said, 'you know you aren't going to get any emotion from me about the pick.'\" Read More After Roberts learned about his next potential colleague, the two men discussed the game and looked at pictures of Anthony Davis and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. Roberts then invited the coach to come to Washington and maybe meet some of his bench mates. \"I said, 'absolutely,'\" Calipari said. \"If that's not a bucket list item, I don't know what is.\" During the game, the coach said he snuck a couple of peeks at the Chief until things got tense.
