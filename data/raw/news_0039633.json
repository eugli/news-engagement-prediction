Editor Advertisement \nSo, Singapore has dropped to 14th place in the world for the best cities in the world for students. This represents a drop of 8 places. Among the reasons cited for the drop, was the high cost of living in Singapore. \nThe authorities' master plan here of making Singapore a global hub for education seems to have taken a massive blow. Instead of climbing towards that number one spot, we dropped. And judging by the ever increasing cost of everything here, it is not ever likely that Singapore can climb that high in the rankings again. We Singaporeans all know this. The high cost of living is realy a burden to almost everyone of us. Now, even international students are deterred from coming here and study. \nYet, our highly paid ministers think the high cost is not a problem, just a perceived issue made big by the opposition. After all, all Singaporeans own a house over their heads, right? Surely if everyone can have a house, then everyone can afford to live comfortably, right? \nRashid Ahmat \nA.S.S.
