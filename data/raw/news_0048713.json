Aravinnd revealed to us recently that his next film, which will have him in the lead role, will see him play a passionate chef. The film will be directed by Karthik Saragur of Jeerjimbe fame. \"The role is not of a chef, but more like an adige bhatta (cook). The film will be shot across Karnataka and explore the traditional and lesser known cuisines of the state, with food being a binding factor connecting the plot,\" says Aravinnd. The actor also admits that he is a foodie himself and loves eating different cuisines. \"When I lived in the UK , I used to cook myself. Another thing that works to my advantage is that we have a Masterchef India contestant (Ashwin Iyer) at home,\" he adds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:00:00.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
