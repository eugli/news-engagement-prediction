Gloucester-based Beauport Hospitality Group will open Rail Stop Restaurant & Bar, an 11,738-square-foot bar and restaurant, at 96 Guest St. The restaurant will be designed by Peter Niemitz and offer “upscale contemporary New England cuisine,” including steak, seafood, craft cocktails, wine and artisanal draft beers. 6 photos Boston Landing co-developers NB Development Group and HYM Investment Group are planning a… more New Hampshire-based The Flatbread Co. will open an 8,349-square-foot restaurant and candlepin bowling alley at the base of the Warrior Ice Arena, the practice rink for the Boston Bruins. The restaurant will feature wood-fired pizza, salads and beer. Kōhi Coffee Co. will open in a 1,295-square-foot location at 130 Guest St. immediately adjacent to the New Balance global flagship store. The coffeeshop first launched in Provincetown in 2014 and is known for its handcrafted espresso, coffee, cold brew and tea. “In addition to their shared New England home grown connection, all of these tenants also support the Live Work Play environment of the development,” Erin Harvey , senior leasing and marketing manager of NB Development Group, in a statement. “The revolutionary transformation of this former light industrial area, along with the unique office, lab, retail, hotel and sports uses, makes Boston Landing one of the most unique projects in the region.” A 295-unit residential building is now under construction at Boston Landing, and the development will eventually include an MBTA Commuter Rail station and the future practice court for the Boston Celtics. The Boston Landing retail leasing news comes just a few days after Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. LLC notified the city of Boston of its intent to redevelop its existing store at 60 Everett St. and build a combined 1,010 residential units, Class A office space and ground-floor retail and restaurant space. That 11-acre development site — which Stop & Shop has dubbed “Allston Yards” — is immediately adjacent to the 15-acre Boston Landing site.
