For instance, Mr Trump plans to build a wall between the US and Mexico and to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which includes the US, Canada and Mexico. \n\"This is wrong for the US and this is wrong for a country like mine that has been a friend and good partner of the US,\" Mr Zedillo said. \nHe said it was incorrect to assume that the Nafta was an automatic job transfer from the US to Mexico. Besides, the US administration had failed to consider the fact that transportation and information technology have changed international trade these days. \n\"I think it will be counter-productive because it will make people suffer. And if they do that, that could also make their country suffer. I think that is wrong. They are not acting in their own interests. And they have no right to damage the interests of other countries. I hope they will reconsider,\" he said. \n\"I am hopeful that sooner rather than later not only people but also companies that would be affected will speak their mind.\" \nMr Zedillo was in Bangkok to attend the Prince Mahidol Award Conference. \nAfter retiring from politics, Mr Zedillo became an academic. A professor in international economics and politics at Yale University, he is also the presidential counsellor of Laureate International Universities whose members include Stamford International University in Thailand. \n\"Education is going to be challenged by circumstances. There is a gap between science, the economy and technology and the capacity of education to catch up,\" he said. \n\"Education is even more crucial in the 21st century because change is happening so fast. Now we have to empower our students to be adaptive to the changing environment.\" \nOne of the challenges facing the new generation is changing geopolitics. Isolation and protectionism are becoming prevalent in a very complicated world. \n\"Unfortunately, it is a time of very high risk [in terms of] international peace and security, economy and globalisation. But I say with confidence that the challenge will be overcome, not so much because of my generation but because of young people who are creating the new world,\" Mr Zedillo said. \n\"We see conflicts in places like the Middle East that have high human and economic costs. And yet we see the great power of the world not forcefully solving the issues. We see a more assertive China, but I think they have the right to be assertive. But we see now the reaction to that assertive reaction. We hope that that will not lead to bigger conflict.\" \nHe described the emerging forces of protectionism and nationalism as \"a very dark cloud on the horizon of the global economy\". \nHe added: \"We just hope that these problems are temporary. But in order to dissipate that risk, I think a lot of work has to be done. And it means young people are confronting some uncertainties. I hope that eventually it will improve, but right now it is not very good.\" \nMr Zedillo became Mexico's president in late 1994. He stayed in office until 2000 and witnessed the 1997 Asian financial crisis in which Thailand was the epicentre. \n\"Mexico had its own crisis two years before Asia. I remember that Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in 1995 that our crisis would be the first crisis of the emerging markets in the 21st century. Little did we know that this could happen in other places. Two years later, it was happening in Asia. And then it was happening in Russia. Then it was happening in Brazil. And in 2008 we were in the middle of another financial crisis,\" he said. \n\"I think Asians have learned a lot from the financial crisis by being more prudent, by having not less open but more open economies, which I think is a great example. \n\"Asian countries had been traumatised by the crisis and they said, 'No, we have to stay on course. We have to be more prudent fiscally and financially. But we are going to be open.' \n\"In the early 1970s with the oil crisis, there were problems for everybody. And if South Korea and Singapore had reacted by closing themselves, it would have been a disaster. This miracle would have been interrupted. \n\"What happened is that Singapore became even more open. South Korea became even more export-oriented. And they became developed and rich countries. \n\"After the 1997 crisis, Asia opened up even more. So I don't understand why some countries now think differently. That is the way of the past and it is a mistake.\" \nSEAL THE DEAL: President Trump signs an order to construct a wall on the border.
