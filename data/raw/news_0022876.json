We've been informed of this development.Taken up matter with Chinese Govt-V Swarup on China blocking US' move at UN for banning Masood Azhar pic.twitter.com/QSbta679ZR — ANI (@ANI_news) February 7, 2017 \nThe proposal was supported by the UK and France. But China opposed the US move by putting a hold on the proposal. \nThe American proposal came barely weeks after India's efforts to get Azhar banned by the UN were blocked by China in December last. It was submitted just a day before the inauguration of US President Donald Trump, officials privy to the development said. \nThe hold remains for six months and can be further extended by three months. During this period, it can be anytime converted into a ‘block’, thereby, ending the life of the proposal. \nOnce designated, the UN Sanction Committee's listing will force imposition of asset freeze and travel ban on Azhar by countries including Pakistan. \nChina has been constantly opposing efforts to get Azhar banned by the UN, which has proscribed his outfit JeM in 2001. The Chinese opposition is also seen by many here as an action taken at the behest of its ‘all-weather ally’ Pakistan. \nAfter the attack on the IAF base at Pathankot in January last year, India in February wrote to the UN calling for immediate action to list Azhar under the Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee. The efforts faced stiff opposition by China, which twice put a \"technical hold\" before finally blocking the Indian proposal in December.
