Rhinos are not the only problem, we’ve seen a 300% increase in elephant poaching. We should be looking at solving this problem of organised crime.” \nThe draft regulations are vague, she argues. “The problem is that it’s not clear if it’s two rhinos per person per day, two per week or two in a lifetime. There is not enough detail to dissect this document.” \nAn online petition by the Global March for Elephants and Rhinos, warned South Africa’s rhino are facing extinction. “An average three rhinos per day are losing their lives to poachers. Opening trade will escalate the extinction of this iconic species.” \nPro-trade lobby group, Rhino Alive SA, argues that legal trade provides “self-sustaining funds” to farmers to protect rhinos. But the WWF-SA argues there is no demand in this country, “so it’s inconceivable that anyone would buy it”. \nLifting the domestic moratorium can only encourage illegal activity, it maintains. \nThe 2009 moratorium was challenged in court by Johan Kruger in 2012 and John Hume in 2015. Wildlife Ranching SA and the Private Rhino Owners Association of SA supported the application. \nThis week, a study by a team of researchers from Cardiff University in Wales found how the black rhino - South Africa is home to nearly 40% of the population - is on the verge of extinction again because of unsustainable poaching in its native range.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:24:08.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
