While some people make quilts as an afternoon pastime, she made them to communicate her love for her family.\nThis was very clear at her funeral, when her children and grandchildren decided to drape all of the quilts that she had made over the backs of the pews.\n\"Never did I imagine how many there were,\" Margaret's granddaughter, Christina Tollman, told TODAY. \"We covered almost every single pew in that church. I never knew how many she actually made.\"\nAnd while the quilts are special, the meaning behind them really takes the cake.\nMargaret spent her life caring for her family. She had three children of her own, and then took in her sister-in-law's twins after a tragic accident. Margaret and her husband, Henry, raised all five children in a small, three-bedroom home on their farm.\nRELATED: Bride asks 92-year-old grandmother to be a bridesmaid: 'She is my best friend\nMargaret initially started sewing in order to make clothes for her children, but as they grew up and had kids of their own, she had to make those kids something as well.\nThat's where the quilts come in. She started making them for each grandchild as they graduated from high school.\n© Courtesy of Christina Tollman Margaret Hubl's quilts displayed at her funeral \"She wanted us to have something to wrap up and keep warm in when we went away to school,\" said Tollman.\nMargaret really thought about each person who would be receiving the quilts, too.\nRELATED: Woman turns her grandparents' love letters into wearable works of art\n\"When we sat down to go through her things we found this — I call it a pocket notebook. Inside it says whose quilt she was working on, what day she put it in the quilt frame and which day she took it out,\" explained Tollman.\nAnd as Margaret's children began to take care of themselves, she began putting more time into the quilts. They became a treasured gift for each grandchild on their wedding day.\n© Courtesy of Christina Tollman Margaret wrote the day that she started each quilt, and the day she finished. The top says, \"Put bow tie quilt in Feb. 13- \"I actually have three cousins that are not married, and the day of her funeral was the day that they got to see their quilts for the first time,\" said Tollman. \"That was really kind of a neat moment.\"\nRELATED: Funeral home therapy dog brings comfort and unexpected smiles to grieving families\nAll of those hours and all of the thought — it was all worth it. Margaret's children now have something to hold on to, to wrap around them whenever they need to feel the comfort of their loved one. So while giving a quilt may seem so simple, it certainly stands out as one of the most thoughtful gifts.\n\"This is the love that Grandma made for each of us, this is what she made for each of us to wrap up in when we hurt,\" said Tollman. \"When we miss her.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.today.com/style/bride-asks-92-year-old-grandmother-be-bridesmaid-wedding-t108568", "http://www.today.com/style/forever-yours-agnes-jewelry-line-turns-love-letters-jewelry-t108192", "http://www.today.com/", "http://www.today.com/pets/lulu-therapy-dog-brings-comfort-unexpected-smiles-grieving-families-t100462"], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:47:07.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
