(Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) \nThousands of college athletes who received traditional sports scholarships rather a new version that covers the full cost of attending school will be compensated for the difference under a $208.7 million settlement reached Friday night between the NCAA and plaintiffs in a presumptive class-action antitrust lawsuit against the association and 11 major conferences. \nThe deal, which must be approved by a federal judge, would be the second-largest legal settlement in the NCAA's history. Similar litigation in a case led by Stanford football football player Jason White ended in 2008 with an agreement worth just under $230 million. \nAccording to documents filed Friday night, for athletes covered by the settlement who played their sport for four years, the average settlement payout will be nearly $6,800. In addition, if the proposed agreement is approved, athletes who are eligible for a payment will not have to file a claim form -- they will simply receive a check. \nAthletes who have remaining eligibility when they receive a check will be able to accept the money without any impact on their ability to continue playing in college. \nThe settlement does not impact another portion of this case -- or another. related case -- that is challenging the NCAA’s cost-of-attendance-based limits on the compensation athletes can receive while playing college sports. In that portion of this case, and in the related case, the plaintiffs are seeking an injunction that would nullify the current limits. \nAll of these cases are being handled by U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken, who oversaw the Ed O’Bannon antitrust case. She already has granted class-action status to the groups of athletes seeking to nullify the current NCAA limits. Class-action status was being pursued in the portion of case affected by Friday’s proposed settlement. \nThe deal joins settlements in the past three years that the NCAA has reached with plaintiffs who pursued complaints concerning the use of athletes’ names and likenesses in video games and issues caused by concussions. \nThose agreements have resulted in the NCAA paying, or committing to pay, more than $300 million. \nThat figure does not include the association’s legal costs or the roughly $42 million in legal fees and costs that have been awarded for now to the plaintiffs’ lawyers in the O’Bannon antitrust case, which went to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and was brought to the Supreme Court, which chose not to hear it. (The NCAA has appealed the fees and costs award to the 9th Circuit.) \n. \nIn addition to the legal settlements, the association’s Board of Governors -- its top policy-making group, which is mainly comprised of CEO’s of Division I schools -- over the past two years has approved two special distributions to Division I schools totaling a combined $219 million. That money was earmarked to help schools pay for cost-of-attendance-based scholarships, additional food that can be made available to athletes or various academic and health-related projects. \nThose outlays were intended to be in addition to the NCAA’s usual annual distributions to Division I schools and conferences, which in each of the past two years have totaled roughly $550 million. \nThe newly settled case began in March 2014 in U.S. District Court on behalf of former West Virginia football player Shawne Alston led by the Seattle-based firm Hangens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP. The firm also has led cases against the NCAA concerning video games and concussions that settled or have settlement pending.
