You have now wasted my time and yours.\" \nThe 26-year-old Massey University graduate said she was stunned. \n\"It was just plain rude, to think it was from an HR company is just crazy. \n\"Throughout tertiary study we're expected to treat professionals in the industry in a respective manner and I would think it's only fair we are given the same treatment back.\" \nNelson provided a cover letter and CV with the application which outlined her seven years' experience in the retail industry, as well as a textiles degree she finished last year. Ad Feedback \nShe forwarded the curt response onto SEEK who reached out to Apparel HR \"to have a chat about how to engage with candidates in a polite and constructive way\". \nJulie Malone, director of the fashion company, emailed Nelson to say \"the reply was generated from an email address ... associated with our business.\" \n\"I just wanted to let you know that it was not from me personally and that it was not signed with a name, making it a little harder to pinpoint the person.\" \nMalone said the company would be looking at their security systems to ascertain who sent the response. \n\"I'm not sure what to make of it,\" said Nelson. \"The application page on SEEK had Julie Malone's name as the person of contact for that role. \n\"The format in which the emails are written all seem to be exactly the same, the spacing and paragraph style for example, and their replies have come from three different email addresses. \n\"It makes me think twice about the legitimacy of the company, especially when I read comments on Facebook stating others have had bad experiences with them too.\" \nMalone said the company may have been hacked, and they were investigating what had happened. \n\"We are working through this situation to find out how this email was sent. I have apologised to the Ms Nelson, as I know it it must be distressing for her. It is distressing for us too. \n\"Our website and facebook accounts were hacked last year, which we reported to the police, it could be a similar situation with this. We have an external system engineer looking into it, but at this stage I don't know how long that process will take.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:00:13.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
