Editor Advertisement \nSo, the Manpower Minister criticised Surbana yesterday for publicly labeling its employees \"poor performers\" when they were fired early last month. Lim Swee Say said the manner in which the infrastructure consultancy had laid off 54 workers, then criticised them in a strongly worded letter to staff and a statement to the media, was unacceptable. \nBut that's all they can do, isn't it? Criticise them also, they have already carried out the sackings, and the lives of the 54 workers will forever be changed. Their reputations are already tarnished. Although Surbana's management and the unions have reached a settlement, and will give the affected workers an ex gratia payment, tarnished reputations will be harder to repair. \nNeo CC \nA.S.S.
