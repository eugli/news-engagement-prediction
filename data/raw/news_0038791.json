It remains to be seen if he will pull anything special out of the hat (so to speak) for this first competitive meeting with his sibling. \nFlorentin's snazzy new haircut comes on the same day it was revealed that former Sunderland forward Asamoah Gyan is on a list of 47 players in the United Arab Emirates deemed to be sporting \"unethical hairstyles\" . \nThe Saint-Etienne midfielder, 26, has spoken of his excitement ahead of the Europa League knockout stages and expects the tie to be \"a magical moment\" for the two Pogbas.

Obviously these things don't happen very often in a player's career, the chance to see her two sons playing against each other. She can't lose really, can she?\" Florentin Pogba has confirmed his mum will be present at both legs of St Etienne's Europa League clash with Manchester United Credit: Martin Rickett/PA \nF lorentin added that the pair had not had much contact since the draw for the knockout stages pitted the brothers against one another. \n\"We've given each other some stick and there was some banter straight after the draw was made, but since then we've been so focused on our respective league games.\" \nA third Pogba brother - Mathias , Florentin's twin - currently plays for Sparta Rotterdam in the Netherlands.
