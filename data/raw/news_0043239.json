If you believe the Washington Post story that said there were nine people who said this, these are nine people who broke the law.\"\nNunes said the FBI and other intelligence agencies ought to investigate who has leaked information to the press because so few people in the administration knew these secrets, that it would have had to have been someone at the \"highest levels of the Obama administration\" who is an acting official until Trump replaces him or her.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts   news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.
