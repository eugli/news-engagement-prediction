The phone calls also involved the patients reflecting on how their lives have improved as a result of weight loss, making a plan for situations when they might feel tempted to go back to old habits, and specifying how frequently they weigh themselves and revisit weight loss efforts if they have gained weight. All participants, in both groups, were scheduled for assessment appointments at the beginning of the study and then after 14, 26, 42 and 56 weeks. Why your weight loss plateaus, and how to fight it After 56 weeks, Voils said, 58.6% of patients in the intervention group either regained some weight or saw no change in weight, while 72.5% of patients in the other group regained or saw no change, a difference of 13.9 percentage points. The average weight regain in the intervention group was only about 1.6 pounds, compared with about 5.2 pounds in the other group, the researchers found. \"Although this may not seem like a lot of weight, given the low program costs and the high benefit of carrying less weight over the longer term, this is an important finding that adds to our understanding about how best to help patients with obesity,\" said Dr. Jennifer Kraschnewski, associate professor at the Penn State College of Medicine, who was not involved in the new study. \"Obesity is now recognized as a chronic disease. However, we still don't treat it this way in the clinical setting. Clinically, we typically help patients engage in weight loss efforts, stand back and watch as they regain, and then try to re-engage them in additional weight loss efforts,\" she said. \"We wouldn't treat someone's high blood pressure with a medication for only a year and then scratch our heads as to why their blood pressure is high again two years later. For obesity to be treated as a chronic disease, new approaches to management are critical.\" Yet, the new study had some limitations. What might help weight control the most? It remains unclear in the study whether regular weighing, planning for high-risk situations or obtaining outside support was most effective in weight loss management, Voils said. \"Our study design did not allow us to say which component of our intervention was most effective,\" Voils said. \"There is evidence that self-weighing and relapse prevention help people maintain weight loss. Our intervention incorporates those skills and adds having patients reflect on the benefits they experienced with weight loss and talking with a support person about what they can do to support weight maintenance efforts,\" she said. Water: The secret to losing weight? Though it remains difficult to establish which part of the intervention had the most impact on patients, having constant interaction with a supportive coach probably played a significant role in weight maintenance, said Dr. Samuel Grief, associate professor of clinical family medicine at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago, who was not involved in the study. \"Group dynamics tend to be more helpful, or a team-based approach using care coordination,\" Grief said. \"That would be my answer. Because strategies like food journaling or diaries or writing out what activities you do every day or emotions that you're feeling, all that is relevant, but there's not a lot of science behind those causing weight loss or mitigation of weight regain. Otherwise, everybody would do it,\" he said. \"Also, it would have been helpful to gauge their self-efficacy.\" Studies suggest that having self-efficacy , or believing that you will be successful in losing weight , has been linked to greater success in weight management , Grief said. Additionally, the researchers were unable to assess longer-term weight maintenance and relied on self-reports about dietary intake and physical activity. \"Our population was primarily middle-aged men who were white or African-American, and results may not generalize to other populations,\" Voils said. Tips for keeping the weight off The National Weight Control Registry , which has tracked more than 10,000 individuals who have maintained significant weight losses, offers some recommendations on how to maintain weight control.

Rena Wing, a professor at Brown University's Warren Alpert Medical School, and James Hill, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, established the registry in 1994. \"To maintain weight loss, there must be continued adherence to a low-calorie diet and high physical activity,\" Wing said. She said the registry suggests that the following strategies may help someone who is trying to maintain their weight loss: Maintain high levels of physical activity, in which the recommended goal is 250 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity, such as brisk walking. Monitor your weight by weighing yourself frequently.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:25:07.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
