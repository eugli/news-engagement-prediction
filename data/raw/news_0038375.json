(French) President (Francois) Hollande and other European leaders have been very clear that this would mean accepting the 'four freedoms' of goods, capital, services and people and I respect their position.\n\"Britain understands that EU leaders want to continue with the process of integration.\n\"We do not, to borrow the phrase, seek to cherry-pick which bits of membership we desire.\"\nBrexit | European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill M rs May also highlighted French interest in a good Brexit deal, pointing out that the UK is France's fifth-largest export market with bilateral trade worth more than 50 billion euros last year.\n\"UK companies are responsible for an estimated 230,000 jobs in France, and French companies for about 370,000 jobs in the UK,\" she added.\nThe French senate report described Mrs May’s recent Brexit speech in which she set out her plan for the negotiations as a “mixture of veiled threats and pledges of goodwill”.\nMr Raffarin said: “From a European point of view ... the new agreements cannot be better than the old ones – which might be difficult for the United Kingdom side to accept – while at the same time protecting the EU’s joint interests, notably on security and defence.”\nMrs May and Mr Cazeneuve are also set to agree to maintain pressure on Russia over its \"aggressive and destabilising\" actions in Ukraine.\nThe Prime Minister said she is \"sure\" they will agree on the importance of pushing Russia in response to the \"drastic deterioration\" in the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine.\nMrs May highlighted \"vital\" cooperation on security and defence and said in the wake of \"horrific\" terror attacks over the past two years, Britain will \"continue to stand shoulder to shoulder\" with France \"as a staunch ally and a great friend\".\nTimeline | Key Brexit dates", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:49:41.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
