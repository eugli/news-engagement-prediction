(Tom Burton/Orlando Sentinel) Central Florida school districts say they accommodate transgender students' need to use the restroom on a case-by-case basis. (Tom Burton/Orlando Sentinel) (Tom Burton / Orlando Sentinel) Annie Martin announced he’s rescinding an Obama administration order for schools to allow students to use restrooms that align with their gender identity.\nSchool leaders in Orange , Seminole, Lake and Osceola counties say they work with students individually to determine where they should use the restroom while on campus. \nOrange County, the area’s largest district, recommends allowing students to use staff or private facilities, said Lorena Hitchcock, a district spokeswoman. \n“Our existing practice, for many years, is if a student identifies himself or herself as being transgender, school administrators work with that student and the student’s parents in providing accommodations,” she said. \nThe Obama administration issued a directive last May requiring public school districts to allow transgender students to use the restrooms aligned with their gender identities. But in late August, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor issued a temporary injunction against the Obama administration's guidelines after 13 states filed a lawsuit lawsuit to block the guidelines. Though Florida wasn’t named in the suit, O'Connor’s ruling applies to every state, so schools here weren’t required to follow the Obama order. \nImmediately following the Obama directive, most Central Florida districts refused to say whether they’d follow it. Instead, they said they planned to continue working with transgender students individually or they were still reviewing the order. \nEstimates of the number of transgender adults in the United States vary, but most studies suggest it’s 1 percent or less of the population. \nGina Duncan, the director of transgender equality for Equality Florida, said transgender students are becoming “more and more common” in schools because people are coming out at younger ages. \nDuncan, who has worked with transgender students and schools in Central Florida, said districts that claim they accommodate students’ restroom needs on a case-by-case basis often don’t have consistent policies. They sometimes require students to use a single-stall or faculty restroom, she said, and that’s not an acceptable substitute. \n“If you’re the only person that is required to use that specific bathroom, every time you use that bathroom you are being outed,” Duncan said. You are being marginalized.” \nTrump’s order could make transgender students more vulnerable to bullying and harassment, Duncan said. She’s heard of high school students relieving themselves in plastic bottles in the parking lot or refusing to drink during the school day and getting dehydrated because they didn’t feel comfortable using the restrooms on their campus. \nSeminole Superintendent Walt Griffin wrote in an email that the issue is “complex.” \n“My goal of providing educational access and maintaining a safe environment for all students, including transgender students, means that the district works with families and students to accommodate needs on a case by case basis,” Griffin wrote. \nLake County spokeswoman Sherri Owens wrote in an email the district didn’t have “a blanket policy” that addresses the matter. \n“We’d talk with the student and/or parents to determine how best to meet the needs of the student,” she wrote. \nOwens wrote she wasn’t aware of any situations where transgender students requested to use a different restroom, but it’s possible principals handled the matter at the school level without bringing it to the district’s attention. \nOsceola County is awaiting guidance from the state on the matter, spokeswoman Dana Schafer wrote in an email. “We didn’t change anything – we handle each on a case-by-case,” she wrote. \nSchool officials in other parts of the state also reacted to the news of Trump’s order on Thursday. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho of Miami-Dade, the state’s largest school district, posted on Twitter that “gender identification protections” were in place before Obama’s order and they will remain. \n“We have a long-standing non-discrimination policy and we have worked with many students on a case-by-case basis,” said John Schuster, a spokesman for the district. “That will continue.” \nanmartin@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5120 \nLeslie Postal contributed to this report. \n\nOrange schools will comply with transgender order » Caption Lawmakers want to move testing to end of school year \nLawmakers want Florida students to take their standardized tests at the end of the school year, instead of the current time, starting at the end of February. \nLawmakers want Florida students to take their standardized tests at the end of the school year, instead of the current time, starting at the end of February.
