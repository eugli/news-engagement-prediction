For those who may not recall, Bayer has donned a suburban mom bob, a sweater set, and a Stepford Wives -esque plastic grin for three years in a row now, to lampoon the frozen junk food brand. In 2015, she delivered the Super Bowl Activity Pack for Women . Last year, she kept her “hungry guys” fed with Totino’s pizza rolls up until she discovered they were shouting at a blank TV screen . This year, the Tostino’s wife, who’s never had a name, is getting a sensual foreign film makeover. The husband has once again changed and she no longer needs an activity pack to occupy her time during the “Big Game” because she’s got Sabine (Kristen Stewart) to help her out in the kitchen. Of course, even the torrid Super Bowl love affair isn’t complete without Totino’s pizza rolls.
