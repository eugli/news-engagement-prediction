We’re training just as hard. We’re fulltime athletes, we’re fulltime parents, fulltime workers.

Rebecca Young is crunched by the Queensland defence while playing for NSW last year. Picture: Peter Wallis Source: News Corp Australia \nYoung said the decision was even more significant because this match means so much to the players. \n“It’s more than just a game. Although we’re playing a game of footy, it’s the whole concept,” Young said. \n“The women’s team have been involved the whole way along. \n“I love the fact that we’re now not a curtain-raiser, we’re a double header. It just puts that emphasis on how important it is for our women as well.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
