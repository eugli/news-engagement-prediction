Earlier, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu wrote to Home Minister Rajnath Singh alleging sabotage in at least six train accidents. \n“We are yet to complete the investigations in India and only when we wrap this up will we go to Nepal to grill Hoda. He is an important lead for us, but there are many unconnected dots to be joined here,” a senior NIA official said. \nThe Nepal police were dismissive of India’s allegation that Hoda was working on the ISI’s behalf, but they confirmed that the accused regularly met a Paksitani, Shafi Sheikh, in Dubai. He told the police that he went to Karachi seven months ago and met three other people. \nKarachi link \n“Hoda is not sure about the association of Shafi and three others with Pakistan’s ISI, but he says he was asked to do something spectacular in India. He says he stayed in a bungalow in Karachi for two days where he was treated well and asked to rope in his local contacts to create trouble in India,” a Nepal police official told The Hindu on Tuesday. \nThree arrested \nIn January, the Bihar police arrested Moti Paswan, Uma Shanker Patel and Mukesh Yadav who allegedly planted the bomb, packed in a pressure cooker, on the railway track at Ghorasahan on October 1. \nDuring his interrogation, Paswan is alleged to have told the police that the ISI was involved in the Kanpur train accident on November 20, and he and two others had travelled to the accident site to place the IED. \nHowever, Director-General of Police, Uttar Pradesh, Javeed Ahmed had earlier told The Hindu that the statement of the accused could not be corroborated, and the preliminary investigations conducted by the State police did not find any trace of explosives on the tracks. \nHoda has emerged as a key catch for the NIA, which is investigating a “sabotage” or “terror” angle in the Kanpur train accident , in which more than 100 people were killed, and the Andhra Pradesh incident on January 21, in which 41 lost their lives. \nHoda moved to Dubai about three years ago when his real estate business failed. He suffered financial losses when he contested the elections on the Madhesi Party ticket, which he lost. \nIt is alleged that he made ₹50 lakh by pumping in fake currency into India. He then allegedly asked two persons, Deepak and Arun Ram, to plant explosives at Nakardehi in Bihar. \nWhen they failed, he hired one Braj Kishore Giri to kill them. He had asked the deceased to send newspaper clippings of the explosion to him on WhatsApp, the Nepal police said. \nThe official said Braj Kishore Giri, Mojahir Ansari and Shambhu, alias Laddu, were arrested after an encounter with the Nepal police, where they disclosed the names of their Indian associates who were then arrested by the Bihar police.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:22:50.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
