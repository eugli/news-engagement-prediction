This means you can leave your apartment's floor in a less-than-perfect state before work, and come back to a clean floor at night. The Roomba will self-dock after cleaning, too, so you won't need to look around your apartment for where it stopped cleaning, or where its battery died. \nThe Roomba 650 has a three-stage-cleaning system, with sensors that can detect dirtier parts of your floor and spend more time there. Those same sensors can determine whether the Roomba is cleaning hardwood floors or carpets, and clean accordingly. \nWhile it's smart enough to avoid walls and stairs, the Roomba is also smart enough to avoid parts of the house that you don't want it to clean thanks to a \"Virtual Wall\" sensor. \nYou set this external sensor down in an open door frame, and it sends out a signal that the Roomba perceives as a wall. This is a useful feature for homes and apartments with open floor plans, or if you choose to use the Roomba while you're home. \nThe Roomba is one of those products that's always in high demand, and rarely goes on sale. If you've been looking to save money when buying one, picking up a refurbished model is your best bet. iRobot Roomba 650 Automatic Robotic Vacuum (Certified Refurbished), $294.95, available at Amazon Disclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
