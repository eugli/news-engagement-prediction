In exchange, the Nets receive reserve guard Marcus Thornton , forward Andrew Nicholson and the Wizards’ lottery-protected 2017 first-round pick. The Nets were determined to receive a first-round pick in return for Bogdanovic, according to Wojnarowski . The move helps shore up Washington’s second unit as they look to solidify their standing in the Eastern Conference’s top half. It also provides the Nets a second first-round pick in 2017’s loaded draft, though they will be forced to swap their own with the Boston Celtics as a result of the Kevin Garnett-Paul Pierce trade. Bogdanovic is a streak shooter and scorer, averaging a modest 14.2 points on 35.7 percent three-point shooting for a league-worst Nets team (9-39). Brooklyn replaces his production with Thornton , who is averaging a career-worst 6.6 points per game though heralded as capable bench scorer for much of his NBA tenure. More to come.
