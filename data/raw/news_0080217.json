We do the jobs no one else wants to do.” \nAs Miranda notes, Latinos make up a large percentage of immigrants in the United States. Around 47 percent of immigrants living in the U.S. in 2015 were Hispanic, according to Pew Research Center data. *sits bolt upright* — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) February 17, 2017 \nMiranda, who is currently filming an upcoming “Mary Poppins” film in London , can’t make it to the opening night of “Hamilton” in San Francisco, so he’s having his parents step in to give the winner of the contest an unforgettable night. \n“You’ll be going with my mom and dad — Luz and Luis!” he wrote on the Prizeo site . “They’re the best and they’re going to make sure you have an incredible time.” \nThe contest offers a winner and a friend round-trip tickets to San Francisco, accommodations, two tickets to the opening night of “Hamilton” and access to the afterparty with the cast. Fans must donate at least $10 on the Prizeo site to enter, and donations will go toward Code2040 , an organization nurturing black and Latino talent in tech, and the Latino Community Foundation , which helps Latino-led philanthropic organizations. \nThe actor and composer has done several Prizeo campaigns in the past, raising funds for Planned Parenthood , the Hispanic Federation and the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History.
