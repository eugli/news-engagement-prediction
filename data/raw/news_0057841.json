Europe was founded precisely in order that France and Germany and others work together in a common project. \n“But this won't happen – it's just to say how crazy it will be if she is elected – that is why precisely it cannot happen, it won't happen, it must not happen.” \nMoscovici was dismissive of Le Pen’s chances of winning the second round of voting – meaning she would ultimately fall short of her aim to France’s next president. \nThe 59-year-old said: \"I'm confident. I know my citizens and my compatriots well and know they are not going to elect a candidate who is proposing France exiting (Europe). That would be the end of the European project. \n\"I cannot imagine 50 per cent of the French are crazy enough to vote for her. \n“I’m quite convinced that she cannot win... she never even ever won a regional election in France – never ever.\" Marion Le Pen in pictures Wed, July 27, 2016 The niece of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen has joined the military reserve and has urged \"young patriots\" to follow in her footsteps, take a look through her career to date, AFP/Getty Images 1 of 12 French far right Front National (National Front - FN) party's Parliament member and candidate for the regional elections in the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur (PACA) GETTY Pierre Moscovici claimed it would be 'crazy' if Le Pen is elected \nThe europhile urged former frontrunner Francois Hollande and independent candidate Emmanuel Macron to make a strong case from remaining in the EU if they harbour any ambitions of becoming the next president. \nHe said: \"The other candidates need to have a stronger campaign and show that they are credible to propose a future that is likeable for the French. \n\"I think the rise of Le Pen is a result of the disappointment in other candidates, so I urge them to make a strong proposal for France, and as well for Europe, and for France in Europe.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:23:58.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
