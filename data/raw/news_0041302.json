The party announced the hunger strike at all district offices of the party in Tamil Nadu. \nThe party's announcement comes a day after its working president MK Stalin was forced out from near Gandhi statue at Marina beach along with his partymen while sitting in protest yesterday. \nOn the other hand, former Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam has reached the Raj Bhavan today to meet Tamil Nadu Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao. \nOn Sunday morning, the party MLAs met at their headquarters and DMK leader Tiruchi Siva said the trust vote moved by Chief Minister yesterday was 'illegal'. \nSiva has confirmed that the party has submitted a memorandum on the issue to Tamil Nadu Governor who has promised to look into the matter. \n\"Sans participation of Opposition in Assembly, the trust vote moved by Chief Minister was passed.
