If you'd like to learn more... - \nPrior to their joint news conference, the two sides issued a joint statement on shared priorities that seemed to suggest the first in-person encounters between the prime minister and the U.S. president had gone well. \n“America is deeply fortunate to have a neighbour like Canada,” Trump said. \n“We share the same values, we share the love – a truly great love – of freedom…. American and Canadian troops have gone to battle together, fought wars together and forged the special bonds that come when two nations have shed their blood together.” \nThe lengthy joint statement indicates the two sides have agreed to work on improving labour mobility and trade across the Canada-U.S. border, expand preclearance agreements to cover cargo shipments and work on infrastructure projects in both countries. \nWATCH: Highlights of the Trump-Trudeau meeting Donald Trump calls North Korea a ‘big, big problem’ \nIt reflects a grasp of a “unique” partnership and a commitment to continue to strengthen ties for the mutual benefit of the two countries. \n“No other neighbours in the entire world are as fundamentally linked as we are,” Trudeau said. \n“We fought in conflict zones together, negotiated environmental treaties together … and we’ve entered into ground-breaking economic partnerships that have created good jobs for both of our peoples. \n“Canadians and Americans alike share a common history, as well as people-to-people ties that make us completely and totally integrated.” \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump’s handshakes are likely a show of power, experts say \nThe statement acknowledges that Canada is a vital foreign market for some 35 U.S. states, with more than $2 billion flowing across the border each day. \nThe statement also acknowledges a shared goal of “moving forward on energy infrastructure projects that will create jobs while respecting the environment.” \nIt also says the two sides plan to build on a number of areas of environmental co-operation, particularly along the border and the Great Lakes. We’ll work tirelessly to create growth and jobs in Canada & the US. Read our joint statement here: https://t.co/fNl9Q7Knyk \n— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) February 13, 2017 \nEarlier in the day, both leaders smiled and appeared to greet each other warmly as they shook hands at the door to the West Wing before the president ushered the prime minister inside. \nTrudeau was accompanied by a who’s who of the Canadian government, including Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Finance Minister Bill Morneau. \nTrudeau and his senior cabinet ministers are in Washington with one overarching goal: keep Canada out of the U.S president’s protectionist trade crosshairs. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump not ‘totally confident’ about the security of US-Canada border \nThat’s because Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, has mused about a border tax, and could bring back “Buy American” protectionism. \nThat is widely viewed as a major threat to the more than $2 billion in daily trade that flows across th world’s longest undefended border – the gateway to the biggest trading relationship on the planet. \nTrump acknowledged Monday that his bigger concern is the Mexican end of the trade deal, saying that the goal would be to “tweak” those elements affecting Canada in order to better streamline cross-border trade. \nREAD MORE: As Trudeau meets Trump, will Canada abandon Mexico? \nIan Lee, a professor at the Sprott School of Business at Carleton University in Ottawa, said it would be “childish and juvenile and irresponsible” for anyone to think Trudeau’s job is to go to Washington to preach Canadian values to Trump. \n“This is a profound misunderstanding of history, a profound misunderstanding of the role of the prime minister of Canada.” \nIndeed, Trudeau said as much Monday. \n“The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves,” he said. \nMy role, my responsibility, is to continue to govern in such a way that reflects Canadians’ approach and be a positive example in the world.” \nWATCH: Justin Trudeau says he’s not going to lecture U.S. on how to govern \nWhile setting the tone for a good personal relationship at the executive level will be a key goal of Trudeau’s, he will also be turning his attention to Congress – another key cog in the Canada-U.S. wheel. \nTrudeau will meet Paul Ryan, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \nTrump and Trudeau have talked on the phone a couple of times since the Nov. 8 presidential election. But the prime minister has steered clear of directly commenting on some of Trump’s controversial statements and actions, such as the ban on travellers from seven Muslim majority countries. \nLast week, Trudeau said he would be respectful in broaching areas where the two men disagree, and he pointed out there are issues where he sees eye-to-eye with Trump, such as creating jobs for the middle class. \nThe federal Liberals have also indicated they are willing to re-negotiate NAFTA, responding to a campaign promise by Trump to ditch the current accord. However, the scope and timing of the talks are not clear because several of Trump’s key cabinet players and officials are not yet in place. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:31:03.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
