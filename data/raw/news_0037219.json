(Photo: Provided by Portillo's) 1   \nIt’s official: popular Chicago hot dog and beef stand Portillo's wants to open a spot in Fishers. \nThe restaurant would be built on 3.2 acres on 116th Street just east of I-69, near the Ikea under construction and a proposed culinary campus. \nThe company filed a request for zoning approval with Fishers so it can build the stand, which would include a drive-thru window and outdoor seating. The request will be formally introduced to the city council at its regular meeting Monday night. \nIndyStar was the first to report on Jan. 4 that the company was seeking a Fishers location, but nothing official had been filed with the city at the time. \nFishers Mayor Scott Fadness said the company picked a desirable location and should do a brisk business. \n\"Portillo's is opening in an exciting, growing area of Fishers that's quickly becoming an experiential destination,\" Fadness said. \"The buzz that it's created is exciting, and we know it's a very popular culinary amenity for our residents.\" \nThe company said it would invest $3. 2 million in the building itself, and sales were expected to be about $4 million to $6 million a year. \n“With the development of Portillo’s at this location, the citizens of Fishers will see an expanded selection of options for family dining,” Portillo’s said in a summary of its proposal to the city. “This pairs well with the retail and recreational uses planned on the north side of 116th Street, as well as across I-69.” \nConstruction should begin in the spring and the restaurant could open in the fall. \nPortillo’s serves Italian beef and sausages dipped in juice and smothered with spicy giardiniera and hot and sweet peppers, as well as hot dogs on poppy seed buns stacked with mustard, relish, onions, celery salt, a pickle spear, tomato slices and “sport” peppers. \nThe company has 46 operating restaurants, each employing about 120 people. There is just one other location in Indiana: in Lake County. Portillo’s first stand was in Villa Park, Ill., and its first Chicago location was opened at Clark and Ontario streets in 1994. \nCall IndyStar reporter John Tuohy at (317) 444-6418.
