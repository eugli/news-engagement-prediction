Or why your sister never seems to put on weight, but you do? The answer could lie in whether you are a first-born, middle child or youngest sibling. Research shows that our life chances are moulded in extraordinary ways from day one — depending on where you sit in the family order. It could explain why the Duchess of Cambridge is taller than her sister Pippa, how David Cameron became Prime Minister — and why Beyonce was destined for stardom. In a study published last week by Edinburgh University, first-born children were found to display more intelligence than their younger siblings. Other studies show they are also likely to be taller and to live longer. Scientists have also discovered that middle children are the most likely to achieve high political office, while the youngest are more likely than their older brothers and sisters to seek stardom on stage or screen. Decades of in-depth investigation has produced a wealth of data that reveals exactly how the odds are stacked for every one of us, as JOHN NAISH reveals... Intelligence first In IQ tests, first-borns score between 1.5 and 2 points higher, on average, than second-born children, according to studies of more than 270,000 siblings by psychologists in Germany and Norway. This finding, confirmed by the Edinburgh study, seems to be a result of parents investing more time and effort in their precious firstborns — stimulating their mental development through talking, reading, music and play. Further research uncovers that if a first-born dies in infancy, the second-born child’s IQ rises to match that of their lost sibling, as parental attention is transferred to them. In theory, all this should mean that Britain is getting brighter, as smaller families mean 40 per cent of people in the UK are first-borns. In IQ tests, first-borns score between 1.5 and 2 points higher, on average, than second-born children (file image) Height advantage First-borns tend to be taller than their second, third and fourth siblings, by 0.4cm, 0.7cm and 0.8 cm respectively, according to a Swedish study. This, too, may be due to greater parental investment in early children, including ensuring they eat a good, balanced diet. The top jobs First-borns’ slight lead in IQ grows into a huge advantage in educational opportunities, making them 16 per cent more likely to go on to higher education than their siblings, says Dr Feifei Bu, social researcher at Essex University. First-borns go on to claim 43 per of senior boardroom roles, while youngest siblings occupy only 23 per cent. Eldest children also hold a disproportionately high number of posts as surgeons. Surprisingly, first-borns are also more than 3.5 times more likely than their siblings to become rock stars, according to a survey of leading UK personalities past and present by the British statistician Dr Geoff Ellis. It is thought the extra attention lavished on them could give be what gives these first-borns the confidence they need to become stars. Beyoncé, Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney are all prime examples. Beyoncé and Mick Jagger are all prime examples of eldest siblings who had the confidence to become stars Wealth-makers Statistician Dr Ellis has found that only-children are least likely to become self-made millionaires. This is most likely because they’ve not grown up with the competitive desire to outdo siblings, which drives entrepreneurs. In the earnings stakes, first-borns again enjoy an initial advantage. Thanks to their better education, they earn 14 per cent more than their siblings in their first jobs. The good news for younger brothers and sisters is that their earnings tend to catch up after ten years in the workplace, says a report last year by Italian researchers in the journal Demography. It says that later-born children are more likely than firstborns to switch jobs in pursuit of better pay, in order to emulate the example set by their eldest sibling. Miss Pushy Sharp-elbowed, first-born girls are 13 per cent more ambitious than first-born boys, Dr Bu’s research shows. In surveys, they were significantly more likely to say that they were aiming to pursue higher education — and then the top jobs that follow. Angela Merkel, Hillary Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, and JK Rowling are all female first-borns.

This appears to be a negative effect of having pushy parents Having to spend lots of time indoors as a child poring over schoolbooks is a known risk factor for myopia, says Professor Jeremy Guggenheim, of the Cardiff School of Optometry and Visual Sciences. The suggestion is that by spending more time indoors, they are deprived of sunlight, which is important for eye development.
