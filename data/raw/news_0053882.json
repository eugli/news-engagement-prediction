has defended the recent racism storyline after he faced a backlash from viewers. \nThe BBC soap tackled racism and xenophobia in a Brexit -fuelled plot which saw the words ‚ÄúPoles go home‚Äù graffitied on the Queen Vic after a Polish themed night at the pub. \nA group of locals were seen crowded round the venue in Tuesday night‚Äôs episode as Danny Dyer ‚Äôs character Mick Carter attempted to jet spray the offensive message off of the door. \nDenise Fox (Diane Parish) asked ‚Äúwhat on earth is going on in this place?‚Äù before Konrad Topolski (Piotr Baumann) said: ‚ÄúIt is the Britain we live in now.‚Äù \nOne viewer described the scene as ‚Äúbeyond disgusting‚Äù while others accused the BBC of having an anti-Brexit agenda with one writing: ‚ÄúIncredible #Brexit bashing storyline on #EastEnders this evening. Normally this is The One Show territory. Prime time unabashed BBC bias.‚Äù \nRichardson tweeted in defence of the storyline after one viewer asked him to ‚Äúnot write for this soap again‚Äù.
