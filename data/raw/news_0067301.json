(de Borja did not return until the fourth quarter). And not when Shoreham-Wading River got within four points at the 2:59 mark of the fourth quarter.

Dwyer had a game-high 13 points as No. 2 and host Harborfields held off No. 3 Shoreham-Wading River, 49-35, in a Class A girls basketball semifinal, Tuesday night. \n“I had a lot of faith in Falyn and my teammates,” said de Borja, who picked up a technical foul and her third personal foul with 3:54 left in the second quarter and Harborfields leading 13-11. “I knew they would do fine. This team is not just one person.” \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nDwyer was aggressive attacking the basket and scored seven points in the third quarter. Senior Kate Tardo (4 points, 4 assists) took over the ballhandling duties for de Borja, and senior forward Grace Zagaja was a force underneath the basket all night with 10 points (4 in the third quarter) and 23 rebounds. \nWhen Zagaja, who is going to the Naval Academy, was told of rebounding numbers she was surprised. \n“I did,” Zagaja asked. \n“She’s a garbage can for us. She cleans everything up,” said Dwyer with a laugh of Zagaja. “I mean that in the most positive way.” \nThe Tornadoes, whose only loss came on Jan. 17 against Comsewogue, seemed in control. But SWR (18-3) scored 11 of the first 14 points of the fourth quarter and trailed 39-35 with 2:59 to play. Mikayla Dwyer and Mackenzie Zajac each had nine points for Shoreham.

We’re only up four and it seems like we should be up by 1,000,” Harborfields coach G. Davis Lavey said. “But I’m always confident with our tough defense and our seniors.” Enter your email address to subscribe to Newsday's Sports Now newsletter ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:06:28.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
