I'm really happy with the win and the jersey obviously, this is a special race to me and its great motivation for the whole team,\" Cavendish said after the race. \nThe opening stage of the Abu Dhabi Tour presented the crowd with the sprint finale they were expecting and it was the superior leadout that won the stage on Thursday. \nWhen the early breakaway of the stage was reeled in with 15km to go, the respective sprint teams began to organise their sprint trains. \nTeam Dimension Data for Qhubeka remained calm at the rear of the peloton, waiting for the right time to move up. \nAfter Daniel Teklehaimanot did a mountain of work to bring back the early breakaway, it was Igor Anton that led the African Team to the head of affairs with just 10km to go. \nIt was a tough battle to stay organised at the front of the race as the wide road made it easy for teams to move up the sides of the peloton. \nJohann van Zyl and Bernhard Eisel were going shoulder to shoulder with the other trains as Reinardt Janse van Rensburg, Mark Renshaw and Cavendish stayed in the wheel. \nIt was extremely difficult to keep in formation but Eisel marshaled the troops well. With 4km to go the Austrian powerhouse brought Janse van Rensburg, Renshaw and Cavendish back to the head of the race. \nA strong pull by Eisel then had DiData's finishing trio head into the all-important final left hand corner with 1km to go first. \nIn the corner there was a crash but as DiData were leading, Cavendish was unaffected. \nThe South African champion then turned on the power down the finishing straight before giving way to Renshaw, who began the kick for the line. \nBonifazio realised he was behind the 8-ball at this point and decided to go early from two places back, but all this did was provide Cavendish with the final slingshot to take the victory. © supersport.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:46:00.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
