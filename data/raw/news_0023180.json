By the time she finally got to the dental hospital in Melbourne, the damage was irreversible.\nThe vicious attack left the teenager with nine missing teeth.\nThis attack was just one in the abusive relationship, but she would wear its physical signs for three years.\nThe missing teeth also served as a daily reminder of the attack. Picture: Jesse Black. Source: Supplied \nUnable to afford replacing her missing teeth, Jesse has been forced to endure the uncomfortable stare of strangers. This has taken a toll on her confidence and daily life.\n“For the first year, I was really self-conscious everyone was staring at me,” she told news.com.au.\n“Especially straight after it happened and I had stitches all throughout my gums. It was really hard to go out in public. I normally just got called a junkie, because I was extremely underweight at the time as well.\n“I haven’t been able to get a job because I didn’t have any teeth. Most employers would look at me, and then as soon as I would walk away they would say, ‘You didn’t get the job.’”\nSick of the treatment, Jesse started a change.org petition, and the support was overwhelming.\nThrough the kind-hearted donations of strangers, Jesse raised more than $27,000.\n“I was surprised how the petition was received. I didn’t think it would get the support it did,” Jesse said.\n“There were quite a few messages of support that really jumped out. There was a lady who had also gone through a similar situation and she had no teeth either.”\nThanks to the donations, Jesse was able to afford every session and appointment.\nIn a few short weeks she will receive her dentures. She is excited for the new chapter of her life to begin.\n“On the 27th of February I pick up my teeth. I took a photo of my teeth when they were in my mouth. They haven’t had their metal parts attached to it yet, the dentists were just making sure I was comfortable with it. My life improved as soon as I saw my smile. I was very happy, I felt like crying.”\nJesse’s new smile wouldn’t have been possible without the donation of strangers. Picture: Jesse Black Source: Supplied \nJesse said she was beyond thankful to everyone that reached out to her and hopes others in her situation, or similar, will be able to get the treatment they need and deserve.\n*Name changed to protect identity.\nIf you or someone you know is in need help, contact the National Domestic Violence Service at 1800 737 732 or call Lifeline on 13 11 14", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T10:21:52.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
