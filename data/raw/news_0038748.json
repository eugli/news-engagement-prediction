Slot to Georgia Links \nSTOCKBRIDGE, Ga. -- Edge rusher Brenton Cox (Stockbridge, Ga./Stockbridge) has seen his stock skyrocket in the last few months, with the 6-foot-4, 235-pound prospect now ranked as the No. 51 overall prospect in the country by the 247Sports Composite. Cox joined the SEC Recruiting Buzz to discuss which program currently sticks out to him. \n\"You already know it is the home-state Georgia,\" Cox said. \"They keep impressing me, day-by-day. Then South Carolina and Ohio State.\" \nCox listed three reasons why the Bulldogs have emerged as the early frontrunner in his recruitment. First, the pitch for Cox to follow in the footsteps of Leonard Floyd , Jordan Jenkins , Davin Bellamy , and Lorenzo Carter . \n\"Their playing style,\" Cox said. \"That 3-4 defense is really what I look for, with my playing type. That is definitely the pitch - they have had other players who play like me with a style similar to mine.\" \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?

It is the hometown. Georgia, and Atlanta Falcons, we were brought up on them. I love my hometown.\" \nThe Bulldogs' coaching staff also plays a role in Georgia leading for Cox. \n\"I have a great relationship with Kirby Smart ,\" Cox said. \"They are starting to work well together, I think in the next few years they will click. They have a good coaching staff.\" \nCox admits the thought of committing has crossed his mind. \n\"I have thought about it a lot of times,\" Cox said. \"That is not something I can put a date on because I could wake up one morning and feel like committing. I think about it every day actually.\" \nNote: This interview was conducted last week, just prior to the departure of defensive line coach Tracy Rocker . \nListen to the full interview above, which Cox discussing other programs and includes a breakdown of him as a prospect and insight into his recruitment.
