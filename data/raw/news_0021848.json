Freeman's desire to play for Canada was something he had expressed in the past, but the reasoning for choosing Canada over the U.S. had a special significance for Freeman and his family. \nOn Wednesday, Freeman took to Twitter and offered a heartfelt explanation. He will honor his mother, Rosemary, who died after a battle with melanoma when he was 10 years old. Can not be more excited to represent Canada at the WBC next month! ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦Here is a just a brief background of my parents. pic.twitter.com/vpkH1UtUfu â€” Freddie Freeman (@FreddieFreeman5) February 9, 2017 \nHe wrote: \nBoth my parents were born in Canada. My mother in Toronto and my father in Windsor. My dad moved to California when he was 12 because my grandfather got transferred there for his job. There were there 3 years and my grandfather got transferred back to Windsor. My dad was in Windsor for 15 months before my grandfather got transferred back to California permanently. I'm thankful for those 15 months because that's when my dad met my mother. Long story short, my parents got married in Oshawa a few years later and made their home in California. My mother passed away when I was 10 years old of melanoma skin cancer. It is going to be a very emotional day for me when I put on that Canada uniform come March 9th. I carry my mother with me everyday and I can't wait to represent her by playing in her honor. Thank you team Canada for letting me play to honor her and my family!! \nThe World Baseball Classic begins on March 6.
