(Photo: Steven Senne, AP) \nWheaton College in Massachusetts just announced the founding of a new full ride scholarship for a refugee student from one of the seven nations named in President Trump’s recent executive order: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen. \nThe Wheaton Refugee Scholarship will prioritize eligible students who are seeking to come to the U.S. in the case the executive order is suspended. If the travel ban remains, the scholarship will go to a refugee currently in the U.S. who is from one of these seven or other “war-torn nations,” according to the scholarship page . \nThe college administration acted “almost immediately” over the weekend to announce its strong support of students from refugee backgrounds and their unique perspectives, Wheaton College President Dennis Hanno told USA TODAY College. Related: How universities are responding to Trump’s travel ban \n“When the executive order was issued, our thought and response to it really centered not on the debate about whether politically it’s the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do. [We thought,] ‘What does it mean for our community?'” Hanno told USA TODAY College. “Scholarships are about the way you want to shape your community. You spend your scholarships dollars in way that helps you bring what you need to your campus.” \nAdvertised as a response to threatened diversity on campus, the scholarship offers full financial award to a single student each year as a way of including a population currently under political scrutiny. \n“The current executive order on immigration, which was signed on Friday, January 27, endangers the broadly diverse learning environment that is essential to our mission,” the official announcement states. “This new policy implies that international students are neither needed nor wanted. This is false, and we must counter that divisive message.” \nWheaton called upon political leaders and other higher education institutions to follow suit as well, broadcasting a similar message of inclusivity by opposing the travel ban and highlighting the need for various cultural viewpoints in a college setting. \nHanno explained a couple of key ways others can continue this mission of inclusivity. \n“It’s twofold,” he said. “One, it’s reinforcing what other colleges are already doing, but also encouraging more colleges to think about proactive ways to keep the doors open to students from all over the world in the United States.” \nA current campaign to create education scholarships for displaced Syrian students called Books not Bombs has over 150 college and universities publicized as participants on their website.
