And it has safety measures built in: You can report users, you have to connect to your social media to join, and people can’t see your specific meeting location until you’ve approved them. \nAnd to be clear, this is not a dating app. There’s no sell-yourself profile; just designate your age and gender, describe yourself in 140 characters or less, pop in a few photos and you're set. \nThe app even has a filter to lower your risk of getting matched with someone with less-than-platonic intentions. You can specify what ages and genders you'd prefer to have join you (male, female and/or genderfluid), and then only people who meet those parameters will be able to see your ask. From there, you get to pick whom to strike up a conversation with. \nA long-incubated idea, now reality \nJackson’s “Book of Mormon” experience was just one in a long line of incidents that inspired Stand-in, a series of “missed connections with friends” and difficulties making plans. \nShe's tried other electronic ways of finding people to hang out with—Craiglist's \"Strictly platonic\" section, Tinder while traveling (\"Don't ever do that,\" she said)—but never quite got the responses she wanted. After the need for the app really hit her in April 2016, she took matters into her own hands. \nDespite a lack of experience with app development, Jackson threw herself fully into making Stand-in a reality. She said she’s had early mornings and late nights working on the app before and after going to her full-time job in insurance. She raised $5,563 for the project with Kickstarter, she’s been speaking with investors, and to lower production costs, she bought a $99 software for wireframing—designing blueprints for the app's pages, button functionalities, etc.—taught herself and created it all in three weeks. \nJackson brought on a small team of developers to actually build the app, three of whom are still with the project for updates. She also enlisted the help of Luveta Hill, a friend with experience with platform testing and social media apps. (Fun fact: The two met almost four years ago while looking for workout buddies on the Meetup app.) \n“We would do usability testing, user experience testing, to make sure that all the functionality worked, and then I know [Jackson] got a small group of people together to actually start creating events so we could see how it would look and feel and then, once it launched, in real time creating events and meeting up with people and using the app that way,” said Hill, a 31-year-old Logan Square resident. \nThey only marketed the app in Chicagoland for its soft launch, but Jackson hopes to someday have it go global: \"I want to be able to go to Paris and if whoever I'm with doesn't feel like going out, I can say, 'Hey, who wants to be a tourist for the day?' \" Stand-In Lenny Gilmore / RedEye \nPutting it to the test \nSince it officially launched in early November, the app's had about 240 Stand-in requests, and Jackson said each request has drawn about six responses. She's not yet able to track how many actual Stand-ins have happened. \nJackson herself has gone on five Stand-ins so far. Three were events she posted, successfully matching with women who didn't know her (or that she was the app's founder) and were just interested in trying something new. \nLindsay Martin, a 28-year-old Lakeview resident, was Jackson's match for the very first Stand-in back in November. Jackson had a coupon for a free SoulCycle class and wanted someone to come along, and Martin had been told she should try SoulCycle for her triathlon training and figured it was a good opportunity to do so and make a new friend. The two met up, chatted for a while, enjoyed the class and have remained in touch since. \n\"It was really cool to get outside my own comfort zone as well as accompany somebody that's getting outside of theirs, from not only a fitness standpoint but also a social standpoint, like you're kind of putting yourself out there and hoping for the best,\" Martin said. \nMartin has not yet been on another Stand-in, but she said it was because of a lack of time, not interest, and she plans to use it again in the future. \n\"I lived in New York two years ago, and had this app been around, I don't know if I'd necessarily would have moved back to Chicago just because, you know, [I] didn't really have a good social stronghold keeping me in the city, and it was very isolating,\" Martin said. \"And I feel like this app has the opportunity to change that for the better. When people go to different cities and up and move and they're super excited and don't necessarily have the social group to hold on to, this kind of helps them with that.\" \nTry it yourself \nReady to try Stand-in? Jackson and Hill offered the same advice for posting requests: Be specific. Include details such as why you want a Stand-in (“My friend bailed,” “This place is by my house and I’ve wanted to try it,” etc.) and whether you already have a ticket or the respondent will need to get one. \nYou can post requests up to 14 days in advance, but Jackson said two to three days out has so far been the “sweet spot.” \nAnd though it might be tempting to just sit back and wait to join someone else’s request, remember that there are probably a bunch of people out there doing the same thing, so if you don’t see many (or any) posts, put one out there yourself. \n“...If there's something you want to do and you don't see it, create it, 'cause someone's gonna want to join you,\" Jackson said. \"... Have fun, share with your friends, enjoy the experience.\" \nSave", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:58:47.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
