would do anything for her gay brother, Michael, including leaving the Catholic church (along with the rest of her family) in which she grew up in, telling British GQ, \"Why should I support an organization that has a limited view of my beloved brother?\" The Hollywood starlet, who recently played Fantine in \"Les Misérables,\" (she joked that her short haircut left her looking like her gay brother) has been a fervent support of the LGBT community, receiving the HRC's \"Ally For Equality\" award in 2008 (VIDEO). Despite her very public divorce from Tammy Lynn Michaels last year, Melissa Etheridge and Michaels share twins, daughter Johnnie Rose and son Miller. The rockstar also has two other children, daughter Bailey and son Beckett, from a previous relationship. \"Glee\" mastermind and creator Ryan Murphy ended 2012 and began 2013 by welcoming his first son, Logan Phineas Miller Murphy, with his husband, photographer David Miller. Murphy announced the new addition to his family via Twitter with a picture of the newborn, tweeting, \"Thanks to everyone for the kind wishes. Logan is one week old and doing great. Happy new year!\" Cher, no stranger to the LGBT community, became a gay icon for her lesbian role in the 1983 movie \"Silkwood.\" The singer, songwriter, actress and philantrhopist has two children, Elijah Blue Allman and Chaz Bono, who is transgender. Bishop Gene Robinson, the first non-celibate openly-gay Anglican bishop has two children, Jaymee and Ella with his ex-wife Isabella \"Boo\" McDaniel. After coming out at 40-years-old and meeting his lifetime partner Mark Andrew, Robinson remained close to McDaniel and their two daughters. When B.D. Wong isn't busy playing his famous role of Dr. George Huang on \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\", he's busy being a father to his son Jackson Foo along with his longtime partner Richie Jackson. Born 11 weeks premature via surrogate, Jackson Foo was born a twin with his brother Boaz Dov, who unfortunately died 90 minutes after birth. In 2003, Wong released a memoir chronicling the harrowing birth of his son. Barbra Streisand has one son, Jason, who is gay, with ex-husband actor Elliott Gould. She also has two step-children with her second husband James Brolin. In an interview with Pride Source, when Barbra Streisand was asked how she felt about being labeled a \"gay icon\" and if her gay son Jason thinks of her as one, she responded, \"He doesn't see me as an icon. He sees me as his mother who touches his hair too much. No -- I love being an icon to anybody. Equal rights, you know!\" LGBT activist Zach Wahls was born to lesbian moms via artificial insemination. During the 2012 presidential election he spoke at the Democratic National Convention on behalf of President Barack Obama for his support of same sex marriage. Better known as \"the other Tyra\" -- Tyra Sanchez -- who won the second season of the widely popular hit show \"RuPaul's Drag Race,\" is the only Drag Race contestant to have a biological child, openly speaking about his son, Jeremiah, while in the competition. A documentary called \"Drag Dad\" by Björn Flóki (VIDEO), chronicles the young father's life and relationship with his son and has yet to be released. Designer and HGTV host Vern Yip and his partner have two children, Gavin Joshua Mannix and Vera Lillian Beatrix. Both children were born via surrogate. Houston's first openly-gay mayor Annise Parker has three children, Daniela, Marquitta, and Jovon with her domestic partner of over two decades, Kathy Hubbard. Their two daughters are adopted and their son is a foster child. Sally Field is a mother of three young men, one who is gay. \"It's important to have a parent speak about raising a magnificent, proud, intelligent, funny, loveable, sexy gay son. There are so many parents who are frightened of that and who don't embrace their children and they struggle to embrace who they are and what nature intended them to be,\" says Field during her interview on \"Oprah's Next Chapter\". Much like her provocative, yet endearing character on \"Glee,\" Jane Lynch never imagined she'd be a mother. In 2010, when Lynch tied the knot with her wife, Lara Embry, a clinical psychologist, she also became the stepmother of two girls, Chase and Haden. “I’m almost 50, and I thought that possibility was behind me, so this is a real delight,” Lynch told The New York Times about her becoming a parent. The couple who started the prolific \"It Gets Better\" Project, Dan Savage and Terry Miller, have a son together named D.J. via adoption. In December 2012, the two got their marriage license in their home state of Washington, which passed same-sex marriage in the 2012 general election. One of our favorite out comedians, Wanda Sykes, and her wife, Alex, welcomed twins, daughter Olivia Lou and son Lucas Claude (Alex is French), in May 2009. “What I have learned so far, is that the Octomom is out of her freaking mind,\" Sykes said in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times. \"With two babies we are -- and there’s two of us -- we are pulling our hair out. We’re loving every minute of it. It is truly a blessing.\" The Hollywood power couple, Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, have four children, of which their eldest, Stephen Ira Beatty is transgender. Stephen made a video for transgender blog site, \"We Happy Trans,\" back in March of 2012. In February 2012, Matt Bomer came out by acknowledging his family -- three sons and his partner, Simon Halls -- in a speech when he received the New Generation Arts and Activism Award for his work in the fight against HIV/AIDS. \"I'd really especially like to thank my beautiful family: Simon, Kit, Walker, Henry,\" he continued. \"Thank you for teaching me what unconditional love is. You will always be my proudest accomplishment.\" Zachary Jackson Levon Furnish-John is the son of multi award-winning singer Sir Elton John and husband, David Furnish. Zachary, who was born on December 2010, is the couple's first child. In January, false reports of the two having a second child surfaced. Their PR rep told E! News that John and Furnish did not welcome another child. However, a week later they confirmed they did indeed welcome a second child, Elijah Joseph Daniel Furnish-John. In January, Rosie O'Donnell welcomed her first child, Dakota, with second wife, Michelle Rounds, tweeting the news and sharing an Instagram shot of the three for the first time. Dakota makes this O'Donnell's fifth child. The comedian shares four other children -- Blake, Vivienne, Parker and Chelsea -- with ex-wife Kelli Carpenter. We've always loved Ricky. So when he came out and opened up his life to the world in an exclusive April 2012 issue of the Spanish edition of Vanity Fair, we fell deeper in love with the Latino pop sensation. During the interview, Martin candidly spoke about his coming out moment, work and his family; introducing his sons, Matteo and Valentino, and his partner, Carlos. Openly gay comic Alec Mapa and his husband, Jamison Hebert, became fathers when they adopted their son in 2010. Mapa, who often jokes about his biracial LGBT family is also the celebrity spokesman for RaiseAChild.US, an organization that encourages same-sex couples to foster or adopt children. Bisexual Canadian actress and \"True Blood\" star Anna Paquin has fraternal twins born last September with her husband Steven Moyer. The co-stars also have two other children from Moyer's previous relationships. \"Sex and the City\" star Cynthia Nixon, along with her wife, Christine Marinoni, have three children. Two, Charles and Samantha, are from Nixon's previous relationship with photographer Danny Mozes, and the other is Max Ellington, whom Marinoni gave birth to in February 2011.  シェア", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:11:56.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
