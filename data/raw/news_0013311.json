It is a bad rule for consumers. This is like putting only healthy food on the menu, because unhealthy food tastes good but you still shouldn’t eat it because you might die younger,” Gary Cohn, the White House National Economic Council Director said about the fiduciary rule, Vanity Fair reported.\nBefore taking his role at the White House, Mr Cohn was the president and chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs.\nIn a 2015 speech at the Jack Welch College of Business, he said it felt like he was in Congress every other week, trying to convince them to repeal regulations.", "external_links": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/trump-says-he-cut-wall-street-reform-because-his-friends-need-money", "http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/trump-says-he-cut-wall-street-reform-because-his-friends-need-money&quot;", "http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BarackObama&quot;", "http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/wall-street", "http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump&quot;", "http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BarackObama", "http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump", "http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/wall-street&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zifw9EMDPyyKhhc0l5mZig--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/the_independent_577/061a306cdb785ea05c4b8ecd5981dfbd"], "published": "2017-02-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:35:26.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
