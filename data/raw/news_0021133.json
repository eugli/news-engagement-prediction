Not only do they bellow out the Gerrard chant home and way but they've now unveiled a brand spanking new banner commemorating that moment. (Ba opens the scoring as a result from Gerrard's mistake.) (The skipper is dejected following Ba's goal.) \nAs United seek to gain ground on their Merseyside rivals at home to Watford, they'll be doing so in front of a new banner which will be unfolded at Old Trafford. \nThe banner depicts a picture of United duo Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard performing the dab alongside Gerrard's 'version'. Check it out below: \nBrutal! \nWhat do you make of it? Funny or too much? \nLet us know in the comments section below.
