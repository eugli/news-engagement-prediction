Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have set all sorts of Euro goal records \nBarcelona ’s Argentine maestro Messi faces Paris Saint-Germain tonight with 93 Champions League goals to his name. \nKeep up to date with ALL the football gossip and transfers \nAnd Real Madrid ’s Portuguese Galactico Ronaldo takes on Napoli in the Bernabeu tomorrow on top of the pile with 95. \nAn indication of the magnitude of their achievements is that just two other men — Raul and Ruud van Nistelrooy — have ever scored more than 50 goals in the competition, the pair having bagged 71 and 56 respectively. \nAnd those two were specialist goal poachers. Messi and Ronaldo are so much more. \nMessi has notched a record seven Champions League hat-tricks — including trebles against Manchester City and Celtic this season. \nSo after netting ten goals in this season’s group stage, he could challenge Ronaldo’s record of 17 in a single season, which was set three years ago as the Madrid giants won the tenth of their 11 European crowns. \nIf their goalscoring stats are jaw-dropping, then Ronaldo and Messi also rank highly in the list of Champions League assists. EPA Barca superstar Lionel Messi needs just seven goals to reach his Euro century EPA Real legend Ronaldo is the top Champions League scorer with 95 goals \nThe supposedly “greedy” Ron is joint top with 30, while Messi stands third with 24. And raw data does not do either man justice — the majesty of Messi in full flow and the supreme athleticism of a rampaging Ronaldo marks both men out as players for the ages. \nIt is little surprise that they have carved up World Footballer of the Year honours between them for nine years now. In its various guises, Messi has won five of the awards and Ronaldo four. Getty Images Ronaldo hopes to beat Messi to be the first 100-goal Champions League scorer Getty Images 6 Ronaldo bagged the shootout winner against Atletico in the 2016 final \nIt is not hyperbole to suggest we are quite possibly witnessing the two greatest footballers ever to have played the game — a claim which probably only Pele and Diego Maradona can contest. \nOver the past decade, Messi and Ronaldo have carried off three Champions League winner’s medals apiece — and few would look past either of the La Liga giants to lift the famous Old Big Ears trophy again this year.
