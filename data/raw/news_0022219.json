He was one of two finalists for the position.\nIn an interview on Thursday afternoon, Cooper told POLITICO that he wasn’t prepared to undergo the grueling confirmation process. “Life is too good and too short,” he said.\nIn his formal statement on the decision to withdraw, Cooper added: “After witnessing the treatment that my friend Jeff Sessions, a decent and honorable man who bears only good will and good cheer to everyone he meets, had to endure at the hands of a partisan opposition that will say anything and do anything to advance their political interests, I am unwilling to subject myself, my family, and my friends to such a process.”\nGorsuch calls Trump's judge attacks 'demoralizing' and 'disheartening' By Josh Dawsey and Seung Min Kim\nKellyanne Conway’s husband, George T. Conway, has been reported as the other finalist being considered for the role. The White House has yet to announce a nominee and a spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nConway, a partner at the New York City law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, is perhaps best known for the behind-the-scenes role he played in the Paula Jones saga during Bill Clinton’s presidency – it was Conway who, along with a small cadre of elite lawyers, wrote Jones’ successful appeal to the Supreme Court, which set the legal precedent allowing a sitting president to be sued in civil court.\nThe White House was divided between the two candidates, with Kellyanne Conway and others advocating for her husband and another camp, led by Sessions, making the case for Cooper.\n“George is a brilliant and accomplished lawyer who is willing to serve this president. At the same time, I've been quiet about the specific roles for him partly because of my role here and because the attorney general has not been confirmed,” Conway told POLITICO earlier this week. “He's willing to serve and I know that's a decision he's made. He would be the first Asian solicitor general, but he could also be a judge.”\nThe solicitor general is responsible for representing the federal government before the Supreme Court, arguing on its behalf in cases in which the government is a party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:18:27.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
