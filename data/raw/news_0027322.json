The person was Michael Flynn. The post was national security adviser . And the reason was that he discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office – this after promising otherwise to Vice President Mike Pence. Such contacts could run afoul of the Logan Act , which bans private citizens from engaging in foreign policy.\nHere are some remaining questions:\n- Are Flynn's contacts with Russian officials the reason President Vladimir Putin declined to retaliate when the United States imposed additional sanctions on Russia in the waning days of the Obama administration?\n- Did Flynn act alone, or did someone higher up in Trump's circle instruct or authorize, tacitly or otherwise, these interactions?\n- Where does this leave relations between the United States and Russia?\nHow it's playing out in Russia : Senior Russian lawmaker Leonid Slutsky said it was clear that Flynn had been forced to resign in an effort to damage relations between Russia and the United States.\nThe half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been killed in Malaysia, the Yonhap News Agency and other South Korean media outlets reported, citing unidentified sources.

Baseball fans have seen this movie before.\nA South Korean special prosecutor's office is seeking an arrest warrant for Samsung leader Jay Y. Lee.

In a federal court in Seattle, the state of Washington, which has argued that the ban discriminates against Muslims, will attempt to probe the president's motive in drafting the order. In the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, judges will decide whether to reconsider the Trump administration's appeal in that same case decided last week.\nAround the world\nIndonesian authorities in parts of the Muslim-majority nation have confiscated condoms and banned students from celebrating Valentine's Day, saying the romantic tradition encourages casual sex and runs counter to cultural norms.\nThe U.N.
