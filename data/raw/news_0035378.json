So by first week of March we will roll them out,” he said. \nAdeshola explained that the introduction of uniforms, name tags and badges had become necessary to enforce decorum and ensure safety of duly registered members and members of the public. \nAccording to him, with the vital information on the badge, any conductor involved in crime can easily be identified and apprehended. \nThe national president explained that the novel idea was being experimented in Lagos State before other states can take a cue. \n(NAN) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T14:50:14.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
