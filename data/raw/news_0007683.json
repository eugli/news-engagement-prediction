The information posted stuck around for six years. LIZ MCDONALD \nOn top of the task of finding a house in a tight market, renters also face extensive checks. \nLandlords can register for an \"A-alert\" that emails them if tenants start looking for other houses and, in the process, their details are loaded in the TINZ database. \nLandlords, who agree to abiding by the Privacy Act, get money credited for loading photos of tenants or ratings of them. \nTINZ boss Ian Barker said the company, with \"less than 1900\" landlords on its books, had an independent audit of its privacy procedures done in 2016 and only minor changes were needed. STUFF \nThere are many checks before tenants can lay down the welcome mat. \nThe subjectivity of comments was moderated by a tick-box system - rather than open comments - that outlined factors including tidiness, consideration to neighbours, and rent promptness, he said. \nRenters could request the information held on them and on \"a couple of occasions\" had managed to get information removed. \nBarker said the database was set up to help landlords find good tenants for their properties. \n\"We think most tenants are great but there are people who damage houses and don't pay rent.\" \nKayla Healey, from from renters lobby group Renters United, said the database was a form of discrimination. \n\"We think when ranking, rating and posting photos of tenants to be shared around private landlords and property managers, there is a fine line between necessary information about a prospective tenant and information that could lead to discrimination.\" \nPhotos opened the door to their race or gender being being a factor in whether or not they got a home, she said. \nWhile there were some bad tenants to be avoided, the database - dubbed the bad tenant database - felt \"like it focuses on the negative side of things.\" \nA spokeswoman from the Office of Privacy Commissioner John Edwards said it had not examined the business process or systems of TINZ. \nBut if TINZ was giving people access to their information when requested, then this would be consistent with its obligations under the Act, she said. \n\"We would advise landlords to not take information from databases like this in isolation. If you find something in the TINZ database that you don't like the look of, put it to the tenant first â€“ they may have a valid explanation that gives a different side of the story.\" \nDuring the 2014-2015 year, the Tenancy Tribunal received 19,095 applications, 16,808 initiated by landlords. - Stuff ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:03:59.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
