The show will be held February 15 at 5 p.m. EST at Pier 59 Studios. \nThis comes after ‘Ye shared Yeezy Season 4 at last fall’s fashion extravaganza. That show received harsh criticism before it even occurred as Kanye held a casting call for “multiracial women.” The actual event was dubbed a disaster because it was held at a former smallpox hospital and the models were forced to sit down through intense heat. \nThe other shows have been eventful for other reasons as Yeezy Season 3 featured the debut of The Life of Pablo album at Madison Square Garden. \nAlthough details of the new collection have yet to be revealed, Yeezy posted several photos of clothing and accessories to his Instagram right around the time he canceled the remainder of his Saint Pablo Tour due to exhaustion. \nVogue speculates that Yeezy Season 5 will most likely feature city apparel, inspired by 1990s suburbia.
