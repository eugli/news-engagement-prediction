Beer names look to incorporate Bold Missy’s from music, movies, history or politics. \nBut don’t expect the brewery to take itself too seriously. Expect a light-hearted and fun atmosphere, she adds. \n“We take our beer seriously. We love woman. We love everybody,” says Lybbi Roth , taproom manager. \nAdds Waggener: “It’ll be a fun destination.” \nBold Missy Brewery hopes to begin pouring those brews sometime in April. \nConstruction continues on that 8,600-square-foot brewery located at 610 Anderson St. in the Charlotte neighborhood known as NoDa. That spot — formerly a cabinet shop— is located near a light-rail stop going into service in August. \nIt will be Charlotte’s first brewery owned solely by a female. \n“Charlotte in general is still really underrepresented in craft beer. I think there’s a lot of room for different perspectives,” Waggener says. \nThe brewery builds upon Waggener’s love of beer and makes a dream three-plus years in the making a reality. Its name ties to her longtime nickname — Bold Missy. \n“It’s very humbling,” she adds. \nBold Missy will operate a 15-barrel brewhouse. \nDan Baker has signed on as brewmaster. That role will allow Baker to put a modern twist on traditional styles.
