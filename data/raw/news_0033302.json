Very often people are too rough but she had it exactly right,‚Äù Salter tells PEOPLE. ‚ÄúThe controls are extremely sensitive, and she was extremely sensitive.‚Äù \nKate told him she hadn‚Äôt flown before ‚Äúbut she wanted to understand what the feeling was like in the air. She now realizes how the controls alter the sensation in the air. She was a natural.‚Äù \nShe took the place of Flight Sergeant Jordan Avery, 18, who was in the seat ahead of her. He says, ‚ÄúHer flying was very good ‚Äî probably the same standard as I am, and I‚Äôve been on the course for a day.‚Äù \n\nKate, who took over from Prince Philip as Honorary Air Commandant of the Air Cadets in December 2015, was introduced to the recruits of the Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Wing Air Training Corps, who are on the camp at RAF Wittering this week.

It provides training and encourages the development of life skills including leadership and teamwork. There are 41,000 cadets ages 12-19 and 15,000 adult volunteers in the U.K. and abroad.

They spent the first few years of married life in North Wales, where the prince was a helicopter search and rescue pilot with the RAF. More recently, he has been flying on behalf of the East Anglian Air Ambulance ‚Äì a post William is set to give up soon as he concentrates on royal duties.
