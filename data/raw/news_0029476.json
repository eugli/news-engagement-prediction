The slow-burning country-soul cut first appeared on Morris' debut album, Hero , last year. Related Grammys 2017: The Complete Winners List Breakout star on playing 'SNL,' being influenced by Hanson and why she's not afraid to sing about her flings \nMorris and Keys performed against a domestic backdrop: large candle-stands, glowing chandeliers and tall, arched windows. After Morris sang the first verse of \"Once,\" Keys sauntered onstage to deliver the second, and the two artists exploded together during the song's histrionic final verse. The string section shivered and swelled, helping to articulate the ballad's natural rise and fall. \nMorris and Keys have performed together before: In December, they teamed up for an episode of CMT Crossroads , which pairs a country performer with an artist from another genre. \"We are both up for any challenge,\" Keys told Rolling Stone at the time. \"Maren does her style and I do my style and they blend so well together. \n\"You don't hear a note and think, 'That's a rock note and I like it because it's a rock note,'\" Keys added. \"You don't care what note it is, you just want to feel it and feel great.\" \nKeys is not up for any awards this year; her last album, Here , came out after the deadline for Grammy submissions in 2016. Morris is nominated for awards in several country categories; she already took home the Best Country Solo Performance trophy for \"My Church.\" More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:13:41.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
