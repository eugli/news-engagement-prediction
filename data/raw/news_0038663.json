Every time Arjen Robben cut inside on his left foot, Arsenal backed away. \nIt was on the second such occasion that the damage was done – the former Chelsea player’s shot curled into the top corner in the 11th minute. EPA Arjen Robben scored the opener early on REUTERS Alexis Sanchez's initial penalty was saved \nEven then there was a sense it could be the first of many. Somehow, though, the two teams got to the break level. \nSanchez had been lucky to be awarded a foul on a rare break and Manuel Neuer spilled Mesut Ozil’s free-kick shot in a rare show of nerves. \nHowever, when the Chile international stood by the spot minutes later after referee Milorad Mazic awarded a foul after Robert Lewandowski, attempting to clear, clumsily fouled Laurent Koscielny, the Germany goalkeeper looked immense stood on the line. \nSure enough, Neuer stopped a relatively poor penalty kick. But at that moment Sanchez’s tenacity really kicked in. \nHe may have miscued his follow-up effort, but when the ball came to him yet again, eight yards from goal he made no mistake, drilling it in through a forest of legs. \nArsenal could even have taken an outrageously flattering lead into the interval when Granit Xhaka forced Neuer to save or when Ozil burst through only to fluff his shot. REUTERS Lewandowski's towering header put Bayern back ahead REUTERS Bayern scored three in 10 minutes to pull away from Arsenal \nThat said, two wayward headers from the unmarked Lewandowski that went over the bar would have been a better focus for the away dressing room at half-time. At least it was more of a contest. \nWell, it was for three minutes of the second half when Koscielny limped off to be replaced by Gabriel. That meant that Shkodran Mustafi was marking Lewandowski when the ball was swung in by Philipp Lahm after 53 minutes and he was easily outjumped by a striker who had suddenly rediscovered his eye for goal. \nThen the simplest of flicks from the Poland striker wrong-footed Gabriel all too easily and Thiago stole in to make it three. It could have been four when David Ospina rushed needlessly from his goal, a combination of head and crossbar saving them. \nBut a clearance up in the air from the corner, a weak header straight to Thiago on the edge of the area and a couple of deflections later Arsenal were 4-1 down. This was becoming embarrassing. \nIn the end it took the addition of sub Thomas Muller to add the fifth, waltzing through what was left of the Arsenal defence. It was a disgraceful goal for them to concede and one which left Sanchez crouching disbelieving of his team-mates on the touchline. \nRemember it is not only Wenger’s future currently hanging in the balance. \nBAYERN MUNICH (4-2-3-1) : Neuer; Lahm, Hummels, Martinez, Alaba; Alonso, Vidal; Robben (Rafinha 88), Thiago, Costa (Kimmich 84); Lewandowski (Muller 86).
