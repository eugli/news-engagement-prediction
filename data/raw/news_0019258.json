As well as being fit, strong and healthy. Nothing to do with luck.\n\"Legendary effort from a legendary man.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.9news.com.au/national/2017/02/08/15/00/man-trapped-for-hours-with-just-his-head-above-water-in-nsw-dam", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/008F/production/_94234100_tractor.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4EAF/production/_94234102_tractor2.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-09T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:38:39.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
