The Prime Minister also plans to stop rich developers sitting on land and wants to redevelop inner-city areas as part of the biggest housing revolution since the 1960s More than 100,000 pre-packed 'modular' homes could be constructed as the Government looks at ways to meet its target to provide one million new homes by 2020. A Government white paper will include measures to encourage banks to lend to firms which construct the homes off-site before delivering them to their final destination. Ministers are planning a new wave of prefabricated homes in a drive to solve Britain's housing crisis. Pictured, a general view of the ZEDpod model The pre-made homes can be built off-side in as little as a day and take just 48 hours to install on-site. The initiative recalls the reconstruction drive which followed the Second World War as ready-made homes - dubbed 'prefabs' - sprung up across the country as the government sought to house families bombed out of their homes by the Germans. While the prefab nickname of the 1940s homes was often a byword for poor quality, improvements in technology mean that such concerns are no longer an issue. Developers are asking the Government to urgently review the amount of Green Belt land that is protected from home building. Legal & General, the financial services company which is also one of the country’s biggest housebuilders, called for a ‘critical reassessment’ of the Green Belt. Its chief executive, Nigel Wilson, said one million new homes could be built if only 1 per cent of Green Belt land was released. ‘The Green Belt has doubled in size in the last 20 years, it is four million acres now,’ Mr Wilson told the BBC. ‘We’ve got to have a much greater critical assessment on what is and what isn’t Green Belt. ‘Nobody wants to build on the Chilterns, or the Malverns or the beautiful parts of Britain, but there are lots of areas that have been designated Green Belt which are really brownfield sites and we absolutely have to build on more brownfield sites.’ Pre-fab houses sprung up across the country post World War Two, such as this one here pictured in Watford, as a demand for housing grew Separately, the L&Q housing association said Britain faced a choice: build on green fields or continue with a shortage. A centre-Right think-tank has echoed the demands for a radical review of the Green Belt. The Centre for Policy Studies said only 200 homes were built on public land between 2011 and 2015 but that nearly 110,000 should have been put on the same parcels of land. The Government is unveiling a White Paper on housing stock next week, after Theresa May vowed to tackle the chronic shortage and soaring prices. Ahead of its release, the think-tank published its own report, urging ministers to make dramatic reforms. Authors Keith Boyfield and Daniel Greenberg said: ‘Without radical action, the Government will not achieve its target to build one million new homes by 2020.’ Voters considered housing to be one of the top five issues facing the country and ‘will not look kindly on a Government which fails to meet its housing targets’, they warned. ‘The economy already suffers as a result of inadequate housing stocks… high house prices distort the labour market, forcing working people to waste fruitless and uncomfortable hours commuting.’ House price growth got off to a steady start in 2017 but the outlook remains 'clouded', according to an index. Plea: Developers want to build on the Green Belt and Mrs May could agree in circumstances where all brownfield sites are used up Property values edged up by 0.2% month-on-month in January, following an 0.8% increase in December, Nationwide Building Society said. The annual pace of price growth also slowed, with a 4.3% rise in January, compared with 4.5% in December. The year-on-year increase was the slowest in 14 months. The average UK house price stood at £205,240 in January. Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, said annual price growth had remained 'broadly stable at the start of 2017'. But he said: 'The outlook for the housing market remains clouded, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding economic prospects more broadly. 'On the one hand, there are grounds for optimism. The economy has remained far stronger than expected in the wake of the Brexit vote. 'Recent data indicates that the economy didn't slow in the second half of 2016 and the unemployment rate remained stable at an 11-year low in the three months to November.'
