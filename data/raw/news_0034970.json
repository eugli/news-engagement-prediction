Unsolved illegal shootings contributed to the losses, and officials said that year also saw lower pup survival.\nLast year was different, according to winter ground and aerial surveys conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its partner wildlife agencies in the two states. Fifty wild-born pups survived the year, compared with just 23 in 2015.\nAt least 63 wolves roamed the forests of eastern Arizona as of January, the agencies reported.\nMORE: 14 endangered Mexican wolves found dead in 2016 \n\"We are encouraged by these numbers, but these 2016 results demonstrate we are still not out of the woods with this experimental population,\" U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Regional Director Benjamin Tuggle said in a news release.\nThe goal is a 10 percent average population gain, he said.\nFeds propose wolf releases near Arizona-New Mexico border\nThe year's positive numbers didn't sway wolf advocates, who say the population needs a major infusion of new blood with new releases of captive wolves.\n\"The key is ensuring genetic diversity because inbreeding is a very likely reason that growth is still anemic,\" said Michael Robinson, a conservation advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity. \"The key is getting more wolves in the wild.\"\nArizona has favored placing captive-born pups with wild packs in the state lately, instead of releasing pairs to form new packs. The tactic remains risky, Robinson said, as the annual census shows only three of six wolves fostered in this manner apparently survived last year.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Mexican gray wolves   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

It was hunted into near extinction with U.S. government help in the past century before a captive breeding program began with the last seven survivors in the 1970s.\nMexico also has re-established a small population.\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has long struggled to produce a recovery plan that would lay out a population goal and the means to get there, but it is due to release one this fall.\nMORE: El Jefe, Arizona's mighty jaguar, is missing in action", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:54:17.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
