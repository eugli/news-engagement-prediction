Rather, it is nationalism, which demands engagement but on ruthlessly competitive terms. This flows from an idea that the world’s natural state is of clashing civilizations, an idea popularized by the scholar Samuel P. Huntington. “Rule of law is going to exist when you talk about our sovereignty and you talk about immigration.” When Mr. Bannon cites sovereignty — in this case, to increase deportations — he conveys a need to assert control against a vaguely defined enemy. Breitbart and like-minded websites often describe sovereignty as rooted in the nationalist premise that any nation-state is built around a core cultural identity that it must protect. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The word “sovereignty,” Mr. Kreiss said, asserts “a defense of protecting an idea of what America is and should be.” He said the “symbolic core of the nation” is being defined as white and Christian and seeing itself as “under threat by cosmopolitanism and globalism.” “They’re corporatist, globalist media that are adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has.” In Mr. Bannon’s populist worldview, the United States’ traditional embrace of globalism is so clearly against American interests that it could only have been orchestrated by powerful elites. Those elites include, in his telling, the news media — “globalist” for embracing of trade and immigration, and “corporatist” for serving the business interests that are presumed to benefit at Americans’ expense. Mr. Bannon has called the news media the “opposition party,” characterizing it as innately hostile to the Trump administration and therefore deserving of neither trust nor transparency. Here, Mr. Bannon also portrays it as representing elites, and therefore in natural opposition to populist sites like Breitbart, which he has characterized as representing the people. This is reflected in President Trump’s assertions that the media is the “enemy of the American people.” “The center core of what we believe, that we’re a nation with an economy. Not an economy just in some global marketplace with open borders, but we are a nation with a culture and a reason for being.” Mr. Bannon is articulating a central idea of nationalists the world over: that the nation-state is the fundamental building block of humanity, with each nation defined by a fixed cultural identity. In this view, countries are in a natural state of permanent competition. Any international integration suborns the identity that is a nation’s most important asset. Immigration is also seen as threatening that identity. This helps explain why Mr. Bannon portrays “open borders” as a danger to America’s “culture” and “reason for being.” Of course, every nation’s identity and demographics change over time. But opposing those changes, Mr. Kreiss said, has proved powerful at mobilizing a community. “It’s a very defined cultural and ideological movement that’s giving voice to this and creating a framework for this,” he said. “It’s powerful for a lot of people.” A version of this article appears in print on February 25, 2017, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Bannon’s Vision for a ‘Deconstruction of the Administrative State’.
