After bringing Damon down a peg with some ponytail jokes, Kimmel turned to Trump, whom he thanked for making Hollywood look much better by comparison — “Remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?” Then, because no Oscars presentation is complete without Meryl jokes, Kimmel took on the country’s most “overrated” nominee . The host led the audience in a “totally undeserved round of applause” and then got in a jab over her recent spat with Karl Lagerfeld . “Nice dress, by the way,” he joked. “Is that an Ivanka?” As Kimmel predicted, Donald Trump will likely respond on Twitter during his 5 a.m. bowel movement tomorrow.\nTags: oscars 2017 jimmy kimmel donald trump meryl streep matt damon tv movies awards More Kimmel Ribs Trump, Streep, and Damon in Oscars Monologue Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories 2017 Oscar Winners: See the Full List People’s Court ’s Judge Joseph Wapner Dead at 97 Australian Author Recounts Terrifying Detainment by U.S. Immigration Officers Most Viewed Stories ‘Defamed’ Meryl Streep Slams Karl Lagerfeld Over Oscars Dress Controversy; Lagerfeld Issues Apology Bill Paxton Dead at 61 Neil Fingleton, Game of Thrones ’ Mag the Mighty, Dead at 36 Natalie Portman Skipping Oscars Due to Pregnancy Nocturnal Animals Has Two Endings, and Both of Them Are Killer What to Stream Now See what's new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBO Remy Ma Drops Nicki Minaj Diss Track; Minaj Responds Nick Kroll and John Mulaney’s Hilarious Spirit Awards Monologue Confirms They Should Be Hosting the Oscars Next Year Celebrities Grieve the Death of Bill Paxton College Champion Lives Your Wildest Intellectual Dreams by Writing Joke ‘Final Jeopardy’ Answer Vulture’s Final 2017 Oscar Predictions for Every Category Most Popular Video On Vulture Keanu Reeves Is Obsessed With Doing His Own Stunts Latest News from Vulture 1 min ago Casey Affleck’s Production Company Donated to Trump Without Affleck Knowing Affleck/Middleton Project donated $5,000 to Trump’s transition team.\n19 mins ago Jimmy Kimmel Goes After Trump, Streep, and, of Course, Damon in Oscars Monologue “Nice dress, by the way.
