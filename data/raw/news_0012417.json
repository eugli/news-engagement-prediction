Read More NEW DELHI: Uncapped Uttar Pradesh left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav has earned his maiden call-up to an Indian Test squad following news of Amit Mishra being ruled out of the one-off match against Bangladesh in Hyderabad this week. A BCCI release on Tuesday stated that legspinner Mishra was not available for the Bangladesh Test on account of a knee injury sustained during the third T20I against England last week, and that he requires further medical examination. Mishra played India's last Test, also against England, in December when Haryana team-mate Jayant Yadav was ruled out with injury. Kuldeep, 22, has taken 81 wickets in 22 first-class matches at an average of 18.94 apiece. He finished the recent Ranji Trophy with 35 wickets in eight matches, with a best of 6/79, apart from scoring 466 runs at 35.84 with one century and five half-centuries. This earned him a place in the Rest of India team that won the Irani Cup over Ranji winners Gujarat, in which Kuldeep went wicketless. He has now been added to India's Test squad after a good showing for India A in the practice game versus Bangladesh, taking three wickets including those of Mahmudullah, Soumya Sarkar and Mominul Hague . The solitary Test match starts on Thursday in Hyderabad. This is the first Test visit by Bangladesh to India.
