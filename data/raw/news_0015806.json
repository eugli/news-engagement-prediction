How and for what purpose are you going to use the bike? Are you planning on using it for day-to-day commuting? Do you want to get away for the weekend and tour from state to state? Are you passionate and do you idolize Valentino Rossi or Marc Marquez and want to drop a knee on a racetrack or zoom around your local canyon road? Did you get the travel bug after watching Long Way Round and now want to ride around the globe? These questions should serve as your ultimate barometer because there are many bikes out there designed to suit a particular riding style and function. 2. How much bike can you honestly handle? While you're still learning to operate a motorcycle well , it's important to not be hindered by a bike that is too big, too heavy, or too powerful. Knowing what you can manage not just physically, but mentally, is very important. Ensuring you can place both feet firmly on the ground and reach the controls is a good start, but also think about how good your hand-eye coordination is. If you buy a bike that is powerful and fast, do you have the discipline to refrain from doing stupid, stupid things with that power? 3. How much money do you really want to spend on your first bike? \"Dropping\" a motorcycle when you are new to riding is a reality. Damage to a bike means having to fix it, which costs money, and smaller, less expensive bikes are easier and cheaper to fix compared to their larger counterparts. Also, larger engines typically mean higher insurance payments for the first three years you have your license. 4. Do you love it? The last, but in many ways, most important factor to consider, is this: When you look at the bike you have chosen, does it speak to you? Does it motivate you to get out and ride and experience the world around you? When you walk up to the bike, or walk away from it after a ride, do you have a hard time looking away? Do you think to yourself, \"Damn, that's one beautiful and amazing motorcycle, and whoever gets to ride it is one lucky SOB?\" If so, you've chosen well, my friend. Courtesy of Ducati What they are: A lot of manufacturers are throwing around the term \"scrambler\" now, because it's \"hip\" and \"cool.\" A true scrambler gets its name from relatively small dirt bikes built for racing on off-road courses with low jumps. Scramblers today are more of a throwback to those bikes, identifiable by their high tailpipe, semi-knobby or knobby tires, slightly longer travel suspension than a road bike, and wide-set tracker bars. You should consider one if: You want to channel your inner Steve McQueen, but only on weekends. Scramblers do a good job at bridging the gap between working well on paved roads and dirt roads, but don't expect to become an off-road god(dess) on one. Courtesy of Triumph 2017 Triumph Street Scrambler Price: $10,700 The new-for-2017 Street Scrambler is a beautiful both inside and out. It combines the aesthetics of old scrambler-style motorcycles from the '50s-'70s with new modern technologies like traction control, ABS, throttle-by-wire, and efficient fueling. Simply put, it's all of the great looks without the ride-ability and reliability downsides that you have to overcome on an original. Courtesy of Ducati Ducati Desert Sled Price: $11,395 When Ducati made its Scrambler line a couple years ago, everyone begged for the legendary Italian company to make a truly off-road-capable machine. The new Desert Sled is as beautiful as it is capable, refined, and hungry for dirt. Ducati engineers were sure to include beefed-up components nearly everywhere -- all crucial steps to ensuring off-road durability. Courtesy of BMW What they are: Adventure motorcycles are essentially your go-anywhere, do-(almost)-anything bikes. They're capable of eating up highway miles, tackling off-road sections, daily commuting, or carrying tons of gear. Most of the best bikes in this category have tall seat heights, so they're not very accommodating to beginner riders who are vertically challenged. The dominant bikes here are the BMW R1200 GS (shown above) and the KTM 1290 Super Adventure , but you can save yourself some cash by springing for an excellent alternative. You should consider one if: You're relatively tall and want a good all-around bike that you can take to work or school every day. Courtesy of Honda Honda Africa Twin Price: $12,999 The Honda Africa Twin is a long-awaited adventure motorcycle that comes with a traditional manual transmission and Honda's automatic dual-clutch transmission. Think about that for a second: It's a motorcycle with an automatic transmission. It is more than capable of going anywhere and doing anything -- and of being ridden by virtually anyone. Courtesy of Kawasaki Kawasaki Versys-X 300 Price: $5,399 Kawasaki recently jumped into the small adventure bike market with the Versys-X 300. It's a good choice for anyone looking for a fun, nimble bike that's pretty much good at everything. Spring for the optional ABS (think of it as $300 well spent), and the Versys will make for a great everyday commuter and serve to tackle the dirt roads on longer travels once the pavement ends. Courtesy of Kawasaki What they are: They're the supercars of the two-wheeled world. The thrill of speed combines with aggressive lean angles to provide an adrenaline rush that can rarely be matched. It's imperative on sport bikes to be ultra-smooth in the application of throttle, clutch, and brakes, so for beginners, powerful sport bikes can often result in expensive medical bills, not to mention a broken bike. Smaller sport bikes, meanwhile, allow for just as much fun and can be ultimately forgiving when riders make mistakes. You should consider one if: You love the idea of riding fast, can check your ego at the door, and deep down, you know the 1980s peaked with the Top Gun chase scene . Courtesy of Yamaha Yamaha YZF-R3 Price: $4,999 The little Yamaha R3 is the perfect beginner sport bike. The twin-cylinder, 321cc engine performs well at highway speeds, and overall, the bike is nimble and powerful enough to raise your heartbeat when the roads get twisty. As with the Kawasaki above, think of the ABS system as a $300 investment in not scratching the beautiful matte (black or white) bodywork. Courtesy of Triumph Triumph Street Triple Price: $9,400 If you can handle a bigger bike and you possess the self-discipline to handle extra power, the Triumph Street Triple is one of the best. It won't break a sweat at the track or on canyon roads, and it's docile enough to handle everyday use. The upright riding position is less aggressive than a traditional sport bike, which makes it particularly well suited to longer stints in the saddle. related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:36:35.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
