Ad Feedback \n\"She said she did not know what to do because his dog had been crying all night in the cold,\" Barlow said. \n\"She had taken a blanket to its kennel and she was worried the dog would freeze in the nights ahead.\" \nShe was simply passing on a message, she said. \n\"I don't agree with the way we have followed the process in this instance - we should have had a surrender form signed - and we need to learn a lesson from that.\" \nWelsh's lawyer, Jay Lovely, released a statement on behalf of Welsh and the council on Friday. \nIt includes an acknowledgment from the council that it made a mistake in shooting Jake. \n\"The council acknowledges that an error was made when Mr Welsh's dog Jake was destroyed. \n\"A number of factors contributed to that error. The error is regretted. It also caused distress to Mr Welsh.\" \nNo one person was at fault, according to the statement. \n\"The council has reviewed its procedures and would like to commit to giving people as much time as is practical in the decision as to whether a dog will be destroyed. \n\"Council and its employees take its obligations and duties seriously, and want to perform those to the highest standard.\" \nThe council had apologised to Welsh, and would pay him an agreed amount in compensation. \nThe settlement follows a year in which the council's legal costs reached $375,000. \nOf the money spent by the council on legal fees in 2016, $160,000 was a result of district plan changes and plan reviews. \nLand sales and leases resulted in a $134,000 bill, while other regulatory matters cost the council $21,000. \nThe remaining $60,000 was a result of \"other legal matters\". - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:31:46.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
