Jones , USA TODAY Sports 1:36 a.m. ET Feb. 6, 2017 CLOSE x Share USA TODAY Sports' Lindsay Jones breaks down how the Patriots managed to pull off a comeback for the ages in Super Bowl LI. USA TODAY Sports Atlanta Falcons' Alex Mack hikes the ball to Matt Ryan during the first half of the NFL Super Bowl 51 football game against the New England Patriots Sunday, Feb. 5, 2017, in Houston. (Photo: Matt Slocum, AP) \nHOUSTON – Alex Mack got the bad news first, almost immediately after the Atlanta Falcons won the NFC Championship Game two weeks ago. \nHe had suffered a chip in his fibula in his lower left leg, just above the ankle. \nThen came the good news. Mack would be able to play in his first Super Bowl, but he was going to have to do so while in a lot of pain. \nMORE COVERAGE: Tom Brady suspects Super Bowl jersey was stolen after game \nMack wore extra protective padding on his lower left leg in Sunday’s Super Bowl LI and he did not miss a snap in the Falcons’ 34-28 loss to the New England Patriots. He said after the game the injury was painful, and it was still unclear whether he would need surgery to repair it. \nMostly, what Mack felt Sunday night was mental anguish. \n“Depressed,” Mack said, when asked to describe how he was feeling physically. \nMack missed a block on Patriots defensive lineman Trey Flowers late in the fourth quarter, part of a sequence of negative plays that pushed Atlanta out of field goal range. \n“It hurts. It hurts your team,” Mack said. “You definitely want to stay in field goal range. Three points at a time like that means a lot, and that’s why it stings a lot.” \nFollow Lindsay H.
