Germantown Road. Bailey said he views Germantown as an underserved breakfast market, calling it the perfect location for his concept. He's confident the new location's sales will top its predecessor's, as it will be about 3,500 square feet — or about 1,000 square feet bigger than the original. The East Memphis location opened in 2015, but Bailey said it was always his plan to grow the concept quickly. With the Thornwood location slated to be open by the end of the year, Bailey said he's already scouting possibilities for a third location. \"There are some surrounding cities that are obviously very interesting to me. ... I'm heading to Oxford in a couple weeks to look around,\" said Bailey, who is a University of Mississippi alumnus. Jacob Steimer covers CRE, manufacturing, finance and nonprofits for MBJ.
