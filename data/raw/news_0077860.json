The more likely people were to experience other cultures — through travel or food — the more likely they were to vote for Mr. Obama, even controlling for things like income, education, personality, racial attitudes and city living. As J.D. Vance recalls in his memoir, “ Hillbilly Elegy ,” comments about voters in parts of the country “clinging to their guns and their religion” didn’t help Appalachian residents warm to Mr. Obama. He was different from them, and he reminded them of it all the time. As the 2016 campaign unfolded, Donald J. Trump drew on this tendency to mistrust those who are different by saying he would keep various outsiders away. To see whether this had appeal, I asked 3,000 people the cosmopolitanism questions and found a pattern. White Republican primary voters were more likely to vote for one of the other 16 candidates in the race instead of Mr. Trump if they had traveled abroad or gone to an Indian or Japanese restaurant in the last 10 years. In some cases, the differences were quite large. Mr. Trump fared worst among white G.O.P. primary voters who had been to Asia, Africa or South America. These voters were 23 points more likely to choose one of the other candidates in the race. Those who had been to Europe, Australia, Canada or Mexico or had eaten at an Indian restaurant were also less likely to choose Mr. Trump by 10 to 12 points. The differences for eating at a Japanese restaurant and hunting were smaller, and there were no differences among those who had played softball on a team. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In the general election, there were also wide divergences among white voters. People who had been hunting in the last decade favored Mr. Trump by 22 points, while those had played softball favored him by nine points. People who had eaten Indian food favored Mrs. Clinton by 15 points, and those who had been to Europe or Australia favored her by 13 points. These relationships persist after accounting for things like partisanship, income, education and geography.

Credit Nathan Weber for The New York Times Who we are and how we see ourselves in the world — fundamental questions about our identity — relate to our political choices. This is nothing new. A willingness to come into contact with others may drive both travel and vote choice, but actually experiencing differences has been shown to have effects on behavior . \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah confronted this identity question head-on in his 2007 book “ Cosmopolitanism ” by asking readers to entertain the idea that in an increasingly connected world we have obligations that stretch “beyond those to whom we are related by the ties of kith and kind.” Some of these people may be different in one way or another, but Mr. Appiah urged us to consider the possibility that these differences are worth exploring because they help us learn about one another and thus make it easier to live together and respect one another. He’s not alone. In “ Hillbilly Elegy ,” Mr. Vance writes about the views his family passed on to him about those who were different. According to his Mamaw, that is, his grandmother, people who were outsiders, whether socially or culturally, could never understand the needs, hopes or experiences of Mr. Vance’s kin. The Appalachian natives in Mr. Vance’s memoir were not interested in the kind of exploration of differences that Mr. Appiah envisions. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
