I seat under the mango tree. \n“If my students or anybody wants to see me, he must either meet me in the class or strategically position himself and wait for me to pass by. \n“This is just to tell you how bad the situation is. It is affecting our motivation and making it difficult to impact,’’ Ibrahim disclosed. \nHe said that Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund ) had not been fair to polytechnics in terms of intervention for infrastructural development. \n“If TETFund gives university N200 million, for example, it will give polytechnic N50 million for infrastructure. \n“ Nigeria is a developing economy and needs the middle class of manpower to develop the economy. \n“The essence of polytechnic education is to bring out middle class operations in terms of technological advancement, design implementation and even research. \n“The lack of infrastructure in the system is hampering the ability of the middle class to deliver, ‘’ he said. \nThe ASUP Chairman called on the Federal Government to address infrastructure challenges affecting polytechnic education in the country.
