You need to go out on a Saturday night & see what a police officer has to deal with.' Paul, a frontline officer from Doncaster, wrote: 'Really, how many times have you been spat at in the house of commons? I have lost count in custody. No idea.' A dog handler for Avon and Somerset Police tweeted: 'Not necessary!!! I'll just continue to get spat at then!!! Ridiculous deluded statement.' Traffic officer Shona Gillen wrote: '@HackneyAbbott u can meet me as well. I got bitten by someone with HIV & hepC and spat in face. Is there another solution??' Sergeant Sean Underwood, of Avon and Somerset Police, tweeted: 'Get my blood results tomorrow after spat at twice, in face by someone with more diseases than I can name! Jo Brooke-Williams wrote: 'Of course not Diane, that's why I had to put my life on hold for six months whilst I waited for test results to come back.' A Norfolk Police officer said: 'thanks 4 support, every day 4 the last 16yrs I've put others 1st in the face of adversity, been assaulted and spat at!!' An anonymous firearms officer added: 'Again, so out of touch with reality. Thankfully, there's no chance of you becoming Home Secretary any time soon.' In July 2016, Ukrainian police officer Arina Koltsova died after a suspect with tuberculosis spat in her face Prolific tweeter Ms Abbott kept silent even when challenged by a woman claiming to be the widow of a police officer who died from hepatitis C after being spat on. She also ignored a tweet from Policing and Fire Service Minister Brandon Lewis asking: 'Have you spoken to officers who have suffered from being spat at?' Acting Inspector Steve Chalcraft, of Sussex Police, tweeted the Labour MP: 'Spit hoods protect many officers from disgusting & dangerous assaults. They also negate the need to use force on the head.' Simon Newport, chairman of the North Wales Police Federation, wrote: 'When you have something useful or appropriate to say I may listen. What utter rubbish you speak.' Tony Green, secretary of the Humberside Police UNISON branch, added: 'Disappointing and ridiculous comment. You should be speaking out against assaults on our police staff members.' Staffordshire Police Superintendent Elliott Sharrard-Williams urged her to reply, tweeting: 'Mrs Abbott, will you be responding to any of the concerns raised regarding your comments?' But she ignored the criticism and instead spent the time re-tweeting Labour press releases and links to her blog posts. The outspoken Corbynite - who has more than 131,000 followers - failed to respond to a single tweet despite being bombarded with messages for two days The latest controversy comes after the pro-European MP was accused of 'pulling a sickie' and missing a crunch vote on the Government's Brexit bill. Ms Abbott was mocked for coming down with a migraine just before the ballot - having been debating in Westminster just hours earlier - leading to claims she 'bottled it'. Despite calls for her to step down, she joined colleagues for the final Commons ballot on Wednesday and voted to trigger Article 50. POLICE OFFICER WHO DIED AFTER SHE WAS SPAT AT In July 2016, Ukrainian police officer Arina Koltsova died after a suspect with tuberculosis spat in her face. The 35-year-old collapsed on the job and was later diagnosed with the deadly lung disease. Paying tribute at the time, a friend said: 'Arina wanted to change something for our country. Joining the police was a conscious choice, she wanted to change things for the better.' Her police department said: 'This is an irreplaceable loss for the whole of Kiev police. Fond memories of Arina will remain in our hearts forever.' She then reportedly told Brexit Secretary David Davis to 'f*** off' when he tried to kiss her in the Commons bar after the vote. Last year it was revealed that 17 of the UK's 49 police forces used spit hoods, with four more considering their introduction. Martha Spurrier, director of Liberty, has previously spoken out against the equipment, saying: 'A spit hood is a primitive, cruel and degrading tool that inspires fear and anguish. 'We have seen many cases where the police use them unnecessarily and without justification, including on children and disabled people.' Lawyers have also raised fears that officers might not be able to see whether suspects are breathing if their face is covered. Defending the latest roll-out, Assistant Chief Constable David Hardcastle said the hoods were needed to protect staff from 'unacceptable and potentially dangerous behaviour'. He said: 'Our officers put themselves at risk every day to protect the public and we want to ensure that they have the appropriate equipment to deal with the challenges they face. 'Everybody should be able to go to work without the possibility of being assaulted, including being spat at.'
