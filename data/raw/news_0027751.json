Pic/Datta Kumbhar \nThe Australian cricket team landed in India yesterday for their four-Test series against a rampaging Virat Kohli & Co, who are tipped to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\nBut their arrival at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport turned unusual when the Australian cricketers were seen loading their luggage themselves on a tempo. Usually, baggage handlers ensure the kit bags are transported to a vehicle or in the baggage storage area of the team bus, but this was extraordinary.\nAustralia kick off their tour with a three-day game against India A at the Brabourne Stadium on Thursday. The Aussies lost 0-4 when they last toured India in 2012-13.He felt India failed to wrap up the game quickly.\n\"The only thing I feel we could have done was close the second innings quicker. There were lapses in the field when they were eight down. Had we taken our chances, we probably could have finished the game earlier. \"Those are the things we can take away from this game and improve on. Closing the game is very crucial. You donâ€™t want to give the opposition any chance to get back,\" he concluded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:59:12.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
