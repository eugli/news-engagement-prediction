I have a lot of other things to do also,\" he said. \nTunku Ismail is also the owner of Johor Darul Taâ€™zim (JDT) club. \nKhairy was speaking to reporters after witnessing the signing ceremony of a memorandum of understanding between the ministry and Johor Petroleum Development Corporation Bhd (JPDC) in Putrajaya today. \nHowever, he said, he would still meet with FAM secretary-general Hamidin Mohd Amin despite having a tight schedule. \n\"I will see him at some point today. My day is quite full today,\" he said. \nPrevious reports have quoted Hamidin as saying that all parties should wait until today to know the final list of candidates for the post of FAM president which will be tabled to the exco on Feb 20. \nNext month, FAM is expected to hold the elections for its committee for the 2017-2012 term, including for the post of president which is now held by Tengku Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah. \nTo date, only former FAM deputy president Annuar Musa has confirmed he would contest the president's post. \nCommenting on the commotion at the Penang Batu Kawan Stadium last Saturday, Khairy said such incidents were among issues which should be tackled by the new FAM leadership. \nThe incident was allegedly triggered after fans of the Black Kumbang squad created a commotion after the match which saw Penang lose 0-1 to Sarawak in the Super League match. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:57:43.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
