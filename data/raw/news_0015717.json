Who is Cory Bernardi? \nThe 47-year-old South Australian was first elected to the Senate in 2006 after becoming the youngest ever Liberal Party state president aged 29. \nThe son of an Italian immigrant father and fourth-generation Australian mother, Mr Bernardi was a stockbroker, financial adviser and elite rower before entering politics. \nBacked by powerbrokers on the Liberal Party's right, Mr Bernardi was appointed a shadow parliamentary secretary, but resigned in 2012 after making controversial comments linking same-sex marriage to bestiality . \nHe has maintained a high profile from the backbench, making regular forays into public debate. \nMr Bernardi has his own website, blog, podcast, and is the self-published author of seven books - including two children's books. What does he believe? \nIn an email to supporters in March 2016, Senator Bernardi said his mission was to build a movement \"to fight against the tyranny of political correctness\". \n\"Unless the mainstream parties connect with the 'forgotten people' they will choose a different path,\" Mr Bernardi wrote. \n\"It's a global phenomenon and would be foolish to think it won't emerge in Australia.\" Image copyright Facebook Image caption Mr Bernardi has said he was inspired by political movements overseas \nA company controlled by Mr Bernardi's wife, Sinead, trademarked the name Australian Conservatives last year. \nMr Bernardi has pointed to Brexit and the rise of far-right politics in Europe as evidence of the public losing faith in major parties. \nAfter spending time in New York observing Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Mr Bernardi wrote he had learned \"what needs to be done\". \n\"My time in the United States has been invaluable not only in identifying some of the common problems evident in global politics but also formulating solutions,\" he wrote. \nAmong his views that have attracted controversy, Mr Bernardi has been critical of abortion and questioned whether climate change was caused by human activity. \n\"We will be united by the desire to create stronger families, to foster free enterprise, to limit the size and scope and reach of government while seeking to rebuild civil society,\" he said on Tuesday. \n\"We will give hope to those who despair at the current state of Australian politics and who demand a better way for themselves, for their children and for the nation.\" How have his old colleagues reacted? \nSenior Liberal Party figures have been increasingly strong in their attacks on Mr Bernardi since reports he would defect emerged on Monday. \n\"The Liberal Party's values are not limited to conservatism. We are Liberals because we are open to new ideas; tolerant of difference,\" tweeted Defence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne. \nTrade Minister Steve Ciobo said: \"With one or two exceptions he's never laid a glove on the Labor Party. Every time he's been in the headlines it's been about criticism of his own parties.\" \nImmigration Minister Peter Dutton said voters would be \"angry about the betrayal of the Liberal Party values\". \nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten said: \"A government which can't govern itself, can't govern the nation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:54:59.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
