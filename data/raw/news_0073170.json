No one will pay power, water bills and instalment of loans that they owe to the government,\" Malik said while speaking to media. \nHe said Jats from Delhi and Uttar Pradesh will protest in the national capital on March 2 and submit a memorandum on the quota issue to the President. They also plan to gherao Parliament, the date for which will be announced on March 2. \nMalik said a large number of Jats supported by many other people held peaceful demonstrations at Balla village in Karnal district, Mayyar in Hisar, Jassai in Rohtak, Raswala Chowk in Jhajjar, Ikkas in Jind, Jainpur Jattan in Kurukshetra, Deban in Kaithal and Anaj Mandi in Yamuna Nagar. \nBesides seeking quota in education and government jobs under Other Backward Classes category, the demands of the Jats include release of those jailed during last year's agitation, withdrawal of cases slapped during the protest and government jobs for the kin of those killed and injured while taking part in the stir. \nMeanwhile, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Ram Niwas said tonight that a four-member state-level committee comprising ADGP (Law and Order), Additional Advocate General and two representatives of the agitators had been constituted for redressal of grievances of the Jats. \nHe directed the SPs to resolve the grievances raised by the agitators, and urged the Jat leaders to meet the SP concerned along with evidence, if any. \nAction would be taken against those found guilty, irrespective of caste and investigation in such cases would be carried out within 24 hours, he said, adding the Director General of Police has also directed the SPs in this regard. \nRam Niwas said everyone in a democracy has the right to express his opinion in a peaceful manner but any attempt to disturb the law-and-order situation in the state would not be tolerated. \nHe ordered all Deputy Commissioners and SPs to deploy adequate police personnel at vulnerable points in view of the Jat agitation and ensure that normal life is not disrupted and all essential services continue uninterrupted in the state. \nDuty Magistrates should be deployed at all places and videography carried out to ensure that peace is not disturbed, Ram Niwas ordered while addressing DCs, Commissioners of Police and SPs through video-conferencing today. \nPlanning has been done to divert traffic wherever required and adequate paramilitary forces are available in the state, he added. \nTo maintain law and order, Sonipat District Magistrate K Makarand Pandurang issued orders to impose ban on all internet services under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code for 24 hours with effect from 5 pm today till 5 pm tomorrow. \nThe District Magistrate said the ban had been imposed to prevent people from misusing these services to spread wrong information and rumours. He said all telecom service providers have been directed to strictly abide by these orders. \nAs many as 30 people were killed and property worth crores of rupees was damaged at many places in Haryana during last year's Jat stir which had turned violent. \nRohtak and some of its neighbouring districts, including Sonipat and Jhajjar, were the worst hit by the violence.
