They just make them up when there are none.\" \nHe also said reporters \"shouldn't be allowed\" to use unnamed sources. \nAttacks on the press defined Trump's campaign and have been a theme of his first month in office. On Friday, it took the president roughly a minute to call out the \"dishonest media,\" after telling the attendees in the crowded ballroom to sit down. \n\"The dishonest media, they'll say, 'He didn't get a standing ovation,'\" Trump said. \"You know why?
