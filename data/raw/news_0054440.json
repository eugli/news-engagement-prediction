Photo: NBC On Monday night, seven children and teens fell through the ice and into a frigid pond in Central Park . Fortunately, help was nearby — in the form of two skateboarding models. (There goes my screenplay idea.)\nAccording to NBC New York , Bennett Jonas of California and Ethan Turnbull of Australia were skateboarding nearby the pond when they saw the kids fall in; Jonas immediately jumped in to pull them out and pass them over to Turnbull.\nBut these were no ordinary skateboarders – both Jonas and Turnbull are models signed with Soul Artist Management.\n“I was in this park for a reason tonight. I could’ve been anywhere right now but I was 100 yards away from kids who are drowning,” Bennett told reporters.\nHe and Turnbull then presumably ripped off their shirts and climbed a tree to rescue a kitten.", "external_links": ["http://www.soulartistmanagement.com/models/gentlemen/new-faces/1038488/bennett-jonas/book", "http://www.soulartistmanagement.com/models/gentlemen/new-faces/709537/ethan-turnbull/book", "http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Central-Park-Ice-Rescue-FDNY-414285463.html"], "published": "2017-02-21T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:35:21.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
