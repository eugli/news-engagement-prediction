The outspoken hedge-fund manager William A. Ackman has called student debt a big threat to the United States credit markets, saying, “I think that the government’s going to lose hundreds of millions of dollars.” JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, warned last year that student-debt defaults were a looming problem. More recently, some hedge funds — concerned about default rates and state and federal lawsuits accusing a major student-loan collector of abuses — have considered shorting shares of the company or its competitors in various ways. But it isn’t an easy trade to execute. For one thing, the relevant stocks are moving in the wrong direction. Shares of companies that deal with student loans , including Navient and SLM Corporation , otherwise known as Sallie Mae, have risen since early November, reflecting expectations that the Trump administration may establish a friendlier regulatory environment for student lenders. The student-loan market also benefits from having an implicit taxpayer backstop. Since the 2008 financial crisis, most loans are carried on the government’s balance sheet, and, because of wage-garnishment capabilities and other aggressive tools for collecting student debts, they are repaid at fairly high rates, making a rash of unpaid debts less likely. And there’s not a ready investment available that would allow one to bet against securities backed by student loans — no index like the one that hedge fund managers depicted in “The Big Short” used to bet against mortgages before the crisis. “There’s always been fervent interest about how to profit off the pain of the student-loan market,” said Rohit Chopra, who oversaw the industry as an assistant director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Now a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America, he has fielded many inquiries from investors looking for insight on how the market works. “For credit-focused hedge funds, they see a trillion-dollar asset class, but have struggled to engage in the same casinolike activities that they were able to on mortgage,” he said. Photo Taylor Mann, a researcher, has described the student-loan market as an “education bubble” that is backed by “toxic” loans. Credit Brandon Thibodeaux   One big hurdle for the would-be shorters is the lack of credit-default swaps , or C.D.S. — insurance policies that pay a holder when certain slices, or tranches, of a student-loan-backed security go bad. Such swaps were popular before the financial crisis and created fortunes when swaths of mortgage-backed bonds defaulted. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But people on Wall Street say a combination of banks’ worries about sullying their reputations by appearing to benefit from the financial struggles of students, the relatively small number of market participants who use complex shorting tools, and the expense of constructing such idiosyncratic trades has made firms reluctant to build the products that hedge funds want. “If I could have gone to Goldman Sachs ‘R’ Us and said, ‘I’ll take a short on this tranche, a short on that tranche,’ I would have done that, all day, every day,” said Taylor Mann, a researcher who has studied the student-loan market in granular detail, over a recent taco dinner in Athens, Tex., near where he lives. “The day I found out that, no, C.D.S. isn’t available, no, we don’t have any bespoke investment products,” he added, “it was like, ‘I’ve got to move on.’” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
