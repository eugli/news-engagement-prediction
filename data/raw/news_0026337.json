Share via Twitter Kevin Winter/Getty Images Bruno Mars lived up to his own lyrics at the 2017 Grammy Awards : \"If you say you want a good time, well, here I am baby.\" Bruno Mars' performance of \"That's What I Like\" was a good time for the audience, viewers, and Twitter alike. The superstar performer took the stage in an '80s-era leather track suit and, surprisingly, left a lot of his trademark theatrics (wild dance moves, crazy costume changes, pyrotechnics, and the like) at home. In its place was Mars' smooth-as-silk voice wooing us with his buttery, swoon-worthy lyrics and some catchy choreography. Of course, Mars knows his way around a Grammys stage; not only has he performed at the show before, he's also the proud owner of four Grammys of his own. And as always, Mars' 2017 performance packed a big, soulful punch, much to the delight of the at-home viewers and celebs watching him crush it live. Catch a glimpse below: Even Jennifer Lopez was feeling it. And Rihanna.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:17:04.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
