Or more accurately Friday night, which is when President Donald Trump suggested during his rally in Florida yesterday that something terribly terroristic had occurred.\n“Last night, we listened to Abba,” was one response coming from a country entirely unaware that it had been attacked.\nTrump made the seemingly off-the-cuff remark during his Florida rally, carried live on the news channels, while discussing the impact of refugees on violence overseas. “You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden,” he said. “Sweden. Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible.”\nThe comment prompted a Bowling Green Massacre of Twitter mocking, with tweeters taking up imaginary arms. Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt led the charge by asking “What has he been smoking?”\nOne of the more popular memes was a riff on IKEA’s famously simple – or at least international – how-to instructions:\nNaturally, Alec Baldwin couldn’t resist:\nI think Trump, w his ADD, asks about the latest terror event at same time that Kushner says, \"I like these meatballs. Where are they from?\"\n— ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) February 19, 2017\nNor could:\nThe other half will go to their graves always believing Sweden had their own 9/11 last Friday night – and nothing will change their minds. https://t.co/NZlsS4gNlh\n— Michael Moore (@MMFlint) February 19, 2017\nIn honor of the fallen, the President will watch Bergman's \"The Seventh Seal\". \"I didn't know they had seals in Sweden.

Today, we are listening to an angry yam. #lastnightinsweden\n— Last Night In Sweden (@LastNiteNSweden) February 19, 2017\nSo what did happen in Sweden? The likeliest explanation for Trump’s confusion is a Fox News Channel report that aired Friday during Tucker Carlson Tonight , which included an interview with filmmaker Ami Horowitz about immigration and violence in Sweden. In other words, “what happened last night in Sweden” is Trump-speak for “what I saw on Fox last night about Sweden.”\nOr maybe, Republican Senator Rand Paul has an explanation. On ABC’s This Week With George Stephanopoulos this morning, Paul said, “There was a New Year Eve altercation, I think, a year ago where there was quite a few things that were happening that did involve refugee populations. And I believe that was in Sweden.”\nRelated stories\nWGA Awards Ceremony Rips Donald Trump So Much, He (Sort Of) Makes An Appearance\nSen.
