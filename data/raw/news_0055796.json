'Savage' \nWalmsley, described as \"highly dangerous\", is one of four men serving life sentences for the \"vicious and savage\" stabbing of Anthony Duffy in 2014. \nMr Anderson said he was \"angry and incredibly shocked\" by the \"serious security breach\" and is waiting for a full briefing into what happened. \nA Ministry of Justice spokeswoman declined to comment on the specifics of the case. \n\"We are working closely with the police and are urgently investigating the matter,\" she said. \nDeputy General Secretary of the Prison Officer's Association (POA), Andy Darken, said it is \"fairly common\" for prisoners to be moved in taxis after a risk assessment is done to ensure this is safe. \n\"There's not a lot of difference if they are held up by armed gunmen in a secure van or a taxi\", he said.
