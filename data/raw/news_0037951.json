Credit Stephen Do \nThe Riverina area, particularly the towns of Albury and Griffith, has been hardest hit, but cases have also been identified in the Hunter-New England and suburbs around the Georges River, including Alfreds Point, Lugarno and Illawong. \nNSW Health Pathology senior scientist Stephen Doggett said heavy flooding in the early part of the season had given rise to a huge number of mosquitoes across the inland regions, and a substantial increase in Ross River Virus notifications had been noted from November. Advertisement \n\"We've seen a massive amount of mosquitoes - probably the highest we've ever seen,\" Mr Doggett said. \n\"Extraordinary numbers. And we've seen a massive increase in reports of Ross River Virus through the months of December and January. SHARE Senior Hospital Scientist at Westmead Hospital Stephen Doggett Photo: Wolter Peeters \n\"They were many, many times higher than our previous records and we've been doing this work since the late 80s. \n\"Now because we've had this hot dry weather mosquito numbers are dropping off and we're starting to see a bit of a decline in cases, but still last week there were 82 cases which is more than double the month's average in one week. It appears that the virus has exploded and now it's burnt itself out.\" SHARE Opposition health spokesman Walt Secord, left, with opposition leader Luke Foley. Photo: Jane Dyson \nOpposition health spokesman Walt Secord said the Health Minister Brad Hazzard should step up education campaigns to prevent mosquito-borne illnesses. \n\"NSW is in the grip of a serious Ross River Fever outbreak,\" Mr Secord said. \n\"It is a preventable illness and we want the state government to consider undertaking targeting spraying and other preventative measures.\" \nThe virus is mostly confined to the west of the Great Dividing Range where saltmarsh mosquitoes breed, but it has also been detected in today river areas such as the Georges River and Parramatta River. \nHowever, the disease is believed to be spread by mosquitoes that have bitten wallabies and kangaroos that carry the disease, so it is less prevalent in urban environments where there are fewer marsupial carriers. \nMr Doggett said he supported targeted spraying of mosquito larvae in areas where the disease was prevalent, but the cost of $5000 per treatment was prohibitive for regional councils. The total bill could climb to $30,000 for a season, he said. \n\"As a mosquito person I would say, yes, undertaking larval control would reduce the disease burden, but when you go to inland NSW you're talking about huge, huge hectares and huge cost and this is why it gets difficult.\" \nNSW Health advises people to protect themselves against infection by wearing long-sleeved clothes and insect repellent and using netting, mosquito coils and plug-in devices. \nMr Hazzard has been contacted for comment.
