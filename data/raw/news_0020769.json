Panneerselvam, 66, has accused Sasikala, a long-time confidante of Jayalalithaa, of keeping party leaders away from the former chief minister’s hospital bed and, after her death, engineering a coup to replace him. \nRead: Live updates on Tamil Nadu CM row \nThe people of Tamil Nadu deserved to be told the truth about her illness and death, he said. \nThe investigation into the death of Jayalalithaa will be headed by a retired high court judge. Jayalalithaa suffered a heart attack and passed away on December 5 after spending 75 days in hospital. \nSpeaking to journalists, Panneerselvam reiterated his willing to take back his resignation and said he would meet state governor C Vidyasagar Rao once he returned to Chennai. \nThe 66-year-old was speaking to the media as AIADMK MLAs were to meet to discuss the shock developments of the last 12 hours.

It were only the MLAs, who fear for their position, were siding with Sasikala, a senior leader supporting Panneerselvam told HT. \n“Sasikala is only a temporary general secretary of the party,” Panneerselvam said. \nAnother AIADMK leader KC Palanswamy, a former member of Parliament, said a movement would soon be launched to “retrieve” Poes Garden, AIADMK headquarters and Jaya TV. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:55:03.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
