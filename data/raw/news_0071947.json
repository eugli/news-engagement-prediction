Police in Sandusky, Ohio, arrested 26-year-old Brittany Fultz after a video recording revealed her performing a lap dance on the elderly patient, local CBS WTOL reports .\nThe video was recorded in December at The Commons of Providence in Sandusky, an assisted care facility.\nAnother nurse at the facility assisted Fultz in making the lap dance video but later turned the video over to her superiors. Both were fired from the nursing home and Fultz was charged with gross sexual imposition, a fourth-degree felony.\nThe Commons Executive Director, Staci Lehmkuhl released a statement on the incident:\nOn February 12, the Executive Director at the center learned of an incident involving a staff member making inappropriate comments and gestures to a resident. It was reported immediately to the local police department and Ohio Department of Health. The employee was placed on administrative leave and has since been terminated. We are cooperating with local police who are handling the investigation and we will not comment further about the ongoing investigation.\nPolice report that the video was never shared beyond the two suspects.\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com .\n Big Government , Law Enforcement , Pre-Viral , dementia , elderly care , felony sex charges , Sexual Abuse , The Commons of Providence", "external_links": ["http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fbig-government%2F2017%2F02%2F22%2Fnursing-home-workers-charged-sexually-exploiting-100-year-old-dementia-patient%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Nursing+Home+Workers+Charged+With+Sexually+Exploiting+100-Year-Old+Dementia+Patient", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fbig-government%2F2017%2F02%2F22%2Fnursing-home-workers-charged-sexually-exploiting-100-year-old-dementia-patient%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Nursing+Home+Workers+Charged+With+Sexually+Exploiting+100-Year-Old+Dementia+Patient&shortener=bitly", "https://twitter.com/warnerthuston", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fbig-government%2F2017%2F02%2F22%2Fnursing-home-workers-charged-sexually-exploiting-100-year-old-dementia-patient%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Nursing+Home+Workers+Charged+With+Sexually+Exploiting+100-Year-Old+Dementia+Patient", "http://www.wtol.com/story/34558065/woman-charged-with-sex-crime-against-100-year-old-dementia-patient"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:54:59.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
