Image caption Stacey speaks to a human rights lawyer who says \"it's clearly violating and abusing the children\". \nSpeaking to the camera after being held, she says: \"So I've just been kept by the police for the past two hours, they held us against our will, they would not let us go. \n\"Those grown men intimidated me, I'm nearly 30 years old, a strong woman,\" she goes on. \n\"So if they do have a relationship with these girls... They'd be very easy to manipulate. \n\"If they asked them to do something they didn't want to do, I don't know how confident they'd feel to say no.\" \nStacey Dooley investigates: Young Sex For Sale In Japan is available from Tuesday February 28 on BBC Three. \nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T15:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T10:17:43.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
