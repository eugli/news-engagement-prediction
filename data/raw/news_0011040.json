In the language of development, it is called cosmetic development,” said Shah. \nRead | ‘Acche din’ will come in UP when people dethrone Akhilesh Yadav as CM: Amit Shah \nHe said that the SP-Congress alliance was proof of Akhilesh accepting defeat before the elections. “If he had faith that SP can form government on its won, he would not have given 100 seats to the Congress,” he said. \nShah said, “…during our rule, Pakistan-backed terrorists launched an attack (in Uri) …Within 10 days, our Army went (across the LoC), hit the terrorists and came back. When surgical strikes happened, Rahul baba said that Modi ji, you do ‘khoon ki dalali’.The first thing we have done is given a PM who talks.” \nMaintaining that the safety of women was a primary concern, Shah said: “We have decided that in whichever area there is a college, an anti-Romeo squad will be there to teach SP goondas a lesson. If you want to save women from rapes by these SP goondas then there is only one way – formation of a BJP government.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:21:55.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
