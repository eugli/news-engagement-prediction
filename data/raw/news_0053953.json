He travels back to New York City from K’un L’un, only to find that his best friends are running his dad’s company—and they’re not happy to see him, either because they don’t believe he’s who he says he is, or because they just don’t want to hand over the company. Danny probably just needs a good lawyer to change his status from deceased to alive, but in the meantime, he’s got even bigger problems on his hands: Madame Gao, the Daredevil drug lord, makes her first appearance in this featurette. \nMadame Gao (Wai Ching Ho) warns Danny that New York City doesn’t need another hero, which is advice he probably won’t take to heart. But with the introduction of its presumed villain, and the demands that he put childish things away, Danny’s going to need some help. It’s a good thing that Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick) is already on hand, and eventually, the rest of the Defenders . But for now, Jones says Danny’s got a “fire inside” that will help him battle The Hand. \nIron Fist premieres March 17 on Netflix. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:01:17.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
