Compare with our MoneySupermarket-powered search Right now, 12 of the super sports cars are in the process of being created at the production facility - and that's it working totally flat out.\nThe images show a timeline of the build cycle, including photos of the stringent acceptance tests and quality controls before the cars are shipped to customers.\nOne job is to connect the 1,479bhp W16 engine to the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission - a combination capable of 261mph\nEvery component is constructed by hand and there are no robots in sight. The only electronic tool used in chassis assembly is the 'EC nutrunner system', which gives the assembly worker a signal when the right torque value is reached\nJust 20 technicians work at the facility with 12 cars being produced at a time and 70 made every year in total\nFrom the moment the customer finalises the order to delivery it takes approximately six months - not bad for a bespoke £2million car\nEach example is subject to a unique specification determined by the owner, so 20 staff members are working to very different and equally very strict request sheets on every single model.\nThis includes any of 23 standard topcoat colours and eight carbon variants for the exterior, while buyers would have also sifted through a brochure of 31 different leather and eight Alcantara colours before making a decision on the cabin design.\nOh, there are also 30 stitching, 18 carpet and 11 belt colours to choose from too.\nThis picture shows the technicians attaching the rear end to the carbon-fibre monocoque chassis\nBugatti's rolling dynamometer is the most powerful of its type in the world and is used throughout the production cycle to ensure the vehicle runs correctly\nAny excess power generated by the high-performance dyno is fed back to the local grid in Molsheim\nOne of the most striking design elements of the Chiron is the side panel, with a large curving reverse 'C' wrapping around the door via the A pillar. It's also the largest single exterior carbon fibre part in the car industry, Bugatti claims\nPay a little extra (on top of the €2.4million price tag) and you can create your own colour, have your initials etched into the rear spoiler, or have a message embroidered into the centre console - we wonder how many times the technicians have to check the spelling.\nThe process revealed by Bugatti highlights the painstaking work going into the build of each of the hypercars and goes some way to explaining why buyers are willing to stump up such a high price for this exclusive piece of motoring art.\nIt takes the skilled craftsmen a total of three days to fit the interior parts. The pressure is on to get it exactly to the customer's order, which includes a variation of trim colours and materials\nEach element of the build is painstakingly checked. In this image, the technician is checking the setting of the rear-view camera\nThis is the 'light tunnel' where a certified team member carries out a relentless inspection of the finish for more than six hours before the car is given his final approval of the finish\nCar fans may think they could look at the Bugatti Chiron for more than six hours with ease - it is undeniably beautiful\nChristophe Piochon, member of the Bugatti Board of Management responsible for production and logistics, watches over the full process and is the man to point fingers when something isn't up to exacting standards.\n'Here in Molsheim, we have a small factory with a small warehouse,' he said.\n'Neither our equipment nor our procedures can be compared with those of other car plants.' It's certainly hard to argue with him!\nEach Chiron features an 8.0-litre, W16-cylinder, quad-turbo engine featuring two-stage inter-cooling\nThe number of quality checks is incredible. This tool is used to ensure the panel gaps are all precisely the same\nEvery Chiron is subject to a rain test that replicates monsoon conditions with varying intensity for 30 minutes to show that there are no leaks\nReady to go: And here's the final product, in all its £2million of glory, the highly exclusive Bugatti Chiron\nBugatti says even the floor in the atelier is special.\nAccording to the French marque, it is made from epoxy and is conductive, 'ensuring the dissipation of any electrostatic charges'.\nSounds fancy. But it doesn't end there: 'In addition, the reflecting glossy white creates an atmosphere comparable with the catwalk of a fashion house.' Not our words - those are the words of a a £2million car builder.\nEvery Chiron is test driven 300 km (186.4 miles) through the Vosges mountain to the airport in Colmar, where it completes test of functions requiring speeds in excess of 155mph on the runway\nChristophe Piochon, member of the Bugatti Board of Management responsible for production and logistics, said the equipment and procedures used by Bugatti can't be compared with other car plants - and he has a point\nThe production facility is located in Molsheim near Strasbourg in the north east of France at the carmaker's headquarters\n'We are building a super sports car. That is quite clear,' Mr Piochon added.\n'But it is the way we do it, hand-crafting an individual product for each customer in this very special atmosphere, that makes us unique.'\nFeast your eyes on the glossy pictures provided and dream away.\nMIND-MELDING FACTS ABOUT THE BUGATTI CHIRON\nAt $2.4 million (£2.0 million) the Chiron is the most expensive 'high-production' car in the world in 2017\nThe world's first production sports car with 1500hp (at 6700rpm) – almost 300hp more than the Veyron it replaces\nMaximum speed is 261mph with 0-62mph in less than 2.5 seconds\nThe two main catalytic converters are six times as large as the unit fitted to an average family car\nThe active surface of all six catalytic converters corresponds to an area greater than 30 football pitches\nThe transmission has the largest, highest performance clutch fitted to a passenger car\nMonocoque chassis is as rigid an an LMP1 race car\nNew braking system features Formula One technical modules\nThe electrical system has the electromagnetic compatibility comparable to that of a military vehicle\nBugatti emblem crafted from solid 970 fine silver and enamel\nMore than 60,000 litres of air per minute are pushed through the engine\nIn one minute, 800 litres of water are circulated through the engine\nChiron has 10 radiators, the most sophisticated and highest performing cooling system fitted to a sports car", "external_links": ["http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/car-insurance-finder", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-08T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:41:42.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
