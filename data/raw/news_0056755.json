Naturally, Podesta brought up Russia and the FBI. \nHe talks about “the production of fake news that became fodder in the campaign” and overtook a lot of other issues in the final month of the campaign, reiterating that the Comey letter did “enormous damage.” \nAs for the release of his emails by WikiLeaks, Podesta said that his family was harassed and attacked, so the whole ordeal was “obviously painful” to them. \nBut he still maintained his criticisms of the FBI’s handling of the situation, calling it “inexplicable that they were so casual about first the investigation of the Russian penetration of the DNC emails, they didn’t even bother to send an agent to the DNC.” \nThis in part led him to conclude that it’s certainly a possibility there are “forces within the FBI” that wanted Clinton to lose. \nYou can watch the full conversation above, via NewCo. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:56:59.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
