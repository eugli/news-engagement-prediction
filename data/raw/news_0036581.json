As reported by the Inquisitr , a source close to the Trump Family claimed Melania was “miserable” and “unhappy” in her role in the White House, and warned folks not to be fooled by Mrs. Trump’s smile in certain photos. However, Mrs. Trump offered plenty of smiles, as seen in the below photos and video, as Melania and President Donald Trump welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Sara Netanyahu, his wife, into the White House.

On that day, former President Barack Obama and Mrs. Michelle Obama welcomed Mr. and Mrs. Trump inside the White House for tea and desserts, but those photos from inside the White House were not made public. Instead, plenty of photos of Melania and President Trump outside of the White House were taken that day, as Mrs. Trump presented Mrs. Obama with a gift. \nThe publication also notes that Melania lightened her hair, which can be seen in closer-up photos below. [Image by Evan Vucci/AP Images] \nAs seen in the above photos, President Trump chose a dark suit in contrast to the blue suit worn by the Prime Minister. First Lady Melania’s donned a white suit that stood in contrast to the pink or mauve tone of Sara’s ensemble as the foursome walked into the White House. \nAccording to WWD , Melania’s white suit was made by Karl Lagerfeld – and just as Mrs. Trump has previously chosen white outfits, she also once again donned a white ensemble that was made out of cashmere. Melania’s pencil skirt and jacket were coupled with high heel pumps that appeared to be off-white or cream in tone.

Melania was there inside the East Room of the White House to listen to a joint news conference between her husband and Prime Minister Netanyahu.

With Netanyahu attempting to strengthen ties with Trump’s administration following eight years of run-ins with President Obama regarding Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians, the news conference is getting plenty of publicity. \nAs reported by the Associated Press , Mr. Trump tried to persuade the prime minister to “hold off” on settlements for some period of time.

[Image by Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images] \nVideos of the greetings between the couples also began to get buzz, as Sara was seen urging her husband to greet Melania. As seen in the above video from Fox 10 Phoenix , Mr. and Mrs. Trump walked outside the White House and waited for their guests and made small talk as the prime minister and his wife arrived. \nAs Mr. Trump talked with the prime minister and shook his hand, Melania and Sara spoke with one another. Eventually, Sara prodded her husband to greet Melania, and the duo kissed each other on each cheek. President Trump shook Sara’s hand. Then the foursome turned around and posed for photos before Melania made a move to usher them all inside.

[Image by Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images] \nThe above and below photos of Mr. and Mrs. Trump were taken as they waited outside the White House for their guests. [Image by Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images] \nWith Melania spending plenty of time in Trump Tower in New York City, photos of Mrs. Trump inside the White House are a hotly-buzzed about item.
