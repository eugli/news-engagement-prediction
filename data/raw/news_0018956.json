And comparing the two most legendary quarterbacks of our times winning the last two Super Bowls. … \nTom Brady, after winning Super Bowl LI – First person he kissed: His son \nPeyton Manning, after winning Super Bowl 50 – First person he kissed: Papa John \nTom Brady, after winning Super Bowl LI – Most memorable postgame quote: “I’m so proud of our guys, the coaches, the team, it’s just unbelievable what these guys have accomplished. I’m just so proud to be a part of this great group.” \nPeyton Manning, after winning Super Bowl 50 – Most memorable postgame quote: “I’m going to drink a lot of Budweiser tonight, Tracy, I promise you that.” \nTom Brady, after winning Super Bowl LI – Most memorable quote the next day: “It’s an honor to be here and have the commissioner present us with the trophy. It certainly means a lot and my kids will be happy to see that trophy.” \nPeyton Manning, after winning Super Bowl 50 – Most memorable quote the next day: “I’ve had a few Budweisers and it’s been a special night.” \nIf you’re looking for the perfect way to sum up why I have nothing but heart eyes for Tom Brady and despise Peyton Manning with white hot intensity of a million black vinyl car seats, here it is in a nutshell. One guy came from nothing, conducts himself with dignity and humility and, even though he’s achieved things so one ever has, puts family and team ahead of himself. \nThe other was to the manor born. A legend’s kid who had life handed to him by a white gloved butler on a platinum platter. And he celebrates an improbable championship at the end of his career by doing more product shilling than the entire NASCAR circuit put together. \nBrady pays tribute to family, team and fans. Peyton does his best to keep America diabetic. It’s what I’ve said throughout their whole time in the league together. Manning’s public image is a pure marketing creation. This Aw Shucks everyman who hangs out eating lunch in a diner and has folks over for gameday is a character invented by advertisers. No more real than Mr. Clean or Ronald McDonald. But we buy in the way we thought Bill Cosby was America’s dad who acted goofy when he hawked instant pudding. \nSo one of the lesser, ancillary benefits of Super Bowl LI is we got the perfect look at the difference between the two guys in the biggest one-on-one rivalry since Bird and Magic. And when it comes to class, like it does with rings, it’s not even close.
