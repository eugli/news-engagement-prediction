Her total remuneration was more than double the £1.05m she had received in 2014, as her £550,000 salary was bolstered by a £1.97m pay out under TalkTalk’s long-term incentive plan. \nThe company cut her cash bonus in half, from £432,000 to £220,000, as a result of the cyber-attack. She donated the bonus to the chaity Ambitious about Autism in recognition of the problems caused by the attack. \nTristia Harrison, currently the managing director of TalkTalk’s Consumer operation, will take over from Harding as chief executive. Harrison, who has been on the TalkTalk board since 2014, has worked at the company for seven years. \nCharles Dunstone, the non-executive chairman of TalkTalk, will step into the role of executive chairman after he steps down as the chair of Dixons Carphone on 1 May. \n“I’m excited at the prospect of spending more time on TalkTalk, beginning with delivering another successful performance this year,” he said. \nDunstone said that Harding had been a “tireless, energetic and effective force for good from the day she joined”. \n“She has helped transform TalkTalk into a much stronger business,” he said. “She leaves with our thanks and very best wishes for the future.” \nIn October, TalkTalk was hit with a record £400,000 fine for the security failings that led to the company being hacked in October 2015 . \nThe hack resulted in the attacker accessing the personal information of more than 150,000 customers of the internet service provider, including sensitive financial data for more than 15,000 people. \nThe previous highest fine ever issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office was £350,000, against Prodial, a spam-calling company responsible for more than 46m automated nuisance calls.
