Res. 40, which was specifically aimed at the Social Security gun ban. The resolution passed by a vote of 253-180 and USA Today reports that the vote was “largely along party lines.”\nThe intent of the vote was clear. Just last week, Republicans announced their intentions to hold a vote to kill the Social Security gun ban . The House vote alone does not abolish it — the Senate must also act — but it does get Republicans a step closer to removing an Obama administration ban that could otherwise curtail the Second Amendment rights of perhaps millions of Social Security beneficiaries.\nYet Politico reported the House vote thus:\nDemocrats ripped the move as an effort by Republicans to undermine background checks for gun purchasers. After the House vote, Sen. Dianne Feinstein pleaded with supporters to rally against the move in the Senate. “Senate may vote today to weaken background checks on gun purchases. Call your Senator to oppose this change —ensure your voice is heard!” she wrote.\nPolitico titled their story: “House votes to rescind Obama gun background check rule.”\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins , a Breitbart News podcast.
