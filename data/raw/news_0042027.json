Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA shocked teenage lesbian couple were told off for kissing by a Morrisons security guard - who claimed they were \"putting people off their food\". \nThe supermarket chain is investigating the claim that he shouted at the young pair: \"It is disgusting.\" \nChloe Arrandale, from from Eccles, and her girlfriend Louise Taylor, from Ashton, were stunned when the security guard took offence - and began 'swearing'. \nThe couple, who are both 18-years-old, were eating in the supermarket chain's café in Eccles on Thursday between 5:30pm and 6pm when the incident happened. \nLouise says she simply put her arm around Chloe and gave her a kiss because she was \"not feeling great\". \nHowever, their lunch date turned sour when the security guard - who was also eating in the café at the time - began shouting and swearing at them before saying: \"You should go outside if you want to act like that\". Chloe and Louise were enjoying a lunch date at the time of the outburst (Photo: Guzelian) \n\"I want an apology from this man and for him to admit what he has done is wrong,\" said Chloe, a college student. \n\"Love is love. If he has these opinions then he should just keep them to himself and not just go screaming at two young girls. \n\"All she did was sit next to me, put her arm around me and gave me a kiss because I was not feeling well. It wasn't a really long, sloppy snog. \n\"I have been going to this Morrisons since I was young and the staff are always great. \n\"We come to the store almost every day after college. We don't blame Morrisons for this, as we have never had any problems. \n\"It was just the actions of one particular person.\" Morrisons is investigating what happened at the store branch in Eccles (Photo: Darren O'Brien/Guzelian) \nThe security guard had been eating while the couple were in the café but was called away to deal with something after an announcement was made over the speaker system. \nThe couple actually felt sorry for the man as all he was doing was trying to eat before he was called into action. \nIt was on his return to the café that the security guard suddenly started shouting at them, leaving a shocked Louise to escort her upset girlfriend from the store.

We were both just really confused as to why he just suddenly started shouting. But later this turned to anger. \n\"It is 2017. No one should be spoken to like that.\" \nChloe's mother, Beth Arrandale, was shocked when she heard what had happened to her daughter and her girlfriend. \nShe posted on Facebook about the incident and shared it to Morrisons official page as well, before Chloe posted about it herself. \nBeth's post said: \"I'm absolutely disgusted with the ignorant, homophobic and disgraceful treatment of my daughter and her girlfriend by staff at Morrisons in Eccles!!! \n\"All they did was have a little kiss (just a peck on the lips) whilst having something to eat in the cafe. Chloe, 18, thanked her mum for sticking up for her (Photo: Guzelian) Read More \n\"They were then confronted by an idiotic and clearly homophobic 'security guard' and told they had to get out of Morrisons, that they were disgusting and apparently putting people off their food! \n\"If they want to carry on with 'that' kind of behaviour then to do it outside!!! \n\"Nothing said to the straight couple though, who were sat next to them, who also happened to be cuddling and kissing!!! It's 2017 ffs (sic).\" \nMorrisons have said that the individual was from their security supplier and that they are currently investigating the incident. \nA Morrisons spokesperson said: \"We take this allegation extremely seriously and we are raising it with our security supplier at this store to find out what happened.\" Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T14:30:12.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
