The deal was immediately criticized by regulators and some in the industry concerned it would hike health care prices for Americans. \nIt's the second roadblock a federal judge has put up for an attempted health care merger since the beginning of the year. Aetna's plans to takeover Humana for $37 billion was frozen by a federal judge last month.
