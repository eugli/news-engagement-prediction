Michael Floyd (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:28 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:28 p.m. ET \nMichael Floyd will need to abide by some strict restrictions as he serves his sentence for drunk driving. \nThe Patriots receiver began serving his 120-day sentence for DUI on Feb. 16 in Arizona, but will be allowed to leave jail and move to home detention starting March 13, ESPN.com reported . \nBut once he is home, Floyd won't be able to indulge in anything with alcohol in it, including basic mouthwash and medicines that contain alcohol. To make sure he isn't sneaking any booze, Floyd will have to use a device that monitors is blood alcohol content. \nOn top of staying 100 percent sober, he will not be allowed to leave Arizona unless a legal motion is filed, according to Scottsdale City Court records cited by ESPN.com. \nThat could be problematic for Floyd, who is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent on March 9. If he can't leave the state, he can't work out with any teams aside from the Cardinals. \nThe Cardinals cut Floyd once he was arrested, but was signed by the Patriots on Dec. 15. He went on to help New England defeat the Falcons in Super Bowl 51.
