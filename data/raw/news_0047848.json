Great acting, great music, but most of all, amazing visual effects! Thank you Walt Disney! This movie is great by KbCheetah This movie is great, fun, wonderful, terrific, amazing, and awesome. I love this movie a lot. I love Julie Andrews plays Mary Poppins in it. I love all of the songs in it and it is one of my favorite movies ever. Supercalafragalistic! by Hizboss33 I have loved this movie since i was young, i have since had three children who love it as well.. My oldest now 16 was only baby and i mean baby (infant) who would sit in bouncer, swing, floor, highchair and watch without moving an inch, unless u turned it off, he would scream until turned back on .. So u see who can go wrong with a movie that even can calm an infant for hours!!!!
