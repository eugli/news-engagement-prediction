Klopp showed me the way. \n“He supported me and told me I had to keep my head up because good things were coming. He helped me to become a player.\" \nMkhitaryan also feels that Klopp is not too different from Mourinho and says that he has had to learn to adapt to working with the Portuguese following his switch from Dortmund. \n\"They are both very friendly and very good at their jobs but the way they work is different,” he added. \nSuper Mane sparks Liverpool into life \n\"It is the first year under Jose's management and we are working very hard. He tells us what he wants to see. Of course, it is not very easy when you have a new manager. \n\"You have to adapt to him and the team, the training sessions and the games. At the beginning we had a little bit of difficulties but then we started winning in November.\" Related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T13:51:08.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
