I’ve heard that Boston has still given some consideration. Chicago’s another team that’s been said to have shown some Okafor interest.” \nOkafor is a former No. 3 pick who isn’t getting that much playing time with Philly in his second NBA season. He’s averaging just 23 minutes per game, but he’s been relatively efficient in that time, shooting 51 percent from the floor while scoring 11.4 points and pulling down 4.8 rebounds per game. \nOn the surface, Okafor gives the Celtics some needed size, but he’s not the prototypical big man. The 4.8 rebounds per game obviously doesn’t jump off the page in a good way, and even if you look at the rebounds per 36 minutes figure, Okafor still is averaging just 7.5 boards. \nMaybe a change of scenery would get Okafor back on track, but it obviously depends on the price whether a trade would be worthwhile for the Celtics. \nThumbnail photo via Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:41:30.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
