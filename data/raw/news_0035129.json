By Alanna Vagianos \nTwo best friends had a heartbreaking conversation about body image and their self-worth. \nProduced by The Scene , the video features two best friends , Tiffany and Alyssa, discussing the things they don’t like about their own bodies. But instead of saying what they don’t like about their bodies to themselves, the two women direct these negative body image comments at one another. The result is a powerful commentary on how so many women correlate their size to their self-worth. \nThe video was originally published in October 2016, but is making the rounds again after The Scene posted the video to Facebook on Thursday. \n“Just a reminder, I love you very much,” Alyssa, an actress who’s battled anorexia, tells Tiffany before they begin. Tiffany is a producer who says she has struggled with body image her entire life. For the next minute and a half the women direct their own negative thoughts at one another. “Everyone is skinnier and prettier than you,” Alyssa says. “The people behind you are staring at the way your fat hangs over your bra,” Tiffany replies. They continue, telling each other their most negative thoughts: “You look so ugly in pictures that I can’t even look at them anymore.” “He would’ve never cheated on you if you were skinnier.” “You would be more successful if you lost 15 pounds.” “You will never be able to go sleeveless, not even on your wedding day.” Afterwards, they apologize to each other through tears. \nOne week after the original video was shot, Tiffany and Alyssa sat down again to discuss their conversation. “Wow I am hurting myself so much, all the time,” Alyssa says. “You just have to always pretend like you’re talking to me,” Tiffany replied. At the end, the two hug it out and make a point to treat themselves like they would treat one another. \nThe last frame in the video makes an important point, with the screen reading: “Why do we say things to ourselves that we wouldn’t ever say to (or think about) our best friends? Be a best friend to yourself.” \nIf you’re struggling with an eating disorder, call the National Eating Disorder Association hotline at 1-800-931-2237.
