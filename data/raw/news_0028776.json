Now, for some people, that would not be notable in the slightest. But for Markle, a lifestyle blogger with a penchant for sharing recommendations and recipes and the like, this represents a great departure from her previous social-media-happy behavior. Of course, what has changed in the past few months is that Markle has started dating one of the most-profile men in the world, the man fifth in line to the British throne. Subject to so much scrutiny that the Kensington Palace had to release a statement asking for her privacy to be protected, Markle has kept a very low profile since the relationship began (for example, she has not done any press for the new season of Suits ). The actress returned to Instagram Sunday afternoon, however (yes, Markle has ascended in fame to “It’s notable every time she posts on Instagram” levels). The shot features her cat-face-emblazoned flats ( expect those to sell out immediately ), positioned in front of the scripted hashtag “#NOBADENERGY.” Her caption reads: “Sending good vibes – always in all ways #nobadenergy #bethechange.” Based on the latest reports about her relationship with Harry, all would seem to be moving along swimmingly: she reportedly met Kate Middleton (and gifted her with a dream journal ); she reportedly went to Norway with her boyfriend to see the Northern Lights; and she stepped out for a Soho House dinner date with him just last week, the first time they were photographed holding hands . So maybe her post is just meant as a general reminder, for all of us, to not let ourselves get overwhelmed with bad vibes. Or perhaps there is a more specific reason . . . Did she find out from a friend that Kate re-gifted the dream journal? Did she notice the organic flaxseed biscuits she made Harry yesterday had been thrown in the trash? Or maybe one of her Suits castmates accidentally sent a “So is Meghan too good for our group text now??!” text to the group text instead of separately to one other castmate? In the meantime, let us not forget our charge: #nobadenergy. What Do Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton Have In Common? High-School Throwback. \nMarkle’s yearbook picture was circulated widely last week, after news of her relationship with Harry broke. Meanwhile, Kate (who is one year younger than Markle) was probably about the same age, when this shot was taken. (The way Kate has that jacket draped casually across her back is downright inspirational.) Photo: Left, From Seth Poppel/Yearbook Library; right, By Stephen Lock/Rex/Shutterstock. Life’s a Stage. \nMarkle is most famous for her role on Suits as lawyer Rachel Zane (viewership for the next season of the show promises to increase by at least 200 percent, right?). Kate, you may be surprised to learn, once hit the stage, as well, performing in a school production of My Fair Lady at age 11. Photo: Left, From Getty Images. Blazing Ahead. \n“Oh hi, we both look more effortlessly glam in a blazer than you will ever look in anything your entire life.” Photo: Left, By Ray Tamarra/GC Images/Getty Images; right, By Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images. Compliments to the Chef. \nMarkle has a lifestyle blog, the Tig, and is a cooking obsessive (she listed a number of culinary types—plus Gwyneth Paltrow —when asked whom she’d invite to her dream dinner). And Kate may not love cooking, per se (William once said her cooking was the reason he was “so skinny”), but you wouldn’t know it from her glee at donning this chef’s outfit.

Seeing Red. \nYou just know Us Weekly is going to be publishing these two looks side by side for an upcoming “Who Wore It Best?” Photo: Left, by Ray Tamarra/GC Images; right, by Pool/Sam Hussein/WireImage. On the Court. \nAt some point soon, it seems safe to bet Kate and Meghan will have to play a mixed doubles tennis match with Harry and William, no? (“I finally have a partner to play with,” Harry will joke, as, all the while, George will sit on a small throne “officiating” on the side of the court.)

These two seem destined to get along famously—and perhaps will soon be re-creating these similar expressions, over the holidays, when Prince Charles decides to stand up and sing an impromptu carol for everyone.
