Both are great covers ‚Äî shoutout to that \"demand an orgasm every time\" cover line in particular ‚Äî however neither technically feature sneakers (because neither are full-length shots). That doesn't mean Nicki wasn't wearing the shoes for her cover shoot though, and her tweets continue to make a great point: Just go on google, you'll see all the different pairs he's named after me.

Nicki claimed in her tweets that her people had recently tried to contact Zanotti ‚Äî presumably to work on a \"capsule collection\" with him ‚Äî and were rebuffed, rudely: Recently when he gave other artists capsule collections, my agency reached out and was told they're not taking our call. ü§î ‚Äî NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) February 3, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Don't care about the money.
