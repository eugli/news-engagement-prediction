They’ve got him isolated and barricaded and they don’t expect it to take very long.” \nA hospital worker, named Dan, told local CBS affiliate KHOU that staff been receiving text messages, saying there was a gunman reported on the second floor of the facility, before they were all evacuated. \n“We heard over the overhead that their was a Code White, for an active shooter then we got text messages saying there was an active shooter,” he said. “We heard he was on the second floor. It was definitely scary. I called all my parents.” \nHospital staff had been reportedly taking cover under their desks after receiving word of the possible active shooter. \n“Some actually sheltered in place,” Acevedo said, adding that multiple witnesses had reported seeing a bald, white man carrying a gun. \n“All patients and employees are safe at this point,” he added.
