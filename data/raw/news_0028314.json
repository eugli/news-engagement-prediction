There are reduced limits on some lakes and rivers. \nAnyone looking to take fish out of the province will also need a licence. \nThe free fishing weekend doesn’t apply to national parks and anglers on Lac La Ronge must have a free endorsement and associated harvest ledger, which can be obtained for free from private issuers, the Ministry of Environment and select provincial parks. \nREAD MORE: Extremely dangerous ice rescues in Saskatoon on the rise \nOfficials are reminding everyone that safety is a key to having an enjoyable ice fishing experience. \nIce thickness should be tested before venturing out.
