Sasikala is not the person people voted for. Everyone knows that” adding, “Only a democratically elected person should become the CM of Tamil Nadu.” \n“To become a chief minister being with someone for 33 years is not a qualification,” Deepa said. \nRejecting the clarifications given by doctors who treated Jayalalithaa during her last 75 days, she said, “I am not satisfied with the clarification given by doctors treating Jayalalithaa.” \n“From day one I was asking the hospital to allow me inside but the hospital denied and they never allowed me, never got in touch with me,” she said. \n“All they want to establish by excluding me from clinical decisions on Jayalalithaa is that I'm not family,” Deepa alleged. \nClaiming that people of the state are worried over the looming political instability in the state, Deepa reiterated her intention to contest elections. \nOn Sasikala's control over the party, she said, “People are scared of her, I am not.” \n“I am here because of my aunt Jayalalithaa, want to complete tasks that she's left behind,” Deepa added. \nDeepa's comments came amidst uncertainty over the swearing-in of Sasikala. While the AIADMK legislature party has backed her and requested the Governor to do the needful, Governor Rao appears to be playing the wait and watch game given the possibility of the Supreme Court giving its verdict in the disproportionate assets case against Sasikala. \nMeanwhile, senior AIADMK leader had rebelled against Sasikala. Questioning her suitability to take over CM, Pandian has cast apprehensions on the reasons behind Jayalaithaa's death. \nHe has claimed that Jayalalithaa was pushed down stairs at her Poes Garden residence and was shifted to the hospital to cover up the crime.
