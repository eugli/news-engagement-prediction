Labour in crisis: Can the party reconnect with its heartland? Read more \nThe pair are both regarded as rising stars of the 2015 intake of MPs from the left of the party, and Long-Bailey was promoted in last week’s reshuffle , after four shadow ministers resigned over Corbyn’s Brexit stance. \nAccording to the Sunday Times, the focus group responses to Rayner were “overwhelmingly negative”. \nThe MP for Ashton-under-Lyne was judged by the group to be “not likeable”, a “bit charity shop-looking” and “weird”, with one participant suggesting voters would not take her seriously, the newspaper reported. \nLong-Bailey, a former lawyer and the MP for Salford and Eccles, was viewed more favourably with the group describing her as “passionate”, “genuine”, “sincere” and “very smart”, although some saw her as “aggressive” and “rough”. \nA Labour source insisted the focus group had nothing to do with the future of the leadership. \n“In common with all political parties, Labour conducts polling to get a clearer picture of views in different parts of the country,” they told the Guardian. Clive Lewis dismisses talk he could challenge Corbyn for leadership Read more \n“Polling of northern voters was about how best to get Labour’s message across in the north and has nothing at all to do with ‘succession planning’.” \nThe source added that similar exercises will be carried out in other parts of the country. \nCorbyn’s team had already been forced to deny rumours last week that the 67-year-old leader had named a date for his departure. \nVoters also appear to have been sceptical about Corbyn’s appeal in the focus group. \nThe group, organised by Labour’s pollster BMG Research, found Corbyn to be “boring”, said he appeared “fed up” and “looks like a scruffy school kid”. \nThe Labour source refused to comment on suggestions the polling also pointed to Labour being reduced to 198 seats to the Tories’ 361 if a general election were held in the coming months.
