Spain detains vacationing programmer 'at FBI’s request' \nThe FBI claims that Lisov, 31, is the creator and administrator of NeverQuest, a banking trojan that has defrauded thousands of people, allegedly to the tune of $5 million. \nThe US agency, which obtained an Interpol arrest warrant, said it has been investigating the suspect since 2014 and is now demanding his extradition. \nBut Lisov, who was arrested on January 13 while vacationing in Catalonia, says that he has not been allowed to study the charges. \n“I’ve just been told that I am charged, nothing else,” said Lisov, who is resident in Taganrog on Russia’s Black Sea coast. “From what I understand, even the local policemen trusted with detaining me had no clue.” \n“They kept asking me random questions, such as ‘Did you break into the Pentagon? What about the FBI or the CIA?’ That’s the entirety of the interrogation I’ve faced so far.” \nLisov denied any connection to the NeverQuest trojan - which attaches itself to social media and email files, steals personal data, and then logs into online accounts, before making financial withdrawals. \n“I develop and provide tech support for websites, and have done the same work for the past seven years, maybe longer. I mostly have worked for online retail businesses,” said Lisov, who has employed a Spanish and a Russian lawyer to represent him. \nThe programmer said he previously applied to work in the US – in 2013, the same year NeverQuest first emerged – but was turned down “because [he] might have overstayed to carry on working there.” Read more Sorry, hackers, but squirrels winning the cyber war - security expert \nLisov’s wife Darya, who was the conduit for the phone call, said although her husband refused to speculate, they were “ ninety-percent certain that the case is politically motivated.” \nWestern security agencies, particularly those of the US and the UK, have accused Russia of using its hacking prowess to acquire confidential data, though mostly for political, not economic gain. \nMoscow denies all such claims. Without speculating about Lisov’s innocence or guilt following his arrest, Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned however that the Kremlin would “not allow infringement of the interests of Russians.” \nAlexander Ionov, the vice-president of the Russian branch of the International Human Rights Committee, said Russia should have been informed in advance of any planned operation to capture Lisov, and said his arrest was a “violation of human rights, tantamount to a kidnapping.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:01:21.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
