Her fetus bump, right? https://t.co/CcgtTubuRX \n— Amanda Prestigiacomo (@AmandaPresto) February 13, 2017 Trending SHAME! NPR contributor (who also happens to be a refugee) charged with assault in DeVos 'protest' \nNo no, it’s only a fetus when it’s not someone famous. Duh. @Cosmopolitan @Beyonce Remember that time you tweeted about more babies being born and followed it with a sad emoji? \n— Jeanne (@sleepy_jeannie) February 13, 2017 \nWe remember! But again, those weren’t famous babies being born so they didn’t count or something. @Cosmopolitan why is her bump a big deal? It's not like there is a baby in there or anything. It's just clumps of cells \n— Jordan Davis (@MGoJordan) February 13, 2017 \nAnd really Beyonce herself is just a clump of cells … we all are. \nIt’s science. \n— The Farisa (@farisa2020) February 13, 2017 \nHrm, good question. Guessing since it’s some magical baby in Beyonce’s womb the answer is YES. @Cosmopolitan @Beyonce is she pregnant with a child or a fetus? \n— Airborne Heel (@abnheel) February 13, 2017 \nUnicorn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:31:46.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
