Michael Reaves / Getty Images \nFloyd Mayweather Jr and Conor McGregor have a number of things in common. \nThey both play up to a brash, money-loving persona. They both need no invitation to get on the microphone and they both have a popularity that transcends their sport. \nThere has been wild speculation for months about a match-up between the pair in the ring, and last week The Sun reported that a fight could be confirmed in a matter of weeks. \nIt would likely play out in front of thousands of fans, willing to part with $1,500 (£1,200) for a \"cheap seat\" in Las Vegas, with millions watching at home in front of a $100 pay-per-view paywall. \nMoney seems to be the only logic behind matching all-time great boxer Mayweather against popular mixed martial artist McGregor. Whatever the result, both fighters will leave the ring considerably richer, but will the fight be any good? It's billed as a \"super-fight,\" but will it deliver? \nNo. It looks likely that the fight will take place under boxing regulations (McGregor obtained a California boxing licence in 2016, but still requires a Nevada license to box in Vegas), meaning it will be a mile away from the a UFC Octagon. \nMatching Mayweather and McGregor on these terms is like asking Mo Farah to race Usain Bolt over 100 metres. There are elite-level names present, yes, but there's only going to be one obvious result. \nFloyd Mayweather versus knockout specialist Gennady Golovkin would be a super-fight. Conor McGregor versus the Tyron Woodley / Stephen Thompson winner at UFC 209 would be a superfight. But this? A circus. Why McGregor doesn't stand a chance \nMayweather is a defensive wizard. Al Bello / Getty Images \nGloves in boxing cover the whole fist, thumb and a large part of the wrist. They also weigh between eight and ten ounces. \nBoxing gloves are so big that, providing an athlete can keep their gloves up in a peek-a-boo-style they can block a number of straight head-level punches and only need to move their guard when it comes to hooks, body-shots or throwing something back. \nMMA gloves are fingerless, weigh four ounces and are so small that they would make an unreliable shield. When it comes to defence inside a cage, athletes have to be aware of punches, elbows, knees, and kicks. The number of striking points is significantly larger and that is without even mentioning grappling and takedowns. \nStriking in mixed martial arts and striking in boxing are therefore very different and regardless of how brutal a striker he is in MMA or how well he trains, McGregor will be ill-prepared for a boxing contest with the greatest defensive prizefighter this side of Pernell Whitaker. \nFloyd is a master at making them miss and making them pay. Al Bello / Getty Images \nMayweather will make McGregor miss and he will make him pay. Mayweather is renowned for his evasive skills but his countering and inside-fighting are equally exceptional. \nMuch will be made of Floyd Jr having not boxed since his one-sided victory over Andre Berto in 2015, his advancing age (he would be 40 by the time he gets back in the ring) and that the opponent, McGregor, has renowned one punch knockout power in his straight left shot. \nBut Mayweather will still have more than enough to pot-shot and outpoint his opponent. Will there be an undercard? \nYes. \nInterestingly, former pound-for-pound king Roy Jones Jr has called out UFC great Anderson Silva for another boxing versus MMA showdown. \nBoth fighters are past their respective primes (Silva is 41 and Jones Jr is 48) but both carry enough name value in their respective sports to draw in an audience. \nRoy Jones vs Anderson Silva and Mayweather vs McGregor double headline card UFC invasion. Would be biggest event of all time period — Roy Jones Jr. (@RealRoyJonesJr) February 23, 2017 Show me the money! \nFloyd Mayweather's name features in all of the top three best-selling boxing pay-per-views of all-time. \nHis 2007 split-decision victory over Oscar de la Hoya thrust him into super stardom and attracted an extraordinary 2.4 million paid to watch the fight in the US. \nSix years later, his majority decision win over Canelo Alvarez attracted 2.2 million pay-per-view fans but his comfortable points victory over welterweight rival Manny Pacquiao attracted an even bigger US audience of 4.6 million. \nWith a fellow star on the opposite side of the fight poster, Mayweather and McGregor could shatter pay-per-view records and attract 5 million. At $100 each that equals $500 million in pay-per-view revenue. \nMcGregor is most famous for his 13-second KO over Jose Aldo. Steve Marcus / Getty Images \nMayweather only ever fights in Las Vegas and if he did return for a 50th bout then he will likely head back to the MGM Grand, which has a 16,500 capacity. \nIf a Mayweather Jr and McGregor showdown mirrors the ticket strategy of Floyd's fight with Manny Pacquiao, then the cheapest ticket could be bought for $1,500, with the most expensive reaching $7,500. \nIf the average Mayweather vs McGregor ticket costs $3,000 then the total revenue at the gate would push $50 million. Put it together and you're talking half a billion dollars on TV and tickets in the US alone. \nThere will only be one winner in the ring, but both will be laughing all the way to the bank after this circus of a super-fight. But I, for one, will be watching every minute of it. This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.
