Some Congress members have chosen not to show up in public, accusing the protesters of using political theater to bait them into controversy. \nTrump criticized the protesters Wednesday with a tweet saying they were organized by \"liberal activists.\" The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists. Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2017 \nWhich is the case — although many speakers have spoken out at the Town Halls have had their own personal motivations. \nAnd none of it is groundbreaking — or exclusive to the left. \nOrganizers of the current movement, including the MoveOn-led coalition that calls its campaign ResistanceRecess, say they were inspired by the tea party, which did pretty much the same thing in the summer of 2009. Some of the organizers worked for Democratic lawmakers targeted for their stances on the Affordable Care Act — a relentlessly local effort that sparked an uprising that helped dismantle the Democrats' majorities in Congress. \nThe Democratic organizers freely admit to taking pages from the tea party playbook. But they also credit HIV/AIDS activists, who since the 1980s have been bird-dogging lawmakers into taking positions on their cause. \nThey often use students, because \"they're cute and they get called on\" at campaign or town hall events, said Hilary McQuie, director of U.S. policy and grassroots mobilization for Health Gap. \"And it shows them they can be engaged in the political process, not just voting, but the followup.\" \nIt was a student who got Trump, as a candidate to make a statement in support of increased funding for AIDS treatment .

Stuart Ramson / AP \nHIV/AIDS activists are among those bird-dogging the Republican town halls this week on the Affordable Care Act, McQuie said. \nBen Wikler, MoveOn's Washington director, said he was motivated by a much earlier instance of bird-dogging: a 1989 onslaught of former Illinois congressman Dan Rostenkowski, one of the most powerful men in Congress, by a group of senior citizens angry about costly changes to a federal health insurance program. Rostenkowski said afterward that the protesters \"don't understand what the government was trying to do for them.\" Three months later, the law was repealed. \n\"I started sending this video around and saying, \"This is what it'll take. If the ACA is to be saved, it will take this kind of citizen outrage,\" Wikler said. \nPeople like Esprey are trying to help help channel that anger. \n\"Blessed be the fighters,\" he said at the conclusion of his training call last week. \"Blessed be the agitators. And, yes, blessed be the hecklers.\" Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:23:30.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
