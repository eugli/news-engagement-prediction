It changes colour to red or green at the same time as the signals do, the council of Bodegraven-Reeuwijk , in southwest Holland, said. \nThe light strip is just a pilot project at this stage. It was developed and installed by local company HIG Traffic Systems, which hopes to sell it to other municipalities. Three schools in the district are said to be excited about the project. \nAlderman Kees Oskam said pedestrians were distracted from paying attention to traffic by social media, games and music on their smartphones. \nAs a government, we probably can not easily reverse this trend, but we want to anticipate it,\" he said. \nDutch road safety organisation VVN said it did not think the new lighting would be a solution, Dutch News reported. \"What you are doing is rewarding bad behaviour,\" a spokesman said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:43:35.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
