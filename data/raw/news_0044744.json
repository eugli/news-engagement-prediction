(Alexandra Petri) \nMcMaster, born in 1962, earned a doctoral degree in history from the University of North Carolina. Outside the Army, he may be best known for his 1997 book, \"Dereliction of Duty: Lyndon Johnson , Robert McNamara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and the Lies that Led to Vietnam,\" a searing indictment of the U.S. government's mishandling of the Vietnam War. The book earned him a reputation for being willing to speak truth to power. \nHow closely McMaster's and Trump's views align were not clear. On Russia, McMaster appears to hold a much dimmer view than Trump of Moscow's military and political objectives in Europe. \nIn remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in May 2016, McMaster said Russia managed to annex Crimea and intervene militarily in eastern Ukraine \"at zero cost\" from the international community. \nMcMaster said Moscow's broader goal is to \"collapse the post-Cold War security, economic and political order in Europe and replace that order with something that is more sympathetic to Russian interests.\" \nIn his current role, McMaster has studied the way Russia developed and executed its campaigns in Crimea and Ukraine, where it used what some call \"hybrid warfare\" â€” part political, part disinformation, part military.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:16:21.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
