At the time, German Chancellor Angela Merkel hinted that Russia might be behind the attack. \nThe 29-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday at Luton airport in southern England by officers from the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) at the request of the German police, The Local reported. \n“The Briton stands accused of attempted computer sabotage in a particularly serious case,” German federal police and prosecutors said in a statement, adding that they will now seek the hacker’s extradition.

The example shows that the law can also be enforced in cyberspace,” Thomas Kremer, Deutsche Telekom Chairman for Legal Affairs and Compliance, stressed. \nREAD MORE: Berlin whistleblower behind German-NSA secret data leak, not Russian hackers – sources \nShortly after the attack, German Chancellor Angela Merkel hinted that it may well be masterminded by Moscow. \n“I have no indication as yet, no evidence as to the possible perpetrators of the attacks against [Deutsche] Telekom… I am just saying such cyber-attacks, or hybrid conflicts as they are known in Russian doctrine, are now part of daily life and we must learn to cope with them. Also, we have to inform people, and continue to express our political convictions clearly,” Merkel said. \nREAD MORE: German intel finds no proof of Russian ‘disinformation ops’ against Berlin – govt source \nThe statement coincided with claims by the head of Germany’s foreign intelligence service that the 2017 general election could be targeted by Russian hackers to undermine the democratic process. \nIn 2015, the hacking attack against Germany's lower house parliament was also blamed on Russia, with no proof ever being provided.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:49:22.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
