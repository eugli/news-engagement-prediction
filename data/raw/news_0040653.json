The world's most popular messaging app - WhatsApp - with millions of users in the UAE alone, has introduced new features in the past few months in order to keep up with competitors, such as Snapchat and Facebook Messenger. Here are some new features launched in the past few months. Two-step verification Two-step verification is a well-known security feature already available on many other services like Facebook, Twitter, Google and Dropbox, among others. Using a special code to verify that you're you , this extra verification step makes your accounts more secure. WhatsApp now offers this feature too. The app allows you to create a six-digit passcode that will be required each time your phone number is verified with the application. To enable the two-step verification feature: open WhatsApp and go to Settings > Account > Two-step verification, then tap Enable and set your code. Increased media sharing limit Whatsapp's past media sharing limit of 10 videos or photos is no longer a restriction on its users. Whatsapp now allows you to send a maximum of 30 videos or photos at a time to an individual chat or group conversation. Converting video to GIFs Whatsapp users can now convert videos into GIFs before sharing them. When you attach a video to a message, you can convert the video to a GIF by tapping the camcorder icon on the upper right hand corner of the video trimming page. The video will be sent as a GIF icon that can be up to six seconds long.

Once you receive a voice message, simply press the play button to listen. By default, it will come out through your speakerphone, but when you lift the phone to your ear - it will play through the receiver, like a normal phone call.
