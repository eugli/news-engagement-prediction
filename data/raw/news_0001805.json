Similar efforts have popped up at airports around the country. Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images Amid a series of embarrassing reports suggesting that John Kelly, among other top-ranking members of the White House, had been blindsided by President Donald Trump’s immigration ban, the secretary of Homeland Security held a press conference Tuesday to allay the impression of administrative ineptitude. Kelly and officials from Customs and Border Protection maintained that Trump’s executive order barring Syrian refugees and most travel from seven majority-Muslim countries was handled “professionally” and denied there were any major issues with order’s implementation, though Kelly granted that communication had been lacking. Department officials also offered a new set of figures that vastly expanded the White House estimate of the number of individuals affected by the ban, which has sparked dozens of mass protests across the country in the days since Trump signed the order Friday night. “I kept being asked about ‘chaos’ at the ports of entry,” Kelly said. “As I said to many, many members of Congress, our officers, who are at the counter, so to speak, the only chaos they saw was at other points of the airport.” At least 20 G.O.P. lawmakers, dozens of Democrats, and attorneys general from 15 states have criticized the travel ban, and 1,000 State Department employees signed a letter condemning the measure and its implementation. Kelly’s use of “chaos” likely referred to protests and ad-hoc legal-aid services set up in terminals throughout the country. But while the federal government was dogged by confusion and disarray , an advocacy movement grew organized and efficient at airports around the country. At Los Angeles’s L.A.X., Chicago’s O’Hare, and New York’s J.F.K., volunteer translators and lawyers worked around the clock. Similar efforts took shape Monday at San Francisco’s S.F.O. and Virginia’s Dulles airports. Iranian-Americans at LAX provided feedback for lawyers on how to re-write their signs, so as to avoid intimidating Iranian family members of detained individuals. At J.F.K., 24 hours’ worth of shifts were organized not just for immigration lawyers and translators, but also for communications and social-media experts. On Tuesday, a law firm picked up the tab at the Central Diner in J.F.K.’s Terminal 4, where technology-minded folks spoke of creating the simplest possible “tech stack” to assist the lawyers in their work. Signs advertising free legal help were written in English, Persian, and Arabic, and teams of lawyers and translators were dispatched according to the expected need at various terminals. “Throughout all of this, people who were entering our country were treated the way they’re always treated, with dignity and respect,” Kelly said on Tuesday. Dignity and respect, however, were likely not the words that have come to mind for the hundreds of people who have been caught up in the Trump administration’s immigration dragnet. On Friday, an Iraqi translator who worked alongside American troops and government agents for more than 10 years was detained overnight and handcuffed in New York before being released amid increased media glare and in-person pressure from multiple members of Congress. On Saturday, cameras captured the emotional reunion of an Iranian mother and her five-year-old son , who had been detained for hours at Dulles International Airport. Other visa and green-card holders were blocked from visiting sick relatives, prevented from attending school or returning to their jobs in America, The New York Times reported . Some were reportedly denied medical assistance or encouraged to sign away their rights to permanent residency. On Wednesday, a 16-year-old Jordanian visa holder entered his fourth day of detention by federal authorities. According to his family’s attorneys, Mohammad Abu Khadra, a Houston-area high-school student, had traveled home to renew his visa. When he landed on Friday, he was detained at George Bush Intercontinental Airport until Monday, at which point he was sent to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. His lawyers say no reason has been given for his detention. Jordan is not one of the seven countries restricted in the executive order. (A government source told the Hive Khadra’s detention is not related to the executive order. “Due to the Privacy Act, we cannot comment on specific cases,” a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said. We’ve also reached out to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.) “Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning,” Trump had tweeted on Saturday. On Tuesday, Kelly clarified: those numbers were accurate “early on,” but “of course, over time, that number will increase.” The agency said that, as of three P.M. on Monday, 721 individuals had been denied boarding, 1,059 legal permanent residents had been granted waivers, and 75 visa holders had been granted waivers. The agency did not provide information on how long those waivers took to be granted, or how long individuals were detained. Legal advocates around the country cited multiple cases of individuals being held for more than 24 hours—some of whom were handcuffed. Around 11:30 P.M on Tuesday., a visibly angry white man ambled up to a team of volunteer attorneys and translators at J.F.K.’s Terminal 1. “O.K., I want free legal help,” he said, yelling. “I’m here, and now I want free legal help. Because I’m a taxpayer. So advise me.” When the attorneys explained they were offering legal services to those detained under the executive order, but were nonetheless happy to assist him, too, he said that he was “detained for 15 minutes,” and asked if the lawyers were “only willing to help people from those other countries.” “You know what? You’re all a bunch of bleeding hearts,” the man continued. “Go change your diapers!” Seemingly satisfied with his own performance, he wheeled his carry-on luggage out of the terminal. And so another day passed in Trump’s America: confusion at the White House and Department of Homeland Security, grown men rendered spitting mad by a “Free Legal Help” sign, and dozens of refugees, immigrants, and dedicated volunteers stuck in between, fighting to make sense of it all. Correction: An earlier version of this story recounted the story of Mike Hager, a U.S. citizen of Iraqi origin who said his ailing 75-year-old mother, a green-card holder, had died after being prevented from boarding a flight from Iraq to the U.S. An imam of a mosque in Dearborn, Michigan, confirmed Wednesday that the women died before the ban was put in place.
