It was quickly pointed out that no such incident ever took place and she corrected herself on Twitter, saying that she meant to refer to \"Bowling Green terrorists.\" (In 2009, two Iraqi refugees living in Bowling Green admitted to attempting to sponsor terrorist activity.)\nOn Sunday, New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg reported that the White House declined to make Vice President Mike Pence available to CNN for a Sunday interview, but offered Conway in his stead.\nCNN turned Conway down, Rutenberg wrote, citing \"serious questions about her credibility.\" A CNN source confirmed that account of events to the Washington Examiner .\n\"Kellyanne is not a substitute for the vice president,\" said the source. \"That's why 'State of the Union' declined. And more broadly, credibility issues. Although I'd expect to see her on at some point.\"\nConway disputed that version of the story.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Congratulations, Internet.

CNN brass on those emails.\"\nCNN's public relations Twitter account shot back and said that Conway \"was offered to 'State of the Union' on Sunday by the White House. We passed. Those are the facts.\"\nA spokesperson for CNN declined to comment on that, and Conway did not respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner .\nConway is one of President Trump 's closest advisers and a regular fixture on cable news programs.\nThe \"Bowling Green massacre\" controversy wasn't the first time she made headlines. In January, she used the phrase \"alternative facts\" to rebut critics who said Trump lied about the size of his Inauguration Day audience in Washington.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Legal group behind Friedrichs Supreme Court case to make another try It challenges California's requirement that the educators must belong to support the union.\nBy Sean Higgins • 02/06/17 6:12 PM Top Story Secret Service spouses circulate   agent's firing Kerry O'Grady \"has lost all credibility,\" Secret Service spouses told the Washington Examiner.\nBy Susan Crabtree • 02/06/17 2:19 PM Share  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:30:37.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
