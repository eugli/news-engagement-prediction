There is plenty of good news. First and foremost, of course, is that Reyes, the No. 14 overall prospect , is plenty young enough to come back from Tommy John surgery and be the dominant starter all envisioned. But beyond that is the fact the Cardinals have a lot of talent filling in behind him. \nThere's the best catching prospect in the game in Carson Kelly , who should be more than ready to be the starter in 2018 should the organization choose not to bring back Yadier Molina . Harrison Bader and Paul DeJong, two college bats from the 2015 Draft, had very strong first full seasons and could help out sooner rather than later. \nAnd there is a whole lot of exciting, albeit raw, talent farther away. Starting with 2016 first-rounder Delvin Perez and continuing down to a host of players courtesy of the Cardinals' international spending spree last July, the majority of players in the Top 30 -- 17 to be precise -- have ETAs of 2019 or beyond. If that cadre of young players' tools start showing up in performance, this could easily be a Top 10 farm system in 2018 and the years to come. \nBiggest jump/fall Here are the players whose ranks changed the most from the 2016 preseason list to the 2017 preseason list. \nJump: Eliezer Alvarez , 2B (2016: NR | 2017: 12) Fall: Nick Plummer, OF (2016: 6 | 2017: 23) \nBest tools Players are graded on a 20-80 scouting scale for future tools -- 20-30 is well below average, 40 is below average, 50 is average, 60 is above average and 70-80 is well above average. \nHit: Eliezer Alvarez (55)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:56:24.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
