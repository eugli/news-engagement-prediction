The delay of the Galaxy S8 allows Samsung to focus on a different product: the Galaxy Tab series.There have been quite a few rumors about the upcoming unveil of the Galaxy Tab S3 tablet, which makes today's Samsung teaser unsurprising for many.Although Samsung hasn't yet confirmed which of its products will be the star of the MWC 2017, the latest teaser definitely points to the Galaxy Tab S3 tablet.The tablet recently received FCC's approval , so it makes perfect sense to make appearance next month at the exhibition. We've also had our fair share of specs leaks, but it remains unclear whether or not Samsung will launch different variants based on the chipset inside.As some of you probably know, the Galaxy Tab S3 is said to pack Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 processor inside, but another report claims the slate will include Samsung's own Exynos 7420 chipset.Other highlights of the slate include 9.7-inch display, 4GB RAM, fingerprint sensor in the front, as well as USB Type-C port and Android 7.0 Nougat on board. If what we believe proves to be accurate, then Samsung will announce the Galaxy Tab S3 at MWC 2017, on February 26.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:18:23.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
