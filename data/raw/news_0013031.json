(AP Photo/Eric Gay) \nTom Brady threw for a Super Bowl record 466 yards and two touchdowns en route to winning his fourth Super Bowl MVP award as he led the New England Patriots back from a 28-3 second-half deficit to defeat the Atlanta Falcons, 34-28 in Super Bowl 51 Sunday night in Houston. \nThe Patriots scored 19 points in the final quarter, including a pair of 2-point conversions, before James White's 2-yard touchdown run on the first possession of overtime clinched the franchise's fifth NFL championship.\n\nBrady, the first quarterback to win five Super Bowl rings and the first to win four Super Bowl MVPs, guided the Patriots (17-2) through a tiring Atlanta defense for fourth-quarter touchdowns on a 6-yard pass to Danny Amendola and a 1-yard run by White, which came with 57 seconds remaining in regulation. White ran for the first 2-pointer and Amendola did the deed with a reception on the second.\n\nBrady also threw 62 times, setting a record for the most passing attempts in Super Bowl history. \n\n\"You know, we all brought each other back,\" Brady said. \"We never felt out of it. It was a tough battle. They have a great team. I give them a lot of credit. We just made a few more plays than them.\"\n\nBefore the stunning rally -- New England already held the biggest comeback in the final period when it turned around a 10-point deficit to beat Seattle two years ago -- the Falcons (13-6) appeared poised to take their first NFL championship in 51 seasons. Having never been in such a pressurized environment, their previously staunch pass rush disappeared, and Brady tore them apart.\n\n\"Deflategate\" far behind them, Brady and coach Bill Belichick won their 25th postseason game, by far a record. It's hard to imagine a tenser victory.\n\nBelichick became the first coach with five Super Bowl crowns.\n\nThe Patriots won the coin toss for overtime and it was no contest. Brady completed six passes. A pass interference call took the ball to the 2, and White scooted to his right and barely over the goal line.\n\nHis teammates streamed off the sideline to engulf White as confetti streamed down from the NRG Stadium rafters.\n\nIt was almost an impossible dream for the Patriots a bit earlier. But helped by Matt Ryan's fumble on a sack, a spectacular catch by Julian Edelman , and Brady's passing, they never stopped coming.\n\nWhite had 14 receptions for 110 yards as the key weapon, but Brady hit seven different receivers.\nUntil the Patriots took charge with their late surge, league MVP Ryan was outplaying Brady. It didn't last.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:24:42.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
