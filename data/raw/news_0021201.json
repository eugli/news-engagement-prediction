(Photo: Reinhold Matay, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nFlorida coach Michael White has never reached the NCAA tournament with any team he's coached, though he sure knows how to get teams close. At Louisiana Tech, he guided the Bulldogs to three consecutive seasons of 27 wins or more. And last year, Florida was one of the first teams out on the bubble in his first season at the helm. \nSuffice it to say, the Gators (19-5, 9-2) are going dancing in 2017. They sport a top-10 RPI, a top-five non-conference strength of schedule that included their first 11 games away from home, and four of their five losses have come against top 25 teams. \nA few weeks back, the only thing missing on the Gators' résumé was a signature win to serve as eye candy for the selection committee. They got that in the form of a 22-point drubbing of Kentucky last Saturday to take command of the SEC. That was followed by a 12-point road win at Georgia on Tuesday night. Even with the Billy Donovan era long gone, Florida is still Florida. And that means as a contender. If we're searching for Final Four darkhorse teams here in early February, this squad should be at the top of the list. \n► No. 1 seeds: Villanova, Gonzaga, Kansas, Baylor \n► Last four in: California, Kansas State, Marquette, Rhode Island \n► First four out: Michigan, Clemson, Wake Forest, Vanderbilt \nMoving in : Rhode Island \nMoving out : Clemson \n► Others considered for at-large bids (in no particular order): Illinois, Penn State, Pittsburgh, Providence, Nebraska, Stanford, Wichita State, Texas A&M, Houston, Memphis, Ohio State, Iowa, Ole Miss, Auburn, Alabama, Arkansas, Texas Tech, Miami, Charleston, Temple, Georgia, Utah, North Carolina State, Georgetown \n► No longer considered: UConn, Texas, Texas-Arlington, Charleston, New Mexico, Boise State, LaSalle, Davidson, Chattanooga, Saint Bonaventure, Saint Joseph's, BYU, Oklahoma \n► Multi-bid conferences: ACC (9), Big Ten (7), Big 12 (7), Big East (6), Pac-12 (5), SEC (4), A-10 (3), AAC (2), WCC (2). \nMORE HOOPS NEWS College basketball's cathedral, the Palestra, celebrates 90 years Conference Leaders \n► Or highest RPI from projected one-bid conferences - (23 total): Vermont (America East), Florida Gulf Coast (Atlantic Sun), Weber State (Big Sky), Winthrop (Big South), UC Davis (Big West), UNC-Wilmington (CAA), Middle Tennessee State (Conference USA), Valparaiso (Horizon), Yale (Ivy League), Monmouth (MAAC), Akron (MAC), N.C.
