Banning men from approaching women isn't the answer to our sexual harassment problem \nBut not 28-year-old Sofian Loho Dandel. \nWhen the garage mechanic from Indonesia received a call from Martha Potu, a stranger at the time, he fell for her voice so hard that the call ended up lasting for nearly an hour. \nThe pair continued to talk, not knowing much about each other – and, having completely fallen in love with Martha’s voice, Sofian decided to meet her. \nBut after reaching her house, he could not believe who answered the door – an 82-year-old widow. \nSofian had had no idea that he’d been speaking to a woman 54 years his senior. \nBut, while Sofian was shocked that Marthe hadn’t disclosed her age over the phone, he had, after all, expressed his love for her already – and his feelings remained unchanged. (Picture: Caters News) \nSofian decided to continue with his visit and stayed with Martha for two hours – where they chatted about everything that came to their minds. \nIn that time Sofian learned that Martha had been living alone since the death of her husband ten years ago, and had two children who had left the country to work abroad. \nMoved by her story, Sofian, who had never dated before, promised to stay with her forever. \nAnd he truly meant those words – as Sofian went on to ask for her hand in marriage, receiving a resounding ‘yes’ from Martha. \nThe pair tied the knot on 18 February this year, exchanging vows in presence of their family and loved ones in North Sulawesi, Indonesia.
