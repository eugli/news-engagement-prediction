The opening Grand Prix of 2017 may still be a month away, but this week we get to see this year’s cars driven in anger for the first time - and already we know they are lower, wider, faster and noisier! \nThis page - updated throughout the day, with newest posts at the top - brings you the key news and information from the first test session of the year at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya... RECAP First of two, four-day pre-season tests (Feb 27-Mar 2 and Mar 7-10) Track running each day from 0900-1300, 1400-1800 local time (GMT+1) Each team can run one car Ricciardo brings out early red flag, McLaren also have issues Lap times already quicker than first day in 2016 \nHaas investigates... Still looking into @KevinMagnussen 's stoppage. The Dane still to set a lap time in anger this morning. #F1Testing — Haas F1 Team (@HaasF1Team) February 27, 2017 \nHaas only officially rolled their 2017 car out this morning - and it hasn't exactly gone to plan. New recruit Kevin Magnussen managed seven installation laps before hitting issues at the pit entry - and he hasn't been back out since. Alonso and McLaren (below) are the only others yet to set a time so far on the opening morning. \nEarly issues for McLaren \nFernando Alonso’s vibrant McLaren looked resplendent in the Barcelona sunshine as it headed out this morning, but the Honda-powered machine has since been confined to the garage with an apparent oil system issue. \nOff to a flyer \nThe quickest time on day one of last year's opening pre-season test? Sebastian Vettel's 1m 24.939s. The quickest time after two hours of this year's first test? 1m 23.370s for Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas... \n2017's heavily revised cars already looking mighty quick then. To watch a video explaining the technical changes that have slashed lap times, click here . \nUnlucky for some? \nRed Bull have been using the hashtag #breaksuperstition in reference to their new car, the RB13. However, rather ominously, Daniel Ricciardo became the first driver to bring out the red flags this year when he brought his machine to a standstill after four laps with a sensor issue.

For minute-by-minute timesheet updates, download the Official F1® App and go to Results & Standings > TEST. For more information, click here . \nAnd they’re off! \nRenault’s Nico Hulkenberg (above) was the first driver out of the pit lane this morning, and there’s been a steady stream of cars on track ever since.
