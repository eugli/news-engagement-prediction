The company attempted to shake things up with the bold designs of its G5 and V20 handsets, but its gamble didn't pay off as both models failed to entice the mass consumer and sold poorly. As a result, the South Korean firm has reportedly changed tactics and is likely to adopt a more traditional approach in 2017. The LG G6 will have its premiere at MWC which is just around the corner, so we do have a considerable amount of information about the device. One of the biggest let downs of the upcoming flagship is that it most probably won't sport the latest high-end SoC from Qualcomm, as Samsung has effectively hoarded first batch of the Snapdragon 835 for its Galaxy S8. The G6 will have to make do with the Snapdragon 821, which might be a big disappointment for some fans of the brand. However, LG might actually redeem itself with the release of the V30 handset in H2 2017. The latest speculations from China's Weibo suggest that the V30 will indeed host the Snapdragon 835, while also boasting 6 GB of RAM and a truly unique camera setup that will have two sets of dual cameras at the front and back. A bunch of other \"mysterious\" features were also mentioned, although nothing more was specified. As with all other rumors, we suggest that you take this information with a pinch of salt. More details are bound to come in as we go through the next months, so stay tuned and we'll do our best to keep you updated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T20:33:49.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
