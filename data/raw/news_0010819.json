Article continues below \nThe Reds are out of both cup competitions and following yesterday's shock defeat to Hull, they are now 13 points behind Chelsea at the top of the Premier League. \nFor the first time since he took charge at Anfield, the faith of the club supporters in Jurgen Klopp is being put to the test. Article continues below Marcelo abused for not wishing Cristiano happy birthday - reacts brilliantly \nAnd former Liverpool favourite Dietmar Hamann has voiced his own concerns about the manager. \nLast summer, the club's hierarchy were so impressed by the changes Klopp had made during his first season they offered the German a six-year contract extension - a decision Hamann has labelled 'absolute madness'. \n\"I like Klopp, but you know they lost two finals, so I'd be careful. I wouldn't have given him a six-year contract. I think that's absolute madness,\" Hamann told The Times . \n\"He's got six years left now. They lost to Southampton (in the League Cup semi-final) so that's another year gone (without a trophy). They may not finish top four.\" \nAfter such a bad start to 2017, Klopp's men have fallen from title contenders to top four hopefuls with both Manchester clubs now breathing down their necks for that last Champions League qualifying spot. \nHamann believes the team's current slump might be connected to their lack of experience which became even more obvious during the 1-1 draw with Chelsea earlier this week. \nHe added: \"When I watched them the other day against Chelsea, to me it looked like a team with purpose, a bunch of men - against boys who like to play. \n\"Chelsea were the grown-up team. This is where Liverpool need to improve. They need some game intelligence, some nous, and if they don't develop that they need to bring someone in.\" \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
