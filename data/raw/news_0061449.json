Others are less sure. By Ariel Edwards-Levy \nAmericans are divided in how much they think Donald Trump has accomplished in the first weeks of his presidency, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds , even as a plurality say they think he’s moved quickly to make changes in policy. \nForty-three percent say he’s accomplished a good amount or a great deal since taking office, and another 43 percent say he’s accomplished not very much, or that he’s accomplished little or nothing. \nBy a 7-point margin, 36 percent to 29 percent, Americans say Trump has achieved more than former President Barack Obama had at this point in his presidency . \nA 46 percent plurality say Trump has made policy changes too quickly since becoming president, while 30 percent say he’s been moving at the right speed, and 10 percent that he hasn’t been moving quickly enough. \nMost Americans who voted for Trump in last year’s election are happy with how much he’s done so far. A 62 percent majority of Trump voters say he’s made policy changes at about the right speed, with 15 percent saying he’s moved too fast and 19 percent that he hasn’t moved quickly enough. Eighty-seven percent believe he’s achieved a good amount or a great deal since taking office. Just over half say Trump has accomplished more than they expected him to at this point, while another 39 percent see him as having achieved about as much as they expected. \nIn contrast, 84 percent of voters who supported Hillary Clinton say that Trump has moved too quickly to institute policy changes. A t the same time, 80 percent say he’s achieved not very much, or little to nothing. \nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 16-17 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. \nThe Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here . More details on the polls’ methodology are available here . \nMost surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov’s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample, rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error.
