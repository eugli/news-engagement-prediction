(The \"carrot discount\" is where customers scan expensive produce, like cherries, as if it is something much cheaper, like carrots.) \nWith research showing that up to one-third of shoppers serve themselves a discount when scanning their own goods, especially fruit and vegetables, Coles has even called in the NSW Police, who in October said they will charge people for theft over \"discount\" amounts as small as $2. SHARE Pin to Pinterest PIN Link What did Coles expect? While they may claim that self-serve checkouts are more convenient for customers, the real point of them is to boost the company's profitability by cutting their wage bill. Part of doing that is shifting work back onto the customer. \nWhat did Coles expect? While they may claim that self-serve checkouts are more convenient for customers, the real point of them is to boost the company's profitability by cutting their wage bill. Part of doing that is shifting work back onto the customer. \nSelf-serve checkouts are only the latest move in what is basic supermarket strategy: squeeze the producer, squeeze the workforce and squeeze the consumer, who, despite the friendly TV jingles, is just a conduit for funds transfer between bank accounts anyway. SHARE Coles has been working hard to crack down on self-service checkout theft. Photo: Louie Douvis \nWhy are all the goods on shelves in open aisles? So you, the customer, can do the work of gathering the groceries that a grocery store clerk used to do. \nElectronic payments rather than cash? Now you're doing their banking for them. Self-service checkouts? You're scanning and packing your own shopping, a job that used to be done by two people. Advertisement \nColes might think they have a shoplifting problem, but really they have a customer service problem: customer service is cut in the pursuit of corporate profits, and customers aren't happy. No wonder many shoppers view them as a faceless food factory that it's OK to rip off: that's what they're making themselves into by taking away the faces at the checkouts. \nThis is not a defence of theft, of course, nor an incitement to steal. But Coles might want to take a lesson from the public transport experience in Melbourne. We didn't have much of a problem with fare evasion in the days when conductors sold tickets on trams. Once Myki came in and conductors went out (in what was nothing more than a cost-cutting and union-busting exercise by transport managers), fare evasion took off. \nPTV has had to deploy goon squads of inspectors to heavy fare evaders with excessive fines, creating an adversarial relationship with many of their customers: Very Bad Business Practice. Coles, by calling in the cops, might be headed down the same path, treating their customers like criminals and creating a similarly dysfunctional relationship. And they might want to think about what it means in New South Wales to charge someone with theft for pinching a loaf of bread. \nMatt Holden is a Fairfax Media columnist.
