According to reports, Akshay has already begun prepping for ‘Gold’, which revolves around India’s first Olympic medal win as a free nation in the year 1948 at the 14th Olympiad in London. The actor will be essaying the role of Balbir Singh, who was a member of the three-time Olympic-winning Indian hockey team.

Sunny Kaushal, who plays the second lead in the Reema Kagti-directed film, too joins him for the training. While ‘Gold’ is slated to hit theatres on August 15, 2018, Akshay has several releases lined up this year – ‘Toilet: Ek Prem Katha’, ‘2.0’ and ‘PadMan’.
