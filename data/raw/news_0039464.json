The majestic Manny Pacquiao, winner of world titles in a record-breaking eight different divisions. Freddie Roach, the legendary trainer, who has helped shape the careers of Pacquiao, Amir Khan and countless others. Mike Tyson, wearing a Scotland football shirt...\nLewis Benson is there, too, yet his status in the sport is currently being moulded within the confines of the Lochend Boxing Club in Edinburgh, under the tutelage of Terry McCormack.\nThe young Scot has dreams, though. And a jab that has kept him out of trouble in and out of the ring. He is one of a batch of Glasgow 2014 fighters currently making their way in the sport after turning pro in the wake of the Commonwealth Games. It won’t be an easy journey. And Benson knows this. In truth, there is no escaping the risk and reward nature of the sport. Reality has hit Scottish boxing hard of late.\nLewis Benson remains undefeated since turning professional and is working his way up\nBenson remains in the dressing room but the crowd have already taken their seats, waiting anxiously for the action to begin ahead of another fight night.\nBut first, the ringside bell tolls, 10 times in total. It is the last count of Mike Towell, a tribute paid less than 24 hours after his death.\nBenson will step out at Bellahouston Sports Centre, just a few miles from Glasgow city centre and the hotel in which Towell went down two nights earlier, on September 29 last year, never to recover.\nThe announcer reminds the crowd of ‘the hardest game’ these young men before them play, before giving his own tribute to Towell in front of the live TV cameras.\nAnd then they move on.\nFor Benson, it was impossible not to think about his fallen countryman. But he knew what he had to do when he stepped in to the ring. Box smart. Use his jab. Stay out of trouble.\n‘I had to try to put it to the back of my mind but it didn’t really work,’ says Benson a few weeks later, now back inside the Lochend gym he calls home. His right hand is bandaged up, an injury which will eventually keep him from fighting for the rest of 2016, but he is still working out, maintaining his fitness, trying to keep his momentum.\n‘I was lying in bed the morning of the fight thinking about it. It just shows you how serious this sport is.\n‘I just said to myself that day: “I’m going to be so smart. I’m not going to take too many shots. I’m going to move around and show that there is an art behind boxing”.\nWhat happened to Mike was tragic. I don't really know what else to say about it ‘I don’t want to be in these wars — that can’t be good for anyone getting hit like that. There’s so many fighters that have wars.\n‘Obviously, what happened to Mike was tragic. I don’t really know what else to say about it.’\nBack to the fight in Glasgow and his opponent, Polish journeyman Lukasz Janik, seems in the mood for a war. Head down, charge is the 28-year-old pitbull’s mantra. But still, he can’t get close enough to Benson over the six rounds.\n‘Before, I would let them in and have a wee fight with them but now I need to use the head,’ continues the 25-year-old. ‘Boxing is a hard enough sport, never mind taking all these shots.\n‘What’s worked with me, I’m going to keep doing. I’m out there to show the art of boxing.’\nAnd so he secures his seventh straight victory, this time on points, since turning professional back in August 2015.\nBenson represented his country at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow back in 2014\nBenson (centre right) turned professional just a year after the Commonwealth Games\nThere’s a reason why a boxer first picks up the gloves, why they feel the urge to step into the ring knowing the inherent risks such a move entails.\nFor Benson, his journey to the professional arena began at school. It was no easy path. Brawls in the playground were followed by verbal jousts in the classroom.\nDealing with his own internal demons was hard enough. Having people attack him simply for the colour of his skin would, however, break almost anyone.\n‘I was always a really angry kid,’ admits Benson. ‘I’ve come from a small place in Clermiston, in Edinburgh, and been the only mixed-race guy in there.\n‘When I was younger, if someone insulted me, I wouldn’t hesitate in punching them in the face.’\nThere’s no pointing of fingers from Benson, no excuses. But it is clear that he found little solace from authority in his youth.\nHe continues: ‘None of my teachers really knew that I was boxing but there’s one story that I’ll never forget from my school days.\n‘I was in German class and my teacher was questioning me on what I wanted to do, because I wasn’t showing any interest in learning German!\n‘I said: “I’m going to be a professional boxer — and you’re going to watch me on TV”. She just laughed at me and said: “No, you won’t”. Everyone else in the class laughed. It has always stuck in my head. I’ll never forget that.’\nChannelling both that aggression and frustration into boxing, Benson finally found an outlet. He learned to deal with what was going on outside by stepping in the ring.\nHis family were also right behind him. His Scottish mother Angie knew how to keep him in check. While his Nigerian father Bobby, a bricklayer by trade, even remortgaged the house to help support his training in the build-up to the Commonwealth Games in 2014.\nNow, he is determined to continue that progression.\nIt has been a tough road for Benson, who even suffered racist abuse when growing up\n‘When I was 12, I went to the boxing gym for the first time and I fell in love with the sport,’ he says. ‘My mum used to say to me that if I didn’t behave I wouldn’t be allowed to go.\n‘As I said, I was a very angry kid. But now I’m older and anyone could call me anything — I know it’s a part of life.\n‘Boxing has given me that maturity and that discipline to be able to handle that. These people (who abused me) are below me.\n‘When I was younger, it was harder. Now I’m older, it’s good to look back and know that I’ve come through all of that and am on the other side. Now I look where I am and look where I’m going.\n‘People doubted me when I was growing up. I just want to prove that you can do what you want to do.\n‘All it takes is a bit of hard work and dedication. I use the doubt as motivation.’\nBenson is making his way up the rankings with the help of Lochend BC and Watermans\nThe pictures hanging on the wall at Lochend Boxing Club are there for a reason. McCormack, Benson’s highly-rated trainer and founder of the gym, counts Roach as both a friend and a fan.\nOn more than one occasion, the Scot has been asked to join Roach in America to work. So far he has resisted that temptation, but he did take advantage of their friendship to take a group of his young boxers over to the legendary Wildcard Gym in Los Angeles five years ago.\nAnd while there, Benson picked up more than just invaluable experience...\n‘We went to the Wildcard in Los Angeles back in 2012 — me and the whole team from Lochend,’ he says. ‘I sparred in the main gym in the Wildcard four times. The whole gym stops and watches you.\n‘I sparred with someone who is now world interim champion — I did brilliantly against these guys.\n‘And when I came back from the Wildcard, I had no fear. I could jump in the ring with anybody. I’ve been in with the best.\n‘That’s where I got my name from, Kid Caramel, from the Wildcard boxing gym. There’s a boxer named Peter Quillin, a former world champion, whose name is Kid Chocolate. So after training one day he was giving us some advice, and he said: “You can be in my gang — you can be Kid Caramel”. It certainly means something to me, coming from a world champion.’\nSo where does Kid Caramel go from here? Well, he’s certainly in the right place, with McCormack having helped shape the careers of the likes of Alex Arthur and Josh Taylor.\nHe has five professionals under his tutelage at the moment and Benson insists that the state of Scottish boxing has never looked so promising.\nJosh Taylor is another who started off at Lochend - and he won gold at the Commonwealths\nTaylor is now managed by Barry McGuigan and is tipped to become a major star in the future\nRicky Burns continues to defy expectations and the class of Glasgow 2014 — Taylor, Benson, Charlie Flynn et al — continue to rack up the victories.\n‘I think it’s the best it’s ever been,’ enthuses Benson. ‘We had five televised boxing shows in the space of just one month in 2016. That just shows how much Scottish boxing is booming right now.\n‘I think it’s the best crop of boys we’ve had in a while. The Commonwealth Games lads, Kieran Smith, Joe Ham, Charlie Flynn, Josh Taylor, they are all flying. We’re nearly there. We’ll all probably be fighting for big titles soon. I might fight for a minor title first — Scottish, Celtic, something like that. I’ll be ready to compete at that level. I’m ready now, in fact.\n‘But when I compete at that level, I want to win — I want there to be no chance in hell of me being beaten. I would say, at the end of 2017, I’ll be knocking on the door for major titles.\n‘I’m working hard every day to get to that level. I’m under 12 months away from getting a massive fight and winning it.\nI'm ready to take risks. It's a waiting game and I am building myself up. But I am ready to take the step up ‘If my coach told me now to step up and fight one of these guys now, I’d be ready because he said I’d be ready.\n‘I want to fight someone of a sufficient calibre that would make people step up and take notice.\n‘It’s hard to get opponents like that, though. Other up-and-coming prospects don’t fancy it against me. People don’t want to lose their unbeaten record.\n‘I’m ready to take risks. It’s a waiting game and I am building myself up — I’m ready.’\nBut for Benson, it’s not just about winning. Not after what he’s been through. There’s an example to set to kids who may be just like he was growing up.\n‘I’ve had a lot of messages from kids, coming to watch me, coming to get pictures with me,’ he says. ‘I mean, I’ve not done anything — I’m just at the start of my career — but it means a lot to have these kids looking up to me.\n‘I want to show young kids a different road. There’s a sport out there for everyone and it doesn’t have to be boxing.\n‘Sport has changed my life — it can have that effect.’\nLewis Benson is sponsored by Watermans accident claims and care.
