The four dancers seen at the Walker are now among New York’s busiest downtown performers, appearing in work by other choreographers. Their exposure to Cunningham’s choreography since 2011 has been limited. Yet all four have matured as Cunningham exponents. It even looked as if his company had never closed — as if his work remained central to their artistic activity.

Credit Jenn Ackerman for The New York Times Although a central tenet of Cunningham choreography is that it exists independently of its music, all Cunningham dancers speak of its musicality. Here this predominated. The quietly elegant Ms. Scott, in a solo, maintained prodigies of balance on one leg while keeping her raised leg and other body parts in legato motion. There were elements of staccato (a cutting-off finish) and marcato (sharp attack in entry) within her overall flow of movement. This was musicianly virtuosity, like the cadenza of a master violinist spinning out gleaming tone. Part of the fun of most Cunningham Events is that they cover a gamut. Sure enough, dynamics, rhythms, speeds, geometries, directions and vocabularies kept changing at the Walker. The dancers sat still, skittered backward on their heels, performed marvels of adagio control, slapped the floor and sprang up from it in jumps. The Wednesday Event was in a room containing paintings by the Cunningham collaborators Rauschenberg and Mr. Johns. It was easy to feel the dancing’s kinship of spirit. Rauschenberg’s work calmly includes an eclectic range of subject matter; Mr. Johns’s gives focused, painterly attention to color and line within familiar subjects. The dancing’s purity and fastidious stylishness was Johnsian; its generous, cool range of mood was like Rauschenberg. A solo by Ms. Toogood also reflected the formal drama with which New York’s Abstract Expressionist painters of the 1940s and ’50s addressed allover space and aspects of line. Before Rauschenberg and Mr. Johns were on the scene, Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline were among Cunningham’s admirers. Photo Jamie Scott, left, and Ms. Toogood at the Walker Art Center. Credit Jenn Ackerman for The New York Times Mr. Toogood’s dancing — forthright, clean, devout in manner — opened up beams, arcs, paths in space with her arms, legs and spine. This was not a drama representing something else; this was dance showing the drama of sheer motion. At times this dancing was like one of Alexander Calder’s mobiles, with various levels of the body moving separately and together. Cunningham dance theater can seem to be at its purest in Event form. Audiences aren’t told which dance is which; you just let the dance take you along its shifting paths. At the Walker, where audiences were on three sides of the space, live musicians — singer and double bass — delivered wonderfully weird displays, ranging from jazz coloratura to rasping edginess, ideally heightening the suspenseful atmosphere. Cunningham devotees also crave the works he composed as theatrical repertory, each accompanied by its own score and designs. Last week the Ballet de Lorraine brought one of the most sensational of these, “Sounddance” (1975), to the Joyce Theater in New York. (The company next takes it — along with Cunningham’s 1987 “Fabrications” — to Minneapolis and Chicago.) The way designs, music and choreography meet to create atmospheric intensity is a perfect example of why Cunningham dance theater has often seemed Diaghilevian, even though David Tudor (composer), Mark Lancaster (designer) and Cunningham knew next to nothing of what the others were planning. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The title comes from a line from James Joyce: “In the beginning was the woid, in the muddle is the sound-dance, and thereinofter you’re in the unbewised again.” Sometimes Cunningham resisted the idea that a work should have a beginning, a middle and an end — but not so here. The choreography gives us a sense of the void, of time being intensely limited, of life having a start, a conclusion, and a desperate, passionate rush in between. It looks biological, sexual and violent. Though the Lorraine dancers did not have all the rigor of the Cunningham company, this was recognizably “Sounddance” — ardent, violent, thrilling. \nMerce Cunningham: Common Time Through July 30 at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; walkerart.org .
