While the photo of Schultz was up on screen, plume of cold breath on display, Fallon wrote a thank you note to cold weather, \"for making it look like like I'm constantly vaping.\"\nSchultz, who says he does not vape, didn't see the episode when it debuted but his buddies on social media were quick to let him know about the unexpected air time.\n\"I think some of my friends on Facebook have already made that joke that, I'm the next Dick Assman, which is pretty hilarious,\" said Schultz.\nARCHIVE: Wendy Mesley profile of Dick Assman from 1995 The photo is from six years ago when Schultz and a friend were taking photos. He thinks his friend, who worked for a photography company at the time, put the photo online in a stock image database.\nThe Pistolwhips, a Saskatoon based indie rock band. (From Facebook)\nSchultz has since filmed a response for Fallon.\n\"We decided to make a little response video to Jimmy Fallon to maybe, hopefully, prompt him to get the band, get my band The Pistolwhips, on the show,\" said Schultz.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fthepistolwhips%2Fvideos%2F1271173602937146%2F&width=450&show_text=false&height=252&appId", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/E85UT2SnlPc?t=3m14s"], "published": "2017-02-20T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:23:43.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
