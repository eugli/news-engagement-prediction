I want to continue the recovery work the council has done.” \nSome residents, led by Martin Luther King Jr. Center chairman James Hodge, accused the council of being influenced by party politics and the Nassau County Democratic Party. He alleged that some council members were promised deals for their votes. \n“No deals were made,” Eramo said. “The council was elected to make tough decisions, and this is one of them.” \nMoore said she was voting for Diamond to move the city forward.

At one point Hodge commandeered the microphone and shouted over the council that he was ready to go to jail unless everyone was allowed to speak. \nSome residents objected that the council chose Diamond over another candidate, Marvin McMoore, 23, who works as an aide to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. \nHodge and others also questioned Diamond’s residency, citing campaign disclosure forms that showed she made donations from her family’s address in Woodmere. \nDiamond said she wrote a check from an old bank account and has updated her records. She said she has lived at the same Long Beach apartment since 2009. \n  \nCity attorneys vetted her residency requirements that she lived in the city for at least two years.
