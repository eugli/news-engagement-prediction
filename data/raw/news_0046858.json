Share Rachel Moden left 60 bags of stinking rubbish in the yard of her home in Moorfield Grove, Tonge. (Photo: Bolton Council) Share   Thank you for subscribing!   \nA woman who left more than 60 bags of stinking rubbish to rot in her own back garden for months has been fined hundreds of pounds. \nRachel Moden ignored repeated requests from Bolton council to get rid of the bin bags, which were attracting flies and emitting a strong smell in the backyard of her rented property in Moorfield Grove, Tonge. \nThe 25-year-old was prosecuted by the council’s Housing Standards team following complaints by disgusted neighbours. \nShe was first asked in June last year to remove the rubbish, but when inspectors returned a month later it was still there. \nModen was served with official notices requesting it be disposed of, but she failed to clear it up. By August, it had still not been moved and the council stepped in to remove it. \nModen failed to attend Bolton Magistrates Court last week to answer to the charges and the matter was proved in her absence.

She must also pay court costs of £266 and a £44 surcharge. \nA further £514.22, which is how much it cost the council to get rid of the rubbish bags, will also be recovered from Moden. \nBolton council’s cabinet member for housing, Coun Elaine Sherrington, said: \"There is simply no excuse for dumping rubbish in this way and these cases show how the actions of one or two residents can affect an entire community.\" Carmen Baker dumped rubbish, including a sofa bed, outside her house in Brandwood Street, Rumworth, Bolton. (Photo: Bolton Council) \nCarmen Baker, of Brandwood Street, Rumworth has also been fined as part of Bolton Council’s ongoing crackdown on rubbish and fly-tipping. \nThe 45-year-old dumped several bags of rubbish, carpet oddments, furnishings, and a sofa bed in the rear yard of her rented house. She too ignored several warnings and the council ended up removing the rubbish itself. \nBaker was fined £440, in her absence, and ordered to pay court costs of £245 and a victim surcharge of £44. Clean up costs will be recovered from Baker as well.

We have also contacted the landlords of these properties to make them aware of the issues. \n“We are grateful to the public for being vigilant and reporting these cases to us. We will prosecute when requests and warnings are ignored.” \nComplaints about waste on private land, including properties, should be referred to the council’s Housing Standards team on 01204 336500.
