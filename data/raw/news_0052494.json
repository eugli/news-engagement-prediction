The move freed up a little bit of cap space, but ultimately appears to be tied to his production rather than purely a money move. However, with the Panthers’ running game spiraling the drain in terms of production, could it signal a decision to dramatically change philosophy? \nWith a more power-rushing attack under running back Jonathan Stewart and Tolbert, Carolina has tried to punish defenses upfront and wear teams down physically. But with regular injuries to Stewart over the years and a lack of production in 2016, there could be a desire to alter how the Panthers run the ball. Related: Panthers could revamp their backfield this offseason \nInstead of relying on the running back to generate push, the run game can also utilize finesse to beat defenses. The offensive guard can pull, effectively creating a fullback-like blocker on the outside with a speedier running back able to hit the edge and leave defenders trailing him. It’s typically a scheme used with offenses that want to strike quickly and from many different spots instead of a more methodical approach seen in power football. \nWith quarterback Cam Newton effectively being a power runner himself, Carolina could have its cake and eat it too. Utilizing a speedier and more agile running back to hit the outside and be a factor in the passing game out of the backfield, Newton would then be used more on short-yardage situations and as a change of pace. That mentality might fit with the Panthers’ desire to not have Newton be their primary runner, yet still work him into the gameplan and keep him effective as a dual threat.
