From having some of his quirks lampooned by Saturday Night Live to being made to play offense and defense when it comes to certain topics like, you know, the travel ban , the press secretary is dealing with a lot right now. Now, his bungled speech is getting the business, too. \nThe video above is titled “Sean Spicer’s Alternative ABCs.” Get it? A play on Kellyanne Conway ‘s alternative facts ? In the clip, which was made for GQ , Spicer can be seen stumbling through words like “lasterday” (yesterday) and “memererenrderm” (memorandum) along with “plarm” (promise). \nMatt Negrin , the video’s creator, explained his process like this on Twitter: @friedmanusa @KeithOlbermann i did! noticed while watching his briefings..then went back and rewatched all 10 of them, and picked best words \n— Mдтт Иegяiи (@MattNegrin) February 8, 2017 \nFor anyone keeping track, the video has now been shared by James Corden , Ice-T , Rob Delaney , and Ricky Gervais , so it won’t be going away any time soon. \nWatch now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:01:14.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
