They have no real exports so they manufacture lots of fake drugs and target Western markets. \nGETTY SLAVE LABOUR: Reports state that a factory near Pyongyang is making the pills \n“Viagra is one of their main drugs. Some versions have been found to contain some of the ingredients that are in real Viagra but North Korean Viagra has not been clinically tested so you have no idea what you are taking.” \nFake Viagra can cause “visual problems, fainting, dangerous changes in blood pressure and heart problems” the source said. And it can make erectile dysfunction worse. \nOur insider added: “People have complained that their penis size has reduced after taking the fake drug.” Real or fake?

Also, the NHS will only issue four pills at a time. \nDrugs regulators warned last year that organised crime gangs are moving from narcotics into the world of unlicensed medicines.
