There are questions related to the enforceability of swap lines between ECB and Bank of England if the UK is to move out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. \n\"And there is also a question of functioning of financial markets, basically of avoiding fragmentation of the financial markets. It’s a complex issue which we’ll need to assess,\" he continued. \nClearing houses in London manage credit risk, acting as a middle-man in swaps and derivatives trades to guarantee the contract in the event that one of the parties involved in the trade goes bust. \nThe acceptance of English law and widespread use of English language has made London a hub for clearing globally, and it handles more than 70% of the daily euro clearing business, equivalent to around €930 billion (£792 billion, $995 billion) of trades per day, according to a House of Lords report. \nHowever, eurozone financial bigwigs have consistently argued that euro clearing should take place within the euro area, and Britain has repeatedly had to defend its right to clear trades, given that it does not have the euro. In 2015, the UK won a court battle to continue clearing in London. \nHowever, France has repeatedly signalled that it wants to steal the business from London. President Francois Hollande said Britain could not retain its key clearing role shortly after the June 23 referendum. \nLast December, a Financial Times report suggested the European Commission is looking to make a legal changed to allow the European Central Bank control over where euro-based clearing occurs, allowing it to force the activities to occur in a country that uses the euro. That could signal the end of euro clearing in the UK. \nDuring his interview with City AM, stressed the position that the EU isn't looking to \"punish\" Britain for leaving the bloc, saying: \"We have to respect the choice of British voters, and as I said we will certainly the enter the negotiations with the aim to reach agreement which feeds all: which feeds EU 27 and feeds the UK.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T06:18:32.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
