Illiana Christian's Gabby Kreykes, left, drives the ball upcourt against St. Edward's Madison Knott in Monday night's Class 2A Concordia Supersectional. (Jon Langham / Daily Southtown) Privacy Policy \nThings looked so promising for Illiana Christian. \nThe Vikings had the height advantage on St. Edward. They had the lead. No, not just the lead. A big lead. \nBut senior Deborah Smith, or anyone else, was feeling overconfident. \n\"We knew they'd be a hard team to beat,\" she said. \"We knew that it was going to be a tough game still.\" \nIt turned out tougher than tough. It turned out to be a heartbreaking 49-46 loss in Monday's Class 2A Concordia Supersectional. \nSmith had a huge night for the Vikings (23-9) with 14 points and 15 rebounds. St. Xavier recruit Gabby Kreykes contributed 15 points and seven rebounds, and Hope Van Proyen added eight points and nine rebounds. \nMaddie Spagnola scored 18 points and Mallory Rejman had 10 for St. Edward (27-5). \n\"It's a tough loss,\" Kreykes said. \"We all wanted to do our best. One of our goals was to go down to Redbird (Arena) and win the tournament. We all had the same goal.\" \nFor 16 minutes, it appeared they were well on their way. \nThe game plan Vikings coach Tom Knapper drew up was simple. Use their significant height advantage inside. \nNo one used it better than Smith. The 6-foot-1 forward lit up for 10 points in the first quarter as Illiana raced to a 16-8 lead. \nIt got even better. Alyssa Murrin did perimeter damage with a 3-pointer, while Van Proyen was converting underneath. \nDefensively, the Vikings drove St. Edward to distraction. The Green Wave shot 6-for-30 in the first half. \nIt added up to a 29-15 halftime advantage. \n\"It was exciting,\" Smith said. \"I was just hoping that we could keep the momentum going.\" \nThe momentum left quickly. St. Edward started the second half with a 10-0 run. When Spagnola drove and scooped the ball in with 3:08 remaining in the third quarter, the Green Wave shockingly were in front 32-30. \n\"We let our guard down,\" Kreykes said. \"We started slacking on defense and they came back. We didn't play our best.\" \nWhat really hurt were turnovers. Illiana had seven in the third quarter, and St. Edward consistently made the Vikings pay. \nStill, Illiana put itself in a position to survive. With just over four minutes remaining, Kreykes went for back-to-back baskets, leaving the Vikings in front 44-40. \nSt. Edward hit back hard, however. Spagnola scored on back-to-back possessions, including a 3-pointer. Rejman converted two free throws. \nThat erased the lead. Illiana never saw it again. \n\"Maybe they just wore out us out a little bit,\" Knapper said. \"That's a tough team to stop. I can't wait to see what they do downstate. I hope they go a ways.\" \nTwitter @tbaranek", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:51:33.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
