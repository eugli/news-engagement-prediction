I want to thank President Agent Orange for your unsuccessful attempt at the Muslim ban,” Busta Rhymes , who joined the band, said. \nThe group then busted through a makeshift wall — a stand-in for the one Trump hopes to build on the U.S.-Mexico border — before people of various nationalities — some wearing headscarves — took the stage and formed a line.

The Oxnard, Calif., native released his first album, “O.B.E. Vol. 1,” in 2012 under a pseudonym. His more recent recording, “Malibu,” has earned him broader recognition, including from the Recording Academy. \nA Tribe Called Quest, formed in 1985, released their 2016 album, “We Got It From Here … Thank You 4 Your Service,” to much acclaim. Collaborators on the record — the hip hop group’s sixth — include Andre 3000, Kendrick Lamar, Jack White, Elton John, Kanye West, and .Paak. \nIn addition to .Paak and Tribe Called Quest, the 2017 Grammys saw performances from Adele , Bruno Mars , Lukas Graham and many others.
