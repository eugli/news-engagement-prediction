He said it wouldn't take much more for the city to pass the 250 cm mark this season.\n\"If Ottawa does end up with more than 250 cm for this winter,\" Coulson said in an email. \"It would make it the snowiest since 2007-08.\"\nThe 1970-71 record continues to stand. \nA still from archival video of a snow plow digging out an Ottawa street in 1971.
