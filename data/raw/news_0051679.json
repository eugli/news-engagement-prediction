So when the police got there they said go ahead and open the trunk and see what else is missing and I opened the trunk and those shoes were gone as well,” she said.\nThe following items were taken from Carpenter’s car:\nNike Jordan Retro 5s - youth size 4.5 or 5 (black high tops)  Nike KD8 - youth size 4.5 or 5  Nike Air Jordan - youth size 4.5 or 5 (white high tops)  White ladies Carolina Panthers Jersey - Carpenter on the back. Two green guest books  Funeral leaflets  Condolence cards Yellow children's scrap book  The stolen items were some of the last memories Carpenter has of her son and she just wants the items back, no questions asked.\n“It’s only valuable, really, to people who loved him, like me,” she said. “If they knew that they stole from a dead child, that they might do the right thing, you know, either put it back where they got it from, take it to a church or a fire hall and we’ll make sure it gets returned to us.”\nAnyone with information about the theft is asked to contact police or Crime Stoppers.\nPhotos An Alberta mom is looking for the public's help in tracking down a suitcase of mementos that was stolen from her car on the weekend.\nEvan Carpenter died of a sudden brain aneurysm earlier this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:07:40.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
