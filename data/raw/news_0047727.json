Additional tests were commissioned to get to the bottom of what caused their deaths. Questions surround deaths of two belugas Story continues below \nStaff researchers said Monday they still don’t have a definitive cause of why the whales died, despite employing cutting-edge technology in their investigation. \nThey have ruled out bacterial, viral and fungal causes, and narrowed it down to a toxin that vanished quickly. They can’t rule out that it was somehow introduced to the whales. \n“The chain of events leads us to be highly suspect of a toxin,” said head veterinarian Dr. Martin Haulena. “We did not identify any persistent toxins, so whatever happened was introduced to the whales or the whales were introduced to something in the weeks prior to their mortality. It did its damage and it seems to have gone undetected.” \nHaulena said they can’t rule out a malicious intent. \nThe aquarium said it spent well over $100,000 on various diagnostic tools since the whales died to try to crack the mystery. It is also stepping up its security in light of the findings. \nHaulena said — having two whales pass away within a two-week period is unprecedented in the aquarium’s 60-year history. \n“In my 25 years of being a veterinarian, it is absolutely the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my professional career,” he said. \nThe loss of the two whales left a big impact on aquarium’s on-site cetacean program, with only three cetaceans remaining in aquarium’s care — including a harbour porpoise, a Pacific white-sided dolphin and a false killer whale . \nAurora and Qila were the last beluga whales being held at the aquarium. The facility’s five other belugas are living at various locations around the United States. Aurora had lived at the aquarium since 1990. Her offspring Qila was the first beluga to be born in captivity in Canada in 1995. \nThe aquarium has been criticized by animal rights activists for keeping cetaceans in captivity in the past, and there has been a discussion about holding a plebiscite on the issue on the 2018 municipal ballot. \n-With files from Amy Judd and the Canadian Press © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
