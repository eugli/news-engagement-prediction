The hood was damaged. The light was out. The tire was punctured. When I looked to the right of my taxi, there was a Ski-Doo,\" said Vokey, who got there before emergency crews.\nPolice say snowmobiling is not allowed on the bridge near the resort, which is where the accident happened. (CBC)\nVokey said both the driver and the passenger of the snowmobile were on the ground, the driver unresponsive and the passenger moving around.\n\"He kept trying to get up. He was knocked out and kept trying to get up and the people were telling him to stay down until help could come,\" he said.\nPollard died from his injuries Sunday at noon at Western Memorial Regional hospital in Corner Brook.\n'No helmet to be seen, no gloves, no suit, nothing. They were in jeans and a sweat shirt.' - Joe Vokey, first to arrive at accident scene Police said a 26-year-old man who was a passenger on the snowmobile, and one person from the taxi, a Birchy Cab van, were also sent to hospital with injuries.\nVokey said the collision happened at the beginning of the bridge when the van was attempting to enter the resort.\nWhen he approached the scene, he heard the van driver say 'Where the f--- did he [the snowmobiler] come from?'\nNo helmets Vokey said the van was pushed up against the bridge railing, so close to the rail, four unharmed passengers had to climb out on the opposite side.\nWhat surprised him most was how the pair on the snowmobile were dressed.\n\"No helmet to be seen, no gloves, no suit, nothing. They were in jeans and a sweat shirt. That's what blew me out of the water, especially on a big machine like that. It was a brand new machine. Why didn't he have helmet on? If he did have one on it would have been a different outcome,\" Vokey said.\nRCMP are still investigating the crash and do not know if alcohol was a factor. (CBC news )\nOnce he knew help was on the way, he helped move the snowmobile to the side of the bridge and headed back to Corner Brook.\n\"I was shaken. When I got home and situated, I called RCMP in here. They came at 5 o'clock and I gave a statement. I was that tired and shook up â€¦ I couldn't do nothing. There was nothing I could do,\" Vokey said.\nFriends and family of Justyn Pollard told CBC News he was on the west coast for a snowboarding trip to Marble Mountain.\nRCMP told CBC the investigation into what happened is still in its early stages, but snowmobiling is not allowed on the bridge to Humber Valley Resort.\nIt's not clear if alcohol played a role in the collision.\nWith files from Corner Brook Morning Show", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:28:46.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
