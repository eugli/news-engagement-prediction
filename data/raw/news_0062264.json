We will set our sights high and we are going to go for it. \n\n\"I can't remember being more excited ahead of a new season. The car looks aggressive and purposeful, and is the result of a huge effort behind the scenes over the last 12 months.\" \n\nMexican driver Perez, who will be joined at British-based Force India by French rising star Esteban Ocon, was in equally confident mood. \n\n\"Last year we finished fourth so I see no reason why we cannot improve that,\" he said. \"The base is very solid and there are plenty of reasons to be hopeful for that.\" \n\nPerez added: \"That means a massive year for us, but I think Force India will be the big surprise. I really hope we can improve. \n\n\"I am very optimistic about the car and the season. Of course it is easy to talk now, but I have a feeling that Force India has done a tremendous job over the winter. \n\nForce India are the third constructor to launch their new car this week following Sauber and Renault, with Mercedes set to follow suit on Thursday before Ferrari and McLaren do likewise on Friday. \n\nThe first official testing session of the season is in Barcelona on Monday, with the opening race the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 26. \n\nMeanwhile Mallya's business dealings are being looked into by India's Central Bureau of Investigation and the federal Enforcement Directorate, a financial crimes agency. \n\nThis month saw Mallya, known for his extravagance and who once branded himself the \"King of Good Times\", sacked from the board of United Breweries, the firm through which he once controlled his business empire. \n\nHe made Kingfisher beer a global brand and ran a now-defunct airline with the same name, besides being the owner of a cricket side and Force India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:34:54.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
