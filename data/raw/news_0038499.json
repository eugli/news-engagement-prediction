Heroes like the Flash and Green Arrow have become even more popular thanks to the network’s live-action adaptations. Over the years, a slew of DC Comics heroes and villains have debuted on the hit dramas, and the Suicide Squad is no exception. Over on Arrow , the group of criminals were featured briefly before the team was forced to disband in light of Warner Brother’s film focusing on the ragtag team. \nBut, according to one Arrow star, fans should not totally disregard a Suicide Squad comeback on cable. \nRecently, David Ramsey spoke with CinemaBlend about his work on Arrow as the show continues with its fifth season. It was there the actor was asked about the possibility of a Suicide Squad comeback, and here’s what the star had to say: \n“I can say that we have all the elements. Part of what John Diggle brings to the team is his relationship with ARGUS through his wife Lyla. We're waiting to see how that plays itself out. Diggle was freed last week, and Oliver said to him 'You can go home and hug your wife and son.' So that's a real viable part of Diggle that we have always seen on camera, but it would be nice to see more because he's married to the leader of the Suicide Squad,” Ramsey said. \n“What does that play out? How does that look? What are those conversations like? We have all the elements of it... I think we have the makings of it. ARGUS is a real viable part of our whole universe, of Legends, Flash, and Arrow. And Diggle just so happens to be married to the leader of ARGUS, so it's right there ready for the picking.” \nOf course, fans had their own response to the team’s departure from Arrow . Even stars of the show commented about Suicide Squad being removed as Willa Holland called out Warner Bros. for forcing the characters off cable. \n“We were about season two when they started telling us we had to start basically killing off the Suicide Squad that we were starting to build on our own,” Holland told The Mirror. “We were actually trying to build that on our own on the show, and I guess once DC found out they were going to be doing their own movie of it, we had to ax all of the characters before we even got to show them, which was a little annoying at first.” \nSo, what do you think? Would you like to see the Suicide Squad make a return to the DC TV Universe?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:19:36.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
