Prepare yourself for the sushi burrito. The Houston Business Journal reports that U’Maki Sushi Burrito will open its doors at 10111 Louetta Road this spring , bringing the city’s first restaurant that solely focuses on the trendy sushi burrito. For the unfamiliar, a sushi burrito is essentially a giant, unsliced sushi roll that is wrapped in nori and stuffed with raw fish and other fillings. As far as the menu is concerned, diners will be able to build their own sushi burritos, choosing a variety of proteins like soft shell crab, salmon, and tuna, veggies, sauces, and garnishes to round out their giant rolls. The restaurant will also offer a menu of “house favorite” burritos featuring classic sushi roll combinations. U-Maki is currently scheduled to open in April, though no concrete date has been set just yet. In the meantime, you’ll have to survive on regular-sized sushi rolls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:35:01.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
