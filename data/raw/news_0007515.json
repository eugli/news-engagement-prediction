But it’s unclear whether they’ll be able to earn the votes needed to sustain the filibuster and force the constitutional showdown. \nOnly one Supreme Court nominee has ever faced a partisan filibuster attempt. Democrats tried to derail Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. in 2006, but fell short, and he was confirmed. \nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said Wednesday that Judge Gorsuch will become the second. \n“This administration, at least at its outset, seems to have less respect for the rule of law, than any in recent memory,” Mr. Schumer said. “There’s a special burden on this nominee to be an independent jurist.” \nThe New York Democrat has long dismissed the argument that judges should evaluated based on their legal credentials rather than on their judicial philosophy. Mr. Schumer has been unabashed in saying his goal is to force an ideological shift, and said the Gorsuch nomination will be a major test of that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T19:34:28.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
