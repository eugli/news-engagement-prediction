Trends Ukraine turmoil \nDuring the UN Security Council meeting dealing with the recent escalation of violence in Eastern Ukraine, the US and the UK ambassadors teamed up to attack Russia, instead of focusing on Kiev’s actions which has driven the frozen conflict to new heights.

The United States continues to condemn and call for an immediate end to the Russian occupation of Crimea,” Haley added. “Crimea is a part of Ukraine. Our Crimea-related sanctions will remain in place until Russia returns control of the peninsula to Ukraine.” \nTaking the floor, Russia’s envoy stressed that it is Kiev who is responsible for the escalation of violence, and not Russia which has nothing to do with fighting there. \n“The essence of those events is quite clear: Kiev is trying to use the armed clashes that it provoked as a pretext for a complete rejection of the February 12, 2015, Minsk agreements, sealed by the UN Security Council resolution 2202,” Churkin said in Russian, TASS reports. #Churkin : All data including frank confessions of Ukrainian officials leave no room to deny destructive policy of Kiev and its armed forces pic.twitter.com/g1hUykl4R2 — Russian Mission UN (@RussiaUN) February 3, 2017 \nThe diplomat went on to list public remarks made by the Ukrainian officials over recent days which clearly proved that it was indeed Kiev that has escalated the situation there. He also cited OSCE reports and surveillance data which places the blame squarely on the Ukrainian government and not the rebel forces. #Churkin : Any escalation of the situation in #Donbas region miraculously coincides with overseas trips of the Ukrainian leadership pic.twitter.com/qASJcwd43i — Russian Mission UN (@RussiaUN) February 3, 2017 \nChurkin also noted the correlation between Petro Poroshenko’s trips abroad and the escalation of violence in the Donbass.

Ukraine flare-up: Kiev trying to extort US, EU cash by playing the victim \n“Any serious intensification of hostilities in Donbass miraculously coincides with foreign visits of the Ukrainian leadership. Apparently, this is how Kiev expects to keep the crisis that it had provoked on the international agenda,” Churkin said. \n“And, of course, the Ukrainian leadership needs money today, that can easily wheedle out of the European Union, some European nations, the United States and international financial institutions when they pretend to be a victim of ‘aggression’,” the diplomat added. \nInstead of “searching sensible compromises” to end the conflict, the envoy stressed, Kiev is “pressing for a military solution.” \nChurkin called for an immediate ceasefire and swift de-escalation of the situation “to prevent disaster and to return the situation to the political track.” \n“We trust that those with common sense within Ukraine itself and also all those keen to settle issues of this kind through political means will not allow the situation in southeastern Ukraine to develop along the worse-case scenario,” Churkin said, instead advising Kiev to focus their efforts on immediately implementing the Minsk peace agreements. \nBut Churkin’s speech did not impress the British Ambassador to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, who accused the Russian side of misinforming the council. \n“We frequently hear from the Russian government, as we did today, that all the problems in eastern Ukraine are the consequence of actions by the Ukrainian government. This is simply not the case. It is an inversion of reality.” Great #UNSC debut speech by @NikkiHaley today.
