Picture: Caters News Agency Paul Harper The Sun \nTHIS is the spectacular moment a photographer captured lightning bolts striking lava spurts from an erupting volcano. \nHernando Rivera struck gold with the dazzling snaps at the Volcán de Colima, The Sun reports. \nThe graphic designer camped out in freezing conditions around 12km from the famous site in central Mexico. \nThis proved the perfect vantage point of the centuries-old active volcano, which is surrounded by an 8km exclusion zone. \nHis stunning pictures, taken last Thursday, show white-hot lava spouting from the crater 3,800m above sea level, before lightning bolts emerge from clouds of black smoke. Damn.

I was alone at night when I took them. I like to go alone.” \n“Sometimes I get as close as 7km or 5km, but on this occasion I was 12km away. When I took the pictures, my reaction was one of happiness because they look spectacular. \n“The lightning is caused by friction within particles. They are too hot and crash, creating static, and this kind of phenomenon leads to lightning. Stunning.
