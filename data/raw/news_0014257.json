Reuters 3 Allardyce has made little difference to Palace since taking charge in December \nAnd the woeful manner of the team’s display as they crashed 4-0 at home to relegation rivals Sunderland has set the alarm bells ringing in south London. \nAllardyce has lost five and won just once in the Premier League since he took charge of the Eagles just before Christmas. \nPardew had a similar record in his last seven games in charge when the Palace hierarchy decided he had lost his way with the side. \nBut at least Pardew had his team scoring goals, the team hit the net 14 times in that run. Reuters Alan Pardew had a similar record to Allardyce in his last seven matches at Palace – but at least his team scored more goals Crystal Palace 0-4 Sunderland : Black Cats run riot at Selhurst Park \nPalace have only scored four times under Allardyce, and conceded just as many as they did when Pardew was failing. \nIt has led to questions being asked among the supporters whether Allardyce has lost his magic touch in being able to turn around a failing side. \nNot only has he been unable to make any difference to one of the most fragile defences in the league, he has managed to make them less of a threat going forward.
