Police are investigating party girl Tara's death   \nLeft untreated, it would have eaten away at her insides. \nEven with treatment it could have been fatal. \nAnd Tara's battles with drugs were long-standing. \nFriends although she went clean for long periods, the former It girl never fully beat her cocaine habit. \nShe famously spoke of it costing her £400-a-day at one point and left Tara needing septum reconstruction surgery in 2006. \nAlthough police are continuing to investigate, a post-mortem exam will ultimately decide her cause of death. \nAn inquest into the full circumstances surrounding her death is likely to be held at a later date. \nFriends and neighbours have spoken of their sadness at Tara's death. \nShe was a long-standing friend of Prince Charles and had a close relationship with the Royal Family. \nNeighbours told of how she used drive her silver BMW 645Ci \"very fast and furious\" down the street. \nBut she was hailed as \"very sweet\" by the local community. \nAnne Swift said: \"We always saw her driving very fast and furious in her car, she always lived life to the full.
