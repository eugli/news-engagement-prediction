But the wiry protagonist of \"The Dime,\" Kathleen Kent's terrific crime fiction debut, is anything but your typical Texas cop. Nearly 6 feet tall, with bright red hair, she hails from Brooklyn, doesn't like much of anything about Texas and may well be the only openly lesbian officer in 500 miles. She lives with Jackie, a pediatric radiologist whose hopes for a tranquil home life get eighty-sixed when the severed head of the biggest cocaine supplier in the area is delivered to their door. And then things get worse. Betty becomes entangled not only in the dealings of a Mexican drug cartel and local meth dealers but also the nasty designs of a strange family-run cult led by the world's scariest mom. Betty has no family herself after the cancer deaths of her father and uncle and the suicide of her brother, all of them cops. For someone whose life has been defined by loss, will it ever be possible to \"expunge the dark chaos\" surrounding her? Guided through her dreams by her beloved, decorated uncle, who was full of sayings — \"Are you done Reaping the Grim?\" — she learns to reject victimhood by relying on her wits. Kent's own ability to avoid predictable outcomes and keep the reader on edge bodes well for future installments in this series. \n\"August Snow\" by Stephen Mack Jones, Soho Crime, 320 pages, $25.95 \nStephen Mack Jones' rock-solid debut, \"August Snow,\" is powered by the outgoing personality of the title hero and his deep affections for his hometown of Detroit. The loving son of an African-American father and Mexican-American mother who lives in the house in which he grew up, Snow is intent on contributing to the Motor City's rebound from bankruptcy by rehabbing houses in his neighborhood. He has a ton of money to spend on the cause, having won $12 million in a wrongful dismissal suit against the city after the force pushed him out for testifying against dirty cops. When ill-tempered philanthropist Eleanor Paget dies of what police say was a self-inflicted gunshot but Snow suspects was murder, he doubles down on his promise to investigate shady dealings at her wealth management bank. He is drawn into a web of violence involving her family members and associates, most of whom are not who they appear to be. The assault scenes pitting Snow and a woman he's protecting against a stream of gunmen seem imported from a different kind of thriller. But Jones, whose background as a playwright figures into his mastery of one-on-one dialogue scenes, is otherwise in complete command. Whether focusing on a street kid that Snow rescues from a life of crime or licking his lips over the tangy food offerings in Mexicantown — don't miss Schmear's Deli — this author proves himself a natural entertainer. \n\"What You Break\" by Reed Farrel Coleman, Putnam, 368 pages, $27 \nA retired cop who drives an airport shuttle and works security for a dumpy hotel out on Long Island, Gus Murphy is slowly recovering from the unexpected death of his 20-year-old son and the end of his marriage. Trouble rears its head after he accepts an offer from an overbearing rich guy \"who looked like he was wearing sins in the pores of his skin\" to investigate the brutal murder of the man's granddaughter. And then a Russian hit man comes gunning for Murphy's darkly mysterious friend Slava, the night bellman. A onetime policeman in Russia, the Polish-born Slava saved Murphy's butt in \"Where It Hurts,\" the debut novel in this first-rate series, and Murphy is happy to return the favor. But his bond is tested when he learns that Slava, to his friend's eternal shame, participated in bombing atrocities in Chechnya. What should he do when the assassin threatens to harm his actress girlfriend Maggie if he doesn't tell him where he has stashed Slava? A man \"ambitious in his rage,\" Murphy is also quite the romantic. Coleman overplays the grief and girlfriend business but more than makes up for that with his deft mix of corrupt cops, gangbangers, drug dealers and makers of \"ghost guns.\" And the scruffy side of Suffolk County (read: not the Hamptons) has rarely been captured more colorfully. Considering how dim most of the settings are, that's saying something. \nLloyd Sachs, a regular contributor to the Tribune, is the author of \"T Bone Burnett: A Life in Pursuit.\" \nJust in time for Valentine's Day, the Poetry Foundation lists its top 10 most popular love poems, as measured by page views.
