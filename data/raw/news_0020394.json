John McCain, R-Ariz., said out-of-state critics of President Donald Trump have been tying up phone lines at his offices. Callers wanting to leave messages about Trump nominees also have been having a hard time getting through to Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.   (Photo: Charlie Leight/The Republic) \nCallers for at least a few weeks now have been having trouble getting through to leave messages for Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake because their voicemail boxes are constantly full .\nThe offices of McCain and Flake, both Arizona Republicans, have been deluged with telephone calls from people wanting to express opinions about President Donald Trump's Cabinet picks who are up for Senate confirmation. That's led to frustration for many of the senators' constituents.\nGroups have run television ads in Arizona urging viewers to call McCain and Flake to tell them to vote against one of Trump's nominees or another. The liberal organization MoveOn.org also has been encouraging Trump critics to call their senators.\n\"Our phone lines are always jammed,\" McCain told The Arizona Republic . \"And it's unfortunate, because a lot of the calls that we get are from outside of Arizona and are clearly orchestrated. Of course, they're all against Trump. And that deprives the people inside Arizona from getting their messages through to me and to Senator Flake. He's experiencing the same thing.\"\nFlake acknowledged the problem Wednesday in a Twitter message. Flake tweeted that he and his staff are still taking calls, but added that anyone having trouble getting through could send him a written message through his website. \nMy staff & I are here taking your calls but if you're having trouble getting through you can send me an email at https://t.co/GEUP6Q9NLY \nâ€” Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) February 1, 2017 \nThe calls probably won't be letting up anytime soon. The liberal group People for the American Way on Friday began running a new TV ad in Arizona telling viewers to call McCain and Flake to tell them to reject Neil Gorsuch, Trump's nominee for U.S. Supreme Court justice.\nMcCain and Flake already have said they like the Gorsuch pick .\nNowicki is The Republic's national political reporter.
