I don’t want to sell him, I want him to stay here for a long time until he decides.” \nExplaining his decision to name an unchanged forward line, Guardiola told Sky Sports: \"They did really well in the last three games. The first pressure is so intensive. \n\"They attack a lot with runs behind and they have the quality in front of goal.\" \nClaudio Bravo also remains on the bench with Willy Caballero starting in goal. \nBacary Sagna could line up at centre back aget bing named ahead of Vincent Kompany in the starting XI.
