Meanwhile, Brad Jones has kept more clean sheets per 90 minutes than any other goalkeeper in Europe. By Tweet \nMooy continues to impress in his debut season with Huddersfield, with even Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola hailing the on-loan Australian as \"amazing\". \nThis season Mooy has played in a deeper role for Huddersfield than he did for Melbourne City, going from being a creative number 10 to a holding midfielder. \nBut the former Western Sydney Wanderers player seems to be adjusting aptly, averaging 74 successful passes per 90 minutes. The second highest in the Championship behind Tom Cairney of Fulham on 74.7. Mooy could become the $30 million man as Premier League suitors circle Aaron Mooy's soaring valuation has hit a new peak with compliments from Pep Guardiola pushing his market worth, in the eyes of at least one Premier League club, into the $30 million range. \nWhat makes that number even more impressive is when you compare it to some of Europe's finest players. \nMooy is above Manchester City pair Fernandinho (67) and David Silva (62), as speculation grows as to whether Guardiola will ever bring the Aussie into his squad. \nMooy is also above Barcelona's Sergio Busquets (61) and Real Madrid's Toni Kroos (71) who both play very similar roles to the Australian and equal with Manchester United's Paul Pogba (74). \nAdmittedly these players face harder opposition, although they also play with far superior teammates around them. \nAnd it's not just passing for the sake of keeping possession and maintaining control. Mooy averages 2.1 chances created per match, which is more than Liverpool's Firmino (2), Pogba (1), United's Juan Mata (1.7), Madrid's Luka Modric (1.5) and Barca's Andres Iniesta (1.1). #HTAFC 's Aaron Mooy averages more passes made and chances created per 90 minutes than Paul Pogba, Luca Modric and Fernandinho. \n— HTAFCstats (@htafcstats) February 20, 2017 \nMeanwhile, Australian goalkeeper Brad Jones is pushing his claims for Socceroos selection with his outstanding form at Eredivisie league leaders Feyenoord. \nJones has conceded just 11 goals in 22 matches, keeping 14 clean sheets. No player in Europe has more clean sheets per 90 minutes than him. FC Porto's Iker Casillas is closest with 13 in 22 matches. 14 - Brad Jones is the first @Feyenoord keeper with 14 clean sheets in an Eredivisie season since Ed de Goey in 1996/97. Secure. pic.twitter.com/dXbiVOgsds \n— OptaJohan (@OptaJohan) February 20, 2017 \nTo add perspective, Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois has 13 clean sheets in 25, Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer has 9 in 21 and Barcelona's Marc ter Stegen has 10 in 21. \nThe only two 'keepers to have more is Scott Carson in the Championship with Derby, 14 but in 29 matches, and Zenit St. Petersburg's Yuri Lodygin, 16 in 28 matches. \nJones has also conceded fewer goals (11) than Neuer (13), Gianluigi Buffon (16), Hugo Lloris (17) and Cortois (18) and is equal to Casillas (11 in 22).
