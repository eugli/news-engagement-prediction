Getting ready: Volunteer K. Subramaniam,67, washing the compound of Sri Subramaniar Temple in Gunung Cheroh in preparation for Thaipusam. \nThaipusam is celebrated on the full moon day in the month of Thai, the 10th month in the Hindu calendar. \nOn this day, devotees show appreciation to their deity Lord Muruga and do penance. \nThe colours of Lord Muruga, yellow and orange, dominate the festival. \nIn Kuala Lumpur, devotees thronged the Batu Caves temple to fulfil their vows yesterday. \nSome devotees were seen carrying milk pots for Lord Muruga while others performed rituals that required them to roll over again and again throughout the temple grounds. \nMost Hindus were at the temple earlier to avoid the massive crowd this Thaipusam on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:14:13.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
