(Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Miami Dolphins appear to have made one of the first substantial moves of the NFL offseason. \nThe Dolphins agreed to acquire tight end Julius Thomas from the Jacksonville Jaguars in exchange for a late-round 2017 NFL draft pick, according to The Miami Herald . \nTrades cannot become official until the start of the new league year on March 9. \nThomas had just 30 catches for 281 yards and four touchdowns last season for Jacksonville while being to limited just nine games after fracturing his tailbone. After signing a five-year, $46 million contract with the team in 2015, Thomas recorded just 76 catches for 736 yards and nine touchdowns. \nBut the trade would reunite the tight end with Dolphins coach Adam Gase, who served as the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos from 2013-14 when Thomas caught a combined 24 touchdowns and went to two Pro Bowls. Dolphins tight ends Jordan Cameron, Dion Sims and Dominique Jones are all set to become free agents. \nThe Herald also reported that the two teams were still discussing a separate trade Monday that would send offensive tackle Branden Albert to the Jaguars. \nPHOTOS: Best potential NFL free agents Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:13:32.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
