That’s if they’re even allowed to speak.\nConsider last week’s House Government Committee hearing where our leaders held what I will laughingly call a public hearing about one of the bills to limit ballot initiatives.\nThe Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry – the folks leading the charge on the bill -- was given three minutes to explain why it should pass. Citizens, meanwhile, were given 60 seconds to defend their constitutional rights – and that included the time it took to walk to the podium and introduce themselves.\nEven then, Rep. Bob Thorpe felt the need to constantly interrupt, providing a countdown of how much time they had left to speak.\nConsider a meeting earlier this month by the House Education Committee, which was to hear a bill to expand school vouchers.\nThe meeting was scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. and the hearing room was packed with people sporting “I love public education” stickers. So naturally, it didn’t start until 3:20 p.m. and was kicked off not with the voucher bill that people were there to talk about but with two presentations that had nothing to do with any of the bills on the agenda.\nOnce it was fiiiinanlly time to consider bills, the voucher bill was set for eighth on the agenda. Eighth.\nCue Rivko Knox, lobbyist for the League of Women Voters of Arizona:\n“One of those present with children (and there were several there with such), asked the Chair to move HB 2394 up on the list, as it was obvious that most of the people there (stickers) were there to speak about it. He refused. So, we sat and sat and sat and sat. Those with children left.\"\nAt 6:14 p.m., the committee took a 36-minute break, just about the time 25 or 30 people wearing \"ESAs YES\" and \"Si, ESAs\" showed up.\n\"Someone had told them when it ‘their’ bill would be heard,\" Knox said. \"By the time the bill was called, and I got a chance to testify, it was almost 9 p.m. and the hearing continued long after.”\nCurious, isn’t it, that those who supported the bill knew to show up four hours after the meeting was supposed to begin in order to be heard?\nNot surprisingly, the bill passed – but without the chance for many of those who had shown up to at the appointed time SEVEN HOURS earlier to register their objections.\nThose two experiences aren’t unique. I’ve heard tales of hearing rooms full of people waiting hours for the chance to speak about a bill, only to be told one the bill was finally called that only one or two people could speak.\nOh-so-sorry, the public is told, but agendas are full and time is limited.\nSo shortcuts are taken – smack through right to be heard.\nI understand deadlines. I understand that our leaders have a lot of bills to get through. But here’s the thing I would tell them.\nYou work for us . You’re doing our business. Surely you can give three minutes of your precious time to a citizen who came all the way to the Capitol to speak at what's supposed to be a public hearing..\nIf you don’t have the time to adequately consider what they have to say -- pro or con -- then sorry, but you don’t have time to pass the bill.\nIt's not fair and it smacks of arrogance, whether intended or not.\nSimply put: People deserve to be heard.\nIf not now, then certainly next year, when you come around asking for their vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:38:53.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
