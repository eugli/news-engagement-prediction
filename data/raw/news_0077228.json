Tuohy was playing for Oldham Athletic at the time of the alleged offences (Photo: Manchester Evening News) Tuohy was embraced by members of his family outside court (Photo: Cavendish Press) \nThe Crown alleged Tuohy went on to groom the youngster, who sent him a topless selfie photograph, through social media, before she performed a sex act on him in his Seat Ibiza car parked in a secluded location in Oldham. \nBut Tuohy's lawyers suggested it was the girl who initiated contact shortly after the tournament with the then 19-year-old and that she had known him for \"some considerable time\" and had \"liked\" photographs he had posted on social media. \nPaul Hodgkinson, defending, told the court the Crown's portrayal of his client as a \"manipulative\" individual who preyed on a \"starstruck\" besotted schoolgirl was \"nonsense\". \nHe said Tuohy was \"not some over-privileged, arrogant overpaid footballer driving around in his Lamborghini\" but someone who had played football every spare second of his life and had been with Oldham Athletic since the age of 13. Tuohy now plays for non-league Shaw Lane (Photo: PA) \nHe said he was not \"a party animal\" but someone on modest wages at Oldham, when the alleged offences were said to have taken place, who had to observe 10pm curfews. \nTuohy, who had attracted interest from the Republic of Ireland national team, was currently out of contract and playing for Shaw Lane, a semi-professional team in Barnsley, for Â£100 a week, the court heard. \nMr Hodgkinson put it to the complainant that her account that she told Tuohy in a conversation on Snapchat that she was 14 did not take place. \nGiving evidence, the girl also denied she tried to make herself look older on her Facebook page. \nTuohy was cleared of two counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of meeting with a child following sexual grooming.
