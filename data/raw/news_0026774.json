(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) We're never not wowed by any of Carrie Underwood's on-stage performances, and the 2017 Grammy Awards was no exception. The country star—who is nominated for Best Country Solo Performance for her song \"Church Bells\"—took the stage in a sequined mini dress (to show off her killer legs, natch) with fellow country artist (and Grammy nominee) Keith Urban to perform their hit track \"The Fighter\" from Urban's Ripcord album. Urban wrote the song with Underwood specifically in mind: \"I thought I really would love to write a duet that isn’t the traditional guy and girl singing together, but the girl maybe asking a question and the guy answering her,\" Urban previously told Sounds Like Nashville . \"Then we set about thinking about who would be the right voice for this and Carrie—I love, love her voice and always have. And so I sent her the song and fortunately she loved it.\" And the audience loved their Grammys performance of the track, which featured a technicolor lit stage that was as bright and fun as Underwood and Urban's infectious lyrics and power vocals.
