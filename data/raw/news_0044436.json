Who would believe this?” Mr. Trump told the crowd. “Sweden … They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible.” \nThe Fox News “Tucker Carlson Tonight” show aired a report Friday night about documentary maker Ami Horowitz and his film about immigration and Sweden. The documentary asserted that Sweden’s generous immigration policy was linked to a rise in crime, and that the Swedish government has tried to cover it up. \n“Sweden had its first terrorist Islamic attack not that long ago, so they’re now getting a taste of what we’ve been seeing across Europe already,” Mr. Horowitz told Mr. Carlson, apparently referring to a suicide bomber attack in 2010 in Stockholm. \nWhite House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Sunday that Mr. Trump was referring to “rising crime and recent incidents in general” in Sweden. \nThe president’s comments provoked strong reactions in Sweden, including one from a former prime minister, who asked on Twitter, “What is he smoking?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:19:47.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
