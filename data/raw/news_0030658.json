This includes, but not limited to the fact that the North West has produced nearly all the leaders from the entire North. \n“From the late Gen Murtala Muhammed, to President Shehu Shagari, to Gen Sani Abacha, to President Umoru Yar’Adua and the current President Muhammadu Buhari. \nIn view of the aforementioned scenario, it is crystal clear that North East has been sidelined in the affair of our great country”. adekunle ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:31:46.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
