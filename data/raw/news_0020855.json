SUPPLIED \nAngus building his mansion on Minecraft in the oncology ward at Wellington Hospital. \nThe stolen device was donated by the Wellington Hospitals Foundation and foundation chairman Bill Day said the \"outstanding\" response in the wake of the theft meant the oncology ward \"will be up and running with a new one on Monday, that's for sure.\" \nREAD MORE: \n​ One benefactor had offered to replace the PlayStation – which had been bolted to a moveable table – while about 60 smaller donations had been lodged through the foundation's website by Saturday morning. SUPPLIED \nThe PlayStation was unscrewed from this table last weekend. \nDay said he hadn't tallied the donations, but it looked like the foundation would be able to buy two or three units with the money received. \nOffers and donations from around the world had also flooded in via a Facebook support page for Angus and a Givealittle page . \nA DHB spokeswoman said the hospital had also received \"far more offers than we need\" and was directing donors to the foundation's website . MONIQUE FORD/ FAIRFAX NZ \nAngus's mum said: \"He knows it's an adult that's probably done it, but he can't understand why they would do that to sick kids.\" \n\"We've been overwhelmed by the huge response and generosity of the public, with many people offering to purchase new PlayStations or donate their old one,\" she said. Ad Feedback \n\"This has been so heartening and the children will be really pleased to hear that we'll have a PlayStation back in the ward soon.\" \nWhile last weekend's theft had been reported to police, Day said he did not believe there had been any progress finding those responsible. \nAngus, who needs chemotherapy once a week for an inoperable brain tumour, is among about 15 patients who attend the day stay unit every week. \nAngus said playing his favourite game, Minecraft​, on the PlayStation made the three-hour procedure more bearable. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:31:51.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
