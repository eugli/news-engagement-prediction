Singapore Territorial Waters', which indicates the areas in which night curfew arrangements were to be enforced, and designates three areas where night fishing was permitted.\nDated March 25, 1962, a map shows the limits of Singaporean territorial waters at a point south of Pulau Tekon Besar in the Johor Strait; \"they do not extend to the vicinity of Pedra Branca\".\nIn the application, Malaysia emphasised that it did not make this revision application lightly.\n\"Revision proceedings are exceptional. It is only after careful consideration that the Government of Malaysia has decided to submit this application.\n\"This application is not an appeal against the 2008 judgement. On the contrary, it draws to the court's attention what has only recently become known to Malaysia.\"  - Bernama", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:26:14.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
