Some have seen that has a dig, or a compliment at its most backhanded, but I don’t see it that way. When a show is as good at achieving its goal as This Is Us is, then it’s ultimately successful. It may not be able to reach some intangible emotional truth, but that doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy its facsimile of such. But “Memphis” felt even more genuine that it ever has before, and it was a truly wonderful episode. \n“Memphis” was an excellent entry into the road trip episode genre, where two characters go on a journey both physical and metaphorical, because we’re also going on this journey with them as well. Rather than pay lip service to the other characters, “Memphis” belongs entirely to Randall and William, who have remained the most compelling relationship on a show built on intertwined relationships. Instead of bouncing back to the adolescence of the Big Three, or the earlier lives of Jack and Rebecca, “Memphis” dedicates itself to William’s story. William from the first episode on has done his work to win us over. In the pilot, he was the junkie who abandoned his son, but by the end of his time on This Is Us , William gets justification and a backstory. He was a former genius who could have made it big with his cousin ( Atlanta ’s Brian Tyree Henry, almost render unrecognizable in old man makeup). He was a man in pain, himself grieving the loss of his mother. William acknowledges he’s not blameless in his own downfall, but at least we get to see the downfall and its impetus. “I want them to remember looking up at me, not down,” William says to Randall about Beth and is granddaughters. Randall gave William the ability to decide how he was going to viewed by the girls, something that he didn’t have the option of dictating for most of his life. And “Memphis” similarly allowed us to change our perspective as well. \nPerhaps I had succeeded in deluding myself, that because William had become such an important part of the This Is Us ensemble, that he would somehow make it out of this one. He would make some incredible recovery that I would roll my eyes at for its convenient timing, but secretly be fine with because it would mean more time with Ron Cephas Jones who has made William such a fully-formed, and entirely charming, character over the course of the first season. But William could never really make it out alive, and if losing him meant getting “Memphis,” than perhaps it was worth it. \nThis episode felt different from the rest as William sat by Jack’s tree and paid his respects. From one father to another, William said, “I would have liked to have met my father’s son.” It was such a lovely and pure moment. Jones didn’t overplay it, he kept it simple. His voice was full of gratitude, just a man at the end of his life giving thanks to another man for stepping in and doing something he was not capable of doing himself. In a way though, he wasn’t just thanking Jack for raising Randall, but Jack for raising Randall in such a way so that he might be able to experience the perfect bookend to a life that was not a happy one. That gratitude was writ large as Randall held his father in his hands as William slipped away. Jack taught Randall how to stay calm, and Randall was able to pass that onto his father. \nNone of this would have worked without the strong performances of Jones and Sterling K. Brown, who has proven time and time again that he’s the show’s creative center. He brings this child-like sweetness and excitement to Randall that Jones mirrors as he finds the toy he hid in his old house. “I left them here once and after all these years later, they’re still here. Isn’t that something?” William says upon finding his treasures. “Isn’t it strange how the world sticks and moves like that?” That could really be the mantra for the entire show; as the Pearsons to move forward in their lives, they continue to reflect the past already lived out by Jack and Rebecca. The circumstances aren’t entirely the same, but some things always stick, while others change. \nWhile Brown is his charming self, this episode belonged to Jones. His goodbye to the son he gave the up the opportunity to raise was so gorgeous, and like his respects to Jack, was stripped down and simple: \nWilliam: Roll all your windows down, Randall, crank up the music, crank up that ‘fro. Let someone else make your bed. \nRandall: I like making my damn bed, old men. \nWilliam: Then make it. You deserve it, You deserve the beautiful life you made. You deserve it Randall. My beautiful boy, my son. \nI’m crying just reading those lines back, thinking of the way Jones delivered them. It was a moment of emotional and honesty and beauty, something that I was okay with This Is Us not reaching on a regular basis. But the show exceeded my expectations, and it was worth the wait. Stray observations Brian Tyree Henry and Sterling K. Brown are apparently best friends in real life and I would like to be invited to that dinner party, please and thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:25:28.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
