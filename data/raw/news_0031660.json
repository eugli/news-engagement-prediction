And, seriously, Josh turned to me — and we were no one at the time — he said, ‘If we ever go to the Grammys, if we ever win a Grammy, we should receive it just like this.' ” Adele \nRecord of the year, Hello \n\"The comeback, as it were, was completely masterminded by (you) and you executed it incredibly,\" she told manager Jonathan Dickins. \"I owe you everything. We've been together for 10 years and I love you like you're my dad. I don't love my dad, that's the thing, so it doesn't mean a lot, but I love you like I would love my dad!\" \nShe then turned her attention to her biggest competitor, Beyoncé. \" My idol is Queen Bey and I adore you and you move my soul and you have every day for nearly 17 years. I adore you and I want you to be my mommy, all right?\" \nAlbum of the year, 25 \n\"Five years ago, when I was last here, I also was pregnant and I didn't know,\" Adele explained. \"I found out shortly afterward, which was the biggest blessing of my life, and in my pregnancy and becoming a mother, I lost a lot of myself. And I struggled, and I still do struggle as a mum. It's really hard.

The Lemonade album was so monumental and so well thought-out and so beautiful and soul-baring and we got to see another side to you that you don't always let us see and we appreciate that. And all the artists here (expletive) adore you. You are our light. And the way you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel is empowering and you make them stand up for themselves and I love you.\" Can't stop thinking about Adele professing her love and adoration for Beyoncé and Beyoncé crying. #GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/WV9UoIBIAg — Alex Goldschmidt (@alexandergold) February 13, 2017 Beyoncé \nUrban contemporary album for Lemonade \nJust as every second of Lemonade was meticulously thought out, so, too, was her acceptance speech, which was written on a gold card that matched her Indian goddess costume.
