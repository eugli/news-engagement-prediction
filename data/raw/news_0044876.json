There was no rule book for how to deal with this.\" \nIt also features comment from investigators who were tasked with discovering what went wrong with the drugs trial on March 13, 2006. \nAt the time, there were concerns the drug could have been tampered with, leading the volunteers to suffer horrific and life-changing side-effects. \nAnd it looks at the impact of the trial on the patients themselves. \nOne participant reveals: \"I thought I was doing something good for science, but in the end it was the worst thing I could ever have done.\" Participant David Oakley, who appears in a new BBC documentary, suffered excruciating back pain (Photo: BBC) Ryan had to spend four months in hospital after suffering heart, liver and kidney failure (Photo: BBC) Read More \nThe trial was carried out at a private unit at Northwick Park Hospital in north-west London run by Parexel, a US company that helps pharmaceutical and biomedical companies develop and launch their products. \nTGN1412 was intended to treat leukaemia and chronic inflammatory conditions. \nAlthough it had never been tested on humans, it had been successfully tried out on monkeys - so medics were hopeful about the outcome. \nBecause the eight volunteers, aged between 19 and 34, had signed up to a Phase 1 trial, they were to become the first people to try the drug. \nOf them, two were given a placebo. \nThe participants, who all knew there were risks involved, were given an 11-page consent form to fill out ahead of the trial, the Daily Mail reports. \nIn exchange for receiving the drug - developed by a German company - intravenously, they had been offered £2,000.

Participant Raste Khan was not aware that he was one of the two people who received a placebo (Photo: BBC) \nRob Oldfield, who was one of the six men affected, previously told the BBC how he was rushed to intensive care at around midnight. \nAt about 2am, his mum was told to come to the hospital. \"The doctors were saying this is your goodbye perhaps - this person could die,\" he said. \nAlthough Rob and the five others survived, they were left worrying about how their health might be affected in the future by the trial. \nIndeed, the potential long-term effects on their immune systems are not known. \nSome of the participants have since received compensation from Parexel. \nThe Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency produced a report in April 2006 following the disaster, which made headlines across the world. Rob Oldfield, who also took part in the trial, says he was rushed to intensive care at around midnight (Photo: BBC) \nSoon after, the Health Secretary established a group of leading international experts to look into what could be learned from the trial. \nIn December that year, the group's report was published, with 22 recommendations to improve the safety of future Phase 1 trials. \nThese included that independent expert advice is needed before a high-risk study, and that volunteers cannot all be tested in the same day.
