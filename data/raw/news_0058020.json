However the Jakarta-based airline denied the claim, adding that the cockpit monitoring panel had indicated that the door was closed. \nThe plane underwent tests and repair at the Guangzhou airport for about 30 minutes, SCMP reported. It took off again at around 10.30am, after 21 passengers decided not to re-board, an airline representative said. The flight landed in Bali at 2.30pm. \nAccording to SCMP, the airline is negotiating compensation with the passengers. - CNA/mn", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:11:11.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
