Now, Boone has shared art from illustrator Ashley Guillory featuring the long-rumored Maisie Williams ( Game of Thrones ) as Wolfsbane. A Scottish mutant, Wolfsbane possesses the ability to transform into a wolf or into a transitional state somewhere between human and wolf. \n— Josh Boone (@JoshBooneMovies) February 12, 2017 \nWhile Williams has yet to be confirmed by 20th Century Fox for the film, the actress previously talked to EW about the X-Men film. \n“I can’t say much about it at all, but I would absolutely love to be a part of it, [and] to be a part of the Marvel family,” Williams said. “New Mutants looks absolutely incredible and I’ve always loved the idea of spin-offs and [director] Joshua Boone is incredibly talented. So, yeah, sign me up.” \nPrevious casting rumors also pointed to Anya Taylor-Joy ( Split , The Witch ) playing Magik and Nat Wolff ( The Fault in Our Stars ) appearing as Cannonball. Dani Moonstar, aka Cheyenne/Mirage, Sunspot and Warlock will also be part of the team. \nTaylor-Joy told us earlier this year: “I have [seen the Demon Bear animatic], it’s pretty cool. I’m a big fan so I’d love to be a part of it. I can’t say very much, but I would love to be a part of it. I think this year’s gonna be very exciting.” When we asked her if she hoped to reunite with her Split co-star James McAvoy as Professor X, she replied, “I mean, I think James is already a part of it, isn’t he?” \nThe New Mutants adapts the monthly comic book series of the same name that launched in 1982. Created by Chris Claremont and Bob McLeod, The New Mutants follows on a group of teenage mutants as heroes in training in the Marvel Universe. The feature is expected to be a departure from the sci-fi-action spectacle of other X-Men films and is instead being described as a “Stephen King meets John Hughes”-style horror movie. A comparison that might make people think of this the Netflix hit series Stranger Things , albeit with even more super powers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T15:11:59.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
