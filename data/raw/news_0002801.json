'Although crystal meth is illegal, and I knew it was addictive, the thought of doing something on my own, without my family, gave me a thrill.' Mrs Neilsen explained from that moment on, getting high and its associated euphoria consumed her thoughts. From her first dalliance with the drug, smoking meth became an everyday habit for the now-44-year-old. Mum's the word: The mother of three managed to hide her $125,000 ice addiction from her family for 18 months She would skim money from her husband's business to pay for the illicit substance, and was only paying the minimum on bills for the business and family home.

'He was shocked, but he pulled me into a hug and said \"I love you, we're going to get through this\".' Mrs Neilsen has now been clean for three years. While her marriage is strong again, the family were forced to sell their house, and the mother-of-three needed a full set of false teeth. 'I still can't believe what I did - I went from model mum to meth addict,' she said.
