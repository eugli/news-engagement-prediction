Sullivan told a disciplinary hearing at the Ontario College of Teachers on Tuesday that he warned students about the risks associated with vaccines on March 9, 2015. \nSullivan denies the allegations, saying his issue is with informed consent rather than the vaccines themselves. \nThe hearing is scheduled to last two days. \nSullivan is a teacher in the Grand Erie District School Board, but the name of his school is covered under a publication ban that protects the identity of students. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:06:50.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
