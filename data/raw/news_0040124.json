Was it deliberate?\n\n(From left to right) Parthiv Patel, Yuvraj Singh, Sagarika Ghatge, Hazel Keech, Claudia Ciesla and Angad Bedi. Pic/Twitter \nIf there is one current cricketer who is known for his wit after the 'Nawab of Twitter' Virender Sehwag, it's Yuvraj Singh. Yuvi, who has made a senstational comeback to the Indian limited overs side recently against England, often takes to Twitter to pull someone's leg.\nRecently, Yuvi took to the social media platform to take a light-hearted dig at Bollywood actress Sagarika Ghatge.\n\nZaheer Khan and Sagarika Ghatge \nNow, Sagarika is rumoured to be Yuvi's former colleague Zaheer Khan's girlfriend, though both have yet to acknowledge the relationship.\nSagarika, burst on to the Bollywood scene with Shah Rukh Khan’s Chak De! India, but went quiet after that. She's back now with her new fim 'Irada'. The film which stars Naseeruddin Shah and Arshad Warsi released on February 17, and both Yuvraj and Zaheer were there in Mumbai to catch a special screening of the movie.\nYuvraj also wished Sagarika ahead of the screening. \n\nZaheer Khan, Naseeruddin Shah, Ajit Agarkar and Ashish Nehra at the special screening of 'Irada'.

The southpaw posted, \"All the best Sagarika Ghatge for tonight remember you from the days when you dated a Vice-captain of the Indian team good choice not do it in real life.\"\nAll the best @sagarikavghatge for tonight remember ufrom the days when u dated a v c of the Indian team good choice not do it in real life ðÂÂÂ pic.twitter.com/1Qq6TZ1WIh \n— yuvraj singh (@YUVSTRONG12) February 16, 2017 The newly-married cricketer was of course refering to Sagarika's character in 'Chak De! India', where she is shown dating the Vice-Captain of Indian cricket team, before dumping him.\n\nYuvraj Singh and Hazel Keech at the screening  \nWhile supposedly pulling Sagarika's leg, he ends up trolling himself since he was the vice-captain of Team India for a  lng time and known for his playboy image. Is he thus alluding to that in the tweet? We wonder if he is saying that  Sagarika is lucky that she did not date him in real life.\nSagarika replied to the tweet with a straight bat. She posted,\"I never intermingle reel with real . See you tonight.\"\nThank you @YUVSTRONG12 hahaha I never intermingle reel with real . See you tonight. https://t.co/YDnNtLuYoj \n— Sagarika Ghatge (@sagarikavghatge) February 16, 2017 But even this dig at himself seems to have made his fans swoon!\n@YUVSTRONG12 @sagarikavghatge hahahahaha aur yeh outside the off stump moving very quickly away... ðÂÂÂðÂÂÂðÂÂÂ\n— atul kasbekar (@atulkasbekar) February 16, 2017 \nWHEN ZAK AND SAGARIKA WENT TO YUVi-HAZEL'S WEDDING RECEPTION TOGETHER: \n\nZaheer Khan and Sagarika Ghatge attended Yuvraj Singh and Hazel Keech's wedding reception together", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:34:58.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
