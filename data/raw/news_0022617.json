The 19-year-old has scored just six times in 30 appearances this campaign after bursting onto the scene less than a year ago. And his manager is more than happy with his performances, despite his goalscoring drop-off.

I know that last season, in front of the goal, the goal was bigger. I know that this season the expectation is higher, the pressure is higher and the goal is shorter and he is missing some chances.' The England international has often found himself stationed on the wing instead of his favoured central position, but Mourinho believes a drop-off in output is only natural.
