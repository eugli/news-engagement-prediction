I was just stood there thinking 'what is this idiot doing?’,” Mr Jones told the Daily Mail . \n“I heard he had been drinking but I don't know why he decided to go up there. The bouncers came out and were shouting at him to get down but he just told them 'no' and carried on going.” \nAfter managing to scale more than half the building, the man attempts to turn around before he loses his grip and falls to the ground. \nMr Jones said he let out a “visceral” scream as he watched the man fall. \n“As he hit the ground there was a loud thud. We all thought he was dead,” he said. \n“He could have broken his neck of his spine. He is so lucky to be alive. I think he got away with just a broken arm and hip.” \nThe magician remains in hospital and is said to have received a lifetime ban from the magic convention. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:41:13.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
