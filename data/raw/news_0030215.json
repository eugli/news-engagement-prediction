As current events continue to challenge our country every day, many famous faces have joined in to advocate for those with lesser voices, and this year's Grammy celebration is most certainly the perfect setting for some of those issues to take center stage. In fact, producers of the annual ceremony actually encouraged artists to express their activism during their stage performances and presentations, producer Ken Ehrlich explained to Variety . “One of the tenets of our show is artistic freedom, and over the years we’ve shown we do believe in it” “How many more times do we need to hear ‘I’d like to thank my publicist, my agent, my wife and kids.’ The great acceptance speeches are ones that have a point of view and are more personal.” \nAs it turned out, there were many political moments at the 2017 Grammys , both on the red carpet and during the actual show. 1.
