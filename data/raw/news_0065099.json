Here are some of the most interesting things at the farmers market, held on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Uptown Farmers Market is a weekly farmers market on the southeast corner of Central Avenue and Bethany Home Road. It runs Wednesdays and Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. (Photo: Rachel Van Blankenship/The Republic)\n16 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Great Food Finds is an occasional series where we explore the markets that give the Valley character. This time, we're at Uptown Farmers Market in Phoenix.\nYou can take your pick of farmers markets around metro Phoenix and find tents flush with fresh vegetables, reputable food makers and good vibes.\nUptown Farmers Market is one that has an abundance of something special: parking spaces.\nThose asphalt stalls are equally as important to shoppers as they are to vendors, Uptown manager Bo Mostow said.\nUptown Farmers Market Where: Saturdays and Wednesdays at North Phoenix Baptist Church, 5757 N. Central Ave.\nSaturday hours: 9 a.m.-1 p.m. October through April; 8 a.m.-noon May to September. Moves indoors in late June or early July.\nWednesday hours: 9 a.m.-1 p.m. October through June. Closes during the summer.\nDetails: uptownmarketaz.com .\n“We have zero parking issues,” she said of the twice weekly market, held at North Phoenix Baptist Church. “Every other market is difficult to park at. They reach a point of saturation where they have to turn people away.”\nThat means disappointment for customers and lost business for vendors.\nMostow knows about these things. Not only is she a protégé of Cindy Gentry, who started the original Phoenix Public Market, Mostow is a mother of four who had trouble finding parking for her Chevrolet Suburban when she went to local markets.\n“My kids hated it,” she said of those shopping trips.\nMORE GREAT FOOD FINDS: Baiz's 99-cent bags of pita in Phoenix, Mesa | Best pretzels you’ve never had at Old Heidelberg Bakery\nMostow, 40, built a market she would want to visit in Uptown Farmers Market, in its second year at Central Avenue and Bethany Home Road.\nProduce from McClendon's Select at the Uptown Farmers Market. (Photo: Rachel Van Blankenship/The Republic)\nThe Wednesday market has about 80 vendors and the Saturday market around 140. Some vendors come both days, while others move to another local market. Wednesdays tend to be more relaxed with a smaller crowd, while Saturdays are more boisterous and attract more families.\nThe market caters to different perspectives of what local food means. Vendors run the gamut from those selling peppers, mustard greens and other vegetables grown in their backyards right here in the Valley to those who farm on dozens of acres across the state.\nOn Saturdays, shoppers get help with their kitchen prep work at the Veggie Valet, where student chefs from the Careers through Culinary Arts Program will shred your kale, julienne your carrots and chop your onions in return for a donation. C-CAP is a national non-profit that provides scholarships and training to disadvantaged youth so they can gain the skills needed to succeed in a commercial kitchen.\nIt doesn’t matter if you stop by Uptown Farmers Market on a weekday or weekend. You’ll always find a mix of Arizona farmers, food makers, kitchen craftsmen and garden gurus. And you’ll see people with dogs, strollers and tote bags.\nHere are some of the most interesting things we found at Uptown Farmers Market.\nNo-hassle payments Arizona Living Greens LLC offers a variety of fresh-cut herbs and greens at the Uptown Farmers Market. (Photo: Rachel Van Blankenship/The Republic)\nThe payment system at Uptown is a little different, too. You don’t have to carry a slip of paper around or wait in lines to pay when you’re done shopping. Instead, you purchase tokens from the informational booth at the start of your trip and use those to buy directly from vendors. Tokens come in $10 increments. If your purchase is $9, then the vendor gives you back $1. So, there’s no worry about not using the full token amount.\nYou can pay with cash anywhere, and more than half of the vendors take credit cards.\nGood to know: Also, the market accepts Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) and Women, Infants and Children (WIC) checks.\nProduce and protein McClendon’s Select brings baskets, bushels and bins filled with organic fruits and vegetables. You’ll find all the staple crops along with fun items like crimson gold apples, blood oranges, watermelon radishes, Romanesco, purple potatoes and orange cauliflower.\nAZCENTRAL\nThings To Do app: Get the best in events, dining and travel right on your device\n“McClendon is McClendon.
