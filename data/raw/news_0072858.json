On most occasions, they offer weak excuses, he said.\nIn the lady’s case, the total amount of fines was Dh9,600. \n“She said she had to drive on the hard shoulder of the road to catch up with her friend who was waiting for her in a restaurant. This is a weak excuse to avoid paying a traffic fine,” Maj-Gen Al Zafein said.\nHe said that many people approach the department with the hope that they could get the traffic fine tickets cancelled by giving any lame excuse, but he stressed that nobody is above the law in Dubai.\n“Everyone should respect the traffic law. Some drivers fabricate stories but then they apologise when we show them evidence like pictures or videos of them committing the offence.”\nIn one case, a man contested his son’s ticket claiming that his son was in Abu Dhabi when the police issued the ticket for racing and reckless driving.\nThe father was shocked when officers showed him pictures and videos of his son racing on the road. He then apologised to the police and said he did not even imagine his son would commit such traffic violations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:13:54.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
