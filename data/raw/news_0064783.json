He is said to have owned the property until his death this week, according to The Daily Mail. Describing his wife, the local resident added: “The wife was very slight and walked with a limp.“She wore full Muslim dress and never said anything. He sometimes nodded to say hello but that was about it.“I was worried that I was putting two and two together and making five, but it seems I was right all along. \n“It's a massive shock to realise what he has done and how he has killed so many people.” RIGHTMOVE One of the bedrooms at Fiddler's old house \nHowever, despite reports from the Mail that Fiddler received £1m in compensation his family have denied this and said the payout was lower.They said the £1m figure referred to a group settlement made to four ex-detainees - including al-Harith - and included their costs.In a statement they said: “The Jamal they knew up until 2001 when he was taken to Guantanamo Bay would not have become involved with a despicable organisation such as so-called IS.\"He was a peaceful and gentle person.\"Whatever he may or may not have done since then they believe from their own experience he was utterly changed by the physical and mental cruelty and the inhuman treatment he endured for two years at Guantanamo.\"The Muslim convert was detained in Afghanistan on suspicion of being an al-Qaeda fighter after US forces seized Pakistan in 2001, but he claimed he had been on a religious holiday immediately before the invasion. PH Ronald Fiddler allegedly detonated a car bomb \nHe was released after two years after US officials found he provided useful information about the Taliban’s methods. The father-of-four, who was born in Manchester, then fled to war-torn Syria. BBC journalist Steve Swann this week claimed he is the Mosul suicide bomber. \nISIS released a statement saying al-Britani had carried out an attack in Mosul. The BBC said it had seen ISIS registration papers signed by Fiddler in April 2014. Chilling footage shows a group explosive-laden death car as they drive towards an Iraqi forces base in the ISIS stronghold. Later, clouds of smoke can be seen for miles after the car drives off-screen. \nISIS later released a statement saying: “The martyrdom-seeking brother Abu Zakariya al-Britani — may Allah accept him — detonated his explosives-laden vehicle on a headquarters of the Rafidhi army and its militias in Tal Kisum village, southwest of Mosul.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:09:16.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
