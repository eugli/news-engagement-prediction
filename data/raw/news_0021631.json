Read More \nThe car was spotted by police as it travelled at about 50mph in a 30mph zone, just after midnight on November 24 last year. \nOfficers put on their lights and sirens and pursued the vehicle. \nMacCormick pulled into a pub car park and slowed down, as if to signal he would stop. \nBut prosecutor Lisa Boocock said MacCormick sped off away from the pub and ‘accelerated hard’. Mark MacCormick \nDuring the chase he drove at speeds of up to 90mph and crossed into the wrong side of the road. \nMacCormick went into a left hand bend at about 84mph, and lost control of the car. \nIt flipped onto a grass verge and collided into a telegraph pole, which snapped due to the force of the smash. \nMr Blackburne was left gravely injured but MacCormick was able to escape through the window of the car, fleeing from the scene and returning to his girlfriend’s house. \nMacCormick, of no fixed abode, handed himself into a police station later that morning. \nHe told police he couldn’t explain his actions and that he panicked and had little memory of the collision. \nTests found that he was five times the legal drug drive limit, having taken cocaine and cannabis. \nHe pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving in court last month. Declan Blackburne \nMembers of both families were in court as a packed public gallery heard the details of the incident, with Mr Blackburne’s relatives visibly emotional when following the case. \nFamily victim impact statements were not read out in court to save the upset of Mr Blackburne’s family, but judge Stuart Driver summarised them by saying: “The actions of the defendant caused the loss of one life but permanently damaged many others.” \nMacCormick, wearing grey jumpers and trousers, sat with his head bowed in the dock throughout the hearing. Read More \nDefending, Richard Vardon said that MacCormick had told his lawyer to not offer any mitigation to the court on his behalf, saying his actions were ‘unforgivable’. \nMr Vardon said: “He is genuinely ashamed he is genuinely sorry for what he has done. \n“When he left the car he didn’t know [Mr Blackburne] was in the condition he was, otherwise he would simply have not left the scene.” \nMr Vardon said that MacCormick had asked to write a letter of apology to Mr Blackburne’s family, but he was advised not to do so by his lawyers as it was deemed ‘inappropriate’. \nSpeaking to Mr Blackburne’s family in a letter he wrote to the judge, read out by Mr Vardon, MacCormick wrote: “I know there’s no words I can possibly say. It’s simply unforgivable. \n“I ask for no sympathy. I wish it was my life taken that night. I am riddled with guilt.” The crash happened on Councillor Lane on Thursday morning \nJudge Driver said there were aggravating features in the case, as MacCormick had failed to stop for police, and because he was serving a suspended sentence for a previous offence at the time. \nHe said: “Declan Blackburne was 21. He was loved and will be missed by his family. \n“The court cannot attempt to that measure that loss. \n“The sentence that will be imposed is not an attempt to do that as human life has a value which cannot be measured.” \nThe court heard Mr Blackburne gave the gift of life. \nThe judge added: “After the collision you ran away leaving your gravely injured passenger behind. \n“You handed yourself in to the police station, although at a time - in the words of the victim’s mother’s personal statement - when the net was closing in on you.” \nBefore he left court the judge paid tribute to the ‘quiet dignity’ of Mr Blackburne’s family. \nThe family were too upset to speak to the press following the hearing.
