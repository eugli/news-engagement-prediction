Given that this is a porno, Harleen and Joker’s “work” involves exactly what you think it does. \nIn addition to being a caped and costumed fuck-fest, Suicide Squad XXX actually massages canon into a seductive new shape. It’s also the most celebrated DC superhero story from 2016, by far, having won Best Actress (Kleio Valentien as Harley Quinn), Best Parody, Best Non-Sex Performance (Nyomi Banxxx as Amanda Waller), Best Three-Way Sex Scene (Kleio Valentien, Tommy Pistol & Charles Dera as Harley, Joker, and Batman), Best Art Direction, Best Director, Best Makeup , Best Screenplay, and Movie of the Year. The Enchantress in 'Suicide Squad XXX' \nTo its credit, Suicide Squad XXX massages comics canon into a more satisfying story than the film on which it’s based. The film, directed by porn parody king Axel Braun, includes characters like Poison Ivy and Killer Frost, presumably to add more female faces (and bodies) to the screen, but also in a nod to the complex roster the Suicide Squad uses in comic books. Absent are unfuckable characters like Killer Croc, and handsome leading men like Rick Flag (Alec Knight) and Captain Boomerang (Seth Gamble) are brought to the forefront. Poison Ivy in 'Suicide Squad XXX' \nThat award-winning three-way between Joker, Harley, and Batman even allows the long-standing tension between Joker and Batman to come to a head, even if it’s made sexual instead of purely antagonistic. \nWatch the full trailer for Suicide Squad XXX below. \nMORE FROM INVERSE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T11:28:41.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
