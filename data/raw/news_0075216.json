Construction is slated for completion next month. \nThe current terminal can handle 54 million passengers a year, but that is no longer enough. Four airlines will decamp to the new terminal -- Korean Air, Delta Air Lines, Air France, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. \nEach terminal will have its own traffic hub connected to subway and bus stations, parking and mooring pads for aircraft and control tower, the Incheon International Airport Corporation said. \nPassengers now have to only walk about 60 m from the nearest subway or bus station, way shorter than 230 m to Terminal 1. \nDeparture procedures will take much less time as there will be 13.2 self-service check-in counters per 10,000 passengers at Terminal 2, compared to 7.3 check-in kiosks at Terminal 1. The new terminal will also have 6.8 self-service bag drop counters per 10,000 passengers, eight times as many as Terminal 1's 0.9. \nIt will have full-body scanners capable of detecting dangerous materials such as harmful liquids and non-metal materials. If the buzzer goes off at a checkpoint, security guards have to search the passenger for another 10 seconds, but the full-body scanner does the job so flawlessly that security guards will have no need to pat people down.
