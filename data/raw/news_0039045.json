Harry Michael Norcross,\" Kirk tweeted along with a picture of himself cradling the newborn, whose curled hand and tiny ears can just about be seen peeking above a hospital blanket. \nTheir friends and fans were quick to congratulate the new parents, with one tweeting: \"Congratulations to you both!! Give Dan my love.\" \nAnother said: \"Awww loving his name! Congratulations to you and your other half!! Enjoy him.\" \nAnd a third wrote: \"What a beautiful baby boy.\" \nHowever, not everyone was happy about the news. Kirk has become a dad for the second time (Photo: Getty) \nKirk's ex-girlfriend Holli Willis, who is the mother of his other child, Violett, blasted the reality star for trying to \"up his profile\" with a picture of the baby. \n\"So you plaster your daughters picture all over media to up your profile then hide your new born son face....\" she tweeted just after Kirk announced his son's arrival. \nThe exes have been warring for months, with Kirk claiming Holli is stopping him from seeing his daughter. \nThe former TOWIE hunk recently revealed that lately he's been having trouble getting access to Violett, having shared some rare baby snaps of his little girl alongside a smattering of love-heart emojis. \nIn the adorable snaps, Kirk can see seen holding tightly onto his daughter and sporting a huge grin. \nTaking to his Twitter account previously, the star revealed his family troubles when he shared pictures of his little girl alongside a heartbreaking caption. \nHe wrote: “Miss my daughter so much!!!” alongside a sad face and a purple heart emoji. Kirk and Holli split before the birth of their child (Photo: Rex Features) \nIt wasn't the first time he'd claimed he's been unable to see his daughter. \nEarlier in January, he wrote on Twitter that a mother should \"never\" stop a dad seeing their little girl. \nKirk ranted: “Ha People commenting on stuff they no nothing about FYI a mum should never stop a dad see his daughter just because she got the Hump wid him [sic]”. \nIt seems that Holli is angry about the news that Kirk is expecting a second child with another woman . He announced the news on Instagram (Photo: Instagram/kirk_norcross) \nTaking to Twitter, the angry mum told fans she only found out about the news a MONTH ago. \nShe wrote: “So just had a bit of news via TEXT message couldn't even be man enough to tell me face to face! Your having another baby by some random! \n“Due in Feb! Couldn't even wait couple months after violett was born to start f***ing someone else”. \n“So good luck to whoever you are who is having his baby in February hope you wernt expecting much out of him![sic],\" she added. \nMirror Online has contacted Kirk for comment.
