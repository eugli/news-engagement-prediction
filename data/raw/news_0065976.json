He's a wanted man and his agent has been discussing his future. \nDembele came to everyone's attention during his spell with Fulham and his contract was coming to a finish at the end of last season. \nAt that point he was linked with some big clubs with Tottenham Hotspur adding to the Moussa Dembele's in their squad seeming like the most likely option but he ended up going to Celtic instead. \nWatch our fan footage of Celtic's infamous support: \nThe 20 year old is having a right old time in Scotland and has so far bagged himself 24 goals in all competitions including seven in the last three which itself has included back-to-back hat-tricks. \nThat will make him a wanted man once again this summer but, as reported by the Sun , his agent Mamadi Fofana said about his client's future: \n\"Moussa doesn't stress. He signed a four-year deal at Celtic and, in his head, he'll be at Celtic for those four years. \n\"If he has to leave, that will happen at the right time, but it's not in Moussa's head nor my head. In January, there was speculation, but there will always be speculation if he does well.\" \nAnd Fofana is right about their being speculation back in January. \nOn transfer deadline day the young French forward was heavily linked with a Â£40 million bid from Chelsea, helped by images of the player in London. \nHowever it transpired that he was there for medical reasons and the Blues rejected claims that they'd made a bid for the striker. \nOn Dembele's future at Celtic Park his representative added, \"We are there for the boy to become a better player , for the club to achieve more things and the club wants to keep their best players.\" \nHe's certainly likely to achieve at least one league winners medal this year and who knows what else in the future. \nEurope's elite will have to wait!
