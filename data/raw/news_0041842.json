He said: \"We will begin filming in the first week of April. The series is about the plight of a refugee family and what they go through.\nAngelina Jolie \n\"There will be appearances from actors and actresses from all over the world including Cristiano Ronaldo, Angelina Jolie and Nancy Ajram.\"\nIt can be recalled that Ronaldo helped Turkish Football Federation president Yildirim Demiroren to open his shopping mall.
