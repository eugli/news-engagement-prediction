The press wants to know Posted at 5:01 pm on February 21, 2017 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nPresident Donald Trump toured the National Museum of African American History and Culture Tuesday, a week after first lady Melania Trump visited the museum with Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israel’s prime minister. \nCNN noted that Trump’s entourage Tuesday “did not include leaders from top African-American advocacy groups such as the NAACP or the National Urban League,” but rather “several of his campaign’s top black supporters and members of his administration.” \nBut … we were assured more than once that Trump didn’t have “several” black supporters and members of his administration. Weird. \nHowever, it was up to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer to convey to White House correspondent April Ryan just what the president gained from his morning tour of the museum. Was his response awkward? Pretty much.

Yes, Trump visited the physical building that is the museum, but did he also visit slavery ? April Ryan Accuses Trump of Saying White People Made America.
