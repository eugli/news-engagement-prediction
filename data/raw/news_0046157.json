Both are highly vulnerable and Mr Corbyn admitted to MPs the seats - which have never been lost - are on a 'knife edge'. Sources close to the Labour leader blamed the problems on the party's MPs trying to remove Mr Corbyn last year. The ICM poll for The Guardian put Tories on 44 per cent nationwide and Labour on 26 per cent - one of only three occasions since 1983 the pollster has Labour so far behind The source said: 'There's obviously concern in the Labour Party at the opinion polls and has been for several months. 'And that's been the case since the leadership challenge last summer, when if you remember, Labour was in the last round of local elections last May, Labour was ahead of the Tories by one point in the actual outcome of the elections. 'And after the leadership challenge and the dissension in the Labour Party, that fell back. 'Obviously since the change of Tory leadership, the Tories have been in a stronger position. 'I think we're confident that won't continue, that Labour's position will improve in the polls and the Tories will fall back. 'I think we're now in a period which won't last, that kind of gap won't last.' Mr Corbyn's insistence the party was doing better on social media was met with fury by MPs who demanded an explanation for how the party would dig itself out of trouble The ICM poll for The Guardian put Tories on 44 per cent nationwide and Labour on 26 per cent. The Tories have enjoyed a larger lead in just three polls in this series, which dates back to 1983, said ICM. Two of these came shortly before the 1983 general election, when Michael Foot went down to a crushing defeat at the hands of Margaret Thatcher, and the other at a low-point in Gordon Brown's premiership in 2008. Labour's support was just one point above its worst ratings in the series - 25 per cent in June 2008 and August 2009. But Conservatives remain below their peak of 47.5 per cent recorded in 1983. Ukip was up one point on 13 per cent and Liberal Democrats down two on 8 per cent, while Greens were unchanged at 4 per cent.
