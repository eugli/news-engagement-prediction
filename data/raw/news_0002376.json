So be it. \nThe Fellowship of the Ring had a unique and incredible bond, one that certainly extended to the cast during the years of filming the Lord of the Rings trilogy concurrently. And it seems as though that bond is still there after more than half of that fellowship reunited —many of them for the first time since they made and promoted the films. \nDominic Monaghan shared photos of the reunion on Instagram as he, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood, and Billy Boyd readied themselves in battle position to take on that cave troll. They might not have had the bows and swords of their characters (although Bloom prepared to draw back an invisible arrow). But they were prepared.

And while some their hair has grayed a bit since the last time we saw them together, it feels like nothing has changed. Only this time around they have smartphones to document it all.
