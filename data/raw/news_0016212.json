The property abuts a rail ine that had once been considered a possible MetroLink route. Photo by Stephen Deere, sdeere@post-dispatch.com. \nCHESTERFIELD • For nearly eight years, this city has made an annual expenditure of roughly $84,000 that even some of Chesterfield’s highest-ranking officials can’t explain. \n“There was never a discussion, to my knowledge, about how this property would be used,” said Chesterfield City Administrator Mike Geisel. \nThe property is a 1.4-acre vacant gravel lot that sits next to old train tracks. Chesterfield has leased the former brickyard since 2009. \nThe city must keep making the $6,500-a-month rent payments until the 10-year lease ends in March 2019. The agreement also obligates the city to pay the property taxes, which were $7,458 last year. \nIn all, Chesterfield taxpayers will spend roughly $850,000 and receive no discernible benefit. Recently released records reveal that prior and current city officials: \n• Discussed the possibility of the property for a potential MetroLink stop or city parkland. \n• Tried to keep the lease secret by agreeing to store it at a former city attorney’s office, who, according to some council members, gave questionable advice about the deal. \n• Have unsuccessfully attempted to get out of the deal for years. \nAt the time the lease was signed, John Nations was Chesterfield’s mayor. Today, Nations is the president and chief executive of Bi-State Development, the agency that oversees the region’s Metro mass transit system. \nNations insisted in an interview that he always intended the property for parkland, believing the property could serve as a trailhead for Chesterfield’s levee trail. He said he never participated in discussions about a MetroLink stop. \nNations has long been a prominent advocate for MetroLink. In 2010, while still mayor, he ran a successful sales-tax campaign for Metro. A few months later, he resigned after being named to lead the Bi-State Development agency. \n“We greatly expanded our parks program, provided trails, the whole nine yards,” Nations said in a recent interview. “Now I left, and the city did nothing with it. That’s OK. They are entitled to take whatever action they think is appropriate. \nThe debate surrounding the property — owned by William and Marilyn Doorack — was reignited in early 2016 when a newly appointed council member discovered the lease while reviewing the city’s $41 million annual budget. \n“I really had a hard time getting my mind around the fact that the city was actually renting a useless vacant lot,” said Barb McGuinness, who was appointed to the City Council in late 2015. \nLast fall, the city attorney, Chris Graville, compiled a 323-page file of documents related to the lease. In November, the council split 4-4 about making the information public. Nations’ wife, Bridget Nations, now a Chesterfield council member, was among those voting against releasing the records. Mayor Bob Nation, no relation to John Nations, broke the tie, thus making the documents public. \nThe documents include lawyers’ correspondence and confidential memos mentioning a trailhead and a MetroLink stop as possible uses of the land. \nBoth options would have presented major obstacles. To access the levee trail from the Doorack property, the Baxter Road bridge would have to be reconfigured to accommodate pedestrians, or Chesterfield would have to build a bridge over the railroad tracks and Bonhomme Creek, Geisel said. \nEast-West Gateway, the agency that plans MetroLink’s routes, once considered the old Rock Island Railroad, which runs behind the property, as a possible route to Chesterfield. But in 2009 MetroLink was cutting back services, not expanding. ‘The appraiser is wrong’ \nAccording to a letter from former City Attorney Robert Heggie, the Dooracks approached the Sachs Properties real estate firm after they closed their brickyard. For tax reasons, the couple wanted to rent the property rather than sell it. \nBefore his death in 2012, Sachs Properties Chairman Louis Sachs had owned or developed at least 1,500 acres in Chesterfield. In the recently released file is a November 2008 letter from former Sachs Chief Executive Kathy Higgins to Nations. Sachs had negotiated a property lease with the Dooracks and was offering to assign it to the city. \nNations argued for the city to take over the lease despite advice from an appraiser that the parcel had been overvalued, according to a 2009 email . In that same email, Nations said he wanted the lease on the City Council’s agenda “while I know I have the votes.” He referenced an unidentified appraiser and that the city would have a $1 million option to purchase the property starting in 2016. \n“I think the appraiser is wrong,” Nations wrote. “… If the rental rate is good, then the $1 million is a good price. In fact, I could argue it’s undervalued.” \nBut before Chesterfield assumed the lease, Tom Smallwood, a lawyer for Sachs, had some issues. He proposed a requirement that the property be used as a “future public trail system hub, a MetroLink station and/or an express bus transit station,” according to an email from Smallwood to Heggie dated March 5, 2009. \nNations is not listed as a recipient of the email. \nThe provision never made it into the lease. But Sachs did receive “the ongoing right to review all architectural, site improvements, and landscaping plans for the Property ... and to evaluate such plans and require reasonable changes.” \nOfficials at Sachs Properties did not return phone messages for this article. Kathy Higgins, who has since retired from the firm, declined to comment. Cancel at any time \nSmallwood brought up another point in his March 2009 email: Sachs’ desire for the lease to be “legally enforceable.” A provision in the Missouri Constitution prohibits municipalities from entering into multiyear contracts. \n“Have you come up with a solution to the annual appropriation of funds issue since this is a multiyear lease?” Smallwood asked. \nOn March 6, 2009, Heggie replied , citing a Missouri Supreme Court case and arguing it allows cities to enter into multiyear contracts if they can show they have reserve funds to cover the contract. \n“Chesterfield has sufficient reserves and can certify this if needed,” Heggie wrote. A provision was then added, stating that Chesterfield certified it had enough funds in reserve to pay for the entire term of the lease. \nFive days later, Heggie said in a letter that under the agreement, the city must reassign the lease to Sachs if Chesterfield fails to pay the yearly rent. A few paragraphs later, Heggie wrote: “As indicated above, the City may, at any time, cancel the assignment of the lease and all rights therein by indicating its intention to Sachs that it wants to end the lease.” \n“We thought, ‘OK, you spend a couple of months negotiating and if it doesn’t work out, you can get out of the darn thing,” said Council Member Dan Hurt, who voted for the lease at the time. “That was the gist of what a lot of us were dealing with.” \nMoreover, Hurt said a developer had expressed interest in building a gas station on the Doorack property, which was located in an area of Chesterfield that contains historic buildings. The city planned to create a historic district there and a gas station threatened that vision. \nAs the economic recession worsened, the council had misgivings. Heggie provided them with various strategies for canceling the lease. But the recently released records — the majority of which were obtained from Heggie’s files — do not indicate that Heggie ever told the council that he instructed Sachs’ attorney how to make the lease binding on the city. \nGraville, the new city attorney, emphasized that point to the council in a closed session meeting in September, according to the minutes. \nTo some council members it seemed that Heggie’s email to Smallwood and his memo to the council — written within a few days of each other — offered contradictory legal advice. \n“I think he (Heggie) knew what he was doing,” Councilman Tom DeCampi said. \nHeggie, now a St. Louis County associate circuit court judge, told the Post-Dispatch that attorney-client privilege prevented him from discussing the lease. On Monday, the Chesterfield City Council is expected to vote on a resolution releasing Heggie from any obligations that would prevent him from publicly addressing the lease. ‘I’m going to hedge a little bit’ \nHeggie’s letter in March 2009 about the lease also mentioned a not-yet-completed appraisal. In a “frank” discussion with an appraiser, the appraiser put the lot’s value at $800,000. However, the appraiser said the $6,500 monthly rent was fair. \nBob Nation, then a council member, was out of town during a March 2009 meeting when the council voted 6-0 in closed session in favor of the lease. To him, the agreement never made sense. He continued pressing city officials for a copy of the appraisal . \nThat appraisal, however, apparently was never finished and didn’t exist. In an Oct. 2, 2009, email , Heggie told Nation the council’s unanimous vote made it unnecessary. Still, Nation kept pointing out problems with the deal. \n“This guy just flat out wears me out,” Mike Herring, then the city administrator, wrote in an email to Heggie dated Oct. 22, 2009. \nHeggie’s reply seemed to reveal a shift in his thinking about the ease with which Chesterfield could cancel the lease. \n“I’m going to hedge a little bit on what would happen if the city failed to pay the annual rent,” Heggie wrote, saying the city might have to pursue other methods if it wanted to avoid paying damages to the property owners. \nIn part because of Nation’s insistence, the city obtained an appraisal of property in 2011. The document said the 1.4-acre lot was worth $950,000. But the appraiser used the cost of the city’s lease to help arrive at the number. Typically, vacant land isn’t appraised on the income it generates but on comparable sales. \nIn closed session on Feb. 23, 2011, five council members said they believed the appraisal was performed correctly and that the city had negotiated a “GOOD DEAL,” according to meeting minutes . \nAt that meeting, Heggie was also absolutely clear about one point: How to best keep the lease details secret. \nAccording to the minutes, he recommended continuing to keep the city’s lease at his private office, “where it is protected from public scrutiny.” ‘Difficult to justify’ \nSix months later, Bruce Geiger, who was elected mayor after John Nations left for Bi-State, urged Herring to extricate the city from the agreement. \n“...it’s becoming increasingly difficult to justify the $84,000/year ($7,000 a month????) ...,” Herring wrote in an email to Heggie after speaking with Geiger. \nAs the city explored its options, Heggie repeatedly warned that defaulting on the lease would damage Chesterfield’s credit and result in expensive litigation. \nWhen the city couldn’t convince the Dooracks to renegotiate, Chesterfield employed its regulatory power as a negotiating tactic, telling the Dooracks the city would rezone their land from “commercial” to “parks and scenic,” a move that would reduce its value. In an email to Heggie, Herring referred to the action as a “threat.” The city followed through with the rezoning in 2015. \nLater that year, McGuinness asked Herring for a copy of the budget a few days before taking her oath. Herring was reluctant. Council members never received the full budget, he said in an email. He offered to meet with her to answer questions. \n“Nearly impossible to ask questions without detailed info,” McGuinness responded. McGuinness wouldn’t relent. Her persistence eventually led the city to order a new appraisal . \nThat appraisal assumed the parcel could be rezoned back to commercial status, relied on comparable sales and provided an estimated value far lower than any the city had ever received: $400,000.
