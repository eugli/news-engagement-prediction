Immigrants from major cities are staying home from work and school as part of a strike to show the impact of immigrants on the nation. The protests intend to be a response to President Trump's travel ban and controversial comments regarding Mexico. More than a dozen restaurant's in the country's capital has already announced closings for the day.\nMedia: MediaOS Video The \"very smooth roll out\" of President Trump's travel ban, of which the President boasted at a Thursday news conference, was followed later in the day by a legal brief saying the White House will \"rescind\" the ban.\nThe executive order has taken a battering in federal courts, its implementation halted by a Seattle judge's restraining order that was later upheld by a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\nAfter the Trump administration's latest filing, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson claimed victory in the state's legal challenge to the ban.\n\"Let's be clear: Today's court filing by the federal government recognizes the obvious -- the President's current Executive Order violates the Constitution,\" Ferguson said.\"President Trump could have sought review of this flawed order in the Supreme Court but declined to face yet another defeat.\"\nAnybody who missed the movie \"Twister\" could find a substitute in the gyrations of the Trump administration on Thursday.\nThe president, in a long, rambling news conference, denounced the 9th Circuit for its \"incorrect and unsafe ruling\" and declared, without a scintilla of evidence, that the San Francisco-based appellate court is \"in chaos.\"\nRelated Stories Seattle 'Dreamer' protected by Obama jailed, faces deportation Supreme Court: Florist can't discriminate against gay customers AG Ferguson: 'The future of the Constitution is at stake' \"We had a very smooth roll out of the travel ban,\" Trump claimed. A moment later, however, he declared: \"We're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country.\"\nIn the meantime, Justice Department lawyers, on behalf of Trump, were telling the court in a filing that: \"The President intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised Executive Order\" to eliminate constitutional concerns.\nThe promise to rescind flies in the face of Trump's Twitter braggadocio minutes after the 9th Circuit ruled last week: \"We'll see you in court.\" The President subsequently predicted that the administration would prevail.\nThe travel crackdown executive order, including a ban on persons from seven predominately Muslim nations entering the U.S., caused chaos at American airports.\nThe state of Washington, with support from more than 100 major corporations, sued on January 30 to block it -- and was joined by the state of Minnesota.\nThe states have argued that Trump's Executive Order violates the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of Equal Protection and the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, infringes on individuals' constitutional rights to Due Process, and is discriminatory toward Muslims.\nPublic statements by Trump, before and after he became President, have substantially bolstered the states' case.\nU.S. District Judges James L. Robart -- referred to by Trump as a \"so-called judge\" -- determined that Washington was likely to prevail on the merits of its case. He issued an injunction preventing enforcement of the Executive Order across the country.\nThe 9th Circuit panel upheld Robart's decision.\nThe ball is back in the hands of the White House who fumbled it.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/57/06/30/12346925/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/57/06/25/12346704/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/02/34/37/640971/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=1x4&iu=/36117602/hnp-beaumontenterprise.com/Video&ciu_szs=300x250,728x90&cust_params=video_player%3Dmediaos&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&url=%5Breferrer_url%5D&description_url=%5Bdescription_url%5D&correlator=%5Btimestamp"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:59:43.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
