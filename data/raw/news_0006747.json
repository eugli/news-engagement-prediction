'But when you're fifth [sixth] in the league, you're not in the Champions League positions and you're fighting... 'Until you're winning, that's when you go out and do stuff like that. 'I've dug out Arsenal players for doing stuff like this before and it would be wrong of me to not talk about the United players.' Ferdiand admits that the outgoing manner is part of Pogba's charm at United, secured their place in the EFL Cup final at the end of last month, and will face Southampton at Wembley on February 26. But the 38-year-old who lifted the Champions League alongside six league titles, an FA Cup and three EFL Cups during his time at Old Trafford, believes the showboating should be saved for more appropriate occasions. Rio Ferdinand has slammed Pogba and Lingard for their celebration video on social media 'I'm all for having fun, and I think part of Pogba's appeal is that he's a happy free spirit - which I wouldn't want to take anything away from - but there's a time and getting the balance right. 'If that footage comes out after you've won a cup final, or a league - I'd be the first one to be pushing it out. 'But if it was me, I'd be thinking \"we're fifth [United are currently sixth] in the league, we're fighting for a Champions League position, we haven't got our hands on any silverware yet\" - I'd want to keep myself under the radar a little bit.'
