I wish you enough happiness to know that the world is good, even on the days when it feels wild and crazy and so far from beautiful. \nI wish you enough hands to hold and lips to kiss so that you learn the meaning of love. \nI wish you enough heartbreak, so that you realize the true love you deserve. \nI wish you enough loneliness so that you become independent and start loving yourself. \nI wish you enough confidence so that you are capable, but not conceited. \nI wish you enough love so that you understand the meaning and significance of it, and so that when you’re ready for it, you aren’t scared to fall in. \nI wish you enough laughter so that you learn to slow down and appreciate the people and things around you. \nI wish you enough disappointment so that you never lose sight of all that you have. \nI wish you enough pain so that you learn to stand on your own two feet and to trust God. \nI wish you enough toughness to sustain through the hard days, and enough frailty to learn your own limits. I wish you enough softness to forgive, and enough resilience to begin again. \nI wish you enough trials so that you learn who you are and who you will become. \nI wish you enough success so that you are proud of the skin you stand in. \nI wish you enough loss so that you never take what you have for granted. \nI wish you enough gain so that you are both humble and thankful. \nI wish you enough stability so that you trust the world around you and the people in it, but enough change so that you are always growing. \nI wish you enough love, enough life, enough purpose, enough brokenness, enough wholeness, so that your life is imperfect and beautiful and blessed. \nI do not wish you flawlessness or perfection—I wish you a life worth living. A life with ups and downs, trials and triumphs, growth and beginnings and endings and lessons and love. \nI wish you enough.
