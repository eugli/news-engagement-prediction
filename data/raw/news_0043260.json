He said \"it's kind of surreal\" to be sharing Canada's highest honour in football with people at home.\n\"It's nice to be able to come home and show people that supported me and helped me through my career what it all culminates to and what you can do when you have people behind you,\" said Albright.\nNathan Horton, 10, holding the Grey Cup Saturday morning in Bedford. (Allison Devereaux/CBC)\nThe Ottawa Redblacks won the cup back in November in overtime against the Calgary Stampeders.\n\"I think somewhere in the middle of the off-season when you're training, it just finally sets in that we won,\" said Albright.\nEach team member and staff gets to show off the cup for about 36 hours.\nAlbright's stops with the cup included the IWK Health Centre and Saint Mary's University. He said people are shocked to see its condition.\n\"People have been awesome. They're really supportive and just excited to see it overall. I think a lot of people are surprised to see how beat up it is,\" he said.\n'True Canadian moment'\nShea Lenehan, a fan, got to see the cup for the first time Saturday at ProEdge.\n\"It's just pretty neat seeing what football players have worked toward earning their whole lives,\" he said. \"It's actually a little more beat up than I expected.\"\nOttawa Redblacks offensive lineman Matt Albright at ProEdge Saturday afternoon.
