( supplied ) By Andrej Ivanov Staff Reporter Tues., Feb. 14, 2017 Veteran Canadian TV personality Jennifer Valentyne has joined Q107’s Derringer in the Morning show. Veteran host John Derringer alluded big news was coming to Q107’s morning show via Twitter on Saturday. He delivered the news right off the bat on his Valentine’s Day broadcast. Or in this case, Valentyne’s day broadcast. Former Live Eye veteran Valentyne is joining Derringer, Ryan Parker and John Garbutt, weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. “I think Toronto listeners will be surprised to a see a whole new side of me,” Valentyne said in a statement. On today’s show, she pointed out that “this is the only job I applied for,” adding that she had to build a resume and apply for the position. Article Continued Below Derringer said that since Valentyne got the job on Jan. 1 after interviewing in October, but the station decided it would be appropriate to have her first show on Valentine’s Day. The trick would not have worked as well if she had applied in August, Derringer joked. Derringer and Valentyne both expressed a deep appreciation for each other’s work. “Jennifer is the perfect fit to round out our existing all-star team,” said Blair Bartrem, senior brand director for Q107. “We’ve been searching for our very own Elaine to join our Seinfeld-like cast of characters and now we’ve found her.” Valentyne left Breakfast Television’s Live Eye in April 2016, after 23 years on the City network show. She then went on to host The Bachelorette Canada After Show on the W Network. This is not the first time Valentyne has been on the radio. She was the Cash Car Girl on Key590 while attending the Centennial College Radio and Television Broadcasting program.
