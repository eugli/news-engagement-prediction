If your special someone is truly special, they'll appreciate these David Cronenberg Valentine's Day cards far more. The cards — which appear to be a real product produced and sold in the early ‘90s — feature Valentine's Day platitudes taken to their literal extreme courtesy of shocking stills from the director's extensive repertoire of horror films. \nThese are just a few of our favorites, from Scanners (1981), Videodrome (1983), and Dead Ringers (1988), but there's a total of 23 body horror cards for you to peruse . The creepy cache of Valentine's Day cards were found by a couple of friends cleaning out an abandoned storage unit in Hollywood. They say they decided to scan them all and compile them on a website so you could easily send them to your Valentine. So what are you waiting for? \nThanks, Samantha!
