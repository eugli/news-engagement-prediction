If the Aussies can do that then we will have a chance. The guys need to stay calm under pressure.” Waugh in his playing days. Source: Supplied \nAshwin has 11 Tests to beat Lillee to 300 wickets, which would lock up another record for the outstanding off-spinner. \n“The way he is playing at the moment, he is going to break a number of records,” Waugh added. \n“Ashwin’s statistics are just mind-boggling.” \nWaugh was cautious in responding to Sourav Ganguly’s taunt that Australia would leave Indian shores without a win. \n“It’s foolish to write (Australia) off like that,” he said. \n“I think anything can happen. India hasn’t seen a lot of our players. \n“I believe (Mitchell) Starc is the best quick bowler in the world and (Josh) Hazlewood is right up there. \n“The spinners — the jury’s out a bit there but (Nathan) Lyon is a very good competitor. \n“Sourav is a bit optimistic and I’ll challenge him on that. Certainly, Australia won’t be going to India thinking that they will lose four-nil.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:16:46.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
