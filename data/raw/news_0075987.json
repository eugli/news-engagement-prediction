Given the Celtics’ inactivity at the deadline, it’s hard to imagine they will overtake the Cavaliers as the No. 1 seed come playoff time. However, if Love’s knee injury turns out to be more serious than expected, things could change. \nBoston will host Cleveland on March 1. \nThumbnail photo via Jeff Hanisch/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:14:24.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
