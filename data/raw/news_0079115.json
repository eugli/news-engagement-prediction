She's not a quitter. She's a senior. She's fought for the last three years to get here. \n\"She was going to see it through even though I wasn't sharing the same opinion.\" 'We just want to wrestle' \nAbout a week ago, Beggs won a regional championship after a female wrestler from a Dallas-area high school forfeited the final. \nNancy Beggs, the wrestler's grandmother, told the Dallas Morning News after the forfeit: \"Today was not about their students winning. Today was about bias, hatred and ignorance.\" \nThe parent of another girl filed a lawsuit trying to block Beggs, saying his use of testosterone increases his strength and could pose a risk to opponents. External Link: Tweet by @TheChrisMosier: \"When Mack goes out to wrestle, save your boos for the Texas superintendents, 95% of whom thought this was a good policy for trans athletes.\" \nAfter his victory, Beggs told reporters he wanted the focus of Saturday's championship to be on his teammates rather than him. \n\"The hard work that I put in the practice room with them beside me … I would not be here without them,\" Beggs said, backed by his team and wearing a gold medal around his neck. \nHe also addressed the controversy on Facebook on February 19, writing he was \"sick and disgusted\" over the discrimination shown by parents and coaches. \n\"These kids don't care who you put in front of them to wrestle,\" he wrote. \n\"We just want to wrestle. They are taking that away from me and from the people I'm competing with.\" Photo: Beggs, his family, and many of his opponents want him to wrestle males. (AP: Nathan Hunsinger/The Dallas Morning News) Win comes after Trump revokes bathrooms rights \nThis was a sentiment echoed by triathlete Chris Mosier, who was the first transgender athlete to represent America. \nHe wrote on Twitter: \"Mack Beggs is a just kid who wants to compete in the sport he loves. Texas gave him two options: wrestle with girls or quit. He wrestles.\" \nMosier is also the founder of transathlete.com, which provides information for transgender athletes. \nAccording to the website, Texas is one of seven US states with policies it sees as discriminatory against transgender athletes. \nBeggs' win came days after the Trump administration revoked landmark guidance to public schools letting transgender students use the bathrooms of their choice , reversing a signature initiative of former Democratic president Barack Obama. \nReversing the guidelines stands to inflame passions in the conflict in the US between believers in traditional values and those advocating for LGBTQ rights. \nAP/ABC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:22:48.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
