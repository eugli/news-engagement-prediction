Had the posters read Le Dernier Jedi, L'ultimo Jedi and El Ultimo Jedi, Mark Hamill's Luke would have been even further up on the endangered list. Grammar wars: The debate was settled on Friday when Disney's French (L), Italian (R) and Spanish Star Wars Twitter accounts posted pictures of the new logo You are not alone: Had the posters read Le Dernier Jedi, L'ultimo Jedi and El Ultimo Jedi, Mark Hamill's Luke would have been even further up on the endangered list The revelation seems to contradict both Yoda and the opening crawl of The Force Awakens, which both referred to Luke - singularly - as 'the last Jedi'. Some fans hoped - as Yoda once did - that Leia Organa might too have fulfilled her Force potential and become a Jedi; indeed this may have even been part of the upcoming plot, were it not for the tragic and untimely death of actress Carrie Fisher. The question now remaining is who indeed are these Last Jedi, with Luke and Daisy Ridley's Rey being the prime suspects. Another Skywalker: Some fans hoped - as Yoda once did - that Leia Organa might too have fulfilled her Force potential and become a Jedi; indeed this may have even been part of the upcoming plot, were it not for the tragic and untimely death of actress Carrie Fisher Teaser: Since director Rian Johnson revealed the title of the penultimate episode last month, Star Wars buffs have been racking their brains trying to figure out whether the titular Jedi - which is the same word singular and plural - meant the ancient Order was down to one 'Felt so good to drop this': Johnson shared first look at The Last Jedi's opening crawl last month A return to the Light Side for Adam Driver's Kylo Ren AKA Ben Solo looks unlikely to be accepted by fans after he mercilessly skewered his father, the beloved Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford in the last film. However Kylo's granddad Darth Vader / Anakin Skywalker seemed to have been welcomed back despite massacring countless Jedi to the point of extinction, including dozens of children. As well as Driver, Ridley, Hamill and the late Fisher, The Last Jedi will see the return of John Boyega, Lupita Nyongâ€™o, Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Gwendoline Christie, and Andy Serkis. New cast members will include Benicio Del Toro, Laura Dern, and newcomer Kelly Marie Tran. The Last Jedi - which picks up immediately where The Force Awakens left off - is scheduled for release on December 15. Who is it?
