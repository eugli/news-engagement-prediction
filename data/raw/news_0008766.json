Christina Hall , Detroit Free Press 4:03   Lady Gaga says she's been preparing for her Super Bowl halftime performance since she was four. (Photo: TANNEN MAURY, EPA) \nMore Lady Gaga watching and less toilet flushing in central Macomb County during halftime of Sunday's Super Bowl. \nWell, that's not exactly what County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller encouraged today, but she is urging residents in 11 communities impacted by the Dec. 24 sewer interceptor collapse and sinkhole in Fraser to restrict water usage. \nThat means during the big game and what is known -- either in reality in some places or urban legend in others -- as \"The Big Flush.\" \nLots of people flushing toilets might not be a big deal for most sewer systems, but Macomb County officials aren't taking any chances given that they're dealing with a sinkhole the size of a football field along 15 Mile that displaced 23 residences and condemned three homes. \nRelated: Some may pay for Fraser sinkhole for 25 years \n\"We are going to be monitoring it. We're hoping we're gonna be OK. We're not sure,\" Miller said. \nShe said contractors at the Fraser sinkhole site who also repaired a 2004 sinkhole on 15 Mile in Sterling Heights remember a usage spike during halftime of the big game. So this year officials aren't tempting fate, especially since the small space that was open for flow in the 11-foot-wide interceptor recently became blocked by shifting sediment. \nA permanent sewage bypass isn't expected to be in place until the end of the month or the beginning of March. Miller said officials are evaluating whether they will hook up with Mt. Clemens, which operates its own wastewater treatment facilities, to take some of the flow. She said the hookup alone with Mt. Clemens is estimated to cost about $500,000, then there is the cost of treatment -- a cost that would have to be picked up by ratepayers in the 11 communities. \n\"We have not made the final decision,\" she said today on the Mt. Clemens hook-up. \nBut, she said, officials have decided they will be monitoring Sunday's flow \"all the time\" to make sure there isn't a rush in the system, especially during halftime. \nToo much flow or too much rain or melting snow could force officials to discharge raw sewage into the Clinton River, which eventually flows to Lake St. Clair in Harrison Township. There is disinfectant ready to go in a half-dozen places should a discharge be required. Officials had to discharge once in December, but they don't want to have to do it again. \nA discharge is not something those running the Facebook page \"Save Lake St. Clair\" want, either. On Tuesday, it posted a photo of the lake from around Jefferson and Shook with the caption: \"It looked like sewage and smelled like sewage.\" \nMiller said she believes some of the material in the photo was from the December discharge. She admitted: \"it's gross.\" \nPatricia Burlock, who has lived in Harbor Club South Apartments along the lake near the river's spillway for 16 years, said it's \"just nasty stuff\" in the water. She said when spring and summer hit and the wind blows the right way, the smell is so bad \"it makes you wanna throw up.\" \nThe \"Save Lake St. Clair\" Facebook post urged residents to conserve as much water as possible starting today through Sunday and stated: \"This upcoming Super Bowl Sunday we are in for a massacre on our Lake,\" adding that Super Bowl Sunday is the \"APEX\" for water usage, citing more dishwasher usage and bathroom flushing because of parties and drinking. \n\"When its brown flush it down, if its yellow let it mellow,\" according to the Facebook post. \"Every gallon counts.\" \nThe 11 communities being asked to restrict water usage are the cities of Fraser, Utica and Sterling Heights, the village of New Haven, the townships of Chesterfield, Clinton, Harrison, Lenox, Macomb, Shelby and Washington and Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township. \nHomeowners in these communities learned this week they may have to pay, on average, about $40 more annually in their sewer bills for the next quarter-century if officials issue a $150-million bond to pay for the repairs and a long-term fix to the large interceptor line. \nThat's if the county can't obtain federal and state funds. To help bring in funding, the county and the state have declared states of emergency for the county. \nToday, the state announced that impacted communities can apply for up to $100,000 in state grants to help cover the costs associated with their response to the sinkhole, including overtime for public employees, contracts, shelter supplies, gasoline and repair of public buildings and roads. \nGov. Rick Snyder opened the Disaster and Emergency Contingency Fund to provide financial help to the affected jurisdictions. State statute allows the governor to authorize reimbursement from the fund to provide state assistance to counties and municipalities when federal emergency reimbursement is not available. \nSnyder declared a state of emergency for the county and Clinton Township, making state resources available. Earlier this week, the state legislature approved extending the state declaration through March 31, a resolution Snyder's office said he would sign. \nNext week, county commissioners are expected to discuss extending the county emergency declaration from Feb. 9 into March. \nContact Christina Hall: .
