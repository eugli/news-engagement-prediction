Garrett even gave the dog a name, calling her Sophie.\nWhen she went to pick up the puppy on Jan. 30 at the home where she saw the litter, she said no one answered the door. She and her husband returned one day later and there was still no one home.\nGarrett said a neighbour and landlord told her the seller had moved out.\n“I go ‘oh my god there went my deposit, there went my dog,’” said Garrett. “So I messaged her [the seller] and said ‘what’s going on’. No reply.”\n“I said ‘am I getting my dog’ and that was it, I never heard back.”\nShe's now out $400 and doesn't have a dog, but what Garrett's more worried about is the well-being of the litter of pugs she saw in the home.\n“I’m upset, I’m really upset about it,” Garrett said. “Who’s to say where these dogs are now.”\nGarrett and her daughter Tara said they contacted Winnipeg police but said her daughter was told there wasn't much officers could do.\n“Everybody’s past the money part, it’s about are the puppies safe,” Tara Garrett added.\nThe Garrett’s have also contacted a veterinarian where the seller said the puppies were going to get their shots. They said they’ve also reached out to other veterinarians to be on the lookout for any pug puppies.\nManitoba Pug Rescue executive director Lisa Chorneychuk said there are very few pug puppies in Manitoba and they're in very high demand.\nChorneychuk isn't aware of this latest report of a scam, but knows of other online scams where people have put down a deposit on a pug they didn't see in person and never got the dog or their money back.\n\"It's very disheartening,\" Chorneychuk said. \"I'd be very concerned as to where those puppies are.\"\nThe Winnipeg Police Service said it's not aware of any ongoing investigations regarding pug scams.\nA spokesperson for Manitoba's Chief Veterinary Office wasn't immediately aware of any complaints about the well-being of pugs in Winnipeg, but the office is looking further into the matter.\nCTV News reached out to the seller by phone and visited the home where Garrett saw the pug, but our call wasn’t answered and no one answered the door at the house where Garrett said she saw the pugs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:48:19.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
