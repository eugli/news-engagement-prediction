IndiaToday.in | Written by Ranit Das Azhar Ali stepped down as the ODI captain 2 Sarfraz will replace him as the ODI captain 3 Pakistan have only won five out of ten bilateral series under Azhar \nPakistan's T20 captain Sarfraz Ahmed has been appointed as the new One Day International (ODI) captain. The wicketkeeper-batsman replaces Azhar Ali, who was handed the job back in March, 2015. \nThe decision was taken after Azhar informed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan in a meeting in Dubai that he will step down as the captain of the national team. \nAzhar has been under fire after senior Pakistan cricketers including former wicketkeeper Moin Khan questioned his role as the ODI skipper. Moin backed Sarfraz for the job after his impressive performances for Pakistan. \nPakistan slipped to a record-low ninth in the ODI rankings under Azhar's leadership. The situation is so bad that Pakistan might also fail to earn direct qualification for the 2019 World Cup. \nPakistan have only won five out of ten bilateral series under Azhar. Two of them have come against Zimbabwe and one each against Ireland, Sri Lanka and West Indies. Pakistan have won 12 and lost 18 games under him. \nAs captain, Azhar has scored only two half-centuries and one hundred in his last 23 innings. In the recently-concluded ODI series against Australia where Pakistan lost 1-4, he had scores of 24, 7 and 6 in his three appearances. It was Pakistan's second one-day series defeat in the last five months having first lost to England.
