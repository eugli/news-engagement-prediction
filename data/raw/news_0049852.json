Photo: Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images President Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, recently hand-delivered a sealed “peace plan” to the White House outlining a way to remove the U.S. sanctions on Russia, a plan that was conceived by a pro-Putin Ukrainian lawmaker connected to Cohen by a Trump business associate with links to the mafia. This is all according to a new report published by the New York Times on Sunday. The plan was apparently delivered to the desk of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn one week before he was forced to resign over having allegedly had, and lied about, a discussion about U.S. sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\nIt is not clear if the plan was ever even opened after being delivered to the White House, or if the plan’s proponents have discussed the plan with Trump or anyone else in the administration. The Times describes the group behind the plan as amateur diplomatic freelancers, and while this is obviously a lot more smoke in the already murky story regarding Team Trump’s possible connections to Russia, the new report alleges no wrongdoing regarding the scheme.\nThe Times explains that the wealthy Ukrainian lawmaker who came up with the plan, Andrii V. Artemenko, “sees himself as a Trump-style leader of a future Ukraine” and claims to have corruption evidence that can bring down current Ukrainian president Petro O. Poroshenko (in order to replace him with someone who is less hostile to Russia and thus amenable to Artemenko’s peace plan). Artemenko also claims that top Putin aides have encouraged his plans, but the Ukrainian government is already disavowing Artemenko’s efforts; they say that he was not authorized to present any such plan to a foreign government.\nUkrainian political efforts to oppose Poroshenko were in part developed by former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who left the campaign after his varied connections to Russia-aligned leaders in Ukraine were exposed back in August. Manafort and Artemenko have apparently never met. Poroshenko has been fighting a war against Russia-backed separatists in Eastern Ukraine since replacing his ousted pro-Russia predecessor, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014. (And Manafort used to work for Yanukovych.)\nThe Times and Politico also report that Artemenko met with Trump campaign officials after he traveled to Cleveland for last summer’s Republican National Convention. The Times adds that the lawmaker, who apparently considers himself the Trump of Ukraine, says that “he saw in Mr. Trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in Ukraine — and help advance his own political career.”\nThe other players in the story are: Trump’s special counsel, Cohen, a top Trump Organization lieutenant with business and familial ties to Ukraine who is currently under investigation by the FBI over his possible connections to the Kremlin; and Felix Sater, a Russian-American businessman with a decade of experience working with the Trump Organization who once pled guilty in a mafia-linked stock-manipulation scheme and became a government informant. Sater, who has also done time for stabbing a man in the face with the stem of a margarita glass, has said in the past that he and Trump were close. Trump has denied that.\nA mutual friend apparently introduced Artemenko to Sater and they then involved Cohen. The three men allegedly worked on the deal at a Manhattan hotel in late January. Now, Artemenko is hoping the next national-security adviser, whomever that is, will consider the plan after joining the Trump administration.\nA controversial and unverified dossier assembled by a former British intelligence agent alleged that Cohen had discussed Russia’s hacking of Democratic Party computer systems with a Russian official in Prague during Trump’s campaign, but Cohen and the Russian official have both denied that allegation. Sater had apparently been working on a plan for a Trump Tower in Moscow that was halted on account of Trump’s presidential campaign. Talking Point Memo’s Josh Marshall, for what it’s worth, thinks Sater’s inclusion in the report is a very big deal , since Sater was at the center of the Trump Soho development project in Manhattan, which Marshall notes was the Trump project with the most Russia-linked shadiness.\nTags: donald trump michael cohen russia ukraine politics andrii artemenko felix sater wtf More Trump’s Lawyer Involved With Plan to Lift Russian Sanctions Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories More White House Chaos Over Anti-Immigrant Policy Draft Paul Ryan’s Dream of Tax Cuts for the Rich Will Not Be Denied Andrew Sullivan: The White House Mole Most Viewed Stories John McCain the Republican vs. John McCain the Patriot The White House Mole Sweden Confused After Trump Conflates Fox News Segment With Terrorist Incident The ‘Blacks for Trump’ Guy Is a Former Member of a Murderous Cult Who Thinks Obama Is the Devil This Finnish Word Makes Your Sad Weekend Plans Sound a Little Cooler Airplane Passenger Reportedly Called Police After Feeling ‘Not Comfortable’ Sitting Next to Mykki Blanco Report: Senior National Security Council Aide Fired After Criticizing Trump Late Night’s Best Jokes About Trump’s Instantly Infamous Press Conference Larry Wilmore and Milo Yiannopoulos Spar on Real Time: ‘You Can Go F*ck Yourself’ Why Your Dog’s Personality Is a Lot Like Yours Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer The Wildest Moments From Donald Trump’s Press Conference Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 8:34 p.m. Report: Trump’s Lawyer Involved With Secret Plan to Lift Russian Sanctions The other two people involved with the plan were a pro-Putin Ukrainian lawmaker and a Trump business associate with links to the mafia.\n5:45 p.m. Sweden Confused After Trump Cites Nonexistent Terrorist Incident Trump’s fake Swedish news reflects a misleading right-wing narrative about refugee-perpetrated crime.\n5:13 p.m. McCain Keeps Criticizing Trump, Warns Against Attacks on Press He warned that suppressing the media is “how dictators get started,” though he mostly avoided direct references to the president.\nYesterday at 11:26 p.m. Trump Attempts Reset With Recycled Campaign Stump Speech in Florida Trump has already chosen his 2020 opponents: the press and any version of reality that doesn’t come from him.\nYesterday at 6:18 p.m. Senior National Security Council Aide Fired After Criticizing Trump Meanwhile, Trump is still looking for his next national-security adviser.\nYesterday at 3:33 p.m. Trump’s Presidency ‘Enhances’ a $200,000 Mar-a-Lago Membership But the White House insists nobody is getting enhanced access to the president.\nYesterday at 9:00 a.m. John McCain the Republican vs. John McCain the Patriot The senator (ambivalently, agonizingly) takes on the president.\n2/17/2017 at 4:39 p.m. Upper East Side Parents Are the Latest Trump Resisters An elite school allegedly had to cancel a field trip to the Central Park’s Trump-affiliated Wollman Rink.\n2/17/2017 at 4:10 p.m. More White House Chaos Over Anti-Immigrant Policy Draft The Associated Press has a draft of a memo that suggests deploying as many as 100,000 National Guard troops.\n2/17/2017 at 3:19 p.m. Senate Confirms Leading Opponent of Environmental Regulation As Head of the EPA Scott Pruitt will spearhead the Trump administration’s efforts to increase water pollution and accelerate man-made climate change.\n2/17/2017 at 2:54 p.m. R.I.P.
