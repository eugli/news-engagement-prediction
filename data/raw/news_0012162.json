I just try to do my best when I'm out on the pitch and show everyone the level of how good I am.\nLiam Henderson side-foots home the opener for the away side at McDiarmid Park\nCeltic recovered after trailing thanks to David Wotherspoon's shot deflecting into the net\n'It's easy not to get distracted. I'm a very calm kind of guy and I don't really let this type of thing get in my head. I focus only on enjoying my football at Celtic and I'm very happy to be here.\n'It is (flattering) and it motivates me to keep doing well. I'm happy to be here and I hope to be here as long as I can.'\nFor a brief moment on Tuesday, when pictures of Dembele on a flight to London surfaced on social media, Celtic fans feared the worst.\nThe Frenchman now admits he was fully aware of the agony they were going through until his colourful Tweet put their minds at rest.\n'I was, obviously, because I received a lot of texts but I just went there for a scan on my knee,' he smiled.\n'I had a bit of fun with it, it's the best way. There's no need to speak when you see the picture! I know Chelsea's stadium because I was in London for years, but I didn't pass it when I was there - I just went straight for my scan and then back to the airport.'\nDembele fires home the penalty to make it 2-2 and the Frenchman wasn't finished there\nThe striker reproduced the same 'Wolf of Wall Street' celebration that implied he was staying\nThere were certainly no signs of any ill effects at McDiarmid Park.\nAsked if the penalty conversion was his first touch, Dembele confirmed it was, adding: 'Was there pressure? Yes. I'm a striker so I'm used to it and when I get the chance I'm confident of scoring because it is what I have been doing all my life.'\nThat's 23 for the season now. With 14 league games to go and as many as four in the Scottish Cup, 30 seems a reasonable expectation if not more.\n'My target is in my head and I'm not telling you about it but I'll try to go beyond the target I have,' he added.\nCeltic's targets are easier to pin down. Now 27 points clear, the record 29-point margin of victory in the modern era looks well within their grasp.\nEclipsing Paris Saint Germain's 31-point European record is no longer out of the question.\nFor the former PSG kid, that would have a certain ring to it.\n'Yes, but before that we have to win many games and keep performing as well as we can, and then we'll see after that.\nThe record 29-point margin of victory in the modern era looks well within Celtic's grasp\nScott Sinclair fires home his side's fourth goal as Celtic recorded their 23rd league victory\n'I was not aware of the record but we have a great chance to beat it. We have to think game by game and afterwards we will see.'\nFor Brendan Rodgers, there was never any question that the events of the past week would have any negative influence on his star man.\n'It doesn't affect him,' he said. 'He is at a club he wants to be at and you see the difference when you have a No 9. I think he can get to 30 goals. We still have a lot of games and we create a lot of chances.\n'That was the objective when I came in to be attack-minded. If he puts the chances away then he should do.'\nReflecting on the win that put his side 27 points clear at the top, Rodgers added: 'I thought our composure in the game was very good.\n'We stay calm in pressure moments and I thought our build up play was good.\n'Our positioning was good and we could have been more aggressive in our pressing in the first half. But after the break we upped it and were far more dynamic. Our fitness was also a major factor and we wore St Johnstone down because we have them super-fit in the mind.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:47:54.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
