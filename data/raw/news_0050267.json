Now the team is trying to save the season and patch up the rest of the roster. Frank Kaminsky (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 1:30 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 1:30 p.m. ET \nBack in late January, Hornets big man Frank Kaminsky was summoned by his head coach, Steve Clifford. Kaminsky had come off a stretch of four games in which he scored only 23 total points. All year, Clifford had been waiting, hopeful that Kaminsky would begin to cash in his potential as a scorer, something his flailing team needs badly. \nKemba Walker is the Hornets’ No. 1 option. The team has pretty much given up on Nic Batum assuming the role of No. 2 scorer. Clifford knew Kaminsky had to get more aggressive, and told him so. \n“I think it was before the Portland game on our road trip,” Kaminsky told Sporting News. “(Clifford) sat me down and had a talk with me about approach, what I should be doing, what I was doing before and what needs to change. I have just tried to do that as much as I can. I just made a more concerted effort to be ready for every single game, every situation. It has been going well for me so far, but we need to get back to winning games.” \nMORE: Latest in NBA trade rumors \nIndeed, since that game in Portland on January 31, Kaminsky has averaged 16.1 points, struggling at times with his shot (he is shooting 42.9 percent in that stretch) but accepting Clifford’s insistence that he be more selfish on the offensive end. \nClifford is hoping that Kaminsky continues to be assertive in the second half. He’s been frustrated at times this year, but acknowledged that Kaminsky is only in his second NBA season, and was set back this summer by lung surgery that kept him from working on his body. \n“I think it is a growing thing,” Clifford told SN. “I think also you’ve got to remember he missed close to seven-and-a-half weeks this summer when he had to have the procedure done. I think that hurt him, particularly the conditioning part. Not that he is not in good shape, he is a great worker. But again, his biggest weakness last year was his strength, like a lot of young players. And he is a lot stronger now. But you miss that much time and that is going to be a factor.” \nClifford has spent the past month trying to stop the Hornets’ hemorrhaging, and Kaminsky’s offense has been just one of his attempted solutions. He wanted to get better defense out of his second unit, which led to the acquisition of Miles Plumlee in early February, but Plumlee has been out with a calf injury. Cody Zeller, too, has been dealing with a quad injury that has sapped the Hornets’ frontcourt depth. \nCharlotte has lost 10 out of its last 11 games, dropping to 24-32 with a six-game road trip ahead. With Thursday’s trade deadline approaching, there has been speculation that the Hornets could sell off pieces and aim to move up in this year’s lottery. Kaminsky has not been involved in any of those discussions. \nBut a source with knowledge of the team’s thinking insists that is not in the plan, and that the Hornets will forgo tanking in order to make a push for the playoffs. League sources said that Charlotte has been actively seeking help at backup point guard—especially a scorer off the bench—and have been one of several teams to inquire about Lakers guard Lou Williams. \nMORE: Kings failed with disastrous DeMarcus Cousins trade \nThe Hornets have had injuries, but still, they will need more depth if they’re going to rally for a playoff spot. “It’s been unfortunate,” Kaminsky said. “Missing Cody, missing Miles, having the trade happen. But I have been going out there and playing to the best of my abilities. Try to help our team as much as I can. I know we have to attack the second half of the season, the last quarter of the season and make a playoff push.” \nClifford knows Kaminsky will have to be a big part of that. The Hornets, remember, were so enamored by Kaminsky in the 2015 draft that they reportely passed on the chance to take a package of six draft choices from the Celtics in order to pick him. \n“He’s got a chance to be terrific,” Clifford said. “For a guy his size, he can pass, he knows how to play, and he is going to be a shotmaker. I feel no less a sense of excitement about him, but it is just part of growing and he has to work his way through it.” Watch This ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:32:11.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
