We need to do it soon... I would like to see a migration of people away from current technologies to lower emission technologies. We are providing incentives to do that now and we will be doing more in the months ahead.\"\nNew cars are better for the environment Credit: AFP F ormer transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin suggested last year that the Treasury should rethink schemes that encourage people to buy diesel cars or increase taxes in order to deal with the problem.\nSources said George Osborne, the former Chancellor, was opposed to a diesel scrappage scheme but that Philip Hammond is more open to the idea if it can be proven to work.\nThe Telegraph understands MPs on the transport committee have also been in discussion with the Department for Transport about the viability of such a scheme.\nOne MP said: \"The department is looking at this in a serious way but it simply won't go far enough to tackle the real problem of heavily polluting HGVs, farm vehicles and ships.\"\nLorries are also heavy polluters Credit: Getty B ut campaigners and the car industry support the idea, which mirrors a scheme developed by the French Government to remove old diesel vehicles from the roads because of the high levels of pollution they emit. \nHoward Cox, Founder of the FairFuelUK Campaign, said: \"The decision by Westminster Council to add 50% to the cost of parking diesel vehicles is just greedy unscrupulous money grabbing using dubious emissions evidence as the reason to fleece hard working motorists.\n“There must be incentives for hard pressed motorists of older diesels to want to change to EVs, hybrids or ultra-low emission vehicles, such as in the French approach. Punishing millions of diesel drivers for mistakes in past UK Government policy is neither fair nor honest. There will be a cost in any scrappage scheme, but in the long term the economy and the environment will be the winners.”\nA Treasury spokesman said: \"The Government continues to keep all taxes under review and any changes are announced at fiscal events.”\nChris Grayling Credit: PA W hile a Department for Transport spokesman said there are currently \"no plans\" to introduce a scrappage scheme.\nIt came as Mr Grayling also announced a consultation into Heathrow expansion and changes to the way air traffic control works in the UK.\nThe transport secretary promised new technology to cut jet noise from Heathrow take-off and landing sites and announced a “compensation fund\" for noise insulation and community projects in the wake of the decision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:12:41.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
