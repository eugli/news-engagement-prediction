They scheduled a maintenance inspection. \n\"I walked in the house and smelled chemicals straight away,\" the woman said. \n\"I got as far as the second bedroom and said to [my husband], 'I can't do this'. It was just heartbreaking, it was unbelievably heartbreaking.\" \n\"[My husband] continued through the house and found holes in the walls, in the doors - there was dog crap everywhere and there was so much rubbish in the front yard.\" Ad Feedback \nThe visit, combined with advice from a friend, prompted the couple to get the house tested for meth contamination, which they did through testing company Meth Solutions. \nThe results came back showing residual levels of the drug at 10.8 micrograms per square metre, at least five times more than the threshold recommended by the Ministry of Health. \nThe guidelines, released late last year stated post de-contaminatiion samples from a property where meth was used should not exceed 2 micrograms per square metre. \nHowever, for properties where meth had been manufactured, the recommended threshold dropped to 0.5 micrograms per square metre. \nThe couple had to pull the house from the market; and because the Marlborough District Council was notified, the fact the property was contaminated was also put on the LIM report. \n\"Even if we were to renovate it the value won't go up because it's on the LIM report, people will know it as a P house, and the stigma around that means they won't buy it,\" the man said. \n\"We won't be able to sell it for what we owe on it, so we've lost all the equity in the house and at this point of time we're facing bankruptcy,\" his wife added. \nThe council issued a repair order under the Health Act, which required the couple to remediate the property so individual samples taken from each room were under the 0.5 microgram limit. \nHowever, the man said it would cost them upwards of $3000 to have a more detailed, room-by-room test carried out, and tens of thousands dollars more replacing carpets, and doing other remedial work. \nThey would also have to pay for another inspection to check the work had been successful, money they did not have and which they were doubtful they could recover from the tenants or their insurance company. \nIf the repair notice was not complied with, the council could issue a closing order, which deemed the property uninhabitable. \nThe couple bought the house from the woman's parents when her father fell ill, and later died. \nShe grew up in the house, as did her children, and said their memories had been tainted by the experience. \n\"I just find myself constantly apologising to my dad for this mess, hoping he can hear me,\" she said. \n\"We can't sell it, not unless there's a millionaire out there that's willing to take it off our hands.\" \nMORE RIGHTS FOR LANDLORDS \nThe husband said their experience showed landlords needed more rights, both to be able to conduct meth contamination tests and to evict tenants. \nTenants could refuse the tests if they were not included in their tenancy agreements, he said. \nSummit Blenheim area manager property management Tyler Humby said the company included provisions for testing in all of its agreements with tenants. \nShe recommended people concerned about contamination take tests prior to a tenancy commencing, and if they had any suspicions during a tenure. \nThe husband also wanted more powers given to police to investigate on the basis of contamination reports. \n\"I think if the cops get tests like this they need to be able to act on them,\" he said. \n\"They need to be able to go through and search the house, and as a landlord you need to be able to get them out on the spot, preferably with police help.\" \nBlenheim community Constable Russ Smith said police welcomed information from the public, but said a test showing positive meth contamination was not enough to arrest someone. \n\"It could conceivably be a useful piece of information that would help police to make further enquiries, but on it's own it's not going to be sufficient for police to arrest someone,\" he said. \n\"If the owner or the landlord has the house tested subsequent to someone staying in it, the test may come back positive but that's not necessarily evidence that the person in the house was doing drugs.\" \nA Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment spokeswoman said for a tenant to be evicted for using meth, landlords had to file an application with the Tenancy Tribunal. \nThis should include a police report for supporting evidence, along with any contamination reports, she said. \nLandlords \"may be able to claim costs of remedial work to restore the property through the Tenancy Tribunal\" if the tenants were shown to be using meth, as it would be considered intentional damage. - The Marlborough Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:28:37.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
