The lawsuit was filed by the Bermuda Attorney General late Tuesday in federal court in Boston, and alleges that for nearly two decades, Lahey conspired with Dr. Ewart Brown , the former premier of Bermuda, to give Lahey preferential treatment when bidding on healthcare contracts issued by the Bermudian government. In exchange, Brown was allegedly given bribes disguised as consulting fees. Lahey Hospital and Medical Center Size: Between 251 and 400 beds Courtesy/Lahey Health The complaint also alleges that Lahey obtained privileged access to Bermudian patients that it could serve at facilities in Massachusetts and in Bermuda, and made millions of dollars reading and interpreting \"medically unnecessary\" MRI and CT scans performed at two private health clinics in Bermuda owned by Brown. “The enterprise was wildly successful and resulted in the enrichment of both Lahey and Brown at the expense of the Bermudian Government and people,” the suit states. A spokesman from Lahey Health said they hadn’t yet reviewed the lawsuit but the hospital was confident that the suit lacked merit. “We have a 25-year track record of providing the highest-quality care to our patients in Bermuda, and our business practices are beyond reproach,” said Christopher Murphy , a spokesman for the hospital. “In fact, Lahey Hospital & Medical Center provides high quality care to the people of Bermuda at a lower cost than other international health care providers on the island. We will review these allegations and vigorously defend ourselves through every step of the legal process. Despite this lawsuit, we remain committed to the people of Bermuda, as we believe our presence on the island has greatly benefitted our patients and their communities.” In addition to working in Bermuda for over two decades, Lahey has recently expanded its focus abroad. In September 2015, it created an Executive & International Health program to look at international partnerships more strategically. Lahey has additional relationships in Canada and Jordan. Lahey has joined a number of other health organizations to have partnerships abroad, sending doctors to health clinics overseas, helping create health systems, even receiving referrals to Massachusetts hospitals from overseas partners. Though international partnerships are common among Massachusetts medical institutions, the lawsuit alleged that Brown used his position within the Bermudian government to ensure Lahey was the overseas provider of choice for the island, and that Bermuda directed lucrative health care contracts with Lahey. The relationship allegedly began when Brown served as Bermuda’s Shadow Minister for Human Affairs in 1997 and continued even after he stepped down as Premier in 2010. The suit says Bermudians have been ranked the most scanned patients in the world, receiving twice as many as nations with comparable populations. The suit also points to Lahey’s revenue from the relationship. Between 2006 and 2016, Bermudian public healthcare insurers paid Lahey over $40 million for services Lahey provided in Massachusetts. Brown also paid Lahey “hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars in fees to interpret MRI and CT scans performed at his clinic,” the suit states. According to the lawsuit, Brown also had a consulting arrangement with Lahey, where in exchange for consulting fees, Brown and his clinics would promote health care opportunities in Bermuda and elsewhere in the West Indies. In 2001, those fees totaled at least $125,000, and grew over time, the suit says. In 2008, emails show Brown was paid $504,000 in consulting fees by Lahey, according to the lawsuit. Brown, who has a home in Martha’s Vineyard in addition to his Bermuda residence, is not named in the suit. He has vehemently refuted claims of bribery and objected to ongoing investigations into his activities, according to coverage in the Royal Gazette.
