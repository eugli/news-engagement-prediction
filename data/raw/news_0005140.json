Swati is the wife of former BJP leader Dayashankar Singh, who was removed from the post of state vice-president in July last year, and expelled for six years after he compared BSP chief Mayawati to a prostitute. \nA newcomer in politics, Swati appeared on the scene after BSP leaders raised “obscene slogans” about Dayashankar’s daughter, sister and herself during a protest in Lucknow. Swati later lodged a complaint at Hazratganj police station against Mayawati and other BSP leaders like Naseemuddin Siddiqui and Ram Achal Rajbhar, who were part of the protest. BJP appointed her as president of party’s Mahila Morcha in September last year. \nWatch what else is making news \nThe party’s media in-charge Harishchandra Srivastava confirmed Swati Singh’s candidature. Dayashankar, who was arrested in connection with an FIR lodged against him by a BSP leader for his remarks, was released on the bail by a local court in Mau in August. The couple then held several meetings across the state against the BSP, saying that the “obscene” slogans raised by BSP leaders against his women relatives was “a disrespect” to Kshatriyas. \nMeanwhile, Sharda Pratap Shukla, sitting SP MLA from Sarojini Nagar and minister in the Akhilesh government, said on Monday he has filed his nomination papers as an independent candidate as well as nominee of the Rashtriya Lok Dal . “I have been assured of symbol by RLD, but I have not yet left the SP. If Akhileshji wants, I would leave it. I will decide tomorrow about whether to contest as an Independent or as RLD candidate,” he said. Tuesday is the last day for filing nominations for 69 seats, including Sarojini Nagar.
