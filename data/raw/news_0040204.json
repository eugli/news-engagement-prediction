Michael Pascoe comments. \nIn the presumed security of razor gang deliberations, it seems, Malcolm Turnbull and his team went tantalisingly close to alchemising two metals rarely seen in Canberra these days: political courage, and policy heft. \nThe result would have brought the short term discomfort of a significant backdown through cutting the 50 per cent capital gains tax concession, but also perhaps, kudos for arriving at a sensible policy change.

Not only the embarrassment of a backdown, but the loss of market differentiation or a a clear line of fire at the opposition. \nLabor of course, favours curbs to negative gearing too - something Treasurer Scott Morrison once supported, acknowledging there are \"excesses\". \nBut these issue are now so mired in politics such that even touching the CGT concession remains a no-fly-zone for the Coalition. \nTurnbull's awkwardness on Thursday was palpable. As Labor sought to skewer him on a looming policy backflip in the May budget, Turnbull writhed and wriggled, using words which suggested the government had no \"plans\" and no \"intentions\" to alter the concession. \nPolitical watchers had already noticed Morrison's quietness - a weekly Sydney radio spot on Thursday had come and gone with no attempt to shut down the AFR 's report. \nStarkly absent from Turnbull's answers was the definitive statement ruling any change out completely. But then several questions in, it finally came. \nThat was a relief for Finance Minister Mathias Cormann - who'd ruled out any CGT change in the morning. It was also another win for politics over policy. Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T09:29:55.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
