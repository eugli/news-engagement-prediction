When you aren’t around your kitty, do you get so down that you spend even more hours watching YouTube cat videos? In some cases, the connection between cat lovers and mental health may be more than just a stereotype, new research shows. Here’s why: Some cats carry a parasite called toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), which can be passed on to humans. And that parasite can transmit a disease called toxoplasmosis, which has infected more than 60 million people in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates. Toxoplasmosis can cause flu-like symptoms (achy muscles and bones) that last for a month or more, blindness and miscarriages. A dangerous case can occur from a severe infection, or one that occurred earlier in life and is now reactivated, the CDC says. Those cases are most likely in people with weak immune systems. Infected cats may have symptoms of mild diarrhea and loss of appetite, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Your veterinarian can test your pet for the disease. Parasite also causes mental disorders Now, researchers have learned that the parasite may also increase the risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in people, according to a 2015 study published in the journal Schizophrenia Research . Owning a cat in childhood is much more common in families in which children are later diagnosed with schizophrenia or another serious mental illness, the study authors said in a statement. “These findings may give further clues about how T. gondii infection can possibly [alter] the risk of specific psychiatric disorders,” the authors note. What’s the connection? Researchers aren’t sure yet. So far, they’ve established only a connection between toxoplasmosis and mental disorders, but not a cause and effect. One theory is that the infection can “rewire” the brain, causing schizophrenic behavior. Genes also may play a role – meaning a person who was already predisposed to get schizophrenia may be more likely to if they have the infection. Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, disabling brain disorder that interferes with the way a person interprets reality. People with schizophrenia may hear voices or see things that others don’t, become paranoid that people are plotting against them and withdraw socially. Bipolar disorder causes extreme mood swings, from emotional highs (mania) to extreme lows (depression). The mood shifts may occur only a few times a year or several times a week. They can hurt relationships and affect your ability to function. Additional studies back research results A review by Dutch researchers – who analyzed the findings of 50 published studies – confirmed that if you’re infected with T. gondii, you’re almost twice as likely to develop schizophrenia. Their results were recently published in the journal Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica . “In schizophrenia, the evidence of an association with T. gondii is overwhelming,” the authors say in a press release. Diagnosing and treating toxoplasmosis If you suspect you may have toxoplasmosis, you can have a blood test to find out. If you test positive for it, your doctor will help determine if you need treatment. Those who aren’t pregnant and are otherwise healthy probably won’t need it, according to the CDC. Symptoms will disappear within several weeks to months. Antibiotics may be recommended for pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system. As for cats: Infection can be determined by testing their feces, although a positive result doesn’t always mean the cat currently has toxoplasmosis, according to the Companion Animal Parasite Council, which creates guidelines for parasite control. There’s no approved treatment for the disease in cats, but some medications work, including antibiotics. How to prevent exposure to T. gondii Fortunately, you can reduce your risk of toxoplasmosis. The CDC offers these tips: If you have a cat, change the litter box daily. The toxoplasmosis parasite becomes infectious 1 to 5 days after it’s shed in a cat’s feces. Feed cats only canned or dried commercial food or well-cooked table food. Avoid raw or undercooked meats. Cats can become toxoplasmosis carriers by eating wild animals that have been infected with the parasite. Keep outdoor sandboxes covered so cats can’t go in them. Wear gloves when gardening and during contact with soil or sand. Wash your hands with soap and warm water after gardening or contact with soil or sand. If you’re pregnant: Toxoplasmosis is especially dangerous to fetuses, so you should avoid cleaning litter boxes. If you do clean up after your cat, wear disposable gloves and wash your hands thoroughly afterward. Keep your cat indoors. Don’t adopt or handle stray cats, especially kittens.
