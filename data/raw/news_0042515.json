It is one of the biggest finds in decades here,\" she said. \n\"It may help fill a gap in time that we haven't got from any other fossil deposit.\" \nThe dig and the world heritage listed Naracoorte Caves will feature in the 6-part documentary , which delves into how the unique landscapes of Australia and New Zealand helped modern day flora and fauna evolve from their predecessors. \nThousands of fossil specimens from over 100 different animal species have been found at the Naracoorte Caves , including extinct Megafauna such as the giant short-faced kangaroo — Procoptodon goliah — and the marsupial lion — Thylacoleo carnifex.

(ABC South East: Kate Hill) \nDr Reed said the newly-discovered cave, which was stumbled upon 10 years ago by a local landholder, was a perfect example of how the everyday citizen could play an important scientific role. \nAfter discovering a small opening in the ground, the resident had promptly reported the find and had protected the site until scientists could conduct further investigations. \n\"When we went down there it was just a little tiny hole on the surface, then it dropped down about 5 or 6 metres,\" Dr Reed said. \n\"We went in there and couldn't believe our eyes. It's an important megafauna fossil site.\" \n\"This is a great story of citizen science and how the community is helping us to preserve and research this wonderful fossil heritage.\" \nDr Reed said the challenge for scientists was to protect and preserve such sites before they came to the attention of unscrupulous dealers, who could sell fossils into private collections and into the black market. \n\"We can share our science. These fossils belong in a museum where everyone can enjoy them.\" Photo: The large claw of the 'executioner' lion, fossils unearthed at Naracoorte a decade ago. (ABC South East SA: Kate Hill) Skull of extinct kangaroo unearthed \nThe preserved underground world of the cave could potentially unlock many secrets and help scientists reconstruct past climates and environments. \n\"We will be able to understand how animals responded to climate change in the past, and that will give us information to how we might be able to predict responses in the future,\" she said. \n\"On the very first day of digging, we found a skull of an extinct kangaroo, just a baby.\" \nDr Reed said the film crew keenly recorded every moment of the dig. \n\"It was literally the first day we picked up tools. They were really keen to see how we go about approaching a site for the first time.\" \nThe material the scientists uncover will be documented, studied and will end up at the South Australian Museum, where the 'Megafauna Gallery' is a popular exhibit. \nCrews also filmed at the University of Adelaide where scientists are working on paleo-botany items, which Dr Reed dubbed 'old plants'. \nThe documentary is set to broadcast on the Discovery Channel in 2018 and will give viewers a look at just how significant the Naracoorte Caves and south-east region is to paleontology history. \nDr Reed was confident there were plenty more ancient treasures to be unearthed in the Naracoorte and wider south-east region in future years. \n\"I honestly think at times we have just scratched the surface, pardon the pun,\" she said. \n\"The old saying' the past is the key to the present' really hits home at Naracoorte,\" Dr Reed said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T13:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:56:56.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
