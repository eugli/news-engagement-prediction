As the situation slipped out of control, Meghwal's supporters retaliated by throwing stones at the policemen. \nThe cops, in questioned, complained that that they were manhandled and thrashed by BJP MLA's husband and his supporters. \nA case has been registered against Meghwal and over half a dozen BJP workers. \nDefending her husband, the BJP MLA said Naresh and his supporters were attacked and detained by the police. She even alleged that in the fight, her sari was torn and her bangles broken. \nCommenting on the incident, Kota Superintendent of Police Sawai Singh Godara said a high-level probe has been ordered and action will be taken. \nRajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has also been informed about the incident. \nWatch the incident here.   14:32 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:08:59.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
