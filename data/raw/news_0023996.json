The club’s net debt is up 27.1 per cent in quarterly figures published on Thursday afternoon. Both broadcasting and matchday revenues both soared in the quarter to £52.5m and £38.6m respectively. Manchester United vice-chairman Ed Woodward said the club are 'on track to record revenues' But fans will remain concerned at the level of debt United are operating with, although their report attempted to stem any worries. ‘The increase in net debt is due to the strengthening US dollar,’ it stated. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward said: ‘We are pleased to be competing for the first available trophy of the season when we travel to Wembley to face Southampton in the EFL Cup final this month. ‘The robustness of our business model continues to be reflected in our strong quarterly financial results and we remain on track to deliver record revenues for the year. ‘Finally, I’d like to congratulate Wayne Rooney on becoming Manchester United’s all-time record goal scorer – achieving the remarkable feat of scoring 250 goals over the last 13 seasons, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton’s record which has stood for 44 years.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched Sport videos ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:45:37.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
