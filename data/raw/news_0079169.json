Leicester vs Liverpool \nThat decision has split opinion within football, drawing stinging criticism from some Sky Sports experts while others say a change of boss was necessary . \nLeicester head into the Liverpool game in the relegation places and the club's former centre-half Sinclair believes caretaker boss Shakespeare represents their best chance of beating the drop. Shakespeare says he feels very sad that Ranieri was sacked but admits results have not been good enough \nHe said: \"I think Craig Shakespeare, with him knowing the players and the relationship you have as a coach with your players, I think he would be the one that you'd look at to steer them through at least until the end of the season. \n\"See if they can get out of the situation they're in, and then maybe in the summer you look again if he hasn't done the job.\" \nShakespeare made it clear last week he is \"not fazed\" by the prospect of taking on the role permanently, and Sinclair said: \"It seems that he does fancy the job and is confident within himself. I'd stick with Craig Shakespeare until the end of the season.\" New customers: Grab a Sky Sports Month Pass for Â£20pm for the first 2 months. No contract. \nNigel Pearson, who lost his job after keeping Leicester up in 2015, is the bookies' favourite to replace Ranieri. \n\"The Nigel Pearson one - the way he exited the club I'm not sure the owners would be looking to bring him back,\" Sinclair said.
