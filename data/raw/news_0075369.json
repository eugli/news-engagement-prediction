In spite of this over the past six years Wrap said there has been a sharp rise in use by dates being used on yoghurts, with 91pc having adopted them in 2015, up by 34pc from 2011 when 57pc had a use by date. \nCheese also saw an increase over the period with 65pc carrying a use by date, up by 19pc from 44pc in 2011. And use by dates are now present on 75pc of Naan bread, up by 39pc since 2011, when they were found on 36pc of packs. \nWrap will now conduct a formal review of products which may be needlessly carrying a use by date and will ask manufacturers to change date marks which are found to be inappropriate.\nMulti-packs of yoghurt are the worst offenders for misleading use by dates, Wrap said Credit: George Doyle A round 350,000 tonnes of avoidable food waste a year, which comes at a £1 billion to consumers, could be prevented through \"technical\" changes such as changing labels, the report said. \nDr Andrew Parry, Special Adviser at Wrap, said it was not clear why some manufacturers were moving to use by dates despite guidance telling them not to.\nHe said: \"Getting this right could save consumers a lot of money which is why we are telling the industry that if there isn't a food safety risk they should not print use by dates on packs. We have already been talking to the UK dairy industry and the juice industry, and good progress has already been made.\"\nWrap said it was also concerned to find a reduction in blue snowflake logos which remind customers that food is suitable for freezing. These were present on 15pc of applicable products, down from 21pc in 2011 with particular reductions in bread, chicken, juice and cooking sauce. \nBread is among the most wasted foods in the UK as it tends to go stale or mouldy before people can eat it Credit: incamerastock / Alamy Stock Photo A nd while there are now more small-sized packs of some foods, including salad, which appeal to those who live alone or in a couple, small packs of sliced bread are disappearing. Standard 800g loaves made up 75pc of the total products in 2015, up by 11pc from 66pc in 2011. Smaller 400g loaves made up 18pc of sales in 2015, down by 9pc from 27pc in 2011.\nWrap also noted that smaller loaves had become more expensive over the period and are now \"significantly\" more expensive than larger ones.\nIt said bread was a particularly important area as it is one of the most wasted products from UK homes with 460,000 tonnes thrown away per year. Most of this is due to packs being opened but not finished in time before going stale or go mouldy. \nOverall Wrap said around 150,000 tonnes of household food waste was avoided in 2015 compared to 2007 as a result of technical changes to products, saving families around £400 million a year.\nHeather Hancock, chairman of the Food Standards Agency said: \"The FSA is working closely with Wrap on updating the guidance on the application of on pack dates and related storage advice. I believe it is important that information available on pack not only helps to ensure people have safe food, but that it makes it as easy as possible for them to manage and store their food to ensure less is wasted.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:15:52.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
