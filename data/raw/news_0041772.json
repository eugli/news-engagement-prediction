The research, conducted by students Will Casto and Danielle Gibsonon with a biology professor, focuses on what effect microgravity will have on the smooth muscle cells in rat hearts. Microgravity has been a part of space research since the first International Space Station expeditions.\nSpaceX Returns to Flight With Successful Falcon 9 Launch\nSpaceX Successfully Launches 10 Satellites Into Space\nTheir community in the Appalachian Kentucky has a high rate of hypertension, or high blood pressure , which can be associated with heart problems. They hope this research will provide some new insights into what affects the conditions.\n\"If we get a set of raw data, the end goal is to see what changes and what happens,\" Gibson said.\n\"When they first approached me, I was hesitant\" said Dr. Michael Fultz, their research mentor and a biology professor at Morehead State University. \"But, Will and Danielle hit it off right away. They are go-getters and they are a pleasure to work with.\"\nDr. Carol Christian, Director of The Craft Academy for Excellence in Science and Mathematics, a high school on the Morehead campus where the two study, stressed how proud they are of their students and that the research has \"exceeded expectations.\"\nThe two intrepid teenagers hope to see their research through until the summer -- that is, if the experiment on board the rocket survives through launch.\nBut, their ambitions stretch much further into the future.\n\"The end goal would be to end up in medical school studying oncology ,\" Casto said, \"because cancer rates are very high in the community where I am from.\"\nGibson hopes to pursue a career in biomedicine.\n\"This gives me a lot of hope,\" she said. \"If I can do this at seventeen what else can I do?\"\n0 Shares Email Star Comments \"\nHigh school students to launch biology research into space \"\nTrump leaps back into campaign mode, raps media anew \"\nSenate confirms EPA nominee Scott Pruitt despite a renewed court battle \"\nDakota Access Pipeline protesters meet with authorities over emergency evacuation order \"\nHundreds of DC Zika virus tests to be re-examined after 'technical issues' \"\nPope: Migration isn't a danger, it's a challenge for growth \"\nRussell Simmons, rabbi, imam holding 'I Am A Muslim' rally \"\nN.
