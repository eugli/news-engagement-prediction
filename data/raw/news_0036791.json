Photo: Jessica Hromas \n\"We acknowledge that there will be a period of disruption during the later stages of this project, but we have an expectation by working with industry that we can minimise that,\" he said, \n\"We are obviously aiming for three months or better, depending on how the building of the metro system can take place.\" Advertisement \nSignificant preliminary work will also be undertaken during quieter times of the year such as weekends and school holidays. \nBuses were the most likely alternative transport for commuters during the closure. \nMr Constance said about 30 per cent of people who travelled on the Bankstown line did not travel outside the rail corridor, which meant data from the Opal ticketing system could be used to decide on the best alternative transport. \nAll 11 stations between Sydenham and Bankstown will be renovated to include lifts, level platforms and screen safety doors. \nSydney Metro project director Rodd Staples said every station on the Bankstown Line would remain at its existing location but some platforms and entrances would be shifted. \nAbout five residential properties at Sydenham would need to be acquired for the conversion of the line, as well as a small number of commercial leases. \n\"We are in the process of engaging with all of those property owners at the moment,\" he said. \nThe first single-deck trains are due to begin running on the converted Bankstown line in 2024, which will form part of stage two of the metro railway that continues on from Sydenham to the central business district and Chatswood. \nConstruction is starting this year on the Chatswood-to-Sydenham component of the line, and will require the demolition of 19 towers – some of which are as high as 22 storeys high – in Sydney's CBD. \nAn existing line between Epping and Chatswood in Sydney's north will also be closed for seven months from late next year to allow for the completion of the first stage of the $20 billion project. \nThe first section of the new line from Rouse Hill in the northwest to Chatswood is scheduled to be opened in 2019, the same year as the next state election.
