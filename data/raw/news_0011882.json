UK police and other emergency services are already using data to predict areas of greatest risk from burglary and fire.” \nSuch “contingent labour” platforms, it says, could suit hospitals and schools as an alternative to traditional agency models, as well as organisations which experience seasonal peaks in demand such as HMRC at the end of the tax year. \nReform also calls for a shift towards a more private sector-style organisational culture, suggesting that “shared kitchens and feedback boards [will] enable the spontaneous interactions that will support a new culture of public service innovation”. \nThe new approach to recruitment would bring the profile of public sector workers closer to that of the private sector, which has three times as many under-24s in its workforce. \nThe report also highlights the scope for increased automation in policing through crowd-monitoring drones and facial recognition technology, although it acknowledges the concerns involved in holding people’s images. \nAlexander Hitchcock, the report’s co-author, said: “Such a rapid advance in the use of technology may seem controversial, and any job losses must be handled sensitively. But the result would be public services that are better, safer, smarter and more affordable.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T16:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:18:28.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
