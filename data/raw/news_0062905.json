He returned to the studio still recovering, suffering from short-term memory loss. He had difficulty reading; language was challenging. As a way to organize his thinking, he kept a visual diary.\nWhat started as a coping mechanism developed into art. Pitt’s unconventional small sculptures, developed from his drawings, are up now at Steven Zevitas Gallery.\nAdvertisement\nIn his last show at Zevitas, in 2013, the works hung on the wall and many had a rectangular border; they contended with the idea of painting. These new pieces are more sculptural, constructed from wood and coated with acrylic paint, assembled buffet style on a counter-high table.\nYet you can see their origins in drawing; they are flat forms fleshed out in layers. Demure and guarded, they still hum with peculiar energy, like the guy who entertains himself at a party, heedless of the other guests. They hover in the realm of symbols — pictographs, hieroglyphs, letters — yet they communicate something less concrete, something sensed but inarticulate — urges, feelings, confusions.\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. Occasionally, sculptures edge toward the recognizable. “P51” resembles McDonald’s golden arches, but in plush teal green brilliantly underscored in lime. And symmetry is gone: The form slouches to one side, and one leg reaches tentatively out, like that of a daddy longlegs finding its way.\nPitt’s plywood layers don’t align smoothly; the awkwardness is intentional and endearing. But he knows how to make things fit, using joinery here and there. If it had a face, “P48” would be a pimply, square-headed fellow in profile, wearing a tortuous black night brace that fits snugly into notches at the back of an open mouth.\nThe physical accessibility and humble forms of these sculptures suggest familiarity, but don’t be fooled. Pitt’s works are signal lights from somewhere deep and barely explored, sending messages in a code we can only begin to discern.\nJAMES STERLING PITT: POINTS EAST\nAdvertisement\nAt Steven Zevitas Gallery, 450 Harrison Ave., through\nMarch 25. 617-778-5265, www.stevenzevitasgallery.com\nCate McQuaid can be reached at catemcquaid@gmail.com.
