The memo revealed her sophomore full-length's release date — or the release date for a new single, perhaps — to be March 7. \nWith SNL 's March 11 broadcast in mind, this syncs up perfectly with Republic's supposed timeframe, so fingers crossed we'll have the next \"Royals\" soon enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:53:55.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
