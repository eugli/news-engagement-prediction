(Jeff Krage / Pioneer Press) Todd Shields School District 220, has led to many unintended lessons, primarily one on how much food goes uneaten in a week, said Sunny Hill fourth-grader Liz Tinajero.\n\"This is a good deed because we're saving food, instead of throwing it away,\" she said. \nTinajero and other Sunny Hill student council members collect unused food each week and help transport the items to area food pantries that serve low-income families. \nAs part of an expanded program this year, the nonprofit Mindful Waste introduced the food recycling program at Countryside, Hough, Lines, North Barrington, Barrington Middle School — Prairie Campus and Sunny Hill schools in District 220. \nThe goal behind the program is to prevent food waste that would otherwise end up in landfills, according to Jennifer Kainz and Renee Blue. \nBoth founded Mindful Waste in 2015 and began a pilot program of their recycling idea a year later at Countryside Elementary in District 220, they said. \nLast spring, the school collected 750 pounds of unopened and unwanted food for local pantries.

(Jeff Krage / Pioneer Press) \n\"Based on waste audits we have conducted throughout District 220 schools, there is over 200 pounds of perfectly good food thrown away each day,\" Kainz said. \nDistrict 220 officials have said the new program teaches young students the value of saving food to help others in need while they also work to help stock the shelves at area pantries. \nFood pantries that work with District 220 on the program include Cuba Township near Barrington, Barrington Township, FISH Food Pantry in Carpentersville, Carpentersville Middle School in Algonquin-based Community Unit District 300 and Mount St. Joseph Intermediate Care Facility in Lake Zurich. \n\"This is great for the kids because it's a service learning project and they can do it independently without much help,\" said Amanda Domeracki, a fourth-grade teacher at Sunny Hill. \"They take ownership.\" \nThe new program also shows kids different ways to give back to the community, said Elizabeth Jimenez-Bure, a Sunny Hill art teacher. \n\"We're showing our kids you don't have to have money to help people,\" she said. \"Our students are just using their two hands.\" \nTeresa DeCicco, manager of Barrington Township Food Pantry, said the program delivers fresh food items for patrons on a regular basis. The fact that the project has involved so many District 220 students and cafeterias also is unusual to see, she said. \n\"Someone is being proactive about food waste happening in school cafeterias,\" DeCicco said. \"It's nice to get fresh food items delivered to the pantry — apples, oranges, milk, cheese sticks.\" \nTwitter @tshields19", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:46:34.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
