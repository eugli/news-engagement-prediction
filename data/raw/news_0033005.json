The Governor will take decision based on situation. The BJP has no interest to interfere.’(PTI) \nUnion Information and Broadcasting Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has no interest to interfere in the ongoing political tussle in Tamil Nadu, adding that Governor Ch. Vidyasagar Rao will act on his discretion. \n“The Centre has no role to play. The Governor will take decision based on situation. The BJP has no interest to interfere,” Naidu told the media. \nRead: BJP cheers Sasikala’s conviction in corruption case, pins hope on Panneerselvam \nEarlier in the day, AIADMK general secretary V.K. Sasikala Natarajan suffered a major jolt after the Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s judgment convicting her in the 19-year-old disproportionate assets case against her. \nFormer Tamil Nadu chief minister late J. Jayalalithaa, along with Sasikala and two others were involved in the case. \nThe Bengaluru trial court had convicted Jayalalithaa on September 27, 2014 and ordered her four years of imprisonment along with Rs. 100 crore fines, with Rs. 10 crore fine on the other three. \nThe conviction disqualified her as an MLA requiring her to step down as the chief minister. \nShe, however, returned as the chief minister after Karnataka High Court on May 11, 2015 acquitted her and the others in the case.
