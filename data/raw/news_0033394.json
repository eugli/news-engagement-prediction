The United States “reaffirmed its iron-clad security commitments” to South Korea and Japan, the Pentagon said. \nHan said the divided Korean peninsula “remains the world’s biggest hotspot with a constant danger of war”. \nHe condemned joint military exercises carried out annually by South Korea and the United States, as well as what he called “nuclear threats” and blackmail towards his country. \n“It is the legitimate self-defence right of the sovereign state to possess strong deterrence to cope with such threat by hostile forces aimed at overthrowing the state and the socialist system,” he said. \nRead: North Korea fires ballistic missile, apparently challenging Donald Trump \nNorth Korea shared mankind’s common goal of global denuclearisation, Han said. \n“The DPRK supports global efforts toward nuclear disarmament and complete obliteration of nuclear weapons and we play a responsible role to contribute to achieving global denuclearisation,” he said. \nJapan’s disarmament ambassador Nobushige Takamizawa in Geneva condemned North Korea’s latest missile launch and urged Pyongyang to comply with security council resolutions and not take further “provocative actions” that undermine peace and security in the region. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:33:30.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
