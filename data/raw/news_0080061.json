Priyanka took to Twitter to share a video, in which she, along with Teigen and ‚ÄúLive With Kelly‚Äù host Kelly Ripa, is seen having a funny conversation backstage of the event on February 26 night. They talk about hall pass, something of a tradition in the US where a husband or a wife allows the partner to go bachelor/spinster for a few days. As they are seen having a conversation, they bring in Aniston and ask her about her hall pass. Priyanka interviews Jennifer Aniston at Oscars 2017 backstage Priyanka captioned the video: ‚ÄúThis was too much fun. Chrissy Teigen, Kelly Ripa, Jennifer Aniston. Backstage shenanigans.‚Äù In the video, Priyanka is seen sporting the body-hugging gown by designer label ‚ÄúRalph & Russo‚Äù. The gown was done with geometric details with a structured bodice. She paired her gown with towering ivory heels, and accessorised the look with the bare minimum, drawing complete focus to the dress. Aniston too looked ravishing in a black sequined gown with a thigh-high slit and a plunging neck line.
