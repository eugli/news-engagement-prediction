In this report, we explore the mood and outlook of Indian startups given the recent budget, cautious investor climate and an uncertain global economy...” Ajay Hattangdi, Group COO and CEO India, said. \nNinety four per cent startups are looking to raise funding in 2017, with VC-backed companies aiming to raise a median of $2.5 million, the report pointed out. The average expectation on how long it could take to close the round is 4-5 months. \nDifficulty in raising equity funding was voted as the top business challenge, followed by difficulty in managing talent and market creation. However, the respondents were uncertain whether fund-raising will be more challenging in 2017 or less. \nOverall, almost 75 per cent of the set supposed that the startup ecosystem in 2017 will be driven by entrepreneurs, whilst 26 per cent voted that investors will play the pivotal role. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:32:58.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
