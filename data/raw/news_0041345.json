MYTCHALL BRANSGROVE/FAIRFAX NZ \nHeartland Potato Chips general manager Charlotte Bowan, and Heartland owner Raymond Bowan watch the cooked chips as they head along the production line. \nThis adds to the firm's six-flavour wave cut range, produced since the factory started in 2010, and its flat cut category introduced in 2015. \nFROM THE ARCHIVE: * Chipping in with a local product \nThe management team would not be drawn on how much they have invested in the new product line, citing commercial sensitivity. \nHowever, the couple's daughter and general manager, Charlotte Bowan, said kettle chips were popular and something they had been thinking about making for a while. \nThe two lines of products can not work in tandem without investment in further equipment. \n\"It is either one line or the other,\" she said. \n\"We can't work the two lines together yet.\" Ad Feedback \nHeartland Potato Chips, which employs 16 people, may need eight more workers. A double shift would increase output from 1500 cartons to 3000 cartons, containing 12 packets of 150gm each. \nThe company supplies Progressive Enterprises and Foodstuffs supermarkets throughout New Zealand, and exports to Singapore and Brisbane in Australia. \n\"We hope to export the kettle [chips] as well,\" she said. \nThe new equipment was tested at the start of February, and the first new chips were packaged last Tuesday but have only been distributed to Timaru supermarkets so far. \nBefore they trialled the new line, the firm worked with a flavour house to perfect the kettle chips. \n\"We were impressed with it coming off the line. We wanted to make sure it was right,\" Raymond Bowan said. \nThe difference between the usual wave cut chip and the kettle style was in the way they were cooked and travelled through the labyrinth of chutes and conveyors. \n\"Wave cut [chips] are in a continual line through the fryer for 3.5 minutes. Kettle chips are totally separate and about 80 kilograms to 120kg of potatoes are cooked at once.\" \nBecause the kettles entered and were removed from the fryer at the same time, there was 5 per cent less oil in the chip and they were crisper and crunchier, Charlotte Bowan said. \nThe factory had been busy stockpiling the wave cuts and flat cuts so it could concentrate on the new product. \nRaymond and Adrienne Bowan grow the potatoes at Orari on a 250-hectare plot. They also supply other local companies for french fries. The potatoes are fresh from January to the end of May and then stored for use over winter. \nThe biggest challenge of the business had actually been deciding to start it, while the highlight was seeing Heartland chips on the supermarket shelves, Raymond Bowan said. \nThe official launching of the new line will be held next Thursday for invited guests and then distributed nationally. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:00:44.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
