Mrs Cabales said: 'Touching his skin was like swiping an iPhone. The lightest touch would see layers of it come off in your hand. 'He was blistering, peeling, burning from the inside out. It was devastating.' Now he has to wear sunglasses when outside or under bright lights or he risks losing the rest of his minimal vision (pictured after he was given the medication) Mrs Cabales and her husband, military worker, Ronnie, 42, gave Xander Motrin to soothe him after he complained he was unwell. The fever vanished, but a few hours later it returned, worse than before. Touching his skin was like swiping an iPhone. The lightest touch would see layers of it come off in your hand Laura Cabales, 42 His temperature soared to 40.5 C and he was lethargic, with discharge streaming from his eyes. Concerned, his parents rushed him to Tripler Medical Center Hospital in Honolulu, near their home. As his condition worsened, Xander's behaviour became aggressive and he was admitted to casualty. Diagnosed with a series of medical complaints, including a collapsed lung, acute respiratory distress syndrome and bacterial pneumonia, his time was running out. Mrs Cabales said: 'Doctors said he was the sickest patient they had. He was dying. His skin blistered and burnt and he developed lesions on his body.' They were told he had Stevens-Johnson syndrome - a rare illness, where a person suffers an extreme and unpredictable adverse reaction to medication. Over a period of just five days, his condition deteriorated rapidly after reacting to the drug and he was left seriously ill (pictured in hospital) Classed as a medical emergency, according to the NHS, it causes a sufferer's skin and mucus membrane to peel off. He was taken to Kapiolani Hospital, also in Honolulu, where doctors placed him in an induced coma so he could recover. WHAT IS STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME? Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a rare disorder that begins with flu-like symptoms. These are followed by a painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters. Then the top layer of the affected skin dies and sheds. The illness, which is a form of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, is typically a reaction to a drug or an infection, and can prove fatal. Treatment focuses on eliminating the underlying cause, controlling symptoms and minimizing complications. Patient recovery can take weeks to months, depending on the severity of the syndrome. On life support, Xander spent the next three weeks unconscious. Finally, after being pumped full of antibiotics, he started to respond to treatment and come round. He eventually woke up more than a month after developing the fever. Now, nearly three years after his ordeal started, Xander is much better. But the long-term impact of his illness has been significant. He doesn't produce saliva anymore and the tiny hairs on the inside of his lungs have gone, meaning he can't cough or clear any mucus. And he has also suffered long-lasting damage to his lungs and is forced to rely on a nebuliser three times a day to aid his breathing. And since returning to school after recovering, he has been bullied for his condition. A spokesman from Johnson and Johnson, who make Motrin, said: 'As the makers of MOTRIN® (ibuprofen) products, we are committed to providing consumers with safe and effective over-the-counter medicines. 'Over decades and millions of uses, ibuprofen has proven safe and effective when used as directed. We are sympathetic to the pain and hardships suffered by anyone affected by Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.' The family were supported by charities the Kapiolani Health Foundation and the Stevens Johnson Syndrome Foundation.
