First, she was blocked from entering a Washington D.C. public school, and last week, the Education Department’s Twitter account misspelled the name of W.E.B. Du Bois. \nNow, she’s getting thrashed by that same D.C. middle school from which she was originally blocked after DeVos criticized the teachers employed there. To say whomever is running the Jefferson Academy Twitter account is pissed is an understatement. \nAfter all, look at this rant after DeVos was quoted as saying, via Townhall , “[The teachers are] waiting to be told what they have to do, and that’s not going to bring success to an individual child. You have to have teachers who are empowered to facilitate great teaching.” \nDeVos, it should be noted, has never been a teacher nor she does she have any experience with public schools. The school was not so eager to hear her criticisms. This is what Sec. DeVos said about our teachers after her visit. Needless to say, we're about to take her to school... @dcpublicschools pic.twitter.com/Wcx1YyqDHL — Jefferson Academy (@JATrojans) February 18, 2017 First, the secretary visited the classroom of Ashley Shepherd and Britany Locher, a dynamic co-teaching team that differentiates for the... — Jefferson Academy (@JATrojans) February 18, 2017 needs of students ranging from a first grade level to an eighth grade level in reading.

Whenever I need to see a committed staff and great instruction and see true transformation, I visit @JATrojans . You should too. — Jacqueline Greer (@JacquelineinEd) February 18, 2017 All of it led to DeVos softening her stance on Twitter on Saturday morning. . @JATrojans Your teachers are awesome! They deserve MORE freedom to innovate and help students. — Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVosED) February 18, 2017 . @JATrojans Great teachers deserve freedom and flexibility, not to constantly be on the receiving end of government dictates. — Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVosED) February 18, 2017 But if there’s a lesson here, it’s this. DeVos—who was onl y barely confirmed by the Senate —doesn’t seem to have much credibility with many of those involved with public schools. It also seems she has plenty of homework to do in order to actually build it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:08:10.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
