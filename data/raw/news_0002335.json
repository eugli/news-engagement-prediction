The This Is 40 star opened up to ET’s David Batista about the best words of wisdom she’s given to her gorgeous girl, who has appeared in Knocked Up, Pitch Perfect 2 and Girls. WATCH: Iris Apatow Is All Grown Up and Looks Just Like Mom Leslie Mann “[I told her] to learn to write and write her own stuff, so she doesn't have to rely on everyone else to give her jobs,” Mann shared, while promoting her new film, T he Comedian , in New York City on Tuesday. “That's good advice. That's pretty good advice, right?” The actress has two daughters with her husband, director Judd Apatow . While chatting about how the girls show her “cat videos that have gone viral,” the 44-year-old actress noted that she doesn’t necessarily want her younger daughter, Iris, to get into the family business just yet. “She just turned 14, so she's in school,” Mann said. “She's in eighth grade. I just want her to go to school and be a kid! For now.” The Comedian opens on Feb. 3 and follows an ageing comic (Robert De Niro), who gets sentenced to community service after getting into a fight with an audience member. While doing his service, he meets a younger woman, Harmony Schiltz, played by Mann. WATCH: Leslie Mann Gives the Most Honest and Hilarious Advice to Daughter Maude Apatow The How to Be Single star revealed that she was stumped about how to address De Niro, 73, when the pair first started working together. “I didn't feel comfortable calling him Bob,” she laughed. “He doesn't really seem like a 'Bob,' but he is Bob... but Robert doesn't sound right.” See what other advice Mann gave her daughter in the video below.
