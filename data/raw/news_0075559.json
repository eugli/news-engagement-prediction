Now 'This happened in my city. I am responsible': San Jose mayor vows to fix alert issues in flooding Veronica Rocha issued two flood warnings, the first Monday before 4 a.m., the second about 17 hours later, before water started pouring into San Jose homes Tuesday. \nBut some residents in the William Street area, one of the worst-hit neighborhoods, said they received no warning from the city via cellphone alerts and no local authorities came knocking before floodwaters started rising. \nOn Friday, Liccardo vowed to fix “whatever problems caused the lack of advance notice” to residents. \nHe said he would schedule public hearings to talk about the flooding and evacuations. \n“The public deserves to get all the information, not just some of it,” Liccardo said.
