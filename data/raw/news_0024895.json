(AP: Sumaya Hisham) \nCritics condemned an announcement by Mr Zuma's office that 441 members of the military would assist police in maintaining order during the speech and the opening of Parliament. \nThe military has previously deployed for the event, but the security operation was among the largest in recent years. \nMr Zuma has been under scrutiny for an allegedly improper relationship with the Guptas, a business family of Indian immigrants that has been accused of meddling in top government appointments. \nThe President has denied wrongdoing. \nThe President's speech addressed numerous sources of frustration for many South Africans, including the delivery of basic services and an economy that has stalled. \nHe said he expects 1.3 per cent growth in 2017, after just 0.5 per cent last year. \nAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:12:11.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
