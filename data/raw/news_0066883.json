A Palestinian state in Gaza and Sinai. Instead of Judea and Samaria (the historic name for the disputed West Bank).” Kara claimed that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s proposal, which first surfaced in 2014, will be part of a regional peace deal involving Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab nations. “This is how we will pave a path to peace, including with the Sunni coalition,” he enthused. \nTrump and Netanyahu did subsequently announce they planned to pursue a regional deal involving the Sunni countries, one Trump described as “a much more important deal in a sense. It would take in many, many countries and it would cover a very large territory.” Related Trump sets striking new course for Mideast peace process \nSisi in 2014 denied having offered to give up part of the Sinai Peninsula, a land bridge linking Egypt proper and Gaza. His denial would have been credible but for one thing: an outraged Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas soon afterwards announced at a meeting of his Fatah party that he rejected Sisi’s offer. The offer and the rejection were widely reported at the time, including by Ma’an, a leading Palestinian news agency. \nWhatever the truth of the Sisi proposal, the version Kara referred to would have merit for those desiring a stable peace in the Middle East. \nIf the Palestinians were granted a state of their own in the West Bank, the country with the most to fear would be Jordan, not Israel. The Palestinians claim to represent Jordan’s Palestinians — who comprise 70 per cent of the Jordanian population — and would almost certainly try to foment a revolution to overthrow Jordan’s Hashemite monarch, King Abdullah, a U.S. ally. Palestinians did try to overthrow the monarchy in 1970 in the bloody Black September civil war, and that was before they had the military advantages that would come with being a state. \nA Palestinian state in the West Bank would also be unstable because of its geography — it wouldn’t be contiguous with its sister Palestinian territory of Gaza, the statelet created after Israel vacated the strip along Egypt’s Sinai border. The Sinai, on the other hand, is not only contiguous with Gaza, its border city, Rafah, was split during the 1967 Six-Day War into an Egyptian and Palestinian half, separating families and businesses. Carving out part of Sinai to create a home for Palestinians adjacent to Gaza would reunify Rafah and its surrounding Palestinian communities, restoring not only families but a significant crossroads city. \nWesterners are told that Jerusalem and other Holy Lands in the West Bank have monumental religious significance to Muslims. That religious claim is belied by history. Under Muslim control over most of the last 1,000 years, the Holy Lands — which had been prosperous and politically vital under Jewish and Christian rule — became a backwater, poor and derelict, warranting little investment in their upkeep. Jerusalem was never a Muslim capital and unlike cities that are considered by Islam as truly holy, it was neither an important cultural nor scholarly centre for Muslims. \nMoreover, although most Arabs side strongly with Palestinians versus Israelis, they overwhelmingly side against Palestinians otherwise. Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia view Palestinians with suspicion and have ordered mass expulsions of Palestinians in recent history. Most Arabs don’t see the tiny sliver of land that is today called Palestine — a mere one-half of one per cent of all Arab lands — as warranting much attention when so many large-scale Arab tragedies cry out for attention. As noted last month in the respected Saudi weekly Asharq al-Awsat, “Due to the destruction and displacement that has affected the Middle East in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, the Palestinian cause is no longer central.” \nThe Sunni Arab states have entered into a de facto alliance with Israel against the one country they consider an existential threat: Iran. With Trump sharing their animus toward Iran and eager to strike a master deal that would defang both Iran and ISIL, the Arab states, Israel and the U.S. would all see the advantage of ending the distraction of the Palestinian cause by imposing a solution that excludes the West Bank. Palestinians, the world’s largest per capita recipients of foreign aid by far, would have no choice but to comply if they wished to keep the money flowing. The offer of a state in nearby Sinai, just 80 kilometres away, coupled with promises of massive development aid by the West and the Saudis, would be an offer they could not refuse. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:22:06.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
