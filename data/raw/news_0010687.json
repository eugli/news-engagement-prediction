Photo: David Ryder \nDynamic pricing, or targeted pricing, is a strategy whereby retailers change the price of goods in response to supply and demand. \nThink of the way airline seats and hotel rooms are sold, with prices fluctuating depending on the day of the week you buy, or the way Uber applies a surge pricing algorithm to activate in periods of high demand. \nIn another example of the pricing method, in 2012 travel booking site Orbitz found that Mac computer users were 40 per cent more likely to book four to five-star hotels than PC users.The finding led the company to skew a user's search results depending on the type of device they were using. \n\"Dynamic pricing has been around forever, in very crude simplistic ways,\" said Ron Wood, managing director of pricing strategy analyst Pricing Insight. \n\"But as we've moved to a digital world it has taken on far more complex approach. A classic example is retailers like Amazon creating custom purchase algorithms that look at the types of books you buy and the type of freight you select, to predict what you are likely to pay for next purchase.\" \nMr Wood said that the data \"trail of breadcrumbs\" left by consumers on the internet, about their shopping habits, allowed retailers to determine what made consumers spend money. \n\"Most consumers probably don't realise that every single item they buy is tracked...even at the supermarket checkouts of Coles or Woolworths,\" he said. \n\"Sophisticated retailers, like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy, are all undertaking detailed, data-driven analysis of consumer behaviour and Australian retailers are just starting to awake to these possibilities.\" \nMs Lee said that while she fully understood the way targeted pricing was used in different markets, in her case she felt it had been taken one step too far. \n\"Seeing something 'on sale' definitely impacts your decision and triggers an innate feeling of value, so you naturally look for sale products, that is why I think it is deceptive.\" \nNet-a-porter.com has been contacted for comment. \nAccording to Mauricio Escobar, the global head of marketing at eDigital Agency, dynamic pricing does not fit all companies, nor is it in the interest of all consumers. \n\"Dynamic pricing allows companies to be price competitive using the efficiencies of online research to automate pricing changes \"on the fly\"...this means they reduce the risk of missing a sale,\" he said. \n\"Companies only take a big risk if they set different pricing for exactly the same product; [one for] a customer who lives in Sydney's eastern suburbs and [another for] someone who lives in Cairns. They might determine that the person from Sydney is more likely to pay a higher price because of her location and income bracket.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:14:44.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
