File photo The trial over the death of 4-year-old Jihad, who fell into an unsealed pipe of an abandoned deep tube-well in Dhaka, has concluded. \nOn Wednesday, a special judge's court kept its verdict pending for Feb 26 after hearing the closing arguments. \nOn Dec 26, 2014, Jihad fell into a deep tube-well for the Bangladesh Railway at Dhaka’s Shahjahanpur. \nHe fell through the pipe’s 14-inch opening, which was kept unsealed even after it was abandoned. \nRescuers had called off their search after 23 hours, but the locals refused to give up. They finally pulled out Jihad soon afterwards but the child was dead by then. \nDoctors at the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital said then he had died several hours before being taken to the hospital. The 4-year-old boy fell into the abandoned deep tube-well while playing with his friends. Photo taken from family album. The death shook the nation and calls to bring those responsible to justice for keeping the pipe unsealed resonated across the country.\nJihad's father filed a case of death due to negligence with the Shahjanpur police. \nIn April 2015, police filed the chargesheet in court, where it pressed charges on Railway Senior Sub-Assistant Engineer Jahangir Alam, who was in charge of the project and Abdus Salam, the contractor who set up the well. Jiahd fell trough the 14-inch opening of this unsealed pipe.
