Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today: Trump’s rollback of the rights of transgender students, a feckless Rex Tillerson, and the CPAC conference.\nThe Trump administration’s rollback on the bathroom rules for transgender students this week was reportedly driven by Jeff Sessions, over the reservations of Betsy DeVos, with the final decision made in an Oval Office meeting. What do we learn by where Trump’s support came down?\nIt’s not news that America now has a president who will roll back civil rights and endorse bigotry. This is a White House, let us not forget, that refused to either remember or condemn anti-Semitism when purporting to honor Holocaust Remembrance Day . But nonetheless we did learn a little bit more about both Trump and his administration from this chilling decree.\nWe received confirmation (if there were any doubt) that Attorney General Sessions was lying when he made a big show of denying (or at least trying to cover up) his record as a foe of civil-rights enforcement during his Senate hearings. Discarding the rights of transgender students is clearly just a warm-up act for a Justice Department that will work hard to dismantle the rights of other minorities — including the voting rights of African-Americans and any others who might threaten GOP rule at the ballot box. So radical is Sessions that even a hard-right ideologue like DeVos can seem relatively moderate next to him — though only up to a point. Once the Sessions edict prevailed, she quickly fell in line behind it .\nWe also learned that all this talk of members of Trump’s family serving as moderating forces on his worst impulses is hooey. Melania Trump had claimed that her cause as First Lady would be bullying . That was a lost cause before her husband took office — his entire career in business and politics has been a cavalcade of bullying — but now that he has institutionalized bullying as president, she’s an accessory to the crime. (No wonder she entered a witness protection program shortly after the inauguration.) Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, who supposedly intervened to get Daddy to back down from his contemplated reversal of President Obama’s anti-discrimination protections for LGBT Americans, either stayed silent or had no influence this time. Trump wasn’t even loyal to poor Jackie Evancho, the 16-year-old singer who risked ridicule by performing at his Inaugural and has a transgender sister: Evancho was reduced to begging through Twitter for the president to meet with her this week. Equally impotent is Caitlyn Jenner, who pimped for Trump during the campaign, and who could be found yesterday on Twitter releasing a jocular, tone-deaf video reassuring transgender kids they have nothing to fear and inviting the president to call her to discuss his betrayal of his pre-election stand that transgender people should have the right to use whatever “bathroom they feel is appropriate .” Her protest is too tame, too late, and too tainted by her previous Trump sycophancy to aid young transgender Americans who now may be more vulnerable than ever.\nJust as Trump unveiled his new immigration decree — pledging to deport undocumented immigrants to Mexico, whether they are Mexican or not — Rex Tillerson began his first official visit there . Is there room for the secretary of State in the conflict over the border?\nSessions aside, it’s not clear that any cabinet officer has much sway in an administration run by a tight non-cabinet inner circle, most notably Steve Bannon and Kushner. Tillerson’s month at State has been one long humiliation . He has not been present at most of Trump’s meetings with foreign leaders. He has not been available to the press . He has had no discernible effect on foreign policy (to the extent there is a final policy). His attempt to hire his own deputy, Elliot Abrams, ended in embarrassment when the White House blackballed Abrams on the grounds that he had been critical of Trump during the campaign .\nTillerson’s month at State has been one long humiliation. Tillerson’s visit to Mexico this week, accompanied by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, was nothing if not a public confirmation of his irrelevance. Even as he was saying all the appropriate things about the friendship between the United States and Mexico, his boss was back in Washington slurring Mexico once again as a conveyor belt for criminals, toying with the notion of cutting back American aid to Mexico to pay for the wall, and readying a new anti-immigrant edict that would be as toxic to Mexicans as to Muslims. Poor Kelly had to step to a microphone to specifically contradict Trump, promising that there would be “no mass deportations” of illegal immigrants and no “use of military force” against them — both of which the president had been touting . We’ll see how long this stab at independence lasts. Tillerson and Kelly — and quite possibly the widely admired new national security adviser H.R. McMaster — will soon have to put their balls into the same escrow account as Betsy DeVos’s spine.\nSteve Bannon and Reince Priebus took the stage at this week’s CPAC conference, marking a rare public appearance for Bannon and offering the first direct glimpse of their working dynamic . What did you see?\nThis dog-and-pony show was meant to show that these two rivals for White House turf were pacific colleagues, and that therefore all press reports saying otherwise are fake news. The rare glimpse of Bannon in action revealed two things about him: (1) He could roll over the milquetoast clerk Priebus anytime he wanted to; (2) He looks so unhealthy he may not be around long enough to be on hand for that showdown.\nThe fawning questioner at this Bannon-Priebus propaganda event made no mention of Bannon’s role in making a star out of Milo Yiannopoulos , the transgressive provocateur who until his resignation this week was a senior editor at Bannon’s Breitbart News. Yiannopoulos had also been on the bill at the CPAC conference until the world suddenly rediscovered a taped appearance in which he spoke with genuine feeling about the virtues of pedophilia for underage boys. Presumably Bannon knew of his senior editor’s thoughts on that topic — that incriminating public video dated back to early 2016. So far Bannon’s own position on pedophilia remains unknown.\nTags: top story the national circus politics trump administration reince priebus steve bannon jeff sessions rex tillerson More Trump Nixing Transgender Bathroom Rule Is Just the Beginning Trump’s Rollback on Transgender Bathroom Rule Is Just the Beginning Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party Trump’s Health-Care Nightmare Is Only Just Beginning Most Viewed Stories This Obscure News Story, Which Should Be Huge, Shows How Trump Gets Away With Corruption Customs Agents Check Passengers’ IDs on Domestic Flight at JFK Trump Condemns FBI Leakers for Leaking That He Asked Them to Leak Connie Britton Leaves Nashville Fans With the Cold Comfort of a Heartfelt Coda After That Momentous Episode Trump’s Health-Care Nightmare Is Only Just Beginning Vulture’s Final 2017 Oscar Predictions for Every Category Video Games Are Better Than Real Life 15 Stars Reminisce About the Actors Who Used to Beat Them Out for Roles Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party Trump’s Counterterrorism Adviser Sebastian Gorka Has Links to Anti-Semitic Groups Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer The Wildest Moments From Donald Trump’s Press Conference Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 6:19 p.m. New York City Recorded Its Lowest Number of Traffic Fatalities in 2016 A small dip from 2015, but the third-straight yearly decline under Vision Zero.\n6:13 p.m. Democrats Make a Risky Pick for Response to Trump’s Big Speech to Congress Former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear is an out-of-work centrist representing a party that’s energized on the left.\n6:04 p.m. Leaked House Obamacare Repeal Draft Shows Dangerous Work in Progress A leaked document shows House Republicans mulling controversial ideas like ending Medicaid as we know it and a new tax on employer-provided insurance.\n5:42 p.m. Leaked DHS Report Undermines Trump’s Argument for His Travel Ban It says citizenship in the Muslim-majority countries included in the ban is an “unlikely indicator” of a terrorism threat.\n4:50 p.m. GOP Tax Cut Waiting for Trump to Decide on Policy He Clearly Doesn’t Understand Don’t feel bad for Paul Ryan, he’ll end up getting a big tax cut for the rich in the end.\n4:31 p.m. A Bunch of Cities Are Sweating Through the Hottest February Day on Record It’s been a hot month, with nearly 4,500 record highs set, compared to 29 record lows.\n3:51 p.m. Kansas Suspect Allegedly Said ‘Get Out of My Country,’ Then Shot 2 Indian Men The White House denied any links to President Trump’s rhetoric.\n3:39 p.m. White House Bars New York Times , CNN, and Politico From Press Briefing Earlier in the day, Trump explained that the media isn’t the “enemy of the people” — but the fake news media is .\n2:40 p.m. Trump Expected to Pick Man Known For Bad Economic Advice As Top Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett once co-authored a book imploring investors to enter the stock market — just before the dot-com bubble burst.\n2:37 p.m. Trump Offers Conservatives the World — in Exchange for Their Principles Is the mainstream right ready to replace its traditional values with pure nationalism?\n1:04 p.m. Trump’s Rollback on Transgender Bathroom Rule Is Just the Beginning It looked like Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s warm-up act in loosening protections for all minorities.\n12:57 p.m. Trump Praises First Amendment, Calls for Media Suppression and Fewer Protests The president told CPAC the media “shouldn’t be allowed” to cite anonymous sources, and suggested people shouldn’t protest after an election.\n12:23 p.m. Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party “We will not answer to donors, lobbyists, or special interests … now here’s another story about me answering to special interests.”\n11:56 a.m. Trump’s Security Adviser Sebastian Gorka Has Links to Anti-Semitic Groups This may be the lowlight of a week that also saw him make an unhinged phone call to a critic that got recorded and published.\n11:51 a.m. Trump: U.S. Has ‘Fallen Behind’ on Nukes, Vows to Return to ‘Top of the Pack’ This isn’t the first time the president has appeared to advocate for nuclear proliferation.\n9:44 a.m. Trump Condemns FBI Leakers for Leaking That He Asked Them to Leak The White House asked the FBI to leak exculpating details about Trump’s ties with Russia.
