His jokey “Team Thor” personal diary , helmed by his Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi, provided more humor in its brief three-and-a-half minutes than almost any other big-screen superhero effort ever. And now, we’ve been blessed with yet another peek at Thor’s domestic rapport with Darryl, which once again reveals the God of Thunder to be uncomfortable adjusting to everyday life.

Darryl, predictably, isn’t on board with this plan, nor is he cool with Thor’s desire to hire a servant. But if there’s one thing we’ve learned from these personal snapshots of the Avenger, he’s not apt to take the advice of mortals — though he does like to show off his muscles.\nAlso premiering today is a behind-the-scenes look (above) at the work that went into creating the tag featured in the credits of Scott Derrickson’s film. That bonus scene paired Benedict Cumberbatch’s sorcerer with Thor, and should go some way toward integrating Strange into the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe ahead of next year’s mega-team-up Avengers: Infinity War .\nYou can check out both videos above — or via the new Blu-ray of Doctor Strange , which lands in stores on Feb. 28. The film is available on Digital HD on Tuesday.\nRead more: \n‘Wayne’s World’ Turns 25: Director Penelope Spheeris on “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “Foxy Lady,” and Why Wayne and Garth Still Party On 1997 Oscar Flashback!
