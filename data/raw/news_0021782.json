Yes. They have a great squad,” added Conte. \n“There are 14 games to play and five teams as well as us who can fight to win it. It’s important we don’t make mistakes in the race.” \nNAN reports that Chelsea face a trip to Burnley on Sunday for a 13:30 GMT kick-off. \nThe Clarets have won their last seven games at home in all competitions with 28 of their 29 league points so far this season coming at Turf Moor. \n“There are teams at the bottom who win and draw. So, you must have the right concentration,” said Conte. \n“If your ambition is to stay in the top four or top six, you can have highs and lows. \n“If you want to win [the title] you must have concentration and focus and know that in every game you can lose points.’’ adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:20:34.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
