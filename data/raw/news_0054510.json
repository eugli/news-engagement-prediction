In support, he notes one indicator that’s close to getting triggered.\n“If you need additional encouragement that a bear market is not just around the corner, history again may offer some more virtual Valium,” says Stovall, who delivers our call of the day .\nSince 1945, there have been 27 years when the S&P has achieved gains in January and February. The stock index then finished up for the year (on a total-return basis) in every one those years, according to Stovall. That’s going 27 for 27, or batting a thousand.\nThe average rise in those years was 24%, as shown in his chart below.\nCFRA So that bodes well for 2017 — though the chart’s footnote features that favorite Wall Street caveat: “Past performance is no guarantee of future results.”\nPlus, February isn’t over yet, and it’s typically the stock market’s second-worst month of the year. But the S&P is up 3.8% for the month, after rising 1.8% in January.\nAs Stovall puts it, the first two months can “offer a clue that investors believe that good things still lie ahead.”\nKey market gauges Futures for the Dow YMH7, -0.06% , S&P 500 ESH7, -0.16% and Nasdaq-100 NQH7, -0.10% are edging lower, after the Dow DJIA, +0.58% , S&P SPX, +0.60% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.47% all chalked up all-time closing highs again yesterday .\nOil US:CLG7 is giving back some of Tuesday’s gain .
