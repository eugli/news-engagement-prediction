I’m happy to hear from you that the federal government will start work on the Second Niger Bridge this year. \n“Finally, what we are saying here is that we want federal government presence in the Southeast as a whole and in Anambra in particular. \n“We have lacked this presence for a very long time and their presence here will clearly enkindle a sense of belonging and improve major activities in the area,” he said. \nAfter the meeting, the inspection team from the Governor’s lodge moved to sites of inspection, first through the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway to the Second Niger Bridge. \nThe construction was in the early phase, although for two years the contracting firm had registered its presence at the site. \nAccording to the Division Manager of the company, Mr. Hadi Bley, they were awaiting funding for the commencement of construction and the early phase was expected to be completed within eight months and then the main construction would begin. This might likely take 36 to 40 months. \nThe Minister promised that inspection would be constant until the bridge is completed.
