An excerpt from her post read: \"I was in a meeting with the programming head of a leading TV channel. Towards the end of the half hour meeting, he asked me, 'So when can we meet outside?' To which I replied, 'Regarding some other work?' He said, 'No... for other things'.

It does not mean that just because I lead a glamorous life on screen, that I deserve to be spoken with disrespect. It's my life, my body and my wish. No man should assume he can get away with disrespecting me,\" she wrote. \n\"Instead of lecturing women on what to wear, how to speak, and how to behave appropriately, how about we stop telling our men to stop thinking with their genitals, and start look women as strong, free, capable and equal human being. Teach the men to be better people. Every parents need to start this at home,\" she added. \nFirst Published: Tuesday, February 21, 2017 - 14:47 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:57:55.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
