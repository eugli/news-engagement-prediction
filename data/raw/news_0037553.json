Practice goes crazy.” \nPart of that push comes in practice from Sam Daniels , Martin said. The junior guard came off the bench to score eight points, including four in overtime. Senior guard Jamel Billings added 12, including vital plays that sparked the Clippers to a 13-1 run that ended the game. \n“I felt the whole game it was going to be a hard-fought battle to the end,” said Billings, whose three-point play gave Clearview a 65-62 lead. \nThe speedy guard added a steal that pushed the lead to five, and it grew from there. \nJust as they told Szalay when down 12-0 in the first quarter, they were OK. \n“We run the same kind of a game, and it was a matter of who was going to get tired first,” Billings said. \nThe victory marked Clearview’s eighth in a row, but its gauntlet continues Tuesday with a nonconference game against Elyria Catholic — the No. 21-ranked team in the cleveland.com Top 25 . Earlier this week, the Clippers scored a 76-67 win against PAC Stars Division winner Buckeye. \nThey will soon meet again with Clearview seeded fourth in the Division II North Ridgeville District and booked for a March 3 trip to Buckeye in the sectional finals. \nOn this night, Martin, Billings and Co. cut down their nets for a conference championship. They almost didn’t get to do it after facing deficits of 12-0 early and 54-49 late in the fourth. \n“They refuse to lose,” Szalay said. “That’s the biggest thing. They say the right things in the huddle and to each other — and in the right way.” \nOn the other side, Oberlin coach Kurt Russell began to assess what is ahead for his team. The Phoenix won last year’s Division III Wooster District title and is the top seed in that tournament . \n“The one thing about the tournament is you need some momentum,” Russell said, “and we can’t allow this loss to set us back.” \nSenior forward Donald Johnson led Oberlin with 18 points and 14 rebounds. \nContact sports reporter Matt Goul on Twitter ( @mgoul ) or email ( ).
