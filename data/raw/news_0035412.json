We have a supply chain or a logistic system in this state that has worked really well, but the problem is we have milked it fairly heavily,\" he said. \n\"We have produced 40 per cent of our export income from the regions. If this is your most profitable machine you need to look after it.\" Photo: Repair bills from the damage are expected to stretch into the tens of millions of dollars. (Supplied: Corina Harp/Ravensthorpe Agricultural Innovation Network) \nMr Dumesny said the simple act of maintaining a road would put money back into the state's economy. \n\"We produce 70 per cent of Australia's gold, yet we are the second highest-cost gold producer in the world â€” one of the key drivers for that is our transport and logistics costs,\" he said. \n\"The freight sector to our economy is critical and it is often unrecognised. We need a WA approach to strategic freight planning.\" Call for greater vision from leaders \nBusinesses in the Goldfields are also calling for a better vision for WA supply routes. \nKalgoorlie-Boulder Chamber of Commerce CEO Hugh Gallagher said that a new policy needed to be developed to help accommodate the current demands on major routes. \n\"It's very commonplace in this part of the region, and in the Midwest and Wheatbelt, for triple road trains to frequent our roads but we are not accounting for that in the policies that we have,\" Mr Gallagher said. \nHe said the WA section of the Great Eastern Highway, which links Perth to the eastern states, had become a dangerous road. \n\"We are getting bigger and bigger vehicles, but they are running on roads that were built many years ago for just day-to-day traffic,\" Mr Gallagher said. \n\"So the fundamentals of the road transport in the regions are changing.\" \nHe said improving and maintaining the major supply routes will help to boost WA's economy. \n\"All of these trucks that we are talking about, they are actually delivering dividends to Western Australia,\" he said. \n\"We need to look after industry so they can generate royalties for us and underpin the economy of Western Australia. \n\"Sometimes you do need to spend a quid to make a quid.\" Critical infrastructure washed away \nIn the East Kimberley, the wet season has once again washed away critical transport links. \nHalls Creek shire CEO Rodger Kerr-Newell said it had brought mines and cattle stations to a halt. \n\"It's just a complete, giant mud puddle,\" he said. \n\"For the last two months and counting, we have seen major gold producers like Newmont's Granite Mine who haven't been able to get their fuel. \n\"We are seeing the same on the Tanami Road with the cattle stations, Ruby in particular.\" \nMr Kerr-Newell said that they had been calling for the Tanami Road, which connects Halls Creek to Alice Springs, to be properly surfaced for more than two decades. \n\"It was in a really good state about four months ago,\" he said. \n\"Then it rains, it all washes away, and we spend a great deal of the taxpayers' money getting it back to the state it was in. \n\"Then it rains again and it all washes away. It's a never ending cycle.\" \nHe said turning the road into an all-weather road would create an important tourism and supply link. Opposition says road planning essential \nShadow transport spokesperson Rita Saffioti said a strategic freight plan was critical for Western Australia. \n\"WA Labor believes sensible transport planning is essential in WA, particularly in the regions where transport is the lifeblood of communities and commerce,\" she said. \n\"The effective movement of freight is a key driver of economic growth and opportunities in the regions.\" \nWA Transport Minister Bill Marmion said Main Roads was continuing to implement a long-term strategy to fix the state's ageing road infrastructure. \n\"This includes road resurfacing, new bridges and extensive maintenance,\" he said. \nMr Marmion said the works included major projects that would rebuild large sections of the road network used by the freight industry. \nFederal Transport Minister Darren Chester was contacted for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:55:21.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
