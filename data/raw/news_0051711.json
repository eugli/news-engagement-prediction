Camden Council. \nA London council is to launch an independent public inquiry into whether a hugely popular cycle route should be scrapped. \nThe central London cycling lane has been welcomed by thousands of cyclists but is loathed by taxi drivers who have called for it to be removed. \nThe two roads in Bloomsbury , Tavistock Place and Torrington Place, were reduced to one lane in November 2015 as part of a 12-month pilot scheme. \nThe new layout saw the Camden route become one-way for all vehicles with the extra space given to cyclists amid concerns of bike overcrowding. \nIt became massively popular, leading to a 52 per cent boost in the number of cyclists on the stretch of road, which links Tottenham Court Road and Islington . Two-way: The Tavistock Place cycle lane was doubled after concerns of overcrowding. (Scott Jenkins) \nBut taxi drivers claim the controversial one-way system is a nightmare and is slowing journeys because of increased congestion from the lack of space. \nOver 15,000 people and groups gave their views in Camden council’s six-week public consultation on the flagship scheme – the largest number of responses ever received by the council on one issue. \nOut of the individuals who responded, 79 per cent backed the current one-way layout and want it to become permanent but one fifth - including the taxi drivers and a group of residents - think it should be scrapped.
