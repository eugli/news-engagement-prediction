Normally, around the age of 60-65 years, an elephant loses its molars. \n“Indria was on a soft food diet for almost two decades. About 15 years ago, she lost sight in one eye and about a month ago, she developed a cataract in the other eye.” \nThe secret to Indria's long life may have been her eating a lot of greens, staff added. photobombing animals \nT he elephant was cremated, leaving a total of 22 elephants at the camp. \nAccording to Guinness World Records (GWR), the oldest elephant ever kept in captivity was officially Lin Wang, an Asian elephant, who died on 26 February 2003 aged 86, at Taipei Zoo, Taiwan. \n“Grandpa Lin, as he became known, carried supplies through the jungles of Myanmar (formerly Burma) for the Japanese army, during World War II,” GWR said. \n“He was even taken prisoner by the Chinese in 1943. Lin Wang retired to the Zoo in 1954. The average age of an Asian elephant is 60 years.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T13:47:37.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
