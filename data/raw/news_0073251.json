Steve Ballmer (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:44 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:44 p.m. ET \nStan Kroenke's idea all along with his land in Inglewood was to create a sports and entertainment complex, not just an NFL stadium. \nCould the Clippers become the NBA neighbors of the Rams? \nClippers owner Steve Ballmer and Kroenke have held discussions about the Clippers leaving Staples Center and moving to Inglewood, according to the Los Angeles Times . \nMORE: Roger Goodell discusses painful team relocation \nThe Times cited five sources that said a potential Clippers arena \"could either be on the 298-acre site or an adjacent parcel\" near the Rams' new $2.6 billion stadium, which is scheduled to open in 2019 and will host the Super Bowl LV on Feb. 7, 2021. The Clippers have shared Staples Center with the Lakers since 1999. \nNeither the Rams nor the Clippers offered comment to the Times. \nBallmer, the former Microsoft CEO, and Kroenke, a real-estate mogul, are two of the richest owners in sports. A partnership between the two could complicate the Chargers' expected move into the Rams' new stadium in 2019. The Chargers announced a move from San Diego to L.A. in January, but will spent two seasons at StubHub Center in Carson before joining the Rams in Inglewood.
