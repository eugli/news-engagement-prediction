And the “outraged” media blasted Trump for “Islamophobia.” \nCNN, NBC, ABC and MSNBC all ran reports on her claims. \nThen we found out the truth.. .she told a bold-faced lie , and the Fake Media, to no one’s surprise, ran with it! \nFrom Washington Examiner : \nThe problem, however, is that the alleged detaining apparently occurred in December, before Trump had even been sworn in as America’s 45th president. \nWhen caught on the dates, Muhammad noted casually several days after her Feb. 7 interview that she meant last year when she said, “just a few weeks ago.” \nTo put it plainly, claims that Trump’s temporary immigration ban ensnared an American champion appear to be totally false , and by that champion’s own admission. \nSo Obama’s DHS detained her — if the incident even happened at all — and yet the media blamed it on Trump, and smeared him by saying it was because she was a Muslim. \nShould we be surprised? After all this is the same media which also created a massive “scandal” over fake campaign ads they claimed Trump’s father made in 1969 — only to have those absurd claims blow up in their faces . \nMainstream media IS Fake Media. Joseph Stalin never had a media this compliant. \nAnd what price will Ms. Muhammad pay for her lie? PLEASE SHARE this if you agree that Ibtihaj Muhammad should be THROWN OFF the U.S. fencing team for her outrageous lie…", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T07:34:11.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
