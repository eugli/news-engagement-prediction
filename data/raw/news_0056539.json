In Massachusetts, however, those students may not be impacted by the decision like those in other states.\nView Story Walsh blasts Trump over transgender policy Mayor Walsh called the move “reckless” and said it undermines the promise of civil rights.\nThat’s because Baker in July signed into law a transgender public accommodations law that allows people in Massachusetts to use bathroom facilities based on their gender identity. The governor signed the state law after months of criticism for his ambiguity on the controversial issue\nSpeaking at the press conference Thursday, which was held to swear-in a black advisory committee to advise the governor on matters of diversity and inclusion, the governor said he is glad the state’s law is in place.\nAdvertisement\n“I do believe that here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts... kids are going to be protected and kids are going to be able to feel safe and secure in the communities they live in and the schools the go to,” Baker said.\nThe topic again puts Baker in a tough spot with the national party. The Republican governor has said he did not vote in the presidential election and has sought to distinguish himself from the new President.\nLaura Krantz can be reached at laura.krantz@globe.com .
