The film follows three volunteer rescue workers as they put everything on the line to save civilians affected by the war. Trailer: Netflix . \nKhatib was scheduled to arrive on Saturday in Los Angeles on a Turkish Airlines flight departing from Istanbul. But his plans have been upended after US officials reported finding \"derogatory information\" regarding him. \nDerogatory information is a broad category that can include anything from terror connections to passport irregularities. Asked for comment, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, Gillian Christensen, said: \"A valid travel document is required for travel to the United States.\" SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Syrian boy Omran Daqneesh, seen here in footage from the pro-rebel Aleppo Media Centre, is one of many civilians rescued with the help of Syrian Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets. Photo: AP \nThe White Helmets , a 40-minute Netflix documentary, has been nominated for Best Documentary Short. If the film wins the Oscar, the award would go to director Orlando von Einsiedel and producer Joanna Natasegara. Khatib is one of three people credited for cinematography. \nThe film focuses on the rescue workers of the Syrian Civil Defence , who risk their lives to save Syrians affected by civil war. Many of the group's members have been killed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's air forces. The group was also nominated for last year's Nobel Peace Prize.

This is @995Khaled 's story: https://t.co/M6HSR5Bd1o pic.twitter.com/gbjII5FrnX — The Syria Campaign (@TheSyriaCmpgn) February 20, 2017 \nHe continued filming, though. \"It's easy for anyone to kill someone, but it's very hard and very difficult to save lives,\" he told CNN. \nKhatib had been issued a visa to attend the ceremony with Hollywood's biggest stars. But Turkish authorities detained him this week, according to the internal US government correspondence, and he suddenly needed a passport waiver from the United States to enter the country. \nReached by telephone, Khatib said he was in Istanbul and had not been detained. He declined to speak further about his situation. And a posting on the White Helmets' Twitter account said that \"sadly\", Khatib would not be able to attend the Oscars \n\"Not allowed to leave Turkey because passport not issued by Damascus,\" according to the tweet. After 3days at airport, not allowed to travel to #oscars2017 - had US visa - but passport not accepted. Sad, but important work to do here. — Khaled Khatib (@995Khaled) February 25, 2017 \nAs recently as last week, Khatib said he planned to travel to Los Angeles for the Oscars in the hopes that a win would inspire those back home. \n\"If we win this award, it will show people across Syria that people around the world support them,\" Khatib said on Facebook. \"It will give courage to every volunteer who wakes up every morning to run towards bombs. \n\"If I cannot enter the US, I will not give up: we know that we have many friends in US, that there are people that share our humanitarian values. I look forward to meeting them all one day.\" \nKhatib is not the only person whose Oscars travel plans were affected by Trump's executive order. Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose film The Salesman is up for an Academy Award for best foreign film, said in January he would not attend the awards ceremony as a way to protest the \"unjust conditions\" of Trump's travel ban. \nAP, Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T10:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T05:29:42.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
