The matter was closed by the AHRC in November after the complainant dropped the case.\nGiving evidence to Senate estimates on Tuesday, Triggs said the commission had twice written to Leak giving him the opportunity to assert that he had drawn the cartoon in good faith.\nSection 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act specifies publication “done reasonably and in good faith” as a defence against a racial discrimination complaint under section 18C. Advocates who have been campaigning to amend or scrap section 18C have said such defences are inadequate .\nLeak did not respond to the commission, despite publicly explaining that his cartoon was intended to explore social issues in Indigenous communities such as absence of parental supervision leading to juvenile crime – exactly the sort of public interest debate 18D was designed to protect.\nNo investigation into Bill Leak cartoon after complaint dropped Read more\n“Had he responded by making a good faith point, we would almost certainly have ended the matter precisely at that moment,” Triggs said, in response to questions from the independent senator Derryn Hinch. “Despite these two requests to him to justify an 18D basis for the cartoon, we received no response.”\nTriggs said the matter was handled speedily and the only delay was waiting for Leak’s response.\n“It may very well be fair comment, it may very well be in good faith, it may well be part of an artistic exercise, it may well be accurate,” she said. “All of those things, however ... have to be put by the respondent themselves.”\nHinch suggested this was too onerous, because cartoonists could have to justify satirical drawings “every day”.\nThe attorney general, George Brandis, said Triggs herself had called for improvements to the commission’s processes, to allow the president to terminate complaints off their own motion.\n“The direct answer to your question ‘why was this allowed’ to happen is ... because the process has become the punishment,” Brandis said.\nMelissa Dinnison, who brought the complaint against Leak, said after dropping it that he and his lawyers had “made it clear they weren’t going to co-operate with the conciliation process” in an effort to coax her to take the matter to court .\n“So I began to feel that I was being used to push an agenda and I felt that the Australian wanted to coax me into taking this to court because they were confident they would win,” she said.\nThe Senate committee examining 18C was due to report on Tuesday afternoon and float a range of reform options for the Turnbull government to consider.\nOn Monday Guardian Australia reported the committee was intent on a bipartisan report recommending the government consider a spectrum of policy change, ranging from minimal tweaks to the AHRC’s complaints handling procedures for 18C cases, to significant amendments to sections 18C and 18D of the legislation.\nIn estimates, the Liberal senator Ian MacDonald continued to probe the commission’s handling of another 18C complaint, against students at the Queensland University of Technology.\nTriggs repeated her evidence given to another committee in February that the AHRC did not contact the students earlier because the complaint appeared to be substantially against the university. Both the complainant and university did not want the students informed until the case had a chance to settle, she said.\nBrandis suggested the students had been denied natural justice because for 11 months they were not told about the complaint, an “unacceptably long period of time”.\n“The complaint against the university relied as one of its key material grounds upon statements allegedly made by the students,” he said. “So in progressing the complaint against the university, [the complainant] was materially accusing these students of making racist statements – that’s a serious thing to allege.\n“I would have thought that the principles of natural justice require that they be made aware of that allegation.”\nGillian Triggs Australian politics Coalition Liberal party News Corporation Australian media news Reuse this content", "external_links": ["https://ipa.org.au/portal/uploads/IPA_Submission_The_Case_for_the_Repeal_of_Section_18C_09122016.pdf", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Faustralia-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F28%2Fbill-leak-could-have-ended-18c-complaint-earlier-says-gillian-triggs", "http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18d.html", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Bill%20Leak%20could%20have%20ended%2018C%20complaint%20earlier%2C%20says%20Gillian%20Triggs&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Faustralia-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F28%2Fbill-leak-could-have-ended-18c-complaint-earlier-says-gillian-triggs%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Bill%20Leak%20could%20have%20ended%2018C%20complaint%20earlier%2C%20says%20Gillian%20Triggs&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Faustralia-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F28%2Fbill-leak-could-have-ended-18c-complaint-earlier-says-gillian-triggs", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Faustralia-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F28%2Fbill-leak-could-have-ended-18c-complaint-earlier-says-gillian-triggs%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Faustralia-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F28%2Fbill-leak-could-have-ended-18c-complaint-earlier-says-gillian-triggs%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;wwc=1"], "published": "2017-02-28T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:28:44.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
