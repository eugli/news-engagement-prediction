Rick Snyder's office this afternoon. \nSnyder has asked that all decisions be ready by May, though some could be announced sooner. Originally, the state had said final decisions on closure would come late this month or early March. \nThe state last month identified the 38 schools for potential closure because they've ranked in the bottom 5% academically for three straight years. \nBut the identification of the schools has touched off outrage across the state. Rallies and town hall meetings have been held in the city to push back against the potential closures. The Detroit Public Schools Community District, which has 16 schools on the list, has threatened a lawsuit. And Kalamazoo Public Schools has filed a lawsuit. \nRead more: Detroit school board may sue Michigan in possible school closures \nSchools could avoid closure if the state determines there aren't better performing schools nearby for students to attend. For those schools, the state would impose an intervention, such as the appointment of a CEO to take over the academics. \nSnyder said in the release that more time and work is needed to determine the best course of action. \n\"The entire team at the School Reform Office has worked diligently to analyze data, visit schools and review potential options, but we need to do more before any final decisions can be made,\" Snyder said. \n\"Any action we take will have long-lasting consequences and we need to take the time to get this right,\" Snyder said. \nSnyder said he is also asking the school reform office — which he pulled from the Michigan Department of Education two years ago — to work closely with the MDE and State Superintendent Brian Whiston. \nContact Lori Higgins: 313-222-6651, lhiggins@freepress.com or @LoriAHiggins 13 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:48:41.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
