His wife is smokin hot, doesn't nag him, and professes undying love, while cooking him hot meals & letting him smoke cigars & drink brown water in the house. His 2 boys, Michael T & Crockett, have been called the most wonderful kids ever (by him), and they're young enough to still think he's cool and are willing to be seen in public with him. Michael Berry has a beard you can hide a French car in and shows no signs of male pattern baldness, his testosterone levels are those of a 17-year-old and his bad cholesterol level is no longer near-fatal (both due to modern medicine), but he has untreated acid reflux that affects his voice on occasion.Named Top 25 talk hosts in America by NewsMax Magazine.
