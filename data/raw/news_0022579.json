Rachel Morgan, pictured when she was six months pregnant with her second baby in 2015 \nShe added: “There no words to describe the pain I feel over losing Rachel - life will never be the same again without my beautiful girl.” \nJill told how her Rachel had always been a strong, capable young woman who had coped well with the challenges of becoming a mum aged 17, and raising a child with complex needs. \nBut when Rachel, from Bolton, gave birth to her second baby around 10 years later, she started to suffer with severe postnatal depression and psychotic episodes. \nShe was found unresponsive on a mental health ward after being sectioned days earlier. \nAn inquest revealed a series of failings and missed opportunities in Rachel’s health care in the months leading up to her death. \nDuring six days of evidence at Stockport Coroner’s Court, a jury heard how Rachel fell ill shortly after her second baby was born in September 2015. A month later she told her mum she was having disturbing visions of her newborn baby being thrown out of a window and run over. Rachel was being looked after as a potential suicide risk at Trafford General Hospital \nJill took Rachel to see her family GP where she asked if she could be suffering with postpartum psychosis - a severe episode of mental illness which occurs suddenly in the days or weeks after having a baby. \nBut after being warned off ‘going down that route’ by her doctor, she was diagnosed with depression, prescribed Diazepam and sent home. \nJill said the doctor’s comments left Rachel terrified of being labelled as ‘mad’ or of going into hospital and never coming out again. \nShe said: “Rachel was a brilliant mum. She was resilient and she coped well. Samaritans offer a helpline 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for those who wish to seek advice. Call 116 123 if you would like to speak to someone.

Everything had to be the best. \n“It was when she gave birth that she started suffering with a low mood. She coped initially. But then started having low moods and having these visions.” \nAs Rachel’s mental health problems deteriorated, she became more detached from her baby.

In January 2016, Rachel was found by police ‘ready to jump’ from Barton Bridge. \nJill said what Rachel really wanted was to be referred to a special mother and baby unit at Wythenshawe Hospital. \nMedics at the Medlock Ward at Trafford General made the referral to Wythenshawe in January, yet the move was ‘put on hold’ by social workers. Rachel was desperate to be transferred to a specialist mother and baby unit at Wythenshawe Hospital \nJill said: “Rachel thought that would be the best place for her and her baby. \n“It was like they were dangling in front of her. But it never happened.” \nWatch: How to talk to your GP about mental health...
