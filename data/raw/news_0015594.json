Photo: Jesse Marlow \nKudos Studios employs 10 staff and turns over about $1.5 million a year. \n\"We are a graphic design business so we have a lot of artistic people and a lot of people with different views and relationships and we are more than happy for them to be given the same rights as anyone else,\" Wallace says. Advertisement \nThe same-sex marriage plebiscite was blocked in Parliament last year but Liberal Party MPs who support same-sex marriage will push to abandon the government's plebiscite policy over the next fortnight in favour of a free vote on the floor of Parliament. \nThe Liberal Party MPs' stance reflects the views of the majority of the 1000 small and medium businesses surveyed with 87 per cent believing Federal Parliament passing marriage equality laws would have either a positive impact on their business or no impact at all. \nOnly 2 per cent say it would have a negative impact. \nOf the business leaders surveyed, the results were even stronger when asked about their own views with more than two thirds (67 per cent) saying they personally supported marriage equality. \nSensis chief executive John Allan says: \"Much has been spoken about large corporates and organisations supporting marriage equality, the evidence is now in that small and medium businesses – the back bone of the Australian economy – also support this important initiative. \n\"Diversity is critically important to the prosperity of our nation and distracting issues such as marriage equality only serves to draw people away from what they believe is truly important, building a future for themselves, their employees and their families.\" \nIt's such a simple thing to sort out. Peter Wallace \nThe survey also found more than six in 10 (61 per cent) small and medium businesses believe they have a diverse workforce. \nWhile the majority (96 per cent) of business owners or managers spoke English as a first language, nearly six in 10 (59 per cent) say they have a multicultural workforce.
