I will save my judgement on this phone, but it's obviously aimed at a consumer that in no way resembles me or my tastes. I can respect that. The Nokia 3 will cost €139 (~$147 USD). \nAlso announced at the event was Nokia's commitment to software. Each of these three phones will run a \"pure, secure, and up-to-date\" software experience, which means a clean, simple UI. All of them will come with Google Assistant and unlimited Photos storage, as well as Nougat out of the box. \nYou can expect to see the Nokia 6, 5, and 3 become available globally in Q2 this year. Nokia 3310 \nBut, wait. Nokia is also bringing back the revered 3310, the most memed phone ever. With a new design, 22 hours of talk time, and a month in standby, the 3310 is really a flash to the past for me. It also features a refreshed Snake, for what that's worth. The 3310 will cost €49 (~$52 USD), but keep in mind that it doesn't run Android. I just thought it's worth mentioning here because, well, the 3310 is back! \nSo that is all of the important stuff from Nokia's press conference at MWC. Even though HMD Global is behind the helm of the phone stuff, it is still nice to see Nokia's name in the Android world (other than the Microsoft thing ). Plus, there is a strong focus on design and upholding the trust and reliability that we associate with Nokia. I am excited to see what the 6, 5, and 3 bring to the table. If you're interested in the new vision going forward, check out the videos below.
