It's a survival tale set on top of a giant collection of water we call the ocean.The production is convincing and maintains immersion. I thought the casting was perfect, and the actors do an excellent job conveying their characters.I scored the film high because I felt it presented different aspects of the human spirit which is observed through the characters response and interaction to the situation, themselves and each other. There is no waste or filler in the film, everything is well paced and contributes to the story which is well written.I love stumbling on rare gems like this. 9 of 12 people found this review helpful.
