Photo: Megan Latham stood down in November 2016 when an ICAC restructure was announced. (AAP: Dean Lewins) \nThe ICAC is warning again that it will not be able to investigate as many complaints as it used to. \nIn response to questions from the ABC's PM program, a spokesman said \"the 2015-2016 annual report notes that the cuts will inevitably see some reduction in the commission's capacity to respond to complaints, and there may be a corresponding reduction in the number of full investigations carried out in a year\". \nThat warning was originally issued by former ICAC chief Megan Latham. \nMs Latham would have been forced to re-apply for her own position. \nThe ICAC is currently led by acting commissioner Reginald Blanch QC while the restructure takes place. \nMr Blanch was the state's first director of public prosecutions (DPP). \nIn 1994, he was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of NSW, before being appointed chief judge of the District Court from 1994 until his retirement from that position in 2014. Panel yet to interview commissioners \nIt is unclear when the restructure will be complete. \nThe Government has established a panel to conduct what it says is \"an extensive, merit-based search to secure three world-class individuals for the state's anti-corruption watchdog\". \nThe recruitment panel includes former judge Roger Gyles QC, businesswoman and lawyer Rebecca Davies, and the head of the Department of Premier and Cabinet, Blair Comley. \nThe panel has met twice since December, but has yet to interview any potential commissioners. \nA shortlist of candidates will be given to Cabinet for consideration, but any appointments remain subject to the approval of a parliamentary oversight committee. \nIn the meantime, it is unclear what work is underway by remaining ICAC staff. \nThe statement from ICAC to PM suggests most of the staff who left did so under a voluntary redundancy scheme in mid-2016. \nThere are no public hearings scheduled for 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:53:34.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
