Paul Newman (left) and Steve McQueen during filming for The Towering Inferno in which they shared star billing Credit: Rex Andrew Frankel 21 February 2017 • 12:26pm \nI f you look at the original poster for The Towering ­Inferno you will see Paul Newman’s name above that of Steve McQueen, but McQueen’s image to the left of Newman’s. This did not happen by chance: in the sole major film the two biggest stars of the Seventies appeared in together, it was the only way that equal billing could be assured. But they have something other than a big-budget disaster movie in common: both loved to race cars. \nThink of a Hollywood actor who raced and an image of Steve McQueen will float before your eyes. He was a racing legend, a man so obsessed with the sport he not only made a film about the Le Mans 24 Hours, but also raced at a very high level. So high indeed that at the Sebring 12 Hours in 1970 (with Le Mans and the Daytona 24 Hours, one of the holy trinity of sports car racing), he failed to win only because Ferrari put future Formula One World Champion Mario Andretti into a car he was not originally scheduled to drive, to pip McQueen’s Porsche at the post. And McQueen drove with a foot in plaster. It’s such an incredible story, it’s a wonder no one has made it into a film. McQueen raced a Porsche at Sebring with his left foot in plaster Credit: Rex \nB ut was he the best driver ever to come out of Tinseltown? Perhaps not. Before Newman makes his appearance here I should first cast a slightly different light on the well-known story above, which tells the truth and nothing but the truth, but is some distance from the whole truth. First, the plastered foot had only the clutch pedal to kick. Then there’s Peter Revson, a full-time professional racing driver hired by McQueen to be his co-driver. McQueen did the minimum amount of driving required of a team-mate to be classified as a participant [at Sebring], but Peter Revson did the lion’s share \nA s Andretti later put it: “I loved and respected Peter Revson, and I actually felt bad for him. If anyone deserved to win that race, it was him. But Steve McQueen would have wrongly received all the accolades… he wasn’t anywhere near as quick as Peter. \n“McQueen did the minimum amount of driving required of a team-mate in order to be classified as a participant, but Revson did the lion’s share.” \nThe truth is McQueen’s Porsche didn’t nearly win at Sebring because he was driving, it lost Sebring because McQueen was driving. Had Revson been paired with anyone of remotely similar talent, Andretti would never have got near him. Newman raced a vicious Porsche 935 in the very wet 1979 Le Mans 24 Hours - and finished second Credit: Rex \nS o what about Paul Newman? True, McQueen’s Inferno co-star never raced a car with a limb in plaster – instead, he had a rather more serious impediment that would affect his entire career behind the wheel: he didn’t start competing seriously until he was in his 50s, whereas McQueen was 50 when he died. \nNewman began racing for fun in the United States in the Seventies, and while he’d have been the first to admit he was not a natural, that is not quite the prerequisite you might expect. It has long been held in racing circles that Graham Hill won his two F1 world titles more through grit and application than an inherent raw talent. \nImportantly, Newman loved every minute behind the wheel and worked hard to master the craft. And he started to win. He won races in TransAm and in races held by the SCCA – the Sports Car Club of America. Steve McQueen in the famous car chase scene in Bullitt Credit: Rex \nB ut he never made much noise about it until overwhelmed by the desire to drive at Le Mans, an event McQueen may have made a film about, but never raced in. It was 1979 and, paired with team owner Dick Barbour and F1 star Rolf Stommelen, Newman was to drive a Porsche. \nBut it wasn’t the delightfully sweet-handling Porsche 908 McQueen enjoyed at Sebring nine years earlier; it was a 935, a rather different kind of Porsche with more than double the power, delivered in a vicious kick by a turbocharged engine and a well-earned reputation for punishing without mercy those who made a mistake. And at Le Mans that year, it rained. And rained. \nLike McQueen but in immeasurably tougher circumstances, Newman didn’t put a foot wrong. He, too, was not as fast as his illustrious team-mates, but he did his fair share, never shirked a stint in difficult conditions and helped the car finish second. And instead of taking all the credit, his simple view of his contribution was: “I didn’t drive too well today.” Newman was adept on two wheels, too Credit: Alamy \nA ppalled by the attention that followed his every move in France – he said he felt like a piece of meat – Newman never raced outside the US again. But on home turf he raced on and on, coming second again that very year at Watkins Glen sharing with Stommelen, proving that Le Mans had been no fluke. At the age of 70, Newman took a podium finish and class win at the Daytona 24 Hours, and at 80 – yes, 80 – he raced there again \nA t the age of 70, a time associated more with pipes and slippers than ­racing and race cars, he took a podium finish and class win at the Daytona 24 Hours, and at 80 – yes, 80 – he raced there again, sharing with F1 driver ­Sébastien Bourdais and IndyCar star Cristiano da Matta. \nHe did his last race in September 2007, less than a year before his death and, aged 82, he won it. \nDuring all this he founded Newman Haas Racing and turned it into one of the most successful IndyCar teams in the history of the sport, winning more than 100 races and eight championships. McQueen is famed for his motorcycling exploits in The Great Escape - although the famous stunt in which his character attempted to jump the wire into Switzerland was performed by his friend and fellow bike nut Bud Ekins Credit: Rex \nD espite all this I still rate McQueen’s as the greater natural talent. He had more instinctive flair and a real aptitude for riding motorcycles on dirt. But to me that makes Newman’s achievements all the more admirable, for he made the most of what he had. By contrast, and despite living another 10 years, after Sebring McQueen never competed in another major race. Steve McQueen vs paul Newman people grid \nI ’m not saying McQueen didn’t do well behind the wheel, that he wasn’t a brave and skilled driver, but I’m certain his reputation as the only actor to really be able to cut it behind the wheel (at least until today’s multiple Le Mans participant Patrick Dempsey) is not justified. \nTaking it all into account, I’d place Newman’s name not only above McQueen’s, but slightly to the left, too. \nFor all the latest news, advice and reviews from Telegraph Cars, sign up to our weekly newsletter by entering your email here", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:32:05.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
