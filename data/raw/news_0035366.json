The yellow is seriously bright and looks awesome,” Holdsworth said. \n“It won’t be hard to spot the Preston Hire car on track.” Lee Holdsworth’s new Preston Hire Racing Supercars livery for 2017.

We are so excited to go racing at Clipsal and I think we are in for a really good year.” Lee Holdsworth’s new Preston Hire Racing Supercars livery for 2017.
