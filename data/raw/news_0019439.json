If Trump sees the missed call and wants to talk, he’ll hit the caller back on his Secret Service–approved line. This is more than just a way to talk shop with those who might otherwise fall out of Trump’s orbit, but like sending tweets from the same phone , it’s a “small triumph over a bureaucratic and security apparatus designed to rein” him in, Allen writes.
