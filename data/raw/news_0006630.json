It was supposed to be raffled off during an annual fundraiser to support the rink. \nJody Nehring with the Asquith community sports center said Tuesday that the theft has been particularly hard on kids who use the rink. \nNehring told 650 CKOM \"there were a lot of tears shed\" and said the children are \"devastated.\" Without the funds from raffling the Howe jersey, they may not get to play hockey next year, she said. \nNehring believes the jersey was specifically targeted in the theft. The uniform was on display while tickets were sold and then locked in a back room. \nThe jersey had been donated by one of Howe's relatives. \nHowe died June 10, 2016, at the age of 88. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
