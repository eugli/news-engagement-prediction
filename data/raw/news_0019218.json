(salajean/Getty Images/iStockphoto) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday,  51 PM \nA stolen marble fragment from an ancient Greek sarcophagus was recovered by Manhattan prosecutors and returned Friday for eventual display in an Athens museum. \nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. handed back the irreplaceable second-century artifact at a repatriation ceremony with Greek Consul General Konstantinos Koutras. \nThe piece depicting a battle between Greek and Trojan fighters was stolen from Greece in 1988, smuggled across Europe and finally brought to New York, officials said. \n“Sadly, in the past, our country has suffered from cruel and continued smuggling of its antique artifacts,” said Koutras. “I wish to extend my heartfelt thanks to (Vance) for his contribution to this achievement, as we proudly accept a part of our heritage.” \nManhattan prosecutors, in collaboration with international investigators, reclaimed the ancient marble piece from an unidentified gallery in Midtown last month. \nThe business was unaware of the fragment’s provenance, and immediately turned the piece over when informed of its crooked past, according to Vance’s office. \nThe nearly 2,000-year-old artifact will be returned to Athens and the National Archeological Museum.
