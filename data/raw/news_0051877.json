(Eddy Kennedy/CBC)\nAfter 32 years as a mainstay on the George Street strip, the place now sits empty.\n\"We're all out of work, for six weeks, with no income,\" said Gulliver.\nInside the bar, the beer taps have been wrapped with NLC tape and the coolers are bare — and it will stay that way for six weeks.\n\"There were violations that took place within this bar, within this building, and I can't dispute those,\" he said.\n'I had to accept responsibility' But Gulliver said all but two of the violations happened at a bar called Levels that operated above Trapper John's.\n\"According to the corporation, because I extended my licence from Trapper John's to the bar above me ... I had to accept the responsibility.\"\nExtending the licence allowed the bars to open a door between the two floors, and increased the capacity for Levels.\nGulliver had no idea the Liquor Control Act was being violated upstairs, he said.\nTrapper John's owner Terry Gulliver speaks about liquor license suspension 4:08\n\"These infractions were not discovered by the normal, regular liquor inspectors that we see all the time.

I was never given the opportunity to put a stop to it.'\"\nAccording to Greg Gill, representative for the NLC, the vast majority of inspections are scheduled, with licensees knowing in advance of the meeting and what items will be addressed.\nTerry Gulliver is taking the six weeks to repaint and do some renovations to Trapper John's. (Eddy Kennedy/CBC)\nSeveral factors come into play when the NLC decides to do a surprise inspection, he said, including \"a review of the licensee's risk rating based on previous infractions, whether NLC has received a formal complaint or if NLC has received specific information that would lead to an investigation.\"\nAs for the undercover inspectors, Gill said the NLC won't comment on the specifics of an inspection.\nGill said Trapper John's has been sanctioned in the past, but could not say how many violations there were.\nIn an effort to lessen the blow, Gulliver said he contacted the NLC to see if the suspension could be broken up, but was told it had to be consecutive weeks.\nHe said he fears repercussions for speaking out against the corporation but wanted to have his say.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:27:57.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
