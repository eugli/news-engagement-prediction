Says Her Photographer “Accidentally Invented Sea Punk” in 2010 She also still holds a grudge against New York Times writer Lynn Hirschberg, calls her a “bitch” M.I.A. Photo by David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images \nM.I.A. has taken to Instagram to share a press photo from 2010, claiming in the caption that the photographer who took the picture “kinda accidentally invented sea punk photos.” She includes in the caption a passage from writer Lynn Hirschberg’s now-infamous, at times unflattering profile of the singer in the New York Times from that time period, in which Hirschberg describes the photoshoot where the picture was taken. “Later its recorded that sea punk was created in NYC in 2011,” M.I.A. writes, offering no further comment on the matter. Find the photo below. \nM.I.A. also refers to Hirschberg as “the wicked witch from NYT ” and “that bitch” in the Instagram caption, taking issue with the writer’s exclusion of the photographer’s background from the profile. It’s a long-standing grudge—the singer tweeted out Hirschberg’s phone number shortly after the piece initially ran in 2010.
