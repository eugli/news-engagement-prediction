Rafiqul Islam Previous Next With all eyes glued to the newly formed Election Commission, the new commissioners say they will do their job unbiasedly and in accordance with the law. \nFrom writers to former army officers to former secretaries to former judges, the new EC is a blend of all of them, plus a woman commissioner for the first time in its history. \nThe EC will be led by former secretary KM Nurul Huda. \nFour others will help him out as commissioners. \nSpeaking to bdnews24.com, one of the commissioners, Mahbub Talukder, said, \"It is a tough responsibility in the constitutional post. We will discharge our duty with honesty, efficiency and in an unbiased manner.\" Rafiqul Islam Mahbub Talukder The award-winning writer, born in Netrokona, was a teacher of the Chittagong University during the Liberation War. He entered the civil service as a deputy secretary at the Bangabhaban in 1972. \nHe has worked with President Abu Sayeed Chowdhury and with the nation's founding father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman himself. \nHis name was a BNP suggestion. \nHis new colleague at the EC, Rofiqul Islam, told bdnews24.com, \"I seek the prayers of my countrymen so that we are able to fulfil their aspirations.\" \nMahbub also vowed to work dispassionately. He was an additional secretary at the EC secretariat in 2008 and served as a secretary to the ministry of science and technology before retiring in 2013. \nFormer army man Shahadat Hossain Chowdhury said he hoped he could fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the people and the political parties. \nHailing from Noakhali, he joined the army 1980 and retired in 2010 as a brigadier general. \nShahadat worked with the EC when ballots with pictures of candidate were introduced.

This is history. I'm very happy being a part of it,\" she said, bubbling with happiness. \nIn her immediate reactions to bdnews24.com, she said, \"I was a judge for 31 years.
