(John Munson/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Wednesday, February 22, 2017, 1:07 AM \nIf you’re planning on seeing Derek Jeter’s number retired, looks like you are going to be dealing with the Mother of all ticket increases. \nThe Yankees website shows ticket prices for the May 14 (Mother’s Day) game against the Astros at 7:30 p.m. ranging from $90 bleacher seats to $500 Field Level seats. \nSetting varied ticket prices for different games is commonly practiced in MLB, but the difference between Derek Jeter Night and an average regular-season Yankee game is quite drastic. \nThe day prior to the ceremony − a 1 p.m. tilt − fans can grab bleacher tickets for as low as $10 and Main Level seats range from $59-$65, compared to the $205-$210 range to see The Captain honored. \nA-Rod already has stronger connection to Yankees than Jeter does \nYankees individual tickets are available to the public starting 10 a.m. Wednesday, via a Mastercard pre-sale. \nThe secondary market for Derek Jeter Night will also likely be expensive. Jeter is the last of the Yankees’ ‘Core Four’ to be honored by the team. \nThe Mother’s Day ceremony will begin at 7:30 p.m. where Jeter will be given a plaque in Monument Park and have his No. 2 retired.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:12:29.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
