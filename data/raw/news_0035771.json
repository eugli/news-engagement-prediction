Philstar.com/Artemio Dumlao \nBAGUIO CITY, Philippines (Philippines News Agency) - President Rodrigo Duterte has dismissed as “pure garbage” the recent allegations against him, saying he has already ordered the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) to make public his net worth. \nIn a speech before the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) Class of 1967 of which he is an honorary member, the chief executive described the issue as a matter of principle and honor for him. \nHe reiterated his campaign pledge that should any of his family members or he himself be involved in corruption in government, he will resign immediately from office. He also gave his word that he would not bring shame to PMA Class of 1967. \n\"Kaya ang gusto ko lang sabihin sa inyo, it’s politics again. It’s a rehash of what they… it is pure garbage,\" the president said in his speech at the Cordillera Convention Hall of the Baguio Country Club Friday night. \n\"But you know, I’m president. I’ve ordered AMLC and everybody to give information what’s my worth in this, in terms of pesos, in this planet.\" \nDuterte further said that neither any member of his family nor himself is involved in corruption, noting that he has not signed any voucher for extra benefits or accepted allowances. He admitted he only gets his salary.

I would not like to be a person (who is) into the blame game,\" he said. \n\"But at least during my time, there will be a respite for the people. And corruption will really be controlled or stopped. ‘Yan ang masiguro ninyo,\" Duterte said.
