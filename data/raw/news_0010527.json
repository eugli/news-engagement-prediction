even though police have ruled out links to terrorism.\nMia, from Derbyshire, was stabbed to death at a hostel in Queensland, Australia last year by Frenchman Smail Ayad.\nTom Jackson, 30, also died after trying to save Mia's life and 29-year-old Ayad has been charged with their alleged murders.\nMia Ayliffe Chung, who was stabbed to death while staying at a hostel in Queensland, Australia (Photo: Facebook) Heartbroken Rosie Ayliffe - Mia's mum - said 'any fool can shout Allahu Akbar as they commit a crime' and blasted Trump for his throwaway comments.\nRead More Donald Trump falsely used killing of Brit backpackers as example of 'terror attack' in blast of media reporting Rosie, 53, said: \"My daughter's death will not be used to further this insane persecution of innocent people.\n\"The circumstances of Mia and Tom's deaths prove that those with the strength of character to travel the world and learn about other cultures should be cherished as brave, resilient characters who have so much to offer if they are nurtured, rather than feated by adverse circumstances as they were.\"\nTrump listed the incident as one of 78 'terror attacks' since 2014 which 'did not receive adequate attention from Western media sources'.\nLes and Sandra Jackson, parents of murdered backpacker Tom Jackson, with Rosie Ayliffe, mother of Mia Ayliffe-Chung (Photo: Andy Stenning/Daily Mirror) As the Mirror online reported, all 78 WERE covered by the media, though not all were branded terror attacks.\nRosie said: \"The possibility of Mia and Tom's deaths being consequent to an Islamic terror attack was discounted in the early stages of the police investigation through international collaboration on the parts of Queensland police department and the French ant-terrorist force. \n\"I have spoken to friends of Mia's and other backpackers who worked for long days in the fields with Ayad, and none of them ever saw him put down a prayer mat.\nTom Jackson (pictured with brother Dan and sister Olivier) died trying to defend fellow backpacker Mia (Photo: Daily Mirror) \"Salat or prayer is the second of five pillars of Islam, and calls for five daily rituals of ablution, prayer and prostration.\n\"An Islamic fundamentalist by definition must respect the five pillars of Islam. \n\"It would be very hard to imagine someone managing to perform this ritual five times a day in the close confines of Home Hill Hostel without witnesses.\" \nShe added: \"I want to discount this myth of a connection between my daughter's death and Islamic fundamentalism.\n\"Any fool can shout Allahu Akbar as they commit a crime.\nMia died last year \"This vilification of whole nation states and their people based on religion is a terrifying reminder of the horror that can ensue when we allow ourselves to be led by ignorant people into darkness and hatred.\"\nMia, from Wirksworth, Derbyshire, died in August 2016 after being stabbed in front of dozens of backpackers at a hostel.\nMia reportedly met Ayad when they were working on a farm near Townsville, Queensland.\nPolice are looking into whether Ayad - who reportedly shouted Allahu Akbah as he attacked her - was obsessed with Mia.\nTom died a hero (Photo: Daily Mirror) Tom, a 30-year-old from Cheshire, tried to save Mia and died from stab wounds six days after the attack.\nRosie is now launching a campaign to protect 'exploited' backpackers working for their visa in Australia.\nRead More Donald Trump says these terror attacks weren't reported in the media - here's proof that they were She is currently running a charity auction to raise money to travel to Australia in spring, which concludes on February 11 in Wirksworth.\nSmail Ayad stabbed two backpackers in Queensland (Photo: Facebook) She said: \"The plan is to go out to Australia in spring to highlight some of the issues around the 88 days of farm work linked to visa applications.\n\"I am campaigning because of the exploitation of backpackers and the fact their safety is often compromised because of a lack of regulation.\n\"The auction concludes with a masquerade ball - it's very Mia.\"\n  Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily   Comments Show more comments More On Tom Jackson Donald Trump Mia Ayliffe-Chung Murder Terrorism Terror attacks Crime Knife crime", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:47:34.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
