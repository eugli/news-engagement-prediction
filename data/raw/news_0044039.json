In the next few weeks will be ready for public to comment on.\" \nSingh said the IFP was pleased that the government and its agencies had sped up the process for access to medical marijuana. \n\"There seems to be a realisation that we cannot be left out as a country with permitting the use of medical marijuana. Other countries are doing that under very strict conditions.\" \nSingh, however, added that the public should not think that marijuana would become fully legal overnight. He said there would be a strict regulatory process before people had access to it. \nHe added that research was required before a bill could be passed to legalise the substance for medical use. \n\"Even now, there is a perception when people see marijuana headlines that it will be legal. Our concern is that we donâ€™t want this to be a free-for-all. Recreational users must not feel they can just go plant this and use it in whatever form they want.\" \n'Earmarked for pain relief' \nSingh said marijuana should be strictly regulated by government, but suggested that it should be available to all South Africans for whom it could be helpful. \n\"The availability should include government hospitals.\" \nSingh went on to say that the public should be responsible in responses to the public comment on the bill. \n\"The public should consider that this substance is not completely illegal. Its uses have been earmarked for pain relief.\" \nThe Department of Health in 2016 committed to opening up processes that could lead to the legalisation of medical marijuana for chronic illnesses. \nThe department and the MCC in 2016 announced that they would request public comment on the Medical Innovation Bill. \nThe Bill was first introduced by former IFP MP Dr Mario Oriani-Ambrosini during his own fight against terminal cancer, before his death in 2014.
