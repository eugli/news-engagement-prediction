But the country’s humanitarian spirit does come with a price. According to a BBC report , Sweden took in more than 162,000 people seeking asylum in 2015. Almost one-third came from Syria. With a population of 9.5 million, the country is also reported to have produced the highest number of Islamic State fighters per capita in Europe. About 140 of the 300 who went to Syria and Iraq have now returned to Sweden. \nData released by Sweden’s crime prevention council document “no significant” spike in crime, according to The New York Times. However, “The council did note an increase in assaults and rapes last year, but it also recorded a drop in thefts and drug offenses.” Advertisement In an essay published in the newspaper Expressen, Benjamin Dousa, whose father was a Turkish immigrant to Sweden, suggested that Trump’s critique was right. “A battered journalist, stones thrown at the police, and stores that are being plundered, unfortunately, are not unusual occurrences where I live,” wrote Dousa, a member of a local board in Rinkeby that distributes money for schools, social services, and elder care. \nCountries like Sweden are taking in the huddled masses we don’t want. Under Trump, this country is also now prepared to send back those who managed to make it here. I hate the anti-immigrant sentiment that fuels Trump’s policies. I admire those countries that look at refugees and see desperate human beings, not hate-filled terrorists. But the influx of people in need of food, shelter, jobs, and a secure future does create problems for the host country. Ignoring that reality gives Trump license to continue his campaign to delegitimize the mainstream news media. “Give the public a break, “ he tweeted. “The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!” \nAs Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Lofven, acknowledged, even as he disputed Trump’s assessment, “We have challenges, no doubt about that.” Decrying every presidential tweet and utterance undercuts the media’s ability to call out Trump for words and actions with truly serious consequences. It also ignores the real social problems that must be addressed when refugees descend upon a country kind and generous enough to embrace them. Joan Vennochi can be reached at .
