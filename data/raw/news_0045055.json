(Chris Walker/Chicago Tribune) Michael Hawthorne posted around two storage terminals on the Calumet River during 2014 and 2015 detected alarming levels of manganese, a heavy metal used in steelmaking that can permanently damage the nervous system and trigger learning difficulties, memory loss and anxiety.\nInvestigators have an educated guess about which company is responsible for the pollution. Yet their efforts to pinpoint the culprit and crack down on its emissions have been thwarted for nearly three years. \nThe chief suspect, S.H. Bell Co., a Pittsburgh-based firm that stockpiles manganese and other materials near the former petcoke sites, has repeatedly ignored city regulations adopted in 2014 that require bulk storage operators to install air pollution monitors around the perimeter of their properties. The company also spurned a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency request for monitoring equipment, prompting the EPA to sue S.H. Bell in federal court last year. \nNow the company, which denies it is responsible for the pollution, is resisting the city's efforts to get the monitors installed before a March 1 deadline S.H. Bell agreed to as part of a legal settlement with federal authorities. (John Byrne) \nThe ongoing dispute highlights the difficulties regulators often face when enforcing public health laws. Environmental lawyers say it will be even tougher to fight polluters if President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress follow through on plans to gut the EPA's enforcement office and dramatically reduce the agency's workforce. \n\"Cases like this show why it's so important to have government agencies looking out for communities when corporations dig in their heels and do everything they can to avoid complying with the law,\" said Mary Gade, who was forced out of the top EPA job in Chicago during President George W. Bush's administration after she forced Dow Chemical to speed up the removal of toxic waste near its Michigan headquarters. \"Without a well-trained, experienced enforcement staff, it's easier for companies to cut corners in ways that can harm people.\" \nAbout 20,000 people, including 1,730 ages 5 and younger, live in low-income, predominantly Latino neighborhoods within a mile of the S.H. Bell facility between 101st and 103rd streets. Parents at Gallistel Language Academy, five blocks away from the storage terminal, said they knew little about the company beyond the dump trucks they see rumbling through its gates. (Michael Hawthorne) \nUnlike the gritty, lung-damaging dust that blew through the neighborhood from petcoke storage facilities, the flakes of manganese that worry federal scientists generally aren't visible. \nResearchers who once assumed the health hazards were limited to steelworkers are increasingly concerned about concentrations detected in the air surrounding facilities that handle manganese. Regular exposure to high levels of the heavy metal can cause manganism, a condition with symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, and make it more difficult for children to learn and remember. \n\"We thought we had won a big victory, getting the petcoke out of here so it is safe for our kids to breathe outside,\" said Veronica Gutierrez, president of the Gallistel PTA. \"This manganese is all really new to us, but we don't like what we're hearing.\" \nInspectors began taking a closer look at S.H. Bell in 2014 after reviewing data from pollution monitors the EPA required around two sites operated by KCBX Terminals, a company owned by the conservative industrialists Charles and David Koch , who are major financial backers of congressional efforts to strip the EPA of its powers. \nSee Chicago Tribune reports, graphics, data visuals and videos on lead poisoning and its effects on children and the city's most vulnerable neighborhoods.

Buried in the agency's report about KCBX was another startling finding: The pollution monitors picked up spikes of manganese on days when winds blew from the vicinity of S.H. Bell across the river. \nA company spokeswoman said there is no proof it is responsible for the pollution and noted that other facilities in the area also handle manganese, which is used to make steel stronger and more rust-resistant. An email response to questions from the Tribune described the element as a \"naturally occurring substance\" and an \"essential nutrient for human health.\" \n\"S.H. Bell believes it has a duty to comply with environmental regulations, and consistently invests in best available technology in order to do so,\" the company email said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:16:20.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
