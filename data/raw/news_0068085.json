Even Mr. Trump, whose White House has insisted relations with Mexico are “phenomenal”, acknowledged he’d sent his top diplomat to Mexico on a “tough trip”. \n“I want to say clearly and most emphatically that the Mexican government and the Mexican people have no reason to accept unilateral decisions imposed by one government on another,” said Mexico’s foreign relations secretary, Luis Videgaray. “We are not going to accept that, because we don’t have to.” \nMr. Videgaray added a cryptic but pointed warning that Mexico wouldn’t hesitate to challenge the U.S. move at the United Nations or other global venues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:25:41.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
