Credit: AP/Handout \nMore than 130,000 people have been told to evacuate over concerns that the emergency spillway on America's tallest dam could fail. \nResidents living in cities near California's Oroville Dam were told to leave their homes as concerned officials warned that the spillway could collapse imminently. \n\"Immediate evacuation from the low levels of Oroville and areas downstream is ordered,\" the Butte County sheriff said in a statement posted on social media. \"This is NOT A Drill.\" \nThe California Department of Water Resources said on Twitter that the spillway next to the dam was \"predicted to fail within the next hour,\" but hours later the situation appeared less dire as the spillway remained standing. \nThe Water Resources department said crews using helicopters would drop rocks to fill a gouge in the spillway. \nAuthorities were also releasing water to lower the lake's level after weeks of heavy rain.
