Fabulous! Don't forget to share with your friends on Twitter and Facebook. Witches Are Casting A Spell On Trump As “An Act Of Magical Resistance” You really can’t make this stuff up. Julia Reinstein BuzzFeed News Reporter 1. Witches around the world will join together at Trump Tower at midnight Friday to cast a spell on President Trump as “an act of magical self-defense.” Facebook: bindtrump The spell is a “binding spell. It’s meant to use your personal energy to restrain Trump’s power without causing any harm, Michael Hughes, a self-identified magician who organized the ritual, told BuzzFeed News. \n“The analogy I use is, it’s not punching a Nazi in the face, it’s tying a Nazi up, taking his bullhorn away, and smashing his phone so he can’t tweet,” Hughes said. \nThe mass ritual will take place at Trump Tower in New York, with smaller rituals happening in Los Angeles, Baltimore, Portugal, South Africa, and many other locations. ID: 10586558 2. The ritual involves burning an “unflattering” photo of Trump on a stumpy orange candle while chanting “You’re fired!” In the absence of an orange candle, a white candle or baby carrot may be substituted. Additional components include the use of the Tower tarot card and a pre-written spell, which includes lines such as: \nBind him so that he shall not break our polity Usurp our liberty Or fill our minds with hate, confusion, fear, or despair And bind, too, All those who enable his wickedness And those whose mouths speak his poisonous lies \n“We’re going to do this every month on the waning crescent moon until he’s out of office,” Hughes said. ID: 10586368 3. “Ceremonial magicians, root workers, and kind of new age-y people” and “even some Christian witches” will be in attendance, Hughes said. View this image › Hughes said he’s received “at least 100 emails” from people all over the country and world saying they plan to participate, both solo and alongside a coven. \n“What’s fascinating to me is that so many people who have never done anything like this are being drawn to do it,” he said. “Like why not? Let’s try anything.” ID: 10586462 4. Hughes said he sees magic as “one tool among many” for resistance. “I call Congress every day, I write letters, I’ve sent postcards, I’ve marched and everything. This is just one other prong in what we can do,” he said. \n“The real power that I see in this, and why I think so many people are embracing it, is because it’s a way of taking back your own power,” he said. “So many of us just feel overwhelmed and beat down by the barrage of assaults on civil liberties, on immigrants, on the environment.” ID: 10587022 5. However, as you might have expected, not everyone’s down to get witchy. A website called “Christian Nationalist Alliance” (which is also openly Anti-Islam, btw) has declared a “day of prayer” to counter the spell. View this image › “While this sort of magical attack on believers and servants of God is nothing new, this instance stands out to me because they are attempting to enlist the aid of non-religious liberals,” the article says. “These people, mostly young, who may be riled up by the non-stop media attacks on President Trump are a fertile recruiting ground for Satanic groups.” \n“This is a declaration of spiritual war and it requires a response,” it says. ID: 10586665 6. It’s unclear how many people plan to counter-pray for Trump (the site appears to have been made in January, and has little over 700 Twitter followers). Even so, some people are taking the counter-prayer efforts VERY seriously.
