O'Keefe celebrates. Image: Twitter \nKohli's total of 13 runs is his lowest in a home Test. India's tally of 212 runs from both innings is also the nation's lowest in a home Test. \nIt is Australia's first Test win in India since 2004, with the result also snapping their nine-Test losing streak in Asia. \nThe 32-year-old O'Keefe's match haul is statistically the greatest performance by a visiting spinner in India, which has been hosting Tests for 84 years. Kohli can't believe it. Image: Twitter \nHowever Kohli made it clear India's failures with the bat were responsible for the shock result - and not O'Keefe's canny left-arm spin. \n\"If you don't apply yourself, any bowling attack can look dangerous,\" Kohli quipped, when asked about O'Keefe's 12-wicket match haul. \n\"It's as simple as that.
