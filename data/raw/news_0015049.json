Donald Trump's executive order on immigration and its immediate consequences explained. \nRula Aoun, director of the Arab American Civil Rights League in Dearborn, Michigan, said her group is advising people to hurry. \n\"We're telling them to get on the quickest flight ASAP,\" said Ms Aoun, whose group filed a lawsuit on Tuesday in federal court in Detroit asking a judge to declare Mr Trump's immigration order unconstitutional. \nMs Aoun said some people had had to make hard choices, including a Yemeni family expected to arrive at John F Kennedy International Airport on Sunday from Egypt without two of their children. \nThe father and two of the children are US citizens, the mother has an immigrant visa, but the other two children did not yet have theirs and were left behind with relatives. \n\"They just don't want to take a chance of waiting,\" she said. \nUS officials have said up to 60,000 foreigners had their visas \"provisionally revoked\" to comply with Mr Trump's order.
