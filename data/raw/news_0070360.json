Samsung is expected to release its latest smartphone Galaxy S8 very soon, but the specifications sheet for the Galaxy S8+ has already been leaked by the famous leaker Evan Blass on his Twitter account. The tech giant might unveil the official date for the launch of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ smartphone at the Mobile World Congress 2017. Meanwhile, before the official announcement, Evan Blass has tweeted the spec sheet of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. According to the picture posted by Blass, the Galaxy S8+ device will reportedly carry a 6.2-inch Quad HD+ Super AMOLED ‘full rectangle’ display, or 6.1-inch when factoring in the rounded corners.\nThe Galaxy S8+ smartphone will reportedly get 4GB RAM and 64GB of internal memory and can be expanded using a microSD card. Interestingly, there is no information on the processor which will come in the Galaxy S8+. While Samsung has been stocking the initial supply of Snapdragon 835 processor, it is not clear if the company will use it in this smartphone. The leak by Blass also does not reveal anything about the AI voice-powered assistant Bixby. Amid all the negative hype Samsung recently found itself in, it does not appear to let it come in between developing some great new technology. It is hoping to make a grand comeback.\nSamsung Galaxy S8+ spec sheet.
