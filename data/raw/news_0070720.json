Team President Larry Bird and General Manager Kevin Pritchard could add depth in the frontcourt or on the perimeter. \nDon't expect a blockbuster. Multiple sources told IndyStar the Pacers would not consider any trade discussion that involved Paul George. \nThe Pacers also do not plan to move Jeff Teague, their starting point guard, or Myles Turner, their 20-year-old phenom center. The Pacers want to see how this trio can build chemistry over time, and Bird wants to re-sign Teague, who is playing on an expiring contract, to a long-term deal this summer. \nWith those players off the market, the Pacers’ best asset is their first-round pick in June’s draft. Bird is willing to trade the pick if it allows him to add another veteran who could help the Pacers in the playoffs. \n“If we can do something, we’ll do it,” Bird said last month. He added: “We do have our draft pick. We’ve been a team that if we can get the right guy, we would entertain maybe moving our pick. Other teams like that.” \nIn his midseason interview with IndyStar last month, Bird said he was not in a rush to make a move at the deadline and was more worried about how the Pacers would develop after the midway point of the season. Bird’s position has changed for two reasons. The Pacers entered the All-Star break last week on a six-game losing streak, their longest of the season. The other reason is the growing concern that George could leave the Pacers after next season when he can opt to become an unrestricted free agent. \nAlthough George said Friday on ESPN radio that he wants to lead the Pacers to their first NBA championship, he also has made it clear he wants to see the supporting players that Bird surrounds him with before making a decision. \n“As I told Larry, I always want to play on a winning team,” George said on the program. He later added: “Man, I want a chance to play for a chance to win a championship.” \nAs far as acquiring talent, the Pacers have reached out to multiple teams to gauge who is available. \nESPN reported Tuesday that the Pacers have engaged in talks with the Philadelphia 76ers to acquire second-year center Jahlil Okafor. It is unclear whether the Pacers could complete the move with the 76ers using just their first-round pick. In 38 games this season, Okafor has averaged 11.4 points and 4.8 rebounds. If Okafor became a Pacer, he would likely contribute off the bench. \nThe Pacers have also had discussions with the Brooklyn Nets to see what it would take to acquire center Brook Lopez or Bojan Bogdanovic, according to media reports, although the likelihood of such a deal appears to be slim. Other veterans who are on the market include Phoenix’s P.J. Tucker and New Orleans’ Terrence Jones. \nOpposing team executives have expressed interest in acquiring third-year wing Glenn Robinson III and veteran guard Rodney Stuckey, according to league sources. Robinson, who is one of the younger Pacers at 23, has intrigued teams with his athleticism and improvement this season. In 55 games this season, Robinson has averaged 6.2 points and 3.7 rebounds. He is also shooting 38.4 percent on 3s. \nOthers teams have mentioned Stuckey for his value as a reliable guard off the bench. Aaron Brooks, who has not played in six of the Pacers’ past seven games, could also be included in a trade since he is playing under an expiring contract worth $2.7 million. \nWhether the Pacers can make a trade by just exchanging their first-round pick remains unclear. With a full 15-man roster, the Pacers will likely need to include at least one player in a trade to fulfill the NBA’s roster requirements. \nAfter weeks of listening to offers, the Pacers’ front office has been more aggressive about seeing how it can improve the roster. As one source said Tuesday, if the Pacers are unable to reach a deal by Thursday’s deadline, it won’t be because they didn’t try. \nCall IndyStar reporter Nate Taylor at (317) 444-6484.
