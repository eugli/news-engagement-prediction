The survey added that 79 percent of Clinton voters plan to watch this year’s ceremony in comparison with 66 percent of Trump voters.\nThe 89th Academy Awards airs Sunday, Feb. 26 on ABC with Jimmy Kimmel scheduled to host.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:05:35.542+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
