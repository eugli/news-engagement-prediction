Plagued by depression, the women lie in the pits as they contemplate life and death on the path to regaining their strength, according to the China Youth Daily.\nLiu Taijie, the group’s founder, said that after her divorce she lost hope and attempted suicide but managed to pull herself together by changing her perspective on life and death.\n“I was abandoned by my husband. I was despised by my family. I was deceived by a pyramid selling scam. I wanted to die,” she said in a video published by People’s Daily.\n\nA scene from a ‘People’s Daily’ video about the women.

Her programme aims to allow divorcees to confront death head-on and remind them that there are plenty of opportunities left in the world to accomplish.\n“Tears are useless. Death cannot solve problems. I want to change, and use that experience to help other women,” she said. And, once she got over her past, she shed more than 30kg in weight and now runs a successful business.\nLiu will hold the “grave classroom” once every two months and is free of charge for whoever needs it.\n“Failure is not scary,” she said. “I hope all divorced women can lead new lives and accomplish their own goals. Women must rely on themselves and be their own queens.” – South China Morning Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T08:55:21.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
