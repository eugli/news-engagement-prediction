No matter how you get your glow on, it's safe to say the fresh-faced, dewy look isn't going anywhere anytime soon—especially if recent runway looks are any indication. Which is why we love when beauty brands make getting glow-y easy by packing their products with luminescent, light-reflecting ingredients. (Case in point: the shimmery and hydrating Erborian Glow Creme .) It basically takes the guesswork out of finding the perfect highlighter in a world filled with what seems like hundreds of purple , liquid , and powder versions. And although GlamGlow launched its own two-in-one moisturizer-highlighter hybrid last year (which we're still obsessed with), the skin-care brand just dropped two new shades of the slightly shimmery cream today. While the GlamGlow GlowStarter Mega Illuminating Moisturizer isn't a completely new launch from the (relatively new) Estée Lauder Companies–owned brand, the hydrating cream—made with hyaluronic acid to moisturize and plump skin and jojoba oils to nourish—is a product that GlamGlow's had on offer since last summer. Unlike typical moisturizers, though, GlamGlow's is flecked with pearlescent particles to create a slight sheen in the pinkish-beige Nude Glow, making it just as much of an illuminator than moisturizer proper. Today, GlamGlow added two new shades to the Illuminating Moisturizer range: Pearl Glow, a lily-white hue best for fair skin tones, and the golden-toned, appropriately named Sun Glow, best for darker complexions.
