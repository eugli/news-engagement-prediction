As Harris fell to the ground, he let out a scream. Before long, it was determined he needed to leave the arena on a stretcher. Here is the play. It is not graphic, but you can hear Harris’ pained howls. hdsportsclips: Eron Harris screaming in pain ESPN College Basketball: Michigan State at Pur… https://t.co/tFAl04J0bN pic.twitter.com/VfrVvx3E8K — FanSportsClips (@FanSportsClips) February 18, 2017 \nAfter the game, MSU coach Tom Izzo said Harris “badly” sprained his knee . He will travel home with the team. \nHarris wasn’t playing far from his hometown; he grew up in Indianapolis. Entering Saturday’s game, Harris was averaging 11.1 points and 3.0 rebounds. As he was being secured by medical staff to the gurney, cameras caught MSU freshman Miles Bridges in tears, and his teammates all came over to wish him off. \nThe incident came with 9:18 remaining in the second half. Purdue’s official men’s basketball Twitter account sent out this message shortly thereafter. Hang in there, Eron... You've repped the state of Indiana well. Best wishes. — Purdue Basketball (@BoilerBall) February 18, 2017 \nMichigan State (16-11, 8-6), which finds itself in the unusual position of being a bubble team, has been beset by injuries since the fall. It began when the team lost two projected starters in the frontcourt -- Ben Carter and Gavin Schilling -- who have not played for Sparty this season. Harris going down makes for three seniors who are unavailable. Tom Izzo: \"Saddest part for Eron (Harris), No. 1 he’s a senior. Also he’s the one who spends the most time in gym, watches the most film.\" — Gregg Doyel (@GreggDoyelStar) February 18, 2017 \nSince Harris is a senior, if the injury is season-ending, his college career would be over. \nMSU’s next game is Thursday vs. Nebraska. Purdue is now 22-5 overall, with an 11-3 record in the Big Ten. The Boilermakers are tied for first place in the league.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:27:46.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
