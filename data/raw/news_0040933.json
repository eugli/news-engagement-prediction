'I have even taken bookings for Halloween 2018 - which is amazing. 'I know I will still be doing this then, because I love what I do, but I can't believe people have planned that far ahead - it is absolutely crazy. 'Halloween is definitely my busiest day of the year - the rest of the time it is mainly just make-up for photo-shoots, no-one wants to look like a lion or a zombie the rest of the year.' Beneath the layers of dramatic make-up, Belinda looks like any other fresh-faced 24-year-old The 24-year-old trained as a year as a make-up artist in Gateshead, before going freelance and moving into the niche of face-panting. 'I don't know what I would really call my work - when people think of face painting they always immediately think of kids rather than adults. 'I started out by posting the pictures on my Instagram, but I was worried in case my friends thought I was posting too much and spamming them, so I set up a different one and got loads of followers. A white tiger formed the basis of this transformation - and Belinda added a fleece robe for a final flourish Feline fine: Belinda's hair provided the 'mane' for this lion-inspired transformation The mother-of-one says Halloween has become her busiest time of year for bookings 'People are always shocked when I show them my art, but that's what I go for - I like it to be shocking and to make a statement because that means people will remember it. 'I just can't believe that I am doing this for a living - I still think of it as my weird little hobby.' The talented mother-of-one creates the memorising images using her own brand of face paint - called Beauty by Belinda - which is vegan and animal cruelty free, which will is launching online this weekend. The 24-year-old has a son, eight-month-old Alfie, with her boyfriend Robert Chatterton Share or comment on this article 219 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T19:25:30.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
