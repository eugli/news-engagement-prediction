They're usually fairly compact, with a mix of blue and red slopes, but you’ll also find the occasional black. Is there any off piste? \nWhile you’re unlikely to experience fresh powder in the summer, catch it right and conditions can be smooth and flattering, thanks to the melting and freezing of old snow when the weather gets warmer. What about terrain parks? \nAny glacier area worth its salt puts a lot of work into its terrain park, making up for a more limited ski area with enough kickers, rails, pipes and boarder/skicross tracks for all levels to while away several hours – and enabling you to perfect tricks in soft conditions. The parks often attract pros for training sessions, making great viewing. Can I stay out on the slopes all day? \nSome glacier areas have similar opening hours in summer to winter, but many gear them around optimum conditions – which can mean opening as early as 7am and closing at 2pm. Whistler has 1,500km of mountain bike trails and 250km of lift-served cross-country trails Credit: Robin O'Neill Do ski schools operate in summer? \nDefinitely – glaciers are great places to hone skills on summer ski courses [link], most hosting ski racers and freestylers during the summer. Check out resort websites for links to schools, and to the many specialised camps that run during the summer Are lift passes the same price as in winter? \nResorts offer similar types of passes to the ones available in winter, but at cheaper rates in recognition of the more limited areas. You're more likely to find passes for non-consecutive days so that you can pick and choose when to hit the slopes. Many work in tandem with a separate visitor pass that gives access to a whole range of summer activities. What is there to do after the slopes close? \nYou could just relax and breathe in the fresh mountain air… But you’d miss out on activities from the more usual hiking, biking, golfing and swimming, to the wild and weird, from sliding down a ramp into an Alpine lake through aerial trekking to bear watching. As many activities are free with a ski or visitor pass, it’d be rude not to. Where to go \nOpen June 25 to August 7, 7.15am to 1.00pm Ski pass One day €37 \nA funicular train from Tignes ' Val Claret area accesses 20km of slopes for all standards on the Grande Motte, including a terrain park, all served by 12 lifts including a cable car up to the high point of 3,456m.
