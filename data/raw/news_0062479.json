Up to 72 hours after the use of a Fit Tea Wrap, our natural extracts continue penetrating skin to provide toning, firming, and cellulite-minimising benefits.” A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Feb 20, 2017 at 1:16pm PST \nBut Sydney doctor Sam Hay, who has appeared on Embarrassing Bodies Down Under , says Fit Tea Wraps are unlikely to have any effect on the body, whatsoever. \n“I am flabbergasted that people are stupid enough to believe in this,” Dr Hay told news.com.au. \n“Fat and cellulite have a very low blood supply, so very little of those ingredients are going to be absorbed through the skin, and even less of it is going to be absorbed into the fat. \n“There’s just no science behind it whatsoever. People are being hoodwinked.” Fit Tea Wraps claim to reduce weight and cellulite. Source: Supplied \nHe said it was irresponsible of Jenner, who has 86 million Instagram followers, to promote a product that doesn’t work. \n“She’s not a health professional but she still has a responsibility to promote something that has an effect. I would argue this has zero effects,” Dr Hay said. \nThe best way to lose weight and reduce cellulite is through regular exercise, specifically movements that target muscle strength. \n“I’m a big believer in a balanced lifestyle. Weight control is about eating less energy and burning off more, simple as that. Eat less food and do more exercise,” he said. \nNews.com.au has contacted Fit Tea Wraps for comment. \nSeen a beauty product or trend you want to know more about?
