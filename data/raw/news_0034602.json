New Delhi | Updated: February 14, 2017 10:25 am If being in love means doing such stupid things “in love”, then singleton is a better place to be! \n“Why shouldn’t I be cranky? 23 years of my life, and I haven’t found anyone perfect for me,” I overheard my classmate saying these words to her bestie. Haven’t we all heard that line from someone we know? It’s February 14, and Valentine’s Day whisks lovers into quiet corners and secret spots, leaving single men and women cringing with that thought. \nALSO READ | Serial daters or serial singles? Ae Dil Hai Mushkil! \nCouples hatch out a plan for Valentine’s Day well in advance, but singles continue to live the same, old, boring and dull life. Forgetful of the fact that it’s V-Day, they land in colleges and offices only to flinch at the startling revelation. And the minute they see a couple or anyone who’s excited/prepared for the day, a cloud of despair looms over their head giving a bitter warning: “You’re single and you’ll always be single… so hate everyone who’s not!” \nALSO READ | Valentine’s Day special: Is India finally ready for speed dating… and changing concepts of young love? \nIf the twosome seems to any less bothersome, heart-shaped hunks and chunks exasperate and enrage them. From heart key chains, heart earrings, heart-shaped photo frames, heart art pieces, heart bows, heart-shaped parcels and heart-shaped candies — markets are flooded with V-Day gifts twinkling in shades of red and pink. Looking at all the fancy items, their loud, thumping heart yells: For god’s sake, the real heart isn’t even shaped like that!” \nWATCH: What do people think of Valentine’s Week \nSoon, they find themselves stifling in the denial-mode. “Stay single” becomes their mantra! If being in love means doing such stupid things “in love”, then singleton is a better place to be! Don’t you think so? Negativity creeps in the minds of singles during V-Day celebrations with a never-ending despair and they tend to totally despise the concept of “love or dating”. \nDoes that ring a bell? If that seems to be your life story, read these fun life hacks, roll with laughter and try some of them this Valentine’s Day. \nCall the shots for a Single-Squad \nTrack down all your single mates and call them for a house party on Valentine’s Day.

Go for a guilt-free spree \nRelishing your favourite candies, getting a spa treatment or enjoying a warm lavender bath — do what makes you feel good! Ditch the roses, go for sweet treats \nIf you can already smell the roses you won’t get, go and buy your favourite chocolates and treat yourself! No sharing, no caring \nInstead of being somber about being solo, think of all the gifts you don’t have to buy and the words you don’t have to fake. Most of all, think of the chocolates of your elder sister or friends that will come your way after the V-Day frenzy is over. Fall in love with free pizza offers \nThis year, get into a relationship with pizza. What’s more, you’re going to get one free during the Valentine’s week special offers.
