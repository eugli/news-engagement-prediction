Human Rights Watch, which shared a Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for being part of an international anti-landmine campaign, works in 90 nations and has official offices in 24 of them. On Feb. 20, the group received a notice that its application for a work visa for its investigator, Omar Shakir, had been turned down because, a letter said, the group had a pro-Palestinian bias. “Human Rights Watch is systematically biased against Israel,” said Emmanuel Nahshon, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry. “They are in fact in the service of Palestinian propaganda rather than being in the service of the truth and human rights.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Nahshon said that Human Rights Watch would continue to be able to work in Israel. “We will not end our contacts with them,” he said. Ms. Bashi said that Mr. Shakir, an American citizen, had been unable to get into Israel. The group, she said, relies on foreigners because most Israelis, like her, are not permitted into Palestinian areas, including the enclave of Gaza.

Credit Human Rights Watch, via Associated Press Calling the charge of pro-Palestinian bias “outrageous,” Ms. Bashi pointed to several recent reports criticizing the leadership of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. “If we are engaging in Palestinian propaganda, we are doing a lousy job,” she said. The only other countries that have denied such access, she said, were Cuba, North Korea, Sudan, Uzbekistan and Venezuela. Rights groups have complained that the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been increasingly hostile, with groups like B’Tselem and Peace Now, which monitor Israeli settlements and the conditions of Palestinians, coming under particular criticism.
