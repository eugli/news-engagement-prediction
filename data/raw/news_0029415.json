Herdsmen with their cattle \nHe noted further that although the issue was reported to Oyo State Government and the state Police Command, they were yet to meet with them (herdsmen) to discuss ways and means of preventing further occurrence and forestall crisis. \nMeanwhile, the state Commisioner of Police, Sam Adegbuyi, has set up a monitoring committee comprising representatives of the farmers and the herdsmen in the area to unravel the mystery behind the missing 500 cows. \nTheir complaints coincided with the alarm raised by another Fulani group in Iseyin town, alleging that 25 cattle were killed. \nA peace meeting was summoned by Adegbuyi between the herdsmen and farmers at the command headquarters, Eleiyele, where he directed the Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, CIID, to commence investigation into the incident.
