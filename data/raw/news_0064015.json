Shares \nFollowing last year's System Rift—which Andy described as \"a decent, but not essential, two-hour expansion that’s ultimately more of the same\"—Deus Ex: Mankind Divided now has its second slice of story DLC, named A Criminal Past. As you might expect, it's got a launch trailer. \nLook, see: \nAs we reported last month , and as you might've gleaned from the above, A Criminal Past tracks brooding protagonist Adam Jensen's first mission for the anti-terrorist intelligence Task Force 29. He's embedded himself as a convicted criminal within a high-security augs-only prison, and as if that doesn't sound dangerous enough, he's tasked with retrieving sensitive information from a fellow undercover operator who's gone dark. \n\"Success will help the fight against terror around the world,\" so says publisher Square Enix, \"but Jensen will need to confront a darker side to his role before the day is done.\" Classic Jensen, then. \nFancy any of that? If so, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided's A Criminal Past DLC is out now for £9.49/$11.99. If you're already in possession of the game's Digital Deluxe edition or Season Pass then you'll have access to the latest DLC at no extra cost. \nSome online stores give us a small cut if you buy something through one of our links.
