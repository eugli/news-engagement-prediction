Washington (CNN) For those of you keeping track, it's now three days in a row without any executive actions by President Donald Trump, but, of course, stay tuned for updates! As more of the President's cabinet picks push through to a Senate floor vote and the President himself touts some tough long-distance phone calls, much of the buzz on Capitol Hill still centers on what's happening with his immigration orders and which \"R\" word has the most juice when it comes to Obamacare: repeal, replace, or ... drumroll ... repair? ACTION PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK TODAY... EXECUTIVE ACTIONS -- As we said, all was quiet on that front today. WHAT ELSE IS NEW ON DAY 14... Read More OBAMACARE Repair, repeal, replace? On Groundhog Day, Republicans once again find themselves in a war of words, this time over how to describe their health care efforts. Meanwhile, is the repeal plan shrinking ? Former Lousiana Gov.

Fallout from Trump's travel ban continues, as more than 1,000 bodegas in New York City -- largely owned and operated by Yemeni-Americans -- went on strike Thursday. DREAMers can go to college, but they can't get student loans . Trump's ban is impacting students at the Abaarso boarding school in Somaliland, which is known for sending its students to elite universities in the US. Also, American basketball players are stuck in Dubai. The Miami Herald reports on how the fight against sanctuary cities is taking hold in the Florida state legislature and one of their reporters tweeted about developments on the Miami front this afternoon. TRADE After a meeting with the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committee leaders, Trump called NAFTA a \"catastrophe\" and said he wanted to \"speed up\" talks for a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada. Meantime, Mexico is prepared to begin renegotiating NAFTA in May, after a 90-day period during which Pe単a Nieto will consult with Mexican businesses.

Orrin Hatch's playbook, and suspended his committee rules to vote EPA administrator nominee Scott Pruitt out of committee and to the Senate floor. Rep. Jason Chaffetz is withdrawing his bill that proposed to sell off 3.3 million acres of public land in 10 western states.

INFRASTRUCTURE -- The right-leaning American Action Forum put out a report raising questions about the \"practicality of a private sector funded infrastructure,\" and noting that urban areas are most likely to benefit from the draft plans that have circulated.
