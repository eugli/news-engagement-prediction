Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is in Mexico on what Trump called a \"tough trip.\" \nParticipants included CEOs from General Electric Co ( GE.N ), Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ), Dow Chemical Co ( DOW.N ), International Paper Co ( IP.N ), Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), United Technologies and Dell Technologies Inc ( DVMT.N ), Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), Corning Inc ( GLW.N ), Whirlpool, Emerson, Campbell Soup Company, Merck & Co Inc ( MRK.N ), Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), 3M Co ( MMM.N ), U.S. Steel Corp ( X.N ), Archer Daniels Midland Corp ( ADM.N ) and General Dynamics Corp ( GD.N ). \nTrump is expected to roll out a series of proposals that could have big ramifications for companies, including a plan to overhaul the tax code that he has promised within weeks and an infrastructure package that was part of his 2016 presidential campaign promises. \nA former CEO himself in his first public office, Trump has convened a series of such meetings with business leaders from several industries, including pharmaceutical, automotive and aviation makers. \nTrump met last week with a group of CEOs from large retail companies, all of whom oppose a House Republican-backed plan to create a border adjustment tax as part of a tax code overhaul. Several of the CEOs who met Trump on Thursday are part of a coalition that supports the border adjustment tax, which would impose a 20 percent tax on goods that are imported into the country while providing write-offs for goods that are exported. \nOn Thursday, the chief executives each attended one of four breakout sessions with Trump administration economic officials to discuss a variety of topics including conflict minerals regulations, lack of qualified workers, export regulations for defense products, vocational training and business taxes. \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Wednesday, \"The president will meet with a group of world-class business leaders to discuss specific action he can take to remove barriers to job creation.\" \nVice President Mike Pence, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and economic aides met with the CEOs. \n(Reporting by David Shepardson and Ginger Gibson; Editing by Howard Goller) Next In Politics Florida man accused of Clinton Foundation hack to plead guilty \nNEW YORK A Florida man accused of trying to hack the Clinton Foundation in 2015 is expected to plead guilty on Thursday, months after he was sentenced in a related case to 42 years in prison over child pornography discovered on his computers during the probe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:04:35.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
