DOMINICO ZAPATA/FAIRFAX NZ \nEight-year-old girls get ready for their swim. \nThousands turned out to the triathlon on Sunday, including Olympians Mahe Drysdale and Nikki Hamblin and netball star Irene Van Dyk. \nAround 2500 children competed in the Hamilton leg of the event at the University of Waikato. \nOne of those competing was seven-year-old Caleb de Bruin. DOMINICO ZAPATA/FAIRFAX NZ \nSeven-year-old girls gear up for the 50-metre swim. \n\"My favourite is the bike. I like cycling,\" he said. \nIn the weeks leading up to the event, Caleb had been training by biking alongside his mum, netballer Leana de Bruin, while she ran. \nVan Dyk spotted Caleb before the start of his race, gave him a cuddle and wished him well. \nShe said she would have a medal waiting for him at the finish line. Ad Feedback \n\"I can't wait for that,\" Caleb said. \nHundreds of parents lined the rail barriers, peering out from under their umbrellas and hooded raincoats to catch a glimpse of their kids. \nOne of those parents was Keri Maui, whose seven-year-old daughter, Molly Sinclair, was about to take the plunge into her first triathlon. \n\"She's lining up to do her swim,\" Maui said. \nMolly's koro, Tony Shadrock, was the one who did the hard yards, though, taking Molly and her nine-year-old sister, Maea, on training rides, cycling up to 13km at a time. \n\"It's all for them - much better than watching the rugby,\" Shadrock said. \nDrysdale was one of the rock-star athletes waiting at the finish with medals. \n\"I would encourage all kids to take part in the event. It's about getting active and getting involved,\" the rower said. \nDrysdale was \"taking some time off\", but had lined up a few rowing events in the lead-up to the Summer 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. \nChiefs mid-fielder Charlie Ngatai and BMX champion Sarah Walker were also on hand to give out medals. \nThis year's series marks the 25th anniversary of the Weet-Bix Tryathlons, with entries across New Zealand up 10 percent on last year. \nThe very first event, in 1992, saw just 800 entrants, while numbers for the 2015/16 Tryathlon series topped 28,000. - Stuff ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T08:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:44:54.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
