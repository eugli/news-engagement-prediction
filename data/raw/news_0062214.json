The multinational can just walk all over communities.\" \nVictorian Taxi and Hire Car Families also does not support the $2 levy, believing the cost should be borne by Government. \n\"If the Government can pay a billion dollars for a road that wasn't built â€¦ [then they can] give us back our money,\" Ms Spanos said. \nOther ride-booking companies do not plan to pass on levy cost to customers. \nPublic Transport Minister Jacinta Allan said the changes to the industry were about increasing competition. \n\"Uber are currently operating in Victoria as an unregulated provider and have no competitors,\" she said. \n\"Uber are clearly running a campaign that is designed to suit their purposes. \n\"If Uber are telling their customers that they plan to charge them $2 for every fare well that's their choice, other providers have indicated that they will do differently.\" \nThe new levy, which is expected to raise $44 million annually, will be introduced from 2018. \nThe ABC has contacted Uber for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:58:18.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
