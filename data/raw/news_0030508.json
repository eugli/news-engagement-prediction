Since he came to power in 2014, president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has slowly tightened his grip on freedom of expression, choking his critics. \nEditors of national newspapers now face life sentences for working “against the state”. People have been arrested for Facebook posts criticising the government and last week over 4,400 public servants were sacked in an act branded by critics as a witchhunt targeting the political opposition . \nMeanwhile Erdoğan has maintained cordial diplomatic relations with global leaders including Donald Trump, Theresa May and Vladimir Putin , and hopes to extend his constitutional powers with a referendum on 16 April. \nIf you live in Turkey we want to hear how the climate is affecting you. \nHas the crackdown on expression affected your daily life? When did you notice that free speech was being compromised? Have you adjusted what you say and do online? And what advice would you give to other people around the world living under a similar style of leader? \nFill in your details in the form below and we’ll use some of your submissions in our coverage of freedom of speech in Turkey.
