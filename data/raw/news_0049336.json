Murray is up for reelection this fall. \nMurray is the latest Washington politician to go national. Attorney General Bob Ferguson successfully sued to block the President's travel crackdown order. Ferguson is low key, and has shared the stage with state Soliciter General Noah Purcell. \nIn the meantime, however, cable TV viewers across the country have gotten a dose of the hyperbole of Gov. Jay Inslee -- who once said he would build a wall around Washington to keep out Donald Trump.. \nMurray is seizing on detention of a 23-year-old who came to Seattle as a child, who had been covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. That young manwas detained earlier in February by immigration officials looking for his father. \nDaniel Ramirez Medina has no criminal record, but investigators have alleged -- without offering any compelling evidence -- gang ties. \n\"The city must be able to provide accurate information to immigrants and refugees and their families living in Seattle,\" Murray will say. \"We will seek to determine the administration's definition of 'sanctuary cities' and the enforcement actions the federal government may take against us. \n\"We will also seek detailed information about the administration's changes to travel policy as well as changes to immigration status, including the DACA program.\" \nMurray is scheduled to begin his speech at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday at the Idris Mosque in North Seattle. \nHizzoner promised Sunday that it would be edgy.
