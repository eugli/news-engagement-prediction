In light of this, Kerala government also became the first state in the country to be putting up a public domain registry which has a list of sex offenders. Image Source : Sanmeera.com \nSurprisingly, the assaulted actress resumed her work by returning back to the sets of her upcoming film 'Adam' which is under shoot. Praising this move by the actress saying it's an act of courage and excellent work ethics, popular actor Prithviraj Sukumaran took it to Facebook about it. He speaks about how he encouraged such scripts previously and apologised for it. He pledges that he will never disrespect women in his life, through his movies. \nHere is what he said: \n\" Some of the most poignant moments in my life have been punctuated with moments of incredible courage. Courage from what I have now fully realised are God's most benevolent yet intricate creations. WOMEN! \nFrom a mother picking up pieces of a suddenly derailed life, to bring up two young boys to be the men they are today..to a wife who at the fag end of a 40 hour labour, just as she was being cut open without an anaesthetic, holding my hand and telling me \"It's alright Prithvi\"..I have repeatedly been dumbfounded in realising how much of a lesser being I am in the company of the women in my life. \nAnd today..as my dear friend walks in to the sets to kick start the shooting of her new film \"ADAM\", I once again bear witness to an extraordinary moment of courage from an extraordinary woman in my life! Today..she makes a statement..a statement that will echo through time, space and gender..that no one or no incident has control over your life but YOU! A statement that will now be part of counselling sessions and pep talks around the world. A statement that you my friend..are making in a million unheard voices! \nAnd to those voices I apologise..for at an age and time when I wasn't wise enough..I have been part of films that celebrated misogyny..I have mouthed lines that vilified regard for your self respect and I have taken a bow to the claps that ensued. NEVER AGAIN..never again will I let disrespect for women be celebrated in my movies! Yes..I'm an actor and this is my craft! I will whole heartedly trudge the grey and black with characters that possess unhinged moral compasses...but I will never let these men be glorified or their actions justified on screen. \nOnce again..ladies and gentlemen..stand up and applaud for her! Behind the gutsy spunk, there is a vulnerable celebrity who knew well enough what this decision of hers would mean to a life under constant scrutiny. But she also knew..that she had to see it through...for that would set an example..light a torch that will show a path for many to follow!Today she makes a statement.. A statement of extraordinary courage! \nFanboy for life...dear friend..fanboy for life! \nLove always, \nPrithvi. \" \nPrithviraj is one of the first few celebrities who reached out in support of the actress Bhavana. This is a welcome move by the actor and there is going to be a massive societal change if other actors and directors follow it. \nThe prime accused from the molestation incident, Pulsar Sunil, was arrested by Kochi police in Kochi recently and the others were also taken into custody. They shall be charged under Sections 366 (kidnapping), 376 (rape) of IPC and Section 66 of the IT Act. \nDo you have an interesting story to share? Please write to us at .
