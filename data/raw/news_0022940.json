But, as CEO Tim Cook has illustrated frequently in the past, there are ways to drop hints and talk around the concrete facts. \nMuch like how Cook gave rough outlines in interviews of Apple’s interest in the TV space, the executive is now doing the same for augmented reality. And if past comments from Cook are any indication, a product unveiling could be around the corner. The latest comments, from an interview the Apple chief gave to The Independent , indicate that Cook sees AR as a fundamental, revolutionary technology similar to the smartphone.\nI regard it as a big idea, like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining.\nCook goes on to say that he views AR like the silicon used in the iPhone’s chips, in other words as a “core technology” and “not a product per se.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:28:37.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
