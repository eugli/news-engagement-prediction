Crews were able to stop the breach on the river levee by 8:45 p.m. Monday, but the evacuation order remained in place, according to the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services. The breach was found on the eastern side of the San Joaquin River, south of Manteca. The evacuation order was issued around 7:30 p.m., affecting areas mostly of farms and ranches. Crews have since made \"impressive progress on filling in the levee gap\" but have retained the evacuation order to determine when it's \"completely safe to return to the area,\" according to an update on the Manteca Fire Chief's Foundation Facebook page . Heavy rains pounded parts of Northern and central California through Monday, putting more than 14 million people under a flood warning or flash-flood watch. Read More Storms are expected to last into Tuesday, according to CNN meteorologists. Heavy precipitation results as a condensed column of moisture moves inland, causing water vapor to sweep over the mountains, cool and form \" atmospheric rivers ,\" meteorologists say.
