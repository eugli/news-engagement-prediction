I am of short stature and only stand at 3.5ft despite being 22 years old. 'This morning was a repeat of what has happened to me on many occasions. I rushed to catch the 7:07 train from Edinburgh Waverley to Milngavie. I arrived on the platform at 7:04 and the train doors were shut, I could not reach to open them. Paige wrote to ScotRail: 'I am part of a charity for people with dwarfism and I have heard of this happening to others. Can you please take note and consider my comments' Paige, pictured here with Gaz Beadle of Geordie Shore fame, said she's missed trains on numerous occasions due to the height of the buttons 'I looked around to see if there were any staff or passengers that could help me open the doors, which there wasn't. 'Thankfully at 7:06 the signalman came onto the platform to whistle for the train to leave and I got on just before it departed. 'There has been occasions when I have been on time for a train and missed it because the trains doors are not open or do not open on arrival at a station and nobody has been there to help me. 'I am part of a charity for people with dwarfism and I have heard of this happening to others. Can you please take note and consider my comments.' Posting publicly on her own Facebook page, she added: 'ScotRail please leave your doors open on the platform.' Paige, pictured right with a friend, has asked ScotRail to lower the height of the buttons SCOTRAIL RESPONSE & THE LAW A ScotRail spokesman said: 'Door buttons on trains are required by law to be at a set height. We aim for all customers to be able to access our services. We would ask that Paige contacts our assisted travel team to discuss the best ways to ensure she can always travel when she wants.' Commission regulation (EU) No 1300/2014 sets the 'technical specifications for interoperability relating to accessibility of the Union's rail system for persons with disabilities and persons with reduced mobility'. It states that exterior opening controls on train doors shall be not less than 800 mm and not more than 1200 mm measured vertically above platforms, for all platforms for which the train is designed. Scotrail have been criticised for the accessibility of their trains on several occasions previously. In December, mum Deborah Widley slammed the operator after her family was shunted into storage because daughter Murrin, who suffers from spina bifida, is wheelchair-bound. Murrin, 16, was locked in a container meant for suitcases and bikes, and mum Deborah said it made her feel 'like cattle'. In November, the Scottish Trades Union Congress criticised the organisation's proposal to introduce driverless trains, as they said it would increase the dangers and disadvantage faced by disabled and vulnerable passengers. Back in 2013, the organisation was forced to apologise to blind ski racer John Dickinson-Lilley after they denied a reservation because he did not give the required two days' notice.
