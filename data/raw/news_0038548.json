Share Save \nCanon is adding two new members to its EOS DSLR lineup, the 77D and Rebel T7i. The former is designed to be a step above the Rebel series but below the 80D , which was introduced nearly a year ago. It features a 24.2-megapixel (APS-C) CMOS sensor with a Digic 7 processor , 6fps continuos shooting, max ISO of 25,600 and a 45-point autofocus system. There's also NFC and WiFi connectivity for controlling the camera remotely, while video-recording is limited to 1080p at up to 60fps. \nYou'll find most of the same specs on the Rebel model , with the main differences being that the T7i sports a 19-point AF, 5fps continuous shooting and a lighter body. The EOS 77D and Rebel T7i will hit stores in April for $900 and $750 body-only, respectively. Canon says both of these are intended for people who want a camera like the 80D but don't want to spend over $1,000. Or, if you'd rather have a more compact shooter, the new EOS M6 mirrorless may be worth considering.
