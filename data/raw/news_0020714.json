Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA devastated family have been left horrified after their relative was accidentally cremated after a mix-up by funeral directors. \nFather-of-three David Pugh had wanted to be buried at his local church following his death after a long battle against cancer . \nBut there was a mix up following the 58-year-old's death at his home in Bangor, Co Down, Northern Ireland, in January and he was cremated without his family being told beforehand. \nSpeaking to Belfast Live , David's widow Maureen and his daughter Rachel told of their anguish, pain and anger that something like this could happen. \nMaureen, 54, explained: \"The undertakers were called in the early hours of that morning after David passed away, they arrived and his body was taken away. \n\"Then late the next afternoon the undertakers arrived here to tell me that his body had been sent to the crematorium by mistake and the cremation had already taken place by the time they found out. \n\"They spoke to us and told us their version of what went wrong, but basically the wrong body was sent to the crematorium. \n\"They held their hands up and said it was in-house error.\" \nMaureen continued: \"Because the funeral was already planned for a few days later, we decided to go ahead with it because we didn't want the funeral to be overshadowed by the scandal of what happened. David's family have been left devastated (Photo: Belfast Live) \n\"Which then in a way led to a very packed church with a lot of people thinking that this was a straight-forward Christian burial, when it wasn't.\" \nMaureen said they were left not only to deal with the shock of what had happened, but to try and hide the truth from everyone else. \n\"We were sitting looking at a coffin in the Church knowing it was empty and everybody else in the church didn't have a clue, thought he was there getting the Christian burial that he wanted. \n\"The only thing he wanted was to have Christian burial in his church with the BB hymn, and he got neither.\" \nRachel, 26, said it's added pain that her dad was cremated at a service attended by no-one that knew him. \nShe said: \"Since then the whole mix-up has overtaken the shock of the death. \n\"I was livid, I was so angry when I found out. There's no closure for us. It's the fact that he went through a service that wasn't for him, attended by people that didn't know him and none of his family there. \n\"That crematorium was filled with people, but not his loved ones.\" \nShe added: \"It was the deceit on the day of his funeral as well that just really didn't sit well with me at all. It was all I could sit and think about, looking at that coffin thinking he's not actually there when everyone else thinks he is. \n\"The Minister knew what happened because towards the end he was with my dad quite a lot, and we had that to deal with as well.\" \nMaureen said they felt bad for the Minister having to perhaps do something that wasn't within his faith.

Clarke and Sons Funeral Directors in Bangor (Photo: Google) \n\"We asked him, how does this sit with you, that it isn't what the congregation in your church thinks it is, and he said his pastoral care solely at this time was to us, to get us through the day, but he said it was the hardest funeral he ever had to do, because he knew the circumstances. \n\"We had a secret that we had to carry that day, one we didn't want to.\" \nMaureen says the stress of what has happened on top of the grief has taken it's toll on the whole family, with many sleepless nights and stress-related illnesses affecting them all. \n\"Because we are dealing with all of this, the natural grieving of the death has been pushed under the carpet, we haven't had time to process it,\" she said. \nThe Pugh family said it wasn't their intention to go public with the story, but after hearing another media outlet were pursuing the story without speaking to the family, they wanted to put the record straight. \nMaureen said: \"We were notified straight away by Clarke's as soon as it happened and they were willing to help keep our identity a secret. \n\"But the reason we are putting this out is because we have been told that it has got to the media and it wasn't from us. \n\"So we want to be sure that if it's going out there, it's going out there the way it was and not second/third hand news. \n\"We still haven't processed this. We weren't being unrealistic that this would eventually get out, but we had hoped was for a little more grieving time before this was exposed. \n\"We feel now that if the right story is put out there, who we are, what happened and who did it, then hopefully no-one will come back to us down the line and rake this all up again. \n\"I don't want the front of another paper to be filled with nonsense that's not right. \n\"We want to tell it how it is, and it will be out there, but after this we want to be left alone to grieve in peace.\" \nRachel added: \"It's probably better to speak about it now when the wounds are still raw than drag it up in years to come, or wait for it coming.\" \nThe Pugh family said they hope lessons would be learned from what happened so that no family ever has to endure what they are living through. \nA statement from S.Clarke and Sons Funeral Directors said: \"The Company accepts full responsibility for this tragic human error and has offered its sincere and unreserved apology to the families, to whom we will continue to provide support. \n\"A comprehensive review of our operating procedures has since been carried out and additional checks have been implemented. \n\"No incident of this nature has ever occurred in over 100 years of our operation, and we reiterate the familiesâ€™ wishes that their privacy be respected at this difficult time.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:41:47.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
