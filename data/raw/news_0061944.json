He was an integral part of Rhodes' efforts to create an \"echo chamber\" of White House allies during negotiations with Iran.\nThe cover photo on Price's personal Twitter account is a picture of President Obama.\n  Politics and tagged Bill Clinton , Donald Trump , Iran  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:20:11.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
