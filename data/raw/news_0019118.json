The winner will represent Division II in the Baltimore County championship game. \nGast admitted the senior night game against Chesapeake was emotional, but hopes she has several more games at Catonsville High if the Comets earn the top seed in the Class 4A North Region playoffs. \n“It was upsetting knowing it was senior night and we are finally here, but knowing that we have so much more to go and that we are going to go far, it just makes me more excited to keep playing,” said Gast, who will play basketball at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County next season. \nCatonsville coach Mike Mohler said Gast averages 10.5 points and 9.5 rebounds per game. \nShe played varsity for all four seasons, including her first two with her sister, Renee, on the same team. \nRenee Gast played soccer and basketball at Catonsville High before graduating in 2015 and now plays soccer for Towson University. \n“Out of respect for Renee, she [Jen] was going to be second fiddle out of respect and love for her sister,” Mohler said. “I knew the day she graduated, Jen was going to blossom and she did.” \nJen Gast wasn’t the only Comet who played on the same court with her sister. \nBarrett, played the past two varsity seasons with younger sibling and junior Jameila Barrett. \nJameila Barrett scored 14 points against Perry Hall, while her older sister scored all 10 of her points in the second half. \n“I love playing with my sister,” Aakilah Barrett said. “We have so much fun together. It’s nice seeing that we can get along and we can play together and actually have a good time.” \nHaving a good time on and off the court has made her senior season memorable. \n“It’s just been a whole bunch of fun,” Aakilah Barrett said. “The team is full of energy and everybody was happy. We got along so well. I enjoyed it.” \nShe also enjoys watching the starters often stake the team to big early leads. \n“When they [starters] have energy, I feel like it brings us up and it makes us play harder,” Aakilah Barrett said. \nNobody enjoys coming off the bench and sparking the team more than Lally. \nThat was never more evident then in a 59-55 overtime victory over Anacostia in the championship game of the Bernice Sandler Bracket during a holiday tournament. \n“We were down 14 in the first half and I put her [Lally] in and we cut it to four,” Mohler said. “We go down 16 in the second half and I put her in the game and we tied it and won in overtime. That’s all you need to know about what she means to the team.” \nLally has earned her spot as the first guard off the bench and likes the way the team has bonded. \n“I love it,” Lally said. “I think we all get along great and we have a great time as a team.” \nWhat was one of her favorite memories from her senior season? \n“I think definitely senior night, because it was kind of like me, Jen and Aakilah and I think it was kind of like our time to shine and I think we really came out hard and it was the best game we played all season,” Lally said. \nMohler has seen Lally play hard all season and that’s not the only thing he appreciates about her. \n“I can put her anywhere on the floor and she will do whatever we ask,” Mohler said. “She is so fundamental, just a great team player and she’s just a hustler and does all the little things that you ever want, never says boo and always has a smile on her face.” \nBoxscore \nCatonsville 97 \nJen Gast 23, Jasmine Dickey 23, Stashia Daniels 15, Jameila Barrett 14, Aakilah Barrett 10, Maddi McLean 4, Amber Lally 2, Gabby Douglas 2, Cerenity Chambers 2, Alicia Buck 2. \nPerry Hall 31 \nMadison Townsley 9, Camille Becker 8, Brooklyn Jones 4, Kara Dietrich 4, Amaiya Moore 3, Casey Bender 3 \nHalftime: Catonsville 49 Perry Hall 17 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T11:03:02.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
