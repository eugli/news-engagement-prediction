Blackburn then face three successive home matches against Derby County, Wigan Athletic and Cardiff City. Blackburn suffered FA Cup defeat to Man Utd at the weekend \nD avid Dunn and Damien Johnson, the popular former Blackburn players who run the club’s Under-23 side, could be placed in temporary charge of first team training and possibly for the Burton game if no appointment has made by then. \nIn a statement, Blackburn said: “The decision has been taken in order to give the club the best possible chance of climbing to a position of safety in the Championship in the remaining 15 games, which starts with the big trip to Burton Albion on Friday night.” \nCoyle’s appointment last June was never accepted by the majority of Blackburn fans owing to his past association with bitter local rivals but he was operating under difficult circumstances at Ewood Park. Who is the deadliest scorer in Europe? \nB lackburn sold centre-halves Grant Hanley and Shane Duffy to Newcastle and Brighton respectively last summer for a combined fee of £10 million, the latest players to depart in the wide-spreading cost cutting at a club where net debts have spiralled past £100 million. \nOf the 14 players Coyle recruited last summer, only one – Derrick Williams – cost a fee as the manager was forced to bring players in on loan or frees and he also had to contend with an extensive injury list when the sales of key players started to bite. \nAlthough Blackburn had only lost one league match by more than one goal since August, they conceded too many soft, late goals and endured a dreadful start to the campaign that left them playing a game of catch-up. Despite beating league leaders Newcastle home and away, they lost three successive games 3-2 in December and have won just one of their past six in the league.
