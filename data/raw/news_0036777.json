We suspect Jio's speeds are impacted by the high load on the network in the free offer period. Jio carries over 90 per cent of all data traffic in the country currently while we believe their network capacity share is closer to 35 per cent,\" the report said. \nAmong other networks, download speed on Vodafone and Idea network also increased in January over previous month. \nAverage download speed on Vodafone increased to 6.8 mbps from 6.7 mbps and on Idea Network it increased to 6.62 mbps from 5 mbps. \nMobile broadband speed on state-run telecom firm BSNL declined to 3.16 mbps in January from 3.42 mbps in December. \nBroadband speed measurement of other networks were not available in the published data.
