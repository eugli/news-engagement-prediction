In the end the outcome of Brexit will have to be confirmed by Parliament Lord Michael Heseltine \n\"It was perhaps unwise for our Government to suppose that our Parliament should be excluded where all others were included. \n\"Very sensibly, after the Supreme Court interpreted the law, that position was reversed and Parliament was restored to its rightful constitutional role as the ultimate authority. Brexit: Which parts of the UK had the majority vote? Fri, February 17, 2017 Much of the North East of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union including Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, and Northumberland. Newcastle was the only borough to vote to remain.

GETTY The move could mean Theresa May would not be able to leave Brexit talks without a deal \n\"It is, put simply, a decision to ensure that the Commons has the chance to define its role in the exercise of its authority over what most people regard as the defining issue of our time.\" \nSenior Ministers responded angrily to the move, branding Lord Heseltine and his supporters “bad losers who are trying to wreck Brexit”. \nUp to 20 other rebel Tories are believed to be joining Lord Heseltine's rebellion, along with Labour and Lib Dem peers. \nThe bid to derail Britain’s split with Brussels comes as peers also look to force Mrs May to guarantee the rights of EU nationals to remain in Britain after Brexit – before talks even begin.
