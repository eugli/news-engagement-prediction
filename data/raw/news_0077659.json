Taylor Duryea was left with a blood nose after this Ben Cunnington knee. Picture: Michael Klein   \nPort Adelaide’s Nathan Krakouer is also set to miss Round 1 after being offered a one-match suspension for a late bump to the head of St Kilda’s Sean Dempster. \nKrakouer was charged with rough conduct, which was careless and with medium impact. \nThe Power faces a trip to the SCG to play Sydney in the opening week of the season. \nElsewhere, Jesse Hogan can accept a $1,000 fine for umpire contact during Melbourne’s pre-season hitout with Carlton on Saturday. \nThere were no suspensions to come from the AFLW, with Kaitlyn Ashmore and Emma Kearney offered reprimands for separate incidents over the weekend.
