Any material that is prohibited from regular garbage disposal is disposed of through an accredited medical waste collection process.”\nThe clinic is an out-of-hospital surgical site accredited through the College of Physicians and Surgeons.\nPhotos The clinic has asked the building’s landlord to provide a garbage dumpster for just for them, so this does not happen again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:42:16.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
