(Music PEI)\n\"I don't know if people back home realize just how good these folks are,\" said Oakie during a stopover in Toronto. \"They are without a doubt world-class, and you can go to any of these conferences and talk to the delegates and buyers and they'll tell you the same thing. They're some of the best in the world at what they do.\"\nAs many of the delegates didn't know Oakie, he was able to eavesdrop on audience reaction.\n\"It's funny because you stand in the audience or around, and you overhear people talking: 'Geez, I heard that Dylan Menzie, didn't he sound fantastic?' Or Meaghan Blanchard, the same thing,\" said Oakie. \"You really get a sense that they are making an impact.\"\nBig crowd response Oakie said each Island group had a great reception at their official showcases.\nTen Strings and a Goat Skin caused a major stir at the festival, according to Rob Oakie. (Music PEI)\n\"I can tell you that one of the biggest buzz-bands there were Ten Strings and a Goat Skin,\" he said. \"You could not get in the room, and this was a fair-sized ballroom. It was absolutely packed, and I know there was some pretty immediate business being done there.\n\"Vishtan, the same thing. And Gordie MacKeeman? One of the only bands I saw during the whole week that got a standing ovation, which is unusual at a conference. These are hardened festival producers and people like that.\"\nIn addition to the main showcases, the artists also performed at a special suite organized by the East Coast Music Association along with the other Atlantic provinces music associations.\nOakie said that room was packed into the late hours as well.\nFormer Dayboat restaurant gets new life as event space\nUPEI extends semester to make up for storm days\nFrom the Mainstreet interview by Angela Walker", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:25:32.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
