Kennedy laughs during a press conference Aug. 9, 1963. \nFrom Frank Sinatra retooling “High Hopes” for John F. Kennedy's run for the White House, to Ronald Reagan’s ironic use of “Born in the U.S.A” in his re-election bid, and Bill Clinton’s iconic saxophone cover of “Heartbreak Hotel” on The Arsenio Hall Show , popular music and U.S. presidents of have maintained a special relationship. \nAnd the fondness isn’t limited only to the campaign trail, either. For decades, occupants of the White House have recruited superstars to market their national initiatives, whether the adoption of Michael Jackson ’s “Beat It” for the Reagans’ “Just Say No” campaign in 1984, or Michelle Obama’s assembly of Kelly Clarkson , Missy Elliott and many others to create “This Is For My Girls,” as part of her Let Girls Learn operation in 2016. \nIn honor of President’s Day, Billboard recognizes that connection by presenting the top five Hot 100 hits of each presidency since 1960. (Note: The Donald Trump presidency has been currently excluded from this list, as there are only three weeks of Hot 100 data available for the current term.) In many cases, the list of hits produced under each presidential era echo the ongoing national spirit, encompassing periods of reflection, sincerity, and -- just as often -- a desire to hit the dancefloor. \nJohn F. Kennedy (1961-1963): \n5. “Big Bad John” – Jimmy Dean4. “Big Girls Don’t Cry” – The 4 Seasons3. “I Can’t Stop Loving You” – Ray Charles2. “The Twist” – Chubby Checker1. “Tossin’ and Turnin’” – Bobby Lewis \n5. “Hello Dolly!” – Louis Armstrong and the All Stars4. “Love Is Blue (L’Amour Est Bleu)” – Paul Mauriat and His Orchestra3. “I’m a Believer” – The Monkees​2. “I Want to Hold Your Hand” – The Beatles1. “Hey Jude” – The Beatles \n5. “You’re So Vain” – Carly Simon4. “Sugar, Sugar” – The Archies​3. “Aquarius\"/\"Let The Sunshine In” – The 5th Dimension2. “Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree” – Dawn featuring Tony Orlando1. “Let’s Get It On” – Marvin Gaye \n5. “Rhinestone Cowboy” – Glen Campbell4. “A Fifth of Beethoven” – Walter Murphy & The Big Apple Band3. “Play That Funky Music” – Wild Cherry2. “Silly Love Songs” – Wings1. “Tonight’s the Night (Gonna Be Alright)” – Rod Stewart \n5. “Night Fever” – Bee Gees4. “I Just Want to Be Your Everything” – Andy Gibb​​3. “How Deep Is Your Love” – Bee Gees2. “Le Freak” – Chic1. “You Light Up My Life” – Debby Boone \n5. “Every Breath You Take” – The Police4. “Eye of the Tiger” – Survivor3. “Endless Love” – Diana Ross & Lionel Richie2. “Bette Davis Eyes” – Kim Carnes​ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T19:09:41.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
