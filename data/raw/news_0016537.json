Trends Viral \nâ€˜Not againâ€™ was the cry from the Twitteratti as comparisons were quickly drawn with the fateful night of November 8, 2016 when Donald Trump shocked MSM commentators by defeating reported frontrunner Hillary Clinton. \nSimilar to Clinton on election night, the path seemed clear for the Falcons to claim glory. On the cusp of their first championship victory, Atlanta held an incredible lead of 28-3 at one point in the game. \nâ€˜Expertâ€™ predictions gave them a 99 percent chance of winning. When the Patriots tied 28-28 in the final nail-biting minutes of play and took victory in overtime, social media users immediately harked back to Trumpâ€™s historic win. \nTrumpâ€™s son Donald Trump Jr was quick to point out the undeniable similarities between the gameâ€™s turnaround and how the presidential election results had defied pollstersâ€™ predictions.
