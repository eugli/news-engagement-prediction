It was a bruising but brilliant hour of compelling crime drama. Here’s all the talking points from episode one… \nBroadchurch is back on fine form After its superlative 2013 debut, which gripped 10m viewers and bagged four Baftas , Broadchurch’s follow-up series proved a deflating disappointment. Awkwardly combining the reheated Sandbrook cold case with over-wrought courtroom scenes, the sequel proved a critical flop, if not a ratings one. Would this third run represent a return to form? So far, and to much relief all round, signs look promising.\nGoing back to his creation’s roots, writer Chris Chibnall immediately reunited the dream duo of DI Alec Hardy (David Tennant) and DS Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman). The drama began, like series one, with the discovery of a crime that will rock the close-knit Dorset community, with multiple suspects, secrets, twists and turns. In short, all the things that made Broadchurch so great in the first place.\nWatch | Broadchurch - in numbers 01:08 T he now-iconic beach, that upper-case white logo, the icy Nordic noir-ish music… It all induced an anticipatory tingle. Fingers are crossed and hopes are already high. \nJulie Hesmondhalgh stole the show The opening half-hour was virtually a three-hander between Hardy, Miller and traumatised rape victim Trish Winterman - a raw, visceral performance from Julie Hesmondhalgh. Still in shock, the 49-year-old shop worker was wordless for 10 minutes, instead telling her tragic story with tear-streaked face, mournful eyes, broken body language and bewildered expression. \nWhen she did eventually speak, Trish asked three questions: “Do you believe me?”, “Who did this to me?” and “Why did he choose me?” And we thought Hesmondhalgh’s portryal of Coronation Street’s Hayley Cropper was heart-rending. This one was a proper gut-punch. Oof.\nShow stealer: Julie Hesmondhalgh in Broadchurch Credit: Colin Hutton/ITV Procedural scenes were deliberately painstaking F eeling the responsibility of portraying rape on screen - plus possibly because series two was accused of implausibility - Chibnall was careful to show the police handling of Trish in deeply naturalistic detail. At times, the opening act felt more like a docudrama than pure fiction.\nHardy's first lines saw him explaining why he’d placed an evidence sheet on the car seat. We were shown the taking of mouth swabs and urine samples. Clothing was carefully bagged and tagged. Fibres were forensically gathered and sympathetic support staff rallied around. Trish was offered the offered the morning-after pill and issued with a panic alarm. Well-researched and reassuringly thorough, it wasn’t just an illustration of best police practice but hugely powerful too.\nThere’s a sexual predator at large - and three prime suspects so far It became clear that the assault on Trish was pre-meditated and chillingly well-organised. Her attacker lay in wait outside a 50th birthday party at a remote manor house, knocked her unconscious, then took her to a secluded spot and tied her up. \nThis opening episode introduced three possible suspects. First, shady mechanic Jim Atwood (Mark Bazeley, who has form for playing villains), the husband of birthday girl Cath (Sarah Parish). Why did she tell him: “I feel like this is our fault”? Jim also had condoms stashed in his car that matched the wrapper found at the crime scene - although I suspect this will turn out to be due to an extra-marital affair, rather than something more sinister. \nPrime suspects?: Sarah Parish and Lenny Henry in Broadchurch Credit: ITV/Colin Hutton S econd, Trish’s boss Ed Burnett (Lenny Henry) seemed callously unconcerned about Trish and had a punch-up with Jim at the party. The blue twine used to bind Trish’s wrist was later shown stashed in a Flintcombe farm shop bag - but would a rapist really keep his tools in a bag branded with the name of his own business?\nFinally, there’s Trish’s estranged husband Ian (Charlie Higson). He’s so far only been sighted on a photograph in Trish’s house - although it was in front of those fateful cliffs Otherwise, we’re left with bereaved plumber Mark Latimer (Andrew Buchan), a shifty cab driver from Trish’s street and local vicar Rev Paul Coates (Arthur Darvill). Well, it’s about time he had a proper storyline. However, there were around 50 men at the party, so expect red herrings by the shoal. \nHow long will Hardy’s heart hold up? This case is set three years after series two, when we last saw DI Alec Hardy leaving town in a taxi - but now he’s back and has resumed his bickering partnership with local plod Miller. \nThe ever-tetchy Hardy has upgraded his sky blue glorified beach hut for a proper hillside cottage. Thus far, there’s no sign of the heart condition that plagued Hardy during the first two series but there’s still plenty of time to ratchet up the pressure on his pacemaker - especially since he’s the anxious single dad of teen daughter Daisy (Hannah Rae) and there’s a sex attacker on the loose.\nFamily trouble: Hannah Rae and David Tennant in Broadchurch Credit: ITV/Colin Hutton Horrific crime in an enviable location H e’s clearly a monster but the mystery attacker certainly chose a handsome location for his crime: a stunning Tudor mansion with rolling grounds and cascading waterfall. It’s called Axehampton House on-screen but the filming location was Bridehead House in Littlebredy on the Dorset Downs. Worthy of a period drama, you could almost imagine Colin Firth emerging from the lake in a wet white shirt. Ooh, Mr Darcy.\nMiller (and Colman) are as marvellous as ever Olivia Colman as DI Ellie Miller is the soul of the series and it was a joy to spend an hour in her company again. She was gently empathetic with traumatised Trish, ordering Hardy to make the tea (a blow for feminism) and secretly slipping the victim her personal number. She later called her partner a “t**t”, cheerfully confirmed that colleagues call him “S**tface” and scoffed a snack bar she found at the bottom of her handbag.\nIn less cheery news, Miller was furious when son Tom (Adam Wilson, who’s shot up since the last series) got suspended from school for distributing porn to his classmates. Well, you can forgive her some unease about the 15-year-old’s burgeoning sexuality, what with his father being a sex-killer.\nDavid Tennant and Olivia Colman in Broadchurch Credit: ITV/Colin Hutton No sign of THAT slug B roadchurch nerds might remember the symbolic slug from the first series. Spotted on the Millers’ carpet, it represented an intruder in the house - and in the finale, got squashed underfoot by Ellie after she discovered the truth about husband Joe. The notorious gastropod even got its own Twitter account.\nSo I had my eyes peeled for any tell-tale wildlife in this third series opener. Apart from the odd quacking duck or background dog-walker, nothing doing. No sightings yet of Miller’s famed orange North Face anorak either.
