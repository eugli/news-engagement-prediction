Ho / Los Angeles Opera) Mark Swed and Music Critic , who assertively balanced Strauss’ domineering orchestra against a lone soprano.\nBut then none of the men onstage could stand up to her. Tómas Tómasson’s John was virile and bland, the two things he’s not supposed to be. Allan Glassman’s slobbery Herod was well done, but slobbery is slobbery.
