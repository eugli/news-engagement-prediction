The incident occurred while the motorcade was en route from the local airport to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach.\nAfter the motorcade ended, law enforcement officers canvassed the area and found a \"2 x 4\" block by the side of the road, according to the release, which included a photo of what appeared to be a wooden block.\nA middle school student confessed to throwing it and implicated four additional students involved, it said. None of the juveniles have been identified by law enforcement.\nAuthorities will file criminal charges with the local state attorney, the sheriff's office said. Additional details were not immediately available.\n(Reporting by Letitia Stein; Editing by Alan Crosby)\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:08:12.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
