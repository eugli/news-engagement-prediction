Flour, Water, Salt \nPredictably, Manchester has the most retailers of specialised baking products with 75 in 2015, but Wigan is close behind with 60. \nBut it's not just happening in the city centre; Rochdale has actually seen the biggest increase across Greater Manchester, with numbers up by two thirds from 15 to 25 over the same five-year period. \nBut enough about the stats, what does this mean for the hungry bun-lovers looking to get their hands on some good bakes? \nThese are the best bakeries in Greater Manchester. Pollen, Sheffield Street \nUsing organic flour, a 24-hour prove and a French country style baking, the Sheffield Street bakery produces a core range of five sourdough loaves: a white 24 hour-proved sourdough; a seeded granary wholemeal; a 100% rye; a 20% rye; and a barley porridge loaf (where barley mixed with water is added to the dough to give a moist and creamy texture with a distinct flavour). In short, it's exciting stuff, and people will literally queue for hours to get their hands on a loaf. \nPollen also bake a range of pastries including croissants, pain aux raisin, pain aux chocolat and the famous cruffin - a delectable muffin croissant hybrid. Blawd Co, at cafés across Manchester (Photo: Blawd Facebook) \nThe bakers at Blawd - which means flour in Welsh - are the absolute masters at artsy, understated bakes. They're at the opposite end of the caketrum (cake-spectrum) to Milk Jam (see below), but their inspired grown-up treats are some of the best in the city. \nSquirreled away in the basement of super-hip Northern Quarter bar Common , Blawd stock cafés across the city centre, including Federal Cafe, Rapha Cycle Club, The Font, North Tea Power, All The Shapes and of course, Common. Trove, Levenshulme (Photo: @trovefoods) \nTrove is run by husband and wife Marcus and Katy Saide, and together they've built a blossoming baking empire in Levenshulme. The Trove Cafe forms the hub, serving refined breakfast, lunch and cakes alongside top coffee. \nBut Trove is probably best known for its bread, which is served at cafés and restaurants across the city. Wolfhouse Kitchen, Altrincham (Photo: The Wolfhouse Kitchen Facebook) \nEver been seduced by a s'more? You haven't lived. These little beauties are baked by the Wolfhouse Kitchen, one of the traders in the award-winning Altrincham Market . \n#katiescakes are baked fresh every day and displayed in all their glory on the open top counter - not that many people get to see that, mind. The goods fly off the shelf quicker than you can order a cup of coffee next door.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:52:13.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
