I'm proud to throw my post for supporting my CM #OPS . \nNow atleast expecting the MLAs and MPs to support to OPS. Amma is living with us. \n— Hari Prabhakaran (@Hariadmk) February 7, 2017 \nDr Subramaniyan Swamy, the BJP Rajya Sabha MP, also tweeted in support of OPS after latter's press meet got over, stating that \"If this infighting continues in AIADMK then no stable govt is possible.\" If this in-fighting continues in AIADMK then no stable govt is possible. \n— Subramanian Swamy (@Swamy39) February 7, 2017 \nMeanwhile, hundreds gathered outside the house of chief minister O Panneerselvam, while entry into Poes Garden, where VK Sasikala resides, was restricted to MLAs, MPs and senior ministers. \nOutside Panneerselvam's residence, AIADMK cadres played songs from popular MGR movies which used to be played at all party gatherings. Former minister KP Munusamy, a vocal critique of Sasikala, was seen coming out of the Paneerselvam's house around 10.45pm. \nHere are some quick reactions on the issue. Greed of Sasikala is now infront of TN Public. Its upto public now, if they dont want wrong they shud protest in support of #OPannerselvam \n— Shashank Singh (@RccShashank) February 8, 2017 No politician ever had the guts to give such a mass speech like #OPS .We stand by you and support you #OPannerselvam #IsupportOPS #TnPolitics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:54:52.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
