Ron Paul “can not get elected.” Paul and his son Sen. Rand Paul usually dominate the conference’s straw poll. Sen. Ted Cruz won last year’s poll and Trump came in a modest third. \nVIDEO: KRAUTHAMMER: BANNON SHOWS HE WAS THE BRAINS OF OPERATION \nTrump skipped last year’s event during the presidential primary and the group, in response, said the decision “sends a clear message to conservatives.” \nThe Guardian newspaper wrote , “As the real estate developer said of Ron Paul in 2011, “I think he’s a good guy but honestly he has zero chance of being elected. You have to win an election.” Trump won that election, and this will be first time that the conservative movement under Trump will be on full display.” \nKellyanne Conway, a senior advisor to Trump told CPAC that “tomorrow it will be TPAC when he’s here.\" \nOne of Trump's top issues is how he will approach his call to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Trump has recently said that his administration will release a plan in the upcoming weeks, but the issue has been a hot topic for conservatives who want to see the law repealed. \nVIDEO: TED CRUZ ON HOW CONSERVATIVES VIEW TRUMP \nDespite some differences, Trump appears to be gaining support from top conservative leaders. \nMatt Schlapp, the head of the American Conservative Union, which holds the event, said Trump has been “pitch-perfect with conservatives as he starts his administration.” He complemented Trump’s Cabinet selections and his choice to replace Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court. \nSchlapp told NBC News that Trump managed to marry “conservative instincts” to a populist tone. \nGrover Norquist, another CPAC faithful, mentioned Trump’s tax plan and said, “Damn near the entire conservative wish list on tax policy is in his tax reforms.” \nWhite House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon told the CPAC crowd on Thursday that “appreciation” will largely be the theme for Trump during his speech. \nLIST OF CPAC SPEAKERS \nBannon appeared on stage with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus to, according to some reports, show a united front after speculation that Trump’s inner circle is divided. \n“Trump may either accomplish more than Republican presidents did in terms of a conservative agenda, despite all the chaos and drama…or he will redefine conservatism,” Rick Tyler, a GOP strategist and former spokesman for Cruz’s presidential campaign, told NPR. “The movement is at a crossroads, and it remains a known unknown where it is going.” \nBen Howe, a contributing editor at Red State and critic of Trump, told NBC that the conservative wing of the party was divided last year, but this year it is “going to be the ‘Make America Great Again’ CPAC, which is going to be a very different makeup then what I’m accustomed to.” \nEdmund DeMarche is a news editor for FoxNews.com.
