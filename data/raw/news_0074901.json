SIGNS OF STRESS Tiredness, restlessness, difficulty relaxing, headache, stomach distress, including diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, muscle pain, body ache, rapid heartbeat, sleeplessness, sleeping too much, frequent infections, irritability, quick to anger, frustration, moodiness BEAT BLACKOUTS Dr Nand Kumar, professor of psychiatry at the AIIMS, suggests, train your brain for exam by sitting for at least two mock exams at home, where you must simulate exam conditions to the T — get up, have breakfast, change into your uniform and finish an exam in the requisite time Take the exam at a desk in a closed room without an AC or a smartphone and ensure there are no interruptions. \"Mock exams at school are not the same because the surroundings are familiar, you need to be out of your comfort zone,\" says Dr Kumar \nBlackout \n“I study through the year but as we near the exam dates, my mind stops working and I can’t concentrate on anything,” said Shamista Kapuria, a class 12 student from Delhi Public School, who is losing sleep worrying about forgetting what she worked hard to learn. \nShe’s not alone. Close to one in five students surveyed said they have blacked out while writing an exam, which psychiatrists say is a sign of high anxiety. \nRead: Class 12 Boards: Here’s how you can boost your English scores \n“It’s normal to feel anxious during exams and a moderate amount of stress is good as it boosts performance and helps you do your best. But if the pressure gets too much, performance declines and if it’s too little, it leads to underperformance,” says Dr Samir Parikh, director of mental health and behavioural sciences, Fortis Healthcare, that runs a free helpline for students. \nVenting, or talking about what you’re going through, is the most effective way to beat stress. “If you find it difficult to cope, share your feelings with friends, parents, teachers or a professional counsellor to relieve the pressure,” says Dr Parikh. \nBoosting concentration \n“Set realistic targets, four hours of study without a break is not more effective than an hour with a 15-minute break,” says Dr Nand Kumar, professor of psychiatry at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. “Research shows that human brain can only effectively concentrate for up to 45 minutes, after which its capacity to stay alert absorb information falls sharply. My clinical practice has shown that it has decreased further to 15-20 minutes,” Dr Kumar says. \nIn psychology, the phenomenon is defined as ‘vigilance decrement’, which is marked by inattention and distraction from the task at hand. Plan breaks into your revision schedule by splitting the day into hour-long chunks that give you a 10-15 minutes break before you begin again. “Chatting on FB or Snapchat is not the solution, you need to disengage the brain from information by doing something completely different — such as listening to music, singing, sketching, watching a show, playing with your pet, talking to a friend, dancing or some other physical activity,” says Dr Parikh.

If you can’t do without your smartphone, take a short gadget break every hour. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:18:43.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
