'Weather bomb' \nGusts of more than 50mph have reached west Wales and the Isle of Wight. \nThe strong winds are expected to cause flight delays and cancellations across the UK. Aer Lingus has cancelled almost all flights between Ireland and England. \nHeathrow advised passengers to check their flight status before arriving at the airport. \nTrain services will also be disrupted, with Network Rail imposing a 50mph speed limit on the West Coast Mainline. \nBuilding damage and interruptions to power supplies are possible as the storm, likened to a \"weather bomb\" by forecasters, unleashes its power. \nAnyone affected by power cuts is encouraged to dial 105 for further information. Media caption What is a weather bomb? \nIn southern Scotland, 10 to 15cm of snow is expected to fall throughout the Thursday. \nOn higher ground, snowfall could reach 20 to 30cm across Falkirk, South Lanarkshire, East Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, Edinburgh, Dumfries and Galloway and the Lothian region. \nHeavy rain is also likely, with snow expected over high ground across north Wales, north-west England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and East Anglia. \nThe strongest winds are expected to be \"short-lived\" and gone by the evening. Image caption A BBC Weather graphic of the forecast for Storm Doris \nForecasters say there is a risk of flooding in Northern Ireland, and possibly at lower levels in northern England, and the far south of Scotland. \nHowever, the Environment Agency said it had not issued any flood warnings for the UK. \nMore rain and wind is expected to continue through to the weekend and into next week but will not reach the same level as Storm Doris. \nDoris is the latest storm to be named by the Met Office, and follows Angus in November and December's Barbara and Conor.
