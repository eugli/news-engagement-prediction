And this week, as New York Fashion Week kicks off for the women's ready-to-wear shows in NYC, Nike is giving people more chances than ever to scoop up their next pair of head-turners. The sneaker juggernaut has unveiled an intense line-up of limited-edition sneaker drops—some of which see an off-the-moment designer or brand take on a classic Swoosh style, and others which are just fashion-ized versions of beloved Nike styles. \nFirst, there's the NikeLab x Comme Des Garçons see-through Dunks we showed you last week. But they're just the tip of the sneaker-filled iceberg Nike has built up this week. On February 9, the day after the CDG Dunks drop, Nike is dropping not one, or two, but five luxurious versions of various Nike Basketball sneakers, including the Air Force 1 Sport Lux, Blazer Studio Low, Air Foamposite Pro, Zoom Generation and the Flight Bonafide—which is a brand new, futuristic-looking high-top slip-on sneaker. (We should also mention that it's incredibly on-trend these days.) All five of these styles will be available at the Nike pop-up shop located inside Kith. \nThen, on February 10, former Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci has his own version of the Nike Dunk debuting at NikeLab Bergdorf Goodman, NikeLab in Soho, Dover Street Market, Kith Brookyln and Concepts. Though Tisci opted for more traditional materials than the CDG versions, they're not exactly your average Dunks either. They're neither a high nor low top—Nike's calling them a Dunk Chukka—and feature a slightly oversized Nike Swoosh design. They might not be as attention-grabbing as some of the other releases of the week, but they're certainly just as cool. \nThe biggest ticket item of the week hits shelves exclusively in Harlem on February 11. That day marks the official release of the Nike x VLone Air Force 1, a sneaker that was previously only available via raffle at Complexcon and was designed by A$AP Bari through his cult-favorite streetwear brand VLone. Like the version released in December, the style is a black low-top AF1 with orange contrast stitching and Swoosh. However, the new version also features embroidered text at the heel. But it's telling that in a week that's full of big name designers and corporate brand, the most hyped shoe of the bunch is that one that sees Nike taking a risk on an independent designer. \nWith so much good stuff to choose from, the hard part will be just that—choosing. And then of course figuring out what else to wear with your new kicks. While you think about that—or search for a plane ticket to the Big Apple—you can track all of the releases now over at nike.com .
