Others, like Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, are smoothing their terms of engagement, increasingly referring more to “repairing” the law than repealing it. “When you talk about ‘repeal,’ you have just used a word that is very polarizing,” said Representative Tom MacArthur, Republican of New Jersey, who meets weekly with moderate Republicans and Democrats of equal number. “When you go to Democrats and say, ‘Help us repeal,’ that puts them in a box. If you say, ‘Would you help us repair something?’ people start listening in a whole other way.” Others are simply taking credit for the law’s popular provisions, like the one that prohibits insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, applauded some of them in a town hall this week and claimed they were added to the law thanks to her party — a claim that is simply not true. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Representative Scott Taylor, Republican of Virginia, when asked about a House Republican health care plan that would not provide maternity coverage, said he would push for such coverage to be included in any replacement plan, one of many examples where Republicans are likely to divide on policy and provisions. “There’s discussion,” Mr. Taylor said of the plan promoted by the House speaker, Paul Ryan. “It’s not set in stone yet.” Republicans have been worrying about this long before constituents and protesters began jamming their town hall meetings. Shortly after the election, during a Republican retreat in Pennsylvania, many members privately complained about using the repeal as an avenue to defund Planned Parenthood or repealing without a clear replacement plan, according to a recording of the meeting anonymously provided to The New York Times , The Washington Post and other newspapers. On Tuesday night, Mr. MacArthur — one of only nine Republicans to vote against the initial bill to begin the repeal process last month — met with protesters who have been standing outside his office, largely to discuss health care. After the meeting, Mr. MacArthur found himself outside a basement room where a group of local Democrats had gathered, and he wandered in to chat, he said. “We had a really good impromptu discussion,” Mr. MacArthur said. “There are very sincere people in my district who are deeply concerned about where the country is headed and doing what they should do, which is to go to their closest federal representative.” “I think first you do the right thing for the country,” he added, “and then you think about the political ramifications and in this case doing the right thing would be less polarizing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:15:20.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
