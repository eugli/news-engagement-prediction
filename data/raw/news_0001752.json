Please don’t make up attacks,” the daughter of Bill and Hillary Clinton tweeted. \nShe was referring to the Trump adviser’s jaw-dropping fib on MSNBC that President Barack Obama instituted a ban on Iraqi refugees after the “Bowling Green massacre” in America by Iraqi terrorists that wasn’t covered in the media. It wasn’t covered because it never happened — a fact that yugely amused the Twitterverse. \nConway said later she made a mistake and meant to say “Bowling Green terrorists,” referring to two Iraqi-born brothers busted in 2011 in an FBI sting in Kentucky. The media did cover that. And there was no Iraqi refugee ban . Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack ...or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don't make up attacks. — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 3, 2017 \nBut Conway wasn’t about to take that dig from the former first daughter sitting down. She quickly swiped back by bringing up Hillary Clinton’s Bosnia story during a speech in 2008. Clinton had visited the country in 1996 and recounted how she came under sniper fire there. She hadn’t, and she later admitted she had confused the details of the trip. In her tweet, Conway also borrowed one of Trump’s tedious insults and essentially called the Clintons losers. Bosnia lie a Great reminder. And 2 @ChelseaClinton & others, you can't \"invent\" quality candidates either. I misspoke; you lost the election https://t.co/7TwnX2b5yA — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) February 3, 2017 \nArgument apparently over — for now. \nChelsea Clinton has been playing a bigger role in tweeting against the Trump administration , and the tone of her messages has been getting a bit snippier. She has complained about Trump’s edict banning immigrants from seven targeted Muslim-majority nations. — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) January 29, 2017 \nShe has also noted Trump’s bizarre comments about Black History Month (including talking about abolitionist Frederick Douglass as if he were still alive), zinged the appointment of Christian leader Jerry Falwell Jr. to head an education reform task force and ripped Trump’s “global gag rule,” which bars U.S. funding for international organizations that perform abortions or inform women about them. Facts matter. Research matters. At least, both should when lives and human rights are at stake https://t.co/RgxkgE5GMP — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 3, 2017 \nBut she also spoke up late last month on Twitter after trolls attacked Trump’s 10-year-old son, Barron. He “deserves the chance every child does — to be a kid,” she said. But she added that “standing up for every kid also means opposing @POTUS policies that hurt kids.” Barron Trump deserves the chance every child does-to be a kid. Standing up for every kid also means opposing @POTUS policies that hurt kids. — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) January 22, 2017 Related Coverage ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T07:36:08.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
