By Mark Belko / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nSpirit Airlines is touching down in a big way at Pittsburgh International Airport. \nStarting this spring and summer, the ultra low-fare carrier will start flights to seven destinations — Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth, Myrtle Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Las Vegas and Houston — from the Findlay airport. \nDaily flights to Dallas Fort-Worth and seasonal Myrtle Beach ones will start May 25; Fort Lauderdale flights, with service three days a week, will start June 15; daily Orlando and Las Vegas flights on June 22; and daily Los Angeles and Houston service July 13. \nSpirit's arrival at Pittsburgh International marks a major expansion for the airline in Western Pennsylvania. It currently flies to five destinations from Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in Latrobe, including Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Myrtle Beach, putting those flights in direct competition with the new ones at Pittsburgh International about 63 miles away. \nIt is unknown if Spirit is planning any changes at Arnold Palmer. It is holding a press conference at Pittsburgh International this afternoon to discuss the new flights. Neither Spirit nor airport officials were immediately available for comment. \nThe Los Angeles service will fill a void left by American Airlines, which discontinued its flight to that city last week. Southwest is the only other airline to serve LA from Pittsburgh. \nNone of the flights being announced by Spirit are new destinations, It will be competing against other airlines to all of the markets, including four others to Orlando and two others to Fort Lauderdale, Las Vegas, and Houston. \nLike other ultra low fare airlines, Spirit charges extra fees for things like checked bags, all but the smallest carry-ons, seat assignments reserved in advance, and extra legroom. \nLanding Spirit is another coup for the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which operates Pittsburgh International, and its CEO Christina Cassotis. \nSince arriving two years ago, Ms. Cassotis has brought in a number of new carriers, including Frontier, Porter, OneJet, Wow Air, and Condor, The latter two will start service to Iceland and Frankfurt, Germany, respectively, in June. \nIn the last two years, the number of nonstop destinations from the airport has grown from 37 to 68. \nMark Belko: mbelko@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1262.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:06:44.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
