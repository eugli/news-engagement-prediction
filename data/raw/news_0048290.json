French national Samia Lila, 25, thought the scaly surprise was a dog when it clambered its way into the Mimosa Winery in the NSW South Coast restaurant. Footage shows her blocking the 180cm long reptile from screaming customers before wrangling it outside with her bare hands, earning her the nickname 'Goanna Girl' online. Samia Lila lost no time coming to the aid of customers when a massive goanna clambered inside her restaurant 'I looked at it and thought it was a dog at first!...But then I realised it was a goanna,' she told Bega District News. Ms Lila lost no time coming to the aid of customers when the reptile got too close for comfort, putting a chair in its path. 'I wasn't scared, I like reptiles so was a bit excited.'
