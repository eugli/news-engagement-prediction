Close to the Continental Divide, it receives even more snow than most major Colorado resorts and gives it a long season that lasts until April 26 this year. There’s a small village at the foot of the slopes, but most accommodation is a five-minute bus ride away. \nBut… Village at lift base is small and pretty dead at night. The old town is limited for shops and restaurants. \nWho goes there Alpine Answers ( alpineanswers.co.uk ), Ski Independence ( ski-i.com ), Skiworld ( skiworld.co.uk ) \nLes Deux Alpes , France Les Deux Alpes is a long, narrow village on a high, remote col. The highest slopes are at 3,570m and include a glacier popular for summer skiing and boarding – the winter season runs until April 25 this year. Snowboarding is big, and the resort has one of Europe’s top terrain parks. There’s excellent off-piste, too, both locally and in the cult resort of La Grave, linked via a short walk or snowcat tow. \nBut… Piste network modest by big-resort standards, and gets badly congested in places. \nWho goes there Inghams ( inghams.co.uk ), Peak Retreats ( peakretreats.co.uk ), Ski Total ( skitotal.com ) \nVal Thorens , France Val Thorens, part of the Trois Vallées, is Europe’s highest resort at 2,300m, with slopes reaching 3,230m. This means guaranteed good snow over a long season that ends on May 10, after a week packed with events and concerts. Recent investment means the local lift system is impressive, with jumbo gondolas and fast chairs in most key spots. The resort was well designed, with a piste effectively running through it, and nearly all accommodation boasts ski-in/ski-out convenience. \nBut… Not a tree in sight, so lifts and pistes can close in bad weather. Some very crowded runs. \nWho goes there Crystal ( crystalski.co.uk ), Ski Collection ( skicollection.co.uk ), Ski Total ( skitotal.com ) \nIschgl , Austria The ski area is high for the Tirol, with most slopes above 1,800m. Most runs in the local Ischgl sector are also north-west facing, so snow stays in good nick. Après is very lively, and the resort is famous for its opening and closing parties . The slopes are linked to those of Samnaun in Switzerland, and most are wide, well-groomed and ideal for intermediate cruising. \nBut… Village, though chalet-style, has a rather urban, glitzy feel. Not ideal for beginners. \nWho goes there Alpine Answers ( alpineanswers.co.uk ), Ski Total ( skitotal.com ), Zenith ( zenithholidays.co.uk ) \nMammoth , US A six-hour drive from Los Angeles, Mammoth Mountain offers world-class terrain parks and a long season which often lasts until June. Experts can enjoy themselves whatever the weather – there are challenging, above-the-tree-line couloirs, as well as steep, lightly wooded terrain lower down. Intermediates have plenty of groomed cruising, and beginners will find excellent nursery areas and gentle green runs. \nBut… Most lodging is miles from the slopes. Wind can be a problem. \nWho goes there Ski Independence ( ski-i.com ), Ski Safari ( skisafari.com ), Skiworld ( skiworld.co.uk ) \nmammothmountain.com \nÅre, Sweden Åre, strung out along a frozen lake, is Sweden’s biggest downhill ski area, and has a long season which goes on until May 3. \nLate season is a great time to visit because of the long hours of sunlight and warmer temperatures. The slopes suit beginners and families, with mainly green and blue runs set among the trees on the lower part of the mountain. \nBut… Still lots of T-bars. High winds can affect snow and lifts. There are few challenges for experts. \nWho goes there Neilson ( neilson.co.uk ), Ski Safari ( skisafari.com ) \nÅre is one of Scandinavia's most popular resorts (are-sweden.com) \nStubai, Austria The Stubaier Gletscher is one of the most extensive glaciers in the Alps. Most runs are between 2,300m and 3,200m and suit intermediates best. There’s some great off-piste, too, with 11 freeride runs. The nearest village, Neustift, is 20km away – it’s traditional Tirolean with a small area of slopes. There’s another ski area above Fulpmes – all three areas are covered by one lift pass. \nBut… A lot of shuttling up and down from the valley to the glacier.
