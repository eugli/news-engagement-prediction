Gilbert Folk Festival on Feb. 20. (Photo: Michael Schennum/The Republic) \n931   Gilbert Folk Festival has been canceled, and organizers have placed the blame directly on the town of Gilbert.\nIn a statement issued Wednesday, Feb. 9, organizers say they were notified with 10 days left to go before the Saturday, Feb. 18, festival was scheduled to take place that additional permits were required and that Gilbert would not honor previously contracted rates for space at what was the St. Xavier Building. The town assumed control over that building several weeks ago.\nBecause of the short notice, organizers said they had to decide between coming up with several thousands more dollars to hold the event, or continuing the event with less than half the stage performances and workshop space.\nThe town of Gilbert responded with the following statement:\n\"As Gilbert has recently transitioned the operations of the University Building, we have been honoring existing reservations in the building with the information that is available,\" it reads.\n\"Gilbert has processes in place to ensure events are successful, and staff has encouraged the event promoters to follow this event approval process. Town staff has been in contact with promoters of the Gilbert Folk Festival to hear any concerns and to offer suggestions and options for this and all future events to be a successful. This includes options for using town facilities, including the University Building, in the most cost-effective manner and seeking creative solutions to allow the Gilbert Folk Festival and Gilbert Art Walk to co-exist and be successful and still meet the necessary rental requirements for Gilbert. We are committed to working with event promoters to be successful and are hopeful a positive resolution can be worked out in this situation.\"\nThe Folk Festival is a free annual community gathering held to celebrate the talents of local singer/songwriters from all over Arizona.\nLaunched in 2011 by longtime folk supporter Robert Zucker, the festival enjoyed a three-year run initially. After being shelved for lack of funding, it returned last year when local business owners and Gilbert residents Becky Cholewka of Cholewka Law and Shanna Tingom of Heritage Financial Strategies came on board as title sponsors. Last year's event was the biggest yet, with more than 70 acts of live music on six stages throughout downtown Gilbert.\nIn a statement, organizers say they have canceled the event \"out of respect for the sponsors who were no longer guaranteed the advertising exposure they paid for.\"\n“It’s just sad. This was a great festival to spotlight our Heritage district, small businesses and local artists. Although the town likes to say it’s ‘Open to Business,’ its actions continue to be a roadblock for small businesses who are trying to contribute to a vibrant community,\" Cholewka said.\nOrganizers are in the process of contacting sponsors to refund them and to cancel all talent that was booked to perform.\n“For the past 37 years, the time I have been in Arizona, I have given of myself physically, mentally and financially to support our world of folk music. In 2011, I had a dream come true when we launched the first Gilbert Folk Festival … I am devastated,\" Zucker said.\nBergies Coffee Roast House owner Brian Bergeson, whose venue is a long-time supporter of the folk festival, has offered to host the originally scheduled artists on his outdoor stage from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday, Feb.18. Bergies is located at 309 N. Gilbert Road.\nMORE MUSIC: Get the Things to Do app | Phoenix local music news | Concerts this week | February concert guide \nSam Moore plays Trump Inauguration Party Sam Moore   (Photo: Provided by the artist) \nA Rock and Roll Hall of Famer who lived in the Valley for three decades has agreed to perform at the Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration on Thursday, Jan. 19, to celebrate the inauguration of Donald J. Trump. Sam Moore rose to fame on the Southern soul scene of the '60s as the Sam in Sam & Dave, a duo he founded with fellow Georgia native Dave Prater.\n\"As an American, I am honored to perform for President-elect Donald Trump,\" says Moore. \"I was a participant in the civil-rights movement and have seen many positive changes and advancement in my 81 years of living in this wonderful country, but I know we must all join hands and work together with our new president. I honestly believe that if we can accomplish this, the best is yet to come. We all as Americans need to unite behind our new president and give him a chance. He needs everyone’s support to make America greater, stronger and an even better country.”\n\nMoore is best known for the Sam & Dave soul classics \"Hold On I'm Comin',\" \"When Something is Wrong with My Baby,\" \"Soul Man\" and \"I Thank You.\"\nHe moved to the Valley in 1987, but moved to Florida a month ago, according to Danny Zelisko, a local promoter.\nIn 2006, he joined Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello and the Edge to close the Grammy Awards telecast with a tribute to longtime friend and fellow Atlantic Records recording artist Wilson Pickett. More recently, he drew standing ovations for his performances at the Kennedy Center Honors and the Latin Music Songwriters Hall of Fame.\nMoore’s last album, \" Overnight Sensational ,\" produced by Randy Jackson, included collaborations with friends and fans like Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Sting, Vince Gill, Travis Tritt, Paul Rodgers, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Billy Gibbons and Wynonna.\nZia accepting submission for local music compilation Zia Records accepting submissions for \"You Heard Us Back When, Vol. 11\"   (Photo: Zia Records) \nZia Records is now accepting submissions for Volume 11 of its local music compilation series, “You Heard Us Back When.” And by local, they mean anywhere they have a Zia, from here in the Valley to Tucson and Las Vegas.\nThe store is celebrating 10 years of the local music series and 10 years of Record Store Day, a multinational celebration of record stores and the culture they inspire.\nIn keeping with Zia tradition, proceeds from the comp will benefit local charitable organizations. This year, the local chain is teaming with a roster of animal-centric organizations, focused on finding worthy homes for great pets in Zia’s communities. In Phoenix, they’ll work with Arizona Animal Welfare League and AZ Dog Adoptions; in Tucson, they’ll team with the Pima Animal Care Center; and in Las Vegas, they’ll pair with Adopt A Rescue Pet to make a difference for rescue pets.\nInterested parties should drop off a CD along with a complete submission form at any of nine Zia Record Exchange locations between now and Friday, March 3. All physical submissions must be on CD format, and you must include a completed submission form.\nZia is also accepting digital submissions, but only if a copy of the submission sheet is emailed along with the file to info@ziarecords.com. If you are submitting digitally, please use Dropbox, WeTransfer, or Bandcamp to submit a WAV, FLAC or other lossless format file that may be too big for regular e-mail. You may also email MP3 files, but the store would prefer to receive your music in a higher-quality format.\nSubmission forms available online at ziarecords.com. Forms will also be available at every Zia store location.\nThe compilation will be available and on sale at all Zia stores for national Record Store Day, Saturday, April 22.\nFor more information, you can tweet at @ziarecords or email the store at info@ziarecords.com.\nBon Jovi looking for local band to open Phoenix date Jon Bon Jovi: March 2, 1962.   (Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images) \nHave you been livin’ on a prayer, just wishing you had seen if not a million faces maybe somewhere in the neighborhood of 19,000 and rocked them all while opening for Jon Bon Jovi and his bandmates at a big arena concert?\nWell, you may be halfway there, thanks to Bon Jovi’s opening act contest, which offers local bands a chance to share the spotlight with the Jersey rock sensations on their latest tour, in support of an album called “This House is Not for Sale.”\nThis is the third time fans have had an opportunity to open for Bon Jovi, following 2006’s Have A Nice Day Tour and 2010’s The Circle Tour.\nAs Jon Bon Jovi, who announced the competition Tuesday via Facebook Live, says, \"Every great band starts small and builds their rep one show at a time. That's the opportunity we were given and now we want to pay it forward. If you're ready for the arena stage, submit your audition tapes and join us in playing for the best audiences in rock music.\"\nDoes your band have what it takes? Then you should upload your audition video to bonjovi.com/2017-opening-act-contest / or the Bon Jovi and Live Nation Facebook pages. Submissions will be displayed in a live gallery for viewing and sharing. Live Nation will choose 10 finalists, and Bon Jovi management will select a winner for each tour date. All musicians selected as openers will be featured across the Live Nation and Bon Jovi Facebook pages. For rules, visit http://livemu.sc/OACRules.\nThe Phoenix concert is at Talking Stick Resort Arena on March 4. The winner for that concert will be notified on or about Feb. 8.\n'Play' screening raises funds for music education Matty Steinkamp’s “Play: The Documentary” is screening Wednesday, Jan. 11, at Gilbert’s Higley Center for the Performing Arts to benefit the Foundation for Arts, Culture and Education of the East Valley and its signature K-6 music program, Building Bridges.\n  (Photo: Handout, Matty Steinkamp) \nThe local filmmaker traveled from New York to Dublin to San Francisco, filming musicians and music educators sharing not only their music but the role their love of music has played in their lives as a timely plea for getting music education back in U.S. schools.\n\"Music is important and it's all around us whether we know it or not,\" Steinkamp says. \"And if we cut that out on the education side, where does that leave us? If it's never learned, will it continue?\"\nThe crowdfunded documentary will screen at 7 p.m., followed by a Q&A with Steinkamp.\nAll profits from go to Building Bridges, the Foundation's signature music program. Now in its eighth year, Building Bridges has brought music and social education to nearly 18,500 school children from 40 different elementary schools in the East Valley. This year, for the first time, FACE is expanding Building Bridges to include a concert featuring Tom Chapin for children with special needs, specifically children on the autism spectrum.\nAll proceeds from this screening go toward bringing Building Bridges to local K-6 children and participating elementary schools free of charge.\nIt’s not the first time Steinkamp has screened “Play” to raise funds for music education programs.\n“We opened our film to music non-profits all over the country to screen our film in theaters and directly benefit from the ticket sales,” he says. “We did this in Sedona, Long Beach, Minneapolis.\"\nDonations and a silent auction at two sold-out Film Bar screenings here in Phoenix raised funds for the Arizona School for the Arts.\nIt was after a screening with the Long Beach Symphony in California that the board of directors from the Foundation for Arts Culture in Education contacted Steinkamp about having their organization host the largest screening yet at the 1,200-capacity Higley Center.\n“And of course I said yes,” Steinkamp says. “Our goal is to have this event be our largest fundraiser to date. This is the largest venue to screen ‘Play: The Documentary’ and it is very exciting to imagine 1,200 music lovers watching this film together and mobilizing to help keep music in schools.”\nSteinkamp’s documentary was an official selection in the 2016 Phoenix Film Festival and has sold out premiere showings in multiple cities. He’s planning to screen “Play” in Australia in February at the Cobargo Cocos.\n“We are always teaming up with organizations to bring more awareness to this topic,” Steinkamp says. “Music is an important part of helping to create a well-rounded society, it is up to all of us to continue to fight to give students a chance to play music.\"\nA Cappella Syndicate and Taylor Upsahl will perform before the screening at 6:15 p.m.\n1/19-22: D.L. Marble playing NAMM Show D.L. Marble band   (Photo: KIM HADJI) \nTempe rocker D.L. Marble and his bandmates have been chosen to perform at this year’s NAMM Show, an industry trade show in Anaheim that runs from Thursday, Jan. 19, through Sunday, Jan. 22.\n“It’s feels great,” says Marble, whose sound is a blend of alternative-country, old-school rock and roll and blue-eyed soul. “We always see great bands at NAMM. It is an honor to be included this year.”\nAmong the featured performers at this year’s event are former Bon Jovi guitar player Richie Sambora, Michael Jackson guitarist Orianthi and the legendary Ronnie Spector and the Ronettes.\nAsked what he’s hoping to achieve at NAMM, Marble says, “We just want to bring our music to a larger audience, and grow our fan base. We are also currently looking for management and a booking agency, so the more people that hear us the better.”\n1/28: Fourth annual Phoenix Rock Lottery Fairy Bones   (Photo: Rachael Smith) \nIt’s time once again for the annual Phoenix Rock Lottery at Crescent Ballroom, taking place on Saturday, Jan. 28.\nIf you missed the first three years, how it works is that 25 local musicians report to the club in the morning, where a lottery divides them into five new bands. From there, the instant bandmates go their separate ways in groups of five to write three songs and learn one cover, all of which they will perform that same night on the Crescent Ballroom stage.\nAs promoter Stephen Chilton says, there’s “something awesome about seeing 500 people show up to see music that doesn't exist yet.”\nAll proceeds benefit Rosie’s House and their mission to give the underserved youth of greater Phoenix the gift of music education.\n \n“This is always my favorite local show of the year,” Chilton says. “At no other show do you see musicians collaborating with such a diverse group of fellow musicians. In many cases they may never have come together under any other circumstances without the Rock Lottery.”\nThis year's participants are:\nJef Wright (of Roar / Treasure MammaL)\nMarty Welker (El West)\nPat McCarthy (The Stiletto Formal)\nRyan McPhatter (Black Bottom Lighters)\nDave Marquez (PAO Phoenix Afrobeat Orchestra / Mariachi de Grand Ave)\nAmber Johnson (decker.)\nChelsey Louise (Fairy Bones)\nCassidy Hilgers (Sister Lip / Field Tripp)\nJacob Lauxman (Twin Ponies)\nAlex Benson (Okilly Dokilly)\nMark Sunman (The Haymarket Squares)\nCaleb Dailey (Bear State / Flower Festival)\nJake Arrington (There Is Danger / Underground Cities)\nCorey Gloden (Wyves / Dry River Yacht Club)\nZach Zimmerman (American Longspurs)\nTaylor Upsahl (Upsahl)\nHolly Pyle (House of Stairs)\nAustin Rickert (Jerusafunk / Playboy Manbaby)\nJared Geyer (Weslynn)\nJon Rauhouse (Neko Case)\nAldy Montufar (PAO Phoenix Afrobeat Orchestra / Fatigo)\nThomas Knight (Bear Ghost)\nCori Rios (The Hourglass Cats)\nJoshua Hill (The Hill in Mind)\nAusten Mack (Captain Squeegee)\nWant to see more local music news from 2016?
