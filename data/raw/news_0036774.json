The woozy track and its accompanying dramatic music video feature a major shift for Taeyeon, whose previous solo efforts veered towards a more sentimental side that she's displayed on hits like sweeping pop rock anthem “I” and last year’s evocative “11:11.\" \n“I Got Love” is a minimalist, rhythmic pop track that provided a jazzy backdrop to the singer’s impressive vocals. The song’s atypical composition draws on R&B and trap for inspiration and forgoes the intense builds and addicting choruses typical of K-pop, instead focusing on Taeyeon’s impassioned performance and lyrics. The addition of an airy, echoing effect to her rich tone emphasizes the singer’s soulfulness and sultry side, offering an alternative to the softer image featured in her earlier solo releases. \nThe music video for “I Got Love” recalls several other Girls’ Generation projects, including the videos for “The Boys” and “You Think” with their bedazzled, luxurious settings. The dark color palette and sensual dance performance yet again break with Taeyeon’s previously pastel-hued music videos, starting off the soloist’s 2017 on a sophisticated note. \nSince releasing her first solo EP I in 2015, Girls’ Generation lead-vocalist has consistently charted well on multiple Billboard charts. Along with taking first and second place on the K-pop-flooded World Albums charts, I peaked at No. 5 on Heatseekers Albums and 2016’s Why hit No. 15. Taeyeon also landed on the Independent Albums chart, with I hitting No. 38 and her second EP reaching No. 48. \nTake a look at Taeyeon’s edgy music video for “I Got Love:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:52:07.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
