Pool/Staff Photographer Texas Rangers starting pitcher Yu Darvish pitches during the fifth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Globe Life Park on Friday, Sept. 30, 2016, in Arlington. (Smiley N. Pool/The Dallas Morning News) By Jori Epstein , Staff writer Contact Jori Epstein on Twitter: @JoriEpstein First baseman Mark Teixeira hasn't played for Texas in a decade. But the former Ranger could soon find Arlington games back on his schedule. Teixeira - who's since won a World Series and slew of All-Star recognitions across his 14-year career - agreed to terms this week to join ESPN for Baseball Tonight analysis, SportsCenter and more. The gig comes just months after he retired at the end of his contract with the New York Yankees. \nSportsDay sat down with Teixeira to talk about his new gig, the Rangers' 2017 prospects, and how he thinks Jeff Banister and Jon Daniels have positioned the team for long-term success. Here's what he had to say: Will the Rangers win the AL West again? \nSportsDay: In your new position, will you cover the Rangers? I hope so. Now that I'm retired I can consider myself a Rangers, Brave, Angel and Yankee. That's the beautiful thing about being retired. I get to open up to old fans and friends and different cities I played in. \nWhat's your scouting report on the Rangers this season? The Ranger are one of those teams that they've built such a good minor league system that they always seems to refresh the roster with young talent. It's an enviable position for any franchise. They have talent on the major league roster and in the minor league system. \nI'd be surprised if they didn't win the West again. Health is obviously an issue especially with Yu Darvish, but if they stay healthy I don't see any reason they shouldn't win the West. \nWhat should fans most be excited about? To see young guys get their chance. Joey Gallo or Jurickson Profar playing more, guys the fans have been hearing about for years. They have the chance to be All-Stars, special players. I hope they get the opportunity. There's something about this organization and the way that they trust their young players, give them an opportunity to succeed - that's the way it was with me, with [manager] Buck Showalter. Ron Washington had the same attitude when he was there and from all accounts Jeff Banister has done a good job of bringing up young guys and letting them flourish in roles. Continuity - give Jon Daniels a ton of credit for giving young players a chance to succeed. From dealing K's to funding straight A's: How Rangers pitcher Cole Hamels brought education to a village in Africa \nWhat are the team's most pressing needs to address in the coming weeks and at spring training? I think every team could use more pitching. There are cycles in baseball - a few years in a row pitchers dominate, a couple years hitting dominates. Right now look at how many runs are scored last year - bullpens are really getting better. Pitching right now, to get a consistent big-wig guy to make 30 starts is difficult. They're throwing harder than ever before. I'd love to see Yu Darvish stay healthy. He's an ace who's hard to hit and I don't think anyone can beat him in the West. \nWhat do you anticipate from Cole Hamels this season? I was really impressed when Cole Hamels came over from the National League. A lot of people say when you go to the American League, you'll be a worse pitcher. He was better. He's a bona fide ace, has been in the World Series, has won games for a long time. With Darvish and Hamels, that 1-2 punch is really impressive. \nHow do you think the club has changed since you played for it? It's completely turned over. The last player I was with on the Rangers is Ian Kinsler. He's been gone three years now. I think the club definitely has better pitching than when I was with the team. Jon Daniels has done a great job. The Napoli pickup was big for him - didn't have to spend a whole bunch for him but he's a really good middle-of-the-order batter and a leader in the clubhouse. \nI love Dallas. It will always be where I started my career and I'm thankful for the fans, team and community. The future is bright in Texas especially when you have possibly a new stadium in the future; I look at some franchises built for long-term success and the Rangers are definitely one of them. From the plate to the studio \nWhat are you most looking forward to in your new gig? My entire career I've had to analyze the game with kind of a filter. Being a player you protect your teammates, manager and city. You can't really talk out about umpires and other players so you never really get to analyze the game from an objective point of view. Now I get to do that. I get to watch games, watch players and comment on why I think it happened and not have to be filtered by being a teammate and an employee How Rangers signing Mike Napoli impacts Jurickson Profar, Shin-Soo Choo and others \nWill it be weird to comment on guys you played with? I'm sure it'll be a little weird but I've had a great relationship with players throughout my career and feel like I've built up respect with the industry that if I make an analysis, good or bad, it's not personal. I'm not going to play favorites or tear down an enemy. Whether I say you're playing well or playing poorly, they'll know it's fairly. \nWhat will you add to your broadcast team? I bring a unique skill set in that I've been around the game a long time - went through high school, college, minors, majors, played in the biggest market in MLB, the World Series. All of that perspective will help the viewers. ... \nI like to go deeper. Everyone watching the game can see that's a fast ball and Mike Trout hit a homer run. But I can bring things the average fan wouldn't pick up, or understand the dynamics of being a young player coming into star role, a veteran battling injuries, what it's like to be traded at the deadline - I've been traded at the deadline twice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:02:27.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
