Whatever technology we choose should be good for the next 10 to 15 years as we cannot expect our jeepney operators to re-fleet earlier,” Mendoza said. \nThere are about 200,000 registered PUJs in the country. \n“When supply becomes scarce, the price will hit the roof. We cannot be complacent as this scenario is just a matter of time,” he said. Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nMendoza said whatever decision the government, transport groups and other stakeholders will make on the BEEPs, it will have an impact on the country’s environment in the future. \n“Though we cannot totally leave fossil fuel-based engines yet, KAPIT believes that, as we modernize, we have to consider the impact of the technology we choose on our health and environment,” he said. \nFrom just P20 per liter, in less than a year diesel price jumped by 60 percent or P32 per liter. And with excise tax being eyed, diesel will hit P38 to 39 per liter, Mendoza pointed out. \nHe described ethanol as a viable option as it comes from plants like sugar, corn and cassava, and is therefore renewable and promotes zero pollution. \nThe use of bio-ethanol will also support the country’s energy security program as it become less dependent on imported fuels, he said. \nWith ethanol, operators can shift to air-conditioned vehicles, which electric vehicles at the moment cannot do efficiently, Mendoza said. \nWith the use of ethanol-powered aircon vehicles, fare pricing is 20 percent higher as compared to non-aircon jeepneys, which means added income of around P1,000 to P1,200 per day. \nHe said the increased income is more than enough to offset the higher cost of ethanol fuel, which is estimated at P53 per liter. \nAt this price, the average jeepney fuel cost will increase by P560 per day. But due to the increased income, there will still be a net gain of P440 to P640 per day.
