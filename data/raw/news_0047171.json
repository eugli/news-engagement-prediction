The Nigerian winger revealed his battle wound on Snapchat with the 20-year-old posting a picture of his foot along with a bandaged emoji. Iwobi was able to carry on after Jamie Collins' poor challenge on Iwobi's right foot in the first half but he was eventually taken off in the 74th minute. Arsenal star Alex Iwobi showed off his bandaged foot on his personal Snapchat account His injury is thought to have occurred when Sutton's Jamie Collins made a poor challenge Collins escaped punishment from Premier League official Michael Oliver during the highly anticipated FA Cup fifth round tie at Gander Green Lane. Alexis Sanchez came off the bench to replace Iwobi much to the surprise of spectators and pundits alike. Arsene Wenger insisted star man Sanchez was not at risk by playing on Sutton's much-talked about plastic pitch. 'He is a guy who has a strong body,' said Wenger.
