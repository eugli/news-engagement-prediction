Grief psychotherapist Julia Samuel explains how building ‘pillars of strength’ – strategies that support us and, crucially, enable us to keep going – will help us live with and learn from losing a loved one Every day thousands of people die, expectedly and unexpectedly; around 500,000 deaths a year occur in England and Wales. On average every death affects at least five people, which means that millions of people will be hit by the shock of the news. They will forever remember where they were when they heard that their parent, sibling or child was dying or had died. It will impact every aspect of their world for the rest of their lives and ultimately alter their relationships with themselves. Julia Samuel 57, MBE, is a grief psychotherapist who has spent 25 years working with the bereaved both in private practice and the NHS at St Mary’s, Paddington. Death is the great exposer: it forces hidden fault lines and submerged secrets into the open, and reveals to us how crucial those closest to us have been. Love from others is key to helping us to survive the love we have lost. With their support, we can endeavour to find a way to bear the pain of going on without the person who has died – daring to trust in life again. In my profession there is a wealth of well-researched practical strategies as well as psychological understanding, which are essential for anyone who is grieving. I want people to understand that grief is a process that has to be worked through – and experience has taught me that grief is work. Hard work. But if we do the work, it can enable us to heal. Grief doesn’t hit us in tidy phases and stages, nor is it something we forget and move on from. The work involves finding ways of coping with our fear and pain, and adjusting to the ‘new normal’. That most people can somehow find a way to bear the unbearable says much about our extraordinary capacity to evolve as we work towards rebuilding our lives. THE PARADOX OF GRIEF is that finding a way to live with the pain is what enables us to heal. Coping with grief means enduring the pain as it hits (this often feels like a storm crashing over us) and then having a break from it through distraction, busyness and doing things that comfort and soothe us. Every time we alternate between these two poles, we adjust incrementally to the reality that we don’t want to face: that the person we love has died. It is often the behaviours we use to avoid pain that harm us the most. Talking to a friend when something troubles us is a positive behaviour; numbing our pain with alcohol a negative one. The task of the bereaved is to differentiate between them while at the same time learning new behaviours that support our capacity to heal and express pain. The person who has died feels alive to us, even though we know that they are dead. We envisage their body as if they were alive. We wonder if they are lonely, cold or frightened. Death steals the future we hoped for, but it can’t take away the relationship we had We speak to them in our minds and ask them to guide us in the big and little decisions in our lives. We look for them in the street, connect to them through listening to the music they loved or by smelling their clothes. We may have a sense of an ongoing relationship, while knowing that nothing will move forward again. When this is unacknowledged or even denied, our minds may become disordered or unbalanced; but when this is understood, our overwhelming feeling will be one of relief. Alternating ‘letting go’ with ‘holding on’ is something we need to learn to live with. Rituals such as the funeral or visiting the grave give a shape to the letting go; the acknowledgment that this person has died and is no longer physically present. People then assume they must entirely forget their loved one and subsequently suffer guilt for abandoning them, but the relationship does continue, although in a radically different form. Death steals the future we anticipated and hoped for, but it can’t take away the relationship we had. The connection to the dead is maintained through our memories, which are probably the most precious gift we will ever possess. They become part of us, our guides as we carry on with our lives. We may want to be happy again, knowing it is right and fair, but feel guilty because somehow it feels wrong. There is often conflict between our head and our heart: our head knows it was, for example, a terrible accident, but in our heart we feel as if we have done something wrong. These polar opposites need to find a place where they can sit side by side. Understanding that we need to hold both concepts inside us can be liberating. Society approves if the bereaved is brave and getting on with things. Paradoxically, the grief that should cause concern is one that has been cut short, for example by self-medicating. As a society we need to learn to support a healthy grieving and to help people understand that each person goes at their own pace.

Or, if we can’t, that it’s possible to trash what you have and start all over again. Grief is the opposite of this belief: it requires endurance, not avoidance, and forces us to accept that there are some things in this world that cannot be fixed. WHEN A PARTNER DIES Few events are as painful, for it is the death of the dream of an imagined future, as well as the couple’s current life together. It is the end of a mutual set of circumstances: companionship, status and often financial security may all be affected by unwanted change. It is an uncomfortable fact that one study found the recently bereaved are six times more likely to suffer heart disease than the national average, which gives credence to the concept of being ‘broken-hearted’. Another revealed that surviving partners are 66 per cent more likely to die within the first three months after their partner’s death. WHEN A PARENT DIES Usually the first faces our eyes lock on to when we’re born are those of our parents; the first hands to hold are theirs. Every relationship we have is, in some way, related to the foundations that began with our parents. When a parent dies, the intensity of what we feel will depend on the relationship we had. We may feel that the person who loved us most in the world has died, leaving us utterly devastated. Or we may be relieved that it is the end of a relationship that has always been disappointing or hurtful. We may have complex feelings of love and hate, relief and guilt. Undoubtedly it puts us in touch with our own mortality because we are often the next in line to die. WHEN A SIBLING DIES The ideal sibling relationship gives you your ‘team’, the people who are on your side through thick and thin for the rest of your life. The power of the sibling bond can overcome years of non-communication. Brothers and sisters are forever connected through shared genetics, history, secrets, memories and language. While few adult siblings are completely estranged, around one third describe their relationship as distant or rivalrous. This does not make the death of a sibling less difficult, it simply adds a layer of complexity: the loss of an opportunity to repair what has been broken and regret for the actions of the past tend to bring with them their own attendant pain. WHEN A CHILD DIES There is almost nothing more traumatic than the death of a child. It tears up the rule book of life: our children should bury us, not the other way round. The death of a child leaves a fathomless hole and, of all the losses, it takes parents who have lost a child the longest to rebuild their lives. I urge couples, if they feel the need to see a therapist, to do so together. It is a loss that shakes the relationship and family system to the core, and it is hard to recover from without the participation of both parents in counselling. As many parents have said to me, having a child die makes you a member of a club that no one wants to be a member of and leaves many families with a sense that they are now outsiders. In addition, many feel that they have been singled out to have this terrible thing happen to them. Being present or absent at the death of someone we love stays with us for ever If couples can find ways of communicating with each other, they can become closer through their loss, as they are the only two people in the world who understand how the other feels. However, research shows that couples who already have difficulties in their relationship and who don’t seek support are more likely to separate following the death of a child. FACING YOUR OWN DEATH When the eventuality of death has been accepted and the focus is no longer on fighting for life but on finding a way to accept the limited future we may have, there can be a good death. If we choose to believe something that gives us comfort in life and in the face of death, we are likely to suffer less. If we have chosen to talk to the people around us about our dying, they will suffer less, too. Nobody can ever know what the dying person’s experience is like, but we do know that being present or absent at the death of someone we love stays with the people who love them for ever. A death where everyone is aligned in their feelings and thinking is easier. We all want to die painlessly, peacefully and with dignity, and we want to be with the people who love us, in a place where we feel safe. We can’t control the outcome, but we can ensure we use all the means of support to make it as tolerable as possible. 'Grief forces us to accept that there are some things in this world that cannot be fixed,' writes Julia Samuel THE EIGHT PILLARS OF STRENGTH These are the key structures that support us and allow us to rebuild our lives. It takes work and commitment to build the pillars – they don’t just appear out of nowhere. RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PERSON WHO HAS DIED A central pillar is finding ways to externalise that relationship. It might be wearing something that connects you to them, such as a watch or an article of their clothing. Create a memory box in which you place special objects such as their glasses, cards or pressed flowers. Assemble a photograph album or write to them in a journal or in the form of a letter. Cook their favourite recipe. Post an image online that you know they’d have loved. RELATIONSHIP WITH ONESELF We need to be kind to ourselves, listen to our needs and avoid self-criticism. Write down conflicting thoughts such as feeling both relieved and sad. We need defence mechanisms but it is useful to be aware of what ours are. If, for example, we tend to shut down when we are upset, we may not get the support we need. Denial in grief is a natural and important part of self-protection. Acceptance has to be incremental in grief because we couldn’t cope with the full truth all at once. A new loss is likely to bring back the memory of previous losses. We aren’t going mad, nor have we failed to do the necessary grieving in the past. This is normal. WAYS TO EXPRESS GRIEF My big shout is that we all need to find ways of expressing our grief, and it doesn’t matter how we do that. For some it will be talking to family and friends, for others it will be writing a journal, painting, making music or seeing a therapist. There is no right way to express it. The key is finding a way of connecting to our feelings, naming them and then expressing them. If we do this regularly, we begin to manage our pain, which will in turn change over time. TIME takes on different hues in grief. Allow more time to make decisions, both immediate ones with the funeral and long-term ones. We may feel pressured to take action because the feeling of powerlessness is so strong, but only time can ensure the proper reflection that is necessary if regret is to be avoided. Grieving takes longer than anyone wants. We cannot fight it. When we attempt to block it out we make ourselves vulnerable to mental and physical illness. Over time the intensity of the pain lessens and we naturally readjust and re-engage with life. MIND AND BODY will have been impacted by the death of the person we love. We know from neuroscience that every thought has a physiological component that is felt in the body. The pain of grief is often experienced in much the same way as fear and tips our body into a heightened state of alert. We need to establish a regime that helps to regulate the body. The more habitual the action, the more effective it is. The regime should include: Cardiovascular exercise, which helps to ease the feeling of fear. Relaxation or meditation, which helps to manage our anxiety. Eating regularly, without great spikes of sugar, coffee or alcohol, which cause the body to peak and then crash. LIMITS When we experience a life-changing loss, it is likely to affect our performance at work and our reactions in a social context. It is important to recognise the power of saying ‘no’. Paradoxically this enhances the power of ‘yes’, for when we say ‘no’ our subsequent ‘yes’ is infinitely more positive. Friends and family can get bossy when we are grieving and are keen for us to get back into the swing of life, but nobody else can know what our limits are. It is up to us to pay attention to them and voice them clearly. STRUCTURE In the chaos of grief we can feel as if our world has tilted off its axis. It can help to build a pillar of structure (with some flexibility built into it, for too much control can be counterproductive). Develop a structure of good habits: Exercise first thing. Do some work or chores. Take time to remember the person who has died. Choose to do something calming such as buying flowers, having a massage, cooking nice food or listening to music. Have regular times for sleep. Developing a structure of good habits has a multiplying effect: the more we do them, the better we feel. It takes six weeks for a practice to become habitual. FOCUSING People often talk about grief as ‘a knot’ in their stomach. Sometimes their arms, legs or head feel heavy. When there are no words for these bodily sensations, focusing is a way of finding them. Direct your attention internally and breathe into – focus – on this ‘felt sense’. Close your eyes. Breathe slowly and deeply, three times. Direct your attention to the place where there is the most sensation. Find a word that describes that place – does it have a shape, a colour? Is it hard, soft? If the image could speak, what would it say? Then follow where the image takes you.

Julia Samuel is the founder patron of Child Bereavement UK, childbereavementuk.org Jenni Thomas, charity founder Jenni Thomas OBE founded the Child Bereavement Trust (now CBUK) in 1994, the culmination of 20 years’ work in the NHS. The charity supports families and educates professionals when a baby or child of any age dies or is dying, or when a child is facing bereavement. Jenni Thomas, founder of the Child Bereavement Trust The inspiration for the charity came from Jenni’s decades working as a nurse listening to and learning from grieving families. Jenni was the NHS’s first ever baby and child bereavement counsellor in the 1980s and became one of the UK’s leading authorities on grief support and education. Her pioneering work in training health professionals, police and others involved in dealing with death remains the bedrock of CBUK’s work. In addition to being the charity’s chief executive and president, Jenni has produced a number of books and films on loss and grief to support families and teach other professionals. Her achievement at CBUK led to her being joint winner of the Nye Bevan lifetime achievement award for her services to the NHS in 2000. Julia Samuel attended Jenni’s training courses and learned a lot from her. In 2001 Jenni served on the Retained Organs Commission, set up after the scandal of children’s organs retained without parental permission. In 2002 she was awarded the OBE. Throughout her time at the helm of CBUK, Jenni continued to work as an NHS bereavement counsellor. ‘Without the NHS, there would be no CBUK,’ she says. Since leaving CBUK in 2009, Jenni has worked for bereavement charities the Angus Lawson Memorial Trust and Rosie’s Rainbow Fund.
