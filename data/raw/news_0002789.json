Love the swagger the Wizards have now. Just winning every game, Brad Beal putting D’Angelo Russell in his back pocket \nAnd the music guy trolling Swaggy P by playing Fancy whenever he missed a shot. And Swaggy went 1/8 from 3…so I guess it worked. Is Swaggy P a mental midget? Some would say. \nThe Wiz have now won 22 of their last 30, including 16 straight at home. It’s miraculous how they’re doing this. John Wall is just so fucking good, man. While the Cavs are struggling, the Wiz are souring. It’s bizarro world, and it’s awesome.
