The US are not about to do that. \nBoth Altidore and Wood are nominally target forwards for their teams, though they go about the job in different ways. Altidore tends to check back toward the ball, into the pocket of space between midfield and defense, and drags at least the central defenders with him. If there's no second forward to keep the other central defender honest, you can often see multiple players swarming Jozy when he receives a pass with his back to goal – hence his preference for playing with a forward partner rather than a pair of wingers. \nIf he's able to get the ball in those spots, he is the most inventive passer in the forward pool. \nWood is a runner who gets into the teeth of the defense and prefers to receive the ball on the move. On the occasions when he does have to receive with his back to goal, his hold-up play is rugged, but rudimentary – he's very likely to play square or back, and is near the bottom of the list of starting Bundesliga forwards when it comes to chance creation. He's yet to record an assist this season. @MLSAnalyst @PCarrESPN Wood is surprisingly good at holding up the ball but needs to get better at keeping his head up and making decisions — dave braneck (@braneck) April 8, 2016 \nMorris, as a No. 9, is very similar to Wood, though with less hold-up ability, while Zardes and Agudelo are more similar to Altidore. Boyd, meanwhile, is a throwback – a giant target-man who loves to battle and win knockdowns, but with better feet than given credit for. He can be this generation's Alan Gordon . \nBear in mind that I haven't even mentioned Andrew Wooten, a target forward who's having something of a breakout campaign (9g/4a in 1450 minutes) for Sandhausen in the 2.Bundesliga at age 27, nor other potential breakout candidates in their mid-20s like D.C. United's Patrick Mullins or Bjorn Johnsen of Hearts. The US have a lot of depth at this spot. \nWhat's it all mean? \nArena said they'd looked at about 70 players, and listed above are 67. Add your three favorites that you think I missed and call it a day, and also keep in mind there are three guys ( Kekuta Manneh , Stefan Frei and Dom Dwyer ) who are citizens, but haven't yet been cleared by FIFA. \nHe also said that he's seriously looking at a group of about 40 for the qualifiers, one that he'll whittle down to 25 when March arrives. You can probably guess something close to the 40 he'll be seriously evaluating, and there's a good chance a player's club form will do the sorting. \nJorge Villafana, please find a club that'll play you. Geoff Cameron and Tim Howard, please get healthy. Things in the future may be closer than they appear. \nBest guess for March 24 vs. Honduras: \nBut things can and almost assuredly will change between now and then.
