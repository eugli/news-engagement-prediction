I’ll let curbwatching explain: Advertisement \nIt could be any CR-Z, but we have to pick one, and this is one, so here it is. \nIt’s a hybrid, but it doesn’t get particularly good mileage. It looks like a sports car, but it’s not fast or fun. It’s a hatchback, but there’s not much storage space. It’s a two-seater, but no one is going to want to ride with you. \nOh, and it’s got a CVT for a transmission, just to wring out any dregs of joy that might remain. What’s it for? Nobody knows. \n(Suggested by curbwatching ) 4. 2003 Hummer H2 Custom SEMA Build \nThe Hummer H2 wasn’t a particularly purposeful car to begin with, but even a somewhat capable SUV becomes a undrivable mess when you give it a massive lift, wheels that can’t go offroad, and an accident history along with tons of one-off, irreplaceable parts. Advertisement Advertisement \nDonate it to charity and claim it as a tax write off for the shop, that’s as good as it’s going to get with this thing. \n(Suggested by sm70- why not Duesenberg? ) 3. 2016 BMW X6 \nThis BMW X6 is a lone wolf in the market, mainly because it doesn’t know what it wants to be. I’ll let Magnox explain: Advertisement \nYours for only $70,000, used. \nBMW have one or two cars in each of their series that are worth buying. Into those series they have crow-barred lifted coupes, lifted sedans, coupes that aren’t coupes, crossovers, coupe crossovers, lifted coupe crossovers... \nWho buys this stuff? It’s not as if it’s cheap either. \nBMW is becoming the go-to manufacturer of cars no one needs, cars that serve little practical purpose, but marketed to people who have too much money and not enough sense. \n(Suggested by Magnox ) 2. 2007 Cadillac Escalade EXT \nThis Cadillac Escalade EXT , much like Lincoln’s Blackwood, is the lipstick-on-a-pig version of the Chevy Avalanche, and it betrayed everything that made the Escalade tolerable. I’ll let curbwatching explain: Advertisement Advertisement \nA Cadillac Escalade pickup. You’ll never use it to haul things because the pearl white paint might get smudged, and the bed’s too tiny to carry anything good anyway. \nYou don’t get the interior space or extra seats of an SUV. It’s not a status symbol, because it’s old and (relatively) cheap now, and it’s not tough-looking (for people who like that) or cute (for people who like that). \nIt’s the automotive equivalent of the “mermaids” 19th-century carnivals made by sewing together a fish and a monkey. You can see what they were going for, but it’s pointless, kind of disturbing, and it’s not fooling anybody. \n(Suggested by curbwatching ) 1. 2015 Jeep Wrangler Custom SEMA Build \nThe Jeep Wrangler itself is pretty utilitarian, it’s the rugged vehicle that you’d love to have whenever things get hairy. However, when you add a bunch of needless flares and off-road trinkets when you know that the car will never, ever go off-road, that just makes whoever is driving it a compliment-seeking poseur. Advertisement \nThis Wrangler, priced at more than six figures, still has the stock 3.6-liter engine, which probably likes those gaudy, heavy-ass gold dubs even less than you do. This is a bad idea from start to finish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:27:41.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
