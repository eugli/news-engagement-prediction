By Kevin Slane 9:08 AM \nPhillipa Soo, Renée Elise Goldsberry, and Jasmine Cephas Jones — best known for portraying the Schuyler Sisters in the original cast of the Broadway musical Hamilton — made one small change to “America the Beautiful” during their pregame performance at Super Bowl 51. \nWhen the singers reached the line that begins, “And crown thy good with brotherhood,” they snuck in a quick, “…and sisterhood” before finishing with, “from sea to shining sea.” \nHamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda tweeted out his appreciation of the singers’ addition. \n— Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) February 5, 2017 \nAccording to Hamilton music supervisor Alex Lacamoire, Soo, Goldsberry, and Cephas Jones came up with the idea for the sisterhood shout-out. Thanks papa! \n— Alex Lacamoire (@LacketyLac) February 5, 2017 \nFalcons coach Dan Quinn also appeared to enjoy the performers’ change. \n— Jade Le Pape 🦋 (@jlepape007) February 5, 2017 \nAs for Patriots coach Bill Belichick? Well, let’s just say it seemed like he was more focused on the game than the performance. the harshest transition ever pic.twitter.com/n20IkHAYmx \n— Mike Tunison (@xmasape) February 5, 2017 Advertisement ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T16:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:58:57.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
