News 21 Feb 2017, 17:48 IST Kelly Kelly was at RAW backstage when WWE came to Las Vegas \nWhat’s the story? \nAccording to Cage Side Seats, there is a heavy possibility that Kelly Kelly will be returning for a WWE run beyond WrestleMania 33. \nIn case you didn’t know... \nKelly Kelly visited RAW backstage last week when they came to Las Vegas. Kelly Kelly, who stays at Vegas, dropped by, beginning the hints of a return. \nKelly Kelly will be appearing at WrestleMania Axxess. There have been rumours surfacing that WWE has been contacting former female talent, including names such as Victoria. This led to many speculating that there might be a “lumber jill” match at WrestleMania 33. \nKelly Kelly is a former Divas Champion, and she spent six years in WWE before departing. She defeated Brie Bella in 2011 to win her only Divas championship \nThe heart of the matter \nKelly Kelly returning would be interesting, given that she represents the “Divas” era which focused more on sex appeal, rather than characters and in-ring ability. Over the past few years, WWE has been moving away from that era. What her role would be is something that is yet to be seen. \nWhat’s next? \nKelly Kelly may likely return to RAW if she does make a full-time return. Now that Tamina is set to join SmackDown Live, there is more space for Kelly Kelly on RAW. \nSportskeeda’s take \nUnless she’s coming in a managerial or valet role, Kelly Kelly won’t have too much place on the WWE women’s roster, on RAW and SmackDown Live. The days of divas such as Kelly Kelly are long gone, with the two last women of the “Divas” era adapting to the new era of Women’s wrestling. \nKelly Kelly can perhaps take the spot that Emmalina was supposed to have – the attractive model. \nSend us news tips at fightclub@sportskeeda.com Recommended", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:44:33.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
