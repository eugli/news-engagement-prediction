Wanderers press conference 7:47 \n“We still believe we can make the grand final,” he said on Tuesday. “We can win every game. We’re improving in recent weeks and the goals will come for sure.” \nA run to the grand final from the Wanderers would be one out of the box, given they sit seventh on the ladder. \nSotirio said any run would happen by focusing on each game as it came, starting with Sydney. \n“The table doesn’t reflect what we can do,” he said. \n“(Sydney) have weaknesses. Every team has weaknesses. We’ll look at them through the week and see how we can punish them. \n“The last game we played them it was a draw and we had our chances. We have our strengths. We need to apply that (on Saturday) and, hopefully, we get the win.” In their two derbies this season, the Wanderers were smacked 4-0 in round one before showing improvement to draw 0-0 last month at Allianz Stadium. Left-back Jack Clisby shared Sotirio’s hopes they could become the first team this season to knock off Sydney. Wanderers coach Tony Popovic.

We’ve got to play wherever the fixture is. This weekend it’s at ANZ and we’ll be looking to win our first game at ANZ. \n“The boys are still full of confidence regardless of what’s gone on ... our target is to be in that grand final and there’s no reason why we can’t be.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
