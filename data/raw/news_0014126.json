Talking about supporting and motivating talent in the country, the government or any minister from India has never called to appreciate my work,\" Bhamara, who plays for the Texas Legends in the NBA Development League, told IANS in an email interview from Dallas. \n\"I have played with so many players in India, none of them ever called or sent a text to appreciate or congratulate me for my work. It is about the respect for the game and not about anything else. I want other players to promote the game in India as much as they can and get the attention it receives,\" he added. \nThe 7' 2\" Bhamara, who hails from Barnala in Punjab, created history in 2015 by becoming the first Indian to get drafted into an NBA side. \nAP \nA documentary titled \"One in a Billion\" chronicles his journey to become the first Indian-born basketball player drafted into NBA. \nBhamara felt the government should provide monetary help for sports infrastructure and promote the game in India. \"I will continue to do my bit for promoting sports in India but the government's support will be an added benefit. It should work towards providing better opportunities to kids,\" he said. \nHailing from a small village, Bhamara had to go through much turbulence, like the language barrier, to make a name for himself in sports.
