Currently Emma is boasting of wearing a Calvin Klein dress made from used bottles that are 'sourced, mechanically processed and spun into yarns in Italy, with a fully traceable supply chain'. The star wears a coat by Stella McCartney who uses no animal products in her clothing, non-leather trainers and a jumper by eco-friendly Filippa K Emma Watson modelling for Burberry: The company has made a commitment to remove all toxic chemicals from its manufacturing process after singing up to the Greenpeace Detox Catwalk initiative She added: 'This saves energy and reduces CO2 emissions compared to creating brand new polyester fibre. The arm band was created in a carbon-neutral mill.' From actress to activist 2014: Appointed UN Goodwill Ambassador for the HeForShe campaign. 2012: Announced as an ambassador for Camfed International, which is a crusade to educate girls in rural Africa 2012: Designed clothing line for ethical label People Tree A spokesperson for the actress told FEMAIL she offsets her carbon emissions at the end of each year. Before becoming enamoured with eco-fashion, Emma modelled in several campaigns for Burberry, although she left the brand in 2010. A 2014 report by Greenpeace found the company was using toxic chemicals in its clothing production. The company has since eliminated all per- and poly-fluorinated chemicals (PFCs) which cause pollution waterways and have been linked to cancer and foetal abnormalities, from its supply chain. The move comes after signing up to the organisation's Detox Catwalk initiative to be free of hazardous chemicals by 2020. Emma has previously been one of the faces of Lancome. She's currently championing Stella McCartney for not using animal products, but L'Oreal which owns Lancome tests products on animals for the Chinese market But according to Greenpeace the company is currently in 'evolution mode' and needs to do more to meet its goal of detoxing completely from hazardous chemicals in the next three years. Emma also modelled for Lancome up until 2012, which is 100 per cent owned by L'Oreal. She hasn't taken on another fashion or cosmetic brand campaign since. The company insists it does not test products on animals, except where required by law. THE RANK A BRAND VERDICT A spokesperson for the Dutch-based NGO Rank A Brand has shared their research on Burberry and Lancome. Burberry has taken a few steps but should do better. They get a D-rating (on a scale from A to E) with a positive score on 8 out of the 36 criteria (22%) that we have applied for the luxury fashion (22%). They have an Ethical Trading Policy that covers several important topics like no forced or slave labor, no child labor, no discrimination of any kind, a safe and hygienic workplace, labour rights and a sufficient living wage, and they have promised to eliminate all hazardous chemicals in their production process by 2020. However, they have not reduced their climate footprint, they do not report on the proportion of environmentally preferred materials and they don't publicly report outcomes or results of its policies to improve labour conditions at its suppliers. Lancome also gets a D-rating, with a positive score on 4 out of the 26 criteria (15%) that we have applied for the cosmetics sector. They have implemented some measures to reduce their climate and water footprint and they report that 100 per cent of its soy and sesame oil were purchased from fair trade certified sources. However, there is no public policy to phase out all harmful substances and do not specify which portion of their ingredients is renewable, natural or organic. And in China authorities insists on carrying out animal tests on finished products before going to market. A spokesperson for L'Oréal told MailOnline: 'In 1989 L'Oréal completely ceased testing its products on animals, and since 2013, L'Oréal has completely stopped testing ingredients on animals. 'Only one exception prevails for L'Oréal just like all other cosmetic companies: the health authorities in China require some tests on animals for certain products or ingredients. The star is on the first stop of a global press tour for her new film in Paris, and is expected to be travelling for several months 'For over 10 years, L'Oréal has been committed to working alongside the Chinese authorities and scientists to have alternative testing methods recognised, and permit the cosmetic regulation to evolve towards a total and definite elimination of animal testing. 'Thanks to this, since 2014, certain products manufactured and sold in China like shampoo, body wash or make-up are no longer tested on animals.' Burberry also sells in China, meaning its make-up and perfume products have also been tested on animals for the same reasons. MailOnline has contacted the brand for comment. FACTS ON PALM OIL & PFCs PALM OIL The edible vegetable oil is a key ingredient in goods from biscuits to make-up, but it's controversial. A report by Amnesty Internaional last year found a 'wide range of abuses' at Indonesian plantations, including child labour and exposure to toxic chemicals. The practice of 'slash and burn' to clear land for planting is also a major cause of catastrophic wildfires. Expansion of plantations also infringes on the habitats of endangered species such as elephants, rhinos and tigers. PFCs PFCs are chemical compounds that don't exist in nature. Once released into the environment many of them degrade very slowly and enter the food chain. This is making pollution almost irreversible, according to Greenpeace. They have been found, in animals like dolphins and in polar bears' livers and even in human blood. Studies have linked them to reproductive and developmental problems in animals. Meanwhile, other companies such as The Body Shop refuse to sell in China until animal testing ends. According to research by Ethical Consumer subcontractors of L'Oreal who manufacture some of its make-up products, use palm oil and palm derivatives. The equivalent of 300 football fields of rainforest is destroyed every hour to make way for new palm oil plantations, destroying the habitats of creatures such as orangutans who are now critically endangered. L'Oréal's stance on palm oil A spokesperson for L'Oréal told MailOnline: 'Part of our CSR policy is commitment to zero deforestation and we want 100 per cent of our renewable raw materials to be sustainably sourced. 'Since 2010, L’Oreal has been using certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO). 'Today, L’Oréal has decided to go one step further and to work with NGOs on new and more ambitious solutions to achieve our zero deforestation ambition while taking into account local communities. 'We have also been actively engaging with our suppliers to ensure a total traceability of our purchases and that our raw materials are coming from sustainably managed plantations. 'Our goal in the long term is that our procurement of palm oil will be done without any impact on rain forests or peatlands.'
