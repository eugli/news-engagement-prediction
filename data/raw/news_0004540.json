The former Obama administration official allowed that a president should get to decide who advises him, but that going to Bannon for national security advice constituted \"bad judgment.\" \"It reflects a wrong priority to place weight on what a political adviser says rather than on your military and intelligence professionals,\" Sullivan said. \"These are consequential matters of life and death, and politics shouldn't have any part in it.\" Read More Steve Bannon in 2010: 'Islam is not a religion of peace.

The move drew widespread outrage from Trump's opponents because of Bannon's many past controversial statements. Bannon's inclusion in the President's chief national security team drew further outrage. Earlier on Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi referred to Bannon as a \"white supremacist.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:08:02.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
