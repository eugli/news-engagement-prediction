(Getty Images) \nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola has named Marcelo Bielsa as the best coach in the world. \nThe former Argentina, Chile and Athletic Bilbao manager has been out of work since leaving Lazio after just two days in the job last summer. \nBielsa has agreed to take charge of Lille from the start of next season and Guardiola has paid tribute to the 61-year-old for helping him during his career. \n‘My admiration for Marcelo Bielsa is huge because he makes the players much, much better,’ said the City boss. \n‘Still, I didn’t meet one guy, a former player from Marcelo Biesla who speaks no good about him. \n‘They are grateful about his influence on their careers in football. \n‘He helped me a lot with his advice. Whenever I speak with him I always feel like he wants to help me.’ Guardiola admits Bielsa had a huge impact on his career (AFP/Getty Images) Bielsa guided Chile to their first ever victory over Argentina. (AFP/Getty Images) \n‘It is important for me to say this about Marcelo because it doesn’t matter how many titles he had in his career. \n‘We are judged by that – how much success we have, how many titles we have won. \n‘But that is much less influential than how he has influenced football and his football players.
