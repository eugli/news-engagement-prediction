At least 85 per cent read two books a month for learning or educational purposes. If you read for 30 minutes a day you will be doing what the top 1 per cent do. 7am: Breakfast We all know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day; it increases mental alertness, regulates blood sugar and helps to reduce sugar cravings. Richard Branson starts his day with a fruit salad and granola. 'No one would ever mistake me for an expert on engines, but I know one thing: They don't work without fuel,' says billionaire Oprah Winfrey. Our bodies are the same way, which is why I'm passionate about breakfast.' 8am: Start work 1pm: Lunch (for at least one hour) Taking a proper lunch break is something that many highly successful people have in common. They recognise the importance of a proper break for efficiency. If you're in meetings and reading emails all morning, straining your eyes and getting a migraine is just not an option for these individuals. The same goes for your concentration - taking a restorative break will improve your concentration levels for the rest of the day. Millionaires work hard when they're in the office, take at least an hour for lunch and leave by 6pm. That means leaving work at work, so when they are at home they are fully present 6pm: Leave work From my research, billionaires have highly scheduled lives. That's what helps them achieve all that they do, as well as have time for family. That means leaving work at work, so when they are at home they are fully present. 'My day ends when I'm tired and ready to go homeâ€¦ There is always more to be done, more that should be done, always more than can be done,' says Intel founder and former CEO, Andy Grove, who always left the office at 6:30pm every day no matter what was happening. 11pm: Sleep 'Sleep your way to the top', according to Arianna Huffington. She advocates sleeping eight hours a night, as well as banning all electronics from the bedroom. This eliminates the temptation to check work emails in the middle of the night, which can lead to insomnia and stress. Billionaire Bill Gates likes to get seven hours sleep a night, as well as reading before bed. 'I read an hour almost every night. It's part of falling asleep,' he says. Getting more sleep can enhance your creativity, ingenuity, confidence, leadership, and decision-making ability.
