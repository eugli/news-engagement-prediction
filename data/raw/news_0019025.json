Video provided by AFP\nMedia: AFP In Trump's defense, it is understandable that a 70-year-old man and his peers would interpret the \"D\" as \"defense\" or \"decision.\" At the most some could misinterpret \"Easy D\" as a terrible rap name for Donald.\nBut to many on Twitter that \"D\" actually stands for a nickname of male genitalia. If you're still confused, go to Urban Dictionary to read the definition my editor doesn't want me writing.\nWith that knowledge, Twitter users reacted exactly how you would have expected them to react and memes about Trump's relationship with \"easy D\" started appearing.
