He won the District 28 title last weekend at Collingswood in impressive fashion, with a pair of pins and a 5-1 decision over Shawnee's talented James Gross in the championship bout. \nGoodwin is one of several dozens of South Jersey wrestlers with realistic hopes of advancing to the state championships in Atlantic City and earning a spot on the podium as one of the top eight wrestlers in his weight class in New Jersey. \nBut he might be the only one who discovered the sport in November of his freshman year. \n\"Never,\" Goodwin said of his experience on the mat before he surprised his family and friends by declining to try out for basketball and opting for the wrestling room. \nGoodwin said his father, Greg, had wrestled in high school in Pennsylvania, and a couple of his uncles had wrestled at Paul VI. \n\"My dad always used to try to get me to wrestle when I was little,\" Goodwin said. \"I didn't want to have anything to do with it.\" \nGoodwin said his father was \"stunned\" when his son took the mat. \n\"He couldn't believe it,\" Goodwin said. \"He was so happy.\" \nPaul VI coach Rich Venuto was pretty pleased with Goodwin's decision as well. \n\"He's a dream to coach,\" Venuto said. \"This is a kid who never wrestled before his freshman year, and he came out and he's just gotten better and better. \n\"He's such a hard-nosed kid, such a hard worker. He does whatever you ask him to do.\" \nGoodwin was no overnight sensation. He said he won about four bouts at the varsity level as a freshman, although he was more successful as a junior-varsity wrestler. \n\"It was all about learning the sport,\" Goodwin said. \"I didn't know anything. I didn't even know the rules.\" \nGoodwin said he improved a little as a sophomore then made a big jump as a junior, taking second in the districts and winning a few matches at regionals. \nBut this season has been a revelation. Despite missing much of the first month with a rib injury, Goodwin has been dominant on the mat. He's won 14 bouts by fall. He's beaten quality wrestlers such as Gross, Rancocas Valley's Drew Bowker and Cherokee's Shawn Webb. \n\"I thought I was capable,\" Goodwin said. \"I knew I put the work in. I knew I had a chance to have a good year. But if you had told me this two years ago, I never would have believed it.\" \nVenuto said Goodwin combines strength and competitiveness with an easy-going approach that differs from some veterans of the sport. \n\"He doesn't read the boxscores,\" Venuto said. \"He doesn't care who he's wrestling. He's relaxed, doesn't put pressure on himself about the sport. \n\"It's really rare for somebody to start this sport this late and be this good. It's something special.\" \nGoodwin said he likes to \"slow down\" his matches, setting the pace. \n\"A lot of guys come at me hot,\" Goodwin said. \"I want to control the tempo.\" \nGoodwin hasn't decided if he will wrestle in college. So it's possible he's in the final stages of a brief but brilliant career. \nHe would like nothing better than to finish strong, with a region title and a good showing in Atlantic City. \nBut he already knows he made the right decision as a freshman. \n\"It's one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life,\" Goodwin said. \"As soon as I started wrestling, I loved it.\" \n@PhilAnastasia", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:30:10.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
