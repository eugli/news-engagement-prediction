You know. They looked just like the Russian flag. Crowd at CPAC waving these little pro-Trump flags that look exactly like the Russian flag.

Nope. \nThe Trump fans waved that Russian flag bearing Trump’s name, because they didn’t even know it looked like a Russian flag or they didn’t care. And maybe that’s part of the problem. \nImage: Twitter, Peter Hamby", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:54:15.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
