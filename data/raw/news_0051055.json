Media caption Evgenia Kara Murza: \"It seems like it is (a deliberate poisoning)\" \nIt is unclear what prompted the latest collapse. \nHowever, Mr Prokhorov said he was leaving Russia on Sunday \"to go through rehabilitation treatment after his second acute poisoning\". \nHe added: \"The diagnosis in his hospital discharge report is still the same: 'toxic influence of an unknown substance'.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T15:03:19.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
