Photo courtesy of Malacañang \nMANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte is working to change strategy in his effort to resolve Asia's longest-running communist insurgency, according to chief presidential peace adviser Secretary Jesus Dureza. \nDuterte met with leftist Cabinet members Monday night, February 20, to discuss the breakdown of talks with communist rebels. The dinner meeting lasted about 2 hours, according to a source. \n\"He gave specific instructions on how to deal with the present situation including the possible next steps following the cancellation of peace talks and the unilateral ceasefire declarations. He lamented that the almost 50-year-old insurgency and conflict still continue to this day and vowed to work for a strategic shift during his incumbency,\" Dureza said in a statement released Tuesday afternoon, February 21. \nSocial Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo, Agrarian Reform Secretary Rafael Mariano, and National Anti-Poverty Commission chief Liza Maza were nominated to the Cabinet by the National Democratic Front (NDF), which represents communist rebels in talks with government. \nDureza and government chief negotiatior Secretary Silvestre Bello III were also in the dinner meeting. \nAside from Dureza, the other Cabinet members have yet to speak about the dinner meeting. Dureza did not also discuss in his statement the demands that Malacañang issued to the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) on Monday afternoon or just hours before the dinner meeting. \nIn a statement, Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella said the CPP must agree to bilateral ceasefire agreement that will put to a stop the rebel group's collection of revolutionary taxes. While the military called it \"extortion,\" NPA justified it as a legitimate function of the revolutionary government. \nTalks with the NDF seek to institute radical reforms on the country's socio-economic policies in the hope to address the root causes of the armed struggle. The NDF called on Duterte to resume the talks and not waste the gains in the 3 rounds of talks held in Europe. \nOptimism was high when talks formally resumed in August 2016. The military and the communist armed wing New People's Army (NPA) issued unilateral ceasefire declarations that resulted in a 5-month-long peace, the longest ceasefire in the history of the nearly 50-year conflict. \nBut the situation on the ground was growing untenable with both camps accusing the other of ceasefire abuses. The NPA declared on February 1 it was terminating its ceasefire and Duterte responded by scrapping the talks altogether. \nThe military has since launched at least 30 operations against the NPA. Both sides are accusing each other of human rights violations. \nFederalism and other peace tables \nDureza said Duterte also discussed with the Cabinet members his plans with the other peace tables – the Bangsamoro and Cordilleran peace talks. \nDureza said all these peace efforts will help in pushing for Duterte's campaign to shift the Philippines into a federal system of government. \nOn Friday, February 24, Duterte will lead a program in his hometown Davao City to launch the \"renewed\" effort to implement the Comprehensive Agreement of the Bangsamoro (CAB), the final peace deal signed with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). \nDuterte has created the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) that will draft the law that will create and assign more powers to the new Bangsamoro region to replace the current Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. \nDureza said the President also supports aspirations for autonomy in the Cordillera Region. \n\"The President instructed that all these different tracks must gather inputs from the different stakeholders to make the reform agenda inclusive that must eventually lead to the final goal of installing a federal system throughout the country,\" Dureza said. – Rappler.com \nMove, the civic engagement arm of Rappler, is crowdsourcing comments on, and recommendations for, nominees to the Duterte Cabinet. \nYou can post information and opinion on Jesus Dureza on X.
