Purchasing the 70,000 miles you'll need from Alaska costs $1,478 - so there's your first class plane ticket. Using the same trick, a round-trip would set you back around $3,000 (£2,400) - netting you savings in the region of $13,000 (£10,500) for the flights there and back, compared to what you'd pay by booking direct with Qantas. Alaska Airlines has a generous frequent flier program meaning you can instantly buy miles without even taking flight with them, then use them to pay for flights with their partners It's not only this journey that you can cover with purchased air miles, for less than the cost of a first class plane ticket, according to Mr Ott. Why exactly this works, he explained, is thanks in part to Alaska's regular promotions and discounts on the use of miles with its partners. So is there a catch? 'No, just a challenge,' he acknowledged. Travel expert Gilbert Ott, above, is the man behind the blog God Save The Points reveals how buying frequent flier points can save you a fortune on tickets for partner airlines 'Finding seats in just about any cabin to Australia can be time consuming, but for this opportunity, it's totally worth it. 'The best way to search like a pro is to use online tools such as Award Nexus, which emails you if and when seats you want become available.' He added: 'If you'd prefer to search on your own, I'd suggest making a free Qantas frequent flier account. Once you have that, you can search for flights using miles. 'If and when you find one that works for you in first or business, that's when you'll want to buy miles from Alaska and lock it in.'
