Two former police officers have said that the unit, the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), spied on the strike at a time when police were finding it extremely difficult to gather information about the dispute.\nThe pair say that the SDS obtained up-to-date information about the likely tactics and size of demonstrations in support of the strikers. \nAn undercover officer, who spent years pretending to be a left-wing activist, has described how he attended a key demonstration in which the miners - led by Arthur Scargill - showed their solidarity with the Grunwick strikers. \nThis surveillance is just one part of the long-running undercover operation that has seen hundreds of groups infiltrated by police spies since 1968. \nThe public meeting - Spycops and Strikers: From Grunwick to Now - is due to take place on February 15 in central London. More details of the meeting can be found here . \n\nCovert police spied on strikers and their supporters in iconic dispute Read more \nOrganisers of the meeting say that it will discuss how political policing is used to undermine campaigns, and will explore the historic and current impact of undercover policing and surveillance. \nDocuments cataloguing the police’s surveillance of the Grunwick dispute can be read here at the Special Branch Files Project , an online archive of declassified papers concerning the monitoring of political campaigners. \nJournalist Solomon Hughes is due to tell the meeting how he used the freedom of information act to obtain the documents about the Grunwick surveillance , but the police have since tried to keep them under wraps.\nAnother speaker is Eveline Lubbers, one of the main researchers in the Undercover Research Group, a resource on covert infiltration of political groups. \nAlso speaking will be Harriet Wistrich , a lawyer from the Birnberg Peirce law firm who represents a group of women deceived into long-term relationships by undercover police. \nThe meeting is being organised as part of the Grunwick 40 series of events to remember the strike, in co-operation with the Campaign Opposing Police Surveillance , the Special Branch Files Project and the Undercover Research Group. \n• If you would like to pass on information in confidence, you can send a message via the Guardian’s SecureDrop service (see how here ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T13:57:06.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
