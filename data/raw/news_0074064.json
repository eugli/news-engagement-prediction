The ice was from a WestJet plane flying overtop her home and the company has said it will pay for damages.

In 2008, ice from an airplane lavatory hit a home in the southeast.  \nMORE CALGARY NEWS |  Grandma Gertie is 102 — and still volunteering with kids MORE CALGARY NEWS |  Vegan activist, health speaker and author brings message to Calgary, so what's the catch?
