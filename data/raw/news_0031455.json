Fed Chair Yellen Testifies \nFederal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is set to deliver her semi-annual monetary policy testimony on the economy before Senate and House committees in Washington DC. \nYellen is scheduled to testify on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee at 10:00AM ET (15:00GMT) Tuesday. On Wednesday, she will appear in front the House Financial Services Committee also at 10AM ET. \nHer comments will be monitored closely for any new insight on policy and the timing of when it might raise interest rates. \nThe Fed left borrowing costs unchanged earlier this month and gave no firm signal on the timing of its next rate hike. \nFed fund futures are pricing in a less than 15% chance of a rate hike in March, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool . However, odds of a June increase was seen at more than 65%. \nThe U.S. central bank has previously projected three rate increases this year. However, traders remained unconvinced, with markets continuing to price in just two rate hikes during the course of this year. \n2. U.S. January Inflation & Retail Sales \nThe Commerce Department will publish January inflation figures at 8:30AM ET (13:30GMT) Wednesday. Market analysts expect consumer prices to ease up 0.3%, while core inflation is forecast to increase 0.2%. \nOn a yearly base, core CPI is projected to climb 2.1%. Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less. \nRising inflation would be a catalyst to push the Fed toward raising interest rates. \nAt the same time Wednesday, the Commerce Department will publish data on January retail sales . The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0.1% last month, after gaining 0.6% in December. Core sales are forecast to inch up 0.4%, after rising 0.2% a month earlier. \nRising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth, while weaker sales signal a declining economy. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth. \nBesides the inflation and retail sales reports, this week's calendar also features U.S. data on producer prices , industrial production , building permits , housing starts , initial jobless claims , as well as surveys on manufacturing conditions in the Philadelphia and New York regions. \nHeadlines from Washington will most likely continue to dictate market sentiment in the week ahead, as traders focus on President Donald Trump for further details on his promises of tax reform, infrastructure spending and deregulation as well as trade policies. \nEarnings from the likes of PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP ), Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC ) and AIG (NYSE: AIG ) are also on the radar this week. \n3. U.K. CPI, Employment & Retail Sales for January \nThe U.K. Office for National Statistics will release data on consumer price inflation for January at 09:30GMT (4:30AM ET) on Tuesday. Analysts expect consumer prices to rise 1.9%, after increasing 1.6% a month earlier. \nAt 09:30GMT (4:30AM ET) Wednesday, the ONS will publish the monthly jobs report. The claimant count change is expected to rise by 1,000 in January, with the jobless rate holding steady at 4.8%. Wage growth including bonuses is forecast to rise 2.8%. \nOn Friday, the ONS will produce a report on January retail sales at 09:30GMT (4:30AM ET), with analysts expecting an increase of 1.0%, following a drop of 1.9% in the preceding month. \nThe Bank of England raised its forecasts for growth and inflation earlier this month, but appeared in no rush to raise interest rates. \n4. German, Euro Zone Q4 GDP \nGermany will publish a preliminary report on fourth-quarter economic growth at 07:00GMT (2:00AM ET) on Tuesday. The euro zone's largest economy is forecast to expand 0.5% in the October-December period, compared to growth of 0.2% in the preceding quarter. \nThe euro zone will release revised fourth-quarter growth data shortly afterwards at 10:00GMT (05:00AM ET). An initial estimate published late last month showed that the region's economy grew 0.5% in the three months ended December 31, accelerating from growth of 0.4% in the third quarter. \n5. Japan Fourth-Quarter GDP \nJapan will publish preliminary fourth-quarter economic growth data at 23:50GMT (6:50PM ET) on Sunday. The report is expected to reveal that Japan's economy expanded by just 0.3% in the final three months of 2016, maintaining pressure on policymakers to support the world's third largest economy. \nStay up-to-date on all of this week's economic events by visiting: http://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/ The Week Ahead: 5 Things to Watch on the Economic Calendar ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T15:15:10.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
