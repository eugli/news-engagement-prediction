Photo: LTA’s Facebook page More In more than 100 enforcement operations in February, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has impounded several personal mobility devices (PMDs) of users who rode on the roads. The enforcement operations were conducted by LTA’s Active Mobility Enforcement Officers (AMEOs). The officers carried out operations along River Valley Road, Marine Terrace, Bedok North, Yishun, and Alexandra Road in the first two weeks of February, said a statement posted on LTA’s Facebook page on Friday (24 Feb). LTA stressed that it is illegal to ride PMDs on the road as it endangers both the rider and other road users. “We will continue to conduct enforcement operations and take firm action against any rider found breaking the law,” said LTA. AMEOs have also been educating PMD users and cyclists about safe riding habits, PMD technical criteria and where the devices are permissible for use.
