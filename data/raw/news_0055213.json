Photos A post shared by Jamie Foxx (@iamjamiefoxx) on Feb 20, 2017 at 10:57pm PST \nThe Oscar winner was in Dubvronik, Croatia filming for an upcoming movie titled Robin Hood . Jamie Dornan and Taron Egerton are also expected to star in the project that isn't expected to be released until spring 2018. \nThis isn't the first memorable meal Jamie has experienced in 2017. \nBack in January, the actor made headlines after reports surfaced that he was involved in a physical altercation while dining at West Hollywood hotspot Catch LA. Ultimately, Jamie had some fun with the headlines when he took to Instagram and addressed what happened. \n\"\"F--k. The word is out, man. I know y'all heard about this s--t and saw some videos. I just want to address what happened on Saturday from my perspective,\" he shared in a post that has also been deleted. \"All I was trying to do was keep my eye on things.\" \nHe continued while joking, \"I'm just f--king with y'all, man. Everybody's good. 2017, we don't want no violence. We don't want to get hurt and we don't want nobody hurt. But if you want to see my whoop some ass, you know what you can do...\" \nCan't a man just eat in peace?
