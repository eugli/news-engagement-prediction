It is clear that the business had lost its focus and we now have to ensure that we are better equipped to be able to concentrate on the areas that are key to taking Sunderland AFC forward.\n“Our infrastructure provides a tremendous platform and it is important that we capitalise on this by channelling our efforts into those areas that will have an impact. We want to ensure that the football club is in the best possible position to grow stronger, both on and off the field.”\nSunderland’s players spent last week in New York a few days after losing 4-0 to Southampton, with one unnamed member of staff questioning the decision.\n“By all accounts they hardly kicked a ball,” they told the Daily Mail . “It was gym work at the hotel and then out sightseeing and watching basketball matches. I can’t imagine the hotel would have been cheap and then we get this news today. It’s hard to take, to say the least.”\nHowever Bain, who replaced Margaret Byrne as chief executive last year after she admitted making a “serious error of judgment” over her handling of the Adam Johnson child sex abuse case, insisted the decision to announce redundancies had not been taken lightly.\n“The internal process required in order to undertake the changes has already commenced and club staff have been advised of the procedures and timescales involved,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:06:01.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
