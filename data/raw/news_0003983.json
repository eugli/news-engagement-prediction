The daughter understands more than the father.\" \nWhile another commented: \n\"A bridge of friendship is needed between China and the U.S.\" \nMaybe Arabella will be the one to build that bridge! \nPlease be better than your grandpa, kid. \nWatch the singing clip (below)!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:54:18.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
