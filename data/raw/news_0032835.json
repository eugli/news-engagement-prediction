Whenever we come across hurdles, cribbing about our miserable lives and how others are walking a greener path seems to be an easy option. However, there are many who have met with really unfortunate events that changed their lives forever, yet they took it on their shoulders to turn their lives for good and are now living the life that most of us can’t even imagine about. © G Kumaran/Being You \n“While the internet is flooded with pictures of models, celebrities posing, Mission Smile set a trend in creating something unique, different, inspirational, sexy and strong,” Preeti Rai, Co-founder of Mission Smile told MensXP. “Project ‘Rising Above’ is a belief that we can showcase and celebrate the specially-abled. We hope that we set a trend of change in the mindsets of people,” Preeti further added. ‘Rising Above’ is an initiative of Mission Smile, a social organization that came out with India’s first amputee calendar and we are left mesmerized and speechless to say the least. \nIf one is a blade runner, other is a swimmer; if one is a dancer, other is a gold medalist – you might think “what’s the big deal”, well it’s the extraordinary struggle to accomplish what they wanted to do in life. You can also check the campaign on their Facebook page, Being You . Kiran Kanojia © G Kumaran/Being You \nKiran Kanojia’s story is the perfect amalgamation of courage and determination to not let others decide one’s fate. Kiran was on her way to celebrate her birthday with her parents when the mishap happened where a miscreant pushed her off the train while trying to snatch her bag. She was left with no option but to get her left leg amputated. Today, she is India’s first woman Blade Runner and the brand ambassador for Pinkathon. Sheryl Rebecca © G Kumaran/Being You \nDespite losing her leg in a hit and run case, Sheryl aspires to become a model and even walked the ramp in her college. She is a botanist and currently pursuing her post graduation. Do you still need excuses for not trying? Dhaval Khatri © G Kumaran/Being You \nDhaval lost both his arms at the age of 14 when he accidently touched electric wires. Fighting all odds, today he is a renowned painter who has laurels like Miracle World Record and India Book of World to his credit. Briju Mohan and Antara Telang © G Kumaran/Being You \nAntara Telang had to get her right leg amputated at the age of 18 when an overgrown tree fell over. Briju Mohan on the other hand lost his arm in a bike accident. Today Briju is learning contemporary dance form and Salsa is known to be his forte. It’s their shared love for dancing that helped them overcome their disabilities. Vishwas KS © G Kumaran/Being You \nArms are considered to be the prerequisite for being a swimmer, but 26-year-old Vishwas not only changed this perception but also changed the history of Indian sports forever by becoming an exceptional swimmer, despite losing both his hands at the age of 10. What’s more, Vishwas has also won three medals at the Canadian ‘2016 Speedo Can Am Para-swimming Championships’. Vinod Rawat © G Kumaran/Being You \nFrom experiencing a terrible road accident (a truck ran over him at the age of six) to becoming a MTV Roadie and starting a bikers’ club, Vinod’s life is far from being ordinary. He had a really rough childhood and was left shattered when his family didn’t support him. But, he did not give in to his fate and instead decided to write his own life. Even ‘inspiring’ would be an understatement for his fight. Arle Ramchandrarao © G Kumaran/Being You \nWhile on his way to compete at basketball nationals in Goa, Arle Ramchandrarao met with an accident and lost one of his hands. Today he is a great basketball player who plays at district tournaments and competes against able-bodied players. Suyash Jadhav © G Kumaran/Being You \nSuyash is another exceptional swimmer who despite losing both his arms became the only Indian Para swimmer to achieve the ‘A’ qualifying mark for the 2016 Paralympics. Manasi Joshi © G Kumaran/Being You \nAn Indian Para Badminton player, Manasi lost her leg in a road accident but this did not deter her from becoming World No. 5 in single and World No. 3 in Mixed Doubles. She aspires to win Olympic gold in Tokyo 2020 and we are already hoping for her victory. Mariyappan Thangavelu © G Kumaran/Being You \nWon gold in Rio 2016, not an amputee, a paralympic high jumper and India’s first gold winner since 2004, at a young age of 5 he suffered permanent disability when his knee was crushed after being run over by a drunk bus driver while walking towards school. Fighting all odds, he went on to become a paralymic high jumper who made the country proud by winning gold. Samuel T © G Kumaran/Being You \nAt a mere age of six years, Samuel lost his hand when he came in contact with a live wire. He was admitted into St. Mary’s orphanage by his grandparents when they couldn’t afford to take care of him. Today at the age of 13, he is a goal keeper in his school’s hockey team. Shalini Saraswathi © G Kumaran/Being You \nA Blade Runner by profession, Shalini’s fight is truly inspiring and we salute her for the immense courage to stand up and live her life on her own terms. Shalini suffered from a rare bacterial infection, Rickettsial with morts and had 5% chances of surviving. In 2013, her left hand was amputated and her right hand dropped off on its own. Later her legs fell prey to gangerene, but like a true warrior she conquered her miseries with immense courage and is currently training for Tokyo 2020. \nWhile talking about the heroic achievements of these models, Preeti said “Meeting these extraordinary people has changed our perspective on our ordinary lives. We have become better humans and complain lesser.” After reading their stories even we feel the same.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:22:58.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
