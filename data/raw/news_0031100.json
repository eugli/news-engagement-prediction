SUPPLIED \nGarner and crew: Mark Richardson and Amanda Gillies. \nRichardson may have paid too much attention to Garner when he read out 'Five Unprofessional Habits That Could Cost You Your Job', one of them being 'not trying too hard to garner attention'. \nREAD MORE: * Duncan Garner: \"It's all about people\" \nOn dead whales, Richardson suggested they be flogged off to the Japanese, and insulted the status of dolphins when he maintained that whales were the \"humans of the ocean\". \nHe also admonished Garner for being too hard on the Prime Minister, and offered billeting as a solution to the housing crisis whilst promoting cultural awareness. Incidentally the PM's interview with Garner was almost word for word the same interview Bill English gave on Radio New Zealand's Morning Report . \nAziz Al-Sa'afin, the new social media correspondent sat down at the table with Garner rather than sweat it out in the old claustrophobic bunker of the Paul Henry days. Panel guests were regulars from Paul Henry, which felt a little tired, and made you think that MediaWorks was doing AM on the cheap and going for broke on the PM of The Project. \nAside from a familiar-looking set, it also felt familiar when a poll was run on whether Kiwis should engage in Valentine's Day, with Gillies divulging she had once been given a diamond ring on said day. \nThe breakfast show managed to rustle up a so-called exclusive of a housing shortfall of 60,000 homes, a number later disputed by the PM. Ad Feedback \nOpposition leader Andrew Little was interviewed on his party's housing policy as Garner talked over him until the leader regained the upper hand, putting Garner's impudence down to first show nerves. \nActor Rick Hoffman, who plays Louis Litt on the TV show Suits was the celebratory guest. Hoffman described his on-screen character as a \"douche\", a remark which kept being repeated in running text along the bottom of the screen. (Another series of the legal show is about to launch on Lightbox, but there was no mention of the first season debuting this week on Prime TV.) \nFor a first show, the performance of the AM crew was seamless. AM ended with pathos, the cameras pulling back on the set showing Bella Henry, obviously a creature of habit, walking toward the top desk looking as lost as Greyfriars Bobby searching for Daddy.
