Photo: WIRES \nPeople were making well-intentioned attempts to rescue them, but it was safer all round if they did not touch the animals, she said. \nAustralian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) - thought to be carried by less than one per cent of wild bat populations - can be transmitted to humans via a bite or a scratch from an infected animal. Only three cases of human infection have been recorded since the virus was first identified in 1996, but all were fatal. Advertisement \nUnder NSW Health regulations if someone is scratched or bitten by a flying fox, the animal must be tested for ABLV, which results in them being euthanised. \n\"We understand members of the community are very compassionate and care about our native wildlife,\" Ms Stanford said. \"However, if someone is not vaccinated against lyssavirus and attempts to rescue a flying fox, it puts both the member of public and the animal in a potentially dangerous situation. You can keep yourself safe and save their lives if you simply don't touch and just call WIRES as soon as possible.\" \nAs native animals, flying foxes are protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Act. Australia's largest native bat, the grey-headed flying fox, is listed as a vulnerable species. \nMs Stanford said there were high numbers of bats around Sydney, particularly on the south side of the harbour. WIRES has received reports of cruelty as sightings have increased. \n\"In my experience most people are animal lovers and go above and beyond to save the life of an animal in need,\" Ms Stanford said. \"Unfortunately there are the exceptions and each season we deal with upsetting cases. I have seen flying foxes beaten with sticks and injured and recently rushed to the aid of a flying fox that had been tossed out like rubbish in a plastic bag. Unfortunately he died a short time later from his injuries.\" \nWIRES advises that if you see an abandoned, sick or injured flying fox, do not try to catch or handle it. Call WIRES immediately on 1300 094 737 or the WIRES flying fox only emergency hotline on 0405 724 635.
