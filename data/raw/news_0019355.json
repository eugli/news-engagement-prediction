The 6-foot-3, 175-pound junior joined vsporto's SEC Recruiting Buzz this week and said six programs had impressed him with how they have recruited him to date. \n\"I would say Duke, Clemson, Ohio State, Michigan, Georgia, and Auburn,\" Sims said. \nThe Bulldogs offered Sims last October. \n\"I think Georgia is a building program,\" Sims said. \"They are still new and I believe they still have a lot of growing to do. The recruiting class that they just got will definitely put them where they need to be.\" \nSims has a former teammate, Jaden Hunter , who just signed with Georgia. \n\"He tells me people overlook Georgia,\" Sims said. \"That they don't know the inside scoop of what is really going on and what Kirby has planned. He says Kirby is going to get the program to the national championship.\" \nAccording to Sims, most teams are recruiting him to play corner or nickel. Dell McGee is recruiting him to Georgia, and Sims says he connects well with the staff there. \n\"I feel like I could come in and be a big help to the program and just be myself around them,\" Sims said. \"That is just how it is with how they recruit me.\" \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
