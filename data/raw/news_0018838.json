But the soldiers have argued they face the same level of danger as other Canadian troops in the country.\nAnother 300 Canadian soldiers in Kuwait will lose the same tax break in June.\n“It is not reasonable to say that Camp Arifjan has no risk,” an anonymous soldier told CTV News.\nDefence sources told CTV News they’re frustrated because tax decisions are ultimately up to the Finance Department and Treasury Board.\nAll three departments are now under pressure to find a solution.\nConservative defence critic James Bezan slammed the Trudeau government in the House of Commons, asking why the prime minister was “betraying our brave men and women who are in the fight against ISIS.”\nSajjan said they were “committed to looking after our men and women – including their compensation.”\nCanada’s policy is less generous than the United States, whose soldiers in Kuwait qualify for a tax break -- including those working alongside the Canadians.\nRelated Stories Troops serving in Kuwait lose major tax exemption Photos A Canadian military base in Kuwait", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T06:51:38.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
