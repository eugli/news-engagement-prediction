The last three years they have chosen Albie House. The agonising search for a reason why \nFor a long time, Ms Cuthbertson looked for clues but never found an answer. \nWhile the initial grief has passed, she said some days were better than others. \n\"It's something that is the first thing that's on your mind when you wake up and the last thing of a night,\" she said. \nMs Cuthbertson said a crucial part of working through what happened was talking with others who had similarly suffered at a support group.

(ABC News) \nShe met Ruth and Robert Morgan at a suicide support group after their son Matthew took his own life on his 30th birthday. \n\"He was in Los Angeles, he was a commercial airline pilot ... he was living the life of his dreams, the thing that he had always wanted to do,\" Ms Morgan said. \nLike Ms Cuthbertson, the Morgan family has never discovered why their son made that choice, something they had agonised over. \nMs Morgan said it took \"years to stop for your own sanity just trying to work out why\". \n\"I think it's just something that we will never know,\" she said. \nThe Morgan family said the support group was invaluable, but had since lost its funding. \n\"Most of us who were in the support group over a number of years still meet, not as often as we once did, but we maintain the contact,\" Ms Morgan said. Kids 'don't want to pick up a phone' \nLifeline Tasmania agreed that outside of acute emergency settings there was a lack of services for those affected by suicide. Photo: Amanda Cuthbertson said face-to-face interaction with young people was key. (ABC News) \n\"At the moment there is a gap between people being discharged from emergency and actually having a safe place to go to,\" Lifeline Tasmania's Debbie Evans said. \n\"Often when people are discharged they are going home on their own and ultimately are not connected to family or community, so are at risk.\" \nThe Tasmanian Government has launched a suicide prevention strategy with five priority areas identified, including a better coordinated health response system. \nWhile that was welcomed by the Albie House group, Ms Cuthbertson said a non-medical residential facility was needed.

(ABC News) \n\"When we were talking to a lot of youth at a forum they identified they didn't want to pick up the phone and talk to someone, they needed to feel that connection with someone face-to-face,\" she said. \nAlbie House is not planned to be a drop-in centre, but a facility where young people up to the age of 25 can be referred to by a GP, their school, or community group. \n\"It is a service that's never been operated or done before in Australia, it's the first of its kind, that's why it's taken a lot of time in planning and working how to get it up and running,\" she said. \nSo far, Albie House has raised more than $100,000 as well as in-kind support, including the offer of a premises in central Hobart. Next month the first phase of the partnership with Lifeline is set to begin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T11:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:29:08.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
