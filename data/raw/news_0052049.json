Holly Willoughby almost misses The Brit Awards 2017 as she gets stuck in traffic chaos on her way to the O2 Arena \nEmma Bunton was another star to get caught up in the London gridlock By JILL ROBINSON, SHOWBIZ REPORTER 22nd February 2017, 6:52 pm Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Comments HOLLY Willoughby feared she would miss The Brit Awards as she got stuck in traffic on her way to the O2 Arena. \nThe This Morning presenter was heading to the annual music ceremony on Wednesday night with her husband Dan when their car got caught up in the travel chaos near the Blackwall Tunnel, which leads to the venue. Instagram 3 Holly Willoughby has got stuck in traffic on her way to the O2 Arena for The Brits \nTaking to Instagram she posted a picture of the road sign which said: “Blackwall tunnel southbound closed”, writing: “Erm???? Now what happens? #stuck.” \nShe followed it up with a picture of her and Dan in the back of their car, with her husband falling asleep due to the length of time they had been at a standstill. \nPulling a face, Holly wrote: “Some of us are more Brits ready than others!!! #wakeupdan”. Instagram 3 Holly shared a snap of the road sign leading to the O2 \nBefore leaving the house for The Brits, the 35-year-old had shared a snap of her outfit, clearly with the hope that people would actually get to see it on the red carpet. \nWearing a grey sequin mini dress with long sleeves, Holly wore her blonde hair in a middle parting and straight down her back, as opposed to the tousled style she usually adopts on This Morning. A post shared by Holly Willoughby (@hollywilloughby) on Feb 22, 2017 at 8:31am PST \nShe captioned the picture: “Right @brits let’s be having you! #warnerbrits thanks @suzanneneville for my lil sparkly number… always huge thank you to my glam girls @Patsyoneillmakeup @angiesmithstyle @cilerpeksah Earrrings @applesandfigs_jewellery Heels @casadeiofficial Clutch bag @giuseppezanottidesign.” \nHolly wasn’t the only star to fear they would miss the start of the show, as former Spice Girl Emma Bunton also found herself in a desperate dash to the O2. Instagram 3 Emma Bunton and fiance Jade Jones were other famous faces to get caught in travel chaos \nAlso taking to Instagram, the 41-year-old shared a selfie with fiance Jade Jones in the back of their car, writing: “Stuck in traffic!!!! #wanttoparty #gettingimpatient #brits2017”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:13:18.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
