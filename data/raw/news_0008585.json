Over six generations, it's established a following as a reliable entry in a crowded segment filled with best-selling nameplates. The Legacy ultimately is more popular when it's given a wagon body and more ride height—when it becomes the Subaru Outback . \nAlthough available as a wagon in the past, the Legacy is strictly a sedan now. It continues to offer a choice between a 4- or 6-cylinder engine. In its latest iteration, the Legacy is both more fuel-efficient and refined than its forebears and builds on the solid reputation with standard all-wheel drive. \nMORE: Read our 2017 Subaru Legacy review \nAll Legacy and Outback models sold in the U.S. are built in Lafayette, Indiana. \nThe Subaru Legacy is increasingly seen as a strong competitor to better-known and more mainstream models—the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, and Nissan Altima—especially in snowier climates where its all-wheel drive gives it excellent ability to cope with extreme weather. \nThe Legacy added a Sport trim level for 2017, but an updated model with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, plus myriad changes under its skin, arrives for 2018. \nThe new Subaru Legacy \nThe latest Legacy sedan makes a serious effort to establish itself in the family-sedan mainstream—and it succeeds. It's more conventionally handsome than a Toyota Camry, and more spacious than a Chevy Malibu or a Chrysler 200; in fact, the Legacy now is more spacious than the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, and Ford Fusion. Add in good gas mileage and a recent run of great crash-test scores, and the Legacy now throws a few elbows of its own in the mid-size segment. \nTwo powertrains are available. Legacy 2.5i sedans get a 175-horsepower, 2.5-liter flat-4 with acceptable power and fuel economy of up to 30 mpg combined. Legacy 3.6R sedans come with a 256-hp, 3.6-liter flat-6 engine, which doesn't feel quite as strong as it might. \nHelping it appeal to families, the latest Legacy offers more room than its predecessor. Like some other cars in the mid-size class, the interior volume is just under the limit for categorization as a \"Large Car\" by the EPA. The trunk is similarly roomy. The only real detractor is a lack of seat support, which has been common among Subarus recently. \nThe latest Legacy is rated by federal officials at five stars overall and in every crash-test category, a perfect score from the government. It also receives top \"Good\" results in every category from the IIHS, earning it the agency's Top Safety Pick+ award. The Legacy offers an automatic emergency braking system dubbed EyeSight, which uses cameras to help safety systems intercede before accidents happen and also provides adaptive cruise control functionality. \nThe new Legacy marks the debut of a new Subaru infotainment system with a 6.2-inch touchscreen, one that's controlled via big tiles and icons, with swipe and tap gesture control. The Legacy also comes with standard Bluetooth and USB connectivity. \nFor the 2016 model year, the Legacy received a tuned steering and suspension feel, and a lane-keeping system is added to the excellent optional safety equipment. Only a year later, for 2017, the automaker added rear automatic emergency braking and a Sport trim that added bigger wheels, two-tone cloth with accent stitching, and exterior chrome accents. \nSubaru Legacy history \nGoing back a few generations, the 1995 model was a refresh of the original 1989; the Legacy generations introduced in 2000 and 2005 rode on a newer platform. \nInitially, the Legacy was powered by a 2.2-liter flat-4 engine. For 2000, the engine grew in size to 2.5 liters. Over the years, Subaru has offered turbocharged versions of its flat-4 engine in Legacy sedans and wagons, including the sporty Legacy GT model. For 2008, a 3.0-liter flat-6 finally migrated from the Outback wagon and into the Legacy sedan. That engine also grew eventually, with a 3.6-liter version coming online for 2010. \nLegacy GT models—including rare Legacy GT wagons through 2009—used an intercooled and turbocharged performance version of the flat-4 engine. In 2008, a limited-edition \"Spec B\" model was offered. It was the first Subaru to offer SI-Drive, which allows the driver to select among three software profiles for throttle response and shift points: Normal, Sport, and Sport Sharp. The system would later be found on the STI. \nThe fifth-generation Legacy sedan launched in 2010 with the carryover 2.5-liter engine from previous sedans. Also in 2010, the wagon was finally dropped from the Legacy line. Since then, all sedans on the platform have worn Legacy badges, while all wagons carry the renowned Outback nameplate. \nFor 2013, Subaru installed an all-new 2.5-liter flat-4, which produced 173 hp across a broader, flatter torque curve and offered better fuel efficiency. With the company's own continuously variable transmission, it was rated at 27 mpg combined—quite respectable for a car that came with standard all-wheel drive, Subaru's hallmark since 1997. If you ordered the 6-speed manual transmission (a rarity itself among mid-size sedans), the combined rating fell to 24 mpg. High-end Legacy models continued unchanged with the 3.6-liter engine, delivering an unimpressive 20 mpg combined.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:49:04.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
