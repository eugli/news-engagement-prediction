This time around we get to see a real life photo of the Galaxy S8, well, alleged photo of the company’s upcoming flagship. The source really did not share a lot of info along with this image, but luckily for us, this image is quite clear and it reveals quite a few details on its own, and it goes hand-in-hand with some of the previously leaked renders, like the ones that surfaced earlier today . \nAs you can see, this smartphone comes with a curved display on its sides, and the bezel on the bottom of the phone is quite thin. If previous leaks are to be believed, the bezel on the top of the device will also be as thin, proportional to the bezel on the bottom of the device. This phone is made out of metal and glass, and we get to see some ports on the bottom of this smartphone. The 3.5mm headphone jack is a part of this package, luckily, and next to it you’ll notice the Type-C USB port for charging and syncing. Next to the charging port lies a microphone, and on the right, you’ll notice the phone’s bottom-firing speaker. Two separate antenna lines are also quite visible here, as you can see in the provided image. This phone sports curved edges, just like the LG G6 which surfaced quite recently, and as you can see, the phone’s display is turned on in this image. Weibo’s (Chinese social network) mobile site is running on this Galaxy S8 smartphone, in case you were wondering, and judging by the size of the content on the display, we’re looking at a rather large panel here, though it is always possible that the font size has been manually lowered in the settings. \nAs many of you know by now, Samsung allegedly plans to release two variants of the Galaxy S8, the smaller Galaxy S8 variant, and the larger Galaxy S8 Plus model. Interestingly enough, both of these smartphones are expected to ship with rather large displays, the Galaxy S8 is rumored to ship with a 5.7-inch or a 5.8-inch panel, while the Galaxy S8 Plus will come with a 6.1-inch or a 6.2-inch display. Both of those panels will sport QHD resolution, and we’re looking at Samsung’s OLED panels here. Android Nougat will come pre-installed on both of these smartphones, along with the company’s custom UI, of course. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus are expected to land in March or April, and will be fueled by the Snapdragon 835 64-bit octa-core SoC.
