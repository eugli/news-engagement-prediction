Evil witch or hapless half-wit? \nAs the two-part docu-drama The Moorside concluded last night telling the story of how Matthews faked the abduction of her daughter, the question has divided Britain. \nDoes it take a true evil spirit to hide your child in the hope of getting your hands on a £70,000 reward? \nOr is it simple idiocy to think such a ludicrous plot could succeed, dreamed up in the months after millions were raised for missing Madeleine McCann ? \nOr, perhaps most likely, was Karen Matthews simply a willing but witless conspirator in a plan organised by others smart enough to still have escaped justice? \nThe acting and writing of The Moorside has been superb and reignited the country’s interest in the disappearance of Shannon Matthews nine years ago. But I bet few have been so fascinated by it as Shannon herself. \nWhat must it be like for her, now 18, to watch the trauma of her childhood played out in the front room of the home where she has been fostered? \nHow utterly heart-wrenching it must be to see the woman who gave birth to her depicted as laughing and joking while she was missing. And then utterly emotionless when she was found by police. \nBut I wonder if, for Shannon, there is also a strange sense of relief that her mother’s terrible plan propelled her into the spotlight and ended with her being taken into care and her mum being jailed. \nFor in the long term, what would have been far, far worse was if nothing had happened to her that spring of 2008. And instead of being rescued from her utterly dysfunctional “home life”, she’d been left to endure it. \nKaren Matthews had seven children by five different men. She never cooked for the kids, leaving that to boyfriend Craig Meehan or relying on takeaways. \nTheir clothes were dirty and often smelled. She had no interest in getting her kids to school, and teachers had previously reported signs of neglect. \nWith a mother who couldn’t care if she ate or turned up at school, we can imagine what little interest there would have been once Shannon hit adolescence. I imagine she’d have fallen for the charms of the first bloke who paid her some attention – just like her mum before her had done. \nAll the chances are that Shannon would have followed her mum down exactly the same destructive and pointless path. \nWhere had she ever been shown an example to live life differently? \nA recent report showed one in seven 14 or 15-year-olds suffer neglect from one or other parent. \nIn an average class, that’s three kids who aren’t being fed or clothed properly, or who are simply ignored, bullied or abused by parents who either don’t or can’t care properly for their kids. \nThose who suffer emotional neglect are way more likely to start drinking, smoking and playing truant. \nThe damage is done for life. \nFew, like Shannon, are plucked to safety. And even then our care system is often far from caring. \nFor the lucky ones though it is a way out. We must hope Shannon is one of the lucky ones. \nFor while they say there’s nothing like a mother’s love, there is nothing worse than a mother who doesn’t love.
