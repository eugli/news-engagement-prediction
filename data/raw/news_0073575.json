However, it quickly became evident that was not going to happen. Which does mean the industry will have to wait a little longer to see what the Galaxy S8 has to offer, as it is understood that Samsung is planning to host a separate event to officially introduce the Galaxy S8 either in March or in April. Although that does not mean that Samsung does not have a presence at this year’s show as with Samsung being Samsung, this company always has a device or product announcement ready to go and MWC 2017 is no different. \nSamsung’s press events are always one of the most talked-about and biggest draws of an event and so it should be expected that something major will be announced. In fact, in addition to whatever it is that Samsung does plan to introduce at the event, some rumors have suggested that Samsung will also make known the actual launch date for the Galaxy S8. While other reports have gone even further than that by suggesting that Samsung will be showing a Galaxy S8 promo teaser during the event. So it does seem that while the Galaxy S8 will not be physically on show, it will still be part of the show – providing the rumors are correct. While other rumors have even hinted at Samsung showcases a foldable smartphone at this year’s event. So in reality, with the Galaxy S8 not in attendance, this year’s MWC event is proving to be even more of a mystery than ever, with the possibility that Samsung could announce just about anything. \nSamsung’s press event is due to begin at 7 pm local (Barcelona) time and as is usually the case with Samsung, the whole event is being live streamed online. So if you would like to tune in and see what Samsung plans to announce at MWC 2017, or be there if and when Samsung teases the Galaxy S8, then this is the event you will want to be watching and you can by hitting play below.
