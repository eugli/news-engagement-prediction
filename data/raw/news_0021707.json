The national average was 22 per cent.\nThe data comes from an online survey of 825 working Canadians that was conducted by Leger Marketing. The results have a margin of error of +/- 3.4 per cent, 19 times out of 20.\nMonster's survey found that the most motivated workers were in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, where 84 per cent reported feeling motivated. The national average was 76 per cent, while 70 per cent of B.C. residents said they felt motivated.\nAcross Canada, the survey found that working Canadians over the age of 65 were the most motivated at work (85 per cent), and women were slightly more motivated than men (79 per cent versus 74).\nMonster's survey also asked Canadians whether they believed they'd land their dream jobs. In B.C., 44 per cent said they didn't think they ever would, compared to the national average of 35 per cent. Residents of the Prairies were the most pessimistic, with 46 per cent believing they'd never get their dream jobs.\nOne-in-two Canadians of all ages believe they'll find their dream job in the next decade.\nWorkers aged 18 to 34 were more likely to report being unmotivated at work (28 per cent), but were also the most optimistic about finding their dream job, the survey said. About 60 per cent of Millennials said they believed they'd find it in the next five years.\nThe survey also found that Canadians are optimistic about their current jobs, even if it's not their dream job. More than nine-in-ten said they love something about their job, one-quarter said they love their work-life balance, and one-fifth said they love what they do and their daily responsibilities.\nSix per cent said they couldn't find anything to love about their job.\n\"Even if the dream job seems out of reach, the vast majority of Canadians are able to keep motivated in their current job and contribute to their company's success,\" Monster Canada's director of marketing Sheryl Boswell said in a release.\n\"While your current job may not be your 'Mr. Right Job', hard work and dedication are essential since you never know where your job may lead and what doors might be opened for you.\"\nAlthough many B.C. residents feel unmotivated or pessimistic about their dream jobs, about one-fifth said they love what they do. A quarter of those surveyed in the province said they love their work-life balance, and 15 per cent said they love that their job gives them a sense of purpose.\nOnly 3 per cent said they love their boss, the same as the national average. However, that number is only five per cent lower than the region with the highest rate, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.\nA full breakdown of the B.C. results follows:\n27 per cent of workers feel unmotivated at work 70 per cent are motivated 44 per cent believe they will never land their dream job 25 per cent love their work-life balance in their current job 18 per cent love what they do or their daily responsibilities 15 per cent love the sense of purpose they get from their job 3 per cent love their boss", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:31:47.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
