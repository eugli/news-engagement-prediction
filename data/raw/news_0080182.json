The students will be coming back on Sunday, March 5. Parents are advised to take their wards for medical check up before coming back to school, especially for fever.” \nLast week, Minister of Health, Professor Isaac Adewole, directed the Lagos State Ministry of Health, Community Health, and the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, LUTH, to investigate circumstances surrounding the deaths. \nIt was gathered that following a distress call on an alleged outbreak of diarrhoea at the College, the Minister diverted his convoy to the school in the company of the Chief Medical Director, LUTH and met the representative of Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Erinosho, the Principal Dr. Lami Amodu and her staff. \nHe was told that the school is currently on mid-term break, but there were two reported deaths of students at home. One due to febrile illness, with the cause of the second unknown. \nThe Minister then directed the officials of the Ministry of Health, Community Health and LUTH to ascertain the cause of death of the students, inspect the school’s environment, including the kitchen, examine the source of water supply and test its suitability for consumption and also visit the bereaved families, while the report of the investigation will be forwarded to the Minister of Education.
