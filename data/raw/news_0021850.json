We were not able to meet with a suitable doctor of our choice, simply because there was no choice. \nFurthermore, the costs for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), consultation and miscellaneous items made it prohibitive for us to continue seeking second opinions. \nReluctantly, we then decided to go to a polyclinic in a government hospital. \nAnd I was really amazed that there were so many well-trained and experienced specialists to attend to my mother’s case – dentists, neurosurgeons and especially, neuromedical doctors – in our publicly funded health institutions. \nI am really happy to say that the neuromedical specialist not only prescribed a great treatment for my mother, he also took a lot of time to listen to my mother’s grieviences and once even personally wheeled her out from the consultation room when I had to go to the toilet at the time. \nAll this took place in an environment where, as expected, our government clinics and hospitals are constantly crowded and medical staff are eager to clear the queues to shorten waiting times. \nIn retrospect, I can say that waiting times in private clinics and hospitals are now not very different from their government counterparts – both are crowded and there can be a long waiting list for some very expensive services such as the MRI I mentioned above. \nHealth services in our government hospitals are not only virtually free, but in several cases even supersede those in the private sector. \nIt is thanks to the government funding that among other things, I was able to save thousands of ringgit on the MRI costs and several hundreds more per month on the expensive medicines dispensed by the polyclinic’s pharmacy. \nI would like to take this opportunity to convey my immense appreciation to Dr K. Ruban and the other doctors and nurses at the Neuromedical section of Hospital Sultanah Aminah (HSA), Johor Baru. \nMy mother has greatly improved and hopefully, will recover fully one day. \nLast but not least, my gratitude to HSA and the Health Ministry for their enduring service and care to the rakyat. \nJL GOH", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:05:12.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
