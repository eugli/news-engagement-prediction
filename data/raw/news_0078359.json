Mason said he is frustrated that he had very little use of the truck since he bought it, even though he has been making monthly payments. Story continues below \n“I deserve what I purchased, absolutely,” Mason told Global News. \nThe vehicle, which Mason paid $43,000 through a cash deposit and financing, has been sitting on the Village Chrysler lot in Ajax, Ont., since December. It doesn’t run because of a faulty computer module that the dealership has been awaiting to replace for more than two months. According to Fiat Chrysler, the manufacturer of the vehicle, a functioning module won’t be available until the end of March. \nMason’s vehicle is still under a manufacturer and extended warranty. As a result, Fiat Chrysler provided him a rental vehicle at no cost. But Mason said as a contractor who specializes in natural gas installations and fireplaces, a rental sends the wrong message on the job site. \n“My contracts aren’t really appreciative of showing up in a rental van to high-end clients,” he said.

He said he understood how the customer must feel. \n“I like to treat customers the way I like to be treated myself,” said Bateni. \nHe said he would do anything necessary to please Mason, even though the dealership would be taking a direct loss by buying back the vehicle and cancelling the deal struck in November. \n“Give the customer his full money back and hopefully keep him happy,” Bateni said while explaining his intentions. \nMason was delighted and marvelled at the speed of the dealership’s actions. \n“It’s amazing when two guys with a camera and microphone show up how quickly things turn around,” said Mason, adding he plans to look for another suitable vehicle. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
