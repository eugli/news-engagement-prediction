GoFundMe/Charlies chance Little Charlie Fearns was in a race against time to fund the expensive treatment again after it failed GoFundMe/Charlies chance 3 Steven Gerrard donated £25,000 towards his last bout of treatment \nIn a video posted to the Charlie’s Chance Facebook page, his mum said: “We received an email asking us if we would accept a gift off an anonymous donor who wants to pay for the full amount of Charlie’s treatment. \n“We are completely overwhelmed because this is not something we thought anyone would be able to do. \n“We don’t know who this donor is, but wherever you are, I hope you know from the of our hearts it means an incredible amount.” Last year the youngster’s family raised more than £150,000 for Charlie to undergo pioneering Car T-cell therapy after he was diagnosed with the condition for a third time. \nFormer England captain Steven Gerrard was among the kindhearted donors who supported the appeal, giving £25,000. \nBut in a devastating blow, the treatment failed, meaning Charlie needs to have it again – costing another £150,000 – within two months. \nCharlie’s dad said: “The anonymous donor requested to be able to donate directly to Charlie which is bizarre. We thought we were going to have to fight to the nail to raise the money. 3 Seattle Children’s Hospital in the US contacted Charlie’s family to say an anonymous donation had been made \nIn a race against time, the family managed to raise £1,500 in the first few days of setting up the new fundraising appeal. \nBut the incredible donation means Charlie can start the treatment he needs again. \nRob said: “We had been taking on the role of helping other families through Charlie’s Chance but now we are in this position we need to concentrate on Charlie.” \n“The support from everyone has been incredible – that’s never been in doubt from day one – and we want to thank them for it.” \nUpdates on Charlie’s Chance and fundraising events can be found on the Facebook page here or @Charlieschance on Twitter. \nTo make a donation visit the Charlie’s Chance appeal page here . \nAre you the anonymous donor?
