Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON – Tom Brady’s legs were spent, no surprise there, not after they carried him to the most sensational comeback in Super Bowl history. Yet there was still just enough sap left in them to spirit the New England Patriots quarterback away from the scene of his finest triumph as speedily as possible. \nBrady’s masterpiece and the nature of it means he will never forget NRG Stadium, but the true meaning of this epic for him was with the people who helped him on the way and he couldn’t wait to be with them. \n“They are my everything,” he said. \nHe was talking about his family, his ailing mother Galynn, his father Tom Sr., his wife Gisele Bundchen, his daughters, sisters and extended relatives who believed in him when Roger Goodell laid down the hammer and the Deflategate punishment robbed him off the first four games of the season. \nMORE SUPER BOWL COVERAGE: Patriots deserved Julian Edelman's spectacular catch \nHe’d seen them briefly on the field after the Atlanta Falcons were beaten in overtime 34-28, exchanging quick hugs with all before being dragged off to receive the Vince Lombardi Trophy and the MVP award on a night that adds perhaps the most remarkable chapter of all to the Brady opus. \nTo see Brady at his most emotional you need to bring up the subject of his family. His voice cracked earlier in the week when asked about his father and his mom’s plight – she is suffering from an undisclosed illness that kept her away from all but one game this season – moved him close to tears when quizzed post-game. \nIf Brady’s father is his hero, as he said, the women in his life are his rock. \nFive years earlier, when nursing the pain of defeat against the New York Giants in Indianapolis, it was Bundchen, the world’s highest-paid supermodel, who yelled at fans who blamed her husband for the loss as he departed the arena. \nThis time he would leave in far happier circumstances, and he was itching to get out of there. \n“I gotta go,” he said, as he walked into the locker room, after a quick post-game interview at a makeshift podium. \nBrady’s locker area is a peaceful spot, even amid the madness of a victory party. Other players don’t encroach on his space, everything is neat and tidy, a Hindu idol perched on the top shelf, his clothing hung with perfect above expensive leather bags. \nIt is an oasis of calm, until Brady turns up. Then the world’s media converge and the whole thing becomes mild chaos. \n“I’m done guys,” he said, putting his hands up to indicate he did not want to do any more interviews. The 39-year-old had said all there was to say anyway, with those laser throws and his vision and the incredible belief needed to chip away at a 25-point deficit. \nSeconds before James White crossed the goal line in overtime for the final and decisive score, Brady was still stalking the field, bristling with energy. When the moment of victory came it left him, nothing more in the tank. Brady simply stood, shaking his head, before being engulfed by his teammates. \nLater, despite his protestations, several reporters still wanted to talk to him and he was getting a little frustrated. He felt a tap on his hip and turned swiftly, annoyed for a second until he saw who it was. The tapper was Chris Hogan, the young wide receiver, who pulled in a series of key catches. \nBrady pulled him in for a gentle hug, \n“Way to go baby,” he said. “That was unreal.” \n“You’re the greatest,” said Hogan. \n“You are too baby. That was awesome. Right to the last whistle. Right to the last whistle.” \nIt was 10.23 p.m. CT when Brady started to peel off his cleats and socks, and by then he was angry. He had searched through all his bags, asked teammates and security staff and equipment managers, and he still couldn’t locate his game-worn jersey. \n“It was right here,” he said. “I know exactly where I put it. Not good. Not good.” \nHe wore a temporary scowl, and looked about as miserable as it is feasible for someone who has just masterminded the greatest comeback in football history to be. \nUntil Robert Kraft turned up. \nBrady has just grabbed his expensive leather bags and was making his way to the shower when Kraft, a foot shorter and 36 years older, made his way towards him. \nThe Patriots owner carried a box of cigars and was doling them out. He knew better than to offer Brady one, but instead threw his arms around his star player and pulled him close. \n“I love you man,” said Kraft, who has previously said he considers the quarterback to be like a son, before kissing him on the cheek. “I love you too,” Brady said, and did the same. \nAfter a quick shower Brady emerged and began to make his way clear of the locker room, where cheap champagne was being sprayed and plans for the party of all parties was being concocted, the defensive line being the primary ringleaders. \nYou can tell when Brady is on the move because stadium and team security staff spring into action, causing mild panic on occasions. \nAs for Brady, he was typically unflappable, clad in a cool gray suit, strolling toward the exit. The only time his facade cracked was when he was asked if the jersey had been found. \n“No,” he said. “It’s going to be on eBay soon, I guess.” \nAnd with that he was gone, out of the arena, onto a bus and away from the season that hurt him, tested him and will ultimately defined him. He will be back for more in a few months, he has made that clear already, with nothing left to prove, but plenty still to play for.
