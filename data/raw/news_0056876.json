And he's always been there for them.\" \nReferencing Bowie's 1971 song Kooks, which was written to him when he was a baby, Duncan added: \"So this award is for all the kooks and all the people who make the kooks.\" \nHall, who praised a man \"beholden to his own boundless imagination,\" quipped: \"If David Bowie could be here tonight, he probably wouldn't be here tonight.\" \nThe Brits also featured a tribute to George Michael, including a speech from Wham! star Andrew Ridgeley and their backing singers Pepsi and Shirlie. All three struggled to keep from crying as they spoke about what George meant to them. \nTo stimulate the tear ducts even further, Coldplay's Chris Martin capped it off with a performance of A Different Corner alongside clips of the late singer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:50:02.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
