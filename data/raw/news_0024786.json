A landmark court ruling in 2015 banned the caning of juvenile offenders by the courts, but the practice of caning persists in some schools. \nThe Sunday Mail reported in August 2015 that \"indiscipline\" had soared in schools where there was no more caning, and said they were becoming \"breeding grounds for rowdiness\". \nThere's been no comment from the Solusi High School over this latest incident. \nA headmistress in Epworth in Harare was charged with murder in early 2015 after a pupil died following a beating, the Herald reported then.
