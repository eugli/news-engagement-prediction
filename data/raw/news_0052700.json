The Nawab of Pataudi, who recently appeared on the producer-director’s talk show – ‘Koffee With Karan’ to promote his upcoming film ‘Rangoon’ – has put all rumours to rest. \nTalking about Sara’s launch, Saif said, “I would love Sara to be launched by Karan Johar. He is one of the best that we have.” \nKhan also rubbished rumours about his disapproval by saying, “I keep reading various reports where I am supposedly averse to her getting launched by Karan because she will apparently become another Alia Bhatt. If Sara becomes as successful as Alia is then it will be a matter of pride and happiness for all of us.” \nWell, it is also confirmed now that the young girl will be introduced to Bollywood by KJo. She was spotted posing with her mentor at Shahid Kapoor’s pre-birthday bash recently. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Tuesday, February 21, 2017 - 08:37 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:59:01.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
