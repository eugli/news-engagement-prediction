Photos \nSports Nuts: Famous Fans \nThe split appears nothing but amicable, though, as the source said, \"Alex and Anne have remained friends and will see each other as they move in a few shared social circles.\" \nWojcicki is the CEO and co-founder of billion-dollar personal genomics analytics start-up 23andMe, and the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin , whom she divorced in June 2015. \nRodriguez split with his ex, former professional wrestler Torrie Wilson, in 2015 after three years of dating. Over the years, Alex has also struck up romances with the likes of Madonna , Demi Moore , Cameron Diaz and Kate Hudson . \nIn August of last year, Rodriguez retired from the New York Yankees after a decades-spanning career in baseball.
