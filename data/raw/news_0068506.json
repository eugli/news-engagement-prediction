Instagram @ crossfitkrypton When Blake Milchuck hit the CrossFit gym this weekend, he tried something a little different. Blake and his wife, Kristin, are expecting a baby, and Blake was impressed that his wife could still break a sweat like the best of them— even 37 weeks pregnant . Blake wanted to see what that's like, so he strapped a 14-pound medicine ball to his chest to find out. The result: a video of Blake hilariously suffering through his typical workout with a \"baby\" along for the ride. Thankfully, CrossFit Krypton in Chesapeake, Virginia, shared the clip with the world. In the video, Blake starts with some push-ups , and it's clear he's struggling. He holds tight to the medicine ball while he gingerly leaps over a push-up bar. A person off-camera asks him how he's feeling, and he responds, \"It does not feel good.\" Meanwhile, in the background, (a very pregnant) Kristin can be seen working out on a rowing machine, making it look easy. Blake gets on the rowing machine next, and he's still struggling. He ends his workout on a stationary bike , holding onto his \"baby\" for dear life to keep it from getting in the way. The videographer points the camera at Kristin, saying, \"This is all because of you.\" To which Kristin perfectly responds, \"Or him!\" Related: 6 Tips for Exercising While Pregnant, From a Pregnant Celebrity Fitness Trainer The video is a hilarious role reversal, and it's a great reminder that pregnant women who hit the gym are strong as hell. As Blake learned, pregnancy can affect a woman's fitness performance. One particular change: balance. That extra weight in the front of the body can shift the body's center of gravity, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). That can make balancing during a workout tougher than usual. Also, let's not forget the host of other side effects of pregnancy —nausea, backaches, and swollen ankles, to name a few—that Blake didn't experience but a pregnant woman in the gym certainly could. According to ACOG, it's generally safe to exercise while pregnant, though you might have to slightly modify your workout routine. It's important to talk to your doctor and get her OK before exercising. The CDC recommends that pregnant women who are healthy—and have their doctor's OK—get at least 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week. Women who are already doing vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, like CrossFit, can typically continue doing so, as long as they discuss it with their doctor and make any necessary modifications. It's clear Blake is in awe of his amazing wife. He captioned the video of himself working out with the medicine ball, \"@kmilchuck is a badass and still hitting the gym—figured I could be a good sport and see whats it's like. #37week #14lbbaby #noteasy.\" Ladies, get you a man who can do both: CrossFit and CrossFit with a fake baby strapped to him.
