In 2010 the government agreed to pay them millions of pounds in compensation. Rhuhel Ahmed (left) and Shafiq Rasul in 2007. Photograph: Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/Getty Images The ‘Tipton three’ \nRhuhel Ahmed, Asif Iqbal and Shafiq Rasul were detained in Afghanistan in 2001 by a local warlord. The men, from Tipton in the West Midlands, were handed over to US forces before being sent to Guantánamo Bay. They were released from Guantánamo in 2004, together with Harith, and repatriated to the UK without charge. Tarek Dergoul \nA UK citizen of Moroccan origin, Dergoul was also released back to Britain in 2004 without charge, alongside Harith and the Tipton three. \nLast year the Sunday Times reported that Dergoul went to meet a Syrian terror suspect in the summer of 2011 in Portugal with Mohammed Emwazi, the notorious militant known as Jihadi John who was killed in a US drone strike in 2015. He told the paper that MI5 was aware of his relationship with Emwazi. \nThe Syrian they met in Portugal could not be named for legal reasons, but was reported also to have been detained in Guantánamo Bay . Speaking from his west London home, Dergoul told the Sunday Times: “We were in prison together. Of course I know this guy.” \nDergoul was picked up in Afghanistan in 2001 by local warlords who “sold” him to the US, he said. He became the first former captive to sue the UK government when he launched an action in 2007 over tactics used to gather intelligence. Ahmed Errachidi \nA Moroccan chef who spent much of his adult life in London, Errachidi was arrested in Pakistan and handed over to US authorities. After more than five years in Guantánamo, much of it in solitary confinement, he was released in 2007.

Omar’s other nephews Jaffar, 17, and Abdullah, 18, were both killed fighting in Syria. \nAmer cited Omar’s mistreatment in prison as having first planted doubts in his mind about life as a Muslim in the west. “The war on terror was obviously a war on Muslims, the Islamic way of life,” Amer told the Guardian last year . \nIn 2012, Omar told the Brighton Argus which had campaigned for his release, that he enjoyed living in Brighton .

In October 2014, he walked free from prison in the UK after seven terrorism-related charges connected to the conflict in Syria were dropped. Last month he wrote an article in Guardian condemning Donald Trump’s insistence that “torture works” . Binyam Mohamed \nA UK resident incarcerated in Guantánamo Bay for more than four years, Mohamed arrived back in the UK in February 2009 . He was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and secretly flown by the CIA to Morocco as part of an extraordinary rendition programme. He was subsequently flown to Afghanistan and then to Cuba.

The BBC reported that the government told him and another released Briton, Martin Mubenga, that they would not be allowed to have passports. \nHe was linked to the preacher Abu Hamza in court papers released before the latter’s trial in New York in 2014. Bisher al-Rawi \nAn Iraqi citizen and long-term British resident, Rawi was detained in the Gambia in November 2002 and later secretly flown by the CIA to Afghanistan. He joined a legal action in 2007 against the private US airline that transported him to Kabul. \n“I hope the lessons learned I will always have and I hope my ‘old me’ a big part of that, I can have back … but it takes a lot longer than I had thought,” he said in an interview with the Witness to Guantánamo project recently. “It has been over four years and I am just now feeling that I can sense that I am getting normal. Before, I could sense I am not normal.” Richard Dean Belmar \nLondoner Belmar was detained by Pakistani officials in 2002 and then moved to Guantánamo. He was released on 25 January 2005.

Like Abbasi, he was informed that he would not be issued with a UK passport. Ahmed Belbacha \nAn Algerian who moved to the UK and applied for asylum in 2003, Belbacha was granted exceptional leave to remain but had already been in Guantánamo for more than a year by that point, having been arrested in Pakistan during the final days of the Taliban regime. \nHe was first cleared for release in 2007 but had to wait until 2014 before being transferred to the custody of the government in his homeland Algeria. Abdenour Sameur \nAn Algerian army deserter who fled to Britain in 1999 after being ordered to fight against Islamists, Sameur was granted leave to remain in the UK. Sameur told US interrogators that a man he met at Finsbury Park mosque during the summer of 2001 gave him the money to travel to Afghanistan. \nHe was arrested in 2002 in the mountains between Pakistan and Afghanistan and shot in the leg attempting to escape. The Pakistani military handed handed him over to the US. He claims that he fled Jalalabad for the mountains of Tora Bora during the post-9/11 conflict, but maintains that he was attempting to escape the fighting, not take part in it. \nHe was released from Guantánamo in December 2007 along with Omar Deghayes and Jamil el-Banna.
