It was also alleged that actor Dhanush, being Soundarya's brother-in-law had rushed to the scene and persuaded the auto driver against filing a police complaint. However, all of the above seems to be misinformation circulated by someone. Dhanush was neither at scene, nor did such an accident even take place. The whole rumor is just a bad excuse for a joke. Dhanush, is currently at Madurai, where he was summoned by the Court in relation to the Paternity suite filed by an aged couple.
