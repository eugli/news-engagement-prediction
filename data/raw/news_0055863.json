allegations he gifted expensive presents to the leader's son Yair.\nLocal media also reports that Packer's lawyer asked Mr Netanyahu's Interior Minister whether it was possible for the Crown Casino owner citizenship in Israel.\nAlso present at the lunch was NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione, who recently announced his early retirement from the top job, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and Scott Morrison, Minister for Social Services.\nMr Turnbull praised the state of Israel as a 'modern miracle' and described it as the original start-up nation during the Israel-Australia business luncheon.\nHe said Jewish Australians played an important part in the development of Australia.\nMr Howard (left) and Israeli PM Benjamin 'Bibi' Netanyahu engage in conversation at a table\nMs

recent UN resolution condemning settlements and the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement, the latter of which he said Australia 'deplores'.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Mr Turnbull and Mr Netanyahu spoke extensively about national security matters, including cyber security during bilateral talks.\nMr Netanyahu thanked Mr Turnbull for the warm welcome as the first sitting Israeli prime minister to officially visit Australia.\n'The first thing I should say is G'day mate,' Mr Netanyahu told reporters.\nMr Netanyahu invited Mr Turnbull to visit Israel in late October to commemorate 100 years since the Battle of Beersheba.\nAustralia's 4th Light Horse Brigade were involved in a famous mounted charge.\n'You come as a great friend of our people and our civilisation,' Mr Netanyahu said.\nMr Netanyahu hit back at calls by former prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Bob Hawke for Labor to recognise a Palestinian state.\n'What kind of state will it be that they are advocating? A state that calls for Israel's destruction?\n'A state whose territory will be used immediately for radical Islam?'\nMr Netanyahu is the first Israeli prime minister to set foot on Australian soil\nMr Netanyahu takes a drink during the luncheon. Mr Turnbull told the crowd that Israel was 'the original start-up nation'\nMr Turnbull said Australia has always supported a two-state solution, where the Israeli and Palestinian people can live side-by-side.\n'It needs to be resolved by direct negotiations between the parties and we certainly encourage that,' he said.\n'We do not support one-sided resolutions which condemn or criticise Israel.'\nMr Netanyahu declined to give detailed comment on reports he is being investigated for allegedly accepting gifts from Australian billionaire James Packer.\n'I think nothing will come of it because there is nothing there, except friendship, which is a good thing.'\nWearing matching blue suits and ties, Malcolm Turnbull (left) greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) in Sydney on Wednesday for his four-day tour of Australia\nThe prime ministers (pictured) spoke extensively about national security matters, including cyber security, during bilateral talks in Sydney earlier on Wednesday\nMr Netanyahu invited Mr Turnbull to visit Israel in late October to commemorate 100 years since the Battle of Beersheba\nMr Netanyahu said he did not want to incorporate two million Palestinians as citizens of Israel nor did he want them to be the subject of Israel.\n'I want them to have all the freedoms to govern themselves but none of the powers to threaten us,' he said.\n'Let them govern themselves, but not have the the military and physical power to threaten the state of Israel.'\nHe said the settlements issue was 'way overblown'.\n'The core of the conflict between us and the Palestinians is their persistent refusal to recognise a Jewish state in any boundary,' he said.\n'And once they recognise a Jewish state, once they recognise the permanence of Israel and the right of Israel to be there as the nation state of the Jewish people, in our ancestral homeland ... everything else will fall in place.'\nReactions to Mr Natanyahu's visit will be mixed, with political and business leaders welcoming him with open arms amid protests by pro-Palestinian groups\nMr Netanyahu (second from left) and his wife Sara (second from right) walk with Mr Turnbull (left) and his wife Lucy (right) during their visit", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:49:21.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
