ANY women’s magazines or online gossip sites who buy these creepy pictures, had better be prepared for a fight.”\nSam posts a snap of the drone to her Insta. Source: Instagram \nThe angry TV presenter then signed off on the post with: “Fed up with this rubbish”.\nThe post immediately generated dozens of supportive replies.\n- russellmichelle@sam_armytage that is a disgrace! Agree, people need to boycott the trash mags. Love your work Sam.\n- mackeldenmattYou’re a country girl! Shoot the bastard thing out of the sky! #scumbags\nginnymaddiefireDisgusting...the laws need to change to protect peoples privacy..\n- traceylowe5I don’t buy them anymore it’s all garbage... We all need privacy no matter who we are... Hope the police help you out @sam_armytage\n- ezanorris They need to leave u alone its not right ... u need to get the police on .. @sam_armytage howz u cute puppy\n- mississippi33That is a horrible invasion of privacy!\n- Totally unacceptable @sam_armytage. You have a right to privacy in & on your property.\nfiona_in_avalonI’m so sorry this happens to you.\n- web_etchIt’s time to draw a big middle finger on your roof.\nSam had to get on social media to correct reports she was ‘flogging diet pills’. Source: Supplied \nIt was only last month the popular presenter spoke to the Daily Telegraph’s Stellar about the fascination the paparazzi has with her.\nNot even global superstars Hugh Jackman or Cate Blanchett are “papped” with the enthusiasm devoted to Armytage, a humble breakfast-TV host, Jordan Baker wrote.\nRumours about her love life and onset feuds can be found on gossip websites almost daily, and when no more mileage can be wrung out of those, paparazzi scratch around for something else — pictures of her preferred resort, close-ups of a mysterious new ring, and, most famously, a visible panty line.\nThen there were the reports Armytage was dating Stephen Symond, despite being gay and happily married. Source: Instagram Source: Instagram \n“I guess I am click bait, and that is not a great place to be,” Armytage, 40, said in January.\n“It has meant I have to readjust dramatically. It’s taken me a while to learn to deal with that and accept it. I still don’t enjoy it, but I accept it now.’’\nA series of articles and photographs of Armytage run by one media outlet back in December — and later dubbed undie-gate — was slammed by women as bullying.\nArmytage’s home in Bondi is constantly targeted by paparazzi. Picture: Toby Zerna Source: News Corp Australia \nDaily Mail Australia published paparazzi photographs of the television presenter out shopping in a white and black stripy dress, with the outline of her underwear faintly visible from behind.\n“Sunrise host Sam Armytage dares to bare with granny panties showing a visible line as she steps out in Sydney... after slamming rumours she’s dating Channel Seven colleagues,” read the headline.\nThe popular presenter then boldly announced she wanted loyalty ... so she bought a dog. Source: Supplied \nFurious women took to social media to attack the article as “callous, cruel and disgusting”, adding that the story amounted to stalking and cyber-bullying.\nUndie-gate came a day after the 40-year-old shared a post on Instagram expressing frustration over the gossip about her relationship status.\n“In the past week or so, I’ve been ‘in love with’ with; a gay colleague, a straight colleague, a bloke I stood next to at the races 3 months ago, a Gladiator, a British boy-band member & 17 other people I’ve never met,” she wrote.\n“I urge all of you half-sensible people out there not to read/buy this rubbish. And certainly not to believe it. Where’s the integrity in ‘journalism’ these days? If I stand next to someone, it DOES NOT MEAN I’M DATING THEM.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T11:49:53.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
