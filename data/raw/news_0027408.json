Image: Linear dunes, Namib Sand Sea December 9, 2016 \nAn astronaut aboard the International Space Station (ISS) used a long lens to document what crews have termed one of the most spectacular features of the planet: the dunes of the Namib Sand Sea. Image: Martian Morse code July 11, 2016 \nThis image of dark dunes on Mars was taken on Feb. 6, 2016, at 15:16 local Mars time by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. These dunes are influenced by local ... Image: Frosted dunes on Mars June 8, 2016 \nSand dunes cover much of this terrain, which has large boulders lying on flat areas between the dunes. Curiosity rover's sand-dune studies yield surprise July 1, 2016 \nSome of the wind-sculpted sand ripples on Mars are a type not seen on Earth, and their relationship to the thin Martian atmosphere today provides new clues about the atmosphere's history. Winds drive dune movement on Mars November 16, 2011 \nSand dunes, a common feature on the surface of Mars, can provide a record of recent and past changes. Some dunes near Mars polar areas have been observed to move recently due to carbon dioxide ice sublimation, but it ... Recommended for you Researchers pinpoint watery past on Mars February 15, 2017 \nResearchers from Trinity College Dublin have discovered a patch of land in an ancient valley on Mars that appears to have been flooded by water in the not-too-distant past. In doing so, they have pinpointed a prime target ... Scientists observe first planet-induced stellar pulsations February 14, 2017 \nFor the first time, astronomers from MIT and elsewhere have observed a star pulsing in response to its orbiting planet. Astronomers observe black hole producing cold, star-making fuel from hot plasma jets and bubbles February 14, 2017 \nThe Phoenix cluster is an enormous accumulation of about 1,000 galaxies, located 5.7 billion light years from Earth. At its center lies a massive galaxy, which appears to be spitting out stars at a rate of about 1,000 per ... Astronomers propose a cell phone search for galactic fast radio bursts February 14, 2017 \nFast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief spurts of radio emission, lasting just one-thousandth of a second, whose origins are mysterious. Fewer than two dozen have been identified in the past decade using giant radio telescopes ... No close partner for young, massive stars in Omega Nebula February 14, 2017 \nAstronomers from Leuven (Belgium) and Amsterdam (Netherlands) have discovered that massive stars in the star-forming region M17 (the Omega Nebula) are—against expectations—not part of a close binary. They have started ... Image: Rosetta's shadow crosses Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko in daring encounter February 14, 2017 \nValentine's Day 2015 and ESA's Rosetta swooped in towards Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko for a daring close encounter. At just 6 km from the surface, it was the closest the spacecraft had ever been to the comet at that ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:19:15.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
