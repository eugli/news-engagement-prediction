(Gene Kappock/New York Daily News)  03 PM \nThirty-two years after being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, Jean Ratelle's number will finally hang from the Garden ceiling next season as the Rangers announced the 76-year-old Ratelle's No. 19 will be retired. A date is not set as next season's schedule hasn't been confirmed. \nThe center on the famed GAG line between Rod Gilbert and Vic Hadfield, Ratelle played parts of 16 seasons with the Rangers until the blockbuster five-player trade on Nov. 7, 1975 that sent him and Brad Park to Boston with Phil Esposito heading to New York. \nRatelle is second in Rangers history with 336 goals, third with 481 assists, third with 817 points and sixth with 862 games played. He helped lead the Rangers to a Stanley Cup Final appearance in 1972, and appeared in two more Cup Finals with the Bruins. \nHe recorded the best points-per-game mark in Rangers history in that 1971-72 season at 1.73, recording 109 points (46 goals, 63 assists) in 63 games before suffering a broken ankle. His franchise record of 109 points stood until Jaromir Jagr's 123-point campaign in 2005-06. \nFollow the Daily News Sports on Facebook. \"Like\" us here. \nRatelle last month was named to the NHL's 100 Greatest NHL Players list, and during the celebration for the 100 greatest during All-Star weekend he wore that No. 19 Blueshirt, which after this season won't be worn again. \nThe No. 19 will join Eddie Giacomin’s No. 1; Brian Leetch’s No. 2; Harry Howell’s No. 3; Gilbert’s No. 7; Andy Bathgate and Adam Graves’ No. 9, Mark Messier’s No. 11 and Mike Richter’s No. 35 in the rafters.
