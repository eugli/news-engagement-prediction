Opinion 19 Feb 2017, 11:14 IST Saville hit the post with his effort early on \nChelsea were made to fight hard away from home at the Molineux to beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0 in their FA Cup 5 th round tie. Two goals in the second half from Pedro and Diego Costa sealed the win for Antonio Conte’s men after Wolves made the Premier League leaders battle for the win. \nChelsea’s Italian boss played a mixed lineup of fringe players and regular starters, who in the end came out on top in the second half after an average performance and a slight scare early on. \nHere are the player ratings: Wolverhampton Wanderers \nCarl Ikeme: 6/10 \nThe Wolves goalkeeper had a respectable game in goal with a number of saves. He came off his line to clear the danger on a number of occasions when Willian was through in the 12 th minute, Hazard in the 20 th minute, denied Diego Costa in the 30 th minute and Fabregas late on in the 80 th minute. \nHowever, he was rooted in the same spot for both Chelsea’s goals. \nDanny Batth : 5.5 /10 \nThe Wolves captain was engaged in a constant battle with Diego Costa the whole game and denied the striker in the 23 rd minute with a block while making important clearances in the 46 th and 53 rd minute. He finally went into the book for a foul on Costa in the 68 th minute shortly after Wolves conceded the first and could not clear for the 2 nd goal as well. \nKortney Hause: 6/10 \nHause lost his man Willian when the Brazilian went through in the 12 th minute but kept Moses in check to clear in the 60 th minute. Apart from that. he made critical interceptions and clearances for his side in the game. Unlike his captain and centre-back partner, he didn’t get booked and played with minimal fuss. \nMatt Doherty: 6/10 \nThe left back had a solid game for Wolves and minimised the danger of Victor Moses. The block he made on Moses’ cross in the 26 th minute was the highlight for the left back. However, he was extremely unlucky for the ricochet that went off his leg into the path of Diego Costa for Chelsea’s second goal. \nConor Coady: 7/10 \nCoady kept Eden Hazard quiet all night with his positioning and tenacity. The Wolves right back should be given credit for keeping the deadly Hazard in check for the majority of the game. He made a crucial block to deny Fabregas in the 85 th minute. Going forward he offered an option to his team-mates, but his crossing wasn’t the best. \nDavid Edwards: 6/10 \nDavid Edwards was full of physicality and energy in midfield and helped make things difficult for Chelsea and he even had a chance but headed wide in the 19 th minute. However, he made the crucial mistake of losing Pedro and allowing the Spaniard to run in behind him for Chelsea’s first goal. \nJack Price: 6.5/10 \nPrice combined well with Edwards and was the primary ball-winner for Wolves in the centre of the park. He won the ball back on numerous occasions but was let down by his team-mates after he passed it to them. \nGeorge Saville: 7/10 \nThe former Chelsea player had Wolves’ best chance of the game early on in the 5 th minute after a mistake by Kurt Zouma, but his left-foot shot hit the post. He should have scored that chance because there were barely any later on for his team. \nHe then went into the book in the 21 st minute for a clear foul on Willian after the Brazilian dribbled 40 yards with the ball. He was substituted in the 83rd minute. \nHelder Costa: 6/10 \nCosta had a few spells where he looked dangerous, but then faded as the game wore on. He had shot on goal in the 22 nd minute which was easily saved by Begovic. He put in a good cross in the 32 nd minute, but in general, his crossing wasn’t of the highest quality and Chelsea dealt with his threat well. \nAndreas Weimann: 6/10 \nWeimann played well defensively in handling Chelsea’s threat down the right by falling back to deny Moses, and even got booked for bringing down Willian in the 33 rd minute. But he should have finished off the rebound after Saville’s shot fell to him off the post. That could have been 1-0 to Wolves in the 5 th minute. \nJon Dadi Bodvarsson: 5/10 \nThe striker lead the Wolves front line but was completely nullified by the Chelsea defence. However, he did play to the best of his capabilities but lacked a finishing touch. \nSubstitutes \nDonavan Wilson: 4/10 \nWilson made his debut for Wolves after he came on for Saville in the 76 th minute but couldn’t create any chances for Wolves. \nRomain Saiss : NA \nSaiss came on for Bodvarsson in the 84 th minute but could do nothing in the 6 minutes plus added time. \nConor Ronan: NA \nRonan came on for Saville in the 84 th minute as well but had very little time to make an impact. Chelsea Pedro scored the vital opener for Chelsea \nAsmir Begovic: 6.5/10 \nBegovic was called into action early in the 2 nd minute when an over-hit cross almost crept in, but he tipped the ball over the bar. He made himself big to put off Wiemann’s follow up after Saville’s shot hit the post and then made a number of routine saves in the game to deny Wolves. He even juggled the ball to clear after a back pass and some miscommunication with Nathan Ake. \nKurt Zouma: 6/10 \nZouma didn’t have the best of games in the first half, especially after his poor clearance fell to Saville and then Wiemann. He was lucky that Saville only hit the post and the ball didn’t hit the back of the net. He played better in the second half, making a crucial clearance in the 47 th minute and even came forward to take a shot that went into the stands in the 58 th minute. \nJohn Terry: 6/10 \nIt was an average return for the long serving Chelsea captain in the heart of the Blues defence. However, his back line handled the pressure in the first half well enough to not concede. He made a good headed clearance in the 18 th minute and necessary interceptions. \nNathan Ake: 7/10 \nThe youngster justified his manager’s faith in him in this game with an assured performance. He was the stand-out Chelsea defender in the three-man back line and made a number of good headers and clearances particularly in the 50 th minute from Helder Costa. \nHe provided a glimpse of how important he can be for the club in the future after Conte called him back from his successful loan spell at Bournemouth. \nVictor Moses: 6/10 \nIt was a familiar game for Moses – solid at the back but lacking a quality final ball while attacking. The right back found himself in space on numerous occasions, including in the 26 th minute when Fabregas found him in acres of space but his cross was blocked. He similarly found space in the 46 th , 53 rd and 60 th minute but his delivery wasn’t the best. He must work on his crossing. \nNathaniel Chalobah: 6/10 \nThe young Chelsea player did very little in the game other than maintain solid positioning and support Fabregas in midfield defensively. However, it was necessary for his team. He had a shot in the 53 rd minute but apart from that was only playing his role. \nCesc Fabregas: 7/10 Fabregas dictated the tempo of the game with his short and long passing \nFabregas ran the show in midfield and bossed the game from the middle of the park. He put Willian through in the 12 th minute with a delightful lofted ball, released Hazard in the 16 th minute, and played another crossfield pass to release Moses in the 26 th minute. Later in the 80 th minute, he even found himself 1 v 1 against Ikeme but the Spaniard could not finish. \nHe also had one last chance to score in the 85 th minute but his shot was deflected away by Coady. \nPedro: 7/10 \nPedro is primarily a winger but was asked to play left-wing back by Antonio Conte for this game. Despite not being the best defensively he let very few crosses find their way in from his flank. \nHe was a bit wasteful going forward but made a superb run for his headed goal in the 65 th minute. The Spaniard ghosted in at the back post and finished superbly. It was the vital goal to break the deadlock and was important for Chelsea. Pedro has now scored in every round of the FA Cup. \nWillian: 7/10 \nWillian was a constant menace for Wolves and a threat down Chelsea’s right flank. He made a number of runs that drew fouls and cards. He probably should’ve scored after Fabregas’ ball found him through on goal, but Ikeme came out and thwarted his attempted lob. \nHis most telling contribution was the inch-perfect assist for Pedro’s goal in the 65 th minute. He found the Spaniard with a great cross that put Chelsea 1-0 up. \nEden Hazard: 4/10 \nThis was Eden Hazard’s worst game in a Chelsea shirt in recent memory. The Belgian was missing for large spells of the game and was kept quiet by Coady. He was involved in the build-up to Pedro’s goal and a chance for Fabregas in the 80 th minute but it was a poor showing from the winger. He needs to perform at a better level in the next game. \nDiego Costa: 7/10 \nDiego Costa battled the whole game up-front against the Wolves defence. He got into a number of tussles with Danny Bath but he could not score. However, in the end, the Spaniard persevered and scored a well-taken goal when the ball fell to him after a ricochet off Doherty in the 89 th minute. It was an instinctive finish after he reacted first and it left Ikeme stranded in goal. \nSubstitutes \nCesar Azpilicueta: 6/10 \nAzpilicueta came on in the 73 rd minute for Pedro and Chelsea looked much more solid from then on. \nN’Golo Kante: 6/10 \nKante came on for Willian in the 80 th minute and was involved in the build-up to Diego Costa’s goal. \nRuben Loftus-Cheek: N/A \nLoftus-Cheek was brought on in the 86 th for Eden Hazard but there was too little time for him to make a telling difference.
