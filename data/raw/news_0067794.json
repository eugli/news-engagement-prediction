Donovan speaks to media before an address at Bellarmine University. Donovan has… more Jessica Ebelhar/Bellarmine University Bellarmine University’s new president-designate Susan Donovan addressed local media and the campus just a day after she was announced the university’s new leader. “The mission of Bellarmine beckons us to unite to solve problems,” Donovan said. “While our tasks are not small and our challenges loom large, I pledge to you that we ... will continue to aspire to the highest level of excellence in the search for truth.” Susan M. Donovan speaks to media before an address at Bellarmine University. Donovan has… more Jessica Ebelhar/Bellarmine University Bellarmine announced Tuesday that Donovan would be the new university president, nearly a year to the day that former university president Joseph McGowan died unexpectedly at age 71 on March 1 of last year. Donovan, who will take over July 1, is the first woman to hold the president’s office. “I think it's time to break that glass ceiling,” Donovan said. “It doesn’t seem as though the community is going to have a tough adjustment to that.” Donovan, 58, currently works for Loyola University Maryland as an executive vice president. She has held numerous position in her 32 years at that school. In a conversation with local media before her address to the campus, Donovan said that she would be a collaborative leader who would empower decision-making at the “lowest levels possible.” “People running the programs probably know the most about the program,” Donovan said. “It’s not my job to intercede ... empowering people to do the jobs they were called to do is really important.” She also said that she will seek to diversify the faculty, staff and student body, calling it a passion of hers. According to the Bellarmine website, about 80 percent of the nearly 4,000 students attending the university — located in the Highlands between Norris Avenue and Newburg Road — are white and about 70 percent come from Kentucky. Donovan said a primary reason she decided to come to Bellarmine was because it was open to all races when it was founded 1950, calling Bellarmine radical and revolutionary for its openness then. “I think these are times where all of us need to really work together and hear each other from different perspectives,” Donovan said. She was selected from a pool of more than 200 candidates that the university’s presidential search committee considered, according to Bellarmine chairman board of trustees Patrick Mulloy . He also served on the presidential search committee. Also addressing faculty, staff and students gathered in the Amelia Brown Frazier Convocation Hall, Mulloy said: “There was a higher power at work with this committee because as you go through the balloting process and — without fail — by the end of the process we were unanimous.” The university winnowed the pool of applicants down from 200 to 20 and flew in only 11 for a lengthy interview process, Mulloy said. Donovan said she was offered the job last week. She said she will embrace the university’s aim to educate the whole student — providing for a student’s mind, body and spirit. Donovan said she is open to “modest” growth in the university’s athletic department if there is enough student interest to do so, saying it is a great way to unify students and alumni. She and her husband will move to the area, leaving the home only home her twin daughters have ever known, Donovan said. Her husband, Bill Donovan, is an associate professor of Latin American history at Loyola. Their daughters are sophomores in college. She is only the fourth president of the private catholic university since it's formation in 1950. McGowan was the longest-serving president, having taking the helm in 1990. The university’s board of trustees appointed executive vice president and provost Doris Tegart as interim president two weeks after McGowan passed away. Dr. Susan M.
