It is a powerful method of cleansing negative energy, clearing and balancing the chakras , effecting emotional release, and bringing light and healing into all the aura bodies. Cleared, programmed, and dedicated stones move the receiver's vibration into alignment with the planet and the universal grid. This results in a freeing of life force energy in the chakras and aura, a healing of the Body of Light, and a transformation of negative or dis-ease into health. Process of Laying On of Stones \nThe process may be done with clear quartz crystals only, colored gemstones only, or a combination of both. The stones may be used alone or with a hands on healing (ie; Reiki ). The stones are placed upon the receiver's body from feet to head. The healer then begins using her hands as usual starting at the head and moving toward the feet. (Use gemstones with colors matching each chakra's color. The stones can be in any form-faceted, raw gemstones, tumbled stones, crystal eggs , or crystal beads.) Energy in this type of healing needs to move in one direction through the body, either Earth to sky or sky to Earth. If the energy is Earth to sky, all the gemstones that have points are placed with the points turned towards the receiver¹s crown. The effect of this direction is to move the receiver's energy to a higher vibration or more spiritual level. If the direction is from sky to Earth, it is the opposite, with the crystals pointing toward the feet. This direction moves life force energy from crown to feet for grounding and rooting into Earth .To begin, the receiver lies on her back on a padded floor or massage table, with pillows under her head and knees for comfort. The space should be quiet, comfortable, and warm. Use only stones that have been dedicated to positive energy and programmed for healing (see: \nProgramming Gemstones and Crystals ).Invite spirit guides and angels into the session if you wish. \nStart by placing a clear quartz crystal above her head and below her feet. In the right hand place another crystal and in the left hand place a rose quartz gemstone. (my personal method). Then go chakra by chakra, moving from the feet to crown and placing the appropriate colored gemstone for each center (see: Gemstones Associated with the Chakras ). (Be sure you have your healing stones spread out where you can reach them easily.) There may be stones that you are drawn to for a particular reason, let yourself be guided, there are no real rules. You cannot do it wrong. A stone that is not needed for the session or is inappropriate for the receiver's energy will roll right off or roll to another place where it is better utilized. Allow this to occur. If the receiver feels uncomfortable with a particular stone, remove it, the energy is not right for her needs. \nWhen the stones are all in place, the healer has two options. She (he) can go to the head and begin a hands-on healing. Be sure to cover the stones with your hands carefully in order not to scatter the gemstones. While your hands are covering each chakra over the stone, visualize the bright color of the gemstone entering the chakra, making it appear bright, balanced, centered, and healthy. Do this visualization until you feel confident to move to the next chakra. Be sure to flick fingers to release any negative energy before going to the next center. End with a complete brushing of the aura.The other option a healer has once the stones are placed is to sit beside the receiver and simply wait, allowing the gemstones and spirit guides to do the healing. As the receiver¹s chakras and aura absorb and are balanced by the crystal and gem energies, the stones begin to roll off one by one. When all the stones are off, or the receiver feels finished with those that remain, the healing is over.End with a complete brushing of the aura and allow the receiver to lie quietly without the stones. Ask for feedback and discuss anything that you feel should be discussed. While she is doing this, the healer can gather up the stones from the table or floor and clear them again before putting them away. Put them into your protective box.A laying on of stones healing can be quite intense. There is often a major energy shift during this type of healing. More frequent emotional releases, past life and this life trauma openings and other transformative events. The healers role in this is to wait for the release to end and to be entirely non-judgmental. After a session, there may also be a physical detoxification process that can continue for up to a week. Be aware of what is happening and again, allow it. The changes are always positive and are usually gentle.
