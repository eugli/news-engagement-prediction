He then waited there hoping the U.S would accept him as a refugee.\nHe said he never even got to the interview stage.\nBy Feb. 19, 2017, Mohamed said couldn't wait any longer. Fear about getting sent to a detention center or deported became overwhelming. He made a seven-hour trip in waist-deep snow from North Dakota into Emerson.\n\"I feel bad that I didn't come here to begin with. I really do, because I wasted three years of my life,\" Mohamed said Sunday from the Salvation Army Booth Center.\nMohamed is one of 55 people who illegally crossed the border, now staying at the Salvation Army's Booth Centre. It has 400 beds in all and sees 350 people on an average cold night.\nREAD MORE: Despite Manitoba concerns, immigration minister not convinced of an asylum trend \nWith the surge in asylum seekers, the shelter is making sure no is turned away.\n\"The numbers are growing fast and we are being challenged by that,” said Major Rob Kerr. “We do have opportunities to move things around and make more space, but it's getting tight,\" he added.\n\nImmigration lawyer Bashir Khan \nImmigration lawyer Bashir Khan is busier than normal, too. He represents 37 refugee claimants who made the trek into Manitoba.\nOn Sunday, he said claimants can wait up to three months for a hearing on their case. If the claimant is accepted as a refugee at the hearing, they can apply for permanent residency.\nIf rejected, the claimant can appeal twice and could wait more than a year to learn if they'll get deported, but Khan said housing the claimants while they wait may not be necessary.\n\"I think half the people in Manitoba leave this province after 72 hours and are using the resources in Toronto and other places,\" Khan said.\nTo date, Khan said one of his clients who illegally crossed the border was refused refugee status. Three others have been accepted.\nREAD MORE: MPs visit Emerson as Public Safety Minister plans meeting with Homeland Security Secretary \nAbdulrahman Mohamed said he doesn't want to leave Manitoba and hopes to make the province his permanent home.\n\"I have a good feeling about this, I really do.
