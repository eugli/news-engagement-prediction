Kislyak. \nSavage noted that President Obama was caught on a hot mic telling outgoing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that Vladimir Putin should give him more “space” because Obama would have more “flexibility” to work with Russia after his re-election in 2012. \n“Was there an outcry by the Lilliputians in the media then?” Savage asked. \n“I see the demonization of Putin, Russia and Flynn as part of a campaign by neocons, the intel community and Democrats who want constant antagonism with Russia,” he said. \n“It’s like firemen who start fires to justify their jobs.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:58:39.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
