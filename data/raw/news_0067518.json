Brooke maintains he’s been completely loyal to her, and then adds, “Then again, so has your father.” \nMore: Dr. Phil features superhero costume-wearing moocher \nRidge arrives at the Forrester mansion, where Eric is out and Quinn worries that Ivy will come home. Ridge says it’s not such a bad thing – they needed a wake-up call. Quinn agrees it has to stop; they’re not even supposed to like each other. Ridge acknowledges the opposite sex appreciation they share. He asks, “Why did you kiss me?” Quinn theorizes about why she may have ‘served’ to him as she uses a tennis analogy. She suggests he go back to hating her. Ridge tells her to have a good day, and leaves. \nMore: Season Two airdate for Hallmark’s Chesapeake Shores revealed \nAt Spectra Fashions, Sally is down on her talent after the devastating review.

Sally muses, “Another door closes…and I wasn’t even knocking on it.” Shirley makes a speech about their heritage – couture knock-offs that look good after two or three washings. Saul wonders if she’s suggesting they commit corporate espionage. Shirley points out they already have an in with their rival – Thomas Forrester.

Suddenly, a girl arrives and happily greets Sally, who introduces her younger sister, Coco Spectra (Courtney Grosbeck) . Coco learns the preview was unsuccessful and wants to help. Shirley maintains they need to get back to their roots to solve the problem, and suggests Coco should become a spy at Forrester. \nThomas arrives at Forrester, where Steffy reads the scathing review Sally received in Eye on Fashion. Thomas testily remarks that it’s bitchy even for Jarrett. He admits he read it earlier and Steffy is taken aback when he refers to Sally as a competitor. Once alone, Thomas flashes to kissing Sally. Elsewhere, RJ talks to his mom about meeting the right girl for him some day – he’ll be committed to her the way Ridge is to Brooke. RJ asks if his mother thinks his dad will be a good husband, and that this time will be different. Brooke confirms she’s surer of Ridge than ever. Ridge arrives and has no objection to getting married in Australia. RJ expresses concern that these happy times will end, and they reassure him.
