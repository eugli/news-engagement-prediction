Myles Garrett (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:27 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:27 p.m. ET \nMyles Garrett really, really wants to play for the Cowboys as a rookie in 2017. \nESPN posted a video of the consensus No. 1 prospect from A&M sending a direct message to Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, asking him to trade up so Dallas can select him with the top overall pick. \nMORE: NFL Mock Draft \n\"I'm speaking to you Jerry,\" Garrett said. \"Make it happen. Dak Prescott is leading our team right now. I need you to take Tony Romo, take a couple picks, and give them to Cleveland so you can pick me up. Please. I'd love to play in Dallas — just make it happen.\" \nMORE: Romo situation isn't complicated if Cowboys treat him fairly \nGarrett must be more opposed to playing in that Cleveland weather than he previously let on. Still, he isn't the only high-profile prospect who said he wanted to play for Dallas: Current NFL rushing leader Ezekiel Elliott asked for the same thing ahead of the 2016 draft. \nThere's a precedent Dallas could follow if it thinks Garrett is worth trading up for. In the last draft, the Browns traded the No. 2 overall pick to the Eagles for the the No. 8 pick overall pick, a third-round pick and a fourth-round pick, plus a first-round pick in 2017 and second-round pick in 2018. \nQuestion is, are the Cowboys willing to give up that much in return? Dallas ranked 13th in the NFL with 36 sacks last season, so anything's possible.
