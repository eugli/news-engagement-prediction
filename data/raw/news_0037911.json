CLAP FOR THEM?   Thu, 16/02/2017 - 9:30am \nDear A.S.S. Editor \nNParks late have kept repeating and reiterating that their tree inspections is all good, and in line with the global standard. Advertisement \nIs anyone disputing that? Why must always say they are the best in this, or first in the world in something? Just say and admit that no matter how hard they work in ensuring trees are ok in Singapore, sometimes nature conspires to do something that we cannot prepare for. The death of a woman at Botanic Gardens and the injuries to others in the same incident and the one at Yuan Ching Road are tragedies nobody wanted to happen. \nSo stop trying to look all good and say they have followed procedures, the inspection of trees are world standard, and basically trying to cover their ass. Just say sorry, we have done our best, but accidents do happen. We will try even harder to prevent accidents happening next time. \nSo hard to say that, ah? \nSean Tay \nA.S.S.
