On Twitter, Lana urged the witchcraft to start at the stroke of midnight during four days exactly at midnight — on February 24, March 26, April 24, and May 23. Those days are close to some days that have a “new moon” in 2017, not a “full moon,” which is often associated with witchcraft. However, the “ new moon ” is one that has been reserved for plenty of religious festivals or practices since biblical days, as reported by Bible Hub . [Image by Jim Ross/AP Images] \nAs reported by Page Six , although Lana wrote that the “ingredients can [be] found online” for the witchcraft ceremony — which are said to include certain things like a Tarot card and President Trump’s photo — the publication points to the witchcraft Facebook group at the center of the ceremony claiming that the witchcraft isn’t designed to hurt Mr. Trump. Instead of likening the February 24th witchcraft ritual to using a voodoo doll, the claims of the Facebook witchcraft group entail simply stopping Mr. Trump from a destructive path by allegedly knocking him off of his presidential throne, as it were. \nHowever, in spite of the planned witchcraft ceremonial urgings against President Trump, there’s a backlash rising from people who may or may not be Trump supporters — but are making it clear that they don’t plan to use witchcraft to defy Mr. Trump. As seen in the below GIF posted as a reply to Lana from Twitter user @huntyboots, some are declaring in response to Del Ray, “I don’t play with demons.” \n— ???? of horace (@huntyboots) February 24, 2017 \nOthers are addressing the issues with prayers, like Facebook user Kim Johnson , who went live on Facebook in a video titled, “ Coffee with Kim: Show down between witches and Trump?” The video has gotten hundreds of views, and is rife with comments from commentators who are writing about praying against the planned witchcraft ceremony. \nAs noted by Bible Hub , Scripture has called “rebellion is as sinful as witchcraft” and witchcraft and magic spells were spoken of being destroyed in negative terms throughout plenty of passages . \nA search for “witchcraft Donald Trump” on Facebook turns up a variety of responses regarding the planned event, which invited not just female witches but men and all versions of various witchcraft practitioners to join the spirit of “binding” Mr. Trump. \nHowever, Facebook users like Valeria Jayne Mann McMahan posted a prayer urging Christians to pray for President Trump in the midst of the witchcraft melee. McMahan turned to biblical mandates in urging Christians to pray for earthly leaders. \n“Dear Christian Friends, How much do you pray for our elected officials? That’s a rhetorical question. You don’t need to answer me that. But I do think that each of us should individually answer it for ourselves. Paul wrote to Timothy – and I believe for our instruction and benefit, ‘…I urge that entreaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men, for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.’ ( 1 Timothy 2:1-4, NASB )” \nMcMahan called the witchcraft ceremonies an attempt to cast a “mass spell” on Mr. Trump and the Trump administration — with McMahan noting that as a Christian, she also prayed for President Obama when he was in office.
