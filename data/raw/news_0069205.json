It can be reprofiled in the future, he added.\n\"The Treasury Board identifies amounts that they don't want the departments to spend or they're sure that they're not going to spend,\" Askari said.\n\"A big chunk of it is because of infrastructure. ... Obviously, they haven't been able to get all the money out and get all the infrastructure programs running.\"\nImpact on economic growth unclear \nAskari said it's common for allotments to be frozen when it comes to federal departments that are involved in a lot of capital spending — like Infrastructure, Defence, Fisheries and Oceans and Indian and Northern Affairs.\n\"Parliamentarians may wish to inquire about the reasons why specific allotments have been frozen, which programs or projects have been affected and what delays in program implementation have led to the reprofiling of funds,\" the budget office report said.\nOn infrastructure, the budget watchdog released a report this month that said departments had only identified $4.6 billion worth of projects out of the $13.6 billion in infrastructure money announced in last year's budget. That total was slated to be spent through March 2018.\nThe budget watchdog warned of \"a significant gap\" in meeting that target.\nQuestions have also been raised on how spending delays could weaken Ottawa's economic growth projection for 2016-17. The federal prediction includes an anticipated boost in growth from the promised infrastructure investments.\nIn response, Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Ottawa was confident cities and provinces would complete projects by the end of next March, with the exception of a few whose funding flows into 2019 and beyond.\nSohi said the feds have pressed provincial officials to finalize the list of projects they want funded. Federal officials have been examining project proposals with the expectation Ottawa will approve them for funding over the coming months.\nLooking at the overall number in Thursday's budget office report, Askari said due to many offsetting factors it's unclear how the $3 billion in unspent money this year could affect the government's 2016-17 bottom line.\nLast fall, the Trudeau government projected a deficit of $25.1 billion for this year.\nEarlier this month, the budget office predicted Ottawa was on track for a shortfall of $20.5 billion, thanks in part to its estimate that program expenses would be $1 billion lower than the government expected.\n© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:24:08.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
