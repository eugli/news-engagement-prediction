This is fine beyond the fact that I had to go to Dudley, the greyest and most rotten town I ever have seen and the trip went off mostly without a hitch *1. But a week or so before it, she said something to me, the university girlfriend, in a low and warning voice: \"He my dad thinks handshakes are important.\" And so it was explained to me: her dad, a perfectly round bald man who bought a new TV every year and a new car every three and read The Sun and once drove me two-and-a-half hours home so he could explain to me why plans for the new mosque were bad her dad was going to judge everything about me based on the strength and dominance of my opening handshake. He was planning this. He was going to dad me out of town.\nThis, if you've ever met a girlfriend's dad, is de rigeuer : dads, their dominance and testosterone fading, just on the cusp of realising their generation is no longer the active one, ballooning around the waists, no longer vital or attractive, the dads, hairlines receding to their backs: dads don't have a lot of power left. But they can exert it in some little way, and every chance they get to, they will. They can put importance on a handshake, like it matters.\nSo what I did was: I read a couple of GQ articles online about how to shake a hand, practised on a few mates over the course of a weekand then, on the day, I hit him with the sucker: right foot striding forward, firm-yet-balanced grip, two pumps up and down, consistent eye contact, break. An immaculate handshake. The perfect handshake. Great handshake. Enormous. Huge.\nRelated: what the clean fuck is this?\nFirst second of this is like: \"You are going to have to pick up a lot of the slack of this handshake, my friend, because I have arms short and tiny like a Tyrannosaurus\";\nSecond move is kind of I mean,he is patting him like you would a good boy, a good dog boy, just a good dog boy who, sadly, you have to put down.This is goodbye, boy, I love you;\nThen the third section of the shake is like: \"This is my arm. I want it. This is my arm , now. Donald Trump. Three arms.\"\nImean, handshakes aren't important we've established that. But then this isn't a handshake; it's essentially the movement of a dog yanking a bone that is still attached to something heavy, only transposed onto the human arm of the most powerful man alive. If I can learn how to handshake and, as we have established many, many times over, I am essentially an idiot; if adulthood still adhered to the \"Year\"system of schools then I would be held many times back then why can't Trump? \nAs Mashable points out, Trump has form for this: beyond the \"you have an arm and I want it\"yank-and-pull method (often described as a \"power play\" by psychologists), he also did this zany shit in the first series of The Apprentice :\nAnd this just absolutely mad crap:\nThis all, of course, adheres to the wider theory that Trump is not a human, but rather a BP Richfield-shaped robot designed during WWII by the bad guys. The robot, in its age, is malfunctioning: the human tics and intricacies that made it \"pass\"for so long are starting to wear. I know I just made this up, but I think it has legs Trump's body definitely is the size and has thebox-like shape to contain robotic parts and engines instead of organs; the hair definitely looks like something someone found in one of those \"walled up roomthat hasn't been touched since 1945\"things that happensometimes.Also, the fascism. If a Subreddit could take the rest of the work on this one and incontrovertibly prove it then I really would appreciate the help.\nAnyway, to recap: the President of the United States cannot neatly execute the same simple human function that you perform when you agree an overdraft extension with the bank, or thank the bossman for extra chips, or greet literally any human male in the pub of their choosing. Does that fill you with a smalldarkfeeling of dread? That fills me with a small dark feeling of dread. Here's to the next four years.\nRELATED READING: [ wikiHow How to Shake Hands ]\n@joelgolby \nMore stuff from VICE: \nPsychologists Explain Why People Keep Having Trump Nightmares \nWho Made the Best Brexit Speech as Parliament Voted for Article 50? \nWhat It's Like to Grow Up as an Unwelcome Immigrant", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T16:06:30.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
