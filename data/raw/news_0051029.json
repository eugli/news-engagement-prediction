Realising what had happened, the police officer gives chase \nHe dropped the bag and ran off. \nA video, posted online, shows the bizarre encounter which occurred in Grosvenor Gardens. \nIn it, a squatter claims the “factory” was discovered by activists from the Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians, who are living in a seven-storey property opposite. \nThe cameraman says: “ANAL have located a £500,000 cannabis grow...They (police) are removing the weed and equipment right now.” \nAs they approach the building, one of the squatters tries to engage two police officers guarding the van of the beneficial properties of hemp, before the group moves to the front door saying “shall we go and see what’s inside?” A confrontation ensued after the incident near Buckingham Palace \nAs soon as they get to the entrance, the squatter emerges with the bag, as the cameraman says: “Oh, ho, what do we have here? Just run. run, run. \n“Oh, it’s all going down, oh sh*t!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T14:53:50.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
