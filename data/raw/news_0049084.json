L’Jean McKneely said.\n“I could see in his eyes he needed help,” Williams-Tillman, 56, said of the officer. “You don’t have time to think about it … I did what God needed me to do.”\nShortly after the good Samaritan jumped on Bennett’s back to pull him off the 44-year-old officer, law enforcement backup arrived and the suspect was apprehended after being shot with a stun gun.\nBaton Rouge Mayor-President Sharon Weston-Broome said Williams-Tillman was a courageous hero.\n“Vickie Williams-Tillman epitomizes the true Good Samaritan,” Weston-Broom said. “She reached out and offered a courageous and unconditional response to the officer. Ms. Williams-Tillman is a hero and demonstrates the true meaning of loving God and loving your neighbor.”\nWilliams-Tillman said there was no doubt in her mind that she needed to help the struggling cop. She described it as “something that went through my soul,” adding, “You don’t think about the risk.”\nBennett was arrested on charges of aggravated battery, disarming a police officer, battery on a police officer, resisting an officer with violence and possession of cocaine and possession of drug paraphernalia.\nThe officer sustained a few wounds to his head and Williams-Tillman injured her wrist. After being treated, The Advocate reported, Williams-Tillman and the police officer shared a hug at the hospital.\n“A lot of people passed him up,” Williams-Tillman said of when she saw the officer in need. “They’re human beings, just like us … We’re all one family.”\nOne other Baton Rouge officer shared a photo of Williams-Tillman (right), thanking her for her heroic act of kindness.\n\nThis incident follows a deadly attack on police officers in July of last year. In an ambush-style assault , a Missouri man fatally shot three police officers and wounded three others.\nIt is unclear at this point if Bennett’s attack was sparked by an anti-police sentiment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:34:16.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
