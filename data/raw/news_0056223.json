Manslaughter: Trevor Timon will be sentenced on Friday (Metropolitan police) \nThere were gasps in court as the verdict was read out and Mr Dearlove's girlfriend Claire Wheatley appeared shaken and upset. \nAfterwards the victim's mother, Joy Wright, praised personal trainer Matt Whitmore and his girlfriend Keris Marsden, who came to her son's aid as he lay stricken on the pavement. \nMrs Wright said: \"The actions of others have been remarkable; the young couple that came to Oli's aid and gave him CPR, which enabled us to say goodbye to him whilst he was warm and breathing, all be it on life support machine. \n\"Also the support they gave Oli's friends with their trauma. Young banker: Mr Dearlove died in hospital the day after he was punched (Metropolitan police) \n\"But the difference being, the four young mothers who walked away and left him lying on the pavement, one of them saying in the witness box under oath that she saw Oli being given CPR, but didn't think it was that serious.\" \nMrs Wright said the loss of her \"confident, friendly, non-confrontational\" son had left a \"gaping hole\" in the family and robbed him of \"an amazing and fulfilled future\". \nShe said: \"He was planning a life with his girlfriend Claire, which has been cruelly halted; no-one has the right to take another's life and for no reason at all. \n\"Regardless of the sentence Timon receives, nothing will bring our Oli back. We have endured the worst time of our lives in the past seven months including sitting through a trial reliving Oli's last moments. His autopsy report was horrendous for us all.” Oliver Dearlove : Timon punched the banker after an altercation with friends (Metropolitan police) \nMr Dearlove, of New Eltham, worked as a relationship manager at Duncan Lawrie Private Bank, having previously held a position at Coutts, the bank used by the Queen. \nOn August 27 last year he had been eating and drinking with old Portsmouth University friends in Blackheath, south-east London. \nAt about half past midnight, they left Zerodegrees microbrewery and walked past Mordens nightclub where Timon had bought champagne for a group of women at a birthday party. \nTimon and the women walked along Tranquil Vale to get a cab home when they came across Mr Dearlove and two friends. Devastating loss: Oliver Dearlove with girlfriend Claire Wheatley \nThe court heard different accounts from Timon, the four women, who could not be named for legal reasons, and Mr Dearlove's friends on how the violence erupted. \nOne of the women described having a friendly chat with Mr Dearlove after she took off her new high heels to nurse her sore feet. \nMr Dearlove was \"polite\" as he admired her baby pictures, before Timon demanded to know what they were talking about. \nShe said: \"I showed him a picture and he said 'oh wow he's really beautiful'. To myself he was perfectly fine, just polite. Planning to start a family: Oliver Dearlove and girlfriend Claire Wheatley \n\"Trevor was walking towards us, then there was an exchange of words. Trevor said something like 'what are you saying, what's going on' to me or Oliver. It was not the friendliest but it was not overly horrible.\" Man who killed banker with a single punch cleared of murder \nMr Dearlove's friend Andrew Cook said Timon was angry and came out of nowhere with \"bad intentions\". \nHe said: \"He was looking for a fight. Not a nice guy. We didn't know why, it all happened so quickly.\" \nGiving evidence, Timon admitted telling the victim \"'if you don't get out of my face I will knock you out\" but said it was just a \"figure of speech\". \nThe defendant, who is mixed race, said he was upset when one of the victim's friends laughed and called him a \"half chap\". \nAfterwards, Timon fled to Ireland to see his mother and sent a series of messages to a close female friend apologising for what happened before handing himself in to police. \nIn the absence of the jury, defence barrister Courtenay Griffiths QC tried to block details about Timon's violent past from being aired in court. \nBut prosecutor Anthony Orchard QC successfully argued that Timon's evidence gave an impression which was at odds with his previous behaviour. \nIn February 2008, when he was 22, Timon angrily shouted at a bus driver, brandishing a golf club. \nIn January 2010, he shouted and swore saying he would \"start f fighting\" while being restrained by his uncle. \nOn May 26 2010, Timon was verbally abusive towards a woman he knew and took issue with her talking to another man. \nWhen she said she was talking to her friend, he responded: \"No he's not, I'm going to bang you out\" before punching her in the face. \nJurors were told Timon admitted battery, an offence which does not mean he intended to cause harm. \nIn July 2011, Timon tried to punch a barman after being refused re-entry to a pub after closing time, but the blow failed to connect. \nSentencing was adjourned until Friday morning.
