The company unveiled its proven technology including MIRA , a mobile application that improves EHR usability and performance, and SIYA , a care management workflow solution for payers, providers, and patients. \n\nThe company also announced today that Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami, FL, recently implemented Praxify’s technology to streamline clinical workflows and provide its physicians with deep clinical insights at the point of care. In a preliminary study, physicians at Nicklaus who used Praxify's MIRA technology for the first time improved their documentation and order creation speed by 30% over their existing processes. \n“It is no secret that physicians today have ’point and click fatigue’ when it comes to the EHR, leading to higher rates of physician burnout, lower physician productivity, and most importantly, lower patient satisfaction,” said Ram Sahasranam, President and Co-Founder of Praxify. “Our company has developed proven technologies that help EHRs work the way they should: to enhance the patient-provider encounter, streamline workflows and enable physicians to consume clinical insights.” \nPraxify’s core application, MIRA, adds a mobile-based augmentation layer to an organization’s existing EHR, making it much faster and easier for physicians to use. Specifically, MIRA speeds up and improves the chart review process by collecting, analyzing, and displaying relevant patient data in a ‘glance-able’ interface. MIRA also helps physicians complete documentation and orders faster with a voice-activated digital assistant and context-aware, adaptable templates. In addition, as an Apple mobility partner, Praxify has worked closely with Apple to optimize product design for a physician’s mobile workflow. \nLooking for a solution that would enhance the capabilities of the organization’s EHR, Nicklaus Children’s Hospital collaborated with Praxify to help physicians access clinical documents and comprehensive clinical insights on the go. \n“Praxify’s solutions are enabling Nicklaus Children's Hospital to leverage our existing EHR infrastructure, while significantly streamlining clinical workflows and bringing real-time analytical feedback to the provider at the point of care,” said Edward Martinez, CIO & SVP IT of Miami Children’s Health System. “This partnership is helping us allow our clinicians to work the way they want to, with less time spent clicking through tabs in the EHR and more time interacting with patients. Their communications tools also help outcomes and patient experience simultaneously.” \n“Providers are often frustrated with going through all of the screens and filling out all the forms required in the EHR. As we seek to gather and utilize population health data, we want to be sure not to exacerbate clinicians’ stress,” said Dr. Jacques Orces, CMIO, Nicklaus Children's Hospital. “MIRA makes the EHR easier to use while also bringing in additional data points from its own analytic engine. It has been a great fit for our organization.” \n“The most important thing about technology is that it should solve a problem – if using the technology creates challenges for the user, the goal is not achieved. Nowhere is this idea more important than in healthcare,” said Dr. Narendra Kini, CEO of Miami Children’s Health System. “Praxify has built a platform that emulates clinical workflows, and an environment that makes users feel like nothing has changed. With clinical intelligence built into the product, the technology provides smart guidance which differentiates Praxify’s solutions from any other technology in the marketplace today.” \nTo learn more about Praxify, stop by booth #1689 at HIMSS from February 20-23 in Orlando, or visit http://praxify.com .
