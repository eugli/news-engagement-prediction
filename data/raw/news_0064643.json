Source: AP \nBut Tottenham suffered another blow four minutes before half-time when Alli, frustrated seconds earlier when a challenge on him wasn’t given as a foul, launched into a horrific two-footed lunge on Brecht Dejaegere, drawing an instant red card. \nDespite their numerical disadvantage, Tottenham regained the lead in the 61st minute. \nWalker looked to exchange passes with Eriksen on the edge of the box, but Kenya midfielder Wanyama latched onto it and scored with a powerful strike. \nIt was a false dawn however as a woeful blunder from Eric Dier ended Tottenham’s European campaign in the 82nd minute. \nWhen Kalifa Coulibaly lofted over a cross, Dier should have dealt with it, but instead he chested carelessly down for French striker Perbet to prod the decisive finish past Lloris. \nEuropa League round of 32 second leg results on Thursday: \nOsmanlispor (TUR) 0 Olympiakos (GRE) 3 (Ansarifard 47, 86, Elyounoussi 70) Olympiakos go through 3-0 on aggregate \nAjax (NED) 1 ((Viergever 49) Legia Warsaw (POL) 0 Ajax go through 1-0 on aggregate \nAPOEL (CYP) 2 (Sotiriou 46, Gianniotas 54-pen) Athletic Bilbao (ESP) 0 APOEL go through 4-3 on aggregate \nZenit Saint Petersburg (RUS) 3 (Giuliano 24, 78, Dzyuba 72) Anderlecht (BEL) 1 (Thelin 90) Aggregate 3-3 - Anderlecht go through on away goals \nRoma (ITA) 0 Villarreal (ESP) 1 (Borré Amaury 16) Roma go through 4-1 on aggregate \nBesiktas (TUR) 2 (Aboubakar 17, Tosun 87) Hapoel Beer-Sheva (ISR) 1 (Nwakaeme 64) Besiktas go through lead 5-2 \nFiorentina (ITA) 2 (Kalinic 15, Borja Valero 29) Borussia Moenchengladbach (GER) 4 (Stindl 44-pen, 47, 55, Christensen 60) Moenchengladbach go through 4-3 on aggregate \nSparta Prague (CZE) 1 (Karavaev 84) Rostov (RUS) 1 (Poloz 13) Rostov go through 5-1 on aggregate \nTottenham Hotspur (ENG) 2 (Eriksen 10, Wanyama 61) Gent (BEL) 2 (Kane 20-o.g., Perbet 82) Gent go through 3-2 on aggregate \nCopenhagen (DEN) 0 Ludogorets (BUL) 0 Copenhagen go through 2-1 on aggregate \nGenk (BEL) 1 (Pozuelo 67) Astra Giurgiu (ROM) 0 Genk go through 3-2 on aggregate \nLyon (FRA) 7 (Fekir 5, 27, 78, Cornet 17, Darder 34, Aouar 87, Diakhaby 89) AZ Alkmaar (NED) 1 (García 26) Lyon go through 11-2 on aggregate \nPlaying later Shakhtar Donetsk (UKR) v Celta Vigo (ESP) (Shakhtar lead 1-0)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:46:07.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
