There was a newspaper inside. Most of it was damaged, but some parts you could still read.' The newspaper found inside was The Methodist - a weekly news and review sheet from Friday, June 4, 1880 and priced 1d. This paper from 1880 was also discovered inside the 'time capsule' in Somerset A letter from 1984 to the Congregations of Wesleyan Methodists was also discovered The papers were stuffed inside this glass jar which was cut inside the slab of rock The bottle also contained papers relating to the South Petherton circuit of the Weslyan Methodist Church. 'It would have been tricky to have done this at the time,' added James. 'We have new tools, but back then they would have had to cut it out and carve it simply with a steel chisel. We now have saws.' The golden coloured stone - quarried at Ham Hill, Somerset - is used for many buildings, including medieval churches in the area. Mr Whiting said he is considering replacing the bottle and putting the stone back together the way he found it - possibly with the addition of contemporary newspaper. He said: 'It would be a surprise for someone else to come across, maybe in another 150 years' time.' Bosses at Castle Reclamation say they are considering putting the artefacts on display. Director Adrian Wills, 59, said: 'It's just a shame we cannot find out where it came from. We bought the stone three to fours years ago from a builder's yard.' The exact source of the Hamstone - also known as Jurassic limestone - is uncertain, but it is believed to have come in from a local builder's yard. The time capsule was found inside a special hollowed-out section of the piece of Hamstone Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:52:56.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
