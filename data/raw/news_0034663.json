Share via Twitter NBC / Getty Images Robert De Niro and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. held a joint press conference on Wednesday, and they offered $100,000 to anyone who can provide proof that vaccines are safe—despite scientific evidence that says just that. “On one hand, the government is telling pregnant women which mercury-laced fish to avoid so that they don’t harm their fetuses, and on the other, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supports injecting mercury-containing vaccines into pregnant women, infants, and children,” Kennedy said, per the New York Daily News . “This defies all logic and common sense.” That might sound alarming, but the truth is that many major health organizations, including the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Academy of Medicine, and the World Health Organization, have repeatedly said that there is no connection between vaccinations and autism or other neurological conditions. Numerous studies have also backed up those statements. De Niro didn't speak much but did say this, per the Huffington Post : \"I’m glad I’m here. I thought what Bobby said was great. It was eloquent. I couldn’t have said it better myself. I agree with him 100 percent. Thank you.\" Kennedy has repeatedly expressed concerns that vaccines cause autism, which science has shown is not the case. He also claims that the government is covering this up, an allegation he made in a 2005 article for Rolling Stone called “Deadly Immunity.” Kennedy wrote on the topic again in a 2014 book called Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak and later promoted the 2014 antivaccination movie Trace Amounts . Kennedy also made headlines in early January after he met with President-elect Donald Trump about the possibility of chairing a committee on vaccine safety . De Niro and Kennedy specifically cited the use of thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative used in some vaccines. However, the FDA has found that thimerosal poses no harm to people. The organization also has extensive information on the preservative and scientifically backed information on the safety of its use on its website . Before it was determined that thimerosal is not harmful, it was removed as an ingredient from many vaccines as a precaution. However, after research failed to link it with health problems, it is still in some flu vaccines, the CDC says. Despite that, De Niro, who has a son with autism , and Kennedy are offering $100,000 through Kennedy’s World Mercury Project to anyone “who can find a peer-reviewed scientific study demonstrating that thimerosal is safe in the amounts contained in vaccines currently being administered to American children and pregnant women,” per the Daily News . Richard Watkins, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and associate professor of internal medicine at Northeast Ohio Medical University, tells SELF that the proposal is “absurd.” “Vaccines have been proven safe in numerous studies,” he says. “The belief that vaccines are unsafe and not effective in preventing infections is not based on scientific evidence or reality.” Kennedy’s comments are “very dangerous, not supported by science, and continue to perpetuate long disproven myths about vaccines,” Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a board-certified infectious disease physician and affiliated scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells SELF. He also quickly presented a link to a 2003 study of nearly 500,000 children published in JAMA that found no link between autism and vaccines that contain thimerosal. “The results do not support a causal relationship between childhood vaccination with thimerosal-containing vaccines and development of autistic-spectrum disorders,” researchers concluded in the study. Kennedy is right in that pregnant women are encouraged to avoid fish that contain high levels of mercury, but William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious-disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells SELF that’s a completely different form of mercury than thimerosal. There are two chemical forms of mercury, he explains: Methylmercury, which is not found in vaccines but is found in fish , and ethylmercury, which “is basically thimerosal.” Methylmercury can build up in your body, but ethylmercury does not, Dr. Adalja says. The CDC also notes that the human body easily eliminates thimerosal from its system, adding, “thimerosal use in medical products has a record of being very safe.” Watkins calls vaccines “a miracle of modern medicine” and says parents should vaccinate their children . “I have vaccinated all of my children and recommend that other parents do so without any hesitation,” he says. “I have seen the effects of vaccine-preventable infections, including measles , which can cause permanent brain damage, and mumps , which can cause sterility. Parents should be worried about that and not vaccines.” If you still have concerns about vaccines, experts say it’s important to talk to your child’s pediatrician. “Talk to your doctor, your pediatrician,” Dr. Schaffner says. “They’re there to take care of your children, day in and day out. Trust your doctor—they will guide you well.” Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:32:22.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
