(Many nebulae are given playful names, after what they seem to resemble.)\n\nBoth of these objects were discovered in 1837 by famed astronomer John Herschel while he was in the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. Of course, he didn't have the luxury of the 256-megapixel camera used to obtain this image. \nThe bright areas in both nebulae are gaseous regions containing mostly hydrogen energized by bright, newborn stars that are about 10 times more massive than our own sun. The ultraviolet light ionizes the hydrogen atoms, and allows us to see the beautiful tendrils of gas weaving through space.\nWhile the image above is beautiful, you can see a larger version here where you can zoom in and lose yourself in the region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:44:44.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
