The cause of the fire is not yet known. \nShocked parishioners gathered at the Church of England building on Ascension Road today to survey the damage. Many were reduced to tears as they spoke of the recent restoration work and fundraising. The Bishop of Manchester meanwhile urged the public to pray for the congregation. The Rt Rev David Walker called the fire ‘devastating’.
