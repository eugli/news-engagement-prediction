He called on the state, local and ward executives of the party to commence aggressive mobilisation of electorate so that PDP can take over in the next governorship and other up coming elections. \nA legal practitioner and Chairman of the PDP in Anambra East LGA, Thompson Chikezie, recalled that the APGA-led administration in the state employed every dangerous means including the use of Boko Haram insurgents to take over power from PDP, but has failed to bring the change promised Nigerians. Dr Alex Obiogbolu, a PDP chieftain, felicitated with the local government meeting, enjoining members both old and new to close ranks to be able to win the upcoming governorship election. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:37:36.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
