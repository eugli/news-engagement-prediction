I think the Scientology is working.” RELATED Oscars 2017: Mahershala Ali Wins Best Supporting Actor for Moonlight \nKimmel went on to say he wanted to “bury the hatchet with someone I’ve had issues with”: his longtime nemesis, Matt Damon. While throwing out a few choice insults — “When I first met Matt, I was the fat one” — he gave Damon credit because he gave away an Oscar-caliber role in Manchester by the Sea to his childhood friend Casey Affleck “and made a Chinese ponytail movie instead. And that movie, The Great Wall , went on to lose $80 million. Smooth move, dumbass.” . @JimmyKimmel roasts Matt Damon: \"I've known Matt so long, when I first met Matt I was the fat one.\" https://t.co/LOhkJ3ZP65 #Oscars pic.twitter.com/LyJYpj9nso \n— ABC News (@ABC) February 27, 2017 \nMore quality zingers from Kimmel’s Oscar monologue: \n* He offered thanks to President Trump: “Remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?” \n* He marveled at the progress we saw in Hollywood films this year: “Black people saved NASA, and white people saved jazz. That’s what we call progress.” \n* On baby-faced La La Land director and nominee Damien Chazelle: “If he wins, he’ll be able to go to any college he wants.” \n* On the notoriously depressing nominee Manchester by the Sea , produced by Amazon, Kimmel joked that when people searched for the movie, they were told: “Customers who bought this item also purchased Zoloft.” \n* Channeling President Trump, Kimmel called out Meryl Streep for her “uninspiring and overrated” performances: “Meryl Streep has phoned it in for more than 50 films over the course of her lackluster career.” He also asked the crowd to give her a “totally undeserved round of applause” — and they, of course, obliged. \n— ABC News (@ABC) February 27, 2017 \nWe’ll add full video as soon as it’s available, but for now: What’d you think?
