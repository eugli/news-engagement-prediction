An unidentified woman says that while she was sitting on the tarmac in New Orleans on a Spirit Airlines flight to Fort Lauderdale, a flight attendant told her to 'cover up.' She said she wrapped herself in a coat, but the attendants still weren't satisfied, and when a female stranger came to her defense, both of them were tossed off the plane on January 30. Scroll down for video The unidentified woman said the airline complained that her cleavage in the outfit above was too much for the passengers on the plane 'It's not even about money. I was really embarrassed,' the woman told ABC 10 . At least two passengers took to Facebook and said that two attendants approached the woman and said 'her bosom was too exposed.' As the woman sat weeping, another woman who apparently stepped in to defend her was also kicked off. '[The second woman] didn't think it was very fair or right,' said the woman. She said she covered up in this coat but was still being hassled by flight attendants The second woman came to the first woman's defense on Facebook. 'She tried to pull her top up further to cover more, each time another flight attendant came with the same issue, telling her in loud and rude tones that she'll have leave the plane if she can't get them covered,' she wrote. Both of them were asked to de-board and the second woman wrote that she slept in the airport. 'I was protecting the meek,' she wrote. The first woman's mother, Donna Prieto, told the outlet, 'My daughter was humiliated because [the flight attendant] said it out loud.' Spirit Airlines denied that anyone got removed because of cleavage and said it was about 'behavior' Spirit Airlines, however, says the woman's bust was not taken into account in their decision. 'Nobody was taken off a plane because of cleavage,' said spokesman Paul Berry. 'People are taken off planes because of behavior.'
