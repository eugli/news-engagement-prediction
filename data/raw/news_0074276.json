He had accused Russia's president of launching an illegal war with Ukraine, prompting Western sanctions and an economic crisis.\nHe had also been planning to publish a file on Russian involvement in eastern Ukraine.\nNemtsov had called for \"honest elections\" hours before he was killed Tens of thousands marched through Moscow two days after his killing and thousands more attended his funeral.\nNemtsov's political allies believe the killing was meant to terrify them into silence.\nOpposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza has urged people to join anniversary rallies, which are also expected in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg.\nMr Kara-Murza is recovering abroad after an illness that left him in a medically induced coma. His symptoms were similar to a near-fatal illness in 2015 that he believed was the result of deliberate poisoning.\nThe trial of the five Chechens for Nemtsov's murder began in October.\nDaughter Zhanna Nemtsova: \"He was a figure Putin very much disliked\" The suspect who investigators say carried out the killing, Zaur Dadayev, was an officer under the command of pro-Moscow's Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia's Chechen Republic in the volatile North Caucasus.\nThe Chechen leader has denied any link to the killing.\nBoris Nemtsov murder: Who are the suspects?\nPresident Putin called the murder \"vile and cynical\" and vowed that those responsible would be held to account.\nRussia has seen several killings of high-profile politicians and journalists.\nBut the country has a long history of prosecuting alleged hit-men and then failing to follow the chain of command upwards to discover who ordered the murder or why, our Moscow correspondent Sarah Rainsford says.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1256/production/_94849640_030411854-1.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31834026", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/81366000/jpg/_81366969_moscow_nemtsov_624_v2.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-26T12:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:23:40.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
