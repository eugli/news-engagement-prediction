Photo: Bloomberg \nBut Turnbull persisted. \nPresumably someone who stood up to Margaret Thatcher, Kerry Packer and various others in big business has seen bravado and alpha-male bullying before. \nImportantly, the government believes it still has a deal over the 1250 refugees, and this has since been confirmed by the administration - despite several confusing qualifications. But Canberra is on tenterhooks, keenly aware that the eponymous administration is shambolic, and that the refugee agreement may not hold. \nWhat is not clear is whether Turnbull had to give anything away to get Trump's verbal agreement, given that the arch American deal-maker regarded it as such a bad trade. \nBill Shorten complained that once again, Australians have discovered important developments from sources at the American end. That is indeed a concern, given that news of the telephone conversation on Sunday morning was first revealed by the White House. Ditto for the precise number of refugees to be taken from Nauru and Manus. \nYet Shorten's point is something of a cheap shot unless he intends to make his sensitive conversations with world leaders public, should he become prime minister. Of course he would not. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:44:25.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
