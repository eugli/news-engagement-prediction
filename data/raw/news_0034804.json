If I get any kind of appreciation, it will be because my co-stars took that responsibility of getting the right temperament with me and vice versa,” says Siddiqui. \nThe actor, who was last seen in director Rahul Dholakia’s film Raees, feels that his co-star Shah Rukh Khan, helped him build a great onscreen chemistry. \n“The great thing about our shots was that Shah Rukh put in a lot of efforts and it ultimately made our scenes come out really well on the silver screen,” he says. \nSiddiqui, who has been part of films such as Gangs of Wasseypur(2012), Talaash(2012), The Lunchbox (2013) and Badlapur(2015), has often been tagged as an art house actor, but he doesn’t believe in such tags. \n“When I start working on a project, I don’t believe or classify it into commercial, independent or parallel cinema. A film can not be any of that, it can just be a good film or a bad one,” says the actor. \nFollow @htshowbiz for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:35:21.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
