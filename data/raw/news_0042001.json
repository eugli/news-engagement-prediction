The move is seen as an attempt to improve the quality of education. \n“The idea is to find out what students think about the way they are being taught. We are developing a system with a set of questions that will be distributed among the students to rate the teachers,” an official said. \n“In addition to this, a monthly report pro forma has also been circulated to the heads of various departments so that the monthly progress and activity report of the departments can be compiled,” said LU spokesman NK Pandey. \n“The university, through its Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC), will start the process of obtaining students’ feedback about the faculty engaged in teaching,” he said.

Ankita Khan, a BA first year student said, “This will help students as teachers will do a bit extra while teaching us in class.” \nPresident of the LU Teachers’ Association Dinesh Kumar is open to the idea but has some reservations too. \n“Only those students should be allowed to evaluate performance of teachers who have 75% attendance and are regular in class. If someone is not regular in class how will he assess a teacher’s ability,” Kumar said. \nBy and large, the university teachers have welcomed the idea. \nProf Manoj Dixit, head of public administration department, said: “To me it is good if used as a feedback tool only. Mutual feedback is always good. All necessary caution, however, needs to be taken. Democracy will take root through mutual feedback.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:43:47.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
