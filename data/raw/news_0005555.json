Guillaume Sicard, president, Nissan India Operations said, \"The Income tax rate cut from 10% to 5% for individual tax payers earning under Rs 5 lakh per annum will create a positive sentiment among likely first time buyers for entry level and small cars.\" Dittoed Abdul Majeed, partner, PwC, said, \"Reduction in individual tax rates in the Rs 2.5-5 lakh category should boost passenger vehicle demand. However, incentives to promote fuel efficient and alternate fuel would have benefitted the sector.\" Sicard too felt that the budget did not bring anything substantial for R&D for automotive industry, EV and Hybrid vehicles, which is a dampener. \"We look forward to the implementation of GST for the automotive sector in the months to come to offer the much needed stimulus to the auto industry and encourage buyer sentiment and consumer confidence,\" he said. Gaurav Karnik, tax partner, automotive practice, EY, said the budget did not live up to the expectations of the auto industry. \"No specific incentives were given to the auto industry except for some minor procedural relief by way of exemption of tax collected at source provisions for buyers such as central and state governments, embassies, public sector companies engaged in the business of carrying passengers.\" \"The much widely expected cut in corporate tax rates did not happen except for companies having turnover not exceeding Rs 500 million although the increased allocation of funds for rural economy and infrastructure sector could help segments such as two-wheeler, tractors, CV and earthmover industry along with their suppliers,\" he added.
