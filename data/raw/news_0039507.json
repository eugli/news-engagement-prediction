We are living in a time when unity will make America great. This is a special moment for all Americans of good will to band together to promote the kind of compassion and equality for others that we want for ourselves.” \nThe Def Jam co-founder will be joined by Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding and Imam Shamsi Ali of the Jamaica Muslim Center. \nTrump’s executive order — Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States — known as the “Muslim Ban,” was put into effect a week after he was inaugurated. This prevented people traveling on passports from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen from entering the country as well as green card holders from re-entering. \nOn February 9, the Federal appeals court ruled 3-0 against the ban.
