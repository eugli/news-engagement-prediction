By Rebecca Shapiro \nDavid Bowie mega-fans have a big idea for memorializing the late star ― so big in fact, that the statue would be the height of a small building. \nIn Bowie’s birthplace of Brixton, south London, a group of artists have banded together to propose a 3-story-tall lightning bolt to pay tribute to the singer. \nIt’s an homage to the lightning bolt the artist had painted on his face on the cover of his 1973 album “ Aladdin Sane .” Bowie died at the age of 69 last year, following an 18-month battle with cancer. \nThe London-based design group This Ain’t Rock ’N’ Roll is leading the charge for the statue in coordination with Bowie’s teams in the United Kingdom’s capital and New York City. \nThe plans call for the memorial to be built five streets from Bowie’s birthplace on Stansfield Road , the BBC reported Tuesday. \n“When David Bowie died, the world lost an irreplaceable talent. Brixton also lost a son. David Bowie, our Brixton boy,” says a press release for the project . “Now the Brixton community is building a permanent memorial in the place of his birth.” \nOrganizers are seeking to raise £990,000 (about $1.2 million) via a U.K.crowdfunding website for the project. The campaign goes through March 21. \nBowie was also honored with a lightning bolt-shaped constellation last year. MIRA Public Observatory in Brussels, Belgium, teamed up with local radio station Studio Brussel to register the group of stars. \nLearn more about the Brixton lightning memorial in the video above.
