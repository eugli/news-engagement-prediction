Cops claimed that liquor was being smuggled into Bihar, a dry state, ahead of Holi (March 12, 13) festival. The SIT claimed that it was one of the biggest seizures in the district post liquor ban on April 5, 2016, and the second in three days, worth over Rs 1 crore. \nConfirming the recovery, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Muzaffarpur, Vivek Kumar, said the arrested persons had been identified as Farookh (driver), Talim (cleaner) and Sanjan Kumar. \nSources said liquor mafia, having strong political contact, was behind it. They claimed that some police officers were also extending patronage to such traders. \nThe SSP had in January this year suspended two constables after a video, showing them dancing, holding liquor bottles, alongside an alleged liquor mafia of the town, went viral on social media. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:51:01.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
