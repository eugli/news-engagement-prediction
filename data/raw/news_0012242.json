That sketch was pretty clearly eclipsed by McCarthy’s insane portrayal of a pissed-off Spicer yelling at and literally charging the podium at reporters. \nA Politico report tonight says the sketch did not go over well at the White House, and there was one part in particular that bothered Trump: \nMore than being lampooned as a press secretary who makes up facts, it was Spicer’s portrayal by a woman that was most problematic in the president’s eyes, according to sources close to him. \nWell, this detail was all it took to get Twitter to start fancasting other actresses and comediennes who could play certain roles on SNL (you may notice one recurring name in particular): ROSIE O'DONNELL NEEDS TO START PLAYING TRUMP ON SNL RIGHT FUCKING NOW https://t.co/F3NjS22GVp \n— Zach Heltzel (@zachheltzel) February 7, 2017 omg if Rosie O'Donnell plays Steve Bannon on this weekend's #SNL , it might actually be enough to get Trump to fire him \n— Mere Smith (@EvilGalProds) February 7, 2017 Time for Ellen to call SNL and volunteer to play Mike Pence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:13:10.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
