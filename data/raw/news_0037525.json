Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Photos: Chien-Shiung Wu – Chinese-American physicist Chien-Shiung Wu (1912-1997) focused her research predominantly on the techniques of experimental physics and radioactivity. She was known for her work on the Manhattan Project, which produced the first nuclear weapon during World War II. Her nicknames included the \"First Lady of Physics\", \"Chinese Marie Curie\" and \"Madame Wu\". Hide Caption 1 of 19 Photos: Marie Curie – Polish-born French physicist Marie Curie (1867-1934) discovered polonium and radium. Her work led to the creation of X-rays -- a crucial component of modern-day medicine. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only woman to win this award in two categories: Physics and Chemistry. Hide Caption 2 of 19 Photos: Alice Hamilton – American Alice Hamilton (1869-1970) was a pioneer in the field of toxicology. She researched the effects of lead poison on factory workers, isolated a typhoid fever outbreak in 1902, and lent her expertise to help crack down on the sale of cocaine to children in Chicago. She was also the first female faculty member of Harvard Medical School. Hide Caption 3 of 19 Photos: Lise Meitner – Austrian physicist Lise Meitner (1878-1968) was a key member of a small group of scientists who discovered nuclear fission. Notably, one of her colleagues and her long-time collaborator, Otto Hahn, was awarded the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on nuclear fission. Meitner's exclusion has since been considered to be an error by the Nobel committee. Hide Caption 4 of 19 Photos: Hilde Mangold – German embryologist Hilde Mangold (1898-1924), along with Hans Spemann, discovered the embryonic organizer. Their work led to further understanding of the pattern of embryo differentiation in all amphibians and formed the foundation for the field of experimental embryology. Mangold died young, but in 1935 Spemann was awarded the Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery. Hide Caption 5 of 19 Photos: Rachel Carson – American marine biologist and conservationist Rachel Carson (1907-1964) was also an author. After WWII, she focused on warning the public about the long-term effects of misusing pesticides. Her book Silent Spring and other works challenged the practices of agricultural scientists and are credited with advancing the global environmental movement. Hide Caption 6 of 19 Photos: Rita Levi-Montalcini – Italian neuroscientist Rita Levi-Montalcini (1909-2012) was known for her work in neurobiology. Along with Stanley Cohen, she won the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of nerve growth factor, a protein controlling growth and development. Prior to her death in 2012, she was the oldest living Nobel laureate and first ever to reach their 100th birthday. Hide Caption 7 of 19 Photos: Virginia Apgar – American-Armenian pioneer anaesthesiologist Virginia Apgar (1909-1974) developed the APGAR score (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration), a well-known system to evaluate the health of newborn babies. The Apgar score came into general use throughout the United States and has since been adopted by numerous other countries. Hide Caption 8 of 19 Photos: Gertrude B. Elion – U.S. biochemist Gertrude B. Elion (1918-1999) helped develop many drugs, including ones used to treat malaria, herpes, meningitis and leukemia. In 1988, Elion, together with George Hitchings and Sir James Black, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their research and insight into the principles of drug treatments. Hide Caption 9 of 19 Photos: Jane C. Wright – American Jane C. Wright (1910-2013) was a physician who explored the relationship between patient and tissue culture response and developed chemotherapy as a viable treatment for cancer. She developed chemotherapy delivery methods by way of a catheter system and became the director of the Cancer Research Foundation at Harlem Hospital by age 33. Hide Caption 10 of 19 Photos: Rosalind Franklin – British chemist, crystallographer and biophysicist Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958) was the first to hypothesize and show, through x-ray diffraction, the double helix structure of DNA. Her discovery laid the ground work for Francis Crick and James Watson's molecular model of DNA. The Nobel Prize can only be shared by three living scientists and so Franklin was barely acknowledged when it was awarded to Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins for the discovery of the double-helix in 1962. Hide Caption 11 of 19 Photos: Stephanie Kwolek – American chemist Stephanie Kwolek (1923-2014) was awarded the DuPont Company's Lavoisier Medal for outstanding technical achievement in 1995. Her career at the company spanned over forty years. She is best known for inventing Kevlar, an immensely strong plastic that was first used as a replacement for steel reinforcing strips, in 1965. Hide Caption 12 of 19 Photos: Jane Goodall – British primatologist Dame Jane Goodall, 81, is best known for her long-term research on wild chimpanzees in Tanzania. She founded, the Jane Goodall Institute Research Center in Gombe National Park, which is the world's longest running continuous wildlife research project. She also started Roots & Shoots, the Institute's global environmental and humanitarian program for young people. Hide Caption 13 of 19 Photos: Margaret Chan – Hong Kong Chinese and Canadian physician Margaret Chan OBE, 68, is Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) . She began her career in public health with the Hong Kong Department of Health where she was appointed Director in 1994. Three years later, while in this role, she handled the first human outbreak of H5N1 Avian Influenza and in 2003 successfully combated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong. Hide Caption 14 of 19 Photos: France A. Córdova – American astrophysicist France A. Córdova, 68, is Director of the National Science Foundation. She rose to this position after working as a prominent researcher of X-ray and gamma ray sources stemming from her work on pulsars. She was the youngest and first female Chief Scientist at NASA from 1993 to 1996 and later went on to be awarded NASA's highest honor, the Distinguished Service Medal. Hide Caption 15 of 19 Photos: Fabiola Gianotti – Italian particle physicist Fabiola Gianotti, 53, is the first female Director-General of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and led the institution during the recent discovery of the Higgs boson as part of the ATLAS experiment. Hide Caption 16 of 19 Photos: Cori Bargmann – American neurobiologist Cornelia \"Cori\" Bargmann, 55, is an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute . She is known for her work on the behavior in C.elegans, or roundworms, which she used to characterize genes and neural pathways that allow the nervous system to generate variable behaviors. Her work led to her being elected into the National Academy of Sciences.

She founded revolutionary blood diagnostics company, Theranos , which uses a prick of blood to get the same results as you would from an entire vial. Hide Caption Story highlights Reshma Saujani: Yale's renaming of Calhoun College to memorialize Grace Hopper matters Bestowing a particular name on a community shows the world what kind of legacy that community wants, she says Reshma Saujani is the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code, a national nonprofit organization working to close the gender gap in technology. She is the author of \"Women Who Don't Wait in Line\" and is a graduate of Yale Law School. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. (CNN) Who an institution memorializes says a lot about what it stands for. Reshma Saujani Earlier this month, I was proud to see Yale University, my graduate alma mater, stand for women's advancement in technology when it renamed Calhoun College -- named for John C. Calhoun, vice president to John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson -- for Grace Murray Hopper. In Yale's case, each of its 12 residential colleges is a microcosm of the wider student body; students are assigned to one of the colleges as freshmen and remain affiliated until graduation. Bestowing a particular name on a community shows the world what kind of legacy the community wants for itself. Calhoun was a white supremacist who passionately promoted slavery. Grace Hopper, who completed her master's and doctorate degrees at Yale and has been called the \"queen of code\" and the \"mother of computing,\" was a pioneering computer programmer (in addition to a rear admiral in the Navy). In one move, the renaming denounced a culture of bigotry and racism, creating a space for hidden figures like Hopper. The decision draws a line marking what's tolerable and intolerable and what's valued. It shows us that systems can and do evolve toward progress. Celebrating Hopper helps enhance women's voices and recognize women's contributions to the technology field. Yale renames Calhoun College after protests Yale's renaming is the latest in a series of overdue recognitions for Hopper , who died in 1992 at age 85. President Obama awarded her a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom, saying , \"If Wright is flight and Edison is light, then Hopper is code.\" Read More At Girls Who Code, we know symbols and role models play a significant role in sparking and sustaining girls' interest in technology. We often say, \"You cannot be what you cannot see.\" It's a reminder that whom we shed light on (and whom we don't) matters in shaping our students' perceptions of what they can be. It's why we create space in our curriculum to lift up diverse role models. The prospect of Grace Hopper College at Yale also reminds us how important technology is in shaping our collective future. Computing jobs are some of the fastest-growing and highest paying in our country, and yet as a joint report by Girls Who Code and Accenture found , of the 500,000 open jobs in computing in the United States last year, only 40,000 new computer science graduates were able to fill them. Of those 40,000 graduates, only 18% were women. Computing skills are a critical path to security and prosperity in today's job market. What's the state of sisterhood in the time of Trump? (opinion) Girls Who Code was founded on the belief that access to a computer science education could bring women into a thriving innovation economy and give families a real shot at the middle class. We believe the only way we can make this economy work for all of us is by making sure girls don't get left behind in such a critical field. Through focusing on girls in middle and high school, where we're seeing the highest drop-offs, our research has found we can triple the number of women in computing and grow their share of computing jobs from 24% to 39% by 2025. We feel strongly that Hopper, who pioneered this field before women were even admitted to Yale as undergraduates, would applaud our mission. Memorializing Hopper's work significantly opens pathways for uplifting women's contributions to the field and the products we use day in and day out. I'm amazed everyday by the projects and ideas our girls create. From games like \" Tampon Run ,\" which address the menstruation taboo and gun violence, to websites that document the life of an undocumented immigrant in the United States, to an app that helps women of color find hair products, our project gallery shows how girls from across the country are using technology to solve problems in their day-to-day lives and make a positive impact on the world. In doing so, they are empowering themselves to be not just consumers but creators of technology and paving the way for a new generation of women to take on the field. Follow CNN Opinion \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook It's decisions like the newly named Hopper College that make me proud to call Yale my alma mater. Memorializing Grace Murray Hopper signifies a cultural shift and sheds light on the role technology will play in enhancing women's voices for generations to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T17:57:02.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
