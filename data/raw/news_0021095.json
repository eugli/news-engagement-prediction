Picture: Supplied AAP and staff writers News Corp Australia Network Share Share on Twitter \nISLAMIC State fighter Khaled Sharrouf is believed to have become the first dual national stripped of Australian citizenship under anti-terrorism laws. \nA spokeswoman for Immigration Minister Peter Dutton told AAP on Saturday an individual had been stripped of citizenship under anti-terror laws which passed parliament in 2015. \nShe declined to name the person but The Australian reports it is Sharrouf. Khaled Sharrouf and boys believed to be two of his three sons stand in front of the Islamic State flag in an image posted on Twitter. Picture: Supplied Source: Twitter \nThe Weekend Australian reported a secret panel of intelligence ­officers, police, bureaucrats and lawyers cancelled Sharrouf’s Australian citizenship earlier this year. \nSharrouf, the son of Lebanese migrants, must now rely on his Lebanese citizenship, if he chooses to ever leave Syria. \nThe father of five made worldwide headlines in 2014 after images surfaced of himself and his young son holding up the severed head of a Syrian government official. \nSharrouf travelled to Syria in late 2013 with his friend, fellow Sydney man Mohamed Elomar. \nSharrouf’s wife, Tara Nettleton, also travelled to Syria with their children, but she has since died . The fate of the children is unknown although it was reported his eldest daughter Zaynab, now 15, was married off to Elomar who she had a child with. Elomar was later killed in a drone strike. \nIn 2015 there were unconfirmed reports Sharrouf had died.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:36:55.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
