As the film's producers were making their acceptance speeches, producer Jordan Horowitz informed viewers that the category's winner was actually Moonlight , and showed the card announcing the winner to the camera. \nBeatty informed the stunned audience that he paused after seeing Stone's name on the winner's card (Stone had won best actress for La La Land just minutes before). He then showed the card to Dunaway, who quickly read off La La Land . \n\"I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, La La Land,\" Beatty explained. \"That's why I looked at Faye, and at you. I wasn't trying to be funny.\" \n\"Warren, what did you do?!\" joked Kimmel, who then added, \"I knew I would screw this show up.\" \nAdele Romanski, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner produced the film. \nThe A24 release earned eight Oscar nominations, making it one of the second-highest nominated titles of the night ( Arrival also had eight, and La La Land led with 14). Throughout the evening, it won the Oscar for best adapted screenplay, as well as for supporting actor Mahershala Ali . \nBased on Tarell Alvin McCraney's play, the intimate Moonlight looks at the life of a young black man growing up in a tough Miami neighborhood. The story is told through three chapters of his life, each of which features different actors as the central character at different ages. It's a story to which writer-director Jenkins related because, like a character played by Oscar nominee Naomie Harris, his mother was previously addicted to crack cocaine. \n\"Instead of shooting her over the course of five weeks, we shot all her work in three days. So for three days I am just living in walking therapy,\" he previously told The Hollywood Reporter . \"It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do because I had to separate myself, the director, from myself the human being, reliving all these things that I've tried my hardest to not relive.\" \nThe film began garnering critical acclaim upon its debut at the Telluride Film Festival , also for notable performances by supporting actors Ali and Harris. The drama won the top nod at the Golden Globes and swept the indie-lauding Spirit Awards . Shot for under $5 million, the film has grossed $22 million at the worldwide box office. \nThe 89th annual Academy Awards, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, took place at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on Sunday.
