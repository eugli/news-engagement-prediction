the 20-year-old midfielder’s fourth goal in six starts since joining Huddersfield. \nAnd the impressive Wells doubled the lead after another fine move 10 minutes later, rifling a right-footed shot into the far corner from right-hand side of the penalty area. \nFreeman, recently signed from Bristol City, hauled Rangers back into the game eight minutes after coming off the bench. media_camera Massimo Luongo. \nHuddersfield were unable to clear Kazenga LuaLua’s cross from the left and when the ball dropped to Freeman 20 yards out, he fired home. \nQPR were very much second best up to that point, although Conor Washington had almost given them an early lead. \nAfter some neat Rangers link-up play, Grant Hall slipped the ball through to Washington, whose shot was tipped on to the post by keeper Danny Ward. Elsewhere, Norwich thrashed Nottingham Forest 5-1. Leeds suffered an upset 2-1 loss to Cardiff, Derby and Bristol drew 3-3, Rotherham and Blackburn 1-1 and it was scoreless between Reading and Barnsley. \nPreston North End, Ipswich and Fulham all recorded wins over Brentford, Aston Villa and Wigan respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:54:04.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
