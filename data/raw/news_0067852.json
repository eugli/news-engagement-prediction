They stated this on Thursday in response to statement reportedly made by Sheriff on Wednesday when he received members of the party from the South West. Sheriff was on Friday declared the rightful National Chairman of the PDP by the Court of Appeal, Port Harcourt, Rivers State. The former Borno Governor had on Wednesday said he would quit office as “soon as a national convention is held and new national officers are produced.” But the PDP governors, who are members of Ahmed Makarfi-led faction, maintained that they would never be part of the convention. Speaking on the development with our correspondent on Thursday , the chairman of the PDP Governors Forum and Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, said the proposed convention would be an exercise in futility. He said, “We will never be part of the convention because it is an exercise in futility. “The case is already at the Supreme Court so we await the outcome of the case. “I repeat, Sheriff is a general without army. Who are his governors or top political office holders? “He is an agent of destabilisation in the PDP: he is a mole of the All Progressives Congress.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:18:28.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
