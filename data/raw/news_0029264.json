Riders on a raft were sent up a hump, before a 15-metre drop into a swimming pool. \nBut this adventure, on August 5 last year, ended with unspeakable tragedy. In a horrific accident, 10-year-old Caleb was killed when his raft went airborne and he was decapitated. \nSix months later, the devastated Schwabs has spoken for the first time about that fateful day at Schlitterbahn Kansas City water park. Caleb Schwab was killed instantly. Source: Supplied Caleb (second from right) with his family, including brother Nathan (right). Source: Supplied \n“Six went to the park, and five came back,” Scott Schwab told Good Morning America in a harrowing new interview . \nThe politician recalled the moment Caleb and Nathan headed off with friends to check out the Verruckt. \n“Before they took off, I said, ‘Brothers stick together,’” Mr Schwab said. “He (Caleb) said, ‘I know, Dad’.” \nNathan had been waiting at the bottom of the slide when Caleb was killed. The first their parents knew something had happened was when Nathan went running back to find them. \n“He was screaming: ‘He flew from Verruckt! He flew from Verruckt!’” Michele Schwab told GMA . \nShe said they rushed to the scene, where a man tried to stop her from getting too close. “He just kept saying, ‘Trust me, you don’t want to go any further’,” she said. Two other women sharing Caleb’s raft were injured but survived. Source: Supplied Caleb was killed when his raft became airborne. Source: Supplied \nMr Schwab said he was in such disbelief, he demanded the man confirm Caleb was dead. \n“I said, ‘I just need to hear you say, is my son dead?’ and he just shook his head,” Mr Schwab said. “‘I need to hear it from you, is he dead?’ \n“And he said, ‘Yes, your son’s dead’.” \nIt is understood the raft Caleb was riding with two other women became airborne due to uneven weight distribution. One of the women suffered a broken jaw and the other rider had a broken bone in her face. \nNews of Caleb’s death, and the terrible scenes of his raft flying into the air , made headlines around the world after the August 5 incident. It also prompted thrillseekers to share their own safety concerns and hairy experiences on the Verruckt . The Verruckt was considered the biggest water slide in the world.

Source: AP \nSchlitterbahn Kansas City was shut down for inspection after the incident and later reopened, but the Verruckt has been remained closed indefinitely . \nThe Schwab family has since reached a wrongful death settlement with Schlitterbahn’s owners and the manufacturer of the raft. \n“It’s an accident, but there’s an accounting because someone was negligent,” Scott Schwab told GMA . \n“We have a box of greeting cards from around the world, and we just want people to know that one, we’re thankful. And yeah, we’re still hurting, but we’re going to be OK.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:09:52.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
