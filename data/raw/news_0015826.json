Zayn teamed up with Taylor Swift for I Don't Wanna Live Forever (Photo: Splash News) \nHowever, he has also been forced to cancel a number of planned appearances owing to his struggles with anxiety, including a much-anticipated performance at Capital Summertime Ball in June 2016. \nIn a statement, he explained at the time: \"Unfortunately, anxiety, which has haunted me throughout the last few months around live performances has got the better of me... with the magnitude of the event, I have suffered the worst anxiety of my career. \n\"I cannot apologize enough, but I want to be honest with everyone who has patiently waited to see me. I promise I will do my best to make this up to everybody I've let down today.
