Look at the last couple of All-Star Games. There are a lot of first-timers, a lot of guys under the age of 24 or 25. I feel like the younger the game continues to get, the younger the audience is going to get.” \nThe MLB has tested with a number of different tactics in order to speed-up games, including decreasing the time in between pitches and cutting down on a number of mound visits allowed per game. Price offered a much simpler means of adding more excitement to the game. \n“Let us wear whatever cleats we want, that will increase interest,” Price said. “I think that’s very simple and would make everyone happy.” \nPrice believes freedom of footwear will not only appease the fans, but also the players. \n“That’s one of the easiest things we can do that is going to please everybody,” he said. “There’s nobody who is going to be mad. If you want to wear all black cleats like Jackie Bradley, you can wear all black cleats. For guys who want to express themselves, they need to be able to do that. Guys are turning to express themselves on the field with their play and whatever it is. You should be able to do it on your shoes and express themselves that way as well.” \nThumbnail photo via Rick Osentoski/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T15:40:57.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
