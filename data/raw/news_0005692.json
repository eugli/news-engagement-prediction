We’re happy that the atmosphere is serene, everything is calm and working well. We are going back to write our report,” said Gumel. \nThe Senate described Ugwuanyi’s utilization of the bailout funds released to Enugu State government as impressive and in line with the principles of accountability. \nGumel told newsmen that their scrutiny of the state’s record revealed that Ugwuanyi was transparent and prudent in the use of the funds in a way the committee had not experienced anywhere else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:55:01.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
