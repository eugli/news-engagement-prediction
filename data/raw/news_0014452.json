It must be exhausting searching for the devil in everything except Donald Trump. \n“They say she’s going to stand on top of the stadium, ruling over everyone with drones everywhere, surveilling everyone in a big swarm,” he said, as Independent reports, “To just condition them to say ‘I am the Goddess of Satan’ ruling over them with the rise of the robots in a ritual of lesser magic.” The face of evil. Giphy \nThat's right. No matter gay, straight, or bi, lesbian, transgender life, Gaga is the Goddess of Satan ready to steal your soul.
