The beach became a graveyard for tragic migrants (Photo: Libyan Red Crescent) A torn rubber dinghy was found nearby (Photo: Libyan Red Crescent) \nLibya is the main departure point for migrants hoping to flee war, poverty and oppression to reach Europe by sea. \nMostly they try to cross in flimsy inflatable craft loaded with small amounts of fuel which are intended to get them only as far as European rescue vessels stationed in international waters. \nSeveral British warships have taken part in massive rescue operations in which thousands of migrants have been pulled out of the water just out of sight of the coast of Libya. Red Crescent workers carry one of the bodies off the beach in a bodybag (Photo: Libyan Red Crescent) (Photo: Libyan Red Crescent) \nRoyal Navy warships involved in rescue operations stay out of sight of the Libyan coast for fear of being hit by al-Qaeda or Islamic State missiles. \nBritish Royal Navy ships like HMS Bulwark have in the past then taken the migrants on to drop-off points in Sicily, where they are processed, given food and shelter and can have asylum claims scrutinised. \nPeople smugglers - many of whom have deals with Islamic State terrorists - can make hundreds of thousnds of pounds from each boatload. The body bags are labelled before being moved off the beach (Photo: Libyan Red Crescent) The bodies were recovered on the beach (Photo: Libyan Red Crescent) \nThe badly-made migrant boats have to travel 800 miles to Libya and often capsize so an international armada of rescue ships is on daily patrol to stop passengers drowning. \nThe ruthless trafficking gangs are being hunted down by western special forces and Italian police - with rescue boats carrying detailed descriptions and photographs of the ring-leaders. \nThe Daily Mirror has seen British Royal Marines arresting several suspected people smugglers aboard a sinking boat as they were brought onto HMS Bulwark. Red Crescent workers walk back down the beach to collect more corpses (Photo: Libyan Red Crescent) \nThe men were then handed over to a Sicilian special investigations unit and it is believed they were trying to pretend to be migrants and set up a base in Sicily. \nMost depart from the stretch of Libyan coast between Tripoli and the Tunisian border to the west. \nThe bodies of those who drown are frequently found washed up on Libyan shores- victims of Mediterranean storms or vicious tides. More than 270 people migrating are believed to have drowned in the Mediterranean in the first weeks of 2017 (Photo: Libyan Red Crescent) \nLast year a record 181,000 migrants crossed between Libya and Italy. More than 4,500 are known to have died. \nHaving largely closed off sea crossings between Turkey and Greece last year, the European Union is searching for ways to stem the flow of migrants from Libya. \nThis month European leaders offered Libya money and other assistance to try to reduce the numbers departing across the Mediterranean. \nAid groups criticised the move, saying such plans exposed migrants to further risks and abuses within Libya.
