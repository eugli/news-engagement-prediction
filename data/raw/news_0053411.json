At sportsbooks, gamblers are tasked with picking whether a team will win more or fewer games than their over/under total. \nThere are six teams, three in each league, with an over/under win total north of 90. Last year at the beginning of spring training, the Cubs were the only such team. At the other end of the spectrum, the Chicago White Sox (68.5) and the San Diego Padres (67.5) are projected to be the worst teams in each league. \nCork Gaines/Business Insider ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:36:43.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
