Figlio , the Orrington   in the School of Education and Social Policy, and Director and Faculty Fellow of the Institute for Policy Research , has been appointed dean of the School of Education and Social Policy (SESP) at Northwestern University, effective Sept. 1. \nHe will succeed Penelope Peterson, who will retire as dean Aug. 31 after serving 20 years in that leadership role. \nFiglio, who is also a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, is highly regarded nationally and internationally for his scholarship on school accountability, choice,   design, intergenerational issues in health and education, and student learning outcomes in higher education. As Director of the Institute for Policy Research since 2012, Figlio has led significant change at the Institute, including restructuring support staff roles, establishing new systems of shared governance and decision-making, launching new collaborations with other institutes and schools across Northwestern, and spearheading collaborative ventures with partners, including the Evanston and Chicago public school districts. “I am very pleased that David Figlio has accepted our offer to lead the School of Education and Social Policy,” Northwestern Provost Daniel Linzer said. “His energy, collaborative spirit and ability to provide intellectual leadership on a wide range of education and policy issues make him an outstanding choice for leading the school forward in this critical time for education and our country.” Figlio is immediate Past President of the Association for Education Finance and Policy and co-leads a National Science Foundation network of policymakers, practitioners and scholars regarding the use of administrative data in educational research.

The combination of research, teaching and outreach that is conducted across the school enables all members of the school to have a role in making the world a better place.” Figlio’s work has been published in numerous leading journals, including the American Economic Review , American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, Review of Economics and Statistics and Journal of Human Resources.
