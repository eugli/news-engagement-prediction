Why make such a bold statement? Well, because film reboots of older TV shows pretty much always deliver in some way or another. \nIn recent years we’ve seen a lot of films reboot older shows and we’re hard-pressed to sincerely complain about any of them. We need only point to the reboot of 21 Jump Street as proof that, as long as you don’t take things too seriously, a fun film can be produced. This new big screen incarnation of the 1990s lifeguard series Baywatch appears to know exactly what it is and, unless they’re pulling a fast one on us, it seems like it’ll be full of in-jokes and not-so-serious nods to what made the original show iconic. \nThe film stars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson in the role of Mitchell “Mitch” Buchannon that was made famous by none other than the legendary David “The Hoff” Hasselhoff. Joining him in his lifeguard exploits is a new recruit, played by Zac Efron , who seems to serve as the main annoyance of the veteran Buchannon. Efron and Johnson is a comedic team-up we simply cannot wait to see. \nBecause it’s the Baywatch universe, we can likely expect some sort of caper that can only be solved with the expertise and skill set that lifeguarding affords to a choice few. \nBaywatch hits the beach and theaters May 26, 2017 and also stars Alexandra Daddario , Kelly Rohrbach, and Priyanka Chopra. Also, for any BW purists, your prayers might be answered with a cameo or two from David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson. \nWhat are your thoughts on the Baywatch movie?
