Have your say here Watch | Sutton goalie admits telling friends to bet on pie-eating stunt 00:29 Telegraph Sport 21 February 2017 • 5:53pm \nS utton United goalkeeper Wayne Shaw has resigned from the club hours after the Gambling Commission and the Football Association announced investigations into a pie-eating stunt gone wrong. \nShaw was filmed consuming the pie on the substitutes bench during his side's 2-0 FA Cup defeat by Arsenal but admitted after the game he knew a bookmaker was offering odds on him being seen eating - something that could leave him in breach of football's anti-betting rules. \nThe news has left many divided on where the blame lies and whether Shaw should have been forced to hand in his resignation. \nBut what do you think? Have your say in the comments section at the bottom of the page. What Shaw has said \n\"A few of the lads said to me earlier on, 'What is going on with the 8-1 about eating a pie?' I said, 'I don't know, I've eaten nothing all day, so I might give it a go later on'.\" \n\"As I say what is that? Sun Bets had us at 8-1 to eat a pie? I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let's do it. All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down.\" Shaw eats the pie last night What the club have said \n\"This decision was taken at board level,\" the club's manager Paul Doswell told Sky News. \"We felt we had to take very strong actions. The chairman spoke to him this afternoon and Wayne offered his resignation.\" \n\"I'm devastated, the chairman is devastated. I have spoken to Wayne and the guy is in tears, crying down the phone. It is a very sad situation.\" \nS peaking on BBC 5 Live, chairman Bruce Elliott said earlier today, before Shaw resigned: \"If you knew the roly poly goalkeeper you probably wouldn't be very surprised. But Wayne is a top man. \n\"I didn't know anything about it. He has got himself in the papers again and the fame obviously has gone to his head a little bit, but we will soon bring him back down to earth, don't worry about that.\" Manager Paul Doswell says it's a \"sad situation\" Credit: Rex What the gambling commission and FA said \n\"Integrity in sport is not a joke,\" said Richard Watson, enforcement and intelligence director at the Gambling Commission. \n\"We'll be looking into any irregularity in the betting market and establishing whether the operator has met its licence requirement to conduct its business with integrity.\" \nA n FA spokesperson said: \"We are investigating to establish whether there has been any breach of The FA rules relating to betting.\" What others have said How many of us wouldn't look after a few mates with 8/1 odds on eating a pie? We'd all be on the gravy train. — Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) February 21, 2017 Gutted to hear Wayne Shaw has resigned from Sutton. Feel he's been hung out to dry by the betting company involved. pic.twitter.com/jUZcagMLtj — Chris Wheatley (@ChrisWheatley_) February 21, 2017 This Wayne Shaw sacking just about sums up the pathetically PC-crazed world we now have to endure. Shame on you, Sutton United. — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) February 21, 2017 Still relax everyone. Wayne Shaw has lost his job and a huge international betting company won't have to fork out £160 for its own joke. — Danny Baker (@prodnose) February 21, 2017 Don't want to get into an argument as the rules are clear, so take your grievances to the FA. — Stan Collymore (@StanCollymore) February 21, 2017 \nYou can comment below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:22:51.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
