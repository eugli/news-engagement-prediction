It's amazing she wasn't picked up by one of them, or a cat. 'It would be interesting to know where she has all been. It must have been some adventure.' The curious creature miraculously survived sub-zero temperatures, snow and rain as it scurried about the busy built-up area for a month-and-a-half. Her adventure only came to an end when she turned up outside the town's Allandalle House care home last month. A worker, who was on her cigarette break, initially mistook Gingy for a rat, before she scooped him up and took him home. Gingy managed to scale this seven foot wall - and was eventually found a mile away In a lucky twist of fate, the next day she sent her husband to the local pet shop, where Liam's aunt Anna Anderson is manager. Mrs Anderson had bought Gingy for Liam six months earlier because he wanted a ginger hamster to match his hair. She said: 'The man came into the shop and asked what he needed for a hamster because his wife had found one. We got talking and I said, 'it's not ginger, by any chance? and he said, 'yes, it's ginger and white'. 'I showed him photos of Gingy and, when I phoned Liam's mum to tell her we might have found her, Liam over-heard the conversation and was so happy he was doing cartwheels. 'She was a lot skinnier than before and we were worried she might not be as tame after being away for so long, but when she saw Liam it was almost like she thought, 'Thank God, it's you'. 'That is one lucky hamster.' Liam had been so upset at losing Gingy his aunt had bought him another hamster just days before his pet turned up. But his mum said: 'He kept asking about Gingy. Now he's got her back, he's over-the-moon. 'But we have no idea how she managed to get out of her cage, let alone the garden. 'We've got a cat flap for our chihuahuas and we think that's how he got out of the house. But the garden has slabs and a seven-foot dyke. It's not like there was earth for her to have dug through. 'But thanks to a lot of coincidences we've finally got her back.' Not only was it luck that the woman sent her husband to Paws and Claws Pet Emporium, but it was Mrs Anderson's first day back at work after being off ill. Mrs Lawrie, an administrator, who is also mum to Layton, 11, said: 'If anyone else had served the man they might not have put two and two together. 'We still can't believe she survived so long. It's a miracle. 'Now we have two hamsters, and we have locks on both their cages so neither of them can escape because we have no idea how she did it.'
