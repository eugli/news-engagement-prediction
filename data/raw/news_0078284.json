Couple born on same day in same hospital and went to same school marry 50 years later \nThe 33-year-old became involved with the vulnerable woman while working for the Metropolitan Police’s Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command. \nThe pair then kissed as she took her fingerprints before sleeping together at the victim;s grandfather’s house on February 24 last year. \nTheir final meeting took place at Liverpool Street Station where it was suggested the pair had sex in the toilets in McDonald’s. Their last sexual encounter occurred in a toilet in a McDonald’s toilet (Picture; Google Street View) \nBut Peters refused to leave her long term partner and threatened to kill herself when the victim told staff at the refuge where she had been housed. \nA Metropolitan Police misconduct hearing was told Peters joined the force in June 2006 and was posted to Islington borough. \nHer commanding officer, detective chief superintendent Ivan Balhatchet, said Peters was ‘a popular member of her team’ who would have had a ‘promising career ahead of her.’ \nBut assistant commissioner Martin Hewitt said her conviction ‘seriously undermines public confidence in the police. \nHe said: ‘Having considered the matter fully and having regard to the nature and severity of the breaches of the standards of professional behaviour, my decision is that PC Peters is dismissed without notice.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T23:10:36.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
