The creation was unveiled at the world's biggest science conference in Boston. Researcher Dr Phillip Nadeau, from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: 'The self-powered pill would monitor your vital signs from inside for weeks' It was inspired by a lemon battery which uses citric acid to charge a zinc nail and copper penny electrodes. A version of the pill, that powers up when a zinc electrode interacts with stomach acid, was tested on pigs. Small sensors continually monitor temperature and heart rate. The 30mm-long device took six days to travel through the digestive tract of a pig. Scientists want to create a smaller version of the pill for humans - the prototype measures 10mm. The version with star-shaped arms is designed to stay in the stomach without risking blockages. Brigham and Women's Hospital's Giovanni Traverso said: 'Taking a capsule once a month could change how we think about delivering medication.'
