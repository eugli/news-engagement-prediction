The Lims who perished in the fire at their home in Jalan USJ 2/3, Subang Jaya, were “truly lovely”, saddened neighbours said. \nA day after the tragedy which stunned the entire neighbourhood, those living in the vicinity paid tribute to the Lim family. \nLim Ah Kok, 58, his wife Goh Bee Khim, 51, and their two sons Yong Liang, 20, and Yong Wei, 17, died in the blaze early Monday. \nHousewife La-ongdao Wong, 50, a close neighbour, said the family was ever willing to lend a helping hand to neighbours since moving in seven years ago. \n“Once, when my daughter's car broke down in SS14, Mr Lim came to help jumpstart the car. Another time, when we went to Penang for a holiday, they asked us over for a meal at their place in Butterworth,” she added. \nLa-ongdao’s son Wong Wern Chai, 17, recalled the many occasions when the family gave him a ride to tuition in Taipan. \n“Last year when I was warded with dengue fever over a week, they came to visit me in hospital ... I won't forget that,” he added. \nTheir immediate neighbour, who wished to be known as Che Puteh, 66, said the Lims “will be irreplaceable”. \n“When Goh sweeps the area in front of her house, she would do the same for mine too, although I kept telling her tak payah (no need to). \n“When my clothes are hung out to dry, she would shout out to me if it rained,” she added. \nChe Puteh said Goh would also sometimes help her water the plants in her garden. \n“It will be impossible to find neighbours like them,”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:24:46.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
