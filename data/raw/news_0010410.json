(Roberta Bell/CBC)\nGiven the political climate in the United States, where U.S. President Donald Trump's travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries has been stayed, and the fallout from a fatal shooting at Quebec City mosque, Sesink's gesture means a lot to Maseehuddin.\nU.S. judge temporarily blocks Trump's travel ban How Quebec City is mending the emotional scars left after the mosque attack \"I think it speaks to the strength of our friendship. It also speaks to the importance of building connections and building relationships when you're not at the crucible of a geopolitical or national crisis,\" Maseehuddin says.\n'I just began by saying hello' The two men first connected five years ago. They worked together to build an Islamic version of a Christian program to support young married couples.\n\"It means a lot to have a friend like Bev, but it also means a lot for a leader within a local church to extend his hand through the various resources that he has to not just myself and my family, but also our entire community,\" Maseehuddin says.\nSesink had been reading a book titled Muslims, Christians and Jesus by Carl Medearis when it dawned on him how little effort he had made to connect with people of different faiths in his diverse Mill Woods neighbourhood.\nHe contacted the Imam, the person who leads prayer, of the local mosque and began volunteering at nearby school. Slowly, he made his way into the community, unsure he could be a part of it.\nBev Sesink takes a cookie as he chats with young Muslim greeters at Tarjuma. (Roberta Bell/CBC)\n\"I just began by saying hello and noticed people were surprised,\" says Sesink, who has learned greetings in five different languages.\n'I refuse to be the silent majority.' - Bev Sesink \"People, they warm up, like they're going, 'Maybe I might be accepted.' So I've made a point to do that,\" he says. \"I refuse to be the silent majority that isn't affirming of those who are moving into our community or have been here for some time but still don't feel accepted.\"\nMaseehuddin says for some Muslims, that is an unfortunate reality.\n\"One thing that Muslims often say is that we just want people to know is that we are just people like everyone else,\" he says.\n\"Sometimes because we wear our faith on our sleeves, in some ways very visibly, it can be intimidating to get to know one another.\"\nAs Sesink and Maseehuddin have gotten to know one another, they've realized they are very similar. They're both husbands and fathers who want the best for the communities they serve.\n\"I think interfaith connection has to be personal if it's going to be real,\" Maseehuddin says.\n\"I think it extends beyond the shells of our faith or our identities as members of a particular faith tradition. It's getting to know one another as people.\"\n'What people all across Canada want to see' Sesink helps himself to a cup of coffee and a cookie as he converses with the Muslim teens manning the reception table.

That little plant may grow into a beautiful plant that gives people shade and gives people fruit. And the person has to have hope.\"\nThe relationship between Sesink and Maseehuddin gives hope to many of the young Muslims who know them, including Umaimah Usmani.\n\"I think that's what people all across Canada want to see. It's just the message of inclusiveness and peace and love and harmony,\" she says.\n\"I think it holds onto the Canadian values that this is a country where diversity is accepted and flourishes and where everybody should be able to practice what they believe in.\"\nUmaimah Usmani says the relationship between Bev Sesink and Farooq Maseehuddin embodies Canadian values. (Roberta Bell/CBC)\nUsmani, a dentist by trade who now has her hands full driving her three children to hockey, soccer and swimming lessons, makes time to come to Tarjuma every week.\n\"I think that's the message that the space gives out to people, that it's a wonderful space to connect, to grow spiritually, for your families to connect and it's a wonderful space for me to bring non-Muslim friends just to get a sense of what Muslim spaces look like.\"\nMaseehuddin says now more than ever before, that curiosity is there.\n'This is a time of a lot of loneliness.' - Farooq Maseehuddin \"Muslims are like anyone else. This is a time of a lot of loneliness,\" he says. \"All of us, whether you're Muslim or not, are looking for a sense of belonging, a place to connect.\n\"That's what Tarjuma is, it's a place for us to connect on a weekly basis with people that we know, but also to kind of open our arms to anyone who wants to show up and hang out and learn from the ancient traditions of Islam.\"\nroberta.bell@cbc.ca\n@roberta__bell", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/roberta__bell"], "published": "2017-02-06T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:29:21.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
