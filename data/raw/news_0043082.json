Tucker, according to Sean Deveney of the Sporting News. \n“Boston has expressed deep interest in Tucker ahead of the deadline, a source said,” Deveney wrote Sunday. “Get Tucker, and the Celtics can add depth without giving up on a potential No. 1 pick.” \nThe C’s have one of the deepest benches in the league. In fact, they played 11 guys in Thursday’s loss to the Chicago Bulls. Still, injuries to Avery Bradley and Jaylen Brown are a bit of a concern, and Tucker’s ability to defend the perimeter, rebound and provide scoring off the bench could prove to be valuable. \nThe 31-year-old veteran is averaging 7.0 points and 6.0 rebounds per game this season. Tucker is a free agent after this season, so acquiring him wouldn’t impact Boston’s summer plans for free agency. \nThumbnail photo via Justin Ford/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:42:17.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
