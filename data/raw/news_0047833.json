With this in mind, we wish to apologise to the people of Liverpool and the Hillsborough families for any offence caused and have done what we consider to be the only honourable thing we could do which was to resign and disassociate ourselves from Ukip. \n“I felt that supporting a libertarian party was the right thing to do in order to effect change within the political system in this country. \n“Unfortunately that dream has been shattered and the potential of Ukip has been squandered by people who have demonstrated they are not fit to lead at present.” \nWith just days to go until the Stoke by-election, Nuttall’s website is still offline for “scheduled maintenance”. \nThe Ukip leader’s press officer took the blame for the false statements posted on the site and offered her resignation. \nAt the party’s Spring conference on Friday, Nutall admitted it had “a tough week” but insisted he would not allow critics to “break me”. \nDuring the speech, Nuttall recieved a standing ovation when he said journalists had questioned whether he had “the support of my party”. \nAfter the speech, he refused to take questions from a group of journalists but said to the media scrum: “I have said absolutely everything I’ve got to say on the subject. I was at Hillsborough. I’ve got witness statements.” More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:43:40.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
