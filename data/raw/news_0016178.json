At this point of time there is no intention of compulsory acquisitions. \n\"If that's the tenor of the conversation then I'll be having further discussions back in Canberra. \n\"I'm wandering up there to try and see if we can get some sort of resolution. I'm not wandering up there for a jolly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:05:03.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
