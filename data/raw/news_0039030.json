For indirect sales where our products and services are sold through partners, final prices will continue to be determined by them.” \nFrom the Microsoft Store, the Surface Book now starts at £1,449, up £150 and 11.5% from £1,299 a week ago, while the top-end Surface Book now costs £400 more. While the starting price of the Surface Pro 4 remains at its original £749 mark, some models are up to £160 more expensive. \nMicrosoft is expected to release a new version of its tablet-first Surface Pro Windows 10 computer in the near future, although whether it will be more expensive than these post-Brexit referendum adjusted prices remains to be seen. \nThe Redmond, Washington-based company came out in favour of the UK staying within the EU in May 2016 and employs more than 5,000 people in the UK, working in partnership with around 25,000 British businesses. The company announced in October last year that it would be forced to increase the cost of its enterprise software and cloud services as the pound fell against the US dollar and the Euro. \nAmazon, one of Microsoft’s largest cloud services competitors, also increased the prices of its Amazon Web Services in the wake of the referendum.
