(Photo: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Netflix) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSo much for the early rumors. \nGeorge Clooney, who is expecting twins this June with his wife Amal, debunked recent headlines that they're having a boy and a girl. \n\"I don’t know where this rumor comes from that we’re going to have a boy and a girl. We ourselves don’t know yet and don’t want to know,\" he told the French outlet Paris Match (via People ) in a new interview. Reports: George and Amal Clooney are expecting twins \nHe's not alone: Stars including Gisele Bundchen , Victoria Beckham and recently, Natalie Portman , all claimed to have been kept in the dark on the sex of their children in utero. \nClooney did admit to new-dad nerves, though. “How can we not be anxious about this immense responsibility?” asked the star. “Bringing a child into this world … even two! We are very happy, very excited, but also a bit nervous, it’s normal.\" \nHe, and perhaps Amal, will make a red carpet appearance soon: Clooney will receive a career award at this year’s César ceremony (the French Oscars) on Friday. Matt Damon knew about Clooney twins for months \nAnd both he and Amal are taking extra precautions with two little ones on the way, Clooney added. \n“We decided to be much more responsible, to avoid the danger,” he said. “I won’t go to South Sudan any more or the Congo, Amal will no longer go to Iraq and she’ll avoid places where she knows she isn’t welcome.” CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2m5vAjw NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
