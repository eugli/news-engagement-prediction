Read More BEIJING: Foreign secretary S Jaishankar set the stage for the upcoming strategic dialogue in Beijing by saying that India remained \"strongly committed\" to maintaining good relations with China. India wants to maintain its ties with China without making any compromises on its stand on major issues of differences between the Himalayan neighbors. Jaishankar will attend the first round of the reconstituted strategic dialogue with China's executive vice foreign minister Zhang Yesui and other officials tomorrow. The two sides are geared up for tough negotiations covering several friction points affecting their relationship while making sure that the process of dialoge and consultations are not hampered. Two prickly issues that will come up during the first round of the upgraded strategic dialogue on Wednesday are China's negative stance towards India on the issue of Azhar Masood and entry into Nuclear Suppliers' Group . But Jaishankar has signalled India's determination to question certain aspects of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through the disputed Kashmir areas claimed by India. \"For us, there are questions of sovereignty which need to be addressed first,\" Jaishankar was quoted as saying by state-run Global Times in Beijing. New Delhi thinks that the corridor is an affornt on India's claim over Pakistan Occupied Kashmir through which it passes. Last Friday, Chinese foreign ministry set the bar high for Jaishankar on the issue of sanctioning the activities of Pakistan based terrorist, Azhar Masood. The ministry said China is opposing moves to sanction him during meetings of the sactions committee of United Nations Security Council because it has not yet received any \"solid evidence\" on Masood's role in terrorism. India holds the view that it has provided sufficient evidence about Masood's role in the Pathankot attack. But China remains unconvinced because it wants to stay on Pakistan's side, observers said. \"On terror, China has a very strong, principled position on counter-terrorism. We hope the position China already has will be further implemented,\" Jaishankar told Global Times in an interview before arriving in Beijing. The Indian foreign secretary met China's state councillor Yang Jiechi at the Zhongnanhai compound in central Beijing, which is filled with offices of senior leaders set around a scenic lake. He had arrived in Beijing with \"a very strong sense of commitment to maintaining our relationship,\" Jaishankar said. Jaishankar, who was India's ambassador in China till 2013, said his returning to Beijing was a sense of \"nostalgia and very good feelings\" about his time there. Yang said that India-China relations have seen \"positive growth\" in 2016, with President Pranab Mukherjee visiting China and Prime Minister Modi holding three meetings with President Xi Jinping. \"We enjoyed good communication at many levels and continued good cooperation in fields of economy, trade, culture and people to people exchanges,\" Yang said. India and China \"had been able to maintain sound economic and social development\" despite a \"fluid and complex\" global situation, he said. \"We truly hope that in the year ahead our two countries can enhance our exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation so that we can jointly contribute more to the peace, stability and development of our region and the world at large, and deliver more benefits to our two countries and the people of our two countries and the whole world,\" he said. Yang also thanked Jaishankar for his \"important contribution\" to relations with China both as envoy to China and foreign secretary.
