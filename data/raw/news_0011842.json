An investigation by American Humane determined the makers of \"A Dog's Purpose” did not mistreat animals on set following a questionable video. (Joe Lederer/Universal Pictures via AP) \nAmerican Humane — which is devoted to making sure animals are safe on movie sets — concluded that none of the animals in \"A Dog's Purpose\" ever faced any danger while working on the film. \n\"No animals were harmed in those scenes and numerous preventative safety measures were in place,\" the investigation found. \nAmerican Humane did contend, however, that \"the handling of the dog in the first scene in the video should have been gentler and signs of stress recognized earlier.\" \"A Dog’s Purpose” earned $18.4 million in its opening weekend, despite backlash stemming from the video.
