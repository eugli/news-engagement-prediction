Trump may even re-look the sanctions on Zimbabwe,\" Mugabe said. \nMugabe said former president Barack Obama's \"arrogance\" was the reason why Zimbabwe is still under targeted sanctions. \n\"We are now just under sanctions imposed not by Donald Trump but by Obama. What arrogance is that?\" \nHe said he agreed with Trump's stance of \"America for Americans\" saying it was also \"Zimbabwe for Zimbabweans\". \nThe US Congress passed the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act in 2001, effectively banning Mugabe and his allies from travelling to the US. \nSanctions were also passed on companies linked to his regime.
