And, even a month after the Klein Collins run-game coordinator and offensive line coach passed away due to complications from pancreatic cancer, everyone that knew him still speaks of him, frequently and fondly. \nHis funeral, held Thursday, Jan. 12 at Resurrection Lutheran Church in Spring, was packed to the rafters with coaches he worked alongside, young athletes he mentored, members of his church congregation and nearly uncountable other individuals who felt Scott had touched them in some way, made their lives better just by being part of it. \nSince Scott's diagnosis in 2015, the Klein and surrounding communities have mobilized, with individuals using the hashtag #CoachScottStrong on social media to show love and support. \nThe outpouring of sympathy and love near the end of Scott's life was enormous, but Klein Collins Football head coach Drew Svoboda said that the scale and intensity of the community's compassion was no surprise. If anything, it was a fraction of recompense for the passion and kindness he poured into the lives of others in his 25 years as a football coach, inspiring a sense of family or community everywhere he went. \n\"Everybody went through it with him,\" Svoboda said. \"I took him to the doctor the day he had cancer. It was me and him in a room. We all went through it with him, and that drew everybody even closer to him.\" \n\n'All in' \n\nIt's universally said that to know Coach Scott was to love him. Svoboda, along with men like Mike Troutman – who was elevated to Scott's position as offensive line coach last year when he became too ill to continue actively coaching – former Magnolia Football head coach Andy Sexton and former Galena Park ISD Athletic Director Ed Warken , insist that there was never a human being on earth that Scott could not engage, warm up to and befriend if given half a chance. \n\"If he was in a room at a coach's event, his personality was such to where he was going to talk to everyone in there before he left,\" Svoboda said. \"He never met a stranger. If you'd met him once, you remembered him.\" \nWarken, who retired this summer from the position of Cy-Fair ISD Athletic Director, was the first of the four men to encounter Jim Scott, who headed straight to Texas after graduating from Baker University in Baldwin City, Kansas. \nScott, who was an All-American offensive lineman for the Wildcats , had simply heard that Texas had the best high school football, and so Texas was where he wanted to be. Warken said that Scott had packed all of his belongings into his car and headed south, full of vim and vigor, ready to do whatever it took to earn his spot on a Texas coaching staff. \nWarken met Scott, and was immediately impressed, both by his generosity of spirit and his passion, underscored by the moment after the Galena Park ISD Athletic Director offered him a middle school coaching job, shook his hand and walked him to his car. \n\"I offered him a job,\" Warken said. \"We walked out to the back, and he had everything packed up in his car. Everything he owned was there, in the passenger seat and everything. He was all in.\" \n'All-in' is another common refrain when coaches and friends speak of Coach Scott. His entire life and career, Scott held nothing back in his mentorship and support of not just his athletes, his 'hogs,' as offensive linemen are often called, but his students in the history classes he taught, the sons and daughters of fellow coaches, even kids who – to any other man – might not mean much or inspire some kind of connection or intimacy. \nSexton, who hired Scott on as a Magnolia Football assistant coach from 2006-2011 said that Scott's ability to connect, even to the most difficult of players and children, was unique among all the coaches and people he has ever known. \n\"I've never met a guy with a bigger heart for kids than Coach Scott,\" Sexton said. \"There was never a kid he didn't believe in. As coaches, there's always kids that act up or do things, and we might push those kids away, but Jim never pushed a kid to the side.\" \nScott was 'all-in' not just in regards to football and winning games, but also in every facet of people's lives. Scott stayed in touch with the players and students he met and loved long after they had left his direct sphere of influence, just because he enjoyed knowing them and being a part of their journey. Many of them – too many to fit comfortably into the sanctuary – never forgot, and found their way back to Resurrection Lutheran as Scott's life and legacy were honored, says Sexton. \n\"In fact, he still had those relationships,\" Sexton said. \"At the funeral, there were kids I hadn't seen since 2006 that showed up. He's had that big an impact on those kids' lives.\" \nSvoboda agrees, unsure exactly of how to quantify or describe the enormity of the effect Scott had on the football program and the well-being of everyone fortunate enough to share even a few moments of time with him. \n\"He had a huge impact,\" Svoboda said. \"With the offensive line, for sure, but even with his students, kids at his church. He was just one of those that would ask about other stuff. To me, that's the measure of a good, effective coach – someone who knows what's going on in these kids' lives, truly developing a relationship with them.\" \n\n#CoachScottStrong \n\nThe best football teams 'play for one another.' That's how coaches describe the sort of communal, unified spirit that enables players to push each other, criticize, grow together and make each other better, as players and as young men, with everything they do. \nPlayers who play for themselves don't love one another enough to do that hard work of making one another better. When you play for the man besides you, you play harder, with more integrity, with the relentless, selfless will to elevate your teammate above yourself through preparation and teamwork. \nLast season, as Scott stepped down from his offensive line duties and Troutman took over, the Klein Collins Tigers posted the best season in school history, earning a 9-1 overall record (7-0 in 15-6A play) and knocking off Dekaney, Cedar Ridge, Tyler and Westfield as they advanced to the state semifinal round of the playoffs, primarily because of a punishing rushing attack that racked up 4,216 yards and 68 touchdowns over the course of 15 games. \nMuch credit is due the offensive line, certainly one of, if not the, best in the state last year. And the 'hogs,' along with the rest of the Tigers, were playing for Coach Scott last year. \nTroutman was the offensive line coach, but he will not accept a hint of credit or acclimation for the way his linemen established one of the state's most lethal and consistent rushing attacks. The Tigers averaged 7.2 yards a carry as a team, accounting for every player who carried the ball at any point, an astounding number that Troutman says speaks to Scott's influence and legacy. \n\"Coach Scott set the standard,\" Troutman said. \"He built that offensive line. All I did was come in and keep it rolling. The cornerstone, the philosophy, the attitude was all Coach Scott, the techniques, the mindset, everything. He was the rock.\" \nScott watched closely throughout the season, attending every game he could for as long as he could, though his illness grew to the point that he would be forced to leave at halftime of many games. Given that Klein Collins was routinely up by two, three, sometimes four scores at the recess, it was long enough to see where the games were going. \nTroutman said that, even in his darkest, sickest moments, Scott never forgot about the Tigers for a second. Troutman still has, and says he will forever have, the texts that Scott sent him about the team and the season towards the end. \n\"He kept up with [Klein Collins Football],\" Troutman said. \"He would always text me – and I saved all his last text messages – and say, 'you're the lifeline between me and the hogs.' He needed that.\" \nScott was involved, deeply engaged. It was just his nature. Troutman recalled an incident from the Bayou Bowl in 2016, the Houston high school summer all-star football game that served as one of the earliest moments in which Troutman began to assume Scott's full-time football responsibilities. \nTroutman told the East team's offensive line everything about Scott, trying to instill in them some knowledge of the man's character and legacy. After the game, Troutman insisted that Scott take a photo with the line, and it meant the world to Scott, whose health would decline rapidly starting around September. \n\"I think that meant a lot to him,\" Troutman said. \"He wasn't forgotten.\" \n\n'I want to be more like Jim Scott' \n\nIn the month since his passing, teachers, coaches, students, athletes, parents and fans have continued to pour out their support and love for Scott, voicing their memories and reflections on Twitter and Facebook, sharing recollections amongst themselves. His generous, selfless spirit lives on, and he is as little forgotten as he is much beloved. \nSvoboda believes that the sharing, the communal mélange of grief and celebration, would delight Scott. Though he never strove to be the center of attention, Scott would relish the thought that his impact was such that he is as oft-remembered and admired today as he was during his illness and before, when he was simply the largest, kindest man in every room he entered. \n\"He would absolutely love it,\" Svoboda said. \"He was a connected person. There was nothing cold about him, a very warm person. He was very sensitive, caring, had a big heart. Certain things meant a lot to him, and he was very appreciative.\" \nAll the people who knew Scott, and whose life trajectories he impacted – only ever positively – have found their own way to commemorate or celebrate him. For Troutman, that means emulating the man who taught him so much. \n\"You saw somebody that lived faith, family, football,\" Troutman said. \"You saw it in Jim Scott, in his faith, in his family in [the way he approached] football. With Jim, what I've taken from him is that he was real, nothing fake about him. I aim to want to be that way. I want to be more like Jim Scott.\" \n\n'On their own ' \n\nSadly, though fundraising efforts were very successful and active during the end of Scott's life, some of the furor seems to have died off since his passing. Though the Scott family – wife, Priscilla, also a Klein ISD educator, and children Hayden, Michelle and Lauren – maintains a GoFundMe page ( https://www.gofundme.com/coachjimscott ) to help defray the lingering medical bills and funeral costs, the hits and the contributions have slowed down considerably. \nThe tweeting and Facebook posts continue more or less unabated, but Svoboda says that it is all too easy for people to forget how much support is still needed. \n\"It's like anything,\" Svoboda said. \"There's so much support, and then whenever he dies, everyone goes away and reality sets in, and [his family is] kind of on their own.\" \nFor Svoboda, Troutman, Sexton, Warken, Scott's family, his former students and players, his fellow parishioners, the memory of Scott lives on, stronger than ever. They remember and honor him every time they adopt or emulate his character or passion. \n\n\"There is no knowledge so hard to acquire as the knowledge of how to live this life well and naturally.\" – Michel de Montaigne \n\nScott's legacy is not simply building an offensive line and run game that rivaled any in the state. His legacy is not just the passion for history or athleticism he inspired in the classrooms and gyms he occupied throughout his career. \nScott's real legacy is the many men and women still living that want nothing more than to be more like him, and share just a hint of his love and passion with the people they know. \nScott is gone now, but what survives is the infectious, contagious passion he inspired in everyone who met him, the knowledge of a life lived well that he shared freely with every person who crossed his path. \n\nThe Scott family's GoFundMe account, as of this writing, has generated $2,140 of the $50,000 needed to cover remaining expenses from his illness and funeral.
