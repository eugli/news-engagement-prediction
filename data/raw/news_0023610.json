And this time, the definition is far healthier.\nLow impact training, also known as the LIT Method , is a boutique fitness program founded by Norris and Gainor in Los Angeles. And now you can get the benefits of the popular workout wherever you are in the world, thanks to the 20-minute video above.\nAnd here’s the best part: The full-body routine gets your heart pumping, but stays gentle on the joints throughout. Don’t let Norris and Gainor’s easygoing demeanor fool you: You’ll be drenched in sweat by the end of it.\n“Just because it’s low impact doesn’t mean it has to be low intensity,” Norris said.\nThe routine incorporates two exercise bands and foam roller, but don’t worry if you don’t have the supplies. Norris and Gainor encourage you to follow the movements without the bands ― you’ll still get a great workout ― and you can simply stretch without a roller at the end.\nIf you knock this routine off your list once or twice a week and tack on a jog in between , you’ll be on the road to better health: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends adults perform two and half hours of moderate intensity exercise per week , or one hour and fifteen minutes of more vigorous activity instead.\nWhat are you waiting for?\nAlso on HuffPost More: Sleep + Wellness Fitness Workout Suggest a correction Comments Close SUBSCRIBE TO & FOLLOW LIFESTYLE HuffPost Lifestyle is a daily newsletter that will make you happier and healthier — one email at a time.
