Forbes estimates his fortune at a $120 million. Buffer can command as much as $65,000 per event to utter the phrase.\nIn fact every time the words are spoken, even if not by Buffer, he earns money from it. Buffer has a trademark on the phrase — which it turns out was all the idea of his manager, brother and UFC Octagon announcer Bruce Buffer.\nBruce was recently a guest on The Pony Hour podcast with comedian Tony Hinchcliffe and detailed the staggering fortune they’ve both made off the famous words.\n“He (Michael) didn’t so much as make a T-shirt off it,” Bruce explained. “I said ‘what are you doing, you need to do something’.\n“I trademarked the phrase, I made toys, I made the three Ready to Rumble boxing video games and the dream came true. We sold over $400 million in retail sales in products and ventures.”\nThe two brothers did not grow up together. They share a father but didn’t meet until Bruce was 30 years old and a successful businessman, who then sold his companies to link with Michael.\nMichael Buffer in action.

Michael in boxing, Bruce the UFC.\n“The trick is to make it look easy. I took the easy route, I went two words (“It’s Time”), Michael went five words,” Bruce revealed.\n“He does two HBO shows a month or more. He goes to Europe and gets paid ridiculous money.\n“My brother changed the face of announcing. Before him nobody paid attention, except for maybe Jimmy Lennon Senior. But nobody really paid attention to the ring announcer, he really developed his own style.”\nCompared to the fighters who will duke it out in the ring, Buffer comes out well ahead in the money stakes. Anthony Mundine is reportedly worth $30 million, although he admits much of that has been lost through poor investments and his own generosity. Danny Green is considered to also have a net worth of around $10 million.\nDanny Green and Anthony Mundine face off.

He fought in the US Navy during the Vietnam War and was a car salesman before turning to modelling at age 32. He didn’t become a ring announcer until the age of 38.\nAlthough he’s most famous for his work in the boxing ring, he does spread his wings far and wide — he’s been immortalised on The Simpsons, been featured on World Championship Wrestling and announced NBA, NHL and other sporting events.\nBuffer has worked some of the biggest fights in history and will add another to the list on Friday night at the Adelaide Oval.\nThe rematch between Mundine and Green has been met by some criticism, given the age of both men. But Buffer says the showdown is a must see for fight fans.\n“We’re talking about two fighters who are multiple world champions,” Buffer told Fox Sports 500 . “Both guys have this ability to reach down deep and they have the will to win and I think that’s what really makes fights compelling.\n“Everybody knows they’re both over 40, they’re both not in their prime, but they compete against each other and you know they’ve trained hard for this fight. They want to win.\n“It’s just compelling; it’s just something you want to see as fight fans.”\nBuffer is firmly sitting on the fence when it comes to the Mundine-Green rematch, giving this prediction. “Like Clubber Lang said in Rocky 3, (I predict) pain,” Buffer said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:47:22.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
