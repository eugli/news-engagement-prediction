He was no longer a reliable pass defender and only declined since his arrival as a free agent in 2014. But Jackson was still a factor at the point of attack, which is why he’s often been one of the NFL’s leading tacklers despite the lack of a dynamic defensive line in front of him. \nBut two things worked against Jackson: his age and his price tag. The 11-year veteran is 33 and was rapidly declining and was scheduled to earn $5.5 million in 2017. That sum included a $500,000 roster bonus that, according to his contract, was payable if he was on the Colts roster on the fifth day of the new league year (March 14). \nReleasing Jackson leaves them with little proven talent at inside linebacker. Last year's draft pick Antonio Morrison and former undrafted free agent Edwin Jackson are the only other viable options under contract. This pair struggled during D'Qwell Jackson’s PED suspension for the season’s final four weeks. \nThe release of Jackson frees up $5.5 million in cap space for a team that is going to have a sizable chunk of cash if it wants to be a player in free agency next month. The Colts have an estimated $56 million in cap space after this move. \nFollow Colts Insider Stephen Holder on Twitter: @HolderStephen. Releasing D'Qwell Jackson wasn't a tough call seeing the Colts need to get younger on D. But they still lack ILB athleticism IMO. — Stephen Holder (@HolderStephen) February 9, 2017 Antonio Morrison might be serviceable, but he's basically a poor man's D'Qwell Jackson right now. At least that's what I see. — Stephen Holder (@HolderStephen) February 9, 2017 Per @spotrac , after cutting Jackson #Colts will have north of $60M in cap room in 2017 — 7th most in the league. https://t.co/sSPIXDyiMj — Jim Ayello (@jamesayello) February 9, 2017 #Colts release D'Qwell Jackson today after 3 seasons in Indy.
