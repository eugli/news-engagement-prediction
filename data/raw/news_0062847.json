Goalkeeper Gianluigi ­Buffon , a World Cup winner with Italy who played for ­Ranieri for two years at ­Juventus, said: “It’s difficult to understand the decision.

I’m sure there will be no shortage of coaching jobs offered to him. \n“In the next few days and weeks as things calm down he will decide on what’s the best next step for himself and his family.” Buffon accepts that ­despite success in the ­Champions League, ­Ranieri was under pressure as City slid towards the ­relegation zone.
