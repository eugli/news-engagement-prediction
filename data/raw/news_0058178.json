They are among more than 3500 planets discovered beyond the solar system, or exoplanets. The Trappist-1 star has seven Earth-size planets orbiting it. This artist's concept appeared on the cover of the journal Nature on February 23, 2017. Illustration: NASA/JPL-Caltech \nResearchers have focused on finding Earth-sized rocky planets with the right temperatures so that water, if any exists, would be liquid, a condition believed to be necessary for life. Ad Feedback \nThe diameter of Trappist-1 is about 8 per cent of the sun's size. That makes its Earth-sized planets appear large as they parade past. \nFrom the vantage point of telescopes on Earth, the planets' motions regularly block out bits of the star's light. Scientists determined the system's architecture by studying these dips. TRAPPIST-1b and c receive the most light from the star and would be the warmest. TRAPPIST-1e, f and g all orbit in the habitable zone, the area where liquid water is most likely to be detected. TRAPPIST-1d is depicted with a narrow band of water near the terminator, the divide between a hot, dry day and an ice-covered night side. TRAPPIST-1e and TRAPPIST-1f are both shown covered in water, but with progressively larger ice caps on the night side. TRAPPIST-1g is portrayed with an atmosphere like Neptune's, although it is still a rocky world. TRAPPIST-1h, the farthest from the star, would be the coldest. Illustration: NASA/JPL-Caltech \n\"The data is really clear and unambiguous,\" Triaud wrote in an email. \nBecause Trappist-1 is so small and cool, its so-called \"habitable zone\" is very close to the star. Three planets are properly positioned for liquid water, said lead researcher Michael Gillon, with the University of Liege in Belgium. \nEven if the planets do not have life now, it could evolve. An artist's poster for Trappist-1e offers a heart-stopping view: brilliant objects in a red sky, looming like larger and smaller versions of our own moon. They are in fact planets. Illustration: NASA/JPL-Caltech \nTrappist-1 is at least 500 million years old, but has an estimated lifespan of 10 trillion years. \nThe sun, by comparison, is about halfway through its estimated 10-billion-year life. \nIn a few billion years, when the sun has run out of fuel and the solar system has ceased to exist, Trappist-1 will still be an infant star, astronomer IgnasSnellen, with the Netherlands' Leiden Observatory, wrote in a related essay in Nature. - Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:00:12.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
