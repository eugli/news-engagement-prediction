Giphy \nMy blonde locks are back to normal now, but I have a feeling that won’t last too long because a fascinating new hair dye is about to hit the shelves. \nIt’s unlike anything I’ve seen before because it changes colors with the temperature around you, Forbes reports. \nThe product is called “Fire,” and it’ll transform your hair color from black to red when you’re surrounded by heated temperatures, and red to black when you’re exposed to the cold. \nIf you don’t believe me, check it out for yourself. My mind is blown. \nFire_creative_concept_film from T H E U N S E E N on Vimeo . \nAs creepy as the dye looks, it’s undoubtedly innovative in the world of hair color, and I can’t wait to try a bottle out for myself. \nThe magical product was created by Lauren Bowker, founder of The Unseen . She considers herself a material alchemist and used thermochromic ink to construct the dye. Vimeo \nIt’s been reported thermochromic ink that could be bought off the shelves is harmful to the skin, so her team had to work on optimizing it so it could be safely used near the scalp. \nAfter ensuring the chemicals were safe, Bowker described the color-changing process and said, \nAbove a certain temperature, one of the molecule forms is more stable than the other, and so a reaction takes place producing a molecule with a slightly different absorption of light, and thus a different color. \nEssentially, the active part of the dye system is a complex carbon based molecule, which undergoes a reversible reaction with itself. Vimeo \nIn other words, your hairdo is about to become Mother Nature’s mood ring. \nBowker described her product as “magical,” stating, \nI really believe it’s a great example of a product that celebrates women in science and to encourage young females to see the opportunity for creativity within science and engineering — bringing sci-fi to real life. Vimeo \nTo make the product even better, it’s been assured the dye will come right out after a few washes and will not do permanent damage to your hair. \nIf you aren’t a fan of black or red, it’ll also be available in black to white, silver to powder blue, blue to white and black to yellow. \nBefore you run to the nearest beauty supply store, be aware the product isn’t available to buy yet. However, Bowker hopes to see it in stores by the end of 2017. 5 Decades Of Male And Female Beauty Trends On One Model To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
