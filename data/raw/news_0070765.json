Yet as the $555 million first phase nears completion, the Governor tells CBS2 that blowing up parts of the bridge is exactly what he’s going to do at some point this summer. \nThe governor says the demolition will save seven to nine months. \nWhen the project is completed in 2020, it will actually be two bridges connecting Brooklyn and Queens — one in each direction. Luckily for commuters, their relief comes in April because when the first bridge is done, traffic will be rerouted and the old bridge will go up in smoke. \n“Think of it from the commuter’s point of view,” the governor said. “Every day matters, so let’s find out a way to get it done.” \nCuomo has been on a rebuilding tear, from the new Tappan Zee Bridge, to new airports, to the new 2nd Avenue subway. But for him, this bridge is personal. As a kid, he drove over it with his dad — former Governor Mario Cuomo. Even then, he says, it was a nightmare. \n“He would bang the steering wheel because it was always packed,” he says, “it was always annoying.” \nChecking on the project with his team, the governor rattled off flaws in the old, rusting bridge — which was originally build for 10,000 cars, not the 185,000 that use it now — including the steep grade which is difficult for trucks to maneuver. \nWhile the debate on just how to pronounce “Kosciuszko” may continue for another 78 years, Cuomo says he’s keeping the old name with the new bridge. \nIn addition to alleviating congestion, the new bridge will also have LED lights so the colors can be changed for special events. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:18:47.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
