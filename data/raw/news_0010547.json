This building is going to be an amalgamation of utility and sustainability and if built to success then proving that architecture and clean environment can go hand in hand. \nThough the Nanjing Towers will be literally green, such green buildings can also look modern but be sustainable. Here are other seven such buildings from around the world that look absolutely attractive and serve the planet with clean air: 1. Manitoba Hydro Place in Winnipeg, Canada \nRobAid \nThis is one of North America's most energy-efficient offices with its geothermal system that naturally heats and cools the building. 2. World Trade Centre in Bahrain \nmapio \nThis is a 240-metre-high twin tower complex located in Manama, Bahrain. It uses wind turbines to optimise power outputs. The two towers are linked via three skybridges, each holding a 225 kW wind turbine, totalling to 675 kW of wind power capacity. The wind turbines are expected to provide 11% to 15% of the towers' total power consumption, or approximately 1.1 to 1.3 GWh a year. This is equivalent to providing the lighting for about 300 homes, 258 hospitals, 17 industrial plants, and 33 car engines. 3. Wat Pa Maha Chedi Kaew in Sisaket, Thailand \nburo247 \nAlso known as the Temple of a Million Bottles, is a Buddhist temple in Khun Han district of Sisaket province. In 2015, it was named one of the ten leading examples of sustainable architecture by travel website When on Earth . 4. ACROS Fukuoka Foundation Building in Fukuoka, Japan \nburo247 \nAt the time it was in 1995, the architecture, combining natural greenery and modern architecture, was way ahead of its time for the sustainable ethics it embodied. 5.
