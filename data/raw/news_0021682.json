Unclear \nMr Panneerselvam also said he was willing to withdraw his resignation \"if people wanted\". \nSome leaders of the AIADMK, who owe allegiance to Sasikala, have criticised Mr Panneerselvam's remarks and called him a \"betrayer\". \nReports say he will need the support of at least 118 of his party's 134 lawmakers if he wants to continue as the leader of the government. \nCorrespondents say it is unclear whether Mr Panneerselvam will be able to garner the requisite support, although many people in the state have opposed Ms Natarajan's elevation. \nTamil Nadu's main opposition DMK party also criticised the decision saying that \"the people of Tamil Nadu did not vote for anyone from Jayalalitha's household to become chief minister\". \nThe governor of Tamil Nadu will now have to take a call on whether to ask Mr Panneerselvam to show his support, or swear in Sasikala as the next chief minister. Image copyright AFP Image caption Sasikala was appointed as the general secretary of the party after Jayalalitha's death \nNever given any formal role by Jayalalitha in the party or the state government, Sasikala's role was always that of aide and confidante. \nBut analysts say her proximity to power allowed her and her extended family to wield huge influence in the party and the government. \nSasikala's influence over Jayalalitha also became the source of intense media speculation and tabloid gossip. \nThey also faced corruption charges together. A Karnataka high court order in 2015, which cleared them of involvement in a corruption scandal, paved the way for Jayalalitha's return to power after a setback in September 2014 when a trial court found them guilty of corruption. \nIndia's Supreme Court has heard an appeal in the case, and is expected to issue a verdict next week. \nIf convicted, Sasikala will not be allowed to hold public office for six years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T14:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T11:08:15.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
