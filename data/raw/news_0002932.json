Another blow for rural NB. #fibreglass #nbpoli\nâ€” @PamLynchMLA The vice-president said RPS Composites had to close its Minto plant because of a downturn in the fibreglass market, said Barton.\n\"They said all their feelers for 2017 are showing nothing for the Minto shop and 2018 is showing the same.\"\nThe employees were shocked.\n\"We knew things were slow at the plant,\" Barton said. \"I mean, we weren't doing any production at all. But in this industry, it was up and down. It was always feast or famine with us.\"\nThe plant has pulled through slow periods in the past and the staff were doing their part, he said. Already, they were working fewer hours as part of a work-share program \"to try to get through.\"\nNow, 32 unionized employees and eight other staff members will be without work as of March 10, three days before the plant closes.\nTheir severance pay started on Monday and is based on their respective years of service.\nClosure a 'devastating loss' Now, Barton says he doesn't know what the plant's employees will do in a rural part of the province where there aren't many jobs.\nHe said the company was one of the larger employers in the area and offered some of the higher-paying jobs. The plant employed people from Minto, Chipman and further afield.\n\"Speaking as a village councillor, this is a tremendous hit to our economy, with spinoffs going to the local businesses like the parts stores, the hardware stores, the restaurants. It's going to be felt throughout the whole community,\" Barton said.\n\"It's a devastating loss for the Minto-Chipman-Grand Lake area.\"\nPam Lynch, the MLA for Fredericton-Grand Lake, had a similar response.\n\"This will be devastating to the Community of Minto and another blow to rural New Brunswick,\" she said in an email.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/fibreglass?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/nbpoli?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/PamLynchMLA/status/826541331388444672"], "published": "2017-02-01T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:52:27.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
