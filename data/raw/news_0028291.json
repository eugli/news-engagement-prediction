Photo courtesy of PNP PIO \nMANILA, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP)’s Counter Intelligence Task Force , tasked to hunt down scalawags in the police force, nabbed two cops caught extorting P250 – that's hundreds, not thousands – from another cop who posed as a motorist. \nSenior Police Officer 1 Rodito Magluyan and Police Officer 3 Rowel Candelario, both from Station 9 of the Manila Police District (MPD), were arrested by CITF members and MPD operatives at around 3:50 am on Sunday, February 12. \nThe PNP said the two were caught demanding – and accepting – P250 in marked money from another cop who pretended to be a driver during an entrapment operation. \nEarlier, the task force had gotten a complaint via SMS about cops flagging down motorists and extorting money from them. The two were caught in the vicinity of Quirino Avenue corner Mother Ignacia Street in Malate, Manila. \nThe two were brought to the Manila Prosecutor’s office the same day. Assistant City Prosecutor Reynaldo P. Tomas Jr. recommended the filing of information for the crime of robbery/extortion. \nBoth cops are currently detained the CITF headquarters inside Camp Crame as the case is ongoing. \nThe CITF was formed late January following the PNP’s pullout from President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs. \nDuterte then said the PNP was “corrupt to the core” after it was revealed that anti-illegal drug police supposedly orchestrated the kidnap and murder of a South Korean businessman. \nThe PNP was ordered to focus on “internal cleansing” or ridding its ranks of corrupt cops. \nSince it was launched, the CITF has gotten more than 1,000 text messages reporting supposed cases of scalawag cops. \nThose with complaints may text 09989702286 or ‎09957952569, the CITF hotlines.
