But here lately, as UK finds its way out of a midseason slump, they’ve just been all over the place. \n“It's all over the board a little bit right now,” Kentucky assistant coach Kenny Payne said Monday. “But now is the time where we need to become more consistent.” \nHis sentiments echo his boss. \n“We’re consistently trying to figure things out,” coach John Calipari said. “There are times I think we’ve figured it out, and then there are other times I look and I’m like, ‘We haven’t.’ But we’re one of those teams with an enormous upside, even now.” \nEarly in SEC play, Kentucky beat Ole Miss by 23, Texas A&M by 42, Arkansas by 26, Auburn by 20 and South Carolina by 16. But then UK lost three out of four games. The Wildcats bounced back with a current four-game win streak, but all but one has been a nail-biter. \n“We need to play with great energy every single night,” Payne said. “We need to defend the ball, on-ball defense, gotta be better, and in spurts it has been good. We need to be consistent. Ball screen defense has to be better. It's not just the guard, it's the big as well.” \nEnergy, Payne said, comes from confidence. \n“We need every one of these guys to play with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable confidence, and be efficient,” Payne said. “And the only way you really can get that is if it’s not on one player. That’s why we’re emphasizing sharing the ball. I heard (Tennessee coach) Rick Barnes talk about, ‘We’re going to take the four-man away.’ Well, if the ball is moving and it’s going pass, pass, pass, drive, kick, you’re not taking anybody away. They all can make plays.” \nAnd confidence comes from honing one’s craft. \n“That confidence comes from being in the gym, having the mental toughness to execute what we have practiced and then doing it in the game,” Payne said. \nHe then used sophomore guard Isaiah Briscoe as a case in point. Interestingly, Briscoe walked by just as Payne was making his point on Monday so he stopped to listen. \n“For example, if Isaiah shoots the ball and none of his family members believe that shot is going in and he shoots it like he doesn’t believe it’s going in, he’s running. So, he better believe 100 percent that he’s making that shot. That’s a layup, that’s a jump shot, that’s a free throw, that’s defensive confidence. Whatever it is, he better do it with confidence.” \nPayne uses running sprints to build confidence. NBA players react to DeMarcus Cousins being traded by the Kings Start SlideShow \n“They know that I’m watching,” he said. “The last game, as soon as the game was over, Wenyen Gabriel said, ‘What time to I have to run tomorrow?’ If you’re not on that floor playing with confidence, I’m running you. It’s that simple. They know.” Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:12:23.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
