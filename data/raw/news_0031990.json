Advertisement \n\"At a party last night, a Times reporter who does not cover Washington or politics, referred to an unfounded rumour regarding Melania Trump,\" the newspaper said in a statement. \"The comment was not intended to be public, but it was nonetheless completely inappropriate and should not have occurred. Editors have talked to the reporter in question about the lapse.\" \nThe rumour in question is that Melania Trump was once a high-class escort (an allegation that has landed the Daily Mail in court because apparently it cost Mrs Trump some very important business dealings ). \nFirstly, this is a lesson in not saying out loud every awful opinion you've ever had, as Emily Ratajkowski might be listening. But mostly, it's a lesson on not casually demeaning women, and also, not using sex work as an insult. \"Hooker\" and \"prostitute\" are outdated terms that are offensive to sex workers. \nAs has been discussed, Melania Trump probably doesn't need or deserve our sympathy (no matter how many grimaces she pulls when in proximity to her husband, or times that she is left holding a Tiffany box that nobody knows what to do with ). But Ratajkowski's point is about all women who are stereotyped, sexualised or summed up by their history (whether true, made-up or projected). \nAs Ratajkowski said to Glamour magazine in an interview last year on sexuality and 'attention seeking,' \"It's not our responsibility to change the way we are seen – it's society's responsibility to change the way it sees us.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:24:05.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
