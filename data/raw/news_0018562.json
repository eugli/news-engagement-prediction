FAILED COMEBACK \nShe failed. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Article continues below Watch: Joe Hart concedes one of the most bizarre goals of his career v Empoli \nWhatever she chooses to do, it leads many to believe that her days in the Octagon are over, something UFC president Dana White has also reiterated. \nHowever, her first conqueror – who battles Germaine de Randamie for the new women’s featherweight crown at UFC 208 – doesn’t believe Rousey will remain retired for too long if she has decided to call it quits, and suggests it’ll just be called time off. TIME OFF \nSpeaking to Rolling Stone , Holm said: “I can never say I think a fighter should retire. \n“I have a friend of mine that fought professionally in boxing and in MMA, and she’s retired three times and only then did it stick. \n“Ronda might be done, but she really accomplished a lot. She might feel like, ‘You know what, I did a lot in this sport, I’m a legend in the sport. I can hang up my gloves.’ \n“She might think that and say she’s retired, but then in two years, she might think, ‘I’ve had enough of this other life. Fighting is what I want to do again.’ \n“It’s a thin line. I’ve seen fighters retire multiple times. \n“It’s not really a retirement. It’s just time off.” \nWhile there’s been no official announcement on her end, it’ll be even tougher to come back from her latest setback. \nPlus, the longer she waits, the more pressure she adds on herself, but it could be time to prepare for a women's bantamweight division without the woman who put the female athletes on the map. \nWill Ronda Rousey retire from MMA for good? Or will she just take some more time off? Have YOUR say in the comments section below. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
