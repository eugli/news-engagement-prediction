Whatever he said was sure to steal headlines, so deflecting was a savvy move on Westbrook’s part.\nThe first person to get Westbrook to respond earnestly to a question about Durant was none other than young New Orleans Saints superfan Jarrius Robertson , who had this blunt exchange with Russ:\nRobertson : “I give all my props to you, because KD shouldn’t have left you guys and you would’ve had a chance of making the playoffs.”\nWestbrook : “We’re going to make the playoffs.”\nRobertson : “You need some more shooters, though.”\nWestbrook : “You wanna play with us?”\nThe only time a reporter got Westbrook to respond with anything other than some clothing brand recommendations was when somebody asked if he and the Thunder have moved on from Durant:\nRussell Westbrook was asked if he and his team have moved on from Kevin Durant…Gives a strong answer. pic.twitter.com/tfqvBgcOG4\n— Def Pen Hoops (@DefPenHoops) February 17, 2017\n“What does it look like?” said Westbrook. “That’s y’all problem. I don’t know what y’all need, but I’m in a great place, I’m happy, I’m having fun, having a great time, and I’m happy with my team I have now.”\nNothing to see here, folks. We’ll have to wait for the drama of Westbrook and Durant potentially sharing the floor together again as teammates when the All-Star Game tips off on Sunday night.\n– – – – – – –\nBen Rohrbach is a contributor for Ball Don’t Lie and Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports.
