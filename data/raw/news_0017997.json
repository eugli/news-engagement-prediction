To mark the new milestone, the company released its version nine update which comes with some amazing new features. \nOne of the new features on the new update is Nairabox food which users can use to order food from their favourite restaurants or bukas and have it delivered to their doorsteps. For every transaction done on the app, users get cash and loyalty points. \nThe second feature is for the cinema lovers as they can now watch movie trailers on the app which gives them an idea of what movies to choose before purchasing their tickets. The App also launched the first cinema self-service device in West Africa. The first cinema self-service is an interactive kiosk that allows users scan and redeem their tickets without the need of an attendant, making ticket redemption swift and allowing users jump the queue quickly without hassles.
