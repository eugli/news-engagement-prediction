Europe sees sudden RADIATION SPIKE – is nuclear testing from RUSSIA to blame? A RECENT radiation spike in Europe has left scientists stumped for an explanation, but some believe that Russia could be conducting secret nuclear testing. PUBLISHED: 16:10,   16:16, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 GETTY Europe has seen a sudden spike in radiation levels \nEurope has seen an unexpected rise in radiation levels, leaving scientists baffled to explain the sudden hike. \nAn increase in the radioactive Iodine-131 was first detected over the Russia-Norway border in January, but that spike has since made its way across Europe. \nThe increase was then noticed in Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Germany, France and Spain but authorities decided to keep the information private as they believed it “had no news value”, according to the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA). \nFrance’s nuclear safety authority the IRSN added that the spike of Iodine-131 raised \"no health concerns” and the levels have since gone back to normal. Related articles GETTY There has been a spike in Iodine-131 \nScientists have struggled to explain the phenomenon, but some believe that nuclear testing from Russia could have played its part. \nIodine-131 has a half-life of just eight days, so any detection is proof of a sudden and recent release of the radioactive chemical. \nTheories have begun to circulate that Russia is testing nuclear weapons in the Arctic circle as Iodine-131 is a radioisotope found in the atomic bombs tested by the US and Russia in the early days of the Cold War. GETTY Has Putin been testing his nukes? \nSwedish website Cornucopia wrote that Iodine-131 “is an isotope that occurs upon detonation of uranium-235 or plutonium-based nuclear weapons.” \nIt added: “Russia is upgrading its nuclear weapons to the new state of the art robots and it is not unreasonable that, in so doing, to develop new warheads and not just carriers.” \nThe theory gathered momentum when the US Air Force deployed its WC-135 nuclear explosion 'sniffer' aircraft in a bid to track down the source. GETTY Some believe that nuclear testing is to blame \nHowever, scientists state that no other radioactive chemicals were detected which seemingly rules out the possibility of nuclear weapon testing. \nThe most likely source is a pharmaceutical accident.
