In true Jason Bourne fashion, Damon expertly navigated the trap question and escaped without betraying his friend Ben Affleck.\n“I have it on good authority that Will is actually Ben’s favorite Batman,” Damon said. “We’re all fans of Lego Batman . I went this last weekend with my kids, and it’s just awesome.”\nDamon also had an amusing anecdote about Affleck’s son, Sam, which Ben first shared with The New York Times last year. When Affleck first took the role of Batman, Sam really believed that he was Batman, and the FedEx guy was The Joker.\n“Sam was convinced was that the FedEx guy was the Joker, because it’s the same colors, the green and the purple,” Damon said “So whenever the FedEx guy comes, which is often, because they get packages and scripts, it’s, ‘Dad, dad, Joker. Joker. It’s the Joker.’ Ben is literally on a first-name basis with this guy because he went out on the first day and was like, ‘I’ll give you 20 bucks if we pretend to fight. My kid thinks you’re the Joker.”", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZW1QCnlA6Qc?feature=oembed"], "published": "2017-02-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T22:32:52.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
