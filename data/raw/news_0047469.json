Officials have seen enough success with four golden eagles to begin designing specially made Kevlar mittens to protect their talons. \n“The cost is very low considering the job at hand,” an officer told Agence France-Presse on Monday. \nSEE ALSO: Eiffel Tower needs $22M ‘aesthetic perimeter’ to protect against terrorism threat \nFalconer Gerald Machoukow told the news outlet that the birds — D’Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis — started out early in life by receiving food on inoperable drones. Their instincts, coupled with regular training and positive reinforcement, took care of the rest. \n“I love these birds. I don’t want to send them to their death,” Mr. Machoukow said about the need for Kevlar mittens. \nMilitary officials told AFP that a midterm progress report on the 24-month project will be made in June. \nFour more eagles are expected to begin training by later this summer. \nEach bird can reach speeds of 50 miles per hour and spot targets over 1 mile away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:48:38.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
