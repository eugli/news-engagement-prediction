By the time of The Salesman' s win, Williams and Hedges had already lost to Viola Davis and Mahershala Ali, respectively. \nNetflix, meanwhile, went into Sunday's show with three Oscar nominations: best documentary ( 13th ) and documentary short ( The White Helmets and Extremis ). 13th lost the best documentary award to O.J.: Made in America . \nWhile Netflix became the first high-profile streaming service to land an Oscar nomination with The Square , it's yet to land one for a feature film. \nAmazon Studios released its first awards-hopeful movie at the end of 2015 with Spike Lee's Chi-Raq and over the past year has spent aggressively to become a serious player in the indie film world. \nWhile both Netflix and Amazon are willing to spend big for prestigious titles, the latter is also willing to let films have a full theatrical run before becoming available at home, an appealing prospect for filmmakers and production companies as it also doesn't ruffle exhibitors' feathers. \nOscars host Jimmy Kimmel referenced Amazon's best picture nomination for Manchester in his opening monologue. With the camera filming Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in the audience, Kimmel joked if Bezos wins, his Oscar will arrive in two to four business days and might be stolen by a GrubHub delivery guy.
