The exemptions apply to both new applicants and those who are currently in the U.S. and wish to transfer to the U of A.\nApplying for admission at the U of A can cost more than $125.\n\"The University of Alberta is — and will remain — an open and welcoming community to people from every nation and religion in the world,\" university president David Turpin said in a statement\n\"I want to assure our students, post-doctoral fellows, faculty, staff, and applicants who are citizens or dual-citizens of the countries currently banned entry to the United States that the University of Alberta stands with you. We will do everything we can to support you during this period of uncertainty.\"\nAlberta politicians tweet support for refugees in wake of U.S. travel ban\n'I was shocked': Edmonton mother fears daughter is stuck in U.S.\nThe university has established a new website that offers resources and information to those who may be affected.

But we do so today because of the real impediment this new executive order poses to the free flow of people and ideas and to the values of diversity, inclusion and openness that are hallmarks of a strong and healthy society.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.ualberta.ca/travel-ban-information", "http://www.studyincanada.ualberta.ca/HowToApply/Undergraduate.aspx"], "published": "2017-02-03T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:56:55.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
