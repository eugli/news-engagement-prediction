The Golden Gate Bridge would not be part of the toll increase. \nOfficials are still haggling over the exact amount, but the upper range would boost the top cost of crossing the Bay in a car to $9. \nBART says what it needs most is 306 additional railcars. There is no money in Measure RR, a $3.5 billion maintenance bond passed by voters last year, to pay for them. \nNew train cars will cost a lot of cash, $1.6 billion, to be exact. \nThe transit agency hopes $1 billion of that will come from the envisioned toll-increase measure, which would still leave it $600 million short of what it needs for all the cars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:24:47.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
