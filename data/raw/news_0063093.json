Pregnant Cheryl seeks baby advice from Kourtney Kardashian \nWhile the 33-year-old has been relatively coy about officially announcing her pregnancy with One Direction’s Liam Payne, it seems Cheryl has now pulled back the curtain on her baby bump. \nShe’s previously been sighted wearing specific dresses to seemingly shield her pregnancy , but in this latest shot she can be seen cradling the bump from a side-on perspective. Cheryl’s baby bump features in a new L’Oreal campaign shot (Picture: PA) \nElsewhere in the photo, Dame Helen Mirren, Louisa Johnson, Katie Piper and Gary Thompson are also pictured. \nThe campaign is a three-year collaboration between The Prince’s Trust and L’Oreal Paris titled All Worth It, which aims to help raise the confidence of 10,000 young people across the UK. \nSpeaking about the campaign, Cheryl said: ‘As a long-standing supporter of The Prince’s Trust and spokesperson for L’Oreal Paris I am so happy to support this partnership. Dame Helen Mirren and Katie Piper also feature in the campaign (Picture: PA) \n‘Young people are currently facing more and more problems with self-confidence and we have to address these issues as a real priority.
