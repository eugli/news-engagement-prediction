It comes as MPs hit out against a potential 'bend it for Beckham' rule for the rich and famous amid claims the former footballer was advised by Whitehall on how to fit the Knighthood criteria. Not hiding: Victoria was seen jetting out of the UK as the storm began to swirl over her husband's clean-cut image and she has now emerged heading to business meetings in New York Seeing red: The mum-of-four was seen looking furious as she strutted the pavement into an office Bright spark: However, rather than going for a subtle look to avoid attention, the fashion designer went all out to turn heads Fitting: The colour of her outfit no doubt reflected her mood following her husband's leaked emails Mixing it up: Victoria has been experimenting with bold colours as of late and this could have been her most vibrant display to date Walking tall: The designer strutted her stuff on in brown leather stilettos with a chrome heel The politicians said today that celebrities should be treated no differently to ordinary members of the public when it comes to taxes and the honours systems. The comments come amid reports that Beckham was on the verge of becoming Sir David in 2014 until a last-minute 'red flag' intervention from HMRC due to his involvement in an alleged tax avoidance scheme. Insiders confirmed there was effectively then horse-trading between a Whitehall committee and the superstar's advisers to 'sort out' the issues raised by HMRC. Rosena Allin-Khan, Labour’s shadow culture minister, today said it was 'incredibly wrong' while Lib Dem MP John Pugh, a member of the influential Public Accounts Committee, said the same rules should apply for everyone. Beckham and his PR machine have been left reeling after Friday's release of 18.6million emails and documents hacked by the Football Leaks website from the servers of Doyen Global, the firm run by the ex-footballer's PR chief Simon Oliveira. According to the revelations, the Honours Committee had already agreed that Beckham's nomination – almost certainly proposed by his PR advisers – was well 'merited' before a routine check of his tax affairs. The leaked emails also include a number of bombshells and series of sweary-rants and may even have been used as part of a £1million blackmail plot. In one message the ex-England captain allegedly claims singer Katherine Jenkins, 36, got an OBE for ‘singing at the rugby and going to see the troops plus taking coke. F g joke’. Off the cuff: Victoria was dressed in head-to-toe in a bright red ribbed wool two piece from her own collection, over a clashing blue shirt Lots to work on: The brunette kept a very stern face as she made her way into the meeting Walk of defamed: Victoria strutted up the steps after getting out of her car Flying solo: Seemingly alone, the former Spice Girl remained stern-faced until she was in the building Watch out: The star has had several days to process the leak and who it could have come from Defiant: Victoria hid her eyes behind her stylish thick-rimmed shades Not all doom and gloom: Unlike David, Victoria was no doubt pleased with the New Year's honours list having been made an OBE On Saturday, 42-year-old Victoria was seen rushing through the terminal at Heathrow with her guard staying close to her side after the revelation. Keeping her head down, the former Spice Girls star donned a camel coat to catch her flight. Her trademark VB phonecase was seen as she kept her mobile glued to her hand for the journey. The security guard kept a hand on her shoulder as she left her car and headed into the airport. Her outing comes after David, 41, allegedly wrote an explicit email to his PR manager, Simon Oliveria, to say it was a 'f joke' that singer Katherine Jenkins was awarded an OBE. Hurried through: On Saturday, Victoriawas seen being rushed through London's Heathrow airport United: Her outing comes after David, 41, allegedly wrote an explicit email to his PR manager, Simon Oliveria, to say it was a 'f joke' that singer Katherine Jenkins was awarded an OBE He allegedly wrote the private message after he missed out on a knighthood, while other emails are said to show him call the honours committee 'unappreciative c****. But it now seems the former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder could have been a victim of a targeted blackmail plot. The emails were passed to the Football Leaks website after the firm run by his advisers refused to pay the hackers, reports Tom Bryant at the Daily Mirror . Always on call: Her trademark VB phonecase was seen as she kept her mobile glued to her hand for the journey A source told the newspaper that Beckham - who earned 115 caps playing for England - was simply 'caught in the crossfire'. The messages were reportedly accessed after criminals - thought to be using Russian servers - hacked documents from the sports agency run by Mr Oliveria. They demanded one million euros - almost £900,000 - or they would pass on the material they had acquired, according to the Mirror. Rushing through: The 42-year-old designer was seen rushing through the terminal with her guard staying close to her side after the revelation The hackers went to Doyen Sports, which are part of Mr Oliveria's Doyen Global agency based in Portugal. They sent an email and attempted to 'blackmail' the business team - who called the police at the beginning of 2016. A source told the paper: 'They said we have all this information and you have to pay up. It was blackmail, pure and simple. 'The investigation has been going on behind the scenes for some time and involved several prominent companies. 'The hack wasn't targeted at David at all – it was very much a fishing expedition but David has been caught in the crossfire.' Off she goes: Keeping her head down, the former Spice Girls star donned a camel coat to catch her flight The alleged blackmailer used the name Artem Lovuzov and said the leak is 'a lot bigger' than they imagined when he contacted Doyen Sports. And after not receiving a reply they allegedly passed it on to Football Leaks, who deny blackmailing Doyen Sports. The emails, which were allegedly written by Beckham, were then leaked and appeared to show him refuse to give $1million to a UNICEF event - allegedly writing 'it's my f money'. Beckileaks: David allegedly wrote the private message after he missed out on a knighthood, while other emails are said to show him call the honours committee 'unappreciative c****' Victims? It now seems the former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder could have been a victim of a targeted blackmail plot It comes as Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins hit back at Beckham after he allegedly branded her OBE award a 'f joke'. She was given an OBE in the 2014 New Year Honours for her services to music and charity. Her manager, Professor Jonathan Shalit, told Dan Wootton at The Sun that she deserved her award for her charity work and music career. A spokesman for Beckham said: 'This story is based on outdated material taken out of context from hacked and doctored private emails from a third party server and gives a deliberately inaccurate picture.'
