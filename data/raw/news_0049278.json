Dan Sarginson and Jordan Turner have both come out this season, while Joe Greenwood is on his way after signing a three-year deal with the Gold Coast. St Helens forward Joe Greenwood is joining the Titans immediately.

I think a lot more want to come over and play in this competition. I don’t want to slag Super League off, but the NRL is the best competition in the world. \n“Week in, week out you’re up against tough opponents so I think there will be a lot of players want to come out and test themselves.” \nWhitehead arrived at the Raiders as a relative unknown, but proved to be one of the buys of the season in 2016. \nHe featured in every game for the Green Machine, missing just two minutes of game time all season. \nThe 27-year-old believes there are a host of other Englishmen who could make a similar impact. \n“There’s a lot of players who I reckon could come out and do the job as well, people like Kallum Watkins at Leeds, (Castleford’s) Luke Gale and (Wigan’s) John Bateman,” Whitehead said. \n“They’re the types of players I reckon who could come over and do a great job.” \nDo you live in Queensland?
