We were also treated a feature showing what the folks at Marvel Studios have up their sleeves as the Marvel Cinematic Universe progresses through Phase 3. \nIn the feature, we saw several behind the scenes stills from the set of Thor: Ragnarok and judging for the stills alone, the third solo film featuring the Asgardian demigod is going to be different than any movie we’ve seen before. (Photo: Marvel Entertainment) \nWe know the Thor Odinson has managed to get imprisoned somewhere on the opposite side of the universe on his quest to find out all he can about the Infinity Stones the MCU has revolved around. We also know that he’ll have to battle the Hulk in a Planet Hulk-like gladiator battle. \nBut as MCU Exchange pointed out, the aliens we see in the behind the scenes shot seem to come from a place beyond the Nine Realms. Asgard is based around Norse mythology so it vastly resembles a Vikings-based culture rather than that of a tradition alien culture. \nThe otherworldly-beings we see resemble those that we’d see in a Star Wars movie or better yet, residents on a planet that a certain Guardians of the Galaxy group would visit. (Photo: Marvel Entertainment) \nWhat do you think? After they fight, where do you think Thor and the Hulk will stop in their jouorney around the galaxy as they work to stop Hela, the Asgardians god of Death, from destroying the universe? As these behind the scenes photos continue to surface, we’ll assemble them in the gallery below. \nIn Thor: Ragnarok , Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is imprisoned on the other side of the universe without his mighty hammer and finds himself in a race against time to get back to Asgard to stop Ragnarok – the destruction of his homeworld and the end of Asgardian civilization – at the hands of an all-powerful new threat, the ruthless Hela (Cate Blanchett). But first he must survive a deadly gladatorial contest that pits him against his former ally and fellow Avenger – The Incredible Hulk!” \nMORE THOR: Hulk vs Thor Concept Art / Concept Art of Cate Blanchett's Hela / Thor Ragnarok: Who Is Hela? / 5 Planet Hulk Easter Eggs We Need in Ragn arok \nThor: Ragnarok , the third installment of Marvel’s popular Norse Super Hero, is directed by filmmaker Taika Waititi.
