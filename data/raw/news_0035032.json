NEW WWE CHAMPION \nIt seems like WWE and Hollywood royalty knew what was happening on the night too. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Article continues below \nFirst, Wyatt posted a picture of himself with his first-ever WWE title, with the simple caption ‘#EraOfWyatt.’ ERA OF WYATT \nThe Rock then responded directly to him, and it sounded like even he thought it was about time he was given the recognition many believe he deserves. \nHe posted: “Hell yes. Big fan of his talent and couldn’t happen to a better dude. Welcome to the club, enjoy the ride and have fun! Congrats brother.” \nDespite the kind gesture, his fans were divided on what he posted. \nMost seemed to be happy with the fact that he was putting over a future star, especially on a huge platform where he has over 10 million followers. \nOn the other hand, many were hitting out at him for ‘burying’ him in a lengthy promo at WrestleMania 32 last year, which is strange as he clearly told Bray he had the ability and the charisma to go all the way. \nIn fact, Vince McMahon probably wouldn't be too pleased about what The Rock tweeted out either. \nWhile it would seem like innocent praise for a star, he's still a heel that Vince is trying to build SmackDown Live around, especially now that he's champion. \nEither way, it's not only great to see legends praise the stars of today, but Rock sounds like a genuine fan of somebody that has suffered from bad booking. \nWhat do you make of The Rock’s message to Bray Wyatt?
