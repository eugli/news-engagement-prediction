Image caption Pop-up vets clinics have been performing neutering operations at wildcat sites \nDr Langridge added: \"We don't have any illusions that this is a very ambitious project. \n\"We have very high targets. To be effective, 'track, neuter, release' needs to get 75% of the feral cat population so we need the public's help.\" \nAbout 150 cameras, which are triggered by heat and movement, have been gathering images of both feral and wildcats. \nOnly three wildcats on Morvern have been captured on film. \nBut the team have also been asking for local knowledge about the locations of feral cats. \nThat data has allowed them to lay targeted traps to catch specific animals which live close to wildcats. \nWildcat officer Emma Rawling brought a feral tabby to the pop-up clinic. \nShe said: \"Judging by the markings patterns and the overall physique of the cat, it's definitely a cat of domestic origin, it's got what we call a marble tabby pattern. \n\"But the scary thing is it was living right next to a really good wildcat so it was a really important one to get caught and neutered.\" Image caption About 150 camera traps have been laid around Morvern to better understand the animalsâ€™ movements \nVet Alice Bacon, from Dingwall, is one of the vets who has been performing the operations. \nShe said: \"We know that domestic cats, feral and pet domestic cats, are now the major threat to wildcats because of hybridisation and disease control so without reducing the population of entire feral cats we'll be unable to secure a future for Scottish wildcats.\" \nThe landscape at Morvern, with plenty of ground cover, is ideal territory for wildcats. \nIt is one of six priority areas where SWA has been intensively studying the populations and trying to protect them. \nFew of us may have seen these animals in the flesh, but they remain an iconic Scottish species whose continued existence is far from guaranteed.
