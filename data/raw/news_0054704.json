By August, it had still not been moved and the council stepped in to remove it.\nModen failed to attend Bolton Magistrates Court last week to answer to the charges and the matter was proved in her absence.\nShe was found guilty of failing to comply with an abatement notice and was fined £440. She must also pay court costs of £266 and a £44 surcharge.\nA further £514.22, which is how much it cost the council to get rid of the rubbish bags, will also be recovered from Moden.\nBolton council’s cabinet member for housing, Coun Elaine Sherrington, said:\nThere is simply no excuse for dumping rubbish in this way and these cases show how the actions of one or two residents can affect an entire community.\n– Coun Elaine Sherrington Carmen Baker, of Brandwood Street, Rumworth has also been fined as part of Bolton Council’s ongoing crackdown on rubbish and fly-tipping.\nThe 45-year-old dumped several bags of rubbish, carpet oddments, furnishings, and a sofa bed in the rear yard of her rented house. She too ignored several warnings and the council ended up removing the rubbish itself.\nBaker was fined £440, in her absence, and ordered to pay court costs of £245 and a victim surcharge of £44. Clean up costs will be recovered from Baker as well.\n“We gave both occupiers numerous chances to sort this out and co-operate with us but they took no action. We have also contacted the landlords of these properties to make them aware of the issues.\nWe are grateful to the public for being vigilant and reporting these cases to us. We will prosecute when requests and warnings are ignored.\n– Coun Elaine Sherrington Complaints about waste on private land, including properties, should be referred to the council’s Housing Standards team on 01204 336500.\nLast updated Tue 21 Feb 2017 Environment Bolton", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:55:26.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
