This move, like most franchise tag decisions, wasn’t unexpected. \nLast week, La Canfora estimated that there was a 75 percent chance the Chargers would tag Ingram. If he had hit the open market, he likely would’ve landed a monster contract given his productivity (18.5 sacks in the past two seasons) and his age (27). CBS Sports’ Pete Prisco ranked Ingram as this offseason’s top free agent. Ingram would've landed a massive deal on the open market if Chargers let him walk. Woulda been nuts to let young pass rusher hit market — Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) February 28, 2017 \nIngram will have until July 15 to agree to a long-term deal with the Chargers. Otherwise, he’ll play under the tag, which is the equivalent of a one-year contract worth somewhere around $15 million. Even if they can’t work out a long-term deal, the Chargers ensured that their roster will boast a fierce pass rush next year in Ingram and Joey Bosa -- the reigning Defensive Rookie of the Year. \nIngram joins the Cardinals ’ Chandler Jones , the Panthers ’ Kawann Short , the Steelers ’ Le’Veon Bell, and the Giants ’ Jason Pierre-Paul in the group of players who were franchise tagged ahead of Wednesday’s deadline. They likely won’t be the last. At this point w/franchise tag deadline less than 48 hrs away, Cousins, Berry, Ingram, T. Johnson still are slam dunks barring new deals", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:53:04.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
