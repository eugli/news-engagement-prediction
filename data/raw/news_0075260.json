Tip is set for 2 p.m. on CBS. Check out this 247 preview to get you ready for the game. \nTwo storylines to monitor \n1. Big Game, But Not Too Big \nIn the Cats’ rematch with the Gators, control of the SEC regular season title at stake. So too is UK’s pride, to some extent, after Florida cruised to a 88-66 win in Gainesville earlier this month, that 22-point margin ranking as UF’s largest in the series. Both Kentucky, winners of its last five games, and Florida, winners of nine straight, have the chance to notch another credibility-building win for NCAA Tournament seeding purposes. Hype abounds, but John Calipari did his part to downplay the significance of Saturday’s matchup. \n“Now this game, we both have something to lose. They have something to lose too, now. They’ve played great. We'll see,” Calipari said. “I keep telling them, ‘There's going to be a time this season when you lose, your season ends. This ain't it. So just play.’ If you win, it's huge. It's big. If you don’t, you lose the game. Next game. Who we play next? If you win it's huge.” \n2. Rebounding \nOne reason – or perhaps the reason – the Gators outgunned UK in that first meeting was total domination on the glass. Florida won the rebounding battle 54-29, a whopping +25 advantage on the boards that allowed the Gators to outscore the Cats in second chance points 17-7. Calipari’s assessment: “Got to rebound the ball better.” Kentucky has done that in recent weeks, averaging a +10.6 rebounding margin in the five games since the debacle in Gainesville. Bam Adebayo has averaged 10.2 rebounds per game during that stretch and is coming off a career-high 15 boards against Missouri. \n“We all just gotta rebound and come up with boards,” Adebayo said. “They just got more 50-50 balls than us.” \nThe Gators secured nine team rebounds to just three by UK. Also of note: Florida will be missing big man John Egbunu , who pulled down seven rebounds and scored eight points in the first meeting. Egbunu is out for the season after injuring his knee vs. Auburn on Feb. 14. \nFour Florida players to watch \n1. KeVaugn Allen \nSophomore, Guard \n2016-17 Stats: 13.6 points, 2.6 rebounds \nBio Buzz: Allen is coming off a 26-point performance on in Florida’s 81-66 win over South Carolina, when he made 5 of 7 shot attempts to become the fifth SEC player in history to score 25 or more on sever or fewer shots. Against the Gamecocks, he converted 13 of 14 attempts at the free throw line and grabbed seven rebounds, both career highs. Since scoring 12 points in the Gators win over Kentucky, Allen (6-2, 183) has averaged 13.8 points per game while making 8 of 20 3-point attempts, right around his season average of .395 (58 of 147). \nGraduate, Guard \n2016-17 Stats: 12.7 points, 3.0 rebounds \nBio Buzz: Barry was held scoreless in nine minutes vs. South Carolina and scored seven points in the Gators’ 57-52 win at Mississippi State. Before that, however, Barry (6-6, 215) poured in a season-best 30 points in Florida’ 114-95 win over Auburn, then his sixth straight game in double figures. That includes his efficient appearance vs. Kentucky, when he dropped 14 points on 4-of-7 shooting in 18 minutes off the bench against the Cats. Renowned for his underhanded free throws, Barry has made 89.9 percent from the charity stripe this season, making 33 of his last 34 attempts. \n3. Devin Robinson \nJunior, Forward \n2016-17 Stats: 11.2 points, 5.8 rebounds \nBio Buzz: Since posting 16 points and nine rebounds against Kentucky on Feb. 4, Robinson has been up and down over the past five games. He scored 10 total points in wins over Georgia and Texas A&M before dropping 14 vs. Auburn. In the Gators’ close win against Mississippi State, Robinson (6-8, 200) finished scoreless on 0-of-6 shooting but grabbed 10 rebounds, four offensive. He turned in 14 points vs. the Gamecocks Tuesday, making 3 of 6 from 3-point range, where he’s shooting .384 (33 of 86) on the season. \nSenior, Guard \n2016-17 Stats: 9.7 points, 4.8 assists \nBio Buzz: The ninth meeting vs. Kentucky in Hill’s career was by far his best. The former McDonald’s All-American scored a career-high 21 points in 27 minutes against the Cats in Gainesville, making 8 of 16 shots to go with six assists and five rebounds. In the five games since then, Hill (6-1, 180) has averaged 9.0 points on 17-of-44 shooting (.386), but he did notch his second career double-double with 11 points and 12 assists in the win over Auburn. Hill is just the second player in Florida history to record more than 1,000 points and 500 assists in a career. \nSeven notes to keep in mind \n1. Kentucky leads the all-time series over Florida 99-38, including a 50-9 record in Lexington. John Calipari is 14-6 vs. the Gators in his career, while Mike White is 1-2 vs. UK. \n2. The Cats have not been swept in the regular season by an SEC opponent since Florida did so in 2014. Florida has swept the regular season series vs. UK four times total (1988, 2006, 2007). \n3. Kentucky is 47-21 against ranked opponents overall and 17-3 at home under Calipari. Two of those losses have come this season – vs. No. 11 UCLA on Dec. 4 and vs. No. 2 Kansas on Jan. 28. \n4. Malik Monk , who has reached double figures in all 28 games this season, is 10 points shy of becoming the second-highest scoring freshman under Calipari. Jamal Murray set the UK freshman scoring record last season with 720 points. \n5. Isaiah Briscoe has fouled out in back-to-back games, scoring nine points apiece vs. Georgia and Missouri. Prior to that, Briscoe had reached double figures in six of his last seven outings, the exception a 6-point performance on 3-of-10 shooting at Florida. Briscoe has 21 assists to 22 turnovers over the past six games. \n6. UK committed 17 turnovers vs. Missouri on Tuesday, tying its season high. Against Florida on Feb. 4, the Cats turned the ball over 14 times, leading to 17 points for the Gators. Florida outscored UK 18-8 in fast break points in the first meeting. \n7. Florida outscored UK 18-8 in fast break points in the first meeting. UK had just two fast break points vs. Missouri on Tuesday.
