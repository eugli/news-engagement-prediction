Scientology detractors) are responsible for Cruise’s flops. \nWATCH BELOW: Tom Cruise credits Scientology for his success \n“Scientologists believe that if he didn’t make [ Reacher ] a hit, it was because there were suppressive, evil people working against him, because he’s winning in life and clearing the planet,” she said to Maher. \nRemini’s A&E docuseries, Scientology and the Aftermath , featured interviews with former Scientology members who told their stories of alleged abuse, trauma and family destruction. For her part, Remini came clean about her past and told eyebrow-raising tales about the inner workings of the religion. \nIn dozens of monologues peppered with s- and f-bombs, Remini also admits she was a victim of the Scientology “brainwashing,” saying that she was raised into it and didn’t know any differently. To this day, she still has difficulty acclimatizing to life outside the church, and she even questions her own day-to-day thought processes. \nREAD MORE: Leah Remini reportedly suing Church of Scientology for $1.5M \nThe series, she claims, was her apology for promoting Scientology in the public sphere, and the exposure of the church isn’t meant to be malicious, but rather a wake-up call to those considering it or “trapped” in the religion. The allegations made by Remini and the guests on Aftermath are shocking, and if proven true in a court of law, we could be witnessing the final death throes of Scientology. \nYou can watch Remini and Maher’s discussion in the video at the top of this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:57:05.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
