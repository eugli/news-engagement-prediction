(AAP file) \nThe nation's capital has rewritten the record books this morning, producing a May-like morning in February. \nA strong front that crossed on the weekend carried a very cold airmass for this time of year over southeastern Australia. It even produced snow in the Victorian Alps. \nOvernight winds became light under clear skies, allowing the temperature to drop to a chilly 2.8 degrees. It is possible that a few people managed to spot a light frost on the ground in parts of the ACT. \nThe previous record was set in 1962 and again in 1985, with the mercury falling to 3.0 degrees. \nFrom tonight onward temperatures should be much warmer by day and by night, with minimum temperatures likely to stay near or above 10 degrees.
