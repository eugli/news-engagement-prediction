(Image source: Samsung Display Video) \nSamsung Galaxy S8 smartphone leaks continue as the launch date draws closer; the phone will be unveiled on March 29 in New York, according to reports. For now, Samsung has only confirmed the Galaxy S8 is not going to be launched at the Mobile World Congress (MWC 2017) in Barcelona, unlike the earlier Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. After the Samsung Galaxy S8+ logo was unveiled by tipster Evan Blass, he has also confirmed the Galaxy S8 is coming in two versions. \nEvan Blass put out a new tweet confirming the display sizes for the upcoming Galaxy S8 smartphone. According to his tweet, the Galaxy S8 base variant will start at 5.8-inches, while the bigger variant called the Galaxy S8+ will sport a 6.2-inch display. Both will have SAMOLED display, which is not surprising given Samsung is the biggest manufacturer for AMOLED displays, and has been using these in its flagship smartphones for sometime. \nAnother leak from Weibo shows the front of the Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone with no home button, something which has been confirmed already. In January, Samsung had put out promotional videos for its Display Division, and in the end the video showed a smartphone with thin bezels on the top and bottom and no home button on the front. \nThis was taken to be the first look for the Galaxy S8, and we’ll have to wait and if see the new phones look anything like the image revealed in the video. Leaks of Samsung Galaxy S8 panels have also indicated there will no home button. Samsung is also expected to put in place a dedicated button on the side for its new upcoming voice-assistant, which is code-named ‘Bixby’. \nWatch all our videos from Express Technology \nIf you go by Blass’ tweet, Samsung Galaxy S8 will be a pretty big smartphone. Basically, Samsung is pushing the base size to a 5.8-inch variant, which means users who were hoping for a more manageable size like a 5.1-inch phone as with the S7, can forget about it. The Galaxy S8 is also expected to sport a near bezel-less display, and the dual edge style we saw on the Galaxy S7 edge. \nCheck out Evan Blass’ tweet below I’ve been seeing this misreported quite a bit, so, just to clarify: \nGS8 – 5.8″ QHD", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:02:30.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
