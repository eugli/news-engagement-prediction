In a press junker, Bearchell was asked about her thoughts on being “larger” than other Miss Universe candidates.

Why are we bringing down this woman who just gave one of the best performances ever displayed on one of the biggest, most celebrated stages in the world? Further, what message does this send our young women?” she said.

Despite your creativity and genius ideas, we will only talk about your waistline? Even though you may be the first woman to forge a path in your field, we will only compare your body to our expectations of beauty? It’s time to change this conversation,” Bearchell added. \nAnother Miss Universe candidate, Violina Ancheva of Bulgaria, also made the news after giving her Sherri Hill gown to a Filipina teenager who could not afford a prom dress.
