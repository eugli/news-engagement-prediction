Although it's been months since Trump needed to rally in the traditional sense (he won the election in November, was confirmed by the Electoral College in December and was sworn in last month), the first few weeks of his presidency have not gone smoothly and The Washington Post described the rally as an attempt at a sort of reset for the administration.

He was dressed casually, with his top shirt buttons undone and no tie, and hit on points that energize his base—like immigration reform (he said his administration will release a new immigration order soon) and bringing jobs back to the United States. He also took the opportunity to reiterate his criticisms of the mainstream media, which he's called the \"enemy of the American People.\" He tweeted about the media on Friday and again a few hours before his rally. The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes , @NBCNews , @ABC , @CBS , @CNN ) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 Don't believe the main stream (fake news) media.The White House is running VERY WELL. I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2017 \"I want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news,\" Trump said to the crowd at the rally. \"The dishonest media, which has published one false story after another with no sources, even though they pretend they have them–they make them up in many cases. They just don't want to report the truth.\" He then promised to not let the media \"get away with\" reporting lies, at which time, CNN reports, the members of the press in attendance stood and booed. \"When the media lies to people, I will never, ever, let them get away with it. I will do whatever I can that they don't get away with it,\" he said. \"They have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda.\" Follow Marie Claire on F acebook for the latest celeb news, beauty tips, fascinating reads, livestream video, and more.
