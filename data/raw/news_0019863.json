(Ricardo Ramirez Buxeda / Orlando Sentinel) Staff Report \nThe speed and skill of Oviedo’s girls soccer team was at full throttle during Friday’s Class 5A state semifinal, and it was simply too much for Lithia Newsome to handle, even on its own field. \nOviedo blanked the Wolves 3-0, and left their hosts feeling a tremendous respect for the Lions who are now in position to defend their state title and win a fourth FHSAA crown in seven years. \nThe Lions will play Boca Raton (25-0-0) on Friday at 4 p.m. at Spec Martin Stadium in DeLand. \n“(Oviedo) had so much speed all over the field,” Newsome coach Kelly Townsend said. “We did eveything we possible could, but we didn’t come up with answers.” \nOviedo, 21-0-1 and ranked No. 1 in the state and No. 3 in the country by Maxpreps.com made a statement in the third minute when Erin Mikalsen sent a perfect throw into the box and Madi Allen chipped a pinpoint header into the net’s left side. \nThree minutes later, the Lions Kaitlyn Zipay rifled a shot from 20 yards cleanly into the back of the net. \nJust like that, Oviedo was up 2-0 against Newsome (20-1-3) who appeared a little shellshocked. \n“When you can score two goals within the first seven minutes in a game like this you gain a huge advantage,” Oviedo coach Scott Waisanen said. “It’s tough for teams to come back from something like that.” \nNewsome (ranked No. 4 in the state and No. 11 nationally) had a couple of decent shots midway through the first half, but really never threatened most of the night. \nIn the game’s 33rd minute, the Lions pretty much sealed the Wolves’ fate when Allen popped another perfect header over Newsome’s leaping keeper. \n“It’s never easy winning these games because there are a lot of great teams (in Class 5A),” Waisanen said. “Our girls get nervous but I do think having the (deep playoff experience) helps a lot. We know what to expect.” \nBy Scott Purks \nMontverde girls win \nMontverde struck like lightning, and goalkeeper Julia Curatolo withstood Jacksonville Bolles’ offense Friday as the Eagles defeated the two-time defending 2A state champions 2-1. \nMontverde (25-2) advances to a state semifinal to play West Palm Beach Oxbridge , a 1-0 overtime winner vs. Tampa Academy of the Holy Names (19-2-2), at 4 p.m. on Wednesday at Spec Martin Stadium in DeLand. \nMontverde, playing its initial season in an FHSAA district, made the state final in its first chance. \nThe Eagles broke the scoreless tie with 15:01 left in the half. Montverde’s Maria Contreras found Shayla Smart open on a long run, and Smart’s shot from 15 yards beat Bolles keeper Clair Cywes low left. Cywes made three saves. \n“They were man-marking me, and I got a perfect ball,” Smart said. “It was tough going against their defense. They were playing down our throats, playing really well on the outside and mids.” \nNine minutes later, Montverde keeper Julia Curatolo kept it 1-0 by saving a penalty kick against Avery Patterson. Patterson kicked just right of center and low, but Curatolo dove to save the kick. Aristodemo said that Curatolo saved two penalty kicks in the shootout in the regional final against Bishop Moore. \n“Since it’s in-game, you’re always nervous, because you could save it, but they can still come and shoot it,” Curatolo said. “I just wanted to stay calm and collected.” \nMontverde increased the lead to 2-0 with 37:14 left in the second half. Katie Beck headed in a corner kick into the center of the goal for the Eagles. \n“Coach told me nobody’s pressuring in the box, so I had to go for it,” Beck said. “We were trying to turn them around, keep them on their heels and push forward.” \nBolles broke the shutout when USF signee Leah Ferlin headed a corner kick off the left post, then Vanderbilt signee Leila Azari kicked in the rebound with 21:08 left. \nBy Lynn Ramsey \nSeminole falls 4-3 \nAs his players quietly packed up their belongings on the visitors side of Lakewood Ranch’s stadium on Friday, Brian Emrick made sure he made contact with each and every one. \nThe Seminole's boys soccer coach offered up either a hug, a kind word, or a pat on the back. \nSometimes, he offered up all three. \nIn the wake of the Seminoles’ 4-3 loss to host Lakewood Ranch (19-2-1) in a Class 5A state semifinal, Emrick may not have been pleased with the result. But he could find no fault in the effort of his players, who pushed the Mustangs, ranked 10th in the nation by MaxPreps, to the limit despite trailing by two goals on three different occasions during the second half. \nSeminole finished 24-3-3. \n“Our goal was just to make it to the regional playoffs,” Emrick said. “We had a lot of juniors and they did a lot of growing up during the season.” \nLess than a minute after Ranch took a 2-0 lead on a goal from Ricky Yanez with 28 minutes to play, Seminole scored its first goal courtesy of defenseman John Matos. And after a sliding, Connor Bezet knocked in a cross from Sam Stapleton-Jones giving Ranch a 3-1 lead with 22 to play. Nicholas Brahmbhatt’s goal off a corner two minutes later again brought the Seminoles to within one. \nThe Mustangs appeared to salt the game away when Pablo Vargas returned from a yellow card and scored with less than four minutes remaining. But Seminole answered yet again when Jordan Katz netted a penalty kick with a little more than two minutes to play. \nScoreless for the game’s first 37 minutes, Lakewood Ranch and Seminole teamed for six goals over the game’s final 28. \n“That’s just two teams that didn’t want to lose,” Emrick said. “We had to press forward, and when we did, we’re taking a couple of chances in the back and they capitalized on some opportunities. They’ve got a couple of really talented forwards who move off the ball well. They finished some opportunities. In the first half, they were missing the frame, and the second half, they put them in the back of the net.” \n“Our guys never quit. That’s a very good team over there,” Emrick said. “It’s real tough when in a final four game you have to travel instead being at a neutral site. But that’s the way it is.” \nBy John Lembo \nSandcrabs rally to win \nNoah Collins scored both goals for Daytona Beach Seabreeze (22-1-2) as the Sandcrabs rallied to defeating defending state champ Ponte Vedra 2-1. \nThe Sandcrabs will play Merritt Island on Saturday, Feb. 17, at 10 a.m. in DeLand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:12:25.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
