And more than 780 waited more than 12 hours. Both figures are record highs since the introduction in 2004 of a target that 95% of patients must be seen and either admitted or discharged in under four hours. \nThe leaked document from NHS Improvement suggests that out of 1.4m visits in January, only 82% were dealt with within the four-hour target.\nOverwhelmed hospitals sent A&E patients away 89 times in five weeks Read more \nThe NHS Providers chief executive, Chris Hopson, said: “These figures have not been verified and should therefore be treated with caution, but they are in line with the feedback we have been getting from trusts.\n“NHS staff have responded magnificently to increased winter pressures, but the situation has become unsustainable. The rise in long trolley waits is particularly worrying, as there is clear evidence they can lead to worse outcomes for patients.”\nHospitals have not hit the target nationally since the summer of 2015.\nA Department of Health spokesman said the January data was yet to be verified and that official figures, due out on Thursday morning, only covered December.\nHe said: “We do not recognise these figures – it is irresponsible to publish unverified data and does a disservice to all NHS staff working tirelessly to provide care around the clock.\n“Despite the pressures of winter, the vast majority of patients are seen and treated quickly and hospitals have detailed plans in place to manage busy periods – supported by an extra £400m of funding.” \nDr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association council, said delays in A&E were a symptom of a bigger crisis in social care, which the government was failing to grasp.\n“When social care isn’t available, patients experience delays in moving from hospital to appropriate ongoing care settings – preventing patients being admitted at the front end in A&E,” he said.\n“The prime minister cannot continue to bury her head in the sand as care continues to worsen.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:43:07.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
