Supreme Court has already repealed the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act-2004 passed by the Punjab Vidhan Sabha and now the matter was pending with the apex court for implementation,” said Mr. Khattar. \nHe said that though the SYL issue was sub-judice, Haryana should get its due share of water. “I'm hopeful that the State would get its rightful share,” he said. \n“I urge to the people and other political parties not to take law in their own hands. Even though this issue is related to Punjab government yet I believe that peace would prevail in the State,” he said, adding the law and order situation in Haryana would be maintained. \nINLD leader Abhay Chautala has announced that party worker would march towards Punjab after gathering in Ambala's grain market - to dig SYL canal in an attempt to get its share of water. \nBarricades erected \nIn the wake of INLD's proposed march security arrangements have been beefed by both Haryana and Punjab police at the border villages of the two States in a bid to keep law and order situation under check. Barricades have been erected at Shambhu barrier on NH1 on Punjab and Haryana border and to prevent individuals from assembling in the area, section 144 has been implemented. \nWhile Punjab has deployed 10 companies of paramilitary forces and around 5,000 policemen in villages adjoining Haryana border. Haryana on other hand has deployed five companies of paramilitary forces, besides heavy deployment of police. \nEven the Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Centre to maintain surveillance in view of the proposed march by INLD workers. \nPunjab and Haryana are set for a face-off on the issue of sharing water from the SYL canal after political parties from both the States have taken a stiff stance on water sharing. \nWhile Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal has been reiterating that Punjab does not have extra water to spare for any other State and not a single drop can be allowed to flow through SYL, the Punjab Congress president Capt. Amarinder Singh had demanded preventive arrest of INLD leader Abhay Chautala and alleged that it was evident that the Haryana government was not serious about nipping the situation that could arise out the proposed march. \nPTI adds:The Haryana Congress on Wednesday hit out at the INLD, accusing it of doing politics over the water-sharing issue. \nSpeaking to scribes here, State Congress chief Ashok Tanwar dubbed the INLD’s announcement as “a political stunt” and said the party had earlier failed to support various accords which were in Haryana’s favour. \nFight for survival \n“What INLD is doing is just a political stunt. The party is on its last legs and fighting for its survival. Now, suddenly it has dawned upon them that they have to safeguard Haryana’s interests on water issue,” said Mr. Tanwar. “INLD opposed Rajiv-Longowal and other accords which were in Haryana’s favour. Everyone knows that the Chautalas and the ruling Badal family in Punjab share close family ties. Both the Akalis and the INLD have been shadow-boxing on the water issue to fool the people,” he said. \nThe State Congress chief alleged the INLD of using the SYL issue “like a political football for its vested interests”. \n“In Haryana, everyone knows they are playing second fiddle to the BJP and now no one is going to believe in the stunts they are trying to indulge in,” Mr Tanwar said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:19:24.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
