Heavy rain gave way to thunder and lightning near the end of the second quarter, with officials ordering players off the ground for their safety. An early halftime was called with three-and-a-half minutes left on the clock and the Demons up 1.4 (10) to 1.0 (6). Lightning forces players off 1:05 \nThe lightning soon dissipated and the teams played out the time remaining from the second quarter before switching ends for the third stanza. Had the game been abandoned, it would have been deemed a draw under AFL rules because play was stopped before halftime. \nThe Lions seemed to benefit from the break, with Sabrina Frederick-Traub snapping a brilliant goal in traffic to put the Lions ahead. With heavy rain starting to fall after just five minutes of play, it was little surprise the game was a scrapfest. \nThe Demons had a blustery wind in their favour in the first quarter but failed to convert their opportunities. \nBrisbane soon took control of the game, holding the Demons goalless during the second half and booting two fourth-quarter majors to seal the win.

They’re a really spirited group and they don’t mind an obstacle or two.” \nMelbourne coach Mick Stinear said his side struggled to adapt to the conditions and didn’t make the best of their early momentum. \n“We probably took a little too long to adjust,” he said. \n“There were opportunities to get forward and put the other team under pressure and we kept looking for that extra handball.” \nLions onballer Emily Bates (11 disposals, eight tackles) stood out at the stoppages, Samantha Virgo marshalled the play from the backline and Frederick- Traub was a constant threat. \nDemons captain Daisy Pearce (19 touches, nine tackles) relished the wet conditions, with Karen Paxman also impressive. \nDemons forward Richelle Cranston is likely to face scrutiny for a high bump after barrelling into Lions midfielder Jamie Stanton during the first term. Stanton left the field with a shoulder injury but returned to play out the game. View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
