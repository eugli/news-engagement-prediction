The name she has had her entire life but could not write because she never went to school. At 90, she's relieved she has managed it. \n\"All my life I have been illiterate. It's like being only half human. But what could I do? My parents were too poor to send me to school. Now I can die knowing I can write my name,' she said. \nDeshmukh, a widow, has lived in Phangane, a village in India's Maharashtra state, ever since she was married. Allison Joyce/Newslions \nThe School For Grannies aims to empower elderly women and break taboos around widowhood. \nHer two sons, daughters-in-law and grandchildren live with her. It's her youngest granddaughter who escorts her to school every morning. READ MORE: \nYes, school. Allison Joyce/Newslions \nOlder women who were deprived of a formal education as children attend school in Phangane, India. \nDeshmukh attends a School for Grannies (Aajibaichi Shala), probably the only one of its kind in India. \nGrannies aged above 60 who have never been to school have been learning to read, write and do basic arithmetic over the past 11 months. \nDeshmukh is the eldest in the class of 28 nanas. Though she is hard of hearing, she has managed to learn the alphabet (in the local language, Marathi). Allison Joyce/Newslions \n80-year-old Ramabai Ganpat Khandakle is one of 30 elderly women attending school for the first time in their lives. \nThe School for Grannies was started by Yogendra Bangar, 40, a teacher in the village primary school. Ad Feedback \nThe idea occurred to him when, during a religious celebration at which officials were reading from the scriptures, an elderly woman said: \"If we knew how to read, we could read the holy books ourselves at home instead of others doing it for us\". \nBangar says he realised that no one had ever before thought of doitng anything for the old women in the village. Allison Joyce/Newslions \nSeven-year-old Sujal, right, helps his grandmother, Kanta More, 65, with her schoolwork. \n\"They had been wives and mothers and home makers and looked after everyone but no one gave any thought to their desires,\" he says. \nHis other reason for opening the school – basically a new classroom built as an extension of the existing primary school – was to teach the young to respect the elderly. \n\"A grandmother is a diamond. Value her, is our message,\" he says. Supplied \nYogendra Bangar founded the School for Grannies in India. \nEvery weekday, between two and four pm, the grannies turn up for classes, all wearing their uniform of a bright pink sari and a satchel containing their slate, chalk, and textbook. \nWhy a uniform? \n\"Well, all schools have uniforms so why should they be any different?\" answers Bangar. \nWhy bright pink? \n\"Widows in India are forbidden to wear bright colours. They are meant to wear only white to show they are still grieving for their husband and cannot enjoy life. That's why I deliberately chose pink, to break those old taboos,\" he says. \nThe entire village backs his project. \nOn the first day of school, he said the entire village turned up to celebrate the grannies' arrival and there were garlands and a brass band. \nDilip Dalal, founder of the Motiram Dalal Charitable Trust which has helped co-found the school, says it has been a success. \n\"The grannies are so eager to learn, such good students, that it's a pleasure to see them make progress,\" he said. \nHe also believes it sends out an important message to children who are not keen on studying. \n\"They need to realise that if they don't study now, it might be a whole lifetime before they get a chance again,\" says Dalal. \nSita, 62, who goes by only one name, said she had always looked at her children's school textbooks when they were young and had longed to learn to read. \nLater in life, she used to look at her grandchildren's textbooks and feel the same yearning. \n\"No one except another uneducated person knows the embarrassment of being illiterate. Now I can hold my head up high in front of other people,\" says Sita. \nLike the others, Sita gets homework. If she gets stuck, her grandchildren help her out. \nHer proudest moment a few months ago was when she visited the bank for some work. Earlier, she had always given a thumbprint on documents as she couldn't sign. This time, she signed her name. \n\"I felt very proud because signing is more dignified than giving your thumb impression,' she says. \nBangar is hoping that some grannies in neighbouring villages will also start attending. \nOn International Woman's Day, March 8, the school will celebrate its first anniversary. Bangar has plans for a Sports Day. \n\"Don't worry,\" he laughs. \"We're not planning any strenuous races. Just some music and dancing.\" - Sydney Morning Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:19:27.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
