'Are you serious? To be honest, no, it's not anything I'm interested in,' Nicole told her partner then added, 'Am I not good enough for you, is that what it is?' Three's a crowd: As part of the gag, a caller named Marl called her wife Nicole and told her that she missed men and wanted the pair to have a threesome She then became angry and told her wife, 'If it's something you want to do then maybe you should just go and do it.' Marl pushed her wife, who has never had a relationship with a man, to the bring when she said she 'misses penis'. Nicole broke down crying, 'Why the f**k would you marry me? I don't think I can be there when you get home.' Kyle and Jackie realised the prank had gone way too far and stepped in to save the pair from splitting up on live radio. Oh no: Marl's wife Nicole broke down crying, 'Why the f**k would you marry me? I don't think I can be there when you get home' However all was not entirely well as Marl admitted at the end of the joke that she did in fact miss men 'a little'. Meanwhile, Kyle's own relationship with 26-year-old girlfriend Imogen Anthony is going from strength-to-strength. The 45 year-old radio jock was treated to a Valentine's Day Tribute from his girlfriend who posted a picture of the pair to Instagram and called him her 'John Wayne'.
