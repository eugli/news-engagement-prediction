He has not played for the club since Dec 27, although Stoke are paying a large portion of his £120,000 a week wages.\nIbrahim Afellay, Stephen Ireland and Shay Given are out of contract this summer while Philipp Wollscheid, Marc Muniesa and Joselu will also be sold if the club receive acceptable offers.\nPremier League and EFL Cup final team of the week S toke expect to trigger an option to extend former England international Glen Johnson’s deal by a further year but major changes are still expected over the summer.\nHughes has the support of the Stoke hierarchy and remains on course for a top-10 finish but there is a realisation at board level that the squad needs younger, more dynamic players.\nSaido Berahino was signed from West Bromwich Albion for £12m in January and fulfils the criteria of future Hughes signings.\nStoke are seeking a response this weekend at home to Middlesbrough after the 4-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday .\nEver presents H ughes read the riot act to his players at half-time, after a hat-trick from Harry Kane and a goal from Dele Alli put Spurs in total control, and Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross admitted the rant was deserved.\n“When you put in a performance like that it's not good enough and you've got no reply. He was very angry,” he said.\n\"There were a lot of harsh words from the manager at half-time and they were fully deserved.\n“We keep wanting to push forward but it's not happening at the moment. It's something I'm not pleased about as a defender and neither is the manager. It's something we're all disappointed about. I probably think it's our attitude.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:07:33.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
