Day two of the International Defence Conference (IDEX) and Naval Defence Exhibition and Conference (NAVDEX) 2017 saw a whopping Dh6.9billion worth military procurement deals between the UAE and other international entities. It included a contract between the UAE and Russia for anti-armor missiles, which amounted to over Dh2.6 billion. The contract includes 5,000 anti-armor missiles, as well as training and support with Rosoboronexport, said Brigadier General Rashid Mohammed Al Shamsi, official spokesperson for the 13 th edition of Idex during a press hearing on Monday. Rosoboronexport, which produces firearms, tanks, ammunition, as well as attack helicopters, is the sole state intermediary agency for all defence related import and export between Russia and foreign countries, and is ranked among the top in the defence market. Currently, India is Rosoboronexport's top client, with China as second.

He noted that in total, 10 transactions were concluded on Monday, adding that the deals for weapons are not solely related to fighting terrorists. \"The contracts today are related to armed forces, not necessarily to combating terrorism.\" \"When contracts are signed for weapons, we think of the best supplier,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:24:54.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
