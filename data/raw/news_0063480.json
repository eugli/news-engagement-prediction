Just when we thought we finally cleared the song out of our heads, the cosmetic behemoth surprised us with the release of the Tarte Maneater Liquid Eyeliner, which launched today. Now, you can create a complete sultry eye makeup look with the full Maneater line. The Maneater Eyeshadow Palette includes some of our favorite warm shades, including Hypnotic (metallic burgundy ) and Lace (champagne)—the latter can even double as a highlighter . After you've coated your lids with the eyeshadow, you can draw on sharp AF winged liner with the new Maneater Liquid Eyeliner. To up the smoke factor, we suggest applying the Maneater Self-Sharpening Eyeliner on your lower lash lines. Last but not least, finish off the look with a couple coats of the Maneater Voluptuous Mascara—we guarantee that you'll have the lushest lashes in the room no matter where you're headed. (If it happen to be on a date, opt for one of these lipsticks , too).
