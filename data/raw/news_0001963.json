She will have follow-up immunotherapy and the total cost of her treatment will amount to $1,200,000. Kelly has endured nine rounds of chemotherapy and because she has a tumour close to her liver doctors in the UK are unwilling to carry out surgery The teen in hospital being visited by the Kaiser Chiefs' Ricky Wilson Kelly visiting the Rovers Return, where she met actor Simon Gregson (left) Kelly was given just two years to live when she was diagnosed in October 2015. After nine rounds of chemo the NHS refused to carry out surgery or to fund it abroad abroad, forcing Kelly, her mum Linda and dad Martin, to fundraise on JustGiving for her treatment. 'She's been well cared for by The Royal Marsden, Sutton UK with nine rounds of chemotherapy which has responded well, Martin said. Bubbly teenager Kelly, pictured before she underwent nine rounds of chemo Family friend John Ashman pictured with Kelly during a sponsored sleep out which raised £10,000 for her treatment Kelly celebrating her 16th birthday: She's been given a lifeline by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York where medics have agreed to carry out surgery, radiotherapy and immunotherapy 'But because there are tumours close to her liver they're not prepared to carry out any surgery. DESMOPLASTIC SMALL ROUND CELL TUMOUR This rare cancer is an aggressive tumour that typically begins in the abdomen or pelvis. This rare type of soft tissue sarcoma generally affects teenagers and young adults, primarily boys In young women, it's sometimes mistaken for ovarian cancer. The prognosis is poor, but patients with inoperable tumours can benefit from low doses of chemo, turning the disease into a chronic illness. 'We have sought a fifth opinion from Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York and they have agreed to do the surgery, immunotherapy and radiotherapy. Thanks to the actor's donation, the family have now raised more £450,000. Kelly's dad said he was impressed with the Hollywood actor's kind approach when he visited his daughter. He said: 'He decided to come and visit everyone and spent a lot of time talking to Kelly and the others. 'She managed to grab a selfie with him, so that's another celebrity she's met.' The teenager has also met the Kaiser Chief's Ricky Wilson who posed for a snap with Kelly at her bedside. She's also been to visit the set of Coronation Street where she met Simon Gregson who plays Steve McDonald. A family friend spent seven nights sleeping out in freezing temperatures to raise money for Kelly's treatment Kelly funding has been given a further boost by family friend and father-of-four John Ashman, 50, who endured freezing temperatures while sleeping rough on the streets to raise money. He managed to raise £10,000 - doubling his target of £5,000 Martin said: 'John doesn't take to compliments well, but as far as we're concerned he's a hero.'
