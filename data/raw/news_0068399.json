The Green Bay Packers signed the Saline native in late January to a three-year “futures” contract that begins March 9. \n“I’m ready to take that challenge,” Pepper said after the Free Press Dream Team football banquet in Dearborn last week. “This is the cream of the crop I’m going to be with right now.” \nBrett Goode, the Packers’ 32-year-old veteran long-snapper, is a free agent. That could open a chance for the 22-year-old Pepper to step in and immediately snap for field goals, extra-point attempts and punts. \nThe 6-foot-4, 245-pound Pepper seized MSU’s starting snapping job as a true freshman in 2012 and was part of the Spartans’ victories in the Rose Bowl and Cotton Bowl, two Big Ten championships and the College Football Playoff. MSU long snapper’s dad has curious connection to TV’s ‘Modern Family’ \n“Whenever I came to State, originally it was going to be me and Steve Moore competing for the spot. Two weeks before camp, he broke his neck, so I kind of had the position thrust upon me,” Pepper said. “I was ready to compete for it and I wanted to win the position. I kind of feel like it might be the same type of thing (in Green Bay) where it might be thrust upon me. ” \nAfter graduating from MSU following the 2015 CFP appearance, Pepper spent two minicamps with the Baltimore Ravens last summer. There, he worked with Jerry Rosburg, Tom Izzo’s former roommate at Northern Michigan whose son Jarad plays hockey at MSU. Pepper also had a tryout with the Seattle Seahawks. \nPepper has been working out at the Saline High weight room, helping with his alma mater’s special teams and maintaining a day job while preparing for the NFL. His special teams coach with the Packers will be former Florida and Illinois coach Ron Zook, who recruited him while with the Illini. \n“At this level, that won’t help very much,” Pepper said with a chuckle. “Ever since I got an inkling that Green Bay might be interested in me and I got signed, it’s given me something to shoot for and it’s made training so much easier. Going into the unknown everyday was the worst part. \n“Having something to shoot for, you’re able to put yourself in a better mental state and push your workouts even farther than normal.” \nContact Chris Solari: .
