YouTube Paul Joseph Watson made an offer to pay journalists to experience the ‚Äòcrime ridden‚Äô reality of life in Sweden \nBut in defiance of the facts, Watson wrote on Monday: ‚ÄúAny journalist claiming Sweden is safe; I will pay for travel costs & acommodation for you to stay in crime ridden migrant suburbs of Malmo‚Äù. Any journalist claiming Sweden is safe; I will pay for travel costs & accommodation for you to stay in crime ridden migrant suburbs of Malmo ‚Äî Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) February 20, 2017 \nWatson, whose videos include ‚ÄúDear Virtue Signalling Celebrities: it‚Äôs time to put up or shut the f*ck up‚Äù, appeared to attempt to silence those claiming Sweden is safe. \nYet since offering the expenses-paid trip to journalists, Watson has been remarkably quiet and has yet to respond publicly to the many dozens of replies accepting his offer. @PrisonPlanet I accept. I will send you my bank info and send you selfies from Malmo. If you do not pay, you will be ridiculed. ‚Äî Joey Ayoub (@joeyayoub) February 20, 2017 I am still waiting for my money @PrisonPlanet .

How long can I stay? Fortnight? ‚Äî Chris Hemmings (@Hemmch) February 20, 2017 \nHowever, Watson did respond more generally, writing: ‚ÄúAll you lefty idiots accepting a ‚Äòtrip to Sweden‚Äô. Can you read? I said you‚Äôd be staying here. Good luck. üòÜ‚Äù. All you lefty idiots accepting a \"trip to Sweden\". Can you read? I said you'd be staying here.
