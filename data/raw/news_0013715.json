Homebuyers will cross a \"break even\" point where the amount of equity they have in a home outweighs the steep down payment initially put down. In Dallas-Fort Worth, that amount of time is just 1.5 years, according to Zillow. 13 photos Dallas-Fort Worth Breakeven horizon 2016 Q4: 1 year, 6 months Breakeven horizon 2015 Q4:… more DFW is a bit of a unique case. Usually, when home prices increase at the crazy rate North Texas has seen — 43.3 percent increase in five years , according to Case-Shiller and 11.6 percent in just the last year, according to Zillow — that lowers the break even point because homebuyers are gaining extra equity just because their home value is rising. But DFW's break even point increased compared to last year when it was just 1.25 years (a three-month increase). That's caused by two things, said Skylar Olsen, chief economist for Zillow. Rent in DFW increased almost 4 percent last year, Olsen said. While 4 percent is well above several U.S. markets, it pales in comparison to the 11.6-percent increase home prices saw. \"Housing prices increased so much faster that your price-to-rent ratio increased, which lengthened your break even,\" Olsen said. In other words, it got more expensive to rent, but it got much more expensive to buy a home. Another reason is home prices are still expected to go up this year, but only at a 5-percent clip. Buying now won't give you the sort of equity that buying last year would have, according to the projections. While the break-even point increased this year, it's still nothing like some of the markets on the West Coast where it'll take more than 4 years in some markets to break even on a house. To see what the break even points are for other U.S. markets, see the attached slideshow. Evan Hoopfer is the Dallas Business Journal's digital reporter.
