I would never sell him or anyone out for a financial gain. \n“But like any loving doting partner I will protect my love till the end. Because isn’t that love? Protect, love and secure each other. We have our disagreements. Never about anything other then trying to persist in a relationship were so madly in love with but find it hard. They dated last year (Photo: FameFlynet) Jamie also shared this Snapchat (Photo: Snapchat) \n\"I’m so glad we get to spend some time together other then juggling everything we deal with like normal day to day people plus a little bit more drama, nice I get to remember why we keep fighting. \n“The love will always always remain weather we last a life time a long time or a little time. And that is the beauty of what no one or anything can take away!” \nJamie split from Elizabeth-Jayne eight months ago, with the model telling The Sun in January: “Me and Jamie have not been together for eight or nine months. He is there [CBB] for nothing to do with me and not my problem.” Jamie and Bianca in the CBB house (Photo: Supplied by WENN) Jamie and Bianca were very close Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T11:18:52.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
