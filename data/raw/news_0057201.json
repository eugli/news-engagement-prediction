Maybe their fur isn’t the right colour or their tail’s too stumpy. \nWhatever the ridiculous reason, more often than not people are missing out on homing a great cat. \nOne guy who realises this is Jeff Wysaski, AKA Obvious Plant, an animal-loving comedian who has created description tags for the cats in his local animal shelter in order to help re-home them. \nImagining a personality for each cat, Jeff listed their likes and dislikes, and left the listings outside the entrance to Sante D’Or Animal Rescue in Los Angeles. \nPosting his work to his Facebook page , Jeff wrote: ‘I gave these adoptable cats some interesting likes and dislikes. \n‘All these cats are real and need a home!’ \nCheck out Jeff’s work below.
