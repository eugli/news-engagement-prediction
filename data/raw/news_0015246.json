She plays the role of an undercover agent.\nThe movie is India's first spin-off based on Taapsee's character in Neeraj Pandey's film 'Baby,' a film revolving around a group of undercover agents who prevent terrorist attacks in India.\nThe producer of the film, Shital Bhatia said, \"It's really exciting that the trailer of 'Naam Shabana' is coming out with 'Jolly LLB 2', as Akshay Kumar was in 'Baby' and 'Naam Shabana' is Baby's spin off.\"\nIt is also interesting to note that Akshay Kumar is the common factor in both movies. It will be a treat for the audience to get a double dose of the actor in the theatres as well as watching the 29-year-old actress in a totally different avatar from her previous widely appreciated film 'Pink.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:14:54.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
