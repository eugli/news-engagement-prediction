And yep, you guessed again, it was by user @Owen755 who claimed responsibility for the hack with a “That was fun” tweet. (The account has since been suspended.)\nJohn then took to Twitter to apologize for the hacking, and clear things up with his fans.\nI'm back. My hacker was vulgar and kinda hilarious. I'll try to be funnier from now on so he won't feel the need to ghost write for me.\n— John Legend (@johnlegend) February 25, 2017 I would never threaten violence to the President.

Big in the tweet about Hillary. Small in the bio. Make up your mind, hacker.\n— John Legend (@johnlegend) February 25, 2017 And you know John's wife Chrissy had to get in on the action; the model tweeted out a screenshot of a DM she received while the hacker was in John's account.\nBest dm of my life @yashar pic.twitter.com/Kqn21nEXfX\n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 25, 2017 How are these two still the perfect couple in the face of a hacking? I would hate them if I didn't love them so damn much. (If they ever break up, I will burn the internet to the ground. That is both a warning and a promise.)\nFollow Laura on Twitter .\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/mrpenguino", "https://twitter.com/johnlegend/status/835349259826294784", "https://twitter.com/johnlegend/status/835348908108726274", "https://twitter.com/yashar", "https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/835337851789139969", "https://twitter.com/johnlegend/status/835351222789890048", "https://twitter.com/johnlegend/status/835348422869688320", "https://t.co/Kqn21nEXfX", "https://twitter.com/johnlegend/status/835348759269670913"], "published": "2017-02-25T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:41:27.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
