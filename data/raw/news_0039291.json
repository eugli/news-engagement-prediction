'With Donald Trump, everything he does, it can be turned into speculation, and that can be turned into gambling.'\nGamblers can place wagers on what year they believe Trump will get the boot, with bigger payouts assigned for later in his first term, indicating that oddsmakers believe the Republican will get impeached or resign sooner rather than later.\nWhile a 2017 bet on the Paddy Power website has the odds of 4-to-1, a 2020 wager currently stands at 20-to-1.\nOver at Ladbrokes, the British oddsmaker rates Trump's chances of resigning or being impeached in his first term at 11-to-10 – in short, it's so probable that gamblers would barely win any money.\nThe sites are allowing users to bet on other aspects of the presidency too.\nAt Paddy Power, there's betting going on currently about what foreign country Trump will visit as president first.\nWith the highest probability comes Trump's wife's homeland of Slovenia, with the odds set at 15-to-8.\nFollowing that comes Canada, England, Mexico, Iceland and Russia – countries that are neighbors\nLarger payouts would go to betters if Trump makes a more unconventional choice.\nIf Trump were to choose to visit Israel first the odds stand at 14-to-1. If he goes to Cuba first, bets are set at 80-to-1. And if he heads to North Korea first – which is extremely unlikely – the odds stand at 200-to-1.\nPaddy Power is also allowing gamblers to choose which administration official gets the ax first.\nCurrently, the most probably looks to be White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, at 4-to-1 odds, or a 20 percent chance of happening.\nAfter Spicer, oddmakers suggest that National Security Advisor Michael Flynn may want to watch out, followed by White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway, who received a 'counseling' after promoting Ivanka Trump's products on cable news last week.\nFlynn is in hot water over whether he talked about sanctions with Russian officials before Trump was sworn in.\nOddmakers also assigned a 10-to-1 to Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court pick, that the president would revoke offering the judge a job.\nOver at the betting site Bovada, users can place bets on which Supreme Court Justice will leave the bench next.\nOn a $100 bet, gamblers can win $150 for choosing 80-year-old Justice Anthony Kennedy or 83-year-old Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\nUsers can win $1,000 is Justice Stephen Breyer throws in the robe.\nAnd a $5,000 payday will be doled out if any of the other five justices leave the Supreme Court next.", "external_links": ["http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-impeachment-bets-234931"], "published": "2017-02-14T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:13:07.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
