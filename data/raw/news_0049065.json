It is the end products of primary education that feed higher education with the prerequisite resources - the students. \nThis means if primary education produces half-baked graduates, then higher education will have a difficult task shaping these products into the ones that society needs and can easily accommodate; meaning more resources will be required to achieve this. \nEverybody agrees that the changes in the systems, curriculum, infrastructure, teaching, grading and research methods, as well as funding and policy development are long overdue. \nFor quite some time now, our education system has been notorious for producing half-baked graduates regardless of the level of education year in year out, as it is based mainly on competition as opposed to the development of knowledge and skills. \nAs a result, our education system has become synonymous with the massive failures and near collapse of the country. \nThe system and its implementers have literally killed innovation, critical thinking and creativity to the extent that we, its products, have become copy-and-paste kind of individuals. \nToday, students at all levels - from basic education to PhD - are well known for outsourcing individuals to sit for their exams, do their assignments and projects as well as research projects and other academic activities.
