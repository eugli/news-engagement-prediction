We had EXCLUSIVELY revealed to you that Aamir’s next after Thugs of Hindostan will be Rakesh Sharma’s biopic. The actor will be essaying the role of the first Indian to go to space on a mission. In fact, even before he signed up for the film, he had begun working on the script.   We had once again been the first ones to tell you about how he had already started prepping for the role of the astronaut during Dangal. It has now been reported that the movie will be helmed by Mahesh Mathias and will be produced under Siddharth Roy Kapur’s banner, Roy Kapur Films. The director is a very well known name in the advertising field. He has a lot of stellar ads to his credit and has been signed to direct this biopic. After Dangal, this will be Aamir’s second biopic. \nSpeaking of which, the astronaut’s story is the kind to talk about! Rakesh Sharma, along with Russian astronauts Yury Malyshev and Gennadi Strekalov went on a mission. For 27 days, 21 hours and 40 minutes, the trio were orbiting out in the space, conducting over 43 experimental sessions. After returning to earth, a question was asked to Sharma by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He was asked, what did India look like from outer space. To this, the astronaut had said,” Saare jahan se achcha.” Of course, keeping this in mind, it was earlier reported that the film’s name will be the same. However, it has now been revealed that the movie will be called Salute instead. ( ALSO READ – EXCLUSIVE!
