Here are a few more players currently plying their trade in the Chinese Super League... \nHulk is of course no stranger to Asian football, having spent the early portion of his career in Japan with Kawasaki Frontale, Consadole Sapporo and Tokyo Verdy. And the Brazil international has taken to the Chinese Super League like a duck to water since his return to the Far East, scoring five goals in his first nine games for SIPG. \nAnd his latest effort may just be his best yet for his new employers. \nSIPG took on FC Seoul of South Korea in an Asian Champions League game, earlier today and it was a trademark Hulk thunderbolt that settled matters in the second half. \nShanghai didn't make it easy for themselves, however, having to play the final half an hour of the match with 10 men after He Guan was adjudged to have fouled Seoul's Montenegran forward Dejan Damjanovic in the penalty area . \nDamjanovic couldn't make the advantage count, however, missing the resulting penalty as SIPG hung on for victory, thanks to Hulk's sensational golazo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:04:59.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
