She said, “The comment was not intended to be public, but it was nonetheless completely inappropriate and should not have occurred.” Murphy said editors have spoken with the reporter.\nMrs. Trump said Monday: “Applause to all women around the world who speak up, stand up and support other women!”\nApplause to all women around the world who speak up, stand up and support other women! @emrata #PowerOfEveryWoman #PowerOfTheFirstLady\n— Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) February 14, 2017", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/PowerOfEveryWoman?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/PowerOfTheFirstLady?src=hash", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/melania-trump-emily-ratajkowski-new-york-times.html", "https://twitter.com/emrata/status/831161206392107009", "https://twitter.com/emrata", "https://twitter.com/FLOTUS/status/831303325886906368"], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:40:45.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
