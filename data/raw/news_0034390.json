And the Swede's goals could be enough to secure them a Champions League place. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Huge Muller offer rejected \n“There really was something like that.\" said Dreeson. \n“Then came a fax from England. For us, however, a sale of Thomas Müller was never discussed. If a player fits us, we would be stupid to give him a short-term prospect of a record profit and to weaken him.” \nHad Muller been playing for almost any other team in Germany, it's hard to imagine such an offer being rejected and the German may well have become a Premier League player by now. Out of form \nBut Red Devils fans won't feel too aggrieved that they missed out on the 27-year-old considering the form of Ibrahimovic and the fact that Muller has netted just four times for Bayern this campaign, in all competitions. \nHeading into the Bavarian's Champions League last-16 first-leg with Arsenal, the striker hadn't found the net in five matches, while his international tally matches the numbers he has produced for Bayern so far this season. \nIt seems unlikely that United will go in for Muller again, considering the Bundesliga giants stance on the player and the form he has displayed this campaign, while Mourinho is confident of landing Griezmann during the summer. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
