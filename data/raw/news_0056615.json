What charm school did you go to, eh? You wanna tell your mum and dad to get their f money back.” \nHowever, builder Scott Deane told The Sun he saw the woman with the bike talking to a blonde man who appeared to be giving her instructions. \n\"Three guys dressed in orange site clothes turned up in a van and the blonde bloke was giving them instructions too,\" he said. \n\"He was telling the girl, ‘You need to ride behind the van aggressively'.\" \nThe footage was shared thousands of times on Wednesday, with many people taking to social media to voice their disapproval. \nAt one point, the driver can be heard shouting at the woman: \"Shut up you old dog. You on your period?\" before reaching out to try and touch her shoulder and telling her to give him her number again. \nShe is filmed sticking her middle finger up at him as the van drives off.

The van pulls up ahead and the cyclist stops abruptly next to it, quickly ripping off the driver-side wing mirror and dropping it in the middle of the road before cycling off. \nAs the motorcyclist drives past the shocked men getting out of the van, he says: \"That’s exactly what you deserve, you scum.\" \nJungle Creations’ co-owner Paul Beiboer claimed the company did not create the video and said the footage had been provided by a source it had never previously used. \nHowever, he refused to name the person or place the footage had been sourced from. \nJungle Creations did not immediately respond to The Independent ’s request for comment. \nHowever, Mr Beiboer told the Evening Standard: \"We couldn't verify its authenticity, but we don't think it's fake.\" More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:11:41.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
