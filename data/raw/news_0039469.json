Trump said he would announce a ‘‘new and very comprehensive order to protect our people’’ next week.\n‘‘This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine,’’ Trump declared in a lengthy news conference that saw the new commander in chief repeatedly interrupting reporters’ questions and airing his grievances.\nThroughout the encounter the new president delivered recurring criticism of the news media, accusing it of being ‘‘out of control’’ and promising to take his message ‘‘straight to the people.’’\nHe dismissed recent reports in The New York Times and on CNN that Trump campaign aides had been in contact with Russian officials before his election. Trump called Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager who has ties to Ukraine and Russia, a ‘‘respected man.’’\nPressed repeatedly, Trump said that ‘‘nobody that I know of’’ on his campaign staff had contacted Russian officials. He called such reports a ‘‘ruse’’ and said he had ‘‘nothing to do with Russia.’’ Trump added, ‘‘Russia is fake news. This is fake news put out by the media.’’\nAmid reports of widespread leaks within his administration, Trump also warned that he would clamp down on the dissemination of sensitive information, saying he had asked the Justice Department to investigate. ‘‘Those are criminal leaks,’’ adding, ‘‘The leaks are real. The news is fake.’’\nHe blamed any problems on the outgoing Obama administration. ‘‘I inherited a mess at home and abroad — a mess,’’ Trump said.\nDemocrats said Trump’s refusal to say for sure that his campaign staff wasn’t in contact in the Kremlin underscored the need for an independent investigation through a special congressional select committee, a commission styled after the review of the 9/11 attacks or an independent counsel from the Justice Department. ‘‘His silence speaks volumes,’’ said Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.\nThe president announced that Alexander Acosta, the dean of the Florida International University law school, would be his nominee for Labor secretary. That came a day after fast-food executive Andrew Puzder withdrew his nomination for Labor after losing support among Republican senators.\nTrump, a reality television star and real estate mogul who was elected as an outsider intent on change, said his ousted national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was ‘‘just doing his job’’ in talking with Russian officials before the inauguration. But he said he was ‘‘not happy’’ with how Flynn described his phone call with a Russian diplomat to Vice President Mike Pence.\nTrump knew for weeks that Flynn had misled Pence but did not inform the vice president, according to a timeline of events supplied by the White House.\nTrump said he had identified a strong replacement for Flynn, which made the decision to let him go easier.\nTrump is said to favor Vice Admiral Robert Harward, a former Navy SEAL, as his next national security adviser, according to a White House official. Harward met with top White House officials last week and has the backing of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. He was meeting with officials later Thursday.\nAddressing immigration, one of the biggest issues of the past campaign, Trump said it was difficult dealing with the policy known as DACA, which allows young adults to get work permits and Social Security numbers and protects them from deportation. Referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals rule, he said he would ‘‘deal with DACA with heart.’’\nWhile Trump has promised to halt illegal immigration as a cornerstone of his administration, he has also promised to focus on people who have committed crimes. He said he had the ‘‘best lawyers’’ working on the policy now and the ‘‘new executive order is being tailored to the decision we got from the court.’’\nEarlier in the day, Trump had a breakfast meeting with some of his staunchest House supporters.\nThe White House has said Trump asked for Flynn’s resignation because he had misled Vice President Mike Pence over his dealings with Russia and whether he had discussed sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. before Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. Flynn previously had denied those conversations to Pence and other top officials.\nOn Thursday, he warned in a pair of tweets that ‘‘low-life leakers’’ of classified information will be caught. As journalists were being escorted out of the breakfast meeting, Trump responded to a reporter’s question on the subject by saying: ‘‘We’re going to find the leakers’’ and ‘‘they’re going to pay a big price.’’\n___\nFollow Darlene Superville and Ken Thomas on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap and http://www.twitter.com/KThomasDC", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/KThomasDC", "http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/oVQiK_ot1XA?feature=oembed"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:12:35.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
