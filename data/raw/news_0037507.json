Once the group had reached the mosque, they asked police to seal the building and remove the Ahmadiyyas. \nBut police would not do so. “There was some frustration at the time and also quite a few people from close-by communities started coming because they learned about the incident,” Ahmed said. \nAhmed claimed the Ahmadiyyas taunted the protestors, who began to scale the walls. He said three were injured by gunfire from inside the mosque and one protester was pulled in while he was climbing and later died of a gunshot wound. \n“I mean what do you expect from a large crowd? They will sit tight and get shot at and stones throwed at them and wrong type of words used against them? There are elements, they will do something and they did it. Some of them who are youngsters tried to climb the wall. But none of the Ahmadis got hurt at all, not even a scratch.” \nI mean what do you expect from a large crowd? They will sit tight and get shot at? \nHowever, one of the dead was reportedly an Ahmadiyya who suffered a heart attack inside the mosque. The Canadian Ahmadiyya group said the man had family in the Toronto area. The dead protester was identified by the Nation newspaper as Nahmeed Shafique, 28. \nThe protesters eventually forced their way into the mosque, where they prayed, said Ahmed, who said he had negotiated with the authorities to bring it to an end. He claimed the fires seen on videos of the incident were set by Ahmadiyyas, who torched their documents and furniture before fleeing. \n“That’s nonsense,” said Choudhry, adding video footage showed otherwise. In the videos, protesters can be seen looting the mosque and throwing the contents into piles, which are later seen in flames. \nFearing he would be arrested, Ahmed said he had phoned the Canadian high commission to say “that this incident has happened and … I need your help.” But it was a Friday and the mission was closed, and he stopped using his phone.

This is what I was suggested, so immediately I was able to buy a ticket and come out. I was lucky.” Upon returning to Canada he had bypass surgery, he said. \nA Joint Investigation Team submitted a charge sheet against 61 suspects, according to a report in the Dawn newspaper, which named Ahmed as the “main suspect” and said he had fled before authorities could put his name on an exit control list. \nAhmed said he was among those Pakistani police had “unfairly” named. He said that in addition to “terrorism,” police had accused him of 10 to 12 more minor crimes but he believed the judge appointed to the case would drop charges against everyone, except against those suspected of killings and property damage. \n“This is an incident where the government is trying to protect the minorities and working against the majority. That’s why we all are punished,” said Ahmed, who said he had lived in Canada for over 40 years. \nWhy are they occupying a mosque which is built for Muslims by Muslims? \nDawn reported the Senate Committee on Human Rights had recommended the government take up Ahmed’s case with Canadian officials and seek his extradition. But Canada does not have an extradition treaty with Pakistan. \nAsked why the Ahmadiyyas could not have been left to worship at their mosque, Ahmed said that under Pakistani law Ahmadiyyas were not allowed to have mosques. “They should not have anything to do with mosques and they cannot be called Muslims,” he said. \nHe said Ahmadiyyas were free to worship but not in a mosque. “They could have used a home or build one place, no problem. But why are they occupying a mosque which is built for Muslims by Muslims? This is aggression.” \nChoudhry said Canadian Ahmadiyyas were concerned that the persecution they fled was following them to Canada. The website of an organization affiliated with a Mississauga mosque Ahmed has attended calls the Ahmadiyya faith “evil” and an attempt “by anti-Islam forces to disunite Muslims.” \nChoudhry said he hoped for a “measured response” from Canadian authorities, which could include taking action against those who “bring values that are both un-Canadian and dangerous to those living in Canada.” \nNational Post ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:40:59.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
