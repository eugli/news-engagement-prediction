If that happens for the second quarter in a row, we'll be in a technical recession . What does GDP measure? \nGDP measures all goods produced and services performed across the economy. \nSo it's counting the cost of the coffee you buy and adding the cost of paying the barista who made it. \nIt's quite the sum: the ABS is adding together company profits, wages, exports, imports, investment, construction. Basically, everything. Why is recession a bad thing? \nGDP is a measure of how an economy is performing. \nSo if it's decreased, you're looking at recession and everything that entails â€” including a probable rise in unemployment, decrease in spending and drop in living standards. \nFrom a political point of view, Australia hasn't been in a recession since 1991, and not even the global financial crisis put us into one. \nSo you don't really want to be the Prime Minister when this streak finally gets broken. What can we expect tomorrow? \nThe good news is that the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and ANZ are all expecting the economy to have grown in the last quarter of 2016. \nThat's on the back of government infrastructure spending, household consumption and exports. So we're out of the woods? \nWell, no. \nThe expectation is that annual growth will remain around 1.9 per cent. According to Trading Economics, the average rate for Australia from 1960 until 2016 was 3.49 per cent . \nSo economic growth doesn't simply equal job well done. There's growth and then there's growth . Do GDP figures tell the whole story? \nAgain, no. \nThey're a good health check for the economy, but they don't necessary tell you whether we're all getting richer or poorer. \nFor instance, a country's GDP might be growing, but if it's not keeping pace with population growth, the people themselves might not be any better off. \nSo a much better way of measuring living standards is \"GDP per capita\". According to Trading Economics, Australia was sitting at $US54,708 on that measure in 2015 . \nYou've also got to look at unemployment and income distribution to get a proper sense of economic wellbeing across the population.
