Just look to Robert Pattinson and FKA twigs, who earlier today turned out at the London premiere of Pattinson’s new film, The Lost City of Z, with their arms placed lovingly around each other. Pattinson seemed to only have eyes for FKA twigs as he whispered sweet nothings into his girlfriend’s ear, but the rest of the world took notice of their consciously coordinated red carpet wardrobe. From a fashion perspective, Pattinson is fully committed to Dior. When he showed up solo to the film’s Berlin premiere, he debuted a dapper new look from the French house, and made a compelling case for the statement coat. Once across the English Channel, Pattinson opted for Dior Homme two-button notch lapel suit in navy; doing his part to debunk the myth that you can’t wear black with blue, Pattinson accessorized with Dior’s black silk tie and black leather derbies. The unexpected combination complemented FKA twigs’s Givenchy jumper, which featured a bustier top, exposed zippers, and visible pockets, a nod to her beau’s film’s action-adventure genre. And while she hit a near-identical note in Givenchy at the BAFTAs on Sunday , the duo’s joint appearances prove that some things are just better in pairs.
