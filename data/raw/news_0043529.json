Theo Walcott left red-faced as Arsenal fans slam club for 'disrespectful' gesture \nMesut Ozil may have hoped the tide of anger would have subsided by the weekend, but a quick scroll through social media websites and a listen to the conversations in the pubs of north London will have quickly put that idea to bed. \nBut its not the fans on Twitter, Facebook or in the Twelve Pins where the most scathing rant about Arsenal and Ozil has come from, but this weekend’s edition of the Sunday Times . Ozil has been criticised for his performance on Wednesday night (Getty Images) \nFormer Liverpool great Graeme Souness has offered up as brutal a dressing down of Arsenal as you’re likely to read all week. \nAmong the 1,292 furious words – in which he warns the rest of the season could ‘get ugly’ if Arsenal don’t turn their form around – Souness picks out Ozil for particular condemnation. \n‘What we got from Arsenal epitomised all their failings,’ Souness explains of the Bayern game.
