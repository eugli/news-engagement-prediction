He’s the number one white-ball wicketkeeper in the country and brings considerable experience to the group.” \nLarsen said Munro “hasn’t quite shown the consistency he would like in the middle-order and we feel Jimmy (Neesham) is deserved of an opportunity with the bat at six.” \n“Having two frontline spinners in the side (Sodhi and Mitchell Santner) gives us flexibility and Ish is an aggressive bowler who in the right conditions can be a real threat for us.” \nSouth Africa opens its tour on Tuesday with a Twenty20 warmup match against a New Zealand XI which includes Taylor and fast bowler Adam Milne who is returning from injury. \nSquads- \nTwenty20 squad- Kane Williamson (captain), Corey Anderson, Trent Boult, Tom Bruce, Lockie Ferguson, Colin de Grandhomme, Martin Guptill, Colin Munro, James Neesham, Luke Ronchi, Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Ben Wheeler. \nODI squad- Kane Williamson (captain), Trent Boult, Neil Broom, Lockie Ferguson, Colin de Grandhomme, Martin Guptill, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, James Neesham, Luke Ronchi, Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Ish Sodhi, Ross Taylor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:53:11.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
