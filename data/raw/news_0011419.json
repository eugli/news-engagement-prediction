I really wanted the Egyptian people to be happy today and also for the players. The players fought till the end of the game,” said the disappointed Cuper on Sunday. \n“I really do not want to say that I am used to losing the final because I would have loved to win the trophy. I am very sad because I wanted the Egyptian people wanted to be happy and also for the players.” \nCuper was in charge of Real Mallorca when he inspired them to the Copa del Rey final but they lost 5-4 on penalties following a 1-all draw after extra time. \nThe following season, Mallorca reached the Uefa Cup Winners Cup final where they lost to Lazio 2-1 at Villa Park in Birmingham. \nIn 2000 and 2001, he led the unlikely Valencia to two Uefa Champions League finals but The Oranges lost to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively on penalty shootouts. \nLuck continued to escape Cuper in 2010 when he lost the Greek Cup final to Panathinaikos while in charge of Aris Thessaloniki. \nHowever, while on all occasions he was in charge of lesser experienced sides, at Afcon 2017 he inspired a rejuvenated Egypt side to the final but fell short to a more physical Cameroon team. © supersport.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:43:17.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
