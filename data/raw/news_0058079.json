Wheelihan Motor Group has filed a rezoning application and annexation petition with the city of High Point to accommodate the dealership. A public hearing on the annexation and rezoning requests will be held at 6 p.m. Tuesday during the regularly scheduled meeting of the High Point Planning and Zoning Commission. Harley-Davidson of Greensboro owner Mark Wheelihan plans to move his dealership to a… more Image provided by Getty Images Wheelihan Motor Group owner Mark Wheelihan said he would close his current Harley-Davidison of Greensboro dealership at 538 Farragut St. when the new facility opens. Wheelihan said the new facility, which he expects to be between 28,400 square feet (the footprint) and 34,000 square feet on two floors, could be ready as soon as November. He said groundbreaking would begin in late March or early April. He said the smaller upper floor would be used mostly for storage. “We’re ready to go,” Wheelihan said. “What we’re doing is building a state-of-the-art facility to replace two buildings that weren’t proper facilities. We’re not going to double deck the whole thing.” Wheelihan said the new location was in the middle of his customer base. He said he was waiting to announce a new name — it won’t be Harley-Davidson of Greensboro. The land is currently zoned as an Agricultural District in Guilford County. So approval of a change to Conditional Zoning-General Business would be conditional upon the High Point City Council’s approval of the voluntary annexation. The annexation and zoning requests could be voted on by the city council on March 20. The land is owned by James and Linda Burgio , the parents of Tara Burgio-Wheelihan , Mark's wife. Mark said the property eventually would be sold to Wheelihan Motor Group. Burgio-Wheelihan is president of family-owned Advanced Technology Inc. (ATI) Decorative Laminates. Mark Wheelihan said the new facility would be able to house more bikes inside. At Farragut Street, he can house 175 bikes for sale and servicing. The new facility will house 375. “We can carry twice as much inventory as we do now,” he said. The new showroom will be more than twice as large as his current showroom. In a letter sent to neighboring property owners by Michael S. Fox of the Tuggle Duggins law firm on behalf of Wheelihan Motor Group, the proposed dealership was described as “an attractive development, no more than two stories in height, and with no outdoor storage” that would “fit nicely within the existing parcel’s footprint.” In the mailing, Toggle Duggins included a rendering of the exterior of the dealership. Wheelihan said he sold the property he had bought adjacent to the current dealership. He said he had tried unsuccessfully for years to buy the land that the current dealership sits on since buying the dealership in 1998. Over the past 20 years, Wheelihan said the dealership’s demographics had changed. One in five of his customers are now women. Many of them have moved farther away from Greensboro. But when Tara’s family decided to sell the land, Wheelihan asked for approval from Harley-Davidson to move there, and it was granted. “We’ve got a different clientele, and we needed to be in a better area,” Wheelihan said. “The whole thing kind of started on a whim. I didn’t think Harley-Davidson would let us move.” Wheelihan said about three acres of the parcel not planned as part of the dealership could be used for a related business or sold.
