Over the weekend, Bella , Gigi , and mother Yolanda stepped out in coordinating blues for Sunday brunch in New York, and the model sisters have even been known to borrow each other’s jeans from time to time. But last night, the younger sister demonstrated a very grown-up answer to the denim jumper. The 20-year-old stepped out for the Dior Poison Club fragrance launch party in Manhattan wearing a blue cotton bustier dress that recalled the Spring 2017 designs of Maria Grazia Chiuri’s debut collection for the house—just in time for Fashion Week.

It was a barely-there look that was too pretty to cover up—hence the shaggy fur coat worn loose around her shoulders.
