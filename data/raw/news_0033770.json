(Istock) \nScience and Engineering Research Board (SERB), a statutory body under the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India has launched SERB Overseas Postdoctoral Fellowship (SERB-OPDF). \nIt is meant to encourage researchers in areas of science and engineering. The fellowship will be awarded for one year (extendable to one more year subject to evaluation). The applicant should have completed PhD degree in science and engineering not earlier than the preceding two years from recognised institutions in India. \nFor researchers who are in regular employment, the two years period may be relaxed but age should not exceed 35 years. The programme admits candidates in identified areas and sends them to top institutions around the globe, other than the US and also to institutions where internationally acclaimed scientists are working. \nApplicants who have done research in areas such as materials, energy, sustainable chemistry, theoretical mathematical science, and big data can apply.
