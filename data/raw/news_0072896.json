It was a tense final as Andrea, 60, from Cardiff, faced the Dark Destroyer, Shaun Wallace, for the show’s huge cash prize. \nIn an ideal game of The Chase each contestant will put something into the team’s pot and they will take on the chaser together in the final but for Andrea things worked out a little differently. \nThe contestant ended up facing Wallace alone with £100,000 in the bank after host Bradley Walsh sent her team members, Chris, PJ and Nat, home.
