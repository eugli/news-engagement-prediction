And how does he plan on helping Bennett? Daniel Merrett of the Lions is chaired from the field after playing his 200th and final match last year.

That’s not the best in the competition but it’s not the worst either — they were around mid-table for total tries off kicks. \nWhere they did fall down, though, was their general kicking in play. Halves Ben Hunt and Anthony Milford came under criticism for their ineffective kicks and last-tackle options, particularly late in the season. \nIn terms of forcing dropouts, the Broncos were the fourth worst in the NRL. They forced just 35 dropouts in total from their kicks, registering more than only the Tigers, Knights, and Bulldogs. In comparison premiers Cronulla forced 71 dropouts in 2016, and the Cowboys forced 70. \nBrisbane’s defence of opposition kicks was dismal in comparison to the competition. \nThe Broncos conceded 26 tries from opposition kicks last year, behind only the Dragons, who conceded 31. That’s almost a third of Brisbane’s total 83 tries conceded. \nOf those 26 tries from kicks, only nine came from a high kick. But eight of those nine came after round 17.

Source: News Corp Australia \nA LION’S PLAYBOOK \nIt makes sense that Bennett would seek the advice of a former AFL star to help with kicking and catching — skills Merrett has been drilled on since he was young. \nOn the field he was known as a hard-nut defender, but the ability to catch a ball overhead and to kick an accurate drop punt under pressure are the essentials to make it in Australian football. \nMerrett has been working with the likes of Hunt, Milford, Benji Marshall, Kodi Nikorima and Andrew McCullough to hone their kick technique. \n“It’s all about that ball drop. If you can get that ball drop straight, as opposed to it falling off your foot or going off centre, you’re halfway there,” Merrett explained to foxsports.com.au . \n“Then all it is is momentum towards the target and getting the weight of it right. \n“Generally if you’ve got a nice, straight ball drop and you’ve got momentum towards your target it’s going to get there one way or another.” Every game, every round live 0:31 \nWhen the playmakers have perfected the drop punt, Bennett will add pressure on the kickers in simulated drills so they can practice kicking in a game scenario. \nThe result will, hopefully, be the ability to land the ball on a dime more often than not when the heat is on. \nMerrett has also been working with the backs to teach them how to contest a high ball AFL-style. \nAs a tall defender Merrett’s specialty was the contested mark, and it’s a skill he says can serve NRL players just as well if they get it right. \n“I’m trying to sell the message of catching in your hands, jumping up and marking in your hands, and securing it after that,” Merrett said. \n“If you’re getting up you’re getting above the congestion, and you’re less chance of making an error. \n“If everyone just waits for it, one you’re a sitting duck, but two you’re going to get knocked off the ball and it’s difficult to catch it. \n“That’s my theory, get yourself out of congestion and get above it in a bit of clean air.” Daniel Merrett marks. Source: News Corp Australia \nWhile Merrett’s two main objectives are kicking and catching, he’s also been teaching some basic skills which could lower the Broncos’ error count. \n“There’s little things that I’ve brought across as well which is like ball handling drills, which we generally do before training or in between weight sessions.” \nTHE NEXT CODE HOPPER? \nIt could be seen as a dangerous move bringing in a cross-code coach to mingle with your club’s top talent. \nAnd Merrett admits a couple of Broncos wouldn’t look out of place with a Sherrin in hand if they ever want to ditch the Steeden. \n“Oatsy (Corey Oates) is the right size for sure. He’s a big unit, so I can see him at centre half-forward or full forward taking a mark for sure,” Merrett said. \n“David Mead can jump as well, and Jimmy Roberts can jump, they would probably be forward pockets but they can jump in the air. \n“I like Jonus Pearson as well — super athlete. I reckon he could definitely play AFL.” \nDo you live in Queensland? Want to meet a bunch of NRL legends and talk footy with them?
