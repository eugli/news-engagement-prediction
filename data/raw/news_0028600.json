Not because they’re just another international dance music group who are renowned and have worked to create some of the best trance music that we have today. But, because their music is as good as a feeling and it demands to be felt. \nI don’t remember when I started listening to Above & Beyond, for the very first time. But, I do remember the group being a very important part of my musical maturity; especially when it comes to house music. The general word around the block has always been that dance music is for amateur music lovers who don’t really know what’s beyond the bassline. The general consensus is that dance music belies the acoustics of music. © Above & Beyond \nThat’s where Above & Beyond has proven the theory wrong. The English progressive trance group, consisting of members Jono Grant, Tony McGuinness, and Paavo Siljamäki, has taken your regular house music track, crafted and customized it in such a way that it is music to your ears… with, or without the music. After creating some of the most iconic dance music tracks that had us writing them down as our contemporary living legends, they took that music, turned it around and into acoustic orchestrated symphony that was as addictive as Beethoven’s Sonata. © YouTube \nHaving formed in 2000, the turn of the century, the trio founded London-based electronic dance music labels Anjunabeats, which went on to become one of the most popular labels. Their weekly radio show titled ‘Group Therapy Radio’ became a cult in no time. \nThe reason is simple. Because they didn’t restrict their musical prowess to one genre, or property. They knew that music needs to be diversified in order to touch more than one mind and more than one soul. They understand the essence of melody and that music has a soul. Somehow, they manage to find just the right balance between soulful music, heartfelt lyrics and mind-numbing rhythm to let you lose yourself in the music. They invested their efforts, passions and arts into music in every form. That’s why they’re Above & Beyond. And that’s why watching them perform in India next month is worth every penny, second and ounce of energy spent. © Submerge India \nPhoto: © The Trance Project (Main Image)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T14:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:20:49.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
