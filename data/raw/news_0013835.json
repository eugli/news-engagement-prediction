Every club has a group who know deep down that if everyone is fit and on form, the realistic hope is for a place on the bench, some cup games, and the odd crack when the first choice in their position needs a breather. The art of fine management includes an ability to make those players feel wanted, valued, and motivated to be ready to step up and step in the second they are needed. \nMauricio Pochettino keeps that in mind around the training ground and wants that inclusive atmosphere to permeate Spurs Lodge. “You know, it’s teamwork,” he says. “Football is a collective thing, but it’s not only 11 players. It’s 25 players, and the 25 players need to be always ready to fight and be available to give the best every time that you need them.” Mauricio Pochettino still learning four years into his search for perfection | Amy Lawrence Read more \nIt has been one of the extraordinary aspects of Spurs’ defensive record – the best in the Premier League with a mere 16 goals conceded – that they have done so without core defenders at different periods of the campaign. Danny Rose is the latest to spend some time out, joining Jan Vertonghen on the injury list, while Toby Alderweireld missed two months not so long ago. Together with Kyle Walker most would agree that makes the first-choice back line. \nEven though Pochettino made a habit of changing his full-backs last season, he started this term keener on that established back four. But they have been able to link up as a quartet in just eight of the 24 games. “When you play in four competitions, plus the international games, sometimes it’s not the number one that will be decisive to achieve big things. Maybe it’s the player that is waiting for his moment that, in a key game, in a key period of the season, you need to put in and they need to perform well and help the team,” the manager says. \n“Sometimes you win games because the performance of the player that replaces your number one is good, and in 10 minutes changes the game, and you can win. I think we need to talk about that with more respect to the people that are waiting for the possibility to play. For me they are not a number, they are people that feel, that have emotions, and it’s very, very tough when you cannot give the possibility to play, and then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, they are training hard, hard, hard. The people that do not play train harder than the players that are involved on the weekend. That is the value and you can appreciate that.” \nThis philosophy is reflected in those who have come into the team, like Ben Davies and Kevin Wimmer slotting in at the back. Eric Dier has repositioned himself comfortably when called upon. Pochettino says that the team’s defensive attitude owes something to the whole squad. \n“It is not because of the goalkeeper and centre-back and full-back – it is about the organisation of the team, and that is not only 11 but 25 players who work a lot. They need to be organised and focused   ball, work hard on pressing and closing and fighting.” \nHe is also pleased with the number of players in his squad who bring leadership qualities. As well as the usual suspects, starting from Hugo Lloris, who brings his experience as captain for club and country, the Tottenham manager picked out Dele Alli as one whose influence is evolving. “Alli’s personality and character, maybe he becomes a leader in a few years,” he says. \nTottenham are intent on maintaining those hungry qualities as they head to Liverpool for a match Pochettino accepts has an extra resonance. He is still very much looking upwards, not over his shoulder. “We are not the only realistic challengers,” he says. “We are next after Chelsea and it’s a fact we are a contender today. Then there are a lot of teams who are contenders. Nine points is a massive gap but it is not decisive.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:37:54.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
