Who was Max Stern? Dr Stern fled Germany in 1937 and was interred as an enemy alien in a refugee camp on the British Isle of Man Two years later the British government allowed him to immigrate to Canada Dr Stern is remembered as an icon in the art community and gave generously to museums across Canada \nMaria Vullo heads a small investigative team in New York called the Holocaust Claims Processing Office that tracks down art and other assets stolen by the Nazis. \n\"Dr Stern was a victim of legalized persecution in his native Germany due to his religion,\" she said. \n\"That caused him to become, in turn, a refugee, 'an enemy alien', 'a civilian alien', and finally in his new home in Montreal a successful and influential art dealer.\" \nMs Vullo said Dr Stern took measures to ensure his art might be recovered one day. \n\"Although Dr Stern did not live to see the return of his art, he had hope for the future. \n\"He bequeathed his assets including his interest in recovered art work to three non-profit institutions of higher learning, hoping for days like today when restitution would happen.\" Many stolen artworks never recovered \nIt has taken years, if not decades, of painstaking investigation for the artwork to be returned. \nThe art world is notoriously secretive, and so much art is hidden away on the walls of people who might know nothing about its provenance.

(AP: Mary Altaffer) \nOne day the investigators discovered and confirmed the painting was in New York, and they alerted the FBI, whose agents, including Michael McGarrity, moved in. \n\"The painting has wandered the globe for nearly 80 years since being forced into sale under the auspices of the Nazi regime,\" Mr McGarrity said. \n\"Young Man as Bacchus was most recently owned by the Luigi Caretto Gallery in Turin, Italy. \n\"The gallery, with no knowledge of the painting's unfortunate past, had consigned it for sale at an art fair in New York City recently, in 2015. \n\"The FBI seized the painting after being made aware of its existence at the fair and today we return it to the rightful owners, the Stern Foundation.\" \nThe Dutch masterpiece is the 16th of Dr Stern's German artworks that investigators have managed to track down. \nAt an official ceremony at New York's Museum of Jewish Heritage, Museum's CEO Michael Glickman handed the artwork over to representatives of the Stern Foundation. \n\"Today is yet another example of an opportunity to provide justice to the memory of Dr Max Stern, who managed Gallery Stern in Dusseldorf, Germany,\" Mr Glickman said. \n\"From the most unjust of times, a measure of justice is restored today.\" \nOf Dr Stern's 400 lost works, hundreds are still missing and may never be found. \nBut investigators said the recovery of Young Man as Bacchus was a small symbol of justice to those who suffered the unspeakable horrors of the Holocaust.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:12:34.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
