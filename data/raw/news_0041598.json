We include all genders and the sport is non-binary’ meaning you can play Quidditch as the gender you identify as, not as the gender you were assigned at birth.” Quidditch competition between University students \nIt is also one of the cheapest sports clubs to join at University, its membership is only £5 a year and provides the kit, as well as equipment (broomsticks). Quidditch gives students from all backgrounds the opportunity to represent their University in sport. \nBen said: \"No one has played it before university so it’s one of the only sports which you all start on a level playing field. Whereas something like football people will have practiced for years. Read More Is this REALLY the worst hotel in Manchester? We check in to find out \n\"It’s a high-intensity game. I love quidditch because everyone is relaxed and friendly off the pitch. But on the pitch, people are competitive and want to win.’ \nWhile the teams aren’t all fans of J.K.Rowling’s books they have all taken the personality quiz which tells you which house you belong to. Gryffindor house is for the brave, Slytherin for the cunning, Ravenclaw for the clever and Hufflepuff for the kind. In pictures: Qudditch in Manchester View gallery \nBen said the results were fairly uniform across the team, ‘It’s somewhere along the lines of 70 per cent Gryffindor, 20 per cent Slytherin, 10 per cent of the other two houses.’ \nThe Quidditch championship took place on Saturday at Platt fields park in Wilmslow. Seven teams competed for the Cottonopolis Cup -0 named in tribute to Manchester’s past - Chester Centurions Liverpuddly Cannons, Manchester Manticores, Preston Poltergeists, Queen’s University Belfast and the Sheffield Squids. HOW TO PLAY QUIDDITCH Quidditch competition between University students \nThe sport is ridiculously complicated, even the character Hagrid couldn’t explain it to Harry Potter, saying: ‘It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like – like soccer in the Muggle world – everyone follows quidditch – played up in the air on broomsticks and there are four balls – sorta hard ter explain the rules’ \nNow Quidditch has entered the non-magical world it is equally difficult to explain. It is a hybrid of netball, lacrosse, tag-rugby and dodgeball. \nThe bludgers take the form of dodgeball - if a player is hit by the bludger ball when holding the quaffle ball they have to drop the ball and run back to their team’s goals. Read More \nThe broomsticks are just sticks that players have to carry between their legs, which makes running and catching much harder. \nTo score points the team must throw the Quaffle ball into the opposing team’s hoops. \nThe snitch takes the form of an impartial person who is brought on after 15 minutes of play. Much like tag rugby the person playing the snitch must avoid having their tag pulled off. When the snitch has been caught the game ends.
