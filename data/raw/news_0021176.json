Hubbs made much of it happen, too, with a steal, an assist and six points during the Vols’ game-ending, 15-2 run. \nHubbs — who hit the go-ahead shot on a tough, left-handed bucket and added two free throws moments later to push that lead to two scores — said moments after the game that he still didn’t feel great physically but would sleep a lot better Wednesday night than he did after the Vols’ late collapse and loss at at Mississippi State on Saturday. \nThe 6-foot-5 senior from rural West Tennessee said he was happy to see the Vols turn the screws on an opponent in the closing minutes — something they’ve struggled with much of the season. \n“We went out there and just took it,” Hubbs said. “We made big-time plays when we needed ‘em, and we went out there and took it.” \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .) \nHubbs said Tennessee’s entire team — even him, as the team’s most experienced player — is learning what it takes to grind out games like Wednesday, and he hopes to see that trend continue during the Vols’ February fight for an NCAA Tournament spot. \n“We’re all learning — including me, you know?” Hubbs said. “We’re all learning that in the last four or five minutes, you’ve got to go out there and take it. You can’t be hesitant. You have to be the aggressor.” \nTennessee (14-10, 6-5 SEC) is back at home Saturday to face Georgia (13-11, 4-7) before traveling to 15th-ranked Kentucky (19-5, 9-2) for a Valentine’s Day showdown in Rupp Arena. \n\nContact Wes Rucker by email at wesrucker247@gmail.com or ON TWITTER , or FOLLOW GOVOLS247 ON FACEBOOK .
