Daily Edition Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers Mock Trump’s Media Criticism 4:00 PM PST 12/31/1969 by Jennifer Konerman COMMENTS YouTube/The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Colbert also spoke about the nonexistent \"Bowling Green Massacre\": \"Just because it didn’t happen, doesn’t mean it wasn’t an inside job.\" \nPresident Trump's recent attacks against the media did not go unnoticed by late-night hosts. \nStephen Colbert and Seth Meyers were among the hosts who addressed the president's comments about the \"dishonest press,\" along with his adviser Kellyanne Conway's comments about nonexistent tragedies. \nTrump, speaking in Florida about extremist attacks , said that “it’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported. And in many cases, the very very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.” \n“The president is accusing the media of refusing to cover major terror attacks,\" said Colbert on Monday's Late Show . \"Why? Reasons. It makes perfect sense. You know the old news adage: If it bleeds, don’t talk about it.” \nMoving on to the “Bowling Green Massacre,” a nonexistent event that Conway has mentioned to MSNBC, TMZ and Cosmopolitan, Colbert declared himself a \"Bowling Green truther.\" Several news networks have also fired back against her claim that the media never covered the event, with CNN tweeting: \"Kellyanne Conway is right. We did not cover the Bowling Green massacre -- because it never happened.\" \n“Yes, it didn’t get covered,” said Colbert, “on the flimsy excuse that there was no Bowling Green Massacre. But I think we all remember where we weren’t were when we didn’t hear that nothing had happened.” \n“I say they need to present both sides of the story: The things that did happen, and the things that didn’t happen,\" added Colbert. \"Then let the victims of the Bowling Green Massacre decide if they were killed.” \n“Just because it didn’t happen, doesn’t mean it wasn’t an inside job,” he said. “That’s why I’m a Bowling Green truther. I demand that the media not release the reports they did not do on the attacks that did not occur. And I will not rest until they don’t.” \n“My sacred promise is to you: We will have more on this story as it doesn't develop.” \nLate Night's Seth Meyers presented a \"Closer Look\" about Trump's travel ban and recent comments about the press. \nMeyers said that the rollout of Trump's ban \"is so bad, in fact, that Trump's advisers are now making up fake tragedies to try and justify it,\" speaking about Conway's \"Bowling Green Massacre.\" \n\"Now if you were embarrassed you didn't remember the Bowling Green Massacre, don't be. It's an incident that never happened. Like the Titanic crashing into the Hindenburg, or when Lee Harvey Oswald was shot by a unicorn.\" \n\"Even when they're lying, they're distracting us from other, worse lies,\" he said of the Trump administration. \"That's like telling people you have a girlfriend in Canada when really, you have a dead body in the basement.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:33:08.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
