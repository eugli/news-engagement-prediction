We definitely don't want to see the match end in two and a half days.\"\nAustralia beat India at their own spin game on the bone-dry Pune track used for the venue's Test debut. O'Keefe and spin partner Nathan Lyon claimed all 10 Indian wickets in the hosts' second innings.\n\"We like to keep some moisture underneath. So we haven't stopped watering it,\" Rao added.\n\"We'll water it until two or three days before the match. Then we will see what the pitch looks like, two days out, and take a call.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T12:56:20.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
