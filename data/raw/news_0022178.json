And in this trailer for his upcoming movie Aftermath , he has an even better reason to be pissed off. In the trailer, he plays a regular, muscle-bound man with an Austrian accent whose family dies in a tragic plane crash that was caused by the negligence of an air traffic controller played by Scoot McNairy. But when the airplane company tries to pay him off with a few thousand dollars and sends McNairy to a new life where he can be freed from his guilt, Schwarzenegger flips out. Granted, this looks like more of a grown-up thriller than your usual Schwarzenegger action movie, but theyâ€™ll probably save the scene where he kills McNairy with a minigun for the actual film. \nAftermath was directed by Elliott Lester, and it will be in theaters on April 7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:07:03.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
