So, they are afraid. ... I am tightening the screws to teach those supporting black money a lesson\".Attacking the SP government, Modi said \"past governments in UP worked in such a manner that it led to the closure of famous Aligarh lock industry as they could not provide enough electricity.\"Mocking the state government, Modi said if electricity was supplied, people can enjoy that power. Ironically, the Prime Minister had taken a similar jibe during his election campaign for Bihar last year.He attacked the state government for \"doing nothing for development\" and accused it of neither checking corruption, casteism and nepotism, nor clearing the cane farmers' dues.\"Youths were asked to pay bribe and bring recommendation for interviews by MLAs and Ministers. Poor have to mortgage land and assets to pay. This has to be stopped. Our central government had stopped interviews for class three and four.The selection has been computerised on the basis of marks earned by a candidate,\" the Prime Minister said. He said people will be surprised to know that what magic Modi has done which has resulted in Rs 10000 crore of annual saving. \"By introducing cheap LED bulbs, we have reduced electricity bills,\" Modi said.Hitting out at the opposition for saying there was lack of planning by the government regarding its demonetisation decision, he defended the move saying there was sufficient planning for note ban to find out the details of all the money being deposited in the banks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T12:56:33.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
