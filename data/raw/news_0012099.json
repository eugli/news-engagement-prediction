Rescuers tried repeatedly to get to the three, trapped about 60m underground, but had to withdraw as more ground collapsed. \nThe search was suspended indefinitely when the mine’s Australian owners, Vantage Goldfields, said they needed R200m to continue the rescue mission and resume operations. \nThe mine was placed under business rescue. Subsequently, the company’s nearby Barbrook mine was also placed under business rescue as it had to bear the costs of closing the Lily Mine. \nAccording to Fin24, Zwane was adamant that the holding company and its business rescue practitioner remain liable for the payment of R200 000 to the three families, as well as R50 000 each to the survivors. \nMahlangu said Zwane’s department had a responsibility to ensure that this is realised. \n\"Decisive action will quell growing perception that the ministry is protecting the interests of big business at the expense of mining communities and miners, some of who could be without jobs following the tragic incident which has robbed them of their livelihoods,\" he said. \nThe delay was \"setting bad precedence that might hamper sustainable mining and maintenance of a culture of zero harm in the mining sector\", Mahlangu added.
