Tom Hardy in Taboo 26 February 2017 • 7:00am \nW arning: contains major spoilers for season one of Taboo \nAfter a blood-soaked conclusion, we now know that the second series of Taboo will be missing several of its main characters. The body count for the finale was high: Sir Stuart exploded, Zilpha jumped to her death from a bridge, and fake American patriot Dr Dumbarton was drowned in his own red, white and blue dyes. \nAs James Delaney and his small surviving band of allies sail off into the horizon, here are the questions we'll be pondering until they return for series two. 1. Will Delaney ever reach Nootka? \nYes – but it may take him a long time to get there. In an interview with Deadline , writer Stephen Knight was asked whether later episodes would be set in North America. \"Not certainly in this first eight hours, but we have plans – well, certainly I have plans – if we get given the green light for more,\" he said. Jessie Buckley as Lorna Credit: BBC \n\"The plan is that there would be three seasons, and, as with Peaky Blinders , I have had a destination in mind from the beginning, because I think it helps as a writer. The destination in mind is that James Keziah Delaney sets foot on Nootka Sound. But that’s a long way off.\" \nI n the mean time, Delaney has another destination in mind: Ponta Delgada, capital of the Azores, on São Miguel Island. But why is he going there? Good question. From Atticus to Zilpha: what the cast of Taboo look like out of character 2. Will romance blossom between Dr Cholmondeley and Lorna Bow-Delaney? \nI n internet parlance, \"shipping\" is the desire to see a relationship develop between two popular figures. Ever since the Tom Hollander's debauched doctor took a shine to Jessie Buckley's fiery actress, some Taboo viewers have been \"shipping\" the couple. But, in a novel twist, this time it could actually involve shipping: the pair are quite literally in the same boat, with nowhere else to go for the foreseeable future. \nCould the cramped living conditions bring them together? One thing's for sure: fans will struggle to make a cute Hiddleswift -style portmanteau out of Cholmondeley and Bow-Delaney. Scroobius Pip as French Bill Credit: BBC 3. Will French Bill finally get some proper screen-time? \nB earded rapper Scroobius Pip only had a limited role in this series, as rowdy brigand French Bill, one of Atticus's cohort of heavies. But French Bill is now just one of a small handful of characters who have made it onto Delaney's ship alive. As a result, we're likely to see more of him in the new series; this shady, ill-defined character could at last get a proper narrative arc. We might even find out why they all call a bearded cockney \"French\". Louis Serkis (right) with Tom Hollander in Taboo Credit: BBC 4. Who is Robert? \nP layed by Louis Serkis (son of Gollum actor Andy Serkis) young Robert is still a mystery. Initially, we were told he was the son of Horace Delaney, making him James's half-brother. But Cholmondeley is convinced he is in fact James's Delaney's son. If James is the father, is Zilpha the mother? And if it's not her, then who could it possibly be? What do Delaney's tattoos mean? Credit: BBC 5. What is the real nature of Delaney's supernatural powers? \nD elaney is characteristically evasive on the subject of what he got up to in Africa, but he seems to have picked up a very unusual range of skills. So far, we've seen him communing with the dead, and using some to have his way with Zilpha . But is that the extent of his talents? And what is the meaning behind his tattoos? Credit: BBC 6. What does James Delaney really want? \nT his is the $64,000 question. He told the East India Company he wanted a lucrative monopoly on the trade in sea otter pelts, but it's hard to believe Delaney's plan is just a get-rich-quick scheme. He has proven, time and again, that he's a man with nothing to live for. It's hard to imagine him enjoying his limitless riches, dining on ostrich eggs and buying expensive waistcoats. \nSo what really motivates him? One possible answer: guilt. Haunted by the ghosts of the slaves whose deaths he caused, and distressed by the memory of his ill-used Native American mother, Delaney wants to leave this world with a clean slate. He's already helped George Chichester to secure a kind of justice for the African slaves, and now the next step is to make reparations in North America. He doesn't want Nootka Sound for himself - he wants to return it to the Nootkans. \nAt least, that's one theory. Or maybe he's just in it for the otters. We'll have to wait and see.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T09:13:27.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
