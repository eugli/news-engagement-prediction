People love it!\" \nThe large and rather oily tentacled creature looks rather alarming before being fully cooked . \nToday's show was hosted by chef Matt Tebutt, and featured The Saturdays singer Una Healy.

She did have a nice cod at her wedding, so clearly isn't against maritime food at all. \nUna married rugby star Ben Foden in her native Ireland back in 2012, after four years of dating. They have two children, Aoife Belle, 4 and Tadhg John, 2.
