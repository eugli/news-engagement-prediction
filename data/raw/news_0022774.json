Good feeling. Marty Silk AAP Share on Twitter \nAUSTRALIANS are missing out on billions of dollars of potential savings, a new credit score service has claimed. \nPeople with high credit scores can leverage their reliability to negotiate better deals with banks, lenders, credit card providers and power and phone companies, many people don’t know how to check their score — or that they can improve it. \nA new survey by Credit Simple, which launched in Australia on Thursday, shows 85 per cent of Australians think they should be able to use a high score to get better deals on interest repayments and bills, but don’t realise they can. \nCredit scores are a rating between zero and 1000 that indicate an individual’s financial history and determine eligibility for loans, credit cards and financial contracts such as phone plans. \nA high score means you’re more attractive to lenders, while a low score makes you less attractive. \nConsumers have a legal right to obtain their score once a year, or if they’ve been recently knocked back for credit, through one of three credit reporting bodies — Dun & Bradstreet via its new Credit Simple venture, VEDA via GetCreditScore.com.au , and Experian Credit Services . \nCredit Simple chief executive David Scognamiglio said many credit providers were open to providing better deals to people with high scores, and that an analysis of RBA data showed consumers with good scores could save $864 a year on average by negotiating with their lenders or utilities. \nCredit Simple offers potentially better deals to users of its site by making targeted offers from utility, insurance, telco and other companies with which it has a commission arrangement. \nMr Scognamiglio more than half of consumers didn’t realise they could improve their credit scores. \nHe said 63 per cent of consumers had a credit score of 700 or above — considered “great”— and could improve it by contacting a current or former lender, utility or phone company and working out how to correct a default or late payment. \n“If you’ve got a credit default on your file and it was from a late phone bill four years ago but you’ve been paying your bills wonderfully well since, why shouldn’t you be able to fix that and tell the financial community you’re a good payer?” he said. \nConsumers are allowed to contact their creditors and ask them to erase mistakes on their credit reports. \nIf negative reports are indisputable, consumers can also ask for a “goodwill adjustments” or for a negative entry to be completely erased, although this often involves having to pay an outstanding balance. \nMr Scognamilio said even those with a poor score below 500 can improve their rating by getting financial advice on how to improve it. \nWHAT YOUR CREDIT SCORE MEANS \n• 1000 — This is the 3.5 per cent of consumers who have been dubbed “credit unicorns”, as they are in the best financial position possible. To join their ranks, watch your score closely and keep paying bills and loans on time to ensure your ranking doesn’t drop. \n• 800-999 — This is the 22 per cent who have a superb rating. They should speak to banks, telcos and energy providers regularly to ensure they’re getting a good deal. \n• 700-799 — This is the 41 per cent who have a great rating. They are in a strong position to negotiate better deals, but probably haven’t been doing so. \n• 500-699 — This is the 23 per cent who are about average. Often, people without much credit history fall into this category. Make sure you do your homework before applying for loans or signing contracts. \n• 300-499 — This is the three per cent who, frankly, need to up their game. People fall into this category for failing to pay bills on time or even a recent default. Check your credit score regularly to ensure there are no surprises. \n• 0-299 — This is the 7.7 per cent of people who are not doing so well. People in this area likely have unpaid defaults or a bankruptcy on their files. They should start by ensuring bills and loans are paid on time and seek financial advice. \n(Source: Credit Simple)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T12:33:12.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
