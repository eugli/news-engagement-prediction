A fucking hat,” NY Post reports. \nWhen speaking of Santos’ sister, who is reportedly named Jessica, the man said to two of his co-workers, “I don’t even want to think about what she’s going through.” \nWitnesses of the scene tell the NY Post Santos appeared to have died as soon as she hit the floor. One construction worker said, \nThere was a lot of blood. That was it. There was nothing you could do. She wasn’t going to make it … and the way she was laying… \nSantos’ sister reportedly screamed and rushed over to her twin’s body immediately after the fall. According to reports, she is now in a local hospital being treated for trauma. \nThis is the first death to occur at the Oculus. It cost $3.9 billion to build and was opened in March 2016. It was built to replace the New Jersey PATH terminal that was destroyed in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
