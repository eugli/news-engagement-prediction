This is just soul destroying. - Alex Zaia (@zaiaalex) February 4, 2017 Arsenal fans on hearing arsene wenger has sighed a new 8m a year 2yr contract next month #afc pic.twitter.com/pEPwaNGN9S", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:35:44.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
