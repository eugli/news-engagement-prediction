Karni Sena to host a press conference, team Padmavati scared to the hilt! Faridoon Shahryar Feb 14, 2017 - 10:14 am IST 0 0 \nLokendra Singh Kalvi of Shree Rajput Karni Sena will address a press conference at the Press Club in New Delhi today afternoon to point out the issues that he has with Sanjay Leela Bhansali ‘s film Padmavati . I called up the Publicist who had sent me the email invite and asked him that when Mr Kalvi had already addressed a press conference on this matter earlier, why is it that he is addressing another press conference? The name of the publicist was Sumit and he told me that Mr Kalvi will address the issues and how Bollywood falsely presents history ( Jodhaa Akbar for example). I asked if they have an objection to the title Padmavati ? Sumit replied in the affirmative. \nWhile the Karni Sena will be addressing their second press conference and their representatives have appeared in television debates, team Padmavati has been conspicuous with their disappearing act. Apart from Shahid Kapoor no one has spoken up. They have issued a press release stained with the ink of extreme fear. Arshad Warsi recently told me that any random organisation can come up and slap a powerful person and achieve their immense fame. He had lamented that the apathetic attitude of the law enforcing agencies is disheartening. While celebrities are voicing their opinion in big numbers against the dictatorial orders of Trump during the Baftas, Grammys and other award shows, Indian celebrities continue to remain tight lipped and very very afraid. The more you remain silent, the more you will be suppressed. Start hunting for ‘safe subjects’ Bollywood!
