The approval process is expected to take a few days each time.\nThe operating history of the bar or lounge will be reviewed to make sure it has a record of being safe, Robinson said.\nOnly a very small number of venues in the province have been deemed unsafe by the AGLC, although Robinson said he couldn't give any details on what qualifies as unsafe.\nThe policy change is welcome news, said David Shepherd, MLA for Edmonton-Centre, and a musician himself.\n\"This is a great step forward for our music scene, for young performers, and for our province as a whole,\" Shepherd said. \"It makes areas like Edmonton's downtown a much more attractive place to visit and to live.\"\nThe Needle Vinyl Tavern on Jasper Avenue offers live music performances.\nIt will be interesting to see all the young talent that comes through the doors, said Rebecca Thede, events coordinator at The Needle Vinyl Tavern.
