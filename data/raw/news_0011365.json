Tokyo, move over. Here’s a look at two new restaurants that embody the trend. Photo: Courtesy of Shuhari Shuhari is the Japanese art of mastery; originally referring to martial arts.Approximate translation of the word shuhari, from the Japanese: shu : Learn it. ha : Make it your own. ri : Perform it instinctually. Add into the definition of the word ha , the notion of “disrupt it,” and you’ll be close to the concept of the new hot spot in Venice—and a possible new life philosophy, if you want to take it to the creative edge. Shuhari, the tea salon on Abbot Kinney, takes matcha and latte and an interesting twist on tea sandwiches (read: triangle-shaped treats with rice and seaweed on both sides, one filled with chicken dotted with salted plum, another with sriracha-smothered crab and avocado) and creates a new, exciting street version of café food (reminiscent of what Nobu Matsuhisa did to sushi in L.A. in the ’80s) set in a tiny, finely calibrated minimalist coffee shop setting. There’s free WiFi. And did I mention the ice cream sundaes? In this particularly fractious time, I’m looking for Zen anywhere I can . . . and the idea of a ritual green tea ceremony performed by a tea master was very appealing. It’s raining, but the floor-to-ceiling front window is open wide, hinged like a door so that it looks almost like a modern-day rendition of a Japanese tatami house. The back garden, a usually blissful place to hang out, is closed due to the unexpected, much welcomed, almost torrential (and apparently weeks-long) Los Angeles rainstorm. Inside at the small, somewhat communal tables, there’s a sense of privacy as all the patrons respectfully sit quite close to one another but keep to themselves, and the staff is so well trained and obliging that it almost seems like they’re cheerfully tiptoeing, anticipating your every whim whether it’s flavored, hot, or iced green tea or a matcha sparkler with fresh lemon, mint, or yuzu. The soda water is infused in-house, and sometimes the mixture itself gets overexcited (which is part of the fun), like a Champagne bottle, overflowing and bursting in bubbles. Hold your glass up and say, “Kanpai.” See, don’t you feel better already? Feel free to shop, simple but exquisite Japanese china for sale (Hakusan Porcelain, founded in 1779) on a table, plain white and perfectly Zen. And then there’s the amazing quantity of handcrafted loose Japanese tea, the likes of which you need to be a tea master to understand but that anyone can appreciate, taking artisanal tea to a new level. The ceremony itself is somewhat magical. The elegant Take Yamamura, whose quiet countenance is balanced by a slightly mischievous and wise twinkle in his eye and the casual, intense confidence he employs to stir up the magical matcha tea. He tells me that his mother is also a tea master. (Yes, it runs in the family.) Although she has a teaching license in Nagoya city, Japan, she did not teach him the art. He came to it later when he learned it at Shuhari. He has his own version of the translation of Shuhari: shu : Teach. ha : Shake it up. ri : Make it mine. Instinctually, almost without measuring, he scoops exactly the right amount of matcha tea powder, while with his other hand, he softens a bamboo brush in water, and then with the brush, gently and ceremoniously whisks hot water and the matcha tea, miraculously stirring the whole concoction with the precision and concentration of a downhill ski racer, which magically turns the bright green color of Tinker Bell’s dress. Remember, it’s caffeinated, especially if you’re looking for Zen . . . Photo: Courtesy of Sumo Dog Sumo Dog And this new East-Meets-West L.A. cuisine may actually be a trend. The Coachella festival’s hottest food stand has gone brick and mortar. It opened last month on an ultra-hip strip of Western Avenue in Koreatown. Think all American: perfectly grilled hot dogs with a south of the border edge mixed with ultra-Japanese toppings—nori sushi, jalapeño, scallions, teriyaki sauce, cilantro, and that’s only a start. My favorite is the signature Sumo Dog, doused with pickled peppers, wasabi relish (which I wish they would bottle), spicy mayo, teriyaki sauce, minced onion, furikake (whatever that is), and kizami nori. And there’s The Godzilla, a beef hot dog smothered with spicy pork chili and practically everything else in the house; the Miso Katsu, yes, it’s actually breaded with panko and fried; a Loco Moco (sort of Sumo Dog’s version of a croque madame) topped with a fried egg; and, if you insist, a vegan dog with spicy tofu chili. Except for the vegan, it sounds over the top, but don’t be fooled, the ingredients are mostly organic, handpicked, and carefully curated. The beef hot dogs are from Snake River Farms; the pork hot dogs from Olympia Provisions; and the potato buns are flown in from a bakery in Ohio, which isn’t surprising as it’s the brainchild of chef Jeffrey Lunak, who earned served as executive chef at Masaharu Morimoto’s Napa Valley restaurant and similarly former alum Morimoto’s stellar restaurant consultant Mark Stone. Not surprisingly, they’re already talking about a second spot, either in Venice or Downtown. They also serve house-made lemongrass lemonade and the Japanese soda Ramune (the one with the marble in the bottle). Take a seat at the bar and listen to the radio playing softly (no televisions here) and order a side of Sumo Style Sushi Rice Tots, their version of chili cheese fries: chili, cheese, jalapeño, teriyaki, et cetera, served over an interesting version of fried white rice. And if you’re still hungry, there are four kinds of mochi; a soy milk soft serve; and something called a Chocoyaki (Nutella and condensed milk), which is probably guaranteed to give you a three-hour sugar rush, just in case you ate too many hot dogs!
