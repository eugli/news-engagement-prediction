In a United Nations Security Council resolution passed in December 2016, Israeli settlements were denounced as a \"flagrant violation of international law\".\nEuropean foreign policy on Israel/Palestine is based on the two-state solution and the applicability of international law in the occupied Palestinian territories , Lovatt noted. A number of European Union member states have issued advisories to businesses warning against the financial, legal and reputational risks associated with dealing with Israeli entities involved in settlement activities.\n\"There is this issue of a possible violation of international law. This is the general issue about providing material assistance in support of Israel's unlawful activities, which is a pretty clear-cut case of assisting in the violation of the Geneva Convention and other unlawful practices,\" Lovatt told Al Jazeera.\nThe Danwatch list of companies consists of Israeli and international publicly-traded companies with activities in the occupied territories, including those in the security, communications, financial and construction sectors.\nThe 36 companies on our list are not in compliance with UN guidelines because they contribute in varying degrees to a negative impact on the human rights of Palestinians.\nMikkel Bahl , journalist \n\"The 36 companies on our list are not in compliance with UN guidelines because they contribute in varying degrees to a negative impact on the human rights of Palestinians,\" Mikkel Bahl, a journalist who worked on the investigation, told Al Jazeera.\nIn its Guiding Principles on business and human rights, the UN sets out corporate responsibility guidelines, stating that businesses should avoid infringing on the human rights of others and address instances where they are involved in harming human rights.\n\"These pension funds all have policies for responsible investments on their websites, where they refer to UN and [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] guidelines,\" Bahl said.\n\"They tell their customers that they follow these international guidelines and make sure that they don't contribute to a negative effect on human rights.\"\nThe biggest investor named in the investigation is the Norwegian government's pension fund, Statens Pensjonsford Utland, which has 5.2bn euros ($5.6bn) in investments spread across all of the companies listed.\n\nTwo Dutch funds, Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP and Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzijn, both have multimillion-dollar investments in a number of companies, including Caterpillar, which supplies bulldozers that are used to demolish Palestinian homes in the occupied territories.\nSwedish fund, Alecta Pensionsforsakring, has investments in a single company on the list, Volvo Group, whose excavators are used in demolitions of Palestinian property . Volvo also partly owns the Israeli bus-maker Merkavim, which supplies armoured buses used on roads in the occupied territories.\nInside Story - Does the Two-State Solution still have a future? Finally, the Danish fund, Arbejdsmarkedets Tillaegspension (ATP), has investments in Priceline Group Inc, which owns Booking.com, a travel portal that allows the booking of hotel rooms in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and Siemens, which has delivered a traffic control system for Israeli roads in the West Bank.\nAsked to respond to the Danwatch report, Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP noted that in the coming years, it would \"re-evaluate and decide which listed companies make for responsible and sustainable investments and will therefore be included in its investment portfolio\".\nPensioenfonds Zorg en Welzijn told Al Jazeera in a statement that \"of all the companies in which we invest, we require that they comply with internationally agreed standards when it comes to the environment, social conditions and human rights\", without specifically addressing how the issue of support for Israeli settlements fits into that assessment.\nNBIM, which administers the Statens Pensjonsfond Utland fund, noted that some companies in the region were excluded from the fund \"due to serious violations of individuals' rights in a situation of war or conflict\", but did not specifically comment on the companies named by Danwatch, which were not on a provided list of exclusions.\nAlecta declined to comment, while ATP said that after the Danwatch report, it had investigated the specifics of the two companies in which it was investing, and did not find their activities to be of a controversial nature.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T13:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:02:37.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
