Counting of votes began at 10 AM.\nAbout 56 per cent voters had on Tuesday exercised franchise across 10 municipal corporations in Maharashtra, including for the all-important Mumbai civic body BMC which recorded a 55 per cent turn-out.\nBJP and its bickering ally in the state government Shiv Sena, who could not form an alliance for the civic poll in the megapolis or elsewhere this time, fought keenly, lashing out freely at each other during the bitter campaign. The turn-out for 11 zilla parishads and 118 panchayat samiti polls was 69 per cent.\n\nDevendra Fadnavis \nThe stakes are high for Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, who led their respective parties from the front and were involved in a no-holds-barred campaign, relegating the Opposition Congress, the NCP and other players like the MNS and the AIMIM to the background.\nApart from Mumbai, the municipal corporations which went to the polls were Thane, Ulhasnagar, Nashik, Pune, Pimpri- Chinchwad, Solapur, Akola, Amravati and Nagpur.\nIn Mumbai, there were 2,275 candidates and 92 lakh voters.\n\nOfficials gear up for the election preparation, as they carry the AVM machines to poll centres in Mumbai on Monday.
