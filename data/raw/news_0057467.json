Sometimes they won’t stop asking their girlfriend if she’s upset , and other times they will just break out into a dance as if they are Michael Jackson in “Smooth Criminal .” And then sometimes, like in the case of 23-year-old woman Bryelle Marshall, you end up doing cartwheels in front of a cop during an DUI stop. \nThe incident kicked off last week when cops found Marshall passed out behind the wheel of her car in the driveway to a trailer park (fitting). Her car also happened to have an expired license plate. According to police, “Officers were able to wake her up when they started speaking to her.

According to The Albuquerque Journal , Marshall tried to kick an officer in the genitals after being taken to the Prison Transport Center. Marshall was of course charged with battery and aggravated DWI, as well as driving with an expired license plate. \nAnd yet, something tells me the cop wouldn’t have had as much patience if she didn’t look like this: Photo: Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:03:02.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
