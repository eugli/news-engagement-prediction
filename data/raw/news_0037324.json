Alexis [Sanchez], [Mesut] Ozil, [Olivier] Giroud and [Theo] Walcott. Up front they are a very dangerous team.’ Giroud? Most important? Really? (Getty) \nFew would disagree with the pick of Sanchez, however Ozil’s form has been dreadful, leading to speculation he could be dropped for tonight’s game. Meanwhile Giroud is unlikely to start.
