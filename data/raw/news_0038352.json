Later, he joined the military and pursued a career in aviation. \nHe spent 11 years in the military, including a six-month stint in Afghanistan in 2011. \n“When his country called on him… he was able to go to Afghanistan and represent so well. It was pretty special”. \nREAD MORE: Jeff Bird, Reynold Johnson identified as Mount Royal University pilots killed in plane crash near Calgary \nJeff married his wife Carly five years ago and the couple have two children. The youngest is only five-months-old. \n“I know she (Carly) was proud of his career,” David said. “Probably a bit worried at times but extremely proud. \n“They were just perfect for each other. As soon as my brother met her, you could just tell it was different and he spoke so highly of her.” \nHis brother said the reason he joined the MRU program is because he wanted to make sure he would be home to put his children to bed. \n“This Mount Royal position allowed him to still fly and keep his passion up but also be at home”. \nBird was on a routine flight on Monday when his plane lost contact. His family was still confident that he would survive. \n“It was just going to be, ‘Jeff does it again’ because he survived a tour and everything,” his brother explained. “It was just devastating that never happened.” \nBird was flying with Reynold Johnson, another instructor at MRU, when their plane crashed in a remote area northwest of Cochrane. \nThe Transportation Safety Board said it could be several months before any new information on the cause of the crash is released. \nJeff Bird’s family is holding a service for him on Sunday. \nJeff bird is pictured with his nephew.
