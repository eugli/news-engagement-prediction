The rayed crater seen on Dione (698 miles, or 1,123 kilometers across) is named Creusa. The rays are brighter material blasted out by the impact that formed the crater. Scientists can use the patterns of ejecta (like these rays), to help determine the order of geological events on a moon's surface by examining which features lie on top of other features.

North on Dione is up and rotated 31 degrees to the right. \nIt was obtained at a distance of approximately 350,000 miles (560,000 kilometers) from Dione. Image scale is 1.8 miles (3 kilometers) per pixel. \nThe Cassini mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (the European Space Agency) and the Italian Space Agency.
