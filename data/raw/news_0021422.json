I miss you. #TaraPalmerTomkinson #tpt #rip (sic)\" Santa paid tribute to Tara with this post (Photo: Twitter/@SantaMontefiore) \nIt comes after Santa gave fans an insight into what it was like growing up with Tara. \nShe was known for her outlandish behaviour and hedonistic lifestyle during her rise to fame, and her sister has revealed that her antics came as no surprise.
