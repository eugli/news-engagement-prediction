There is a band around stars where conditions are suitable for hosting liquid water. This is sometimes referred to as the “Goldilocks” zone: Not too hot, not too cold. \n“The seven wonders of TRAPPIST-1 are the first Earth-size planets that have been found orbiting this kind of star,” Gillon said in a release. “It is also the best target yet for studying the atmospheres of potentially habitable, Earth-size worlds.” \nThe dwarf star is named after The Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope (TRAPPIST) in Chile. \nTRAPPIST-1 is nothing like the sun. It is an ultra cool star, not because its hosts three habitable planets but because the temperature is a relatively cool -- 2550 Kelvin (K) compared to the sun’s blazing 5778 K. \nIt is also small, only 8% of the mass of the sun and about a tenth in radius. If the sun is a basketball, the TRAPPIST-1 would be the size of a golf ball. The lower temperature of the star means that planets close to it can host liquid water. \nThe seven planets uncovered in this system have been named from ‘b’ to ‘h’. \nAll planets that orbit around stars other than the sun are called exoplanets. Till now about two dozen planets have held out the promise of hosting life. \nThe latest discovery relies on observations from the Nasa’s Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared telescope that trails Earth as it orbits the sun. \nLast year, three planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system were spotted. With the help of ground-based telescopes, including the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope, Spitzer confirmed the existence of two of these planets and found five more. \nNow with the help of the Spitzer, Hubble, Kepler and Nasa’s James Webb Space Telescope, to be launched next year, astronomers hope to learn more about these planets. \nThey will help study the atmosphere of the planets, their temperatures and surface pressures, in search for clues about life. \nThe search for Earth 2.0 just heated up. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:27:41.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
