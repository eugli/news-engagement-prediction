Muslim engineer Yassmin Abdel-Magied repeatedly clashed with Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie on Q&A... affording the program a good week’s worth of headlines. (Pic: ABC/Q&A) \n“We believe this episode was in significant breach of the ABC values of ‘Respect, we treat our audiences and each other with consideration and dignity’, and ‘Integrity, We act with trustworthiness, honesty and fairness’, that your organisation prides itself on,” the petition reads . \nDignity? Oh please. It’s a TV show — and one very carefully designed to elicit heated debate, send Twitter into a meltdown and generate headlines the next day. \nNot, as Jerry Seinfeld might say, that there’s anything wrong with that. On the contrary, the team behind Q&A have done well to keep the show one of the most widely talked about programs on Australian screens for close to a decade. \nBut make no mistake, it doesn’t happen by accident. The producers know what they’re doing when they serve up fresh bait each week in the form of certain panellists bound to draw the ire of both the live audience and those playing along on social media at home. \nI know, because I have been one of them. And even though I found the audience to ultimately be very supportive and receptive during my two appearances on Q&A, it’s pretty clear that’s not how it was meant to play out. Don’t forget ABC’s Q&A is a carefully considered, highly produced television show designed to entertain its viewers. (Pic: Sam Mooy) \nPerhaps there was a bit of a clue when the warm-up guy made jokes about The Daily Telegraph to the crowd as I settled into my seat only moments before we went to air. (I’m going to hazard a guess no cheap shots about Islam were made as Abdel-Magied took to the stage — and rightfully not. That would be unfair and irresponsible, right?) \nPerhaps it was a sign I was considered to be trespassing on enemy territory when host Tony Jones directed an on-air quip at me at the expense of fellow columnist Andrew Bolt, seemingly for no other reason than to see if it might inflame the audience or even encourage them to boo. (To recap: they didn’t; I simply responded that “I will take that as a comment”; and to his credit Jones apologised a few minutes later). \nOr perhaps there was a hint that my assigned role for the evening would preferably be that of the villain when in the days leading up to the show I was inundated with messages on social media berating me for being “a baddie”. Sarrah Le Marquand responds to Tony Jones’ on-air quip at the expense of fellow columnist Andrew Bolt on the ABC’s Q&A in 2014. 31280 \nSarrah Le Marquand responds to Tony Jones’ on-air quip at the expense of fellow columnist Andrew Bolt on the ABC’s Q&A in 2014. 20 Feb 2017 \nMy sin? To work for News Corp and write a column for The Daily Telegraph. \nSo where are the petitions calling for the safe environment when a seemingly evil News Corp panellist or some other allegedly undesirable type is that night’s designated prey for the baying mob? \nBlatant hypocrisy notwithstanding, what exactly was it about the fiery exchange between Abdel-Magied and Lambie that prompted a handful of self-appointed moral guardians to seek to shut down debate. Was it that the two women — the horror! — dared to raise their voices? God/Allah forbid that anyone get too worked up when arguing over issues as complex as religion and human rights. \nSome of what both women say is objectionable — and some of what they say is valid — but they both have a right to be heard. \nAbdel-Magied is entitled to her view, Lambie to hers and we the audience are entitled to vehemently disagree or agree as we see fit. But we’re not entitled to start demanding those we happen to differ with be banned from participating. \nRather than attempting to silence the “wrong” kind of people from partaking in public discussions about important issues, we need to hear from a wide range of voices.

(Pic: News Corp) \nNot only superslick politicians who have mastered the easily-digested-by-the-likes-of Pedestrian TV sound bite, but politicians who hail from less urbane electorates and clumsily trip over their words in the face of Tony Jones’ barely concealed withering disapproval. \nWe need to hear from not only social media-sanctioned Muslims such as Yasmin Abdel-Magied, but also fearless yet polarising Muslims such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali. (Who, given her outspoken views on women’s rights and her calls for Islam to reform, is someone in need of genuine protection from actual death threats and not just from differing views inside the safety of a television studio). \nInstead of decreeing who shouldn’t be allowed on shows like Q&A, those serious about values such as respect and integrity should consider directing their petition-writing efforts towards lobbying for a public platform to be extended to everyone — not just the “right” kind of people. \nSarrah Le Marquand is the editor-in-chief of Stellar magazine and the founding editor of RendezView.
