Mario Matt dominated the slopes in Sochi – but will he go easy on Simon? Credit: Reuters/Alamy Stock Photo Simon Kelton , travel writer 27 February 2017 • 4:07pm \nG laring into the jaws of a serious mid-life crisis last January, I decided the best way to fight off stiff-jointed middle age was to learn to ski faster with Mario Matt. Matt is Austria’s two-time slalom World Champion and 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic gold medallist - in other words, a contender for being pretty much the best skier on the planet. \nMatt is a well-known celebrity in St Anton , which happened to be high on my hit list of ski resorts for a selfishly solo 50th birthday treat. Since his retirement in 2015, Matt has bought the infamous local bar the Krazy Kanguruh, which he now runs. The 10 best après-ski bars and clubs \nAll things considered, this sounded like the perfect opportunity to pull some journalistic strings and give myself the ultimate birthday present. \nAfter flying to Innsbruck, I was picked up by one of the Hotel Tannenhof’s gleaming new Audis and settled back into its luxurious leather seats to tuck into a hamper full of Tirolean delicacies for the hour-long drive to St Anton. \nRecognising that I had volunteered to share the slopes with the human equivalent of an Exocet missile on skis, I had decided to make this a truly five-star adventure – just in case it was my last.

Built in 1925, the hotel eventually became the throbbing heart of the area’s social elite in the Sixties before being completely rebuilt by its current owners Judith Volker and Axel Bach in 2011. \nThe result is what you might expect if your closest billionaire friend decided to create a fabulously luxurious and yet personal Alpine retreat. With just seven enormous suites – each with a bathroom that’s bigger than most family rooms in a traditional British chalet – and 24 members of staff available day or night, it takes the notion of pampering to a positively oligarchic level. Even the owners’ dogs are exceptionally friendly. \nAfter a decadent 11-course dinner created by James Baron, an English chef with a Michelin-starred pedigree, I dragged myself off to bed and hit the pillow feeling like a condemned man ready for the gallows. There are worse places to have a mid-life crisis Credit: © Hotel Tannenhof/ Markus Gmeiner \nFor my warm-up day, I didn’t just want to spend the day on skis, cruising between the linked villages of St Anton’s extensive Arlberg ski area . Instead, in a fit of overindulgent overconfidence, I had channelled my youth and booked a day’s heli-boarding with Harry Wolf, head of St Anton’s snowboard school and a former World Cup competitor. After a 15-minute drive out to a helipad between St Christoph and Zürs, we grabbed our gear and hustled over to a waiting Wucher chopper. \nAs we leapt skywards with a thundering rush of rotorblades, I felt courses three to eight of my sumptuous dinner rapidly sink into my boots, and wondered why anyone is ever dumb enough to leave their comfort zone behind. \nTouching down on the Mehlsack peak between Zürs and St Anton, I noted with alarm that the summit was graced with an enormous and somewhat foreboding iron cross. Luckily, a magnificent mountain panorama framed by cobalt skies and an ocean of velvet powder below us quickly quelled my panic.

My ecstatic whoops were only silenced by an unplanned crash into a series of bushes, which flipped me unceremoniously upside down into a ditch. The laughter, including my own, could be heard echoing around the peaks. \nWe continued down into a quiet, secluded valley of cross-country runs, where any humiliation was exorcised by a gastronomic venison lunch at the charming Älpele restaurant owned by Franz-Josef Walch. Rather than hike or cross-country ski back out to Lech , now the nearest resort, we persuaded the flamboyant manager to give us a high-speed ride clinging onto a waterski rope behind his snow-adapted quad bike, which took us back to the Tannenhof van, waiting for us just outside the village. \nSome would say warming up to ski with an Olympic slalom champion by going snowboarding off piste in deep powder was hardly the smartest idea. But any mounting anxiety about my upcoming lesson was postponed again by an intoxicating champagne reception, with an introduction to the Tannenhof’s spectacular 400-strong wine cellar by their expert sommelier Eva-Maria Walch.

After a night of alcohol-induced slumber, I fire myself up with a triple espresso and meet Mario with his friend Gunnar Munthe, the ex-owner of the Krazy Kanguruh, which he sold to Matt in 2015. \nAlthough he’s far more than just a local celebrity, Mario greets everyone with a polite, cheery humility that belies his awesome talent and success. Wearing just a dark grey jacket and loose blue ski pants, his appearance reveals nothing unusual. \nAs he starts to move, however, I instantly realise his muscles are working in a completely different way to those of any normal skier. Simply sliding through the lift pass barrier I find myself left several metres behind, and have to push frantically on my poles like a beginner to catch up. Clearly you don’t win 15 World Cup slaloms without quick feet. Gunnar Munthe and Mario Matt outside the Krazy Kanguruh, a St Anton institution \nBeing in the presence of an athlete so fit and strong has the mysterious effect of draining the last dregs of energy from my suddenly octogenarian-feeling body. As we step off our first lift, I am hit with an intense desire to lie down and weep. No wonder Mario won so many races if this is how his fellow competitors feel. \nWe set off for our first run, a relatively easy blue. I am on all-mountain skis , Mario is on short slalom skis. Despite the flat light, it’s clear his every turn is made with a combination of brutal yet balletic precision. \nAt the bottom Mario points out that most amateur skiers, Brits in particular, are lazy about preparing their edges. I am ashamed to admit that I only have mine serviced irregularly. Mario glares at me like a Ferrari mechanic dealing with a ditzy blonde. Visitors to St Anton ski hard by day and party hard by night \nOn our next run, a slightly steeper red, I can tell that Mario is still only in second gear – although the speed at which he gains ground from me is astonishing. Any hint of braking and I instantly lose metres. He wastes no effort in skidding, and remains constantly on two perfect rails like a Japanese magnetic train hurtling down a mountain road. \nSpilling out onto an easy blue section, we are finally able to focus on our carving. Mario explains how his weight transference moves down through his body into his big toe, then drives back through the foot into his heel to create such powerful turns. Skiing behind him and watching carefully, I begin to see what he means, and then finally to feel something approaching it myself. \nFinding this place is like having my old pistons bored out, releasing kinetic energy in the ski I didn’t know I had. The result is that I gain considerable speed – only to realise I might not have the strength to control it. \nThis quickly became another lesson. Pulling yourself back over the front of your skis to control speed requires a proportional amount of thigh strength. I find it relatively easy to do a couple of times, but it quickly becomes tiring. Of course, with extra strength comes better balance and, ironically, the better skier goes even faster with even less effort. A virtuous circle of power. Simon and Mario, the student and the maestro \nHaving gathered some useful tips and done my best to emulate some of the style of Mario the Master, I prepare myself to ski down first so that he can critique my method and style. \nIt sounded like such an inspired idea when I first thought of it, but now it feels like asking to sing “Nessun Dorma” in front of Pavarotti. \nFrantically trying to banish a mountain of negative thoughts, and a creeping sense of panic, I set off as fast as possible, making the most powerful turns I can until every muscle in my body is howling. I finally stop, convinced I must have looked like a spineless novice.

I turn around as he pulls up his goggles, pierces me with his electric blue eyes and jabs a muscular finger in my direction. I tremble, a talentless schoolboy about to be humiliated by a cruel, whip-bearing headmaster. \n“You…” I feel the bile rising. “You are a great skier.” I look at him bewildered, assuming the altitude has warped my hearing. And then it hits me – Mario Matt has cured my mid-life crisis. \nWhen the best skier in the world tells you you’re great, everything else in life is just gravy.
