The former eight-division champion announced on Twitter on Wednesday evening that he’s in talks for a bout with former champion Amir Khan. The two have been linked in the past and were former sparring partners when they both trained with Freddie Roach. Top Rank CEO Bob Arum told USA TODAY Sports the deal is contingent on securing $38 million from investors to stage the fight in the United Arab Emirates. Khan lives in England but his parents are from Pakistan. Pacquiao’s advisor, Michael Koncz, has taken the lead in talks with Team Khan. Koncz couldn’t be reached for comment. My team and I are in negotiations with Amir Khan for our next fight. Further announcement coming soon. #TeamPacquiao pic.twitter.com/nW5jpmwVJs \n— Manny Pacquiao (@mannypacquiao) February 23, 2017 “I don’t want to be saying this is going to happen, or not going to happen,” Arum told USA TODAY Sports during a phone call. “When the money comes up, then I’ll take a role in the promotion because I don’t know these (investors). “The money is very high, very considerable. I have no idea if they have the wherewithal to put this money up. Until they do I’m taking a hands-off approach. … Manny would be happy to do the fight if the money comes up. and I don’t have a lot of confidence that it will.” There’s a fallback plan if the funds don’t arrive: Horn. The bout was slated for April 22, but it’s unclear if it would still take place on that proposed date. It’s clear Khan is now the focus for Pacquiao (59-6-2, 38 KOs). And it’s a challenge Khan, a massive upgrade over Horn, has been screaming for. The 30-year-old is coming off a brutal knockout to Canelo Alvarez at 155 pounds, but a bout with Pacquiao at 147 figures to be highly compelling. Khan (31-4, 19 KOs) is one of the few fighters who can claim to be faster than Pacquiao, and they know each other well from the gym. The Filipino Senator reclaimed a welterweight title with a comprehensive decision over Jessie Vargas in November. He’s only available to fight during senate recesses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:10:56.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
