Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson has reportedly agreed to defend his title, while 2015 winner Stephen Curry is considering it. Curry has competed in the event for the past four years. \nCurry and Thompson put on their own 3-point exhibition Wednesday , combining for 17 3-pointers in an easy 1216-111 win over the Charlotte Hornets . They are the league's most prominent marksmen and will represent the Western Conference in the All-Star Game, so it would be a bit strange if they didn't take part in the 3-point contest together. \nAs for their competition, Portland Trail Blazers guard C.J. McCollum has confirmed he will participate . Dallas Mavericks swingman Wesley Matthews will also compete, and Cleveland Cavaliers sharpshooter Kyle Korver reportedly has been invited. \nThere will be eight shooters. Some ideas for those last spots: J.J. Redick, Kevin Durant , Seth Curry , Eric Gordon , Ryan Anderson Otto Porter , Kyle Lowry , Kyrie Irving , Kawhi Leonard , James Harden , Channing Frye , Nick Young and Joe Ingles . The full list of All-Star Saturday participants will be revealed Thursday on TNT starting at 7 p.m. ET.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T18:15:44.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
