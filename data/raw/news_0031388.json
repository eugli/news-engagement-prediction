Mayweather posted on Instagram shortly thereafter, sharing a similar sentiment. \n\"There seems to be several rumors floating around media recently however, let the record show, there hasn't been any deals made in regards to a fight between myself and any other fighters,\" he said. \"I am happily retired and enjoying life at this time. If any changes are to come, be sure that I will be the first to let the world know.\" \nA British tabloid wrote Tuesday that McGregor had traveled to the United States to film an anti-bullying public service announcement and was scheduled to agree to terms with Mayweather, cautioning that a third party was holding the bout up from being finalized. \nWhile there has been plenty of bluster from both Mayweather and McGregor about the fight, there's been no substantiated reports of actual negotiations to make it happen. For now, it will remain a talking point for both men and a dream match-up for fans. Whether it ever develops into anything more than that certainly remains to be seen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:35:33.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
