Follow @cnnsport \"I hope to see you next year,\" he had told the crowd at Rod Laver Arena at the trophy ceremony. \"If not, this was a wonderful run here and I can't be more happy to have won here tonight.\" Although he explained a day later he had no plans to retire just yet, the 11-month long men's tennis tour is one of the toughest and longest in professional sports and it remains to be seen how Federer's body will react as the season progresses.
