The Trump administration imposed sanctions on 13 people and a dozen companies in response to Iran’s recent ballistic missile test, increasing the pressure on Tehran without directly undercutting a landmark nuclear deal with the country. (AP) \nForeign airlines have instructed Iranian travel agencies not to sell US-bound flight tickets to Iranians holding US visas after President Donald Trump’s executive order banning visas for seven Muslim countries, including Iran. \nThe move comes even though a US judge on Friday temporarily blocked the ban, siding with two states that urged a nationwide hold on the executive order that has launched legal battles across the country. The directive does not include US airlines. \nIn Tehran, the Kowsar travel agency told The Associated Press they had been instructed by all foreign airlines not to sell tickets to Iranians with visas to enter the US. \nThe agency said there was no problem for those who have a permanent resident card or a US passport. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T15:55:18.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
