The service is made available throughout all major platforms, including Windows, Mac and mobile (iPhone / Android / Windows Mobile). Recently, a Windows 8 edition was issued and published in the Windows store for tablet users. Create an account and connect from various devices The desktop edition of Line was built for those who prefer the classical IM software approach, being able to communicate with friends and family from the comfort of their home. Highlights include a rich set of emoticons and stickers, file transfers, voice calls, group messaging and more. In order to gain access to the instant messenger, an account is required; subsequently, you can log in using a QR-based procedure that involves scanning a barcode generated by the desktop application with a mobile device, which will facilitate a successful authentication. Fun and easy to use LINE provides a user-friendly environment that allows for quick instant messaging sessions, with the possibility of saving the chats. The twist comes from the way conversations are displayed; each message is shown in a green bubble, very similar to iPhone and Android messages, which is innovative and fun. Another upside comes from the rich set of stickers that can be used to express various emotions. The list of emoticons is pretty generous, compared to other instant messengers, although it would have been a plus if some of them were animated. Start group chats with your friends Recent messages are preserved and kept in a separate section that offers instant access to any of the conversations. The chats can be carried out with a single member or with a group of friends and voice calls are also an option. Whenever you receive a new message, you are notified with a popup or with a sound (or both, you can adjust this from the Settings window). In addition, you can block users or hide friends from your list for complete privacy protection. A few last words In conclusion, LINE is an awesome choice if you’re looking for a messenger that’s friendly, easy to use and highly intuitive. It delivers a fun experience, no matter the platform you’re using, giving you the possibility to stay connected on the go. If your computer is running Windows 10 or 8.1, then you might want to consider giving the official LINE Window Store app a quick try. New in LINE 4.12.0.1362: We've made photos in chats easier to see. You can now like comments on Timeline posts. Animated emoji now play upon liking Timeline posts.
