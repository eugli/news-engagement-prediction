Mesut Ozil’s Arsenal career risks turning full circle ahead of Bayern Munich showdown opinion James Goldman for Metro.co.uk Wednesday 15 Feb 2017 8:51 am Arsene Wenger admitted Mesut Ozil was suffering from a lack of confidence after Saturday’s 2-0 win over Hull City. (Picture: Getty) \nHere we are again. A season on the verge of unraveling, confidence in short supply, a lack of stomach for the fight in evidence. In many ways Arsenal and Mesut Ozil are the perfect match. ‘How can Gibbs be captain?!’ Man Utd legend Roy Keane TEARS into Arsenal flops \nThe German’s Arsenal career reached its nadir nearly three years ago against Bayern Munich when he followed-up a costly first leg penalty miss with an anonymous display in the return, picked up a knee injury which would rule him out for five weeks and stood accused of ‘nicking a living’. \nIt would be a gross exaggeration to say Ozil’s form has been on an upward ascent ever since, there have been too many big game no shows and too few medals to argue otherwise. \nClearly, however, he has established himself as the main creative force in this latest intensely frustrating incarnation of Wenger’s Arsenal. Ozil was one of the few players to get the better of N’Golo Kante this season and was outstanding during September’s 3-0 win over Chelsea. (Picture: Paul Gilham/Getty Images) Ozil scored arguably the goal of this season’s Champions League so far with his late winner in the 3-2 victory over Ludogorets (Picture: Getty) \nAn assist-laden first half of last season looked destined to end with Arsenal as champions and Ozil crowned player of the year, while he began the current campaign with a fresh purpose, answered his manager’s call to be more ruthless and decorated the group stages of the Champions League with a goal against Ludogorets which summed up the levels of footballing perfection he, and only a handful of others, are capable of achieving. \nFor all the cut and thrust offered by Alexis Sanchez, the Arsenal engine rarely purrs unless Ozil is full command of the controls. \nCertainly, it is no coincidence the most damaging defeats of Arsenal’s campaign to date have coincided with the worst of Ozil. Blunted by Chelsea and Manchester City, invisible against Watford and guilty of a dereliction of duty against Everton, allowing Ashley Williams the freedom of Merseyside to power home a late headed winner. Ozil failed to challenge Ashley Williams, allowing the Everton defender to score the winning goal in December’s 2-1 defeat at Goodison Park.

(Picture: Regan/Getty Images) \nThe clamour for Ozil to be dropped is understandable, particularly given even his staunchest supporter in Wenger has hinted at a crisis of confidence. The likelihood of the Frenchman repeating Sir Alex Ferguson’s decision to axe Wayne Rooney from a Champions League heavyweight clash against Real Madrid remains remote, however. \nFerguson’s call was hailed as brave, ruthless and calculated. Ultimately, though, it failed to yield a victory as Real Madrid, with Ozil pulling the strings, raided Old Trafford and secured progress to the latter stages of the competition.

For all his faults, and there are many, it is hard to recount many seminal Manchester United victories in which Rooney failed to play a telling role. \nIconic recent Arsenal victories might have been few and far between but when they have arrived, Ozil has been pivotal. He tore Manchester United to pieces last season in Arsenal’s most convincing performance of that campaign and led N’Golo Kante a merry dance back in September as Arsenal battered Chelsea 3-0 at the Emirates. Ozil was outstanding, scoring and assisting, in last season’s 3-0 win over Manchester United. (Picture: Getty Images) Ozil scored in last season’s 2-0 win over Bayern Munich at the Emirates Stadium (Picture: Getty) \nAgainst tonight’s opposition, last season, starved of the ball Ozil somehow still managed to create six goalscoring opportunities and iced the cake with a late, game clinching goal in stoppage time. Nobody knows the value of an on song Ozil more than Wenger and he appears ready to stand by his man again. \n‘I have no doubt that we play in Germany and Ozil is highly focused to have a good performance,’ the Arsenal manager said at his pre-match press conference.
