Article continues below \nBut despite being one of the biggest clubs in the world in terms of revenue, United know they might find it difficult to cough up €100 million just one year after spending a similar amount on Paul Pogba. \nHaving the two most expensive players in world football - not to mention their astronomical wages - is enough to worry even United’s financial experts. Article continues below \nIf Griezmann receives a similar salary to Pogba - £15 million-per-year - United will be paying out £82,000 every day in wages to those players alone. \nTherefore, before Griezmann arrives, there simply has to be some departures to fund the deal. \nAnd, according to the Independent , there will be three players shown the exit door to help make space for Griezmann. \nThey are Wayne Rooney, Anthony Martial and Marouane Fellaini. \nRooney has been heavily linked with a move to China in the not too distant future with the 31-year-old currently struggling for first-team football. \nMartial was arguably United's best player last season but, like Rooney, he too is failing to make the starting line-up on a consistent basis. Reports suggest that the 21-year-old is not too happy with Mourinho's constant snubs. \nMeanwhile, Fellaini also finds himself as a bit-part figure at the club with Michael Carrick, Ander Herrera and Pogba all ahead of him in the pecking order. \nUnder Sir Alex Ferguson and his chief executive, David Gill, the Red Devils made sure that wages didn’t really go much above 50% if the club’s turnover. But, since they both departed, United have changed tact somewhat and have spent more than £500 million on transfers under three different managers. \nWith a lack of results, United simply cannot afford to keep spending these huge. \nThey will miss out on around £40 million if they fail to qualify for next season’s Champions League while kit manufacturers, Adidas, will also withhold £21 million. The fall in the value of the pound to the dollar since Brexit has seen United’s debt rise to £337 million. \nSo, while United may be one of the richest clubs in world football, even they need to balance the books from time to time and it seems Rooney, Martial and Fellaini will feel the full force of that. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
