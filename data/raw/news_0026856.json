CAMERON BURNELL/FAIRFAX NZ. \nWellington City Council recovery manager Mike Mendonca. \n\"Based on all the reports we have seen, while damage has been identified, we have not received any information that gives us concern about public safety. Some of damage found is minor, some of it more serious and will require repairs.\" \nREAD MORE: \nThe owners of 18 buildings on the list were given extensions to their Friday 5pm deadline for handing in engineering reports because of a lack of engineers. KEVIN STENT/FAIRFAX NZ. \nDamaged done to Statistics House on Wellington's waterfront by the November 2016 earthquake. \n\"We have had excellent co-operation from building owners, many of whom have been very proactive about being up front with us. In these cases, owners have asked for an extension for valid reasons and we have granted them,\" he said. \nIn the absence of risk to public safety, it was now a question for the building owner as to when and how they do repairs, and even in some cases if it might not be more economic to replace a building, he said. \nCouncil's involvement would be through our usual role of consenting building work. \nThe council's new powers under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act specifically precluded individual building reports being released by the council as only the building owner may choose to release that information. Ad Feedback \nThe list started with 80 buildings but was reduced to 72 because some buildings like Stats House and Revera House were seriously damaged, remained unoccupied and were having evaluations that were more rigorous than the assessment required. \nThere were also some buildings along the Terrace that had two addresses that were one building and as the council refined its criteria, a couple of buildings fell outside the targeted profile. \nThe IRD's 495 staff members were told to leave its Hawkestone St building last week after two floors of the 11-storey building required propping as a precautionary measure, after invasive testing. \n\"The owners of the IRD building decided to be proactive and get the repairs needed done as soon as possible. I encourage other building owners not to muck around, to get the work done as soon as possible, and to be proactive about it.\" \nMany tenants of buildings will want to know the details of their individual buildings. Those people should contact their building owners, he said. \nLester urged all building owners to do the right thing and be upfront with their tenants. \n\"I think that tenants have a right to know. Many of them are employers with specific duties they need to discharge under the Health and Safety Act. Please help them to discharge their duties by sharing the assessments.\" \nThe council's resilience officer Mike Mendonça said.. \nSince November, the council has been working closely with the Government on Wellington's resilience – looking at our buildings, unreinforced masonry, infrastructure and homes to make sure the city was as prepared as possible to respond to and recover from earthquakes. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:21:48.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
