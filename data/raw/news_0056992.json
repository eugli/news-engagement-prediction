GAME Digital \nPornhub has an official app, but it’s not available on the Play Store due to Google’s stance on pornographic content . \nThis means that users looking to download it must go down alternative, less familiar avenues, unofficial app stores that leave them more susceptible to opportunistic hackers. \n“Fake copies of legitimate antivirus programs used to be the domain of rogue AVs on Windows,” reads the ESET report. “Curiously, the malware, detected by ESET as Android/FakeAV.E also abuses another well-known brand: it spreads by pretending to be a mobile app for the adult video website Pornhub. How much porn stars really get paid \n“When the app is launched, instead of showing pornographic videos, it shows the user a message that says the device must first be ‘checked for viruses’. After clicking OK, the fake AV, which is made to look like Avast, runs its scam scan.” \nESET recommends users protect themselves by backing up their data and avoiding unofficial app stores altogether. \nThe firm's report also includes guidance for users who have already had their handsets infected by ransomware, with specific variants of malware requiring different techniques.
