Lisa B. Marshall, author of Smart Talk: The Public Speaker’s Guide to Success in Every Situation , told the New York Times that verbal fillers are like vulgarity: Occasional use is acceptable, but if the speaker leans on it too frequently, meaning is compromised and people assume the speaker is lazy. “Once you start into the pattern, it becomes a crutch,” she said. \nHow do you clean up your word choice and speak more effectively? You have to listen to yourself. Marshall recommends that people record themselves in real-world conversations and listen to the recordings for five minutes a day for two weeks. The repetition will drill the problem into your head and make you more conscious of it when communicating further.
