Up till now there has been no clue or lead, to the best of my knowledge, who his abductors are and where he may be. Even the whereabouts of the car that he was driving on that fateful day is unknown. \nI would, as a friend, fellow pastor and concerned Malaysian like to post five questions for our esteemed police force to answer. \n1. Was it true that the family’s initial attempt to make a missing person report was turned down due to the 24-hours ‘missing person’ rule even though at that material time, there was already evidence known to the police that he had been kidnapped? \n2. Why was there no official statement from the police regarding the abduction until very recently? \n3. As it happened in the daytime in a residential housing area with possibly many homes and even vehicles with closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras running, have the police contacted the respective house owners and made copies of the CCTV recordings, etc? If so, until now why no clear description of the black sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and Alphard involved in the abduction? \n4. With many of our main roads and highways being continuously monitored on CCTV, was any attempt made to identify the escape route of the vehicles involved in the kidnapping? \n5. What possible motive would anyone have to kidnap a pastor whose lifetime passion is to help the marginalised urban poor? \nI do feel our police force owe the family, the Malaysian church and the Malaysian public clear answers to the disappearance of one of our very own. \nIf things cannot be shared publicly, at least his immediate family should be privy to information for them to understand and know the progress, if any, about the investigation. \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:12:41.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
