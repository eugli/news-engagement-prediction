This could give Jubilee aspirant Suleiman A witi a chance to prevail against them.Another complicated case is in Garissa whereby Kalonzo has endorsed Farah Maalim whereas Raila is supporting Dola.The two are supposed to battle it out with Aden Duale.It will be better if NASA fielded a single candidate to run against Duale.By them standing divide they are giving Duale an easy time to be re-elected.When it comes to Kakamega the same party supremacy is being shown.Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya will have to face senator Boni Khalwale who is determined to become the next Kakamega governor.Oparanya is an ODM candidate whereas Khalwale is a member of Amani coalition.Going by the announcement made by Hassan Omar that they have agreed as Wiper to field candidates in all positions across the 47 counties has complicated the matter.
