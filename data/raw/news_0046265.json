MUST READ Hauz Khas rape case: Delhi Police nabs main accused, hunt on for others \nSurprisingly, his absence from his home over two days did not disturb her mother, who reportedly told the police, \"He would stay away from home for days on end.\" \nHe was nabbed once he returned home on the intervening night of February 20 and 21, police said. The victim's iPhone and almost Rs 500 were recovered from him. \nRaja was not employed at any restaurant and would earn his living by washing utensils at the restaurants and pubs located there that may have been short of staff. \nOn the night of February 18-19, when the woman was returning from a party in Hauz Khas village along with sister, the accused allegedly offered to drop her home. \nAccording to police, he apparently told her that his vehicle was parked at some distance near the park. The accused, thereafter, on the pretext of guiding the woman, led her to an isolated stretch in the adjoining park area and raped her twice before repeatedly slapping her. \nHe then fled from the spot by scaling the wall. The police said that Raja neither left for home not went to see a doctor to get his head injury treated. \nIt is to be noted that Raja was allegedly hit with a stone by the victim when he tried to make the first move in the park by touching her inappropriately. \nHe was arrested by the police in the same clothes in which he had committed the crime.   15:29 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:09:00.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
