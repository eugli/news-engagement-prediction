Randy Orton has won the Royal Rumble twice \nWyatt and Orton teamed up on Tuesday's edition of Smackdown to defeat Cena and Luke Harper, the latter now seemingly excommunicated from The Wyatt Family having attacked Wyatt and Orton during the Rumble Match. \nOrton pinned Cena after hitting his trademark RKO but The Cenation Leader will get a shot at revenge on next week's show when he goes one-on-one with The Viper in a non-title bout. John Cena was confronted by The Wyatt Family as he discussed winning his 16th world title at WWE Royal Rumble \nCena's Elimination Chamber rivals also came to blows, shortly after Styles had beaten Ambrose in the main event following The Lunatic Fringe's decision to take out Corbin and Miz at the commentary desk. \nMeanwhile, Naomi and a raft of tag teams learnt that they would receive title opportunities against Alexa Bliss and American Alpha respectively at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view in Arizona. Naomi (R) will battle Alexa Bliss at Elimination Chamber \nNaomi pinned Smackdown Women's Champion Bliss for the second time in three nights while teaming with Becky Lynch against The Wicked Witch of WWE and recent returnee Mickie James. \nAmerican Alpha issued an open challenge for their Smackdown Tag Team Titles, with The Usos, The Vaudevillains, Breezango, The Ascension , and Heath Slater and Rhyno all heading to the ring and engaging in a brawl . Will American Alpha retain their belt later this month? \nChad Gable and Jason Jordan will now defend their straps - which they won from The Wyatt Family on the final Smackdown of 2016 - against the five teams in a Tag Team Turmoil Match on Sunday week. \nElsewhere, Carmella downed Delilah Dawson after James Ellsworth tripped her opponent up, while Dolph Ziggler's attempts to rip off Kalisto's mask after defeating him were foiled by Apollo Crews. \nMissed WWE Smackdown?
