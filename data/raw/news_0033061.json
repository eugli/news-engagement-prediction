Former residents have won an Australia-first compensation payout. (Supplied) Hopes settlement will lead to closure \nMr Piper said lawyers for Henderson, the Commonwealth Government, the former NT Administrator, and Australian Indigenous Ministries (AIM) participated in the mediation. \n\"Of the 71 plaintiffs, around half alleged sexual abuse and virtually all alleged physical abuse while they were at, or under the control of, the missionaries of house parents running the home,\" Mr Piper said. \n\"We think it's the largest class action that there's been in the NT that's now settled and the terms of settlement are confidential.\" \nThe Federal Government was responsible for taking many of the mixed-race children from their families and putting them in the home as wards of the state. \n\"The Commonwealth acknowledges the trauma that has resulted from the abuse experienced by some of the children who resided in the Retta Dixon Home,\" a Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet spokesperson said. \n\"It is hoped that the settlement of this claim will enable those who suffered to reach a form of closure on this period of their lives ... all defendants contributed to the settlement.\" Survivors told of horrific abuse endured at the home \nThe institution housed scores of Aboriginal children from 1946 to 1980. \nThe royal commission in 2014 laid bare allegations of horrific sexual, physical and mental abuse at the home. \nA child at Retta Dixon who suffered seizures was allegedly tied up like a dog to a bed, and fed on the ground with an enamel plate. \nOne girl allegedly had faeces rubbed in her face, was tied to a clothesline and deliberately burned with hot water . \nResidents testified to seeing a male house parent force-feed a baby until she choked \nThe inquiry heard some children were raped so badly they were taken to hospital for treatment, but were watched by their abuser to make sure they did not alert authorities. \nOne man told of having to wear nappies to school as a boy to stop the bleeding after being sexually assaulted, while other children were allegedly flogged with a belt until they bled. \nOne woman said she had persistent hearing problems from beatings to her head. \nDuring the class action, the group told the court that staff at the home failed to report abuse or to listen to the children when they spoke up. \nMany complaints related to house parent Henderson, now aged 80. In 1984, he was found guilty of sexually abusing two boys at a public pool, but was never successfully prosecuted for criminal offences allegedly committed at the home. \nHowever, the royal commission heard there was evidence to support charges. \nMr Piper said the compensation payment is not expected for several months and he will be speaking to all 71 plaintiffs individually.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:19:20.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
