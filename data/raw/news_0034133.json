(JOSHUA ROBERTS/REUTERS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday, February 16, 2017, 7:27 PM \nSeveral White House staffers were removed from the administration Thursday morning after failing to go through FBI background checks, according to a report. \nSources familiar with the matter told Politico that six Trump employees were escorted from the White House by security because they failed to pass the SF86, a Questionnaire for National Security Positions used for security clearances. \nAmong those escorted was Caroline Wiles, President Trump's director of scheduling. She's also the daughter of Susan Wiles, Trump's Florida campaign manager and Gov. Rick Scott's (R-Fla.) ex-chief of staff. \nWiles will reportedly instead work for the Treasury Department, sources told Politico. \nCongress must probe Trump's denials on Russia \nThe reported dismissals came during a turbulent week for the Trump administration. \nEmbattled ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn was fired Monday night after he admitted he misled senior White House officials, including Vice President Pence, over conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. about sanctions imposed by the Obama administration. \nThen-Labor Secretary nominee, fast food CEO Andrew Puzder, withdrew Wednesday after allegations of spousal abuse cost him Republican support. \nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
