Bayern Munich received an offer of more than €100 million from Manchester United for Thomas Muller in 2015 but did not consider it, chief financial officer Jan-Christian Dreesen has told Sport Bild .\nDreesen confirmed that the huge bid for Germany international attacker Muller had arrived when his former Bayern coach Louis van Gaal was in charge at Old Trafford.\nHe said: \"Yes, that actually happened -- a fax arrived from England. But selling Thomas Muller was never a topic of discussion.\n\"When a player is right for us, we would be stupid to weaken our team for a short-term record profit.\"\nMuller, 27, went on to enjoy his most prolific season for the Bavarian giants in 2015-16, scoring 20 Bundesliga goals.\nBut although he has struggled for goals this season and ended a run of 999 minutes without one against Wolfsburg in December, president Uli Hoeness said : \"Manchester United wanted to pay €100 million for him a year ago. I'm not worried about Thomas.\"\nDreesen, who has been in charge of Bayern's finances since 2013, added that he was not concerned about the influx of Chinese money in the game.\n\"I think the people in China can also do their sums,\" he said. \"Over the course of time, everything will return to normality.\n\"There were horrendous prices at the start of every boom in economic history. And then they fall.\n\"That's exactly what will happen in China.\"\nMark Lovell covers Bayern Munich for ESPN FC.
