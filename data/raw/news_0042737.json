It felt incredible, in a happy way. It felt really emotional.’ Apps that tell you to walk 10,000 steps a day could be doing more harm than good \nAmazingly, Neil reckons his new-found hearing could have saved his life after stepping out of the way of an oncoming car after hearing it before he saw it. \nThe couple, who live near Salisbury, Wiltshire, were born deaf due to their mothers contracting rubella during pregnancy. \nDespite their audio impairment they have lived full and happy lives – they have raised a son and Neil is an Assistant Curate at Salisbury Cathedral. (Picture: SWNS) \nHelen, 54, tried for two years to persuade Neil to have an implant and he finally agreed after frustrating attempts at using hearing aids. \nThey first underwent surgery by Tim Mitchell, a consultant Ear, Nose and Throat surgeon at the Nuffield Health Wessex Hospital in Eastleigh, Hampshire. Donald Trump state visit 'should and will happen' MPs told during debate \nThe implant consists of two parts which sit on the inside and outside of the skull just above the ear and are joined by a magnet. \nInformation from the processor on the outside of the skull is sent to 16 electrodes on the inside, which then send electrical pulses to the brain.

(Picture: SWNS) \nCochlear implants were originally only thought to only benefit people who had recent lost their hearing and already had speech and language skills. \nBut Dr Mary Grasmeder said they are increasingly being used to treat people who have been deaf since birth. \n‘People who have been deaf for some time don’t have the same expectation of sound will be like compared with someone who has just lost their hearing,’ she said. \n‘Because their auditory system is not so well developed it will be more difficult for them to process the information and to understand it.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T13:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:38:22.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
