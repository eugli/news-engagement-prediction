Female politicians across the country, from all parties, are routinely on the receiving end of vitriolic — and often violent — comments on social media. So much so their staff must set up filters to screen out commonly used abuse — in the case of Ontario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, those include “slut,” “c***” and bitch.\n“Whether it happens on the street with a comment somebody makes to you, or whether it is a nasty tweet that someone targets you with, it is harassment,” said Women’s Minister Indira Naidoo-Harris. “It’s harassment, it’s bullying and it’s an attempt to really use scare tactics. The bottom line is that people are really trying to stop you from being a voice and ruin your credibility, and basically use fear tactics in order to silence you.”\nNaidoo-Harris likens the current climate to that of her childhood, growing up under apartheid in South Africa. “I understand very well what it’s like not to have a voice … this attempt to silence women and politicians today in the society that we live in reminds me of that.”\nLast year, Conservative MP Michelle Rempel went public about the sexism she’s faced in Parliament and online, and Alberta NDP Premier Rachel Notley is routinely threatened. During the U.S. election, crowds chanted “lock her up” at the mention of Hillary Clinton.\nHorwath said she watched with dismay the way Clinton was treated , “a woman with such credentials, with such capacity and such smarts … and how all of that was set aside in such a nasty way, in such an ugly way … by someone who’s trademark has been insulting people and treating people badly. It’s like it’s created a lot more room for these things to happen, with less criticism.”\nWhile women in power have always been a target, today’s social media attacks are “really intense and persistent and obviously highly gendered,” said Nancy Peckford of Equal Voice, a group that encourages more women to run for elected office. A few years ago, it launched a “Respect Her” social media campaign.\n“It didn’t explode all of a sudden,” she said of the online abuse, but it has gained traction as more women are elected and take on prominent roles. \nBack in the late 1990s, when Horwath was a Hamilton city councillor, she recalls being the target of sexist remarks, “but there was not a lot of head-on vitriolic hate and ugliness” like there is now. \n“It’s disappointing that this kind of ugliness has just found this place to thrive on Twitter and Facebook,” she said. “It’s almost like those platforms have provided a space where, for some reason, people don’t believe social norms and proper civility need to be observed, and that’s disturbing.”\nProgressive Conservative MPP Laurie Scott, who has had to call the police over some of the harassment she’s suffered, said after 17 years in public life, things have not changed for the better for women.\n“It’s actually worse — the violence against women, the normalcy of the threats and the treatment of women,” said Scott, her party’s women’s issues critic. “That’s a sad thing to say.”\nShe believes the proliferation of online pornography and violent video games have caused a cultural shift, “normalizing that it’s OK to be rude and threatening to women.”\nThe growing ugliness online has some worried about younger women being turned off politics. Even today, at best, most legislatures comprise roughly one-third females, some as low as 10 per cent. \nWynne recently told reporters she doesn’t want to stifle political debate, but believes “that most of that really negative attack is unacceptable to Ontarians. I don’t believe the level of civility that I encounter every single day in Ontario is reflected in those comments.”\nTory MPP Lisa MacLeod, who at one time was mocked for her weight and has received death threats online, has since become very strict about trolls. \n“Literally, the best thing I’ve ever done is hit the block button,” said MacLeod, adding her male colleagues aren’t targeted in the same way unless they are really outspoken on a controversial issue. “I enjoy social media; I enjoy the back and forth but I’m not putting up with people berating me … I deserve a safe space on the Internet just like everybody else.”\nPC Leader Patrick Brown, who considers social media “the Wild West,” said “anyone in public service should immediately denounce any examples of this when we see it arise. Not ignore it, not sweep it under the carpet — there’s no place for it.”\nThe issue, however unpleasant, has started a conversation Peckford doesn’t think would have happened even five years ago. A recent study found that 42 per cent of female politicians reported being denigrated on social media — but 80 per cent would not be deterred by it.\nSylvia Bashevkin, a professor at the University of Toronto who has studied women in politics, said what’s happening “is a wake-up call that the problems” experienced by female politicians over the past 100 years “are very much alive.”\nShe is, however, heartened by actions like the women’s marches in January, a mobilization that “could help to counterbalance trends.”\nOntario MPPs say while the online abuse takes a toll, they don’t let it silence them. \n“In fact, it emboldens me,” added Scott. “But it shouldn’t happen.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:14:26.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
