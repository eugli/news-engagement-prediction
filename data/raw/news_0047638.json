At about 2:30 p.m, Mimiko mounted the podium and announced the postponement. \nHe explained that Osinbajo had actually been airborne and he had to return to Abuja due to bad weather. \nAccording to Mimiko, Osinbajo further waited at Abuja Airport between 10 a.m and 2 p.m for the clouds to clear. \nThe governor described the gesture of the acting president as an act of humility for someone in a very high position. Osinbajo \n“He is the vice president and acting president for now, and we can all imagine how tight his schedule will be. \n“Therefore, on behalf of your government, I apologise and give you greetings from him. \n“He is very touched that he kept people waiting for so long due to no fault of his, but he said it would be unthinkable for him not to find time and come. \n“He has, therefore, asked me to postpone the inauguration of this project till 1p.m on Monday,” Mimiko said. \nSpeaking on behalf of Osinbajo, Mrs Janet Olisa, his Chief Protocol Officer, also apologised on behalf of her principal. \nShe said the visit would serve a double purpose; a fact-finding mission on issues in the Niger Delta, and to also honour Governor Mimiko for a job well done. \nTo assure people of the state that Osinbajo would be on ground on Monday for the inauguration, Olisa said that her team would remain in Akure till Monday.
