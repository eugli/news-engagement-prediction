Photo: Chris Hyde \nNev said they had feared the worst and spent part of the day out on foot looking for their missing son, who was said to be checking into a health facility but didn't want contact with his family. \n\"I'd say we were ready for the worst. Pretty tough. I'd hate it to get any worse because my wife is a wreck, as expected. We'll get through. We've been through tough times before,\" Nev said. \nConcerns were raised early on Thursday morning after Hackett posted an image of himself to Instagram, lashing out at his brother Craig. \n\"My brother comments to the media ... but does anyone know he beat the shit out of me,\" he wrote. \n\"Everyone knows he is an angry man.\" \nNev Hackett told media on Thursday afternoon there was much more to the story of his son's facial injuries than had been let on to the public. Early on Thursday, Hackett posted an instagram image of a black eye and suggested his brother Craig had assaulted him at some stage. \n\"There's that story about Craig but there's much more to that story than what appeared on Facebook (Instagram) this morning. Much more. But our barrister has told us not to comment, so we won't.\" \nMedia had been camped outside of the residence for much of the day as news of Hackett's disappearance became public. \nHis father looked relieved to be able to deliver welcome good news as Hackett continued to try to tame the issues that led to his arrest then release on Wednesday. \nThe Olympian was arrested after a disturbance at his parents' Mermaid Waters home, where he allegedly became agitated and verbally aggressive. \nHe was later released without charge. \nBrother Craig spoke to reporters outside the family home on Wednesday, saying the family didn't know how to deal with his erratic behaviour. \n\"The whole family have done everything that we can but now it's kind of out of our hands, it really is,\" Craig said outside their home. \n\"This is not Grant Hackett. This is a completely different person. I don't know this person; my mum and dad don't know this person,\" he said. \n\"He's there in body but he's not there in mind, soul or spirit. \n\"From a mental health perspective, I hope something can be done.\" \nPeople who need support can contact Lifeline on 13 14 11.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T09:56:25.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
