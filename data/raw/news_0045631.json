And although it’s pretty surprising, we’re definitely not mad. Less than a week after Selena Gomez and Kygo dropped their new track “It Ain’t Me,” The Fast and the Furious star was featured on a new rendition of the break-up-themed cut. Vin teased the collaboration Saturday, thanking Norwegian producer Kygo for giving him the chance to showcase his vocal chops. \nYou are going to be as shocked as I am... Kygo the magician just took my voice and added it to his new track. Speechless. — Vin Diesel (@vindiesel) February 17, 2017 \nGo to my Facebook page... wait for it... again thank you Kygo for making magic. Selena's voice is beautiful and welcoming. Dream come true!! — Vin Diesel (@vindiesel) February 18, 2017 The updated version features Gomez and Vin signing in a duet style, resulting in an interesting contrast between their distinct voices.
