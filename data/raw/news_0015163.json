TNN | Updated: Feb 6, 2017, 08.13 AM IST Primary health centre of Bankli, Pali JAIPUR: Community participation has helped the primary health centre (PHC) of Bankli village in Pali to emerge as one of the best nine PHCs in the state. Under Centre's Kayakalp project, the state has identified nine PHCs, which secured first prize. Bankli's PHC was one of them. \"The credit goes to the people of the village. They have spent Rs 1 crore through contribution. They collected around Rs 1 crore and spent it on the development of the PHC,\" Dr Surendra Singh Shekhawat , chief medical health officer (Pali) said. He said that one person donated Rs 50 lakh for the renovation of the PHC. \"One Suresh Kumar Jain, who is a resident of the area, is a businessman in Mumbai. He gave Rs 50 lakh for renovation of PHC,\" Dr Shekhawat said. The PHC in Bankli of Sumerpur block was in a bad shape two years ago. The roof leaked, the doors were old and rotting, flooring was uneven, the medical equipment too was not up to the mark. But, now in two years, the renovation has not only given it a beautiful look but also helped the PHC pass the parameters of Kayakalp programme. Now, the flooring in the PHC matches that of any private hospital of a city. Encouragement from the health department officials influenced the people of the area to contribute for the renovation of PHC. Now, it also has a labour table, which costs Rs 25,000.
