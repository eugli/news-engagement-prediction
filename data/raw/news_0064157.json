Yes, this iconic film and the first three Jaws movies are leaving Netflix in March 2017. Why? Because life is hard and we can't have nice things. Just kidding. It probably has something to do with streaming rights, but that doesn't make this news any less devastating. You better plan that Jaws -themed party before March 1 or you'll be in for a world of (non-shark-related) pain. \nAnd the Jaws franchise isn't the only thing abandoning us next month.

Obviously, this means you need to cancel your wild Saint Patrick's Day plans (read: eating pizza outside) so you can marathon accordingly (read: eat pizza inside).
