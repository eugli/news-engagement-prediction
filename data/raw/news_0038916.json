Robbie Drake with the Chilliwack RCMP says the rocks fell on to Highway 1, about 25 kilometres north of Hope, B.C., Tuesday evening.\nShe says the road is blocked, but no vehicles were hit in the slide and no injuries have been reported.\nDrake says the slide was quite significant, stranding several vehicles on the south side of the blockage, including a Greyhound bus, and stopping train traffic in the area.\nCrews were trying to get the vehicles turned around and off of the highway Tuesday night before a large amount of rain forecast for the area began to fall.\nDriveBC says there's no estimate yet on when the road will re-open, but an assessment will take place Wednesday morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T18:39:16.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
