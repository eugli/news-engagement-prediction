Some shouting ensued, and hotel staff intervened. Shortly thereafter, Spencer left.” \nIn characteristic libertarian fashion, Soave pointed out that “the Marriott Wardman hotel is private property, and should enjoy the absolute right to evict irksome and unwelcome guests from its premises.” \nSpencer has naturally availed himself of the opportunity to troll libertarians on his Twitter account. Some of his tweets are included below, although for spatial reasons we have not included all of them. When you accept the reality of race it's hard to be a libertarian. Liberty isn't consistent with equality. Grow up and pick one. #ISFLC17 \n— Richard 🥛 Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 19, 2017 You can't be pro-science libertarians if you don't understand human evolution gave us races. #ISFLC17 \n— Richard 🥛 Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 19, 2017 On the biggest issue of our times — immigration & White replacement — libertarianism has failed us. #ISFLC17 \n— Richard 🥛 Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 19, 2017 \nhttps://twitter.com/RichardBSpencer/status/833144529238646784 The thing that scares the libertarians is that we were once them but wound up #altright . #ISFLC17 \n— Richard 🥛 Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 19, 2017 White millennials voted for Trump & support Le Pen. Libertarianism is over because it ignores white replacement. #ISFLC17 \n— Richard 🥛 Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 19, 2017 You can have your well fed right & it's boring conferences, Jeffrey Tucker. I'll red pill a generation just by showing up. #ISFLC17 \n— Richard 🥛 Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 19, 2017 Why does Jeffrey Tucker support deporting me from #ISFLC17 & not illegal immigrants or violent Muslims from America? \n— Richard 🥛 Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 19, 2017 \n“Attempts to disrupt the conference, both from the far left and far right, were not entirely unexpected, but the appearance of Mr. Spencer and alt-right activists at the hotel demonstrated the alt-right’s hostility to the ideas of liberty and freedom,” said Students for Liberty CEO Wolf von Laer in a statement . “Although we support freedom of speech and thought, we did not invite Mr. Spencer. We reject his hateful message and we wholeheartedly oppose his obsolete ideology.” \nMatthew Rozsa is a breaking news writer for Salon.
