PUBLISHED: 00:01, Mon, Feb 6, 2017 | UPDATED: 08:10, Mon, Feb 6, 2017 GETTY Portrait of Elizabeth II has been reissued to mark the 65th anniversary of the day she became Queen \nThe photograph shows the head of state wearing a suite of sapphire jewellery given to her by King George VI as a wedding gift in November 1947. \nSapphire is the 65th anniversary gemstone and the King’s gift to his eldest daughter, then Princess Elizabeth, featured a glittering necklace, dating from 1850 and made of 16 large oblong sapphires surrounded by diamonds, with a pair of matching sapphire and diamond drop earrings. \nThe Queen has added a sapphire and diamond tiara – made from a necklace that originally belonged to Princess Louise of Belgium – and a bracelet 1963 to the collection to complement the original pieces. She had the necklace shortened and the largest stone made into a pendant. GETTY The photo shows Her Majesty wearing a suite of sapphire jewellery given to her by King George VI \nThe photograph was taken and first issued in 2014 after being commissioned for the government’s “Great” campaign, which aims to promote the UK abroad. \nMr Bailey took a number of portraits of the monarch, and when the Duke of Cambridge saw them during a visit to a “Great” event in Shanghai the following year, he said: “I love them”. \nThe photographer, whose famous sitters include the Kray twins, Diana, Princess of Wales and the Beatles, said at the time of the commission: “I’ve always been a huge fan of the Queen. She has very kind eyes with a mischievous glint. I’ve always liked strong women, and she is a very strong woman.” \nToday, The Sapphire Jubilee anniversary will be a sombre affair with the Queen remaining indoors and thinking about her late father. \nRoyal gun salutes will fire in London to commemorate the 65th anniversary of the monarch's accession to the throne. \nThe King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery will stage a 41-gun salute in Green Park, followed by music from Band of the Royal Artillery.
