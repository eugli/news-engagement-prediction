Seven Earth-sized worlds have been found orbiting a single star 39 light-years away. And these new worlds could hold life.\nThe red dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, which sits in the constellation of Aquarius and barely the size of Jupiter, was thought a year ago to have three planets in orbit around it.\nThis initial discovery caused scientists to keep a close eye on the star. But now a study published in the science journal Nature has exposed a wealth of worlds which are generally thought of as being rare.\nNASA has just made the incredible announcement : Seven Earth-sized exoplanets around the one star. All are thought to be mostly made up of rock and could potentially support liquid water on their surfaces.\nThree are close to the star, and may be a little too hot to hold much liquid water.\nOne - the seventh - may be an ice world.\nBut three of them fall comfortably in the “habitable zone” - orbits neither too hot nor too cold.\nThat means they may have strong potential to sustain life as we know it.\nNew record!

Scientists made the discovery using the Spitzer space telescope.\nFollowing the announcement, NASA tweeted : “Finding life elsewhere is one of three overarching goals for @NASA science.

RED DWARF WORLDS\nTRAPPIST-1 is a small red dwarf star — barely bigger than the planet Jupiter — on the cooler end of the spectrum. But red dwarfs are the most common type of star in our galaxy.\nUp to 50 per cent of the Milky Way is made up of red dwarfs.\nThat there are seven potentially habitable worlds in orbit around just one of these has enormous implications for the odds of there being alien life.\nAnd any such life is likely to be very odd, given the alien environment.\nSPECIAL FEATURE: On red dwarf worlds, it’s life - but not as we know it\nRed Dwarf Worlds by Steve Grice on Sketchfab\nSPECIAL FEATURE: Different. Deadly. Alien. Life on red dwarf worlds\nBut co-author Amaury Triaud from the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, UK, says it is very hard to know if such an abundance of Earth-like planets is common.\nAs for hosting life, there are complications.\nProfessor Gillon and colleagues emphasise that further observations are required to thoroughly detail the nature of these planets — especially the seventh. This outermost planet has not yet had its orbital period defined.\nGiven TRAPPIST-1 is just 39 light years away, this opens up the opportunity for much more detailed observation of the planets as a new generation of telescopes come online, including the Hubble-replacement space-based telescope, the James Webb Telescope next year.\nAnother specialist planet-hunter will also be launched in 2018, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite .\nmedia_camera An extrapolation of the TRAPPIST-1 red dwarf planets compared to the rocky worlds in our own Solar System. Picture: NASA THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION\nWith seven worlds all orbiting so close to one another, they may be ‘pulling’ on each other in unusual ways.\n“It’s a very small, very compact system,” says ays Emmanual Jehin, a co-author on the study. “The seven planets are all included well inside the orbit of Mercury.”\nSuch gravitaitonal ‘squeezing’ could heat up the planets’ cores.\nThis is significant.\nIt could do to the seventh ice world what is happening with moons like Europa and Enceladus: melt water under its ice surface. Again, this brings with it the potential for life.\nIt could also contribute towards giving the worlds a magnetic field - a protective shield against the red dwarf’s solar flares.\n“This star is extremely quiet compared to other very small stars. It’s very calm compared to Proxima Centauri, for example,” Jehin says. “If we’re optimistic, at least five of the planets—maybe not the first and maybe not the last—but at least five could have some liquid water on the surface, if they have atmospheres and the right pressures.”\nRed dwarf worlds", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9d47fa4832c4492c30f4907c7ffa41b1?width=650", "https://twitter.com/NASA?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "http://www.trappist.one/#", "https://t.co/1gzCf0x21u", "https://t.co/iav8Z6jMUY", "https://twitter.com/POTUS131/status/834470651519971328", "https://jwst.nasa.gov/", "https://twitter.com/NASA/status/834466377201307652", "https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive", "http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/special-features/in-depth/red-dwarf-star-life-but-not-as-we-know-it/news-story/cc9a82b90f9d1d7003267b49482d6379", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dde95ffe825e78869c036f646f9fa432?width=650", "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v533/n7602/full/nature17448.html", "https://t.co/fWRsY1HCto", "https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/", "https://t.co/yniGxLWV4t", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e9a47e1a6015ea5baa6db1492cf0e4e6?width=650", "https://t.co/GgBy5QOTpK", "http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature21360", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b1967fc80fd9216530b48be3da1a8834?width=650", "https://t.co/NEavRSXDU2", "https://sketchfab.com/models/647d7b74f4564ebfa6c714b78ef26f3d/embed", "https://twitter.com/NASA", "https://sketchfab.com/models/647d7b74f4564ebfa6c714b78ef26f3d?utm_medium=embed&utm_source=website&utm_campain=share-popup", "https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/834470207921991682", "https://t.co/C2JWjDfBdK", "https://twitter.com/BBCBreaking/status/834468147272953856", "https://t.co/zQ2kyfSz83", "https://twitter.com/NASA/status/834479166565318657", "https://sketchfab.com/seidelj?utm_medium=embed&utm_source=website&utm_campain=share-popup", "https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/834464945496608768", "https://t.co/IiDr777SmJ"], "published": "2017-02-22T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:08:38.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
