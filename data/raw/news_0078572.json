He is known for moving beyond the often-seen trap genre and instead combining 90’s Southern hip-hop with a more modern sound. \nThe Super Collaboration project is a major production between Korea and the United States. BewhY, who won the Mnet survival program “Show Me the Money 5,” was recommended to Big K.R.I.T and MNC Records (a publisher and agency in various countries such as the United States, Japan, and China) by their partner company, Sky Infinity Group. \nBewhY has also previously named Big K.R.I.T as one of his role models. Through MNC Records, he released a statement saying, “It was an honor and a dream to be able to work with an artist that I’d admired since I started rapping. I had more fun than I’ve ever had working on the project and will work hard to make the finished product even better.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:42:14.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
