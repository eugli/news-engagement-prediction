He’d also won two Lombardi Trophies with the New York Giants (Super Bowl XXI, XXV) as the team’s defensive coordinator. \nBelichick’s previous boat, “VI Rings,” was donated to Sail Newport, a non-profit educational organization. The boat had previously been named “V Rings,” but was in need of some updating following the Patriots’ Super Bowl XLIX win over the Seattle Seahawks. \nWe have a feeling Belichick is hoping to rename his new boat to “VIII Rings” at the conclusion of next season. \nThumbnail photo via Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:41:36.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
