But Cuban's not really sure why. \nFresh off a state visit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump got his Sunday morning off on the right foot by calling Cuban dumb. I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls.He's not smart enough to run for president! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017 \nCuban responded succinctly: — Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 12, 2017 \nCuban, an entrepreneur who currently owns the Dallas Mavericks and appears on the TV show \"Shark Tank,\" followed up by sharing a screenshot of a pair of emails -- one purportedly from Trump, the other Cuban's own response: \nCuban eventually came out in support of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. \nIt's not immediately clear why the president chose to go after Cuban today. When asked by a Twitter user, Cuban didn't have an answer. But he did have a comeback. I don't know. But isn't it better for all of us that he is tweeting rather than trying to govern ? https://t.co/953MuEdfeu — Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 12, 2017 \nThis is far from the first time Trump has tweeted about Cuban -- usually negatively. Since 2013, Trump has tweeted at least 20 times about the basketball team owner. Trump has called Cuban a \"loser,\" a \"jerk,\" and in his most recent tweet prior to today's, \"dopey.\" \nAllison Carter is Facebook editor at IndyStar.
