College basketball: Louisville is a serious Final Four contender Mark Wiedmer | Chattanooga Times Free Press Last Updated - Feb 21, 2017 13:50 EST Contact | Archive | RSS \nRick Pitino didn't become the only college basketball coach in NCAA history to win national championships at two different schools (Louisville and Kentucky) without knowing how to motivate his players after both victory and defeat. \nSo while the Hall of Fame coach may not have taken kindly to U of L giving up 90 points in this past Saturday's 94-90 home victory over pesky Virginia Tech, it's doubtful he believed a word of his comment that \"if we don't start playing better defense, we're all going to be on vacation early.\" Jamie Rhodes | USA TODAY Sports Images Louisville Cardinals guard Donovan Mitchell (45) has been a key cog for the Cardinals offensively this season. Especially since counterpart Buzz Williams said of those 17 3-pointers the Hokies tossed in from all over the Yum! Center: \"If we don't have a hot shooting night, they beat us by 40.\"\nNonetheless, Louisville is back with a vengeance this winter as it prepares for a pivotal Atlantic Coast Conference game Wednesday night at conference leader North Carolina. \nNow 22-5 for the season (10-4 in the ACC), the Cards are up to No. 7 in the latest Associated Press poll and No. 4 in Monday's NCAA Rating Percentage Index. \nRELATED : AP Top 25 | Behind the Numbers of the AP Top 25 \n\"I think Louisville can and potentially will win the league,\" Virginia Tech's Williams said over the weekend. \"I think Louisville is a one seed, no worse than a two seed [in the NCAA tourney]. This is one of the best teams in the country. Coach Pitino has been in the Hall of Fame and deservedly so. He's ahead in every way.\" \nTypically, the Cards are ahead of everyone they play defensively, famously playing Pitino's \"mother-in-law\" defense, which he once said was labeled that because it brought constant harassment. \nAnd last Saturday's 90 points aside — U of L hasn't surrendered more than 80 in any other game this season — the Cards still remain second in the formidable ACC in scoring defense (64 points allowed per game), 3-point defense, blocks and rebound margin. \nAs U of L point guard Quentin Snider surmised after the Virginia Tech game: \"Most important thing with Coach P is defense. And today the defense wasn't that good.\" \nWhat's beginning to seem much different about these Cards from some of Ricky P's predecessors is their offensive chops. \nIf you throw out a 71-55 loss at Virginia on Feb. 6 when the Cards were without four starters due to injury and suspension, they have averaged 85.3 points per game since Jan. 19. Their points-allowed average in those same eight ACC games was 67.4. \n\"Coach has put so much emphasis on moving the ball,\" leading scorer Donovan Mitchell (15.6 ppg) said earlier this month. \"It's all about finding the open man.\" \nLong Beach State coach Dan Monson has brought his 49ers teams to Louisville three times. After an 88-56 loss to the Cardinals earlier this season he said, \"This is the best offensive team they've had. They just have a lot of ways to score. Some years they have been more of a grind-it-out team, but I'm really impressed with their balance.\" The Jayhawks enter this week leading the RPI: https://t.co/jqCslwiSJW 1.
