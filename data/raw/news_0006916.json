We know what it’s like to be bullied or trolled.” \nThe video also features advice from the athletes. \n“Surround yourself with positive people,” said Patrick, the NASCAR star. \n“I know if somebody’s going to say something mean or negative I just don’t give them the time of day,” said Phelps, a 23-time Olympic gold medalist. \nAD METER: Vote for the Super Bowl's best commercial \nMessler said the campaign was not planned to coincide with Trump’s executive order barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. \n“This is actually something that we’ve been working on for a while,” she said. “It happens to be an interesting time in regards to the last several weeks, but we were working on this back in 2016.” \nThe campaign, presented in conjunction with American Family Insurance, will roll out additional videos over the next several weeks featuring other athletes, including Andrew McCutchen, Alex Smith and Abby Wambach. \nMORE SUPER BOWL ADS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T10:38:34.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
