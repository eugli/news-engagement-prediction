Head Back to School with the Best Movies About Teachers By Beth Accomando Updated July 03, 2016 . \nAn inspirational teacher can make a difference to a student by providing guidance and support at a crucial moment in a young person's life. The classroom – with all its inherent drama, conflict, and diversity – has provided the perfect setting for many movies. Whether it's the passion of a young, idealistic teacher or the wisdom of a seasoned vet, these films remind us how important an educator can be in forming young minds. Here are the best teachers you can find in the movies. © Columbia Pictures Buy from Amazon \nSidney Poitier is the quintessential inspirational teacher. He plays an idealistic engineer-turned-teacher who ends up in an East End London school where the staff has given up on the rowdy, incorrigible students. Things start rough, but once he throws out the textbooks and decides to teach the kids about life rather than square roots and split infinitives, he begins to win their trust and respect. The film deals with discrimination based on both race and economics, and Poitier is perfect as the man the kids come to refer to as \"Sir.\" Judy Geeson and Lulu were reunited with Poitier in the 1996 TV sequel directed by Peter Bogdanovich .

Barrett is a rookie teacher who has to put the theories she learned getting her degree into practice at the racially mixed Calvin Coolidge High School. Barrett's triumph is not only in reaching many of the students but also in being able to maintain her compassion and dedication in the face of overwhelming obstacles. She had to contend not only with tough teens that didn’t trust her but also an administration that didn’t place much value on her students. The film was shot at a real New York City School.

The school is racially diverse but not well integrated, with students sticking to their own ethnic groups. Gruwell proves to be naïve and out of her element yet her dedication to finding a way to reach these troubled kids is truly inspirational and moving. In real life, a number of Gruwell's students have themselves turned to teaching because of her.
