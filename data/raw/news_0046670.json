Victoria’s police minister has confirmed there were five people on board the plane. \nVictoria police superintendent Mick Frewan said at a press conference that police had not been able to confirm any fatalities and did not know how many people may have been in the shopping centre when the crash occurred.

It went just behind the barriers so I couldn’t see the impact but when it hit the building there was a massive fireball,” he told ABC 774. \n“I could feel the heat through the window of the taxi, and then a wheel, it looked like a plane wheel, bounced on the road and hit the front of the taxi as we were driving along. We kept driving and there was big fireball behind us.” \nThe shopping centre is on the edge of Essendon airport. It is understood the plane crashed into stores on the edge of the shopping centre, which does not open to the public until 10am. \nA woman who dropped her daughter off at the Spotlight store on Tuesday morning told Fairfax Radio her daughter confirmed the plane had crashed into that store and it was on fire, but that all staff were unharmed. \nThe plane was reportedly a five-person Beechcraft charter plane on its way to King Island. \nAmbulance Victoria said earlier reports that it was an air ambulance were incorrect. \nVictorian premier Daniel Andrews skipped a caucus meeting on Tuesday morning to be briefed on the crash. \nThe opposition leader, Bill Shorten, tweeted his condolences. \nDebris from the crash was found up to 100m away, Seven News reported.
