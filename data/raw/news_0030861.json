We can’t let it go as green,” a bench headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar told attorney general Mukul Rohatgi, who had told the court that a speaker’s decision cannot be challenged in court. \nRohatgi was opposing Congress Rajya Sabha member Jairam Ramesh’s petition in which he challenged the speaker’s decision to certify the bill on Aadhaar as money bill. \nRamesh contended that the certification was done to avoid the bill’s scrutiny before the Rajya Sabha, which does not have a say on a money bill.

The original bill, he said, was never pitched as a money bill, while the amended one was. \nRohatgi countered Chidambaram and said the legislation covered all mandatory requirements under the Constitution to be certified as a money bill as all expenditure on social welfare programmes connected with Aadhaar would be withdrawn from the consolidated fund. \nThe bench appeared to agree with Rohatgi and asked Chidambaram to look into all the objections the AG raised.

But you can convince us during the next hearing,” the bench told Chidambaram, giving him four weeks to respond. \nThe Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial & Other Subsidies, Benefits & Services) Bill, 2016 was discussed and passed in the Lok Sabha on March 11 last year. It was then taken up in the Rajya Sabha on March 16, where several amendments were made to it. The bill was then returned the same evening to the Lok Sabha which rejected all amendments proposed by the Upper House and passed it. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:23.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
