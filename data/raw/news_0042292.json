Chelsea Schneider 6:04 a.m. ET Feb. 20, 2017 Indiana Statehouse (Photo: file photo) 160 CONNECT 6 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPrivate schools that receive state funding through Indiana’s voucher program could see reprieves from consequences tied to low A-F accountability ratings under a proposal being considered by a House panel. \nThe plan that could ease accountability standards on “D” and “F” voucher schools was added into an education bill last week. \nUnder the proposal, low-performing voucher schools could now request the Indiana State Board of Education to waive or delay certain consequences for a year. \nThe state board could approve the request if a majority of students in a school have shown academic improvement. Under state law, voucher schools receiving either a “D” or “F” for two consecutive years, can’t receive new voucher students for a year but current students can still receive the aid. If the school continues to receive a low rating for a third year, then it must improve its scores for two years to accept new students. \n“Unfortunately, vouchers, which were held to a higher level of accountability which I believe is appropriate, have no redress in terms of specific circumstances that might occur,” House education policy leader Rep. Robert Behning said. \nThe principal of Turning Point Schools in Indianapolis told the House Education Committee that her school faced consequences despite dealing with a series of changes in academic standards and testing. She said the school has since raised its grade from a “D” to an “A,” while the amount of voucher money it has received fell from about $700,000 a year to $440,000, state data show. \n“Our students are growing. We are doing everything in our power, been doing everything the state has recommended to be able to provide a quality education to our students and moved them forward,” school leader LaQuila Dunn said. \nHowever, Rep. Vernon Smith, D-Gary, said the entire argument on vouchers is that they would be high performing. \n“Vouchers are supposed to be the answer, the cure-all, the panacea, the solution for what’s happening. Traditional schools that are in those low categories and those schools in low categories are not given an exemption,” Smith said. \nBut Behning, R-Indianapolis, said the state board has shown restraint in intervening in low-performing traditional public schools. Instead of taking over schools and assigning an outside operator, the board has allowed them to choose their own strategies “that would help them fix themselves,” he said. \nConsideration of the addition to House Bill 1384 comes during the same legislative session in which lawmakers may ease the ability of a student who received a state-funded pre-K scholarship to get a voucher for kindergarten. The program that began in 2011 has seen a rapid growth in its participation. Some 34,000 Hoosier schoolchildren are participating this school year. \nA vote on allowing voucher schools to petition the state board is expected today. 160 CONNECT 6 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/2lmfm22 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:29:37.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
