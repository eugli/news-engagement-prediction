Then again, who needs makeup when you're glowing naturally? \nPregnant Ciara ditched the heavy stuff Wednesday and appeared fresh-faced while attending the 2017 MAKERS Conference at the Terranea Resort in Rancho Palos Verdes, California with husband Russell Wilson , who was one of the speakers. \nKeys stopped wearing makeup last summer, saying in in an essay for Lena Dunham 's Lenny Letter , \"I don't want to cover up anymore. Not my face, not my mind, not my soul, not my thoughts, not my dreams, not my struggles, not my emotional growth. Nothing.\" Photos Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for AOL Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for AOL \nCiara also sported a demure fashion style to go along with her natural glow: She showcased her baby bump in a white, over-the-knee maternity dress and matching jacket and nude pointed kitten heels. \nCiara is pregnant with her second child and her first with Wilson. She has a 2 and 1/2-year-old son, Future Zahir , with her ex, rapper Future . \nThe singer wed Wilson in England last July and announced her pregnancy in October . \nMeanwhile, she is continuing her music career. Ciara recently made a major career move by signing a record deal with Warner Bros. Records. In a Facebook Live chat last month, she compared working on new music to another pregnancy. \n\"My next album is going to be my other baby,\" she said. \"So we've got two babies on the way!\" TAGS/ Ciara , Russell Wilson , Pregnancies , Makeup , Top Stories Additional  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T17:47:14.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
