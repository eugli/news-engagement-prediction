During a lot of the takes, I was just trying not to burst into laughter because of his some impromptu dance moves. He came to life when the whole production started. The director, Roman Coppola, would say “Yes! That’s the magic spot!” whenever he’d light up.\" \nThe \"Call Me Maybe\" hitmaker also gave glowing reviews about Yachty's comedic side. \"One of my favorite moments was filming the teasers with Yachty. We were just in a shopping cart going back and forth, and Roman was there shouting out directions to us. For some reason, we did about 20 takes of it. We were just in fits of giggles because Yachty was in his element. He could honestly be a comedian on top of everything.\" \nAccording to Jepsen, she was intimidated at the thought of rapping in front of Yachty and Mike Will while recording the song because of her inexperience. \"It was one of the most intimidating moments of my career being in the room with Mike Will and Yachty and sixteen other friends of theirs just partying. They’re like, “Alright, go perform your first-ever rap in front of actual professional rappers!” There’s nothing more terrifying than that. But they were really helpful,\" she says.In the snippet, Yachty provides his own spin on the timeless record. \"I wanna rock right now/I'm Lil Yachty and I'm down if you're down/I'm not the most lyrical kid known/but i'm known to keep the party going,\" he raps. \nCheck out a teaser of their remake of \"It Takes Two\" below. The official single will be out this Friday, Feb. 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:30:08.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
