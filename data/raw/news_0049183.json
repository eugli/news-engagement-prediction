(Photo: Rusty Mansell, 247Sports) \nOne of the best to test so far at any Nike event is 2019 UGA commit Nolan Smith of IMG Academy. \nSmith blew up the testing and scored a 40” vertical in a 6-foot-3, 223 pound frame. \nWith that being said Smith said right now he has one main goal and that is recruiting others to join him in Athens. \n“I have been recruiting a lot, lot, lot,” Smith said. \nIt is not just one, it is multiple players and especially those he is close to in the 2019 class in Georgia. \n“Keiondre (Jones) Tank, ( Jaylen McCollough ), just a lot of guys I am recruiting to Georgia, a lot of guys,” he said. \nThe message is simple to other recruits from Smith. \n“Kirby (Smart) is about to turn the program out and you are really about to see a change,” he said. \nSmith is so committed that rarely does not another school reach out to him anymore. \n“Not really, those schools know I am going to Georgia, that is why I am going there because I am wanted there,” he said. \nNot a member?

I learned that from the Pittsburgh Steelers DE, they won a game and he got straight off the plane and went to the weightroom.” \nThere is one date right now that Smith says cannot get here fast enough he says. \n“I will be back to Athens for the spring game, I tweeted out that spring game cannot come fast enough for me, I am just waiting and waiting to get up there.” \nKeith Neibuhr conducted this interview for 247Sports on site in Orlando.
