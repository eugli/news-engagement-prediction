February 16, 2017 by Kelsey Garcia 105 Shares \nA 7-year-old girl recently sent Sundar Pichai a letter inquiring about a job and ended up receiving the sweetest letter from the Google CEO. While it's safe to say she did not receive a formal job offer, she may now have an in at the company . . . once she's finished with school, of course. \nIn her initial letter, Chloe spoke about her love of technology, computers, and robots before asking about Google's job listings. In his response, Sundar wrote, \"I'm glad that you like computers and robots, and hope that you will continue to learn about technology. I think if you keep working hard and following your dreams, you can accomplish anything you set your mind to — from working at Google to swimming in the Olympics.\" Read the letter in its entirety, below. my 7 yr old daughter wrote to the boss of Google asking for a job, she's so made up he replied! Thanks @sundarpichai pic.twitter.com/EMuANNHiVc \n— Andy Bridgewater (@B21DGY) February 13, 2017 \nChloe's father later proudly shared the letter on Twitter and thanked Sundar. The tweet currently has more than 600 retweets and nearly 1,000 \"likes.\" Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:43:37.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
