She also said she would drastically cut back on performing in order to spend time with her grandchildren who are leaving for college. \n\"I must tell you, I am retiring this year,\" Franklin told WDIV Local 4. \nShe added: \"This will be my last year... I will be recording, but this will be my last year in concert. This is it.\" \n“I feel very, very enriched and satisfied with respect to where my career came from and where it is now,” Franklin said. “I’ll be pretty much satisfied, but I’m not going to go anywhere and just sit down and do nothing. That wouldn’t be good either.” \nFranklin, who turns 75 this year, has been performing for 56 years straight although in recent years has been suffering from ill health. In 2010, she had to put her career on hold following abdominal surgery and has slowed down her once prolific tour and performance schedule in recent years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T12:42:49.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
