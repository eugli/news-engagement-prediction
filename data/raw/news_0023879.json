His latest movie, Jolly LLB 2 , has courted controversy over \"depicting lawyers in bad light\". The matter went to the court and the movie is now scheduled to be released on its appointed day — February 10 — albeit with four cuts following directions from the Bombay High Court. The question now is will that hurt the box-office chances of the movie? Well, very few think so. In fact, most believe that the movie would benefit from the entire controversy. Screengrab: Jolly LLB 2 Moreover, with Shah Rukh Khan’s Raees and Hrithik Roshan’s Kaabil already doing well at the box office — both have entered the 100-crore club — there is a certain momentum gained by controversial releases. Indeed, 2017 started with a bang for Bollywood despite the cash crunch unleashed by demonetisation. Consequently, it’s highly likely that Jolly LLB 2 , which also stars Huma Qureshi, would deliver the fourth consecutive hit for the aging actor, Akshay Kumar. With his last three films having earned over Rs 100 crore, he has emerged as one of the rare consistent actors in Bollywood. Industry pundits say Akshay Kumar's film may give the recent big releases — Raees and Kaabil — a run for their money. Writer-director Subhash Kapoor’s Jolly LLB 2 , which is a stinging satire and sharp indictment of India’s judicial system, including lawyers, judges and corrupt cops, is a sequel to the 2013 hit. Kapoor’s previous hit Jolly LLB starred Arshad Warsi, who portrayed the character of a small-time lawyer who gets involved in a high-profile case of hit-and-run. Recent Bollywood history is replete with controversial releases setting the cash registers jingling. Besides, there are several examples of Bollywood movies going on to become hits after they got mired in controversy. For instance, Bajirao Mastani gained critical acclaim and box-office success despite strong protests by members of the Rajput community on the depiction of their ancestors. Petitions were filed, but that in no way affected the movie’s chances. In fact, many believe it helped the film run to packed houses. Jolly LLB 2 will evidently bank on the support of the middle-class cine-goers who have their interest piqued in anything controversial — the curiosity to see anything that's forbidden may get people to actually hit the theatres. Recent Bollywood history is replete with controversial releases setting the cash registers jingling — Aamir Khan’s PK , Shah Rukh Khan’s My Name is Khan , Shahid Kapoor’s Haider , among several others. Jodhaa Akbar too despite facing a ban in states such as Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Haryana made it to the Rs 100-crore club. Will history repeat itself? Well, let's wait and watch. #Films , #Controversy , #Bollywood The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of DailyO.in or the India Today Group.
