The dagger! #EDMvsCHI pic.twitter.com/q36LsjBx6q\n— @EdmontonOilers \"This game, we were just trying to get two points in a tough building to play in,\" Talbot said. \"We had a couple of good games throughout this week, and were just trying to keep that going.\"\nTalbot faces rubber Talbot, the NHL's busiest goalie in games and minutes played, lost a shutout bid when Richard Panik scored his 15th goal with 4:47 left. Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews earned his 600th NHL point with a nice pass on the play.\n\"There's two positives to tonight,\" Oilers coach Todd McLellan said. \"We got the points and Cam played tremendous.\n\"He was just in the zone. He faced a lot of rubber, had to be alert for a full 60 minutes.\"\nChicago had won five straight — all on the road. It was its first home game since Jan. 26.\nCorey Crawford made 19 saves for the Blackhawks, who were coming off a 5-1 victory at Edmonton last Saturday in their final game before their bye week. Chicago generated plenty of energy, but was rusty around the net.\n\"I can't speak for the other teams that came off [the bye], but I think we worked pretty hard today,\" Toews said. \"We had a lot of chances, we just couldn't find the back of the net.\"\nCoach Joel Quenneville agreed.\n\"I thought our shot selection around the net wasn't great,\" Quenneville said. \"We did have some good chances where we didn't elevate it, or we didn't have the traffic or the patience making good shots.\"\nThe Blackhawks outshot the Oilers 12-4 in a scoreless first period and had ample opportunities, including shots by Marian Hossa and Artemi Panarin that clanked off the post.\nBlackhawks come out flying \"They came out flying in the first,\" Talbot said. \"They knew we wanted redemption from last week and we were able to weather the storm.\"\nChicago dominated again for much of the second, outshooting Edmonton 16-9, but trailed 1-0 after 40 minutes.\nBenning opened the scoring with a fluke power-play goal at 5:02. Benning's centring pass from the right corner deflected in off the skate of Chicago defenseman Trevor van Riemsdyk, who was in the crease.\nWE'LL TAKE IT! #EDMvsCHI pic.twitter.com/UVbNeNQFeQ\n— @EdmontonOilers The Oilers were awarded a power play after Blackhawks rookie Ryan Hartman was penalized for instigating a fight with Edmonton's Eric Gryba after Gryba shoved him into the boards.\nLucic made it 2-0 at 9:50 of the third. He skated into the right circle, pulled up and stopped, then fired a low shot between Crawford's pads.\nLight 'em up, Looch! #EDMvsCHI pic.twitter.com/2N1g0VKAKJ\n— @EdmontonOilers\n© The Associated Press, 2017", "external_links": ["https://t.co/UVbNeNQFeQ", "https://twitter.com/EdmontonOilers/status/833124198121951234", "https://twitter.com/EdmontonOilers/status/833144150757404673", "https://t.co/q36LsjBx6q", "https://twitter.com/EdmontonOilers/status/833139388917874688", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/EDMvsCHI?src=hash", "https://t.co/2N1g0VKAKJ", "http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-19T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T09:37:28.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
