This weekend, the Kings sent the volcanic big man to the Pelicans for a forgettable mish-mash of bad players, expiring contracts, and future draft picks. They avoid ponying up an ungodly amount of cash for Cousins and, presumably, can now do something with their time other than sit around and think about trading DeMarcus Cousins. New Orleans, a bumbling organization that had been struggling to build around Anthony Davis, just had a second franchise player fall into their lap—and, seemingly by accident, made the West a lot more interesting. \nFrom a pure basketball standpoint, the move is staggering. Kings stalwart Tom Ziller, a writer not given to hyperbole, has declared it “one of the worst trades in NBA history.” After seven years of trying to make it work with Boogie, Sacramento’s front office has opted to gut their franchise for years to come. The Pelicans—a team that had long suffered from a lack of coaching imagination and weak guard play—get a newly-minted Twin Towers that instantly becomes the most terrifying frontcourt in the league. It’s a nearly fool-proof tandem. Cousins is an unmovable object who can create his own shot, make plays, stretch the floor, and protect the paint. At both ends of the floor, he’s the ideal complement to the reactive, rangy Davis, whose athleticism and shot-blocking prowess make him one of the league’s most dangerously resourceful players. Overnight, the Pelicans went from a team in perpetual crisis to a force to be reckoned with.

Cousins, at this point the most dominant big man in the league, is by no means an easy athlete to unpack. His talent level is through the roof and he only gets better with each passing season. He’s an outsized personality whose energy could easily drive a team. And for all his antics, DeMarcus Cousins clearly wants to win, even if the red flags have always been there. Seemingly incapable of self-censoring, he wears his emotions on his sleeve, pouts when things don’t go his way, and clashes with coaches he can’t bring himself to unconditionally respect. While you’d never say he’s squandered his gifts, Cousins is his own worst distraction. He’s simply too good to effectively self-sabotage, but at times he comes damn close. \nTo the Kings’ credit, with Cousins things were never simple, especially not early on. But as he’s matured and grown into a perennial All-Star, the incompetence of the Kings—especially owner Vivek Ranadive—has become all the more glaring. If Cousins represented a challenge, the Kings were almost certainly not up to the task. And while there have been a few bright spots, the team has largely failed to keep up or ever really get on the same page as their ascendant superstar. \nIn theory, athletes are supposed to be good soldiers. But that’s just not the reality of professional sports, especially the NBA. Players may literally work for teams, but it’s incumbent on the team to figure out how to work with someone of Cousins’s caliber. You can’t offer up, say, Tim Duncan as the counter-example when the Spurs run an undeniably tight ship and very rarely make mistakes. LeBron James is the most powerful figure in the NBA and enjoys considerable power and influence in Cleveland, in large part because he trusts the franchise. The Cavs have been willing to view him as a partner, not a fractious employee or adversarial nuisance. While contracts bind players to teams—Cousins’ impending payday was massive enough that he was supposedly willing to stick around in Sacramento—no one wants an unhappy superstar, especially when free agency always looms. Cousins was regularly the subject of trade rumors because he was stuck with a team that viewed him as a static either/or proposition, one that simply never acknowledged the part it had to play. \nThe biggest winner here might be Davis. At one point expected to become the league’s Next Big Thing, he was dangerously close to, like Cousins, toiling in obscurity for a lottery-bound team that never seemed quite sure of what to do with him. There was growing concern that, through no fault of his own, Davis’s prime might be utterly wasted. Davis never raised a fuss or came even remotely close to expressing disapproval with the Pelicans, but it was hard to look at the situation as sustainable in the long-term. Now New Orleans, if still patchy, becomes the most riveting wild card in the league. If on the court Cousins will take some of the pressure off of Davis to be all things at all times—he’s just not that type of player—then Davis’s willingness to play the long game and adapt makes him just the guy to mitigate and maybe even rub off on Cousins. \nThere’s more at stake here than Cousins’s redemption, Davis’s seemingly karmic come-up, or the now potentially bright future of the Pelicans. Heading into this weekend, New Orleans had an outside chance of sneaking into the playoffs (yes, the West is that weak once you get past the marquee teams). If they start rolling with Cousins in tow, they’d be facing a first-round match-up against the mighty Warriors. That might seem like an anti-climactic way to wrap up a season that, in one weekend, went from lost to mind-blowingly fortuitous. Except if there’s thing that exposes Golden State’s limitations, it’s big men like Cousins or Davis, for whom they simply have no clear-cut answer. Put two of them on one team and there’s every reason to believe that things could get interesting. \nThe Kings may have made a ridiculously bad move. But they’ve succeeded in turning things around for two of the NBA’s best players. For that, the league—and its fans—owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude.
