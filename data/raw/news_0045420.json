Juliet. File photo A publicly traded company based outside Detroit now owns the sixth-largest shopping center in Middle Tennessee â€” paying a price that ranks among the largest real estate deals in recent years. The Providence MarketPlace outdoor mall in Mt. Juliet sold for $114.7 million to Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust (NYSE:RPT), of Farmington Hills, Mich. The transaction closed on Feb. 17, according to real estate brokerage firm CBRE Inc. The firm represented the seller, which was the pension fund for the city and county of San Francisco. This 2010 photo shows commercial development along Providence Way in Mt. Juliet. File photo That purchase price ranks as the ninth-largest real estate deal in the region since 2005, according to our research. Two of the four biggest sales also involve shopping malls, The Mall at Green Hills and The Avenue Murfreesboro. Providence MarketPlace is the sixth-biggest shopping center in the region, with about 828,000 square feet of gross leasable space, according to our List research. It is located in the second fastest-growing counties in Tennessee , almost 20 miles east of downtown Nashville on Interstate 40. As of last fall, Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust owned and managed a portfolio of 66 shopping centers nationwide, according to the company's website. The Mt. Juliet center is the company's first property in Tennessee, according to its website . CIM Group, of Los Angeles, which owns downtown Nashville's L&C Tower , advised the San Francisco City & County Employees Retirement System on operating the mall. CIM Group retained real estate brokerage firm JLL (NYSE: JLL), formally Jones Lang LaSalle, to manage the mall, according to David Heydasch , a JLL employee who is the mall's general manager. That listing may change, depending on the wishes of the new ownership. The 103-acre Providence MarketPlace was developed in the mid-2000s by Charlotte developer Crosland Inc. and South Carolina-based Carolina Holdings Inc. The San Francisco pension fund bought the mall shortly after it opened, Heydasch said. Adam covers commercial real estate and manufacturing. Ranked by Gross leasable area (sq. ft.)
