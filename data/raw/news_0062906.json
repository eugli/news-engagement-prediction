(Courtesy of Gary Corsair) Christal Hayes offered apologies and pushed lawmakers to exonerate the men, but came up empty handed. \nOfficials are hoping the local effort might help this year. \n“We’re hoping the state will wake up and see the grave injustice and that we have the power to fix it,” former Groveland Mayor Tim Loucks said. “I have good faith that this year might be the year.” \nLoucks said both proclamations in the city and county were filed too late to make a difference during the last legislative session. \nThe bill calls for the acknowledgment of the “grave injustice” against Charles Greenlee, Walter Irvin, Samuel Shepherd, and Ernest Thomas, who were accused of raping a 17-year-old white girl in 1949. \nAll four men have died. Now, 68 years after the alleged crime, the families of the men might get some closure. \nThe case against the Groveland Four in the racially divided South caused chaos throughout the region, leading to a white mob destroying a black community near the city. \nThe National Guard was even called to bring order back to the area. \nFacts about the case were called into question by Gilbert King's Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \"Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys, and the Dawn of a New America.\" \nThe book chronicles Lake County’s past race relation issues and attempts to prove the allegations against the men were false. \nIt also included documents that showed the doctor who examined the alleged rape victim didn't find evidence of a sexual assault. \nchayes@orlandosentinel.com, 407-420-5493 or Twitter: @journo_christal", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:40:59.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
