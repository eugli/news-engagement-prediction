This turn of events follows shortly after the Secure Folder APK file was leaked online earlier this week. As expected, Secure Folder is only compatible with the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge running Android 7.0 Nougat. Owners of Samsung’s 2016 flagship duo that are still running Marshmallow won’t be able to find the device on the Galaxy Apps store and attempts to sideload it will only result in a system error saying that Android encountered a problem while trying to parse the package. The app started rolling out on the Galaxy Apps store on Friday so you may have to wait a few hours before it becomes available for download in your territory. \nThe Secure Folder app was originally expected to be introduced simultaneously with the Android 7.0 Nougat update for the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge, but the Seoul-based tech giant opted to push the next major iteration of Android without its convenient app. The mobile tool initially debuted on the Galaxy Note 7 but consumers were quickly prevented from using it seeing how Samsung was forced to discontinue its faulty phablet only a few months after launching it. On the bright side, not only is Secure Folder now available on the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge, but the app will also soon find its way to more Samsung-made devices, the company confirmed on Friday. While no details on the matter have yet been provided by Samsung, it’s reasonable to presume that more devices from the Galaxy lineup will get Secure Folder once they’re updated to Nougat. \nNaturally, that assumption still doesn’t lead to a specific timeframe seeing how not even the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge may be updated to Nougat in all parts of the world before the second quarter of the year. However, more details on the rollout of Secure Folder will hopefully follow soon. In the meantime, owners of Samsung’s 2016 flagship duo may download the app by visiting the Galaxy Apps store.
