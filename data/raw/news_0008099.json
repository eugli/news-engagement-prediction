Stewart is an executive producer of “Late Show” but is not a hands-on presence. Judging by the clip below, the Stewart and Colbert discuss the headlines and controversy stirred by the first few days of the Trump administration. \nStewart’s visit to “Late Show” raises the question about the status his deal to deliver topical short-form content for HBO’s various platforms. Stewart signed a wide-ranging production pact with HBO in 2015 after ending his nearly 17-year run on Comedy Central’s “Daily Show.” \nSources close to the situation said Stewart continues to work on a venture to produce timely animated programming using cutting-edge technology. Fans had expected that Stewart would use the HBO platform to comment on the raucous 2016 presidential election, but no material to date has surfaced. Sources emphasized that the technology is new and the production infrastructure is still being assembled. But Stewart remains committed to the HBO deal.
