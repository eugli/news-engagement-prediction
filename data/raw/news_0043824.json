But will Tina agree with her belief that Sylvie needs a higher level of care? And will Shirley even listen as she struggles to cope with managing Sylvie’s behaviour? \nTina and Shirley have been jointly trying to care for Sylvie but Shirley has always found it a challenge. And when Tina makes a shocking discovery about how Shirley has been coping, the pair are forced to have a frank discussion. \nAs Shirley tells Tina that they need to put Sylvie back into care for everyone’s sakes, Tina is naturally unsure – but Shirley is determined that things can’t go on as they are. (Picture: BBC) \nIt remains to be seen whether EastEnders viewers will be saying goodbye to Sylvie but with the Carter family already struggling to get by under the weight of so many problems, it seems likely that Shirley will not take no for an answer this time. \nOne to watch: Tuesday 28th February at 7:30pm on BBC One.
