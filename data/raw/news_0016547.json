He was looking around and took a deep breath. He perfectly executed the performance, which clocked in at just over 2 minutes. During a recent interview Bryan said, “I’m just excited for the opportunity to go out there and honor America, honor our country, and honor our troops. And I will certainly be excited to hit the last note and not be so nervous anymore and go enjoy a football game.” . @LukeBryanOnline performs the National Anthem prior to #SB51 ! https://t.co/xR5kEdBuDz — NFL (@NFL) February 5, 2017 Grateful to be here with everyone. #SuperBowl pic.twitter.com/GSUSOiLaXo — Luke Bryan (@LukeBryanOnline) February 5, 2017 Now that his performance is over, he can cheer on his home team the Atlanta Falcons.
