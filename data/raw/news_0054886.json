Offer it to me at a lower price,” Sarah begs, pretending to be distraught. “It’s just who my aunt Judy was.” \nClearly, Sarah’s acting skills are convincing because the man sells the vacuum for the suggested number: “Okay, okay, I’ll let you have it for $15.” \n“Oh thank you, thank you,” says Sarah, who walks away with a smile on her face, clearly revealing that she made up the morbid story about the death of her aunt all for the sake of the vacuum. \nAlthough Jessica is the queen of a good sale, she can spot a fellow negotiator when she sees one and gives a smirk of approval as Sarah walks away. \nLocklear’s Fresh Off the Boat episode, “The Gloves Are Off,” airs Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET on ABC.
