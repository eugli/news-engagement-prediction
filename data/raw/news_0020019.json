But other sources with knowledge of the negotiations say talks are still very much ongoing. \nOn Monday, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Janice Min, its top editor, would take on a new role at Eldridge overseeing \"media-investment strategy\" -- meaning sales and acquisitions. In that role, Min would help facilitate any deal with Condé Nast. \nUnder Min, THR has grown from a largely irrelevant trade magazine into Hollywood's most influential publication. Perhaps most importantly to Condé Nast, it has also become relevant to readers in New York and Washington, competing at times with esteemed Condé Nast publications like Vanity Fair. \nBoth Condé Nast and Eldridge declined to comment.
