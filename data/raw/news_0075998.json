By seizing this opportunity, we can be confident that we will not be short-changing the many generations to come, who should be benefiting from our proactive leadership.” Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nDel Rosario warned there would be contradicting forces acting on the content and speed of completion of the framework, noting it already took at least a decade and a half to craft the COC. \nHe noted that with the use of proxies, China had continued to delay its forward movement. \nChina, he said, assumed a delaying strategy as it needed more time to complete its unlawful expansion agenda in the South China Sea. \n“Now that China has virtually completed its unlawful agenda, including militarization, it may take a new position of acceding to advance the framework, as long as it does not adversely affect what it has developed in the South China Sea,” Del Rosario said. \n“If we are not careful, the framework may even be used to preserve China’s unlawful expansion gains, and should it arise, we must prevent this from happening,” he added. \nThe country’s former top diplomat stressed that the Philippines must make every effort to tell the whole world that advocating a rules-based regime is what the country is and what it does. \nWith the Philippines’ victory at The Hague, Del Rosario said, the country must determine what its options are toward advancing national interest. \nAs the architect of the Philippine foreign policy, President Duterte has decided to manifest the softest diplomacy possible toward China by offering, among other considerations, to shelve any discussions on the tribunal outcome. \nChina’s cold and calculated response to this was to proceed in further militarizing the reclaimed islands. \nYasay said on Tuesday the ASEAN had expressed concern over recent developments and militarization in the South China Sea, with China’s installation of weapon systems. \nSince diplomacy is about reciprocity, Del Rosario said, the government’s response has raised questions on whether to revisit the foreign policy strategy. \n“We must not accept the position that China’s completion of its unlawful expansion agenda must be considered as a fait accompli that renders us helpless,” Del Rosario said. \n“According to the ruling based on UNCLOS, what China has done in the South China Sea is unlawful. It behooves us, therefore, to start from there, and not end there.” \nDel Rosario said various foreign officials had discussed their sentiments and reaction to the Philippines’ shelving of the arbitral outcome.
