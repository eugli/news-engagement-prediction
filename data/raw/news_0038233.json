A shot was fired hitting the 17-year-old in the chest. Police arrived minutes later. \n“The homeowner was actually attempting to resuscitate the teen after he shot them,” said Sgt. VaNessa Harrison with the Arlington Police Department. “He wanted to try to work on him until the police arrived and then when the police arrived they took that over.” \nThe teenager died. As of Monday evening the Tarrant County Medical Examiner had not released the young man’s identity. \nPolice are trying to figure out exactly what happened in the seconds before the shooting. \nThe law says deadly force can be used to prevent theft during the nighttime, to prevent a person fleeing after a theft during the nighttime and the property owner has to be believe the property can’t be recovered or protected by other means. \nPolice say a car in the driveway is considered an extension of a home, which means investigators have to piece together some key facts. \n“Where the shooting occurred, where the teenager was when he got shot and also the timeframe matters as well,” said Sgt. Harrison. \nPolice say the 19-year-old came to the police station Sunday night and is cooperating with investigators. \nMeantime, neighbors said this is a sad story no matter how you look at it. \n“All around it, it’s hard for everyone, you know? I’m sure like, in that situation I don’t want to have to shoot anybody for anything like that,” Hutchins said. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc. All Rights Reserved.
