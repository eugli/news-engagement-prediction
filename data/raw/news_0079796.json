protectionism in the history of the United Kingdom”, George Osborne has warned.\nThe former chancellor said that making trade deals with other countries around the world was not going to make up for the loss of trade caused by a hard Brexit that saw Britain slide out of the trade bloc.\nTheresa May said in a speech at the start of the year that Britain “cannot possibly” remain in the single market after Brexit and that staying in “would not mean leaving the EU at all”. She has since said that if MPs reject her Brexit deal Britain will crash out of the bloc with no special provisions.\nRead more May's post-Brexit plan for economy 'would not come close' to working But on Tuesday Mr Osborne put himself on a collision course with the Prime Minister, telling the British Chambers of Commerce’s annual conference in Westminster:\n“Let’s make sure that we go on doing trade with our biggest export market, otherwise withdrawing from the single market would be the biggest single act of protectionism in the history of United Kingdom and no amount of trade deals with New Zealand are going to replace the amount of trade we do with our European neighbours.”\nMr Osborne said that Britain had taken the decision to leave the European Union and that it would do so. He however said that the “devil’s going to be in the details” and that a number of questions about trade policy and immigration had been left unanswered.\n“There were a whole set of other questions that we were not asked” at the referendum, he said.\nRead more John Major accuses Theresa May's Government of misleading over Brexit Brexit won’t save the UK from being affected by the Greek debt crisis George Osborne joins asset management firm Blackrock George Osborne named as highest earning MP of 2016 George Osborne does not 'regret' decision to hold referendum “The country has answered a question, which is do we want to leave the EU or not? They answered ‘yes we do’, and we’re leaving the European Union. In my view, that decision has been taken.\n“There were a whole set of other questions that we were not asked – what do you want your immigration policy to look like, what do you want your trade policy to look like, what do you want your business policy to look like? They are now before us as a country and we’re going to have to make decisions on them. That’s where the devil’s going to be in the details.\n“Take immigration – do you want to have access to a skilled workforce around the world that wants to come and work in Britain, do you, as David Davis was saying the other day, want to have people who are maybe not so highly skilled coming to fill gaps in agriculture or catering and the like? That’s going to be the immigration decision we’ve got to take.\n“Do you want to go on paying farming subsidies paid for by other taxpayers, do you want to make sure industry competes in a fair and free market or are you going to allow secretaries of states to make decisions to support individual companies and is that a good thing? There are a whole range of questions and my sense is that there’s quite a lot of fighting the last war – fighting the referendum campaign that’s taken place where there was a clear decision.\nBrexit Concerns 26 show all Brexit Concerns 1/26 Brexit will put British patients at 'back of the queue' for new drugs Brexit will put British patients at the “back of the queue” for vital new drugs, the Government has been warned – forcing them to wait up to two years longer A medicines regulator has raised the alarm over a likely decision to pull out of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), as well as the EU itself. ealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt dropped the bombshell , when he said he expected the UK would quit the EMA – because it is subject to rulings by the European Court of Justice.\nGetty Images\n2/26 London to lose status as 'gateway to Europe' for banks One of Germany’s top banking regulators has warned that London could lose its status as “gateway to Europe” for the banking sector after Britain quits the European trading bloc. Andreas Dombret, who is an executive board member for the Bundesbank—Germany’s central bank—told a private meeting of German businesses and banks earlier this week in Frankfurt that even if banking rules were “equivalent” between the UK and the rest of the EU, that was still “miles away from [Britain having] access to the single market”, the BBC reports.\nJason Hawkes\n3/26 Exodus The number of financial sector professionals in Britain and continental Europe looking for jobs in Ireland rocketed in the months after the UK voted to leave the European Union\nShutterstock\n4/26 Brexit is making FTSE 100 executives richer Pay packages of many FTSE 100 chief executive officers are partly tied to how well share prices are doing rather than the CEO’s performance -- and some stocks are soaring. ritish equities got a boost since the June vote because the likes of Rio Tinto, Smiths Group and WPP generate most sales abroad and earn a fortune when they convert these revenues back into the weakened pound. Sterling’s fall also made UK stocks more affordable for overseas investors.\nRex\n5/26 Theresa May: UK to leave single market Theresa May has said the UK \"cannot possibly\" remain within the European single market, as staying in it would mean \"not leaving the EU at all\".\nGetty\n6/26 Lead campaigner Gina Miller and her team outside the High Court\nGetty\n7/26 Raymond McCord holds up his newly issued Irish passport alongside his British passport outside the High Court in Belfast following a judges dismissal of the UK's first legal challenges to Brexit\nPA wire\n8/26 SDLP leader Colum Eastwood leaving the High Court in Belfast following a judges dismissal of the UK's first legal challenges to Brexit\nPA wire\n9/26 Migrants with luggage walk past a graffiti on a wall as they leave the 'Jungle' migrant camp, as part of a major three-day operation planned to clear the camp in Calais\nGetty\n10/26 Migrants leave messages on their tents in the Jungle migrant camp\nGetty\n11/26 The Adventist Development and Relief Agency (Adra) which distributes approximately 700 meals daily in the northern Paris camp states that it is noticing a spike in new migrant arrivals this week, potentially linked the the Calais 'jungle' camp closure - with around 1000 meals distributed today\nEPA\n12/26 Migrant workers pick apples at Stocks Farm in Suckley, Britain\nReuters\n13/26 Many farmers across the country are voicing concerns that Brexit could be a dangerous step into the unknown for the farming industry\nGetty\n14/26 Bank of England governor Mark Carney who said the long-term outlook for the UK economy is positive, but growth was slowing in the wake of the Brexit vote\nPA\n15/26 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down over 600 points on the news with markets around the globe pluninging\nGetty\n16/26 Immigration officers deal with each member of the public seeking entry into the United Kingdom but on average, 10 a day are refused entry at this London airport and between 2008 and 2009, 33,100 people were detained at the airport for mainly passport irregularities\nGetty\n17/26 A number of global investment giants have threatened to move their European operations out of London if Brexit proves to have a negative impact on their businesses\nGetty\n18/26 Following the possibility of a Brexit the UK would be released from its renewable energy targets under the EU Renewable Energy Directive and from EU state aid restrictions, potentially giving the government more freedom both in the design and phasing out of renewable energy support regimes\nGetty\n19/26 A woman looking at a chart showing the drop in the pound (Sterling) against the US Dollar in London after Britain voted to leave the EU\nGetty\n20/26 Young protesters outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, to protest against the United Kingdom's decision to leave the EU following the referendum\nGetty\n21/26 Applications from Northern Ireland citizens for Irish Passports has soared to a record high after the UK Voted in favour of Leaving the EU\nGetty\n22/26 NFU Vice President Minette Batters with Secretary of State, Andrea Leadsome at the National Farmers Union (NFU) took machinery, produce, farmers and staff to Westminster to encourage Members of Parliament to back British farming, post Brexit\nGetty\n23/26 The latest reports released by the UK Cabinet Office warn that expats would lose a range of specific rights to live, to work and to access pensions, healthcare and public services.
