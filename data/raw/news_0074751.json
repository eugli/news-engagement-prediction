The car — a 2007 Ferrari F430 F1 Coupe — is expected to go for $250,000 to $350,000 at Auctions America’s Fort Lauderdale event on April 1, CNN reports. “It’s well known that President Trump appreciates the finer things in life and this Ferrari F430 is no exception. At the time of its release, it was one of the most technologically advanced performance cars on the market,” Auctions America wrote, according to CNN, which also said that it’s “highly likely Donald Trump is the only United States president to ever own a supercar.” Trump reportedly bought the car when he was 60 years old, but didn’t drive it much — it only had 6,000 miles on it when he sold it in 2011, CNN reports. The cherry red supercar boasts a V-8 engine, can reach 196 mph, and has a six-disc CD changer. But according to CNN, there’s more: Whoever buys the Ferrari will also receive a copy of the original title boasting Trump’s recognizable “bold signature.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:37:59.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
