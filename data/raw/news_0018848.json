He will follow Philippe Coutinho's lead in committing to Klopp's project and the financial terms that are being discussed put him in the bracket alongside the Brazilian, in terms of his importance. Klopp is a huge fan of Lallana and once described him as being his 'biggest surprise' after he arrived to take over in October 2015, such is his willingness to execute the German's gameplan. Once Lallana's business is concluded, Liverpool will then look to finalise a deal with Dejan Lovren, who arrived from Southampton at the same time as Lallana in the summer of 2014. The former Southampton midfielder has just over two years to run on his current deal Lovren, too, has two years remaining on his contract but Liverpool want to keep him. There is no sign, however, of talks with Emre Can, the Germany international, reaching a point where he can put pen to paper. Klopp is already plotting the next stage of Liverpool's development and once he has the futures of the core members of the current group secured, he will begin the process of recruitment. It promises to be another busy summer at Anfield, with Klopp keen on signing Borussia Dortmund's Christian Pulisic and Julian Brandt of Bayer Leverkusen. There will, however, be more additions, given that Liverpool are on course to be back in Europe. The squad will need more depth and quality to withstand the amount of fixtures. Lallana is keen to stay on Merseyside and would be happy to finish his career with Liverpool RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:03:36.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
