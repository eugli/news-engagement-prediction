(AP Photo/Duane Burleson) DTS109 08052004xSports 05302009xSPORTS 05152010xSPORTS By Barry Horn , Staff Writer Contact Barry Horn on Twitter: @bhorn55 \nMike Bacsik is the only local radio sports talk host with a daily gig who actually played games at an advanced level. The son of major-league pitcher, also Mike Bacsik, he played high school baseball at Duncanville before embarking on a professional career as a left-handed pitcher that began in 1996 and lasted through 2008. \nHe spent parts of five seasons in the major leagues, pitching for the Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, New York Mets and Washington Nationals. \nHis signature moment may have come with the Nationals in 2007 when he gave up Barry Bonds' 756 th home run. That allowed Bonds to break the 33-year-old career record held by Hank Aaron. Bacsik famously tipped his cap to the home run king after being taken deep. \nNow married to a doctor and the father of three, he got into sports talk as an intern at Sportsradio 1310 and 96.7 Ticket. He currently works the 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift at 105.3 The Fan as a member of G-Bag Nation. \nTo his everlasting regret, he used his Twitter account during the 2010 NBA playoffs to unleash offensive comments aimed at Spurs fans in San Antonio. That ended his time at The Ticket and paved the way for his move to The Fan. G-Bag debuted in September 2013. \nWell, spring training has started. Miss it? \nBacsik: I still get excited, I love going to spring training with the G-Bag Nation but it always makes me think about going back to the game and coaching. Then I think about that lifestyle and realize how much I would miss my family. \nWhat exactly does \"G-Bag Nation\" mean? \nBacsik : Good Broadcasting About Games or nothing at all. Your choice. \nHow much of a signing bonus did the Indians ante up when they drafted you in the 18 th round in 1996 out of Duncanville High School? \nBacsik: $150,000 \nDid you expect to go higher in the draft? \nBacsik: Yes, but teams thought I was going to Texas Tech and wouldn't sign for less than $500,000. Cleveland called me in the 5th round and said \"$100,000 take or leave it.\" I said \"$200,000\" and they hung up the phone. \nWho was the first batter you faced in a major league game? \nBacsik: Mike Cameron of the Seattle Mariners. Bases loaded. 3-2 count. He hit a double off the left field wall. \nWhat was your \"out\" pitch? \nBacsik: Didn't have one. That is why I kept getting sent back to the minors. Best pitch was the change-up. \nWhat's the best piece of baseball-related advice your father gave you? \nBacsik: Honestly, nothing stands out because there was plenty of good advice from my dad during my career. If I was struggling I would ask him to fly in and help. He was a better pitching coach than any I ever had. \nHappy or sad you played a significant role in Barry Bonds' record-breaking home run? \nBacsik: I'm okay with it. It led to opportunities for my second career, so I'll lean happy. \nWhy did you get into the radio business? \nBacsik : I loved listening to sports talk radio \nHow did you get into the business? \nBacsik: I met Dan McDowell in 2003 in the clubhouse in Arlington when I was with the Mets. We became friends and in 2005 I interned for BaD Radio in the off-season. My baseball career ended in 2008 and The Ticket hired me part time. \nWhat do you like most about your job? Least? \nBacsik: I love that I get to talk about sports for a living. The tough part is coming up with five hours of content everyday for The G-Bag Nation. \nHow much do you regret tweeting during the 2010 NBA playoffs? \nBacsik: A whole bunch doesn't express it enough. But I had to move on and turn it into a positive. \nWhat did you think when The Fan called about a job? \nBacsik : I didn't think there would be a second opportunity. I was very happy to have a chance to work again. I have to thank Bruce Gilbert and Gavin Spittle (the executives who hired him) every chance I get. \nWhat's it like being married to a pediatrician? \nBacsik: I love having a wife that chased her dreams and became what she wanted to be. She is a great role model that I hope and pray our kids follow. It also helps that she diagnoses our kids without paying for it. \nWhat's the one question I should have asked? \nBacsik: Why do you like basketball more than baseball? \nAnd? \nBacsik: As a kid I wanted to play in the NBA more than the MLB. But as I got to high school age I realized that my path to playing professional sports was baseball even though colleges were interested in me for basketball. I love the NBA game. It was and is still my favorite sport to watch. \n@bhorn55 This Topic is Missing Your Voice.
