Disaster Enter Eric Holder. Twitter By Mike Windle/Getty Images for Vanity Fair. Uber C.E.O. Travis Kalanick moved swiftly in response to his company’s second major public-relations crisis in a month, ordering an “urgent investigation” into the claims of a former female engineer who excoriated the ride-hailing giant for ignoring her complaints about sexual harassment in a widely shared blog post . On Monday, Kalanick issued a memo announcing a series of steps the company will take in the wake of Susan Fowler’s essay, which prompted conversations about workplace sexism in Silicon Valley on social media and had Uber customers once again deleting their accounts in outrage. Kalanick also told employees Monday that the company has tapped Eric Holder, who served as attorney general under President Barack Obama , to investigate, Recode reports . He reiterated that Uber board member Arianna Huffington and Uber’s head of human resources, Liane Hornsey, would also be part of the investigation. “I believe in creating a workplace where a deep sense of justice underpins everything we do,” Kalanick said in his memo. “Every Uber employee should be proud of the culture we have and what we will build together over time. What is driving me through all this is a determination that we take what’s happened as an opportunity to heal wounds of the past and set a new standard for justice in the workplace.” Kalanick also said that he would release diversity numbers for Uber soon, adding that 15.1 percent of the company’s technical staff are women. Kalanick’s invocation of “justice” may be too late for some customers, who have criticized’s Uber response to issues involving women in the past. In 2014, a New York–based executive for the company was investigated after using an internal tool known as “God View” to track the location of a female BuzzFeed reporter. A 2014 French Uber promotion promised to pair up riders with “hot chick” drivers (“Who said women don’t know how to drive?” Uber's blog post asked, before it was deleted). And female passengers have asked Uber to do more to take their safety seriously, even prompting one former Uber driver to start a women-only ride-hailing company to compete with Uber. With his new gig as an internal investigator at Uber, Holder is quickly becoming a go-to ethical consultant for Silicon Valley companies in need of a P.R. makeover. Last year, after Airbnb received complaints that some customers had faced racial discrimination from other users when trying to book lodging, C.E.O. Brian Chesky tapped Holder to develop an anti-discrimination policy. Uber, too, is hoping to put users’ minds at ease with a high-powered hired gun. The $68 billion private company learned a hard lesson at the end of January, when it announced during a taxi-driver work stoppage over Donald Trump’s travel ban that it would drop surge pricing at J.F.K. airport—inciting a swift backlash from angry customers who viewed it as an opportunistic move. Some 200,000 people reportedly deleted their Uber accounts in response, despite Kalanick’s efforts to denounce the ban and offer legal and financial support to affected drivers. As Uber discovered, corporate brand management is now a 24/7 job—particularly when President Trump has super-charged the news cycle and when silence is considered by many to equal complicity. In the wake of its second public-relations disaster in three weeks, Uber is moving quickly to get ahead of the story—even if it costs a few people their jobs. In a statement Sunday, Kalanick said : “We seek to make Uber a just workplace FOR EVERYONE and there can be absolutely no place for this kind of behavior at Uber—and anyone who behaves this way or thinks this is O.K. will be fired.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:41:51.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
