Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images House of Cards creator Beau Willimon is no stranger to the darker side of politics, but based on his latest tweets, it seems clear that he doesn’t want life to imitate art. In a series of 25 tweets, which Willimon titled his “Declaration of Resistance,” he called for “the people to save our Nation from a Tyrant.” Willimon goes on to outline the “crimes” committed by Trump, including the refugee ban, dismissal of an attorney general, and treading on the separation of church and state. Read his full declaration below. \n\n1. DECLARATION OF RESISTANCE\n\nWhen in the course of American history it becomes necessary for the people to save our Nation from a Tyrant,\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 2. To safeguard equality for all and their inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness from bigotry and corruption,\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 3. To ensure that our Government continues derive its power from the consent of the governed rather than by autocracy,\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 4. That whenever any President becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to make such demands upon their Congress:\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 5. Immediate impeachment of the President for crimes committed, or removal from office by way of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 6. Donald J. Trump has conducted injuries and usurpations, pursuing the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 7. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world--\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 8. He has obstructed the Laws for Naturalization of Immigrants, and illegally banned refugees in need of safe haven.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 9. He has continued to violate federal court orders which require the temporary cessation of this ban, thereby violating his executive oath.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 10. He has dismissed an Attorney General for fulfilling her oath to defend the Constitution, defying the autonomy of the Dept. of Justice.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 11. He has purged the State Dept. of its highest level officials without any regard for a responsible continuity of State Affairs.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 12. He has enlisted amateur ideologues – such as the white supremacist Stephen L. Bannon – to make national security decisions.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 13. He has vowed to enact policy and legislation which clearly tread on the separation of church and state.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 14. He has refused to remove or address conflicts of interest regarding both his own business and that of his cabinet and family.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 15. He has hastily signed multiple Executive Orders without the advisement of Congress, policy experts, his cabinet or staff.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 16. He has signed an Executive Order which knowingly deprives the sick of desperately needed healthcare with no concern for their lives.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 17. He has signed an Executive Order permitting a pipeline that tramples on Native American Rights and endangers safe water supply.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 18. He has illegally threatened to cut off funding to Sanctuary Cities which have determined their values through self-governance.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 19. He has knowingly, repeatedly and egregiously misled the public, and directed his staff to do the same.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 20. He has strongly advocated for the silencing and suppression of a Free Press.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 21. He has repeatedly and consistently shown contempt for people based race, ethnicity, gender, sexual identity and religion.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 22. He has shown disdain and disregard for the judiciary, and the fundamental human rights that are the foundation of Justice.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 23. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 24. We shall Resist until our Congress uses the mechanisms afforded to by the Constitution to remove this Tyrant from Power.\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 25. And for the support of this Declaration we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our Honor.\n\nSigned. The Resistance\n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 Tags: beau willimon house of cards trump declaration of resistance Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories John Lithgow is Joining the Cast of Pitch Perfect 3 All the Barack Obama TV Specials to Watch Right Now, Ranked House of Cards Creator Calls for Trump’s Impeachment Most Viewed Stories What’s New on Netflix: February 2017 Why A-List Actresses Don’t Make Romantic Comedies Anymore The Serial Creators’ Next Podcast Series Sounds Like a Juicy, Bingeable Delight There Was One Explicit Sex Scene in Girls That Even HBO Wouldn’t Allow South Park ’s Creators Say They Don’t Know How to Approach Satire in the Age of Trump What to Stream Now See what's new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBO Grey’s Anatomy Recap: This Means War How to Get Away With Murder Recap: Quite Frankly Bruce Springsteen Trolls Trump Following Recent Phone-Call Debacle by Covering ‘Don’t Hang Up’ in Australia Is Wayne’s World Still Excellent 25 Years Later?
