Karrueche says in her sworn statement in the case that he “told a few people that he was going to kill” her and “threatened to shoot” her as well as saying that if he couldn’t date her, then she was off limits to anyone else. \nShe also testifies that Brown physically assaulted her, including punching her in the stomach and pushing her down some stairs. \nBrown posted a clip to Instagram Tuesday afternoon, vaguely addressing “this bullshit” and telling his fans not to listen to “what the people on the other side doing.” Feb 21, 2017 at 12:22pm PST \nBrown was given five years probation in 2009 for assaulting Rihanna . \nThe Virginia artist made headlines a month ago when he posted an Instagram video admitting he was a jealous boyfriend . \n“If I love you, bitch, ain’t nobody gon’ have you,” he said. “Imma make you miserable.
