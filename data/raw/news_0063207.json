It was expected that Mourinho would rest several key players tonight ahead of Sunday's EFL Cup final against Southampton, yet the Portuguese coach obviously has other ideas, much to Hamouma's chagrin. \n\"Ibrahimovic isn't playing, right? He is? Shit! How many goals has he scored against us? 17, right? What do you want me to say?\" Ibrahimovic continued his ridiculous run of form against St.Etienne, last week. Image: PA \nIt would appear that you've said everything you need to, Romain. \nHamouma did start the previous game at Old Trafford, so perhaps he's still waking up in cold sweats, enduring nightmares of Zlatan's scrappiest ever hat-trick. When you hear you're facing Zlatan, again. Image: PA \nEven if Ibrahimovic is kept on the bench, St.Etienne could well have their hands full with either Marcus Rashford or Anthony Martial leading the line for United.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:32:41.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
