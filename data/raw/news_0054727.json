The developments are ordered from south to north. \nNote: Some other hot developments that have topped off already include Biscayne Beach in Edgewater in addition to SLS Lux and Brickell Heights in Brickell, and Prive in Aventura . 1 Park Grove \nLocated near the recently completed twisting towers of Grove at Grand Bay, the fellow Terra development in collaboration with Related is among the priciest under construction in South Florida, with units in the third tower (One Park Grove) starting at $4 million .
