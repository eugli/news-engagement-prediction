To celebrate the occasion, Colbert took aim at the president’s recent assertion that he wants to make the U.S. “top of the pack” when it comes to its nuclear arsenal. \n“Not sure if he means top dog or leader of the pack, but either way, he’s not the sharpest knife on the Christmas tree,” joked Colbert. \nThe host called this a “terrifying prospect,” quipping, “It’s like the Cold War all over again, but everyone’s on Russia’s side.” \nHaving taped the latest show on Thursday, Colbert didn’t have a chance on Friday’s episode to address Trump’s treatment of CNN and other media outlets earlier in the day, so the comedian shared his thoughts on Twitter, urging people to not be distracted by the situation and stay focused on Russia. Don’t (RUSSIA) let this (RUSSIA) press (RUSSIA) issue distract you (RUSSIA) from (oh my God RUSSIA) Trump’s ties to Russia.
