What is Maha Shivaratri and why is it celebrated? \nIn his first comments about the U.S. nuclear arsenal since his inauguration, Trump said the United States has ‘fallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity.’ \n‘I am the first one that would like to see everybody – nobody have nukes, but we’re never going to fall behind any country even if it’s a friendly country, we’re never going to fall behind on nuclear power. \n‘It would be wonderful, a dream would be that no country would have nukes, but if countries are going to have nukes, we’re going to be at the top of the pack.’ \nThe president said he believes the US has fallen behind in its atomic weapons capacity. (Picture: REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst) Trump also said China could ‘very easily’ solve the national security challenge posed by North Korea ‘if they want to’.
