Aberdeen, Wattisham in Suffolk and London could see the highest temperatures (Photo: Andrew Sharpe/Geoff Robinson Photography) \nThermometers will peak in southern and eastern England - while highs could peak at 17C in eastern Scotland, the Met Office said. \nAberdeen, Wattisham in Suffolk and London are all tipped as likely locations for the highest temperatures, with the east of the country broadly enjoying the best of the warmth. \nThe mild weather, which is pushing temperatures to 4C or 5C above the average maximums for this time of year, is being triggered by an air mass making its way over the Atlantic Ocean from Florida and parts of the Caribbean. (Photo: Met Office) \nThe rise could make parts of the UK among the hottest locations in Europe, following bouts of snow and freezing temperatures that took hold on the continent earlier this month. \nMet Office forecaster Marco Petagna said: \"The average maximums in the north are 6C or 7C for this time of year, but we are looking at 15C or 16C in a few spots.\" Read More \n\"But it will still be a bit short of the all-time record for February, which is 19.7C recorded on February 13 1998 in Greenwich, south-east London.\" Tropical air is moving in from the Americas (Photo: Alastair Grant) \nToday (Saturday) there will be a North-South weather split, with Scotland, Northern Ireland and north-east England quite cloudy and fairly windy, with some outbreaks of rain. \nBut the bulk of England and Wales will see a grey start with low cloud and fog patches give way to sunshine.
