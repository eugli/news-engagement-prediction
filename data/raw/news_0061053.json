Universal is being more cautious and suggesting high teens. Get Out , which premiered in a secret midnight screening at the Sundance Film Festival in January, is getting a berth in 2,777 theaters. \nPeele's film — boasting a rare 100 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes — hopes to steal the crown from holdover The Lego Batman Movie , which enters its third weekend. From Warner Bros., Lego Batman has earned north of $110 million domestically to date and $183 million worldwide. \nHollywood studios generally refrain from opening big event movies on Oscar weekend, and this year is no exception. The landscape changes dramatically on March 3 when X-Men spin-off Logan debuts, followed by Kong: Skull Island on March 10 and Beauty and the Beast on March 17. \nPeele also wrote the script for Get Out , about a young African-American man (Daniel Kaluuya) who is apprehensive about meeting the family of his white girlfriend (Allison Williams), since she hasn't told them he is black. When they arrive at her parents' home, he's further alarmed to learn that young black men have a habit of disappearing. \nJason Blum's Blumhouse produced Get Out alongside QC Entertainment's Sean McKittrick, Edward H. Hamm and Peele. The cast also includes Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford, Caleb Landry Jones and Stephen Root. \nGet Out opens in the glow of Universal and Blumhouse's hit horror-thriller, Split , from director M. Night Shyamalan. Split has grossed $196 million at the global box office since its Jan. 20 release. \nTwo other films open this weekend; animated family film Rock Dog and the long-delayed action film Collide , starring Nicholas Hoult, Felicity Jones, Marwan Kenzari, Ben Kingsley and Anthony Hopkins. \nA Chinese-American production , Rock Dog was fully financed and produced by Mandoo Pictures and the Huayi Brothers. Lionsgate Premiere acquired domestic rights to the film after tracking the movie for more than two years . Rock Dog , playing in roughly 2,000 theaters, is projected to open in the $4 million-$5 million range, and is counting on being a strong DVD player. \nThe story follows Bodi, a music-loving Tibetan Mastiff who embarks on an adventure to fulfill his dreams of becoming a musician. \nOpen Road and IM Global's Collide — a leftover title from Relativity Media — may only take in $3 million-$4 million from 2,045 theaters. The movie was originally set to open in October 2015. \nThere are no reviews yet for Collide and Rock Dog .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:23:52.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
