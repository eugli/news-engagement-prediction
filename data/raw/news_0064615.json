So after a few hours of wandering between displays, I began feeling overwhelmed. They ranged in size and approach, but the marketing language focused on “defense,” as if none of the weapons could be used to invade one’s neighbor, break up families or create refugees. Nowhere did I see images of blood, injuries or death. “It’s a very dangerous world and region, and there are things worth defending, and that requires some of this equipment,” Mr. Nurkin said. “But it can be a bit disconcerting for those who have never been to defense exhibitions to see them being traded like iPhones.” Photo Members of the Russian Presidential Regiment performing during a military show at the opening of IDEX.

Glock , the Austrian gun maker, had more than a dozen pistols out for visitors to cock, aim and take selfies with, making it one of the most visited stalls. \nAdvertisement “It’s because we have the best goodies,” a woman behind the counter explained before correcting herself. “The best products .” Many of the marketing slogans made sense only if you knew what the product did. “Sees with out being seen,” boasted an ad for a Czech-made radar system . “Your aim is our target,” promised a company displaying swiveling targets for marksmanship. “Nothing escapes you,” said an ad for an optics company that makes, among other things, rifle scopes. Sudan’s section featured a two-story fake stone castle surrounded by displays of rifles, rockets and a large, gray GPS-guided bomb. “It is a very accurate way to hit a target,” said Ibrahim Ismael Bashir, the sales and marketing director for Sudan’s Military Industry Corporation . In a small room nearby, I picked up a Sudanese machine gun simulator and blasted away at targets on a screen as martial ballads played in the background. One of the most photographed items was a gold-plated AK-47 displayed by Pakistan. Muhammad Iqbal, the technical manager for weapons at the Pakistan Ordnance Factories, said the rifle cost about $1,000 and was usually bought by collectors or presented to foreign dignitaries, especially from the Middle East. “They are very fond of this,” he said. But the show was not all about weapons. “Come on, I’ll show you the robot,” said Paul Bosscher, the chief engineer for robotic systems at Harris , of Melbourne, Fla., which focuses on communication technology. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story On display was the company’s new robot, T7 , which stands about six feet tall, moves about on treads and has a single arm with a big metal pincer on the end. Armored, covered with cameras and controlled remotely, it was designed to defuse bombs and, the company hopes, save lives — not just of civilians but also the soldiers and the police who have to cope with the explosives. As I gripped the controller and directed the robot to stack lengths of plastic pipe, a man posed next to it while his friend took a photo. “Who doesn’t want to get their photo with a robot?” Mr. Bosscher said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:58:43.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
