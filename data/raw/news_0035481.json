Rainbow Confectionery made those too. \nWhite said the company has just completed a major expansion project at the factory, which was timely given Cadbury's news. \nHe said once Cadbury leaves Dunedin, Rainbow Confectionery would be the largest provider of locally made sweets in the country and there were no plans for the company to go overseas. \nOther chocolate manufacturers still operating in New Zealand included Whittaker's and Donovans Chocolate. \n\"There's no real alternative for locally-made Easter eggs and Pineapple Lumps. We will just have to gear up for the expectation and uplift of sales,\" White said. \nHe also confirmed that the company would be looking at offering jobs to Cadbury staff. - Stuff ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:49:33.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
