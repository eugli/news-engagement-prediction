They were instead convicted of a lesser charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\nChan was also convicted of an additional charge of common assault.\nThe seven have been remanded.\n\nDozens of the policemen’s supporters watching a live broadcast in an adjacent courtroom clapped their hands in delight when they heard an interpreter say that the seven were acquitted of the first charge.\nBut their joy proved fleeting as they learned of the guilty verdicts on the second and third charges and they immediately lapsed into silence.\nJudge David Dufton’s verdict concludes one of the most controversial cases arising from the pro-democracy civil disobedience movement in 2014, when thousands took over major thoroughfares for up to 79 days following Beijing’s announcement of a restrictive political reform framework.\nOccupy activist Ken Tsang’s injuries ‘almost certainly’ inflicted by police baton, Hong Kong court told \nThe District Court previously heard Tsang, 41, testify that he had poured liquid onto officers on a clearance operation in Admiralty and was brought to a nearby substation by a group of officers after he was arrested and zip-tied.\nThe 224-page judgment found Tsang was carried to the substation where he was dumped on the ground and immediately assaulted, leaving him with injuries to his face, neck, shoulder, flank, chest and back.\nHowever, the court was not satisfied that these injuries amounted to grievous bodily harm.\nAs to the charge of common assault, Chan was convicted after the court accepted Tsang’s identification of the officer in a direct confrontation.\nThe activist had claimed that Chan slapped his face twice in the report room at Central Police Station.\nVideo may not show Ken Tsang being beaten, accused Hong Kong police officers claim \nAt issue was whether Tsang was assaulted by any or all of the seven officers.\nThe defence had countered that none of the accused were equipped with the specific baton that could have left certain bruises on the activist and argued that news footage could not be relied on for identification due to its poor quality.\nTsang was jailed for five weeks in a separate trial at Kowloon City Court last May over one count of assaulting police and two of resisting police.\nHe was immediately released on bail, pending an appeal against his conviction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:40:03.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
