Even though the occupation is imaginary, every other detail in the TV drama was meticulously researched over a three-year period. The London of SS-GB is one of smoggy, dirty streets, dimly lit pubs, and people wearing browns, greys, tweeds and heavy fabrics. Even the smallest item was painstakingly recreated, including identity passes and train tickets. Graffiti from the 1940s was also reproduced, with slogans such as ‘Wot no sugar?’ seen on walls. Executive producer Sally Woodward Gentle told The Mail on Sunday the production was ‘very sensitive’ because the team was conscious viewers might be distressed and uneasy about the depiction of a Nazi-occupied London. ‘We felt an enormous responsibility about it,’ she said. Detective Douglas Archer, who is forced to work under the brutal SS in occupied London, is played by Sam Riley ‘It is shocking but we have to remember that mainland Europe suffered. It’s absolutely terrifying and we were so incredibly lucky that we prevailed, and the whole production is in a way an honour for all those who served with the Allied forces.’ The drama stars Sam Riley – who played Joy Division star Ian Curtis in the 2007 biopic Control – as Detective Inspector Douglas Archer, and Kate Bosworth as US journalist Barbara Barga. Working on a routine murder case at SS-controlled Scotland Yard, Riley’s character soon becomes involved in espionage involving the British resistance movement, which attracts the interest of German authorities. SS-GB, widely expected to become the BBC’s new Sunday-night blockbuster, continues the trend for raunchier viewing. The series includes at least three sex scenes, including an opening sequence in which Riley’s naked mistress is draped in a swastika. Historian Max Arthur said: ‘There is no doubt the Germans spent a great deal of time planning how they would run the UK in the event of a successful invasion and our surrender. ‘In many ways, they were far more efficient planning for the post-occupation than the actual invasion across the Channel, which many of Hitler’s senior generals doubted would succeed. ‘Deighton’s fascinating book was one of the first so-called alternate histories where people imagine what if? ‘Thankfully, the RAF triumphed in the Battle of Britain and retained our air superiority. ‘Hitler turned his eyes from the UK and fatefully invaded Russia, so we will never know what might have happened if Hitler’s plan had succeeded.’ FAR FETCHED? TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF JERSEY Len Deighton, on whose 1978 novel the drama is based, used secret German plans as source material for his bestseller, left, while this famous photograph, right, shows a German soldier talking to a man dressed in the uniform of a British policeman on Jersey The Channel Islands were the only part of the British Isles to be occupied by Germany during the Second World War. Just 20 miles off the coast of France, the islands of Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and Herm provided a key strategic outpost for Germans when they invaded in the summer of 1940. The islands remained under Nazi rule – with German soldiers famously pictured parading outside a branch of Lloyds Bank in Guernsey and asking policemen for directions – until they were liberated in May 1945.
