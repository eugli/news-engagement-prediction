(Pic: Steve Tanner) DECIDING to start trying for kids is a massive decision which usually requires a fair bit of deliberation.\nIs the timing right? What impact will it have on my career? Am I/we in a position to be able to do this, both financially and emotionally?\nMy husband and I went through all of this last year when we decided we wanted to expand our little family.\nWe had long chats (usually over a bottle of the kind of pinot noir I’ve been craving ever since falling pregnant) about what we wanted our future to look like, and how we might juggle all of the moving pieces in our busy lives.\nAnd yet, at no point did the financial windfall of government benefits enter the equation.\nThis week Pauline Hanson came out against the federal government’s omnibus welfare bill, declaring it was problematic because the Coalition’s less-than-extravagant paid parental leave policy just encourages opportunistic women to breed.\n“They get themselves pregnant and (the government will) have the same problems they did with the baby bonus, with people just doing it for the money,’’ the One Nation leader told The Australian newspaper. “This is not commonsense ­policy,” she said.\n“I’ve gone through a bloody tough life myself as a single ­mother and held down a part-time job. I had no assistance, no help from anyone. But we have such a welfare handout mentality.”\nPauline Hanson, here with her children Adam and Lee, was a single mum who did it tough, but that doesn’t mean she’s right about government help for mothers. Firstly, I don’t for a second cast doubt how difficult it is for single parents to raise children and make ends meet.\nTrying to balance raising kids, with part time or full time jobs, soaring childcare bills, endless activities, and all without the emotional support of a partner can be real struggle. I am in awe of the men and women I see around me who are doing it.\nBut let’s get real here — having kids is a ridiculously large financial commitment.\nChildren are not cheap, and 18 or 20 weeks of parental leave, paid at the minimum wage, does not even come close to being a financially appealing prospect, when you weigh it up against all the baby-related expenses that pile up when you’re expecting.\nIf you’ve planned ahead and taken out private health insurance with obstetrics cover, you can expect to add to your already high monthly premiums thousands of dollars in extra out-of-pocket costs for scans, tests, specialists appointments and pregnancy management fees.\nThen there’s obviously the mountain of paraphernalia you need ahead of the arrival of your precious little baby; Moses baskets, cots, change tables, baby baths, slings, car capsules, breast pumps, drawers full of little onesies, nappies, and of course the pram, which can see you part with the kind of money you once-upon-a-time dreamt would buy you a designer handbag.\nFast-forward to the moment when you actually head off on maternity leave, and all of a sudden you are looking at living off a severely reduced income for somewhere between six months and a year, unfortunately without a corresponding reduction in your mortgage repayments, bills or general household expenses.\nCute, and very expensive. Government benefits don’t even come close to covering the cost of bringing up kids. (Pic: News Corp) So the $670 you pocket a week from the government over 18 weeks, while certainly welcome, is not exactly a delicious looking carrot that would entice many women to fall pregnant.\nThe payments, first of all, are contingent on women meeting a work test. So it is not, as Ms Hanson suggested, like the old-fashioned baby bonus that was provided to all new mums.\nIt is a targeted wage replacement scheme designed to make it easier for working mums to balance their careers with having a child.\nThe women who receive the government’s PPL scheme would otherwise be earning at least that amount of money over those 18 weeks if they didn’t opt to put their body and wallet through the wringer of pregnancy.\nWhat the government’s paid parental leave scheme does, and why it should be preserved, is that it provides new mums with the chance to spend extra time at home with their babies, bonding and breastfeeding if possible, without having to rush back to the office to ensure the household budget does not fall apart.\nIt also helps keep mums in the workforce longer term, assisting women in the early days as they juggle motherhood with their career trajectories, and helping companies retain skilled female employees.\nPaid parental leave is a social and economic policy, much more than a welfare payout. And it’s certainly not the cash bonanza Ms Hanson seems to think it is.\nOriginally published as No Pauline, we’re not having kids for the money", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ba275de37ad8512c72faa9976e046368?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/466d060195f52cac39e372494690635b?width=650", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/if-youre-having-kids-for-the-cash-youre-more-likely-to-go-broke-than-get-rich/news-story/94dd0743a7670eae59f6657d7ba22e35", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4ddaf7066d5952dca2e7f3fef6865679?width=316&api_key=qy2gvdw92m3b23ptgyv4995z"], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:58:50.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
