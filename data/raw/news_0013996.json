(Allison Devereaux/CBC)\nEach law school has been given one particular area of research to explore so there is no overlap.\n\"We're looking into different kind of legislative provisions, jurisdictional issues, jurisprudence and human rights law,\" said Guidone.\nShe said the summaries should be helpful to the Canadian Council for Refugees because of the Canada-U.S. Third Country Safety Agreement.\nThe act came into effect in 2004. According to a donation page the law students are using to raise money for the refugee council , the act prohibits asylum seekers from making refugee claims at the U.S.-Canada border. In other words, those who try to enter Canada through the U.S. are returned to the U.S. regardless of whether they qualify for asylum there because Canada considers the U.S. to be a safe country.\n\"It's problematic ... since people are being sent home, but then they can't then come and see if they can come into Canada [from the U.S.],\" said Guidone.\nEmily McCormick, 25, a first-year law student is just one of the many students that took part in today's research-a-thon. (Allison Devereaux/CBC)\nShe estimated about 50 people would drop in throughout the day. She said two alumni have also volunteered to help with the research from home and that faculty have been helping.\nAmong those helping with the research was Jessica Habet, an international student in her third year at the law school.\n\"Dal law has always been extremely supportive and an inclusive environment, so it wasn't surprising to see this kind of reaction,\" she said.\nThe group of law students will create summaries of relevant legal documents to help the Canadian Council for Refugees. (Allison Devereaux/CBC)\nOriginally from Belize, Habet said she has empathy for the people being denied entry into the U.S.\n\"I immediately knew it was wrong and against all human rights because it was arbitrary and discriminatory, so we knew we had to do something,\" said Habet.\n\"I think law is extremely powerful in these situations because we're dealing with an executive order and we're trying to show that the rule of law exists. There's due process for people.\"\nWith files from Allison Devereaux", "external_links": ["https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/canadian-law-student-research-a-thon-in-support-of/"], "published": "2017-02-05T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T05:15:52.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
