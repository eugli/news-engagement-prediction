He had been convicted three times in 2012 for breaches of domestic violence orders, only a year after their child was born. \nThose in Ms Brown's inner circle also knew Patea was a threat. In court, Ms Brown's mother Natalie Hinton labelled him a \"self-centred monster\" and a \"misogynistic narcissist\" who controlled Ms Brown and caused her to doubt herself. \nA week after the airport incident, Ms Brown successfully applied for a domestic violence protection order and moved into a refuge. Patea was able to track her down. \nThe court heard that on the day of the fatal attack, Patea rang up their daughter's day care centre to find out whether she was booked in, and then chased Ms Brown's car through the streets of the Gold Coast after the child had been dropped off. \nThey made it to Macquarie Avenue in Molendinar before he sent her car careering over a fence and into a ditch. \nHe initially walked away, but came back and continued the assault. He bludgeoned her with the hydrant cover while she was trapped in her vehicle, and shoved bystanders out of the way before stealing a ute and fleeing. \nPatea would emerge 30 minutes later with severe self-inflicted injuries, but said through his lawyers he had forgotten the entire episode. \nMs Brown clung to life for two more days before succumbing to her injuries. \n\"Somehow, her huge heart found the strength to grasp onto life for another 36 hours and she gave to us all time to say goodbye,\" Ms Hinton said in her victim impact statement.

(AAP: Dan Peled) \nOn Monday, Patea showed glimpses of emotion for the first time during the court process, having been steely-faced during previous hearings on the Gold Coast. \nThe one-time Bandido gang member wrote an apology note to Ms Brown's family, in which he declared: \"Tara was everything to me.\" \nBut Patea could barely bring himself to look at Ms Hinton or Leesa Kennedy — a Macquarie Avenue resident who rushed to Ms Brown's aid — when the pair spoke in the packed Supreme Court. \nAnd he stared straight ahead with no expression as Justice Debra Mullins sentenced him to life in jail for murder — a certain outcome under Queensland law. \nPatea has no hope of freedom until at least 2037, when the parole board could consider releasing him back into the community. \nMs Brown's supporters exchanged hugs outside the court at the conclusion of one of the state's most shocking domestic violence cases. \n\"We're very grateful for the sentencing today, a life sentence,\" Ms Hinton told reporters as she choked back tears. \n\"It doesn't bring back Tara though.\" \nMs Hinton urged women suffering at the hands of abusive partners to seek help. \n\"Remember Tara when you're seeking help. Remember the other woman. Don't become one of those women,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:02:21.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
