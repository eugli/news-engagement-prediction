Gupta missed it! \nOut of all this chaos, the Gnomes escaped with an essential 8.5-7.5 victory and will need to beat the Ljubljana Direwolves next week to make the playoffs. \nSt Louis Arch Bishops vs San Diego Surfers: \nThrough week five, Wesley So has been a prime candidate for league MVP. For two consecutive weeks, he scored 4-0 with very interesting games. In week six, he and his team faced the San Diego Surfers. \nThe Surfers were the only team with 5/5 entering week six. They have fielded one of the most balanced lineups each week as their board one, GM Alexey Dreev , has multiple times achieved 4/4 while their lower boards, IMs Michael Brown and Joshua Sheng, have been a real headache for even the very best players in the league. That proved true again this week as both Brown and Sheng had serious chances in very interesting games against So. \nThe Surfers kept up the pressure in round three as popular author, GM Melikset Khachiyan , played brilliantly against So and took his advantage into an endgame with an extra pawn. Opposite-color bishops kept the game holdable for So, and infiltration proved impossible for Khachiyan. \nSo won his final game against Dreev fairly convincingly, but it may have been the key victory from their board four, Nicholas Rosenthal, that put the Arch Bishops over the top to 8.5.The Surfers and the Arch Bishops are both part of the large 5-1 tie in the Pacific Division and must be considered to each have very good chances of a championship berth. \nMarseille Migraines vs Stockholm Snowballs: \nThe Snowballs have somewhat quietly accumulated the best record in their division with a very balanced lineup and generally excellent play from their board one, GM George Meier . This week the Marseille Migraines sat GM Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in favor of a more balanced lineup. This proved an effective strategy as they secured a clean 10-6 victory. GM Yannick Gozzoli achieved one of the more amusing wins as his fleeing king suddenly became an attacking one. \nLas Vegas Desert Rats vs San Jose Hackers : \nThe Hackers have won many fans in the PRO Chess League with their excellent streams featuring bubbly commentary from their bottom board NM Christopher Yoo . Unfortunately, their fan enthusiasm hasn't necessarily translated to match points. In the toughest division, they have had the toughest schedule. Entering the week, they were 3-2 while the Desert Rats were on a 50% score. \nGM Shakhriyar Mamedyarov was again excellent for the Hackers, scoring 3.5/4 and winning the below positional endgame, but the Hackers suffered on their lowest board as Ivan Ke scored 0-4. Meanwhile, the Desert Rats got 2.5/4 from FM Elliot Lu . That may have been the most notable statistic in a match that the Desert Rats won 8.5-7.5. \nGM Timur Gareyev has continually played some of the most interesting chess in the league. Here his rook goes wild on the fourth rank, eventually delivering a winning blow there. \nThese two teams will have a immediate rematch next week as they are two teams in the playoff hunt in the Pacific Division. It will be a winner take all rematch with the Desert Rats going through in the event of a tied match. The emotions may also have been elevated through a little chippiness demonstrated by the teams on Twitter. We are winning vs San Jose 7.5-4.5 but the score doesn't indicate how one sided this match has been thus far. #prochess @SanJoseHackers", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:17:02.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
