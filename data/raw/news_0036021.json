After Jim Jones got emotional during an interview with Funkmaster Flex about the rise and fall of Dipset and ending his beef with Jay Z by signing with Roc Nation, Cam’ron got on Instagram Live to break down his side of the story. \nFor those who don’t remember, Jones was the one who started the ByrdGang group back in 2006, but during his livestream, Cam went on record to say that he was the one who actually owns the rights to the name. “He said he ‘nah’ we Dipset, ByrdGang, that’s just our nickname. So what I did was,” Cam continues, “I’m just being totally honest, I copywrote the name ByrdGang. Because I’m like if you not trying to do nothing shiesty or try to separate yourself, it shouldn’t matter if I got it…if you want to branch off and do your own thing, that’s not a problem, but you told me you wasn’t. So I was like ‘I’ll put it to the side.'” \nFor some reason, Joe Budden decided to respond to Cam’s copyright claims on his self-titled Podcast saying, “when he said, ’You told me you wasn’t doin’ nothing with ByrdGang, so I copyrighted it,’ I would’ve f*cked him up, immediately!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:21:50.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
