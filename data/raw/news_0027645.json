The raids, targeting illegal immigrants with additional felonies, are part of the first large-scale enforcement operation since President Donald Trump took office. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officials said they targeted known criminals and arrested hundreds of illegal immigrants in what they called an “enforcement surge” that began Feb. 6 and took place in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago, New York, and the Carolinas. ICE arrested approximately 200 illegal aliens throughout Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina and arrested 160 more in 55 communities throughout southern California. \nOf the 160 arrested in California, approximately 150 were marked by misdemeanors or “felony criminal histories ranging from child sex crimes to weapons charges to assaults,” according to the Los Angeles Daily News. \n“Dangerous criminals who should be swiftly deported are being released in our community,” said David Marin, field office director for ICE, according to the Daily News. “This operation is on par with similar operations. We do this two or three times a year.” \nOf the illegal aliens arrested in the Los Angeles area, one was an MS-13 gang member from El Salvador who had been arrested previously in his native country for aggravated extortion, one was a Brazilian wanted for cocaine trafficking, and another was an Australian who had been convicted for carrying out “lewd and lascivious” acts with a child.
