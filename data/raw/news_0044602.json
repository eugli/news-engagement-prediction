Reliance Jio just passed the 100 million subscribers mark within six months of launching the service on September 1 last year. \nAFP \nThe signs were there, Jio users were always rising in number. After crossing the 50 million subscriber mark in just 80 days , and 72 million user mark in just under four months, the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio 4G VoLTE service was going full steam ahead for the 100 million mark. Yet, noone expected it to cross it in record time, just under 180 days. Reliance Jio has also managed to take the telecom market by storm, making a major dent in the fortunes of India’s biggest telecom player -- Bharti Airtel , which recently reported its lowest profit in four years. \nWill Mukesh Ambani extend free Reliance Jio party till end of June 2017? \nMukesh Ambani is expected to make an announcement later today to confirm the 100 million subscriber mark. There’s also speculation that the Happy New Year offer which gives Jio subscribers free data till the end of March 2017 will be extended till June 2017 at a fixed nominal price \nInputs from TOI Don't Miss ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:36:27.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
