By Hayley MacMillen Twin Falls County Jail Advertisement - Continue Reading Below A 19-year-old Idaho man convicted of raping a 14-year-old girl has been ordered by a judge to complete a year-long therapeutic program rather than go to prison — as well as to not have sex until marriage. According to the Times-News of Twin Falls, Idaho, Judge Randy Stoker told the rapist, Cody Duane Scott Herrera, that if he completes the program and is placed on probation, \"a condition of that will be you will not have sexual relations with anyone except who you’re married to, if you’re married.\" (If Herrera does not complete the program, the judge can then choose to send him to jail .) Stoker said that he made his decision based on Herrera's admission that he has had sex with 34 people: “I have never seen that level of sexual activity by a 19-year-old,” the judge said. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare has not designated Herrera as a sexual predator, despite the fact that he pled guilty to sneaking into the room of a 14-year-old girl he knew in 2015, removing her clothes as she asked him to stop , and raping her while she cried. \"It was his intent from the beginning to take what he wanted from my 14-year-old child — her virginity,\" the victim’s mother said in a court statement. \"And he stayed around until he got it from her. Cody will never understand what he has done to our family.\" Stoker's unusual sentencing relies on an old Idaho law about \"fornication\" that forbids \"any unmarried person\" from having \"sexual intercourse with an unmarried person of the opposite sex.\" According to Shaakirrah R. Sanders, a University of Idaho College of Law associate professor, this law, which was added in 1972, probably wouldn't stand up to modern legal scrutiny: \"I think if he appealed, he would win,\" she told the Times-News . This judge's celibacy order is almost as nonsensical as failing to sentence a man who raped a girl to any prison time, or to register him as a sex offender. It's not sex outside of marriage that's the problem here — it's sex that was forced on a minor, a.k.a. child rape, which you'd think judges would seek to prevent by putting perpetrators behind bars.
