In an operation named 'Backpacker', the Dubai Police arrested a GCC national who was visiting the UAE for possession of narcotic substances and the promotion and abuse of drugs. Over 202kg of narcotic substances were retrieved from him, the police said. The Dubai Police's Anti-Narcotics Department received information about the suspect's drug-related activity on January 30. Major-General Khalil Ibrahim Al Mansouri, Assistant Commander-in-Chief for Criminal Investigation at the Dubai Police, said the force planned to arrest the suspect after investigating the lead, carrying out an ambush to trap him while he was on his way to the airport to leave the country. Colonel Eid Mohammed Thani Hareb, Director of the General Department of Anti-Narcotics, added that the operation was named Backpacker due to the mobility of the accused. A breakthrough came after the police found a villa in Ajman, where the man had stored large quantities of narcotic pills. The police raided the house when the suspect was about to leave for the airport. He was stopped by the police and then taken into custody. The 37-year-old suspect had stored drugs in the villa several times. Narcotic pills were also found in secret caches in the man's car. On raiding the villa, the police found four suitcases and plastic bags inside a room, containing more than 202 kg of Captagon pills. - amira@khaleejtimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T20:18:03.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
