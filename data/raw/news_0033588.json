A 20-year veteran of the hospitality trade, Knapp was most recently executive chef at The Driskill Hotel in Austin, a position he held since 2013. “I appreciate that the kitchen is a place of rich culture and diversity, with people of all walks of life,” Knapp said in a press release. Brad Deboy, chef de cuisine at Blue Duck Tavern since late 2014, will continue to lead that dining program. Blue Duck Tavern was awarded a Michelin star last fall during D.C.’s debut in the international guidebooks. Knapp succeeds Franck Loquet, who was named executive chef of the hotel in October 2015. Knapp’s appointment comes just weeks after Blue Duck Tavern brought on board DBGB alum Erin Reed as pastry chef.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:15:30.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
