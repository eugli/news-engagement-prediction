With her golden locks swept back in a sleek ponytail, Gigi, as Chef Hadid, told viewers: 'Most people mix all the ingredients together at once, but the correct way to do it is to mix the milk and egg mixtures first.' Wearing a striped pink cropped sweater with high-waisted blue jeans, Gigi smiled as she said: 'I'm gonna try and do it with one hand like they do on Food Network.' As Chef Hadid instructed her to add other ingredients - namely oil and salt - Gigi was seen going decidedly heavy-handed. She also spoke about her biggest fear, admitting that it would be 'for me to be like, \"What should I cook today? I can make anything.\" And then they tell me what to cook and then I screw it up. So failure.' Snuggled up: The loved-up model recently shared a shot of the couple enjoying a snuggle The older sister of fellow model Bella Hadid also admitted that she once had a strange habit: 'I used to eat salt out of the palm of my hand as a kid.' As the clip came to a close, Gigi poured out the lumpy-textured mixture, before pouring it into a tray and closing the oven. She then showed off some goofy dance moves, prompting Chef Hadid to boom: 'We don't dance in my kitchen. This is work! Would I dance on your set? I don't think so!' As the oven pinged, indicating that the Yorkshire puddings were ready, Chef Hadid turned to the camera with the disclaimer: 'I'd just like to note that I haven't touched these.' So in love: The couple got together months after Zayn ended his engagement to Perrie Edwards in August 2015 However, as Gigi excitedly yelled, 'they're kind of amazing,' while holding the golden baked goods, Chef Hadid closed out the clip by saying: 'That's because you have an amazing teacher!' In March's issue of British Vogue, Gigi - who serves as the glossy fashion publication's cover girl - opened up about her relationship with Zayn, which begun months after he ended his engagement to Perrie Edwards.

In the interview, Gigi also revealed what a typical night between her and the Pillowtalk heartthrob looks like. 'We like late-night movies and we order from this amazing place that does lattes and gingerbread cookies. I need coffee to stay up. 'I'm always like, \"Babe, let's go to a movie.\" Then I fall asleep halfway through and he's like, \"You've seen the first half of every movie out there and you have no idea how any of them end.\"' The March issue of British Vogue is on sale now.
