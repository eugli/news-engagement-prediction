Thu Feb 23 2017 11:38:08   11:38:08 GMT+0000 (GMT) Josh Lawless Josh Lawless in football \nSome new images of what could well be Arsenal's kits for the 2017/18 season have emerged online. \nIn some instances, 'leaked' kits don't turn out to be the actual kits for the next season but both Footy Headlines and ArsenalFanTV (taking a break from their famous fan-cams)appear to have got their hands on some images of what Arsenal's kits are likely to look like next season - irrespective of whether Arsene Wenger is in charge or not. \nFooty Headlines have published several images of Arsenal's 2017/18 home kit and in all fairness, it's not too different to the shirt Gunners players have been wearing for the current campaign. \nPuma are once again the kit makers, Fly Emirates remain sponsors and the design is predominantly red with a white trim - as has been the case for Arsenal for the past 10 years. \nThe major difference is the collar on the shirt. \nHere are the images: \nArsenalFanTV released images of the same shirt in what looks like a club shop setting, but it also contains two other kits. \nThe first, presumably, the club's away kit, is a teal, turquoise colour with hints of royal blue. The final kit we see in the image, which looks like the goalkeepers kit - is a mixture of black and pink. The club's crest, Puma logo and Fly Emirates are all in luminous pink, as is the collar on the shirt. \nCourtesy of Footy Headlines, you can get a closer look at the rumoured away kit here: \nArsenal fans, would you be with having these designs as your kits next season? \nLet us know your thoughts in the comments. \nBefore you go, check out the top 10 worst football shirts in history: Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:34:51.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
