Bernie Sanders experienced a \"technical issue\" during a Friday interview on CNN after he made a joke that the news network was \"fake news.\"\nAppearing on \"Outfront,\" the senator was asked to discuss reports that President Trump 's national security adviser, Mike Flynn, had discussed sanctions on Russia with the country's ambassador the day before they were implemented by the Obama administration.\n\"This is a very troubling development,\" the senator said, adding that it \"speaks to the broader issue of Russia's involvement in our elections\" and \"to the issue of President Trump being buddy-buddy\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he called \"a thug and a murderer.\"\nCNN's Erin Burnett showed him a clip showing Trump saying he hasn't heard anything about new reports Friday contradicting Flynn's assertion that he did not speak with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions in December.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\n  Washington Examiner News Alerts.   alert soon!

I'm saying you don't buy what he said obviously\" — but the senator did not appear to hear what she said.\n\"Erin?\" Sanders asked. \"Are we on?\"\nAfter a few moments and no resolution CNN cut to a commercial break. When the show returned, the connection with Sanders was re-established and Burnett apologized for the \"technical issue\" before moving on with the interview.\nTrump has repeatedly criticized CNN, among other news outlets, for being \"fake news.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump's nominee to be Israel ambassador gets a hearing date David Friedman could help lead many changes for U.S. policy toward Israel.\nBy Al Weaver • 02/11/17 3:35 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:19:36.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
