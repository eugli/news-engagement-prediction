Trevor Paddenburg PerthNow Share on Twitter \nJOBSEEKERS wanted — but bogans need not apply. \nA Perth small business has ignited debate about workplace discrimination by advertising an administration role but stipulating “no bogans need apply”. \n“We are seeking an international student for admin and driving role for family business,” read the advertisement, which was live this week on the jobs section of buy and sell website Gumtree. \n“12-15 hours per week and must be a computer whizz with full driver’s licence. Must have good references. Drug free, also child and pet friendly. No bogans or rough people need apply,” continued the advertisement, posted by “Caz” from Morley. \nLynn and Brown Lawyers associate Kate Bretherton, who practises in employment law, said workplace anti-discrimination laws extended to job advertisements and, while the bogan reference was unlikely to be a breach of the laws, she said it was “not advisable”. \n“A statement that ‘bogans need not apply’ may not be contrary to anti-discrimination law, but those involved in the hiring of candidates should explain the genuine requirements of the position,” Ms Bretherton said. \n“The bogan description is often associated with unsophisticated people of low social status, and the use of the word in an advertisement for a job may imply a focus or interest in the socio-economic background of the candidate, which, while not unlawful, should be avoided.” \nThe Morley business owner who posted the Gumtree ad did not reply to emails this week, but WA Equal Opportunity Commission acting commissioner John Byrne said while the bogan reference did not breach the Equal Opportunity Act, stipulating that an international student was wanted could be a breach. \n“Presumably, this employer would reject an application from a student who was not an international student, but if the employer’s decision was based on the race of the applicant, including the person’s ethnic or national origin, it might be unlawful,” Mr Byrne said. \nThe commission received 290 workplace discrimination complaints last financial year, which made up 66 per cent of all complaints, slightly up on the 59 per cent of complaints in 2014-15 and 63 per cent of complaints in 2013-14. \nThe Gumtree advertisement is not the first time a bogan reference in a job ad has caused a stir. In April last year an ad called for “applicants who possess the qualities to be a professional bogan”. \nThat ad, which appeared on seek.com.au under the arts, media and performing arts section, was posted by promoters The Gelo Company for “bogan bingo” nights at Perth pub Rosie O’Grady’s. \nThe person applying for the role had to be “fully sick”, able to count to 90 and understand the risks of running in thongs, while desirable traits included a love of Emu Export beer and knowing the lyrics to rock band AC/DC’s hit Thunderstruck . \nThe bogan phenomena has also been embraced by fans of Perth man Ethan Marrell who has 5.4 million followers of his online persona “Ozzy Man”, a parody of a dinky-di bogan who has a good heart despite his fondness for foul language.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T09:56:01.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
