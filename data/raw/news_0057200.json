If you only assume it is the individual's responsibility to protect themselves and to behave differently, to not lead with their head, then it was easy for the workplace, the NFL or CFL, to take no responsibility.\"\nHe said it was only after the issue was repeatedly brought to light that the leagues started making top down changes â€” like the type of equipment used and the rules around hitting.\n\"When we don't understand things, we tend to leave them alone or we're afraid of them,\" he said. \"It's about bringing it out into the open.\"\nWith files from The Early Edition", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:53:15.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
