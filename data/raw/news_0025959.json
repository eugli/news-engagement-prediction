It's part of a dispute more than a year old.\nThe trip was scheduled for January, but had to be cancelled. MacDougall says the teacher has been “incredibly dedicated” and has supported students throughout the job action.\n“The issue is mainly, for me, the decisions taken by the NSTU,” she says. “I think that the inconsistency that they’ve shown in not allowing the kid’s trips to go forward … has been incredibly problematic.”\nMacDougall says there are long-term implications of students not having the opportunity to experience these types of trips.\n“I think that (the NSTU) needs to be aware that their strike action, essentially, has impacted 40 kids,” she says.\nMacDougall says the job action has also impacted her child’s university application to an out-of-province university.\n“Carlton doesn’t really care that the teachers in Nova Scotia are on work-to rule,” she says. “They have entrance scholarships that require reference letters, so that’s been an issue for lots of the kids in Grade 12.”\nThe teachers are scheduled to vote on the latest tentative on Wednesday, but if schools are to closed due to inclement weather, that process could be delayed.\n  Sarah Ritchie. \nRelated Stories Basketball Cape Breton organizes juvenile league after work-to-rule puts season on hold Halifax student claims work-to-rule job action is resulting in more bullying Parents hold rally for teachers ahead of vote on tentative agreement Photos Gail MacDougall is calling for compensation from the Nova Scotia Teacher Union after students missed a trip to Harvard University due to their job action.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:28:27.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
