The man snared 6 wickets as India collapsed from 94/3 to 105 all out. \nIt was a massive batting collapse and means that the Aussies lead by 155 runs. They will look to drive home the advantage and set Virat Kohli's boys a stiff target on a pitch that is certainly not proving to be batsman friendly.
