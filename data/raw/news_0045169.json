Notably, Diamond and Silk, sisters who stumped for Trump via YouTube, had the crowd chanting “CNN sucks” before it was even 5 p.m. (the rally’s scheduled start time). \nBy the end of the evening, supporters approached the media pen , chanting “CNN sucks” and “tell the truth!” \n“What you hear about chaos, I think that’s really overblown,” said Philip Wahlbom, 48, of Atlanta, GA when asked what he thought about the beginning of the administration. “You have these reporters that want to highlight the things that maybe aren’t going quite as [smoothly] as you would like them to, but by and large I think it’s going just fine… he’s shaking things up, he’s stirring the pot, he’s kicking the hornet’s nest, I think he’s doing a great job.” \nSome of Trump’s supporters told BuzzFeed News that their media consumption habits changed during the campaign. And when asked what they thought of Trump’s remarks on the media tonight, many said they thought Trump was spot on. \n“I was an avid CNN person. But even during the campaign… you could see which way they were swaying, OK? I mean, it didn’t take a rocket scientist to see they were against him,” said Darlene Morris, 61, of Palm Bay, FL. “And if I’m just a normal person and I could tell that, I’m sure [Trump] knows it.” \n“Now I don’t watch but our Channel 13 news.” \nThe president has established a direct line of communication to his supporters, at times circumventing the press by using Twitter to connect directly to them. \nSome said they became more engaged with news and politics when Trump began running for office. Jeinne Eubanks, 56, of Summerfield, FL told BuzzFeed News she did not follow politics at all until she heard Trump was running. \n“When my mom told me he was running, I’d never even watched news because I was always just so fed up with everything,” Eubanks said. “I started paying attention, and I have just loved that man, would take a bullet for him, since day one.” \nWhen asked where she gets her news, Eubanks said she TiVo’s Fox News. \n“If I told you you did a sorry job …every day, every day, every minute of the day, how long would it be before you would get disheartened?” Asked Richard Rowell, 74, of Waycross, GA. Rowell said that while he still watches a little bit of MSNBC, he stopped watching it regularly because he felt its reports were “negative.” \nWhen asked about what political issues supporters wanted the president to address at the rally, many listed the “liberal media.” \nOne supporter told BuzzFeed News that she was turned off by a changed media landscape. “Our local paper fell apart,” she said, and too many outlets rush to be first. Now, she said , she watches Right Side Broadcasting — a mostly YouTube channel that gained prominence by streaming every Trump campaign rally — and “watched MSNBC [on election night] because I wanted to see them whine.” \nAnother supporter told BuzzFeed News he either gets his news from C-SPAN — which mostly airs the workings of government without commentary — and the Kremlin-backed Russia Today , now known as RT. \nOther supporters said they got their news from Facebook — recently embroiled in a controversy over promoting fake news — the National Enquirer, and Dennis Michael Lynch , who openly promotes news favorable to Trump. \nMany others had complaints about “fake news.” The phrase was a big topic of conversation among supporters as they waited for the president. \nWhen asked what news he trusts to stay informed, one supporter answered that the president was the answer. \n“We can trust Donald.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T10:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:09:52.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
