Georgea Kovanis , On Style 11:02 p.m. ET Feb. 19, 2017 Friends (Photo: Rob Smoak, KRT) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAfter an incredibly long week, it was finally Friday, and I really, really wanted to go somewhere to celebrate — until I realized I had no one to go with; my friends were either out of town, at work, or otherwise occupied. \nSo I got carryout, went home, watched TV with my cat — seriously — and, of course, felt sorry for myself: Where have all my girlfriends gone? Why have they left me behind? \nIt turns out, I'm not alone in feeling so alone. \n\"A lot of people have that feeling,\" says Irene S. Levine, a psychologist who writes about friendships at www.thefriendshipblog.com and is the author of \"Best Friends Forever: Surviving a Breakup with Your Best Friend\" (Overlook Press, $16.95). \"They feel humiliated and ashamed that they have no friends, so people don’t talk about it — I’m not saying, literally no friends, (but) people often have that feeling.\" \nRead more: Feeling blue? 10 ways to lift your spirits in a snap \nSays Shasta Nelson, founder of GirlFriendCircles.com , a women’s friendship matching site in 65 cities across the U.S. and Canada, and author of \"Frientimacy: How to Deepen Friendships for Lifelong Health and Happiness\" (Seal Press, $14): \"I believe we have an epidemic of unacknowledged loneliness.\" \nEspecially, it seems, among women. It's like a dance \nFriendships between women are complex. Whereas men are often content to play sports together or go out for beers, women tend to want deeper friendships. We want to be Mary and Rhoda. Or, maybe, Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda. \"We want someone who understands us, women really want to have intense kinds of relationships with each other,'' says Levine. \nBut finding candidates for those kinds of friendships can be difficult — especially as we get older. \"In college, everybody’s doing the same thing at the same time. It’s much easier,\" says Levine. But as we age, our interests and experiences become more diverse. Some people get married, others don't. Some people have kids, others are childless. Some leave town, others stay put. Some get promoted at work or change jobs or work situations. \nAnd all that creates distance, which creates loneliness. \n“When I worked in an office, I wasn't actively trying to search for friends because I had that pool of acquaintances and friends through the office,'' says Lynne Schmidt, who is 37 and now works out of her home in Royal Oak. “I don’t have the advantage of going into an office and talking to people every day. ... I have a handful of very close core friends and several acquaintances. But most of my relationships are with out-of-towners.\" \nAnd even though she's joined a local book club, Schmidt says, “the whole making friends thing, let's just call that a work-in-progress.\" \nFriendships don't happen overnight, usually. \"For two people to develop a true friendship, each one has to kind of reveal, very slowly, a little part of themselves and get the other person to trust them. It's almost like a dance that goes back and forth,\" says Levine. \nAdds Nelson: \"We want our new friends to act like best friends, we need to recognize that it takes time.\" \nAnd women — between work, kids, shouldering the bulk of the chores at home — tend not to have a great deal of time. Fear of rejection \nIt's true, my friends have full lives, their schedules fill up quickly. \nIt's also true, that I've ended some friendships and probably squandered some others and that I haven't been especially proactive in finding new people. \"Your need for friends kind of changes over time,'' Levine said. \"It's not one constant craving, sometimes you’re busier with responsibilities for work, with family members, with care-giving. In the winter, you might be more content to hunker down.\" \nBut it occurs to me that putting myself out there only to be rejected is what prevents me — and a great number of people — from being more aggressive in meeting potential new friends. After all, it's one thing to be home alone on a Friday night because you haven't worked especially hard at making new friends. It's another thing altogether to be at home alone despite working hard at making new friends. \nI'm not certain what the answer to all of this might be, though sometimes it seems like it'd be so much easier to go back to when we were younger, when all it took to be friends was to walk up to someone on the playground and ask.
