(PTI) UP polls 2017: In its reaction to PM Narendra Modi ’s speech at Fatehpur rally today, Congress party came out strongly in protest against PM looking to create a divide in society. In his address to a huge gathering, PM Modi tore into the UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav ’s government for failing to maintain law and order in the state. PM started his speech by saying, “Sabka saath, sabka vikas is our mantra”. But more than that, PM Modi accused CM Yadav of playing vote bank politics and taking it to extremes by saying “When electricity is available on Ramzan, then so should its supply be ensured during Diwali.” (“Ramzan me bijli aati hai tho Diwali me bhi aani chahiye; Bhedbhav nahi hona chahiye). PM Modi added, “there shouldn’t be any discrimination.” For those who may have missed the phrase, PM Modi underlined his message by saying “If there is a Kabaristaan, there should be Shamshaan too”. PM said it was because of poolicies like this that will cost Akhilesh Yadav his chiefministership and also indicated that the UP CM already knew of his fate in the elections as “The glow has disappeared from Akhilesh Yadav’s face, his voice has become feeble. SP chief has accepted that he has lost the game”.\nThe words led Congress to react strongly to indicate that this kind of language should not be used to split the population. Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said, “He must not give such wrong and irresponsible statements (kabaristan and electricity remarks).” Wanting the matter not to end here, Sharma said that “the EC should take note of PM’s statement, this is a clear violation of their directions.”\nYou May Also Like To Watch This:\nAnother senior Congressman to react to PM Modi’s statement was Randeep Singh Surjewala. He said that statements like these will lead to the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) losing massively during the ongoing elections to the legislative assemblies. Surjewalla said, “BJP will lose Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Manipur and will not open their account in Punjab.” Surjewala added, “In UP, the third decisive phase of election has conclusively established that SP-Congress alliance is winning decisively”\nPM not just highlighted the divide in UP, he also made some strong comments about the alliance between Congress and the Samajwadi Party. He said, “Supreme Court had to intervene to ask UP police to lodge FIR against Gayatri Prajapati who was allegedly involved in rape and murder.” He reminded the gathering that\nAkhilesh Yadav started his campaigning in UP with Prajapati and asked ‘UP wants to know, is the SP-Congress alliance pious like Prajapati?’ (“Akhileshji ne chunav abhiyan Prajapati k chunav prachar se shuru kiya; UPjana chahti hai kya SP-Cong alliance Prajapati jitna pavitra hai?”)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:04:08.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
