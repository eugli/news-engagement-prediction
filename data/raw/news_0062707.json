And though there's been no definitive evidence of a conspiracy between Trump and Russia , we do have a shit ton of circumstantial evidence. You know, like the campaign being in constant communication with Russian intelligence officers. And you know what they say: \"Where there's smoke, there's the burning ruins of a once great democracy.\" EDITOR’S PICK Michael Flynn’s Resignation Is the Scariest Evidence Yet of Russia’s Influence in the Trump Administration \nToday, we get more circumstantial evidence as Politico reports that a Ukranian parliamentarian named Serhiy Leshchenko attempted to blackmail Paul Manafort with damning information about both he and the man whose presidential campaign he was then running, Donald Trump. \nThe undated communications, which are allegedly from the iPhone of Manafort’s daughter, include a text that appears to come from a Ukrainian parliamentarian named Serhiy Leshchenko, seeking to reach her father, in which he claims to have politically damaging information about both Manafort and Trump. \nAttached to the text is a note to Paul Manafort referring to “bulletproof” evidence related to Manafort’s financial arrangement with Ukraine’s former president, the pro-Russian strongman Viktor Yanukovych, as well as an alleged 2012 meeting between Trump and a close Yanukovych associate named Serhiy Tulub. \n“Considering all the facts and evidence that are in my possession, and before possible decision whether to pass this to [the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine] or FBI I would like to get your opinion on this and maybe your way to work things out that will persuade me to do otherwise,” reads the note. It is signed “Sergii”— an alternative transliteration of Leshchenko’s given name — and it urges Manafort to respond to an email address that reporters have used to reach Leshchenko. \nNow, do we know for sure that this is legitimate? No. But we do know that Manafort was one of the campaign aides that was in contact with Russian Intelligence throughout the campaign . We do know that certain aspects of that damning dossier on Trump have been confirmed . We do know that Michael Flynn was in secret contact with Russia , promising to ease sanctions even before the Trump's inauguration. \nAnd finally, we do know that Trump speaks of Russia with a shocking and almost inexplicable positivity that is truly remarkable, considering the Obama administration was lambasted by Republicans for even trying to reset diplomatic relations with the country. It's not like Obama was coming out and saying how Putin is a great man, he literally was just like, \"Hey, maybe we should try some diplomacy?\" and the right lost their damn minds. This is all to say that there needs to be a Congressional investigation into Russia's hacking into our election and the Trump team's ties to Putin, so if Jason Chaffetz can stop falsely claiming that his town halls are over run with paid protesters, and start doing his job, that would be great.
