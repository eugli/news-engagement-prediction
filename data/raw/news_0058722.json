In the argument over transgender bathroom access, that put her at a disadvantage against Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator with decades of Washington experience and connections who has long had Mr. Trump’s ear. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But critics and admirers alike say they expect her to learn the ropes, build ties and get her way. “There is a real tendency to underestimate her,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, usually a stalwart supporter of Democrats. “She comes across as personable, plain-spoken, but she is dangerous.” Ms. DeVos, 59, grew up in Holland, Mich., in the western part of the state. She worked at times at the auto parts company her father, Edgar Prince, a major backer of Christian conservative causes, founded and built into a billion-dollar business. Her brother, Erik D. Prince, founded and was chief executive of the private security firm Blackwater, a controversial contractor for American personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. Her husband, Dick DeVos, comes from an even wealthier family — his father was a founder of Amway, the multilevel marketing company — and he ran unsuccessfully for governor of Michigan in 2006. Opponents have noted Ms. DeVos’s lack of connections to public schools and colleges — she and her husband had private educations, as did their children — or to the problems average families have in paying for education. For three decades, Ms. DeVos fought to steer tax dollars away from traditional public schools to charter schools, which rely on public money but are operated by private groups, outside public school structures. She also sought public funds for vouchers to pay for tuition at private schools, including religious schools. Opponents call charter schools a conservative plan to undermine public education by starving it of resources, while supporters argue that they give poor families choices and create competition that pressures traditional schools to improve. But Ms. DeVos has taken the cause further than many charter school advocates. She has supported schools run by for-profit companies and opposed performance standards for them. She has also argued that the free market — parents’ deciding whether to send their children to charter schools — should decide their fate. Largely because of her efforts, Detroit has the nation’s largest concentration of charter schools. Many of them are low-performing, and the supply exceeds the demand in some places, within a system that has little oversight and has been derided as chaotic . At the same time, Detroit’s public schools, among the worst in the nation, have continued to deteriorate. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
