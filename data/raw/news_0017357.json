Bella quickly took the video down, but not before it popped up elsewhere.\nNow Zayn has rushed to his lady's defense — but not everyone is convinced by his argument.\nScroll down for video\nThat's my girl! Zayn Malik came out in defense of his girlfriend Gigi Hadid today\nHe assured fans that she 'likes Asian's after people accused her of being racist\nUh-oh: A video showing Gigi imitating the narrow eyes of the Buddha (in cookie form) angered fans\nDon't do that, girl... In the short clip, Gigi holds the cookie up to her face and then smiles and squints her eyes\nGuilty conscience? Bella Hadid, Gigi's sister, shared the video but quickly took it down when people got angry\nThe very short clips features Gigi and friends at a restaurant, where several are singing Happy Birthday. Gigi holds up a cookie in the shape of the Buddah, then smiles and squints her eyes to imitate his face.\n'This is y'all woke palestine queen? Gigi out here mocking Asian people. i would say she's cancelled but she never started [sic],' wrote one poster.\nOther people shared similar comments, with one saying: 'smh she's been cancelled. She's made fun of Asian people, and done so many racist things but nobody pays attention.'\nOne person even tweeted directly at Zayn, writing: 'Being of Asian descent, how do you feel about your girlfriend making fun of Asian people?'\nZayn responded minutes later, assuring him, 'trust me.. she likes asians [sic],' and adding a winking smiley face.\nSome pointed out that this wasn't the first time that the model has been embroiled in a scandal about racial insensitivity\nIn agreement: In one poll on Facebook, over 50,000 fans called the squinting 'racist AF'\nNot such a great point: Several pointed out that Gigi is dating an Asian man (Zayn Malik), though Gigi is also half Middle Eastern\nMany have expressed anger and exasperation at her actions\nResponding: Fans and non-fans alike have been unhappy with the clip\nZayn's father is British Pakistani, meaning he is of Asian descent. Gigi's father — Palestinian-American developed Mohammad Hadid — is also Middle Eastern.\nDespite his protests, though, fans didn't seem swayed. One wrote along Twitter rant accusing Zayn of being ignorant as well.\n'You seriously need to educate yourself for the sake of your career and your social standing. You can't get away with this s***,' she wrote. 'I'm telling you this for your own sake bc it's 2017 and a time of peril for a lot of people and you can't afford to be ignorant.\n'It is the least of your obligations as a MUSLIM to be educated and socially aware so it's about time you take that role Zayn.'\nAs some have said, it doesn't matter if the intention to be racist isn't there — the ignorance that something is racist can alone be part of a racist act.\nGoing back: Fans were similarly upset with this cover of Vogue Italia, in which Gigi sported an Afro\nThere were also cries of cultural appropriation when she wore dreadlocks during a Marc Jacobs runway show last year, though all the models wore them\nIn 2015, she braced herself for backlash when she shared this picture of henna tattoos\nShe pointed out that she was appropriating a culture because it is actually her culture — she is half Palestinian\nThe claims of past 'racist' behavior seem to be referring to the time Gigi was accused of cultural appropriation while modeling.\nIn 2016, she wore colorful dreadlocks to walk in Marc Jacobs' runway show — a choice that was not hers, but the designers. She also once modeled a blue Afro on the cover of Vogue Italia.\nIn 2015, Instagram followers were also quick to attack her for showing off henna tattoos on her hands, to which she had a speedy response:\n'Before you go all \"cultural appropriation\" in my comments, check out the last name. Hadid. Half Palestinian & proud of it,' she wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T09:19:34.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
