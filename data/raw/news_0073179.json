Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLily Allen has revealed that she is bipolar and also suffered post traumatic stress disorder after the loss of her baby son. \nThe singer made the revelation during a Twitter exchange about the treatment of pensioners. \nWhen told by another user he felt she had mental health illness, she replied: ‘I DO have mental health issues. Bi-polar, postnatal depression, and PTSD, does that make my opinion void?’ \nShe later explained to her 5.9million followers that her PTSD occurred after her son was stillborn in 2010, six months into her pregnancy. \nShe described the ordeal for the first time yesterday, in graphic detail, saying: ‘I lay in a hospital bed with my deceased son stuck between my legs halfway out of my body for ten hours.’ \nLily, 31, is well known for her wild behaviour – often appearing to be drunk in public and making outrageous political comments. \nSufferers of bipolar disorder experience extreme mood swings which can last for months. \nLily has previously criticised the lack of funding in NHS mental healthcare. \nThe singer has also spoken about her postnatal depression following the births of her two young daughters, Ethel, five, and Marnie, four.
