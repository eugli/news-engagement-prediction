The mother and son were the only two working at the sandwich chain at the time of the robbery, police said. Both Javier and his mother were the only two employees working in the restaurant (pictured) at the time of the robbery 'They’re out here working and doing what they’re supposed to be doing and then these two suspects came in and cut that short, and certainly there was nothing in there that was worth the life of the 18 year old,' Detective David Crowder told the news station. Police do not believe anything was stolen during the incident. A GoFundMe page has been created to raise money for the 18-year-old's funeral costs. Flores has been described as a hero who 'pushed his mom away from danger and ended up taking a bullet.' Police described the perpetrators as two young black males. One suspect is believed to be between 18-20 years old, 5ft 6in to 5ft 8in, wearing a dark blue hoodie and black pants. The other suspect was described as 17 years old and light blue hoodie with dark pants. The two suspects also hit another Subway on San Jacinto and Wentworth at 8.45pm police said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:46:02.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
