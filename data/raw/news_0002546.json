In the U.K., 1.6 million people had signed a parliamentary petition calling for the invitation to be withdrawn. Prime Minister Theresa May says the state visit later this year will go ahead.\n“The work of World Jewish Relief enables us to rally together, to do what we can to support people practically, emotionally and spiritually,” the prince said in speech at a Jewish charity’s dinner on Monday night. “Particularly at a time when the horrific lessons of the last war seem to be in increasing danger of being forgotten.”\nQueen Elizabeth II, who has famously never given an interview in her more than six decades as monarch, has steered clear of any political commentary. Her son, on the other hand, does speak out on issues he feels passionately about, such as climate change and religious persecution. In December, he decried the rise of an “aggressive” populism against minority faiths.\nThe Sunday Times reported that if the visit went ahead, Charles planned to confront Trump over global warming.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Robert Hutton in London at rhutton1@bloomberg.net.
