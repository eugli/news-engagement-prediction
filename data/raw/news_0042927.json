'No question mark' \nThe firm has provided each force affected with a list of cases that may have been affected, and said some tests could be \"re-run\". \nIn a statement, it said there was no evidence to say alcohol samples had been affected and the investigation centres on the \"manipulation of quality control data, which supports test results\". \n\"A number of toxicology results have been compromised. RTS are working tirelessly to fully assess the impact and implications for each case. Where possible, when viable, samples will be re-run to provide robust, uncompromised results. \n\"There is no question mark over the RTS quality system or the robustness of our practices and procedures.\" \nChief Constable Debbie Simpson, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for forensic science, said Randox had provided each force with a list of cases that could have been effected. \n\"Working in partnership with the Crown Prosecution Service, we have provided guidance to forces so they are able to review each case to determine if compromised data played a part in prosecution and the CPS will then take appropriate action in any cases identified,\" she added.
