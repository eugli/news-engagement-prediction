Photo: Twitter Screen Grab Image 35 of 35 Willie D looking for rappers, producers and, um, boxers 1 / 35 Back to Gallery Willie Dennis has spent nearly 30 of his 50 years on Earth working in the hip-hop business and he was a successful young boxer as a kid. So he knows a lot about rap and, presumably, a few things about fighting. So it is that Willie D -- Houston hip-hop pioneer legend on his own and with the Geto Boys -- is launching a new record label, according to a long video clip he posted on Facebook today. You can watch it here .\nHe also apparently is looking to work with some aspiring boxers. If it sounds like he's playing around, he opens the video stating, \"I ain't playing around.\"\nDetails are scant so far, but Willie says he'd like to sign three or four rap acts \"real quick.\" And also maybe a boxer, though \"I don't want somebody out there embarrassing me.\"\nCONCERTS COMING: Headliners scheduled for Discovery Green series\nSubmission guidelines are pretty simple: Message Willie. He wants good video evidence of talent, be it with a microphone or a fist.\n\"If you can rap, let me hear the music. The music is going to speak for itself,\" he said. He added prospective talents need to be marketable.\n\"A whole new movement is starting, y'all,\" he declared.\nRapper Bun B Unveils New Era Caps in Houston\nMedia: MediaOS Video >>>Scroll through the
