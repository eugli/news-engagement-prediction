This is earlier than usual considering Apple’s iPhone production timeframe in the past where production is usually ramped up around July. \nAn early ramp in production does not mean that Apple will launch the iPhone 8 ahead of schedule, though. The Cupertino company is likely going to launch the iPhone 8 in September, just like it has all these years. The early ramp in production, however, is presumably being done by Apple to ensure that it is better able to meet the demand for the iPhone 8. \nThe most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that AAPL is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms, although we have no indication that there has been any change in release plans for the iPhone 8/X. Builds have been pulled in a few months while aggregate next generation forecasts have increased 10% from last month to 122M. Additionally, AAPL has adjusted iPhone 7, 7 Plus, and SE production downward in preparation for the next generation launch. \nAnalysts expect the iPhone 8 to sell in record numbers, and rightfully so since the handset will be releasing with a brand new design and many new features like an OLED display and wireless charging. Apple is reportedly preparing to manufacture up to 9M units of the iPhone 8 in June. The company has also reduced the production of the iPhone 7 and iPhone SE to go along with it. \nWhile there is a lot of buzz around the iPhone 8 due to its new design, it will be interesting to see if the handsets do end up helping Apple to a record-breaking Q4, 17. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus despite their modest external changes in combination with the massive marketing push from carriers and Apple allowed the Cupertino company to post its best-ever quarterly figures for Q4,16 where it sold 78 million iPhones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T10:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:10:46.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
