Although it’s hard to put a price tag on a keepsake like a Super Bowl jersey, it now has one. \nAccording to the police report, which was obtained by TMZ Sports , Brady’s jersey is being valued at $500,000. \nBecause of the huge number, this theft is being listed as a first-degree felony, which would likely carry jail time. So for the person who lifted Brady’s jersey, returning it isn’t nearly as simple as it may seem. \nA substantial punishment is waiting for the foolish soul who decided to steal it in the first place.
