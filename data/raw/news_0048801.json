Close share panel Presenter Piers Morgan has pulled out of hosting a TV awards night after criticism of his support for Donald Trump. \nThe host of ITV's Good Morning Britain said he did not want to distract from award winners. \nThe Royal Television Society announced Mr Morgan as presenter of its programme awards on Thursday. \nBut many TV figures criticised the choice, including awards judge Bonnie Greer. \nOn Twitter, Ms Greer said that she was \"honoured to be a judge\" for the awards but would decline to attend the dinner because of Mr Morgan. \nThe playwright, novelist and critic cited Morgan's support of President Trump , who has attacked TV news organisations as \"enemies of the American people\". Image copyright @Bonn1eGreer \nEmma Lindley, director of ITV's My Parents Are Aliens, tweeted : \"I don't want Piers Morgan representing me or any other RTS members.\" \nAnd Adrian Lester, star of the BBC's Undercover, responded to the news with: \"WTF?\" Image copyright @Emlin32 \nIn a statement on his Facebook page, Mr Morgan, a former newspaper editor, said he had agreed to present the awards free \"for fun\" but that a campaign to have him \"banned\" had been launched. \nHe said it criticised his creative credentials and suggested he did not \"understand a social movement that values equality and diversity of voice\". \n\"Apparently, this movement does not extend to tolerating my own diverse voice,\" he said. \nMr Morgan wished the nominees luck and said he did not want this \"silly noise\" to distract from programme makers' achievements.
