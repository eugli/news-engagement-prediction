Video: Livid Haye jeered off stage after being barred from face off with Bellew \nThe British rivals clash on Saturday in their heavyweight clash and Haye threatened to hospitalise Bellew in various interviews this week. \nHaye and Bellew enjoy a tumultuous rivalry with the pair attracting the attentions of the BBBC after punches were thrown at the press conference in November. \nThe BBBC secretary, Robert Smith, confirmed he had been made aware of the comments and insisted they were completely unacceptable. \n‘As a father, man and human being, I am very disappointed to see Haye’s comments about wanting to hospitalise Bellew,’ Smith told the Telegraph. Haye threw a punch at Tony Bellew at the November press conference (Picture: Getty) \n‘Why has he chosen to say something like that ? \n‘I’m disappointed on several levels and coming from someone who is deemed to be a role model it is clearly not right, and we will be speaking with him this week.’ \nHaye’s words are practically unsavoury considering the recent history of head injuries in the sport.

DAVID HAYE IS A SAVAGE!!! @mrdavidhaye pic.twitter.com/Q9FGyeZZBn \n— Strictly Boxing Fans (@BoxingBritain1) February 25, 2017 \nScottish boxer Mike Towell lost his life in the ring last year while Nick Blackwell and Edward Gutknecht put into induces comas due to head injuries suffered in fights. \nHaye warned Bellew he should do all he can to ensure his family do not watch the fight as he looks to end his opponent’s career through injury. \n‘I’d be very surprised if he (Bellew) has a licensed fight after March 4,’ said Haye. \n‘It’s a good thing he’ll get a big payday for our fight because that WBC title he’s got will be pointless. Haye and Bellew were cautioned by the BBBC in November (Picture: Lawrence Lustig) \n‘He’s so passionate. As he’s said many, many times, he’ll keep getting up. \n‘He said he’s willing to die in the ring. If that is the case, and he is telling the truth, I’m the last person on the planet you want to fight. Bellew has labeled Haye a disgrace for his threats (Picture: Getty) \n‘I punch that hard. The only thing that is going to happen is serious damage to his head. He has put himself in a very dangerous position. \n‘I hope if he does care for his family like he says he does, he does not invite them to the fight.
