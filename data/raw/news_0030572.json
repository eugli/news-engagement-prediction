Since we all age 20 years every day now, it's hard, I know. But if you think hard, you'll rememberâ€”those piercing blue eyes, that angular jawline. FINE FELON . \nJeremy Meeks, who came to be known as the Fine Felon, after his mugshot made the internet collectively swoon, made his official New York Fashion Week debut Monday night. A post shared by JEREMY MEEKS (@jmeeksofficial) on Feb 14, 2017 at 9:04am PST Meeks strutted his stuff in a black-on-black leather and fur ensemble for designer Philipp Plein's show, the New York Daily News reports, and walked the runway alongside similarly outfitted Young Thug , Desiigner , Pete Wentz, and Fetty Wap. A post shared by Philipp Plein (@philippplein78) on Feb 14, 2017 at 6:50am PST The show also boasted several mega-stars in attendance, with Kylie Jenner , Tyga, and Madonna seated front row. A post shared by Philipp Plein (@philippplein78) on Feb 14, 2017 at 8:25am PST Meeks was arrested and charged with street terrorism in California in 2014, a charge which admittedly sounds a lot more brutal than it was. In California, where Meeks was charged, street terrorism refers to gang-related activity.\nJust after his release last July , Meeks officially launched his modeling career with White Cross Management and has since been populating his Instagram with a lot of modeling shots, mostly involving him shirtless, or in the water, or alongside his family.
