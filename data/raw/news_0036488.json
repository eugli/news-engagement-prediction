Photo: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images The “big, beautiful” wall that President Trump has promised to put on the border between the U.S. and Mexico will be more of a fence if officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) get their way.\nAfter viewing an internal report from CBP and speaking to officials from both CBP and DHS, CNN says Trump will be pushed away from building the concrete and steel wall he has promised and toward a fence that covers less than half the length of the border.\nThe plan being most seriously considered at this point, CNN learned, is one that adds 177 miles of new fencing to the 654 miles that already exists, meaning 831 miles of the roughly 2,000-mile border would have a barrier. Importantly, that barrier would not be a wall.\n“I’m not calling it a wall, because we are talking about a fence that we can look through. That’s what we need,” one Border Patrol official told CNN. Another official who prefers a fence to a wall said, “you never want to have a barrier in place that will obstruct your vision, that prevents you from seeing the other side of the border.”\nThat may be a tough sell for Trump, who in January scolded a reporter for calling his border barrier a “fence.”\n“It’s not a fence, it’s a wall,” he said . “We’re going to build a wall.”\nTags: border wall president trump department of homeland security Report: Officials to Push Trump Away from Wall, Toward Fence Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories More White House Chaos Over Anti-Immigrant Policy Draft Paul Ryan’s Dream of Tax Cuts for the Rich Will Not Be Denied Andrew Sullivan: The White House Mole Most Viewed Stories The White House Mole Psychologists Think They Found the Purpose of Depression Jared Kushner Takes Trump’s Complaints About CNN to Time Warner Executive Former Obama White House Photographer’s Instagram Is a Master Class in Shade Trump Ends the Presidential Press Conference As We Know It Why Your Dog’s Personality Is a Lot Like Yours Donald Trump Thinks He’s Good at Being President Melania Trump Is Reportedly ‘Miserable’ in Her Role As First Lady The Great Wall Is Wonderfully Ridiculous Trump Somehow Found a Way to Insult Women at the Unveiling of an Airplane Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer The Wildest Moments From Donald Trump’s Press Conference Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 4:39 p.m. Upper East Side Parents Are the Latest Trump Resisters An elite boarding school allegedly had to cancel a field trip to the Central Park’s Trump-affiliated Wollman Rink.\n4:10 p.m. More White House Chaos Over Anti-Immigrant Policy Draft The Associated Press has a draft of a memo that suggests deploying as many as 100,000 National Guard troops.\n3:19 p.m. Senate Confirms Leading Opponent of Environmental Regulation As Head of the EPA Scott Pruitt will spearhead the Trump administration’s efforts to increase water pollution and accelerate man-made climate change.\n2:54 p.m. R.I.P.
