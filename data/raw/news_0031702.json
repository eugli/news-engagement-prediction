Understanding drug-resistant superbugs July 18, 2016 \nNews reports reveal drug-resistant super bacteria identified as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been found in the waters of Rio de Janeiro where the 2016 Olympics sailing events will be held. Great willow herb as an antitode in therapies against multi-drug resistant bacteria April 18, 2016 \nAlthough often considered a weed, due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, willow herb has long enjoyed a solid reputation for easing problems of the prostate gland and urinary tract. New tests confirm that ... The problem with antibiotics September 27, 2016 \nWe've all woken up with a sore throat that progresses to a runny nose by the next day. By the third day, we have a hacking cough, a pounding headache from the sinus congestion, and even fevers with chills. We drag ourselves ... Plant kingdom provides two new candidates for the war on antibiotic resistance June 20, 2016 \nScientists have isolated peptides (strings of amino acids) with antibiotic effects on bacteria that spoil food and cause food poisoning, after turning to the plant kingdom for help in boosting our arsenal in the ongoing war ... Genome mapped in battle to beat superbugs August 24, 2016 \nA Queensland scientist has completed the world's first gene decoding of a superbug bacteria resistant to all commercially-available antibiotics. Recommended for you New antibiotic from bacteria found on Kenyan ant could help beat MRSA February 15, 2017 \nA new antibiotic, produced by bacteria found on a species of African ant, is very potent against antibiotic-resistant 'superbugs' like MRSA according to scientists. Closer look at atomic motion in molecules may benefit biotech researchers February 15, 2017 \nEvery molecule holds a complex landscape of moving atoms â€“ and the ability to single out and examine individual nuclear vibrations may unlock to the secret to predicting and controlling chemical reactions. Now a new method, ... Molecular switch drives powerful movement by opposing twisting helices February 15, 2017 \nPlants are capable of producing powerful movement that is initiated at the molecular level. This fast motion is often supported by helix-based architectures, for example in vetches or orchids that spread seeds by explosive ... Research to help fight multi-resistant bacteria February 15, 2017 \nAn international collaboration led by scientists from The University of Western Australia has uncovered the three-dimensional molecular structure of a protein, called EptA, which is responsible for multi-drug resistance in ... Tumor-targeting system uses cancer's own mechanisms to betray its location February 14, 2017 \nBy hijacking a cancer cell's own metabolism, researchers have found a way to tag and target elusive cancers with small-molecule sugars. This opens treatment pathways for cancers that are not responsive to conventional targeted ... A scanning-tunneling microscope provides a glimpse of entropy in action February 14, 2017 \nNew research shows that a scanning-tunneling microscope (STM), used to study changes in the shape of a single molecule at the atomic scale, impacts the ability of that molecule to make these changes.
