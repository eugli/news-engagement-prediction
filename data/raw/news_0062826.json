They have also deposited Rs 2 crore with Bombay high court by way of guarantee till the final disposal of a case of copyright infringement. Roy Wadia has claimed Kangana’s role takes heavily from the lead character of Hunterwali (1935). bollywood Updated: Feb 24, 2017 15:57 IST Hindustan Times Kangana Ranaut plays Miss Julia, an action heroine in Rangoon. \nThe Kangana Ranaut-Shahid Kapoor-Saif Ali Khan-starrer Rangoon that released on Friday had a bumpy ride to the theatres. While Vishal Bhardwaj and the makers of Rangoon deposited Rs 2 crore with the Bombay high court, reports now claim they also made a whopping 70 cuts before the much-awaited movie hit the theatres. Shahid Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan also feature in the film. \nLast week, Roy Wadia of the production firm Wadia Movietone Pvt. Ltd, dragged Rangoon makers to court when he filed a commercial suit against director Vishal Bhardwaj and others, claiming that Ranaut’s character in the film drew heavily from that of ‘Fearless Nadia’ —the protagonist of its 1935 film Hunterwali. He had sought damages and as interim relief, urged the court to stay the release of the film. The Bombay high court, however, allowed the release of Rangoon, asking the makers to deposit Rs 2 crore with the high court by way of guarantee till the final disposal of the case.

The original length of the film was 2 hours 47 minutes after censoring. Now it is 2 hours 34 minutes. The product looks slicker and feels lighter. When the censor board members saw it they immediately warmed up to the re-edited product,” the report quoted a source as saying. \nFollow @htshowbiz for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:20:41.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
