Credit Rogelio Solis/Associated Press Stanley Dearman, the editor and publisher of a weekly newspaper in Philadelphia, Miss., whose editorials expressing outrage at the 1964 murders of three young civil rights workers helped set the stage for the belated conviction of a former Klansman for organizing the killings, died on Saturday in Gulf Breeze, Fla. He was 84. Mr. Dearman’s death was announced by the newspaper, The Neshoba Democrat, which he purchased in 1966 and ran until his retirement 34 years later. At a time when rigid segregation reigned in the Deep South, Mr. Dearman, a Mississippi native, called for justice in a case that became a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement. It was the basis for the 1988 film “Mississippi Burning.” On the night of June 21, 1964, a station wagon carrying James Earl Chaney, a black activist from Mississippi, and Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, white New Yorkers, was intercepted on a rural road by a gang of Klansmen who shot them to death. A deputy sheriff in Philadelphia had arrested the civil rights workers on minor charges earlier in the day, then released them after alerting the mob. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The victims, all in their 20s, had been taking part in Freedom Summer, a drive to register black voters in the South. They had been in Philadelphia investigating the Ku Klux Klan’s torching of a black church where a voter-registration drive had been held. A month and a half after the killings, their bodies were found buried in an earthen dam on a nearby farm. The authorities identified Edgar Ray Killen, a part-time preacher and sawmill operator, as a Klan organizer in the Philadelphia area and the man who had put together the mob that carried out the killings, though he was not at the scene of the murders. He was one of 18 men tried in federal court in Mississippi in 1967 on charges that they had deprived the victims of their civil rights.

Lesser for The New York Times Mr. Killen went free when the all-white jury could not agree on a verdict, but seven others were convicted. In editorials and articles, Mr. Dearman implored state officials to bring criminal charges. In the late 1980s, he visited New York to interview Carolyn Goodman , the mother of Mr. Goodman, for a series on the three victims, and they became friends.
