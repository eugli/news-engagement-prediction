It could mean that Apple is going to add inductive wireless charging to the iPhone 8, or iPhone X. This means owners will be able to place the phone on an inductive surface and it will charge. Wireless charging \nI nitial reports had suggested that Apple would bypass the technology, used in Samsung's Galaxy, Google's Nexus and Microsoft's Lumia, and wait until it had developed long-range wireless charging. \nAlthough Apple wasn't previously a member of the Consortium, which develops industry standards, it does already use Qi wireless charging for its Watch. \nSeparate rumours about the iPhone 8, due for release this year in celebration of the device's 10th anniversary, suggest it could have a curved edged OLED screen, a bit like Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. The rumours have gained weight recently with Apple reportedly purchasing 60 million OLED display panels from Samsung Display. \nThis adds to the 160 million OLED displays Apple allegedly bought last year. iPhone secrets, shortcuts and hidden features you should know about \nA pple is expected to ditch the home button on the anniversary iPhone to make way for an edge-to-edge display. It could also release three different phones, one with a 4.7-inch screen, a Plus model with a 5.5-inch screen and a high-end model. The high-end phone could be the only one with an OLED screen. \nThe news comes as Apple's stock hit an all time high on Monday. Its share price bounced 1.3 per cent to a record $133.82 (£107.37) after UBS said it is undervalued. \nApple confirmed that it is joining the Consortium but did not address reports that it is developing its own wireless charging. \n\"Apple is an active member of many standards development organisations,\" the company said. \"Apple is joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:17:35.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
