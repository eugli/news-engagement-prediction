He enlisted in the army in 1998 and left in 2013, although he remained an active member of the SAS reserves. \n\"When he was putting out fires he was helping people, in the army he was helping people – it was a service. \n\"Steve was a man who did some dangerous things, he saw life-threatening situations in the army and he came through but [on Tuesday] it came to an end.\" \nHis son had \"great courage, loyalty and a good sense of humour\". Ad Feedback \n\"He was an amazing guy, much respected and greatly loved. He loved his sense of belonging, his family was incredibly important to him. \n\"He's left two young children which is horrible. I had him for 38 years and a few days, they've only had him a short while.\" \nHis family were \"shattered\". \n\"It's awful for a woman to lose her husband years before his time.\" \nWay to Go Heliservices Limited principal Rob Kittow said Askin was a \"much loved and vital member of our team\". \n\"He has always exemplified the attitude of the quiet professional. Steve has always served his community, either with his career in the military or as [Tuesday] when he was fighting the Port Hills fire.\" \nAskin responded via helicopter when the alarm was first raised on Monday night to protect the threatened properties. He returned on Tuesday morning to help fight the fire. \nHe had an association with the company since 2008, first as a ground support and flying duties and was a valued member of the North Canterbury community. \n\"He was an inspiration to other staff with his professionalism and dedication to duty.\" \nNew Zealand Defence Force chief of army Major General Peter Kelly said Corporal Askin lived up to the finest traditions of the New Zealand Army. \n\"He was an outstanding soldier who served his country with bravery and commitment – the same bravery and commitment he showed in helping his community fight these fires. \n\"His performance was of the highest order and was in keeping with the finest traditions of New Zealand's military record.\" \nDefence Minister Gerry Brownlee said Askin was \"one of New Zealand's heroes\". \n\"For him to have lost his life trying to save other lives, as he effectively was, is a bit of a metaphor for the whole life that he's lived.\" \nAskin was a \"great New Zealander\" and his death was \"tragic\", Brownlee said. \nAskin was awarded the New Zealand Gallantry Star in 2014 for his service in Afghanistan, including an incident at the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul in 2011. \nThe Gallantry Star is New Zealand's second-highest gallantry award. \nDuring the incident, Askin was wounded by grenade and rifle fire, yet carried out on his mission and rescued guests from the hotel as fire broke out. \nHe was cited on several other occasions for exceptional bravery during operations in Afghanistan. \n\"During his time in Afghanistan, Corporal Askin displayed great gallantry and leadership in the face of the enemy. He put himself in the line of fire, and put the objectives of the mission before his personal wellbeing,\" Kelly said. \nAskin's award was announced, without his identity being made public, in December 2014. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:56:01.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
