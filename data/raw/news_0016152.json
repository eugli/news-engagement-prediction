They found groundhogs in profusion in many parts of the state and decided this mammal was a perfect replacement for the hibernators they’d left behind in Europe\nThis process is commonly called torpor.\nDuring torpor, body functions including heart rate, breathing rate, and brain activity are reduced.\nThe overall benefit for the animal is saving metabolic energy at a time when it isn’t eating.\nHowever, for some still unexplained reason, hibernators arouse periodically during their hibernating season.\nThese arousals come at a great energy cost.\nTherefore, arousing must be critical to survival in some way or animals wouldn’t waste the energy on it.\nVisitors look through the windows at the Punxsutawney Public Library where groundhogs are on display at 'Phil's Burrow' in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania on Monday, Feb. 1, 2016. Thousands of people come to Punxsutawney for the annual celebration of Groundhog Day on Gobbler's Knob on February 2\nSome possibilities include maintaining cellular functions or disposing of bodily wastes.\nIn Pennsylvania, these bouts of torpor and arousal continue throughout the hibernation season, starting on average in mid-November and ending by the beginning of March; a total of about 110 days.\nIn one study, an average of 15 bouts of torpor occurred during this period, with arousals in between.\nGroundhogs aroused for about 41 hours and then returned to torpor for about 128 hours for males and 153 hours for females.\nIn a 2010 study, we determined that the hibernation periods for groundhogs increase in length with increasing latitude.\nThe hibernation period matches winter’s duration.\nHibernation is characterized by a significant drop in body temperature and metabolic function. This process is commonly called torpor. During torpor, body functions including heart rate, breathing rate, and brain activity are reduced. However, for some still unexplained reason, hibernators arouse periodically during their hibernating season.\nThe celebration of Groundhog Day would need to change by latitude in order to perfectly match groundhog emergence.\nOne of the drawbacks of hibernation is the reduced time available for reproduction.\nThus, hibernators have developed mating strategies to maximize reproductive success.\nGroundhog mating strategies involve temporary emergence in early February, mating in early March during during their final arousal, and giving birth in early April.\nThis behavior enhances reproductive success because young are born as early as possible (but not too early) and are able to start feeding in May when lots of food is available.\nThat way they have enough time to gain sufficient weight to survive their first winter hibernation.\nBut why do groundhogs emerge in February, when mating won’t occur until next month?\nMost of the year, male and female groundhogs are solitary and antagonistic against each other. February is used to reestablish the bonds necessary for mating and ensures that mating can then proceed without delay in early March\nThe answer lies in their social structure.\nMost of the year, male and female groundhogs are solitary and antagonistic against each other.\nThey aggressively maintain a feeding territory around their burrows and rarely have any contact with each other.\nFebruary is used to reestablish the bonds necessary for mating and ensures that mating can then proceed without delay in early March.\nSo for the animals themselves, Groundhog Day is more like Valentine’s Day.\nOn February 2nd, groundhogs don’t emerge to predict the weather, but to predict whether their own mating season will be a success!\nStam Zervanos , Emeritus Professor of Biology, Pennsylvania State University\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .
