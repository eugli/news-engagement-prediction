Slot to 247Sports Links \nJameis Winston has apologized for comments he made during an appearance at Melrose Elementary School in St. Petersburg, Florida on Wednesday. During a portion of Winston's time addressing the third- to fifth-grade audience, he told the girls to sit down while he addressed only the boys stood and said \"ladies, they're supposed to be silent, polite, and gentle.\" \n\"All my young boys, stand up. The ladies, sit down,\" Winston said. \"But all my boys, stand up. We strong, right? We strong! We strong, right? All my boys, tell me one time: I can do anything I put my mind to. Now a lot of boys aren't supposed to be soft-spoken. You know what I'm saying? One day y'all are going to have a very deep voice like this (in deep voice). One day, you'll have a very, very deep voice. \n\"But the ladies, they're supposed to be silent, polite, gentle. My men, my men (are) supposed to be strong. I want y'all to tell me what the third rule of life is: I can do anything I put my mind to. Scream it!\" \nWinston later apologized for his comments, claiming that he only meant to motivate a boy in the audience who did not appear to be engaging with him. \n\"I was making an effort to interact with a young male in the audience who didn't seem to be paying attention, and I didn't want to single him out, so I asked all the boys to stand up,\" Winston said. \"During my talk, I used a poor word choice that may have overshadowed that positive message for some.\" Brandon Browner tweets about NFL life vs other sports Start SlideShow \nHanging over Winston's comments, which seem to reflect a negative attitude toward women, is the cloud of a sexual assault allegation that has followed him since his days at FSU.
