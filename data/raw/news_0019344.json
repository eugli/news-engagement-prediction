Speaking to the media outside her Poes Garden residence, minister K Pandiarajan said the names include all MLAs except Speaker P Dhanapal had signed on the resolution on that day. \nAccompanied by cabinet ministers and other seniors, Sasikala held a one-on-one discussion with the governor for about 15 minutes, Pandiarajan said, expressing confidence that she would be invited to form the government soon.
