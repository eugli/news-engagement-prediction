In their first full-throated defense of the executive order, the lawyers argue that a lower court's injunction \"contravenes the constitutional separation of powers ... harms the public by thwarting\" enforcement of the order, and \"second-guesses\" the President's judgment about the \"quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of aliens.\" Trump's order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria. DOJ appealing travel ban ruling Since the federal appeals court rejected a request to immediately reinstate the travel ban, lawyers for Washington state and Minnesota have until 2:59 a.m. Monday to file legal papers, and the Justice Department lawyers have until 6 p.m. Monday evening to reply. Then a three-judge panel will decide whether to schedule a hearing or issue a ruling. Justice Department lawyers face an uphill battle to vacate the lower court's order, but in making their arguments, they've laid out a broad defense that will replay in other upcoming challenges.

Bad people are very happy!\" The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 Standing The first line of attack in the 30-page brief centers on whether the two states involved, Washington and Minnesota, have the legal right to be in court. It's a threshold issue -- called \"standing\" -- but courts take it very seriously. A state has to prove that it has been harmed in order to bring the challenge. Noel J. Francisco, the acting-solicitor general who signed the brief, quotes precedent and stresses it is \"no part\" of a state's \"duty or power\" to enforce its citizens' rights in respect of their relations with the federal government. Francisco dismisses one argument put forward by Washington -- that its public universities will be harmed by the executive order-- noting that \"most if not all of the students and faculty members the state identifies are not prohibited from entering the United States.\" He argues the state's arguments are not good enough because they have \"identified only speculative harms it would suffer from temporary suspension of the entry of aliens affected by the order.\" He then turns to the President's power in the area of immigration. Again quoting precedent, he writes that the President's authority in the area \"is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate.\" JUST WATCHED", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T17:13:11.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
