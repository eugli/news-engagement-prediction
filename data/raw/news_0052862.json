An FIR has been registered at the Women Police Station at Sector 51 here. \n‘Couple threatened me’ \nThe woman’s complaint, however, comes four days after Mr. Jolly registered a case against her and her husband. He has accused the couple of trying to extort money from him. The couple was booked on charges of extortion and criminal conspiracy at the Kherki Dhaula police station on February 17. \nRubbishing the allegations, Mr. Jolly told The Hindu that the woman had been demanding money from him on the pretext of her husband’s illness. Later, the couple had threatened him. “They were on the run ever since a case was registered based on my complaint. Now, they have lodged a case as an afterthought,” said Mr. Jolly. \nIn her complaint, the woman, a resident of Neb Sarai, said that she had come to Gurugram on February 10 with Mr. Jolly to attend a meeting at the Aapno Ghar resort. They reached the resort around 1.30 p.m., after which they went into a room. \nI was drugged: woman \nThe woman said that she lost consciousness after drinking tomato juice. The FIR said that she found herself undressed when she regained consciousness two hours later. She then accused the former MLA of raping her. \nLater, she returned to Delhi with Mr. Jolly, vomiting twice on the way, said the FIR. The woman got down at a traffic signal in Mehrauli and took an auto-rickshaw to her house. She then confided in her husband, after which the duo lodged a complaint with the Gurugram Police on Tuesday. \nThe woman has claimed that she knew the former MLA for almost three years. \nThe Gurugram Police remained tight-lipped on the matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:56:31.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
