I donâ€™t think any of us paid any special attention to anyone. We only realised the four were at our restaurant after watching the CCTV footage,\" she added. \nThe whole area was covered by CCTV which was how the police were able to trace the two women. \nIt was also from CCTV footage that police identified the four North Korean suspects who were sitting some 50 metres from where Jong-nam, the estranged elder half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was attacked. \nSo, why did the women do what they did then and there when it should be obvious to them that their actions would be recorded? \nAfter all, as two Bernama reporters found, the CCTV was very visible to the public, and it covered the information and self check-in counter where the deed was done at about 8.20am on Monday. \nThe crime was committed at level three of KLIA2, some 50m from the information counter and the restaurant adjacent to it. \nIt took just 2.33 seconds to poison Jong-nam, who sought assistance at the information counter before being brought to the Menara medical clinic at level two. \nFollowing the route that Jong-nam took and considering his condition, we found that he needed 10 to 15 minutes to go down from level three to level two, passing level 2M. \nAs for the two women, going to level three to the taxi station on level one would take 15 to 20 minutes. \nThis is assuming that they are familiar with the layout of KLIA2, which is huge and complicated with many escalators heading towards different locations. \nAccording to reports, the two women told police they practised the act of covering Jong-nam with the cloth and fleeing several times, believing that it was all a prank. \nThe four who are believed to be the masterminds of the murder have been confirmed to have left the country and are reported to be in North Korea. \nIndonesian immigration said the four departed Jakarta for Dubai at 10.20pm local time last Monday. \nJong-nam was waiting for his flight to Macau when he was attacked. \nJong-nam, who was using a passport bearing the name Kim Chol, sought help at a customer service counter and was rushed to the Putrajaya Hospital but died on the way. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:09:32.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
