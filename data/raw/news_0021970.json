Kodi software is designed to play content freely available on the internet but can be modified to provide pirate access to live Premier League football, for which Sky Sports pay £11m-a-game. Sports industry sources claim one Premier League match this season had a record streaming audience of over 1million. The 'fully loaded' devices were seized at properties in Bootle, Bolton, Manchester and Cheadle The boxes are legal to use but can have illegal streaming services downloaded on them Kieron Sharp, director of FACT, said the arrests send a warning to anyone involved in illegal streaming: 'Anyone selling these boxes should not be surprised to receive a knock on the door.' The five arrested have been released on bail following questioning.
