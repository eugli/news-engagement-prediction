(Nick Ut/Associated Press) The Lakers made sweeping changes to their front office Tuesday, pushing out basketball operations chief Jim Buss and general manager Mitch Kupchak in favor of Magic Johnson. The dramatic moves lead to this important question: Have the Lakers ever looked at Johnson’s Twitter feed?\n[ The future of the Lakers is all on Jeanie Buss now ] \nThe question is worth asking because Johnson has long been something of a go-to source of unintentional comedy for ever-snarky Twitter users. The Lakers legend has frequently been mocked for offering painfully banal comments, but what might be more pertinent to Lakers President Jeanie Buss, or at least the team’s fans, are some of the 140-character player assessments he has posted.\nIt remains to be seen how hands-on Johnson is, in terms of day-to-day team operations, but he certainly will be expected to have a keen understanding of the NBA landscape and be able to identify talented players worth acquiring. That’s why this tweet might be a bit concerning:\nIf Brandon Knight were to come out, I would take him number 1 in the draft.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) March 27, 2011 \n\nKnight did, in fact, come out, so Cavaliers fans can be happy Johnson wasn’t running their team, which opted for Kyrie Irving at No. 1. Knight went eighth, just two picks ahead of another Magic favorite, Jimmer Fredette. Hey, what’s he been up to lately? Oh, scoring 73 points — in China.\nFor all of you out there questioning Jimmer Fredette of BYU, he is the real deal. #MenCare \n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) March 20, 2011 \n\nBut okay, that was almost six years ago. What kind of evaluations has Johnson made more recently?\nThe Bucks just acquired the next Jason Kidd in Michael Carter-Williams.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) February 20, 2015 \n\nI'm impressed w/ the Chicago Bulls starting Rondo, Butler, Wade & MCW off the bench they have the 3rd best group of guards in the league…\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) October 31, 2016 \n\nHmmm. That last tweet is interesting, because Johnson hasn’t just been guilty of overestimating Carter-Williams, he hasn’t quite gotten it right with Rondo, either.\nThe Dallas Mavericks' trade for Rajon Rondo puts them in position to be a contender in the Western Conference.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) December 19, 2014 \n\nMaybe guards just aren’t his thing, because here’s some glowing praise for Dion Waiters. In fairness, Waiters has been somewhat of a revelation recently for the Heat (not the Thunder, which was happy to dump him), so perhaps Johnson was simply way ahead of the curve.\nAwesome trade for the Thunder. Dion Waiters can catch and shoot and also create his own shot, just what the Thunder need.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) January 6, 2015 \n\n[ Candice Wiggins says she was bullied in WNBA for being straight ] \nJohnson will have one major advantage over other team’s executives, in that the Lakers have traditionally been a coveted destination for free agents. However, it’s not quite as simple as basing an offseason on nabbing one or more of the biggest, most obvious names available. Or is it?\nLaker Nation: DeMar DeRozan should be one of the free agents we go after this summer.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) May 2, 2016 \n\nLaker Nation: I would love to see Kevin Durant in the Purple & Gold!\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) May 2, 2016 \n\nLaker Nation: The Lakers should call LeBron James agent. We know he's going stay in CLE but they should go after him just in case he leaves.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) May 2, 2016 \n\nLeBron James, you say? I dunno, are you sure?\nIf you ran a poll of NBA coaches, I bet all of them would take @KingJames on their team in a heartbeat!\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) January 29, 2016 \n\nAlrighty, then. Speaking of obvious, this is where Johnson has most often brightened Twitter users’ days. Who could forget this pair of playoff-related gems?\nThe only way San Antonio or Miami don't win the championship is if neither team makes the finals.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) March 7, 2014 \n\nThe Warriors defeated the Thunder in game two tonight. Whichever team can win more games will go to the NBA Finals!\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicsTweets) May 19, 2016 \n\nThere’s more where that came from.\nWhen Steph & Klay are playing great together the Warriors are a hard team to beat.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) June 11, 2016 \n\nIf Cleveland is going to win Game 7, LeBron and Kyrie have to be special like they were in Game 5.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) June 17, 2016 \n\nThe next tweet is sort of doubly notable, because it makes what seems like an eye-gougingly obvious point, but in fact, it shows a lack of knowledge about the history of the NBA draft.\nLaker fans all over should be happy with the No. 2 pick because the Lakers will get another really good player.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) May 18, 2016 \n\nOver the years, No. 2 picks in NBA drafts have actually been notoriously sketchy. The Lakers had better hope that their own pair of players taken there, Brandon Ingram (2016) and D’Angelo Russell (2015), pan out, because previous selections have included Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (2012), Derrick Williams (2011), Evan Turner (2010), Hasheem Thabeet (2009), Michael Beasley (2008), Marvin Williams (2005), Darko Milicic (2003) and Stromile Swift (2000).\nAt least Johnson is taking over a team that appears to have put the worst behind it, literally, after posting the lowest winning percentages in franchise history in the previous two seasons. That’s not good, right?\nI thought last season was bad because it was the worst in Lakers history. It looks like this season will be the worst in Lakers history.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) March 29, 2016", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:40:35.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
