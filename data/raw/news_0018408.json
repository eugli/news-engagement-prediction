In Wales, the historic Plas Cadnant hidden gardens near the Menai Bridge on Anglesey faced a ‘tidal wave’ of flood water on Boxing Day 2015 following days of heavy rain, damaging plants and visitor facilities. The 130-year-old Corbridge Cricket Club, Northumberland, also had to have its clubhouse demolished as a result of flooding Orkney’s remarkable set of Neolithic homes at Skara Brae are considered to be at significant risk from climate change, including rising seas and more intense storms, while warm winters hit salmon numbers in the Rivers Wye and Usk. The chalk cliffs at East Sussex’s Birling Gap saw seven years of erosion in just two months during the winter storms of 2013/14. And William Wordsworth’s childhood home in Cockermouth, Lake District, has been hit twice by climate-related severe flooding in recent years, including during Storm Desmond, the Climate Coalition’s “Weather Warning” report said.
