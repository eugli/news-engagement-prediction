So she came in for the pictures and she was more photogenic than us, she was loving it, and it was just so much fun,” smith added. \nThe girls chatted with the woman and her husband before saying their goodbyes, but they never caught her name. \nSmith said later posted the photos online to show her friends. Since Sunday, the photo has been retweeted more than 75 thousand times and times more than 255 thousand times. \n“I just saw the picture and it made me smile, and I was thinking ‘oh my girlfriends will love this’, like 20 likes, 30 likes, and then it just blew up.” \nThe simple act has touched many who are taking to twitter to share positive messages. this is the cutest thing i've seen all day pic.twitter.com/RCC9XGHFdt", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:49:52.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
