Standing in a Los Angeles parking lot with the six-year-old, an obviously anguished Patton became increasingly distressed as she talked to a court-appointed monitor. She then appeared to abort the planned hand over, leaving with the child, whose father sat in a car throughout. Emotional: Paula Patton aborts parking lot handover of young son Julian to ex Robin Thicke as she arrives for court-ordered visitation on Thursday Standing in a parking lot with the six-year-old, an obviously anguished Patton became increasingly distressed as she talked to the court-appointed monitor Thicke did not talk to his son, who was seen watching, hand on hips, as his mother talked heatedly to the go between. A temporary restraining order prevents the Blurred Lines singer from making contact with Patton, but he is entitled to three multi-hour visits a week with his son, during which the monitor must be present. On Thursday the 39-year-old arrived 30 minutes prior to Patton, and did not leave his car while she was in the area. Empty handed: Thicke leaves the parking lot without his son after his ex aborted planned visit A source inside the Blurred Lines singer's camp told TMZ that Patton 'refused' to hand over Julian to the monitor, adding that she arrived late. But sources in Patton's camp insisted that by being in the parking lot, Thicke breached the current restraining order, which requires him to keep away from his ex, her mother Joyce and his son (except for slated visits). They also claimed Julian told his mother he did not want to go home with his father, and asked her to call 911. Disagreement: Sources in Paula's camp insisted that by being in the parking lot, Robin breached the restraining order, which requires him to keep away from Patton, 41, her mother Joyce and the boy (except for slated visits) Custody woes: This is not the first time there have been problems with Robin's planned visitation Police were called to the scene by Patton's camp, however both she and Thicke left before they arrived. This is not the first time there have been problems with Julian's court-ordered visitation. Last Friday the monitor nixed a visit that Julian didn't want to go on; and on Saturday, prematurely ended a visit in which Thicke took Julian to the Los Angeles children's attraction, Kids World. As a result Thicke went back to court this past week in a bid to modify his current visitation arrangement. Legal issues: Last month Patton won the temporary restraining order petitioned the court following a 'terrifying' January 19 incident in which she said her mother had to call the police after Thicke would not leave her home on the heels of an interview Julian had with social workers The legal team for the singer initially asked the judge to remove the stipulation requiring a monitor. When that request was denied they asked to replace the current monitor - amid claims the person was biased against the entertainer - and strip the monitor of powers to alter or cancel visits, TMZ reported. This was also denied. Last month Patton, 41, won the temporary restraining order petitioned the court following a 'terrifying' January 19 incident in which she said her mother had to call the police after Thicke would not leave her home on the heels of an interview Julian had with social workers. Not resolved: The case returns to court February 24 The Mission: Impossible â€“ Ghost Protocol actress told the court that the Give It 2 U artist abused drugs, was unfaithful during their eight-year marriage, and physically abusive to her in an April 2013 incident. The son of late Growing Pains actor Alan Thicke, Patton said, had been was belligerent with her during visits with their son in the near-two years since their split. Thicke's legal team struck back in saying that Patton's move came after couldn't persuade the court to give her sole custody of her Julian; and was alienating the boy from his father. The case returns to court February 24. Patton met Thicke at an 18-and-under club in Los Angeles when she was 15 and he was 14. The two dated throughout high school and college, marrying in 2005.
