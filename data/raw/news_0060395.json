Photo: Queen Garnet plums are advertised to be rich in antioxidants (ABC Rural: Michelle Stanley) \n\"And because it colours up so early, you're tempted to go in too early, and that would be the worst thing we could do.\" \nDue to the reported health benefits of the fruit, the Giumellis hope to be able to demand a premium price for the variety. \nIn its first weeks of sale, the Queen Garnet has been retailing for $15.90 per kilogram in one Australian chain supermarket. \n\"We'd like to get at least twice as much [return] as a regular [plum] for it,\" David Giumelli said. \n\"Obviously at the moment we haven't met the demand so it's quite hard to judge a level price that we're going to get for it.\" \nAlthough the Giumellis are concerned of pricing consumers out of the market, they believe at the end of the day the product compares more with blueberries than plums. \n\"The average price for blueberries is running at about $40 a kilo, we think $10 to $15 a kilo [for the Queen Garnet] is quite reasonable,\" David Giumelli said. \nA large part of the Giumellis taking the risk with the Queen Garnet comes from their belief in the health benefits, and the associated marketing opportunities. \nAlthough clinical trials with humans are ongoing, early results have been described as \"amazing'. . \nIn order to capitalise on the potential premium, the Giumellis have taking it upon themselves to prove the health benefits of their fruit, sending samples to a scientist in Perth, who is testing antioxidant levels. \n\"Every farm's different, every state's different, and to say that the fruit has this much antioxidants in Queensland would be, not lying, but we just want to, for our own peace of mind, test our fruit and that way we can really market with some confidence.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:15:02.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
