He has alleged he was the victim of police brutality during an April 2014 traffic stop that a store’s surveillance camera caught on video. \nIn 2015, a Nassau judge acquitted police Officer Vincent LoGiudice of assault charges after a trial in which prosecutors had alleged he beat Howell during that Westbury car stop. \nHowell still faces two misdemeanor drug charges from a November 2016 arrest, according to court records. In that case, police charged him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree and fifth-degree marijuana possession. \nCourt records show Howell also faces a misdemeanor drug possession charge from an arrest in January.
