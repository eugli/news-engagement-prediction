Bring on the past life regressions. Let’s get witchy. \nBellevue Hill resident Athena X is, as Victoria predicted, Jatz crackers. In the BEST possible way. \nShe’s deeply spiritual in that way we all were for that one week in grade 6 after we made a dreamcatcher at school camp but before we moved on to collecting Tazos. \nAthena and her husband run a high-end jewellery store. So high-end, in fact, it appears nobody can afford to shop there: Just flat out. Source: Foxtel \nShe meditates daily, and describes it as “a telephone between me and god communicating.” \nAthena believes in reincarnation, and she’s been here a few times before. Her most recent life wasn’t that great, “but I did a lot of clearing.” Like, of shrubs? \nAthena also paints. What is her artistic style? \n“It’s me allowing the universal intelligence called God to filter through my thoughts and my hand.” \nSo … colourful shapes, then: Athena bows down to a higher power: Mr Squiggle Source: Foxtel \nAthena lectures her three sceptical children about the fact — the scientific FACT — that there are eight dimensions, and that music shares the same frequency as time travel. Pray these kids aren’t home schooled. \nShe’s got a great relationship with her husband Panos, too: “Panos loves me more than he loves … God.” We’re starting to sense she chucks God in whenever she’s struggling to finish a sentence. \nMELISSA Real Housewives of Sydney caption Source: Foxtel \nHousewife tagline: “The hardest role I’ve ever played ... is just being me.” This is very deep but please don’t diminish your sterling work on E-Street , Melissa. \nWe have high hopes for former soapie actor and pop starlet Melissa Tkautz — mainly because we want to see a 2017 remix of Read My Lips top the charts. \nBut hang on — what’s this? Melissa announces during her intro that she never even liked the song. First strike, Tkautz. \nNowadays, Melissa spends her days in the studio turning out the club bangers Dannii Minogue rejected, working “with DJs, who are very relevant.” She doesn’t elaborate on this statement at all, which is kind of fabulous. \nShe lives on the Northern Beaches, she’s got two gorgeous young children and a shadowy rich husband who’s never seen. She also recently starred in Boar, a film in which she battled a bloodthirsty man-eating wild pig, which is really sort of an amuse-bouche for a starring role on Housewives when you think about it. \nTHE FIRST FIGHT \nNicole’s hosting an event on Sydney Harbour to welcome herself back to Sydney and the girls are all invited — some to meet each other for the very first time. \nFirst impressions are VERY important. “You have to put a little bit of thought into how you want them to perceive you,” says Athena, who it appears would like to be perceived as a Logie caught by a trawler: ‘Just check for bycatch and you’re good to go’ Source: Foxtel \nThe ladies begin stockpiling their ammo in their cars on the way to the party. Lisa’s ready to pounce on Victoria, because she made “very derogatory comments about my husband.” \n“So has half of Australia,” reasons Athena. \nNicole’s ready for her guests to arrive, and she’s trussed up like it’s her year 10 formal, age-inappropriate tiara and all: ... But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end? Source: Foxtel \nThe women filter in, with Melissa the last to arrive. Presumably she wanted to wait ‘til later, hands off her detonator. \nThey air-kiss, introduce themselves, and get down to picking fights that will last a season. \nRemarking on the diverse range of ethnicities on display among them, Krissy points to Athena and gives it her best Con The Fruiterer: “We’ve even got-a the Greek, m te!” \nAthena’s not happy with that, so she changes the subject in true Athena style, delivering a blessing from on high. \n“Nicole, I look into your eyes and I see a beautiful soul, and I give you Namaste,” she says. \n“Oh my god. Are ya gonna give me a bit of Namaste? Is that some yummy bread?” Krissy yells. \nShe’s gone very ‘Schoolies tour of India’ here and we’re not sure it’s quite landing. “Athena, shall we home?” “NAH IMMA STAY” Thank you we’re here all week Source: Foxtel \nAthena then schools the others on the meaning of Namaste, as though it’s some rare ancient phrase that she alone has discovered and not something everybody says at the end of yoga class. \nBut Krissy still seems to think Athena should be concentrating her efforts on a one-woman genderblind remake of The Wog Boy : “That’s not Greek, maaaate,” she drawls. \nKrissy just can’t shut up. She’s loud, boorish, tactless. Basically, she is all of us three wines deep at a dull party. \nLisa tries to deliver a heartfelt toast to Nicole, but midway through Krissy jumps in with yet another heckle. Lisa’s not having it. \n“CAN YOU JUST SHUT UP? LOOK CHEWBACCA: BACK OFF.” Let’s just be thankful she didn’t bring her gun Source: Foxtel \nChewbacca. CHEW. BLOODY. BACCA. \nRetreating to a corner with Victoria to lick her wounds, Krissy insists that she HASN’T EVEN WATCHED Star Wars so she’s ACTUALLY NOT EVEN MAD BRAH cos WHAT EVEN IS A CHEWBACCA. \nVictoria dutifully informs her: \n“It’s a big hairy unit.” \nSpeeches done, Athena once again regales the group with what Melissa slyly refers to as ‘spiritual chatter’. Melissa, bless her, just sort of shuts down and stares off into the middle distance: *Read My Lips plays on endless internal loop* Source: Foxtel \nVictoria cuts in to the unwanted spirituality seminar to suggest that Athena’s preaching is “a bit much.” \n“Victoria is a woman of very low vibration,” Athena informs viewers with utter certainty. “Spiritually, she’s nowhere enlightenment or an awakening.” \nAs Athena retreats to check her Tarot and perform a light smudging, Matty informs Victoria that their highly-vibrating new friend may not have achieved enlightenment herself: Before the party, she was gossiping that she’d heard Victoria was (shock, horror) a fat child . \nKrissy, who it’s becoming increasingly clear does have the social skills of a Wookie, somehow mishears the ‘child’ part of this, and starts telling Victoria that she’s only put on a few kilos recently and she’s not really looking that much fatter than normal. Dig UP, Chewie. Source: Foxtel \nAthena returns to the group and Victoria asks her about the ‘fat little girl’ gossiping. \n“What are you offended about? That you were a fat little girl when you were little? Isn’t that the reaaaalityyyy?” Athena asks. It may sound cruel, but don’t worry, she’s actually vibrating very highly. \nVictoria decides to rise above the taunts. Can the two start over as friends, she asks? And if so, can she try on Athena’s amazing fishing net cape? \nAthena agrees to this olive branch. How lovely! Female solidarity. What a sweet and tender mome- Oh Victoria that looks gorgeou- Source: Foxtel OH DEAR GOD. Source: Foxtel \n“You can go and get your f**king cape Athena, and I’ll see you later.” \nVICTORIA OUT. \nThe other Housewives are absolutely shocked at this admittedly pretty baller move. \n“I’m horrified! It’s not what women do,” says Melissa. \nAs Athena fumes — Where can she get a replacement net? Is Bunnings even open at this hour? — Victoria saunters off, giddy in the knowledge that she’s just delivered the first truly jaw-dropping moment of the season. What bitches (we love it). Source: Foxtel \n“D’ya know what? I did her a favour. That’s the ugliest coat I’ve ever seen in my life,” she cackles as she and Krissy flee. \n“I’m just worried it’s going to choke a dolphin.” \nNext week: Bitching, bitching and more bitching. The girls organise a group lunch — but is Athena off the invite list? And which Housewife turns up to the all-white lunch dressed in black? (Clue: She’s Most Definitely Not Like Other Girls). \nThe Real Housewives of Sydney screens 8:30pm Sundays on Foxtel’s Arena Channel.
