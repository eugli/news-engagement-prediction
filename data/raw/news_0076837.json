Then the Western Cape property market started booming because it was \"less dependent\" on commodity prices, said Rode. \nThe property boom started picking up three years ago. \n\"I attribute it to not only the economic factor.but also there is a governance issue,\" he said. \nEconomic opportunities MEC Alan Winde said the province's popularity was driving property prices up. \n\"The property prices are increasing way in excess of inflation,\" said Winde. \nMany who had bought property in the past year were not interested in moving. \nA substantial proportion of buyers were investors. \nGauteng agents of Sotheby's International Realty have reported that up to 40% of the properties they list are put on the market because owners are moving to Cape Town. \nKaren Bosman, area specialist for Lew Geffen Sotheby's International Realty in Benmore, Hurlingham Manor and Parkmore in Johannesburg, said in the past year about 25% of her sellers moved south. \nCompany chairman Lew Geffen said buyers range from the super-wealthy to the middle classes. \n\"Not everybody who is currently buying property in Cape Town intends to live here immediately. The number of bond registrations in the province originating from Gauteng will be inflated by people buying second-home, entry-level properties to get onto the Cape Town ladder now while homes are still relatively affordable,\" he said. \nAndrew Golding, CE of the Pam Golding Property group, said Zille's remarks were supported by the FNB Repeat Home Buyer Study 2012, which found that \"the Western Cape has by far the strongest net inward migration rate of repeat buyers from other provinces\". \n\"The bank has said that the acceleration of net inflow of repeat home buyers in 2016 accounted for much of the Western Cape's superior house price growth last year,\" said Golding. \n\"According to the PGP Index, house price inflation for the Cape between January and October 2016 was 11.55%, well above the national average of 4.9%. \" \nKelly said his family was enjoying life in Cape Town although everything was pricier.
