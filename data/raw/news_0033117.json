IndiaToday.in | Edited by Shashank Shantanu A + A - AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala \nAIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala suffered a major jolt with the Supreme Court upholding the trial courtâ€™s judgment convicting her in the 21-year-old disproportionate case against her. With this, Sasikala stands disqualified to take over as Tamil Nadu chief minister. \nThe apex court set aside the Karnataka High Court judgment of May 11, 2015 which had acquitted Sasikala and former chief minister late J Jayalalithaa in the Rs 66.65 crore disproportionate assets case. Besides being disqualified to contest elections for 10 years, Sasikala will also be arrested and sent to jail after the Supreme Courtâ€™s order. \nAs a consequence, decks are now clear for Tamil Nadu caretaker Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, who has been locked in a bitter battle with Sasikala since last week over the CM's chair, to take over on the post. \nWHAT IS THE DA CASE AGAINST SASIKALA \nSasikala and her relatives V N Sudhakaran and Elavarasi are accused of allegedly amassing disproportionate asserts to the tune of Rs 66.65 crore during Jayalalithaa's first term as Chief Minister from 1991 to 1996. Jayalalithaa was also an accused in the case. \nIn May 2015, Sasikala was acquitted by the Karnataka High Court in the disproportionate case. Jayalalithaa and two other accused were also acquitted in the case. \nThe Karnataka government then moved the Supreme Court against the high court's ruling. \nThe Supreme Court had reserved the verdict in the 19-year-old illegal wealth case after 20 days of arguments in the case last year. \nThe apex court had sought replies from all the accused including Sasikala before the it took a break to study the records pertaining to the disproportionate assets case. \nALSO READ: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T12:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T07:16:17.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
