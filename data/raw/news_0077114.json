So... what I miss?\" the 'Family Feud' host joked. \nSteve Harvey feels for Warren Beatty and he let the veteran actor know he was there for him following a massive blunder at Sunday's 89th Academy Awards. \nBeatty and his Bonnie and Clyde co-star, Faye Dunaway, presented best picture, and due to a snafu they said La La Land won when actually Moonlight was the true victor. \nShocked viewers immediately took to social media to express their surprise and joke about the mistake, many pointing to comedian Steve Harvey, who had a similar experience when he hosted the December 2015 Miss Universe pageant. \nThat night, the Family Feud host mistakenly announced Miss Colombia, Ariadna Gutiérrez, as the winner, then had to reverse and say the real winner was Miss Philippines, Pia Wurtzbach. \nOscars host Jimmy Kimmel even joked amid the mix-up, \"I blame Steve Harvey for this.\" \nHarvey hopped on Twitter Monday morning and spoke out to Beatty and the rest of his 3.4 million followers. \n\"Good morning everybody! Went to sleep early last night. So... what I miss?\" He tweeted. \"Call me Warren Beatty. I can help you get through this!\" \nHe also tweeted for his fans to tune into his morning radio show. \"YOU KNOW I have something to say,\" he added. \nWhile Beatty bore the brunt of the criticism for Sunday's Oscar mistake — likely the largest in the award show's history — it was not his fault. The accounting firm in charge of the ballot-counting process said in a statement late Sunday that \"the presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.\" \nStill, the Internet had a ball with the screw-up and countless memes and gifs were created making fun of the moment and some of those involved.
