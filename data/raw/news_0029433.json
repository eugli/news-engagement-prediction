Le Pen paid homage to the 86 victims of an attack last year in Nice, with a visit Monday to the city’s famed seaside promenade where revelers were mowed down by a truck while celebrating Bastille Day.\nLe Pen was then heading to the border post in Menton, where migrants often try to enter France from Italy.\nShe wants France to better control its borders to fight illegal arrivals, quitting the border-free Schengen zone as well as the European Union.\nPolls suggest Le Pen will place among the top two in France’s April 23 first-round election, but will struggle to win the May 7 runoff.\n London , France , French Presidential Elections 2017 , Marine Le Pen", "external_links": ["http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fle-pen-zeroes-security-migration%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Le+Pen+Zeroes+in+on+Security%2C+Migration&shortener=bitly", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fle-pen-zeroes-security-migration%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Le+Pen+Zeroes+in+on+Security%2C+Migration", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fle-pen-zeroes-security-migration%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Le+Pen+Zeroes+in+on+Security%2C+Migration"], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:34:08.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
