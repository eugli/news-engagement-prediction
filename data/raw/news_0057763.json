What she describes is abhorrent and against everything Uber stands for and believes in.” \nMashable first spotted the message, and confirmed it as genuine with an Uber spokesman. A source additionally told Business Insider that the message was indeed genuine, but that it only went to a handful of US users, and has since been updated. \nThe message was sent to users who reference Fowler’s post in their deletion request. The number of deletion requests relating to Fowler has also been low, according to Mashable’s report. \nIf you’re a UK user and delete your Uber account, citing Fowler’s blog post, you won’t see the same message. \nFowler made her allegations public on Sunday, prompting CEO Travis Kalanick to launch an internal investigation into the claims . She alleged that she was propositioned for sex by a manager, that HR lied to her, and that her manager threatened to fire her for reporting sexist incidents. \nKalanick has hired former US Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the claims, along with Tammy Albarran. Both are partners at law firm Covington & Burling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:21:13.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
