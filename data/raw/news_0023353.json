If you'd like to learn more... - \nEnvironment Canada says the Greater Toronto Area could see up to 10 centimetres of snow by the end of Friday. \nThe weather agency issued a special weather statement warning of winter driving conditions. \n“Untreated roads will become snow covered and slippery. Low visibility from occasional blowing snow is possible. Hence, motorists should allow extra time to reach their destination,” the statement read. \nWeather conditions have resulted in delays on area roads, including some transit services. The snow may be over but the cleanup continues, roads still slippery.
