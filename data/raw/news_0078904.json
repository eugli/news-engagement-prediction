such as Fences, Moonlight , Hidden Figures and Lion .\nThe Academy was criticised for overlooking actors and actresses of colour and films that portrayed non-white narratives for the past two years. In 2016, no non-white talent was recognised in any of the four acting categories . \nDenzel Washington and Viola Davis in Fences Credit: David Lee V iola Davis received her third Oscar nomination for her Best Supporting Actress-worthy performance in Fences, alongside co-star Denzel Washington , who was given a Best Actor nomination. Mahershala Ali was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Moonlight, while Octavia Spencer received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress in Hidden Figures.\nBritish stars were also recognised: Dev Patel in a supporting role for Lion, and Naomie Harris was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Moonlight. Ruth Negga, who grew up in Ireland after being born in Ethiopia, was given a Best Actress nomination for Loving . British actor Andrew Garfield received a nomination as leading actor in Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge . \nRecord-breaker? La La Land N on-white filmmakers have been nominated in other categories. Moonlight director Barry Jenkins was recognised in the Best Director category, making him only the fourth-ever black best director nominee. Bradford Young has become the first black cinematographer to be nominated in the category.\nThe Best Picture category was also considerably more diverse, with Fences, Hidden Figures, Moonlight and Lion being nominated alongside Hell or High Water , Hacksaw Ridge, Arrival and La La Land . \nOscars favourite La La Land did as well as predicted, scooping 14 nominations – the tied record between Titanic (1997) and All About Eve (1950) . The number of nominations, which includes two in the same Best Original Song category, makes the Damian Chazelle-directed film the most Oscar-nominated musical in history, beating Mary Poppins' 13 nominations. \nLa La Land remains the favourite to win Best Picture, winning odds of 9/2 from bookmakers William Hill. Although the Best Picture nominees are the most diverse in recent years, the musical has been criticised for its lack of diversity , with Best Actor nominee Ryan Gosling cast as a white man who hopes to save jazz. \nFor the first time in history, the nominations were not announced at a press conference attended by members of the entertainment media. Instead, Academy officials are bypassing the opportunity for journalists' questions and revealing the nominees in a global web broadcast on the Oscars website. \nThe winners will be announced at the awards ceremony on 26 February, 2017.\nOscars 2017 nominees Best performance by an actor in a leading role C asey Affleck - Manchester By The Sea\nAndrew Garfield - Hacksaw Ridge\nRyan Gosling - La La Land\nViggo Mortensen - Captain Fantastic\nDenzel Washington - Fences\nAndrew Garfield in Hacksaw Ridge Best performance by an actor in a supporting role M ahershala Ali - Moonlight\nJeff Bridges - Hell or High Water\nLucas Hedges - Manchester By The Sea\nDev Patel - Lion\nMichael Shannon - Nocturnal Animals\nDev Patel and Rooney Mara in Lion Best performance by an actress in a supporting role V iola Davis (Fences)\nNaomie Harris (Moonlight)\nNicole Kidman (Lion)\nOctavia Spencer (Hidden Figures)\nMichelle Williams (Manchester by the Sea)\nWatch | Viola Davis' rise to fame - in 60 seconds 01:03 Best performance by an actress in a leading role I sabelle Huppert (Elle)\nRuth Negga (Loving)\nEmma Stone (La La Land)\nNatalie Portman (Jackie)\nMeryl Streep (Florence Foster Jenkins)\nNatalie Portman in Jackie Best Director A rrival – Denis Villeneuve\nHacksaw Ridge – Mel Gibson\nLa La Land – Damien Chazelle\nManchester by the Sea – Kenneth Lonergan\nMoonlight – Barry Jenkins\nKenneth Lonergan with Casey Affleck on the set of Manchester by the Sea Best Picture A rrival\nFences\nHacksaw Ridge\nHell or High Water\nHidden Figures\nLa La Land\nLion\nManchester By the Sea\nMoonlight\nWatch | Moonlight trailer 02:02 Cinematography A rrival\nLa La Land\nLion\nMoonlight\nSilence\nArrival Documentary Feature F ire at Sea\nI Am Not Your Negro\nLife, Animated \nOJ: Made In America\n13th\nLife, Animated Documentary: Short Subject E xtremis\n4.1 Miles\nJoe’s Violin\nWatani: My Homeland\nThe White Helmets\nForeign Language Film Land of Mine\nA Man Called Ove\nThe Salesman\nTanna\nToni Erdmann\nBest Costume Design Allied (Joanna Johnston)\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (Colleen Atwood)\nFlorence Foster Jenkins (Consolata Boyle)\nJackie (Madeline Fontaine)\nLa La Land (Mary Zophres)\nBest Original Score Jackie (Mica Levi)\nLa La Land (Justin Hurwitz)\nLion (Dustin O'Halloran, Hauschka)\nMoonlight (Nicholas Britell)\nPassengers (Thomas Newman)\nBest Original Song Audition (La La Land)\nCan’t Stop the Feeling!
