San Jose council member Lan Diep was recently sworn into office while holding Captain America’s shield; a Republican, Diep later stated he was “upset” by the immigrant ban. In a more pointed deployment of Cap’s image, cartoonist Vishavjit Singh cosplayed as “Sikh Captain America” on Inauguration Day, holding a sign reading, “Black, Muslim, Trans, Latino, Asian, White … We all Make America Great.” Let's remember the noble words of Captain America today. #Resist #Peace pic.twitter.com/ijPUR5sj5L — Kyle Anderson (@FunctionalNerd) January 20, 2017 One of the most memorable Captain Americaimages to circulate recently is the famous 1941 Captain America cover, originally drawn by legendary comic artist and Captain America co-creator Jack Kirby, in which Captain America punches a Nazi . The Kirby drawing has become surprisingly relevant within the past couple of weeks, spawning a viral meme and prompting discussion around the history of superheroes punching Nazis . A remix in which Kamala Khan punches Trump was created in 2015 but began recirculating among fans in the wake of Trump’s election, as fears about his proposed ban on Muslims grew. Kamala Khan v Trump by hiphopmummy on DeviantArt Melissa Groben, the daughter of Captain America’s other creator, Joe Simon, recently told the Hollywood Reporter that there is no wrong way to use the image of the iconic superhero: “We all find whatever we need in a particular character, whatever that may be. So, I can't say that the way anyone is using the character is wrong.” … “[Kirby and Simon] created Captain America to go after Hitler because our country wouldn't go after Hitler. My father was very, very, very pro America, pro Jewish, he was very traditional, and it was a different world back then.\" Given that superheroes are known to punch people, many of the artistic resistance involving them has also involved a lot of punching. A widely circulated image by an anonymous artist of Wonder Woman punching Trump spawned a thread of superhero resistance fan art. Someone please draw more pictures of female superheroes punching Trump. We can't stop with just Wonder Woman. pic.twitter.com/gSiaAeoVc6 http://axelmedellin.tumblr.com/post/156559863079/daily-sketch-29-january-2017-hellboy Not everyone has embraced the use of Ms. Marvel, Captain America, and others as symbols of sometimes-violent resistance, pointing out that Captain America would be in favor of protecting even neo-Nazi free speech, and arguing that Ms. Marvel would be in favor of an immigration vetting system designed to ward against terrorism. Still, some of the fan art produced in recent days has maintained hope for unity and camaraderie in times of turmoil — a goal you don’t have to be a superhero, or even a protester, to strive for.
