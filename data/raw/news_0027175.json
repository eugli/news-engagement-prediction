Current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is facing a crisis as support for his leadership was brought into question yet again over the weekend after it was revealed Labour was lining up potential replacements to oust him. Getty Socialists have always been linked to Labour unions In Europe, centre-Left parties have been hit with serious losses, with the previously popular French Socialists dipping to fourth place, the Dutch Labour Party plunging to seventh and Greece's PASOK party, which has led the country since the early 1980s, only having seven per cent of the population's support. The PSOE party in Spain and Social Democrats in former communist countries in eastern Europe are doing even worse, he said. Mr Hannan said the losses could be easily blamed on centre-Left established parties supporting the euro in the 1990s which then brought poverty and tax increases, however the real reason is the Left has lost sight of how the modern world works. Writing in the Washington Examiner, the senior member of the Vote Leave campaign said: \"But a collapse on such a scale doesn't happen overnight. \"The parties aligned to the Party of European Socialists - the main Centre-Left bloc in Europe - dominated Europe in the 1990s and, as late as 2004, were still more likely to be in office than not. Jeremy Corbyn wins Labour leadership election Sat, September 24, 2016 Jeremy Corbyn has won the Labour leadership race against rival Owen Smith in the election contest that lasted three months.

Getty Francois Hollande's French Socialist Party has seen a dip in popularity Getty Mr Hannan said people should be questioning why Clinton lost not why Trump won \"Membership of those unions, especially those representing private sector workers, is falling in every industrialised country. \"That fall reflects a shift from mass industrialisation to self-employment. \"As technology accelerates, we are likelier to become portmanteau workers, specialists who constantly renew our expertise.\" Moving over the Atlantic to the United States, he said the question which should be asked is why the Democrats lost when Mr Trump secured fewer votes than either John McCain or Mitt Romney.

Instead of those on the Right celebrating the downfall of the left, Mr Hannan said it should give his fellow Conservatives \"no pleasure\". Mr Hannan, added: \"Without serious opponents, we can become flabby, self-serving, even corrupt. \"Ask yourself, for example, whether the absence of a credible alternative makes Trump more or less likely to distinguish between his commercial interests and his public office.\" The polyglot said he believes the Left \"will renew itself\" as there will \"always be a space in politics for parties that favour more equal outcomes\". However, he added: \"I just hope the Left gets its act together soon. Someone needs to offer an opposition.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:33:42.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
