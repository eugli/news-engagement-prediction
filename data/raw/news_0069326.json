The vehicle was on fire and the driver was caught in side which made the situation very dangerous,” said officer Lenckus. \nThe driver of that car ran over four pine trees and one of them fell on top of the car, pinning the driver inside, according to police. \n“We could see smoke coming from the engine, the front of the car and smoke in the air,” described Officer Pulis. \nNeighbors said that the driver was yelling for help and they watched as the officers used a fire extinguisher to help remove him from the car. \n“It was a bad accident, the car was wrapped around the tree,” said neighbor, Melissa Covarruias. \nThe driver of the burning car is expected to recover. The investigation into the cause of the fire is ongoing. Brittany Jeffers facebook Follow Brittany Jeffers is proud to call Dallas ‘home’ after she recently joined the team as a reporter at CBS 11.
