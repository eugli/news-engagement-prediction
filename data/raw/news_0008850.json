The study, which was published in the Translational Psychiatry journal, is the first of its kind conducted in the US. It noted that women who live in heavily polluted areas - such as near main roads or busy city centres are 81 per cent more at risk for cognitive decline. Theory: According to the data, pollution could be responsible for a fifth of dementia cases While they are also 92 per cent more likely to develop dementia if they are exposed to levels deemed unsafe by health officials. And it also found that women with the APOE4 gene - a variation that increases the risk of Alzheimer's - were most at risk. AIR POLLUTION CRISIS Air pollution which plagues the UK threatens the human rights of children, a United Nations expert has warned. There is an urgent need for the Government to protect children and other at-risk groups from the air pollution 'crisis' which causes serious health problems, special rapporteur on hazardous substances and wastes Baskut Tuncak said. The Government has repeatedly been taken to court over its failure to meet EU standards on air pollution and has admitted it might not meet the rules in London and some other cities until 2025. Worldwide, nearly 48 million people suffer from dementia, and there are 7.7 million new cases every year, according to the World Health Organization. Earlier this year, scientists in Canada found that living close to a busy road increases the risk of Alzheimer's by up to 12 per cent. They tracked the progress of six million adults for 11 years found a clear trend with dementia incidence rising the nearer people lived to main roads. Compared with those whose homes were more than 300 metres away, people living within 50 metres of heavy traffic had a 7 per cent higher risk of developing dementia. While Danish researchers earlier this year found expectant mothers living close to busy roads are at greater risk of serious complications in pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia – a condition suffered by 42,000 pregnant women in Britain each year – is made more likely by noise and pollution from roads.
