It’s our vision in the future that we’ll be able to offer a single price for the car, maintenance and insurance in a really compelling offering for the consumer. And we’re currently doing that today. \nThe insurance, Evanson notes, isn’t an attempt to exclude insurance providers. Although the company has looked into underwriting policies in-house, it intends to leave the heavy lifting to insurance companies, at least for now. \nTesla believes the safety record of its vehicles leaves the company uniquely positioned to offer this type of pricing package. Time will tell whether others follow suit, but I think it’s safe to say we’re all rooting for the program’s success.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:41:46.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
