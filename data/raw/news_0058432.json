It was actually a great year for women in movies, something this year's strong batch of Oscar nominees reflects . \nA new study from San Diego State University's Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film found that 29 percent of the 100 highest-grossing films of 2016 (domestic) had female protagonists. That's an impressive 7 percent jump from 2015. With films like The Girl on the Train and Rogue One slaying the box office, this stat makes total sense and proves female-led movies are good for business. \nAnd that's not the only good news: Female characters as a whole are up in film. In 2016, women played 37 percent of all major characters in top movies—a 3 percent jump from 2015. Plus, roles for Asian and Black women increased as well—by 3 percent and 1 percent, respectively. Hopefully, Hollywood producers take these exciting statistics to heart; they all but confirm that female-fronted entertainment isn't niche. People crave stories about women—and these stories can deliver at the box office! Hidden Figures wasn't a fluke, people. \nBut there is some bad news: The number of Latina women in the top films dropped from 4 percent to 3 percent. Also scary: Women made up only 32 percent of all speaking characters in 2016's most popular flicks—a 1 percent dip from 2015. The study also found that audiences still respond more to male characters than female. \nThese latter statistics are admittedly disheartening, but there is a solution: Hire more female writers and directors. The New York Times took a look at this study and noted an interesting statistic: When the writer or director of a film is male, the lead character is a woman roughly 18 percent of the time—but this jumps to 57 percent when women are at the helm of a project. \nOf course, we're excited to see all of this progress for women in movies, but there's still so much left to do. With Ava DuVernay heading A Wrinkle in Time and Niki Caro steering Disney's Mulan reboot , it seems like the tides are changing. They just need to change a little faster.
