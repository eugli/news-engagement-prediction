Credit: From Bloomberg/Getty Images Some candor: I cannot come close to getting a handle on the unending stream of Donald Trump -related news , commentary, tweets, snafus, outrages, and actions that have emerged in the space of the past week. I doubt anyone can. By the time you’re reading this, it’ll be a fading set of thoughts about the Donald of 12 hours ago, and the Donald of Now will have kicked another set of wasps. Since Friday, I’ve changed my mind a dozen times on what I’ve been seeing, in an effort to figure out what’s real or unreal, serious or unserious, good or evil, hysterical or reasonable. C.E.O.s have to act cool and omniscient. Journalists just have to stay honest—or at least try to. So let me offer some provisional thoughts on Trump, his orders, his strategy, and, of course, his so-called “Muslim ban.” It’s clear that Trump doesn’t intend to reassure people right now as much as stun them. In line with reports that Jeff Sessions and others recommended he take a shock-and-awe approach to his first weeks, Trump appears to be taking an approach of bombardment followed by invasion. When you’re pounding the positions of the opposing force, you don’t expect every bomb or shell to land properly, nor do you know how much effect you’ve had. You just fire away and then see what’s left behind the smoke. Explosions in one place will distract from explosions in another. Think of how distant in memory are the agitated warnings of trade war with Mexico. Mexico? That’s very last week. We’re seeing a new theory of power being tested. With advice from Republican allies on how to wield executive action to maximum effect, Trump has exercised the muscle of his office while employing his signature approach to media news cycles, which is to distract from one blowup by causing another. Since Washington has a reputation, well-deserved, for drowning every attempt to change things in years of deliberation and obstruction, Trump has launched a host of surprise attacks. Instead of picking one priority, Trump is attacking on all fronts, deliberately overdoing it, and seeing what it gets him. In the category of overdoing it, nothing has surpassed Trump’s executive order from Friday , the one that suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and banned arrivals of people from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen for 90 days. While it’s hardly as dangerous or worrisome as several of Trump’s other moves—saber-rattling against China matters more, and most Muslims in the world are unaffected by it—this particular action stood out for its indecency of spirit and execution. VIDEO: Donald Trump’s Conflicts of Interest The specifics of the order made little sense. Trump didn’t bar citizens of Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, for instance, even though these are countries that have exported an outsize share of terrorists. On the other hand, he did bar visitors from Iran, even though few of its emigrants to the United States have given us any trouble apart from ugly houses in Beverly Hills. The suddenness of the order made no sense, either. Why not warn people? Trump’s answer, via tweet : “If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the ‘bad’ would rush into our country during that week.” That, too, seems absurd. How would that apply to people who had already purchased tickets? Worst of all was the barring even of holders of green cards. Again, why? All of it seemed ham-handed and cruel. One theory is that Trump deliberately went too far . By pulling back on the green card provision, he could grant his foes the feeling of a victory, even as he kept most of the rest of it in place. Even if that’s true, however, Trump still seems to have been caught by surprise. That senior adviser Stephen Miller , the brains behind the order, got sent out on television to defend it suggests that the rest of the White House is, despite bluster from the president, at a loss. You wrote this; you go deal with it . If Trump really had no idea that his order went that far, then the star of Miller and Steve Bannon , one that has burned brightly for the past several weeks, will be dimmed, and that of Reince Priebus and Mike Pence will once again be on the rise. We’ll see. Trump’s approval ratings are, according to the conservative-leaning Rasmussen Reports , still O.K., at 51 percent. (Gallup puts him about eight points lower .) But this weekend almost certainly cost him political capital. Many Republicans do not want to be associated with this blowup. Reports of mothers in wheelchairs detained for endless stretches, with the likelihood of being sent back on the next flight, are offensive to almost anyone. Nor did it help Trump that thousands of Americans suddenly journeyed out to airports to give loud—and peaceful—voice to something they viewed as unworthy of their country. Then there was the sickening news of a shooting of peaceful Muslim worshipers at a mosque in Quebec by someone who appears to have been a far-right nut. During the presidential campaign, several of Trump’s warnings about Islamic terrorism were followed in short order by incidents of Islamic terrorism. This time, however, an anti-Muslim executive order was followed in short order by what looks like an anti-Muslim massacre. While Trump has done plenty to cause disgust, the blowups did highlight, if anyone was in doubt, how incoherent our debates on immigration remain. Twitter was alight with images of victims of the Nazis who were killed after being denied refuge in the United States. But this has less to do with our current policies, since those we take in are generally coming from camps, not from war zones. Also, unless we intend to take in every refugee in the world— about 21 million and rising , and that’s not including another 30 million displaced people—saying no to most of those seeking refuge is a fact of life. Immigration fights highlight the odd moral code in Washington: it’s American to arm Saudi Arabia and help it to destroy Yemen, but it’s un-American to close the door for 120 days. “Experts” tell us that Trump’s executive order strengthens recruiters for ISIS, yet many of these same experts have little to say about the recruiting power of 30,000 annual drone strikes. We’re told that closing our door is dangerous, but we’re never offered evidence of it. Do welcoming countries have fewer problems with terrorism than non-welcoming countries? Probably not. But you’re not encouraged to ask. As with so much that touches on Trump, the inclination to change how we do things can be defensible. Our refugee policies could indeed use reform—from the way we vet to the way we settle those we admit. Our record on asylum, which is related but different, has even more failures. (Let’s not forget the family of Dzokhar Tsarnaev .) With non-refugee immigration, we have almost no vetting at all. There’s no reason we shouldn’t have an office to review past mistakes in selection and improve it for the future, just as the Department of Transportation has for every accident in air travel, with astonishing improvements in safety. But the approach that Trump takes—erratic, clumsy, brutal—makes all these ideas look terrible. That’s the hell of it. At least we don’t have to dwell on it, since a few hours have already gone by. It’s old news. 1 / 21 Photos: The Fight to Help Refugees in Lesbos An Afghan refugee wrapped in a thermal blanket as he arrives on the shores of Lesbos in freezing conditions. January 22, 2016.

He decided to head to Lesbos after seeing the photo of Aylan Kurdi’s body on the beach, a three-year-old Syrian refugee who drowned while his family was making the dangerous crossing from Turkey to Greece. As a sea captain, he said it wasn’t enough to drive rich people around the world in yachts, but instead he wanted to use his skills to help the thousands of people risking their lives on the sea to make it to Europe.
