He marks the fifth generation of… more Joanne S. Lawton There are few stories of the history of Burke & Herbert Bank that haven’t been told. Over the course of the Northern Virginia bank’s 165 years, stories have aged into legend and community lore. Newspaper features and self-published books chronicle hand-me-down tales of surviving the Civil War and the Great Depression. Stories of parrots in the board room and Robert E. Lee family papers hidden in the vault. Hunt Burke became CEO of Burke & Herbert Bank in 2009. He marks the fifth generation of… more Joanne S. Lawton Burke & Herbert Bank remains a stalwart in Alexandria, outlasting many of its contemporaries and becoming the oldest bank in the state of Virginia. It’s stayed in the family, too, with current Chairman and CEO Hunt Burke serving as the fifth generation of the Burke family to lead the institution. Hunt’s great-great grandfather, John Burke, founded the bank with a handshake more than a century and a half ago. Hunt, 59, knows the story well. It was 1852. Democrat Franklin Pierce campaigned to succeed Millard Fillmore as president, and the ink on the first copies of “ Uncle Tom ’s Cabin” was still damp. Gold reigned in California, and in Alexandria, citizens were still adjusting to becoming Virginians again. The port city, once a part of the District of Columbia, was returned to the state just six years prior. On the banks of the Potomac, the city’s warehouses and manufacturing plants pulsed with steady business. Three blocks from the buzz, John, 27, and his friend Arthur Herbert , 23, saw opportunity. “It was a partnership. There were no papers,” Hunt said. “We still like to think we behave that way today. A handshake means a good deal.” Of course, deals now require a little more documentation. Change may take a snail’s pace at Burke & Herbert, but it arrives just the same. Today, it remains one of the Washington region’s largest banking operations with nearly $3 billion in assets and more than 1 percent market share. “If you say we’ve been here for 165 years, the correct response should be, ‘Who cares?’” Hunt said. “The important thing is, we know what we’re doing, we have a lot of capital, we’re very safe and we’re thinking about the future. If we weren’t, the bank should be left to die a natural death.” The history But plenty of people care about those 165 years. Both the Burke family and the bank hold a dizzying number of ties to big Washington names. According to a pamphlet chronicling the bank’s history during its centennial in 1952, founder John Burke’s second wife, Martha Jefferson Trist, was the great-granddaughter of Thomas Jefferson and the last of the family to be born at Monticello. Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee ’s daughter, Mary Custis Lee, stored two steamer trunks full of family documents in the bank’s vault after the Civil War. Even George Washington himself is connected — the Mount Vernon Ladies Association, caretakers of Washington’s estate since 1858, is a dedicated customer, as were members of the Washington family. After the $200,000 sale of the estate in 1858, the Washington family deposited the proceeds with Burke & Herbert. “That was on the eve of the Civil War,” Hunt said. “When the Union troops came to town, they came to the bank to seize whatever assets were there.” And that included the Washingtons’ money. Or so the soldiers thought. “My great-grandfather had hidden the money at his house on Wolfe Street. So, the Union searched the entire house until they got to his wife’s wardrobe,” Hunt said. The soldiers declined to search the Mrs. Burke’s personal space. “Well, of course that’s where the money was.” The next day, the Burkes gave the money to a friend, who hid the deposit in her egg basket and drove it across Union lines to a Washington bank. Burke & Herbert reopened after the war, moving into its current home at King and Fairfax streets in 1871. A few decades later, the bank reached the brink of closure again, as the stock market crash of 1929 led into the Great Depression, wreaking havoc on the banking industry. It was only after a well-timed, large deposit from an Alexandria family that the bank was able to stay afloat. The story still makes Hunt tear up, no matter how many times he’s recounted the details. The generations Hunt grew up spending weekends at the bank when his father, Chairman and CEO C.S. Taylor Burke Jr., put in extra hours. Hunt and his four siblings would run through the echoing maze of hallways, vaults and offices. The bank’s boardroom today looks much the same as it did then, with Taylor Burke Jr.’s gong — more attention-grabbing than a gavel — resting on the behemoth wooden table. Around the room, framed portraits of generations of bank presidents and board members look on, the faces bearing a preternatural resemblance to the moustached bankers who encourage Michael to save his tuppence in Disney’s “Mary Poppins.” Hunt has followed in his ancestor’s facial hair footsteps. His mustache, curled slightly at the ends, has become a signature. “I have shaved a few times over the years,” Hunt said. “Nobody knew me. Being incognito in your own block can be a lot of fun.” After decades working his way through the ranks, Hunt was named CEO of the bank in 2009, chairman in 2010. “I had all kinds of thoughts about what else I could do, where I could go in the world,” Hunt said. “I started working here to make enough money to figure out what the next thing was. But I started liking it.” Hunt describes working for his father as one of the toughest challenges he’s faced in the office. “There were more questions in the background than what was actually going on the surface,” Hunt said. “It was, ‘Am I doing OK? Is my dad proud of me?’” He got to watch as his father solidified his reputation as a quirky local character. A 1991 “Saturday Night Live” sketch showed a photo of Taylor Jr. testifying in Congress with his pet parrot — a popular attraction at the office — on his shoulder “The photos went viral before things even went viral,” said Jeff Stryker, senior executive vice president and cashier at Burke & Herbert. “Big Taylor was a terrific leader. Everybody gave him the best they had.” He was also known as a lender willing to give business owners a shot, Hunt said. Hugh Heishman, former member of the board at Burke & Herbert, remembers a time in the mid-1950s when Taylor Jr. took a chance on him. Heishman was hoping to start a local Volkswagen dealership, but was worried that he couldn’t secure a loan. “They stepped up and made the funds available. I’ve had a successful life as a result of their generosity, and 80 to 100 employees were given jobs,” said Heishman, now retired. “I really wasn’t financially qualified, and I’m the first to admit that.” Burke & Herbert has held on to success, in part, because of how much hasn’t changed as the bank was handed down from generation to generation. There was a certain charm to being among the last banks to use names rather than account numbers on checks, or to add computers to the office. “We’re not pioneers,” Taylor Jr. told The Washington Post in 1998. “Older people like our old-fashioned ways.” The future At a time when mergers and acquisitions have dramatically reduced the number of local banks in Greater Washington, Burke & Herbert Bank’s long, family-owned history is unique. In all, consolidation had reduced the number of banks headquartered in Greater Washington from 70 in 1999 to just 36 in 2016. Through all of that, Burke & Herbert has maintained its status thanks to what Hunt Burke calls the “sweet spot.” The bank may be a community bank in the era of big banking, but with some $3 billion in assets, it’s hardly small. “It’s regulations that just crush the smaller banks,” Hunt said. “We’re at a size where we have the income and assets that if something does come up, we can address it. I can’t imagine how a bank half our size could find the resources to meet challenges. I suppose that’s why a lot of banks merge.” But while the bank’s ability to stay the course may be a positive for longtime customers, Lew Sosnowik, a former banking analyst at Koonce Securities Inc., said that family-owned banks can sometimes struggle to draw investors. “From an investor’s point of view, in addition to wanting the growth and wanting the proper bottom line, if the investor feels the bank can’t grow for whatever reason, they would want to see the bank being sold, or being merged,” Sosnowik said. He said Burke & Herbert’s lengthy family-owned status is “quite unusual” in the industry, and that the bank maintains a good reputation in the region, despite not being as aggressive as some competitors. “They’ve been conservative, which is fine, but it might make an investor say, ‘Well, they’re too conservative,’” he said. But so far, Hunt says shareholders feel like members of a club, with share values remaining fairly steady and avoiding significant swings that Hunt says he has seen in other banks. “We consistently pay respectable dividends,” Hunt said. “We leave it up to investors to determine whether we fit into their asset goals.” The bank has managed to keep up with the local industry’s growth in the past decade for the most part, though its near-doubling of assets and deposits in the last decade pales in comparison to the roughly 130 percent growth at Access National Bank, 170 percent growth at Cardinal Bank and the head-spinning 900-some percent growth at WashingtonFirst Bank in that time. Part of the reason for those banks swelling so fast? Acquisitions, which Burke & Herbert hasn’t ventured into as much its peers. Burke & Herbert has also seen a fairly unblemished record with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. In 2014, the bank made a consent agreement with the FDIC to develop new procedures to guard against money laundering in accordance with the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act. At the time, bank President and COO Scott McSween said it was the first time the FDIC had taken such action against the bank. Hunt sees a more progressive future for the bank that’s been left in his care. Although his four adult daughters have not given a solid promise to follow in their father’s footsteps, Hunt said there’s still a possibility that one will return to take up the mantle. But even if leadership falls out of the Burke family name for a time, family members — including Hunt’s brother, James M. Burke — will likely retain their holdings and positions on the bank’s board. “I’m looking at who can be running the bank for the next generation,” Hunt said. “Even if my kids come along, there’s a gap there of 20 years or so that we’d need to have good people in line, and we do.” No one can measure how essential having a Burke maintain a leadership position has been on the reputation of the bank, but Joe Collum, senior vice president at the bank, said that the family lineage is what has set it apart. “It’s very rare,” Collum said. “The family has been very accessible, known in the community.” For now, the bank is pushing forward with online banking, embracing the 20- and 30-somethings who no longer do their banking in person. They’re also working toward more diversity on the board of directors. The pictures on the wall around that conference table now includes a woman, and the Burkes enforce a 75-and-out rule, rotating members off the board once they celebrate their 75th birthday. Most of all, Hunt is focused on reminding customers that nothing can stay the same forever. Not even the neighborhood bank. “Never say, ‘We’ve always done it that way,’” he said. “That’s a killer.” A closer look Leadership: Hunt Burke, chairman and CEO; Scott McSween, president and chief operating officer Current assets: $2.92 billion", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:16:34.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
