(Photo: Greg M. Cooper, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNew England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski had some advice for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell: \nThink twice before attending a game in Foxborough. \n“The fans are nuts, they’re wild, and they have the Patriots’ back no matter what. They have Tom’s back,\" Gronkowski said in an interview with ESPN. \"I’m telling you, he won’t get through the highway if the fans saw him. I don’t even think he can even land in the airport in Boston because Patriot fans are the best fans, they’re the most loyal fans. I’m telling you, they might just carry out Roger themselves. They couldn’t even get to the stadium in Foxborough if he landed in Boston.” \nThe interview can be seen here. \nGoodell, who has not attended a game in Foxborough since the 2014 AFC Championship Game --- the game that started Deflategate -- said at the Super Bowl he would be ok with attending a game in Foxborough if invited. \nPatriots owner Robert Kraft said before the Super Bowl that if the Patriots won, next year's season opener would be the \"perfect opportunity\" for Goodell to attend a game in Foxborough. \nThe Super Bowl champions traditionally open the NFL season on a Thursday night at home.
