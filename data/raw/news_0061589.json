The skin on the abdomen was missing and internal body parts and bloodstains were scattered across the room,” the police officer said. \nNazim was sitting near the corpse and surrendered to the police without any resistance, he added. \nLocals enraged by the murder and cannibalism, manhandled Nazim in front of senior police officials before they intervened to save him. \nBased on the complaint lodged by the Monis’s father, police registered an FIR against Nazim under Section 302 (murder), Section 341 (wrongful restraint), 362 (abduction) and other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). \nOn Wednesday, the accused was presented in a court in Pilibhit which sent him to judicial custody. “We will try to complete the investigation of the case and submit the final charge sheet in court,” said the SP.
