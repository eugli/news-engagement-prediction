A committee of MPs described the situation as a public health emergency. The Government is expected to publish a strategy to tackle the issue in the coming weeks. It is likely to include low emission zones in cities. Drivers of older diesels would face charges. Tax rises are also being considered, as are incentives to switch to hybrid and electric vehicles. Ministers have not ruled out a scrappage scheme, which would pay drivers to ditch older diesels. Any such measures are likely to be targeted tightly at commercial drivers and the poor. The Royal College of Physicians and of Paediatrics and Child Health warned last year that air pollution was contributing to about 40,000 deaths a year (file photo) Sadiq Khan has already announced plans to introduce a £10-a-day ‘toxicity charge’ on older, polluting cars entering central London on weekdays from October. The city’s mayor has warned driving could even be banned altogether on certain days to help bring air pollution below legal limits. Department for Transport sources last night stressed that Mr Grayling was not telling people to stop buying diesel cars, but urging them to consider whether a less polluting vehicle might suit their needs. A source pointed out that ministers have already announced incentives for electric car purchases and are investing heavily in a nationwide charging network. Mr Grayling said previous governments had encouraged diesel cars for ‘understandable reasons’, but added: ‘We have now learned much more about the health impact of NOx emissions and it’s clearly not an issue we can now ignore.’ But one motoring campaigner claimed Mr Grayling was being irresponsible. Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK, said: ‘Motorists are being penalised for driving diesel cars after being encouraged to buy them by previous governments. It is irresponsible of a minister to be telling people what cars they should be buying and devaluing the diesel market.’ Mr Grayling said previous governments had encouraged diesel cars for ‘understandable reasons (file photo) Almost half of new cars sold last year were diesel and sales of older second-hand diesels, which emit higher levels of dangerous pollutants, are shooting up. Despite the pollution warnings, and the VW emissions scandal, sales of new diesels edged up by 0.6 per cent to 1.29million last year. Charlie Elphicke, a Tory MP and chairman of the cross party FairfuelUK group, said: ‘Diesel drivers are being unfairly demonised, particularly those with older cars. ‘Pollution is a serious problem. Yet incredible progress has been made in the past decade – nitrogen oxide emissions have halved, while particulates are well down. ‘Nowadays, the emission standards for new diesel cars are as tough as new petrol cars. So it would be a mistake to think the pollution problem can be solved simply by going from diesel to petrol.’ Recent estimates from the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory show diesel cars account for 11 per cent of nitrogen oxide emissions, less than ‘non road mobile machinery’ such as bulldozers and diggers which account for 14 per cent. Trains and buses account for 16 per cent in total. In an effort to meet emissions targets agreed at the Kyoto Summit, Labour’s Gordon Brown introduced a 3p cut in fuel duty for modern low sulphur diesel engines in his March 2001 budget. Changes in road tax also initially favoured diesel cars. But as engines have generally become more fuel efficient they no longer enjoy the same tax advantages.
