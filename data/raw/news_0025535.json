Hundreds of likes enable Facebook to build a very detailed profile. Photo: Liberal, Labor and Greens are all using Facebook advertising as part of their WA election strategies.

'Dark posts' invisible to everyone except the target group \nPreviously, political campaigns have centred on newspapers advertisements, TV and radio ads and letterbox drops. \nBut Facebook also uses \"dark posts\" which can only be viewed by a target audience. \nFor posts to be targeted, they have to be paid for as \"boosted\" posts in a user's news feed, and Facebook is increasingly prioritising this in a bid to increase its revenue stream. \n\"You can say I would like to get a message to 18 to 25-year-olds who live in Ellenbrook who are concerned about the lack of transport. It won't appear on the website, it's going to appear only their own Facebook feeds,\" Ms Callaghan said. \n\"That makes it very hard for the outside world to judge the impact and extent of how this takes place.\" \nBut Ms Callaghan said \"dark posts\" could also be risky. \n\"When you start to choose a group based on issues such as \"I don't like a particular ethnic group\", you can have some dangerous racially driven micro-messaging taking place,\" she said. \n\"There are quite a lot of anti-Islamic groups that are active at the moment, their messaging is not going to be seen by the broader population.\" \nMany of the darker posts are not coming from the major parties but from interest groups that are aligned to the parties — meaning you might be seeing a very different stream of information on Facebook from someone with differing political views. \n\"There are an increasing number of people who only see what Facebook presents to them and Facebook is under no obligation to give you a balanced position,\" Ms Callaghan said.

(Supplied: WA Labor) Call centres increasingly irrelevant \nIn 2016, 15 million Australians were on Facebook, with the average Australian user logging on to the site 32 times a week. \nAbout a third of all users, and half of those aged 30-39, say they get their news from social media, and at the same time many people are disconnecting their land lines, or simply do not answer unknown numbers. \nAs a result, Ms Callaghan believes voter phone call centres are becoming increasingly irrelevant. \n\"What is much more effective is if you can get an SMS out to the public. We saw that in the federal election with Labor's use of the Medicare campaign. It is effective, it feels personalised and it comes straight to the person,\" she said. \nThe WA Greens are training their volunteers to have persuasive online conversations. \nCampaign manager Andrew Beaton said it was the same principle as door knocking without the constraints of distance. \n\"It can be as simple as we provide a banner image or profile image and that can engage people in conversation, or if they want they can talk to people on their wall, and talk to people in community groups online,\" he said. \n\"It also gives people the opportunity to check in with us if they need help.\" \nMr Beaton said door knocking and phone calls would remain an important part of the party's strategy, but social media was equally vital in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:24:20.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
