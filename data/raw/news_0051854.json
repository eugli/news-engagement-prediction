(Facebook: Glenn Dickson) \nMr Noble said Mr Dickson's case was listed as critical but stable following surgery at Cairns Hospital. \n\"In the short term he's doing well and we just hope he will continue to improve,\" he said. \nA crowdfunding venture to assist Mr Dickson with his recovery has already raised more than $8,000 towards its $20,000 goal. \nMr Dickson was bitten by what is believed to have been either a bull shark or a tiger shark.
