Oof. \nVideo: Johnny Makes A Surprise Appearance! \nAs you may recall, earlier in January, the Pirates Of The Caribbean actor sued The Management Group after his new business manager discovered the serious misconduct the money handlers executed while they worked for him between 1999 and 2016. According to Depp's lawsuit, TMG collected $28 million in unauthorized contingent fees, never properly filed his taxes on time, AND loaned around $10 million of his money to third parties — WITHOUT his approval. Oh man. \nThe company's attorneys, Joel and Robert Mandel (who are also being sued), have clapped back at the industry vet as they defended that they did everything in their power to properly handle Johnny's money. According to them, they regularly warned Amber Heard 's ex that he was overspending. \nAll of this info was detailed in a cross-complaint filed by the Mandels on Tuesday in the Los Angeles County Superior Court . The twosome's legal counsel, Michael Kump , wrote in the filed document: \n\"Depp lived an ultra-extravagant lifestyle that often knowingly cost Depp in excess of $2 million per month to maintain, which he simply could not afford. Depp, and Depp alone, is fully responsible for any financial turmoil he finds himself in today.\" \nDAYU ! The company didn't stop there though as they also called out the Sweeney Todd star for spending $75 million on 14 various properties, $18 million on a luxury yacht, and $30K a month on wine alone. THAT IS SO MUCH MONEY SPENT ON WINE! \nApparently, TMG is suing their former client for breach of contract and fraud and they want the court to rule that \"Depp is responsible for his own financial waste.\" Snap! Snap! \nDepp's attorney Matthew Kanny has yet to comment on the update. \nWhat do YOU think? Are you shocked about Johnny's excessive spending? \nSOUND OFF in the comments ( below )! \n[ Image via Kento Nara/Future Image / WENN . ] Worst Dressed Celebs Of The Week!
