He played Johnny Dio in “Goodfellas” and acted in “Cop Land,”“Mickey Blue Eyes” and several TV shows. \nDietl, a former NYPD detective and New York mayoral hopeful, said of Pellegrino and his restaurant, “Rao’s may be over 100 years old, but the person who made Rao’s what it is was Frankie. It is a place that is so unique because of him and it not going to be the same without him. He was big-hearted and generous and always took care of people. What a shining star and a big personality, I will miss singing along with him every Thursday night.” \nPellegrino was diagnosed with cancer last year but still made appearances at his restaurant, which is famously a haunt for many celebrities, including Woody Allen and Leonardo DiCaprio. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
