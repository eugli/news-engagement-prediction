You ok ? Don‚Äôt be scaring us like this .. üèà‚Äù \nTo which Brady replied, ‚ÄúHahaha yeah all good just my left shoulder which isn‚Äôt very important to me anyway hahaha.‚Äù David Beckham speaking for all #Patriots backers after Brady ski jump vid pic.twitter.com/EbURQriZpo \n‚Äî Tim Whelan Jr. (@thattimwhelan) February 23, 2017 \nBrady did recently say he wanted to go back to his pranking ways , but many believed he would be pulling practical jokes on teammates, not on his fans. \nOr maybe Brady really did injure his shoulder in the fall. If so, he does have plenty of time to get back to 100 percent. \nPatriots fans freaked out when they saw the video. Brady takes incredible care of his body, so it‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôd be on the slopes if he believed he could seriously injure himself. The guy wears special pajamas and doesn‚Äôt eat strawberries to make himself a better quarterback. It‚Äôs probably best to trust he knows what he‚Äôs doing. \nThumbnail photo via Greg M.
