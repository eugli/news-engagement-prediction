Its only purpose is to take a long list of elements inside a single container and spread them out across several ‘pages’. It’s different to some of our other plugins as it does the sorting/pagination directly on the content without you having to adjust anything. This might be beneficial but also means you’ll need to customize it more if that doesn’t suit your needs. \nNote : Being an older library there are a few concerns: The demo may throw an unsafe script error. This is because the demo page is requesting a resource over HTTP instead of HTTPS. When the script loads it works just fine (just be aware of the warning). You’ll need to stick to jQuery 1xx or 2xx as the 3xx branch of jQuery has removed functionality the library depended on. Any of the first two works fine. \nYou’ll need to download the jQuery Pajinate script from its GitHub page and include it with your project (along with jQuery). Once you have those two elements you can set up the paginator by calling the pajinate() method. \nBy default, the plugin will look for certain elements in order to initialize. Pajinate will try to find an element where it will append its navigation elements, by default looking for the page_navigation element. It also expects to find another element inside which will contain the content, by default looking for the content element. These can be changed and set as properties when calling pajinate . \nHere’s a basic example of how the markup should appear <div id=\"page_container\"><div class=\"page_navigation\"></div><ul class=\"content\"><li><p>One</p></li><li><p>Two</p></li><li><p>Three</p></li><li><p>Four</p></li><li><p>Five</p></li><li><p>Six</p></li><li><p>Seven</p></li><li><p>Eight</p></li></ul></div> \nAlong with the corresponding JS $('#page_container9').pajinate({ num_page_links_to_display : 3, items_per_page : 6, wrap_around: true, show_first_last: false }); \nThere are several other useful properties you can also set, such as the number of items to display and labels for the controls. The documentation at the bottom of their GitHub page outlines the properties you can adjust. \nOverall, it’s an older plugin that hasn’t been updated for several years (since 2013). It works well on older versions of jQuery and because of that its place should be for legacy site builds (where you know you’ll be stuck on an old jQuery version but you still need to add certain functionality).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:34:27.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
