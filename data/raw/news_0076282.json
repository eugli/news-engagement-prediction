We’ll even throw in a counter when you get around to signing our deal. We’ve got government backing to stage the event, but you need to be focused on boxing.”\nThe entertaining video is spliced with clips of United States President Donald Trump and shots of Brisbane.\nBut it has proven useless in the end, as Pacquiao now moves to a showdown in the Middle East with Khan.\nPac-man keeping his distance 0:31 Boxing: Manny Pacquiao looks to have no intentions of fighting Jeff Horn after another tweet saying he will fight Amir Khan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T06:02:12.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
