The government has expressed confidence that the cleaning operation will be finished in a couple of days. The Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is providing special bio-remediation material for treatment of the collected oil sludge for safe disposal. “The total quantity of sludge which was removed till February 2 was 65 tonnes. It is observed that there is a vast difference between quantity of oil spilt and sludge recovered due to the fact that the oil gets coagulated and becomes puffy when it is recovered with water and sand,” an official release said.
