President Trump speaks at a rally Saturday in Melbourne, Fla. (Nicholas Kamm / AFP/Getty Images) \nPresident Trump ’s next national security advisor will serve as his eyes and ears to crises that pop up all over the globe — and be thrust into the center of the White House ’s biggest firestorms too. \nAmid the fallout over the firing of the first person to hold the post, Michael Flynn, the president has escalated his war with the media, questions have mounted about Trump associates’ ties to Russia, and his top pick to replace Flynn backed away, making it known he was concerned about how much autonomy he would have. \nFilling the job has emerged as a key early test of Trump and the dynamics within his White House, the subject of unprecedented scrutiny after a stormy first month. \nFour candidates to replace Flynn trekked Sunday to Trump’s weekend White House, his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, for in-person interviews: former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, West Point Supt. Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen, acting National Security Advisor Keith Kellogg and Army strategist Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. \nTrump told reporters a day earlier on Air Force One that he had a leading candidate among them. \nOthers could be added to the list, officials said, and candidates could return for follow-up interviews Monday. One name that had been floated, former CIA director David H. Petraeus , was ruled out. \n“I have many, many that want the job,” Trump insisted as he promised a decision within days. \nTrump maintained last week that his administration is functioning “smoothly” and like a “fine-tuned machine.” But the West Wing is battling incessant reports of internal strife at the highest levels, and questions about the outsize role being played by chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon. \nHe has been given a permanent seat on the National Security Council, which is the president’s principal forum for confronting national security and foreign policy issues and coordinating U.S. response among agencies. \nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said on NBC’s “Meet The Press” that he had concerns about the makeup of Trump’s National Security Council and whether it could be subject to political influence, and that others shared his view.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:31:15.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
