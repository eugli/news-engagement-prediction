The two cousins, who stay at a rented flat in south Delhi, had gone to Hauz Khas with friends on Saturday night. After dinner, around 1am, the two women were trying to hail a cab to return home when two men approached them. \n“We have detained six men and are questioning them. We hope to make the arrests soon,” an investigator said. \nThe police teams area recording statements of eyewitnesses in the case. “Our teams are speaking to vendors, parking attendants, security guards, who had seen the women walking with the two men. We have got crucial leads and an arrest will be made soon,” a police officer said. \nThe police have recovered the wallet of the victim from the spot where she was allegedly raped. A CCTV camera installed near the market has also captured the suspect’s friend chatting with the cousin, who went home leaving her sister behind. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:01:51.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
