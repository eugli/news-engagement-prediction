Efforts to extinguish the blaze are continuing. MICHAEL HODGSON \nThe blazing tornado was at least 50 metres tall, hidden under a mushroom cloud of smoke. \nThe tornado was spotted by aerial fire crews in the early days of the fire. \nFire response coordinator Richard McNamara has fought fires all over the world and said he had never seen anything like it. \nREAD MORE: * Behind the picture: Owner '100 per cent sure' Worsleys Rd house was gone 1 NEWS \nFire fighters work to extinguish hot spots in the Port Hills this week. \nHe said the blazing tornado was at least 50 metres tall, hidden \"under that big mushroom cloud\". \nFire behaviour scientist Grant Pearce said fire tornados, like the one seen in the Port Hills fire, were incredibly rare. He could think of few other instances of the tornados in New Zealand's history. \nThe flaming red whirls were present at the devastating fires in Chicago in 1877 and San Francisco in 1905 and were reported at Raetihi in 1919 and again at Taupo in 1946. \nPearce said the tornados behaved in much the same way as a wind tornado and picked up everything in their path, except at their core was a flaming inferno. They scooped up vegetation, whole logs and branches. Some had such power that grass blades became bullets, and could be catapulted into peoples doors. Ad Feedback \nHe said while it was relatively common for a small whirlwind to occur, usually on the perimeter of the fire, it was very unusual for it to escalate further than a tiny twister. \nAs the Port Hills blaze was an example of an \"extreme fire\", the conditions made for the perfect storm. \n\"You need an unstable atmosphere and something to get the circulation going. As hot air rises, it naturally rotates due to wind or variation in the amount of burning because different levels of activity within the fire cause updrafts and downdrafts\", he said. \n\"They usually occur in gullys or in the middle of a fire as it meets another.\" \nAs the hot air rises, cool air is sucked into a central hot spot and begins to spin, creating a vortex of flame. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:15:01.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
