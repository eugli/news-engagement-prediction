He was later arrested on corruption charges. Credit Kim Hee-Chul/European Pressphoto Agency SEOUL, South Korea — The de facto leader of Samsung, Lee Jae-yong, was arrested Friday on bribery charges, a dramatic turn in South Korea ’s decades-old struggle to end collusive ties between the government and powerful family-controlled conglomerates. Mr. Lee, the vice chairman of Samsung, one of the world’s largest conglomerates, was taken to a jail outside Seoul, the capital, soon after a judge at the Seoul Central District Court issued an arrest warrant early Friday. Mr. Lee, 48, was accused of paying $36 million in bribes to President Park Geun-hye’s secretive confidante, Choi Soon-sil, in return for political favors from Ms. Park, like government support for a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015 that helped Mr. Lee inherit corporate control from his incapacitated father, Chairman Lee Kun-hee. Mr. Lee is the first head of Samsung, a symbol of power and wealth in South Korea, to face corruption charges. Other charges against him include embezzlement, illegal transfer of property abroad and committing perjury during a parliamentary hearing. Analysts say his case is a litmus test of whether the country’s relatively youthful democracy and judicial system are ready to crack down on the white-collar crimes of family-owned conglomerates, or chaebol, among which Samsung is the biggest and most profitable. \nAdvertisement His arrest is also a hard-won victory for the special prosecutor, Park Young-soo, who has been struggling to establish a bribery case against Mr. Lee and Ms. Park.
