Although the project brought back almost the entire star-studded, Emma Thompson was not present. \nThompson explained, while doing press for “Beauty and the Beast” that it was “too soon” since the death of her counterpart in the film, Alan Rickman . For that reason, Curtis was unable to write her a part. \nRickman played Thompson’s adulterous husband, Harry, in the 2003 film. The rest of the ensemble cast includes Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth and Keira Knightley.

It’s absolutely right because it’s supposed to be for Comic Relief but there isn’t much comic relief in the loss of our dear friend, really, just over a year ago.” \nRickman died in January 2016 after battling cancer. Thompson penned a tribute to Rickman after his death, calling him “the ultimate ally… In life, art and politics.” She added, “He was, above all things, a rare and unique human being and we shall not see his like again.” Filed Under: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:07:25.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
