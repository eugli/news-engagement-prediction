No politicians, straight street guys, they’re going to commit to lower body count and we’re going to come in with some social programs.” \nMr. Trump said, “If they’re not going to solve the problem, and what you’re doing is the right thing, then we’re going to solve the problem for them.” \nMr. Scott replied, “They believe in this administration. They want to work with this administration. They didn’t believe in the prior administration.” \nThe president said February is a time to “honor the tremendous history of African Americans throughout the country.” He said his administration’s efforts, led in part by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, will improve living conditions for minorities. \n“We’re going to need better schools, and we need them soon,” Mr. Trump said. “We need more jobs, we need better wages. We’re going to work very hard in the inner cities. We need safer communities, and we’re going to do that with law enforcement. We’re going to make it much better than it is right now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T19:06:42.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
