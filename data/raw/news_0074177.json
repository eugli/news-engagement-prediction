Kurt Busch's NASCAR highs and lows Updated February 26, 2017 7:39 PM By JOSH STEWART Advertise here Kurt Busch, the 2004 NASCAR Cup champion, won his first Daytona 500 on Feb. 26, 2017. It was by far his biggest victory since 2015, when he was suspended to start the season based on domestic violence claims levied by former girlfriend Patricia Driscoll. He denied the accusation and even said Driscoll is a trained assassin. A family court decision in Delaware that ruled a domestic violence event occurred prompted the suspension, but a subsequent attorney general's office decision not to pursue criminal charges against Busch helped pave the way for the driver's return. This is par for the course for Busch, whose career has been a mixed bag of celebrations and setbacks.
