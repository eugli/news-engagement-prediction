It’s just so overwhelming,” Patel said after accepting the trophy from Felicity Jones. Patel thanked his parents and his team, saying, “This is a film about family, about love that transcends borders, race, colour and anything. You guys are my driving force.”\nHe got a resounding applaud as he mentioned Pawar, who plays the younger Saroo in the movie. “I’d like to thank little Sunny Pawar, who did this film with such confidence. He truly is a star. Garth Davis, an incredible director who is going to be a friend of mine for life and to my amazing team who had the insane task of trying to get this Indian dude with this noodle with wanky teeth and fluffy hair work in this really hard industry. To you guys, you are my heroes. I’m so grateful.”\nAlso Read | BAFTA 2017: La La Land, Dev Patel win at British Academy Film Awards\nPatel, who rose to global stardom with his debut feature Slumdog Millionaire, is also nominated for an Oscar this year for Lion which many call his most incredible performance till date.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/0WJFj_1l4mU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WJFj_1l4mU"], "published": "2017-02-13T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:21:24.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
