By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 27, 2017 3:54 PM Madras High Court. (PTI) \nThe Madras High Court bench consisting of acting chief justice Huluvadi Ramesh and Justice R Mahadevan has issued a notice to the Tamil Nadu CM and Home secretary over the DMK plea and have asked them to file counter affidavit by March 10. DMK’s plea seeking to declare Palanisami’s trust vote as null and void came up before the Madras High Court today. As we all know, Palanisamy won the trust vote in the Tamil Nadu state assembly, which, according to reports, was helped by DMK’s eviction during the vote and walk out of its allies. \nFollowing this, MK Stalin moved Madras High Court with a plea that sought to stay the Speaker’s announcement declaring E Palanisamy as having proved the majority in the state assembly. \nA contention raised by MK Stalin is that the Speaker had a biased approach that was influenced by Palanisamy or else he should not have carried on with the floor test with ”captured” MLAs. He further contended that the Speaker held this floor test in an undemocratic manner that ignored parliamentary procedures. \nOn the day of the trust vote, TV channels had shown us images of MK Stalin emerging out of the Assembly with his shirt undone after he was evicted from the House. Then he immediately dashed off to the Raj Bhavan to meet the Governor and complain about what had happened during the trust vote. \nNot just that, Stalin has not let this episode rest or be forgotten so easily. He termed these events as ”the murder of democracy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:45:23.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
