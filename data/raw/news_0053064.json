They say focusing on what you want attracts it into your life. \nI don't practice LOA, but I believe the Perfect Day exercise has practical use: It gives you a clear picture, a clear vision of what matters to you. And that gives you the discipline to stick with it. \nMost people think discipline is having the willpower to force yourself to do something you don't want to do. That's not what discipline is. \nDiscipline is about having the presence of mind to choose what you want over what you feel like doing. If this is something you want, then you'll take small steps to make your life a little bit more like your Perfect Day every day. \nAs you go about designing your Perfect Day, keep the following in mind: 1. Your perfect day will change as the circumstances of your life change. \nI have two children below two years old, so my Perfect Day today is very different than what it was before they were born. Now it involves getting up early, around 5 am, so I have some quiet time to myself before anyone else wakes up. \nThen my kids wake up and I play with them and get them ready for daycare. By 8:30 am, I'm off to my office, which is literally across the backyard. \nI keep my mornings free because I'm most present and engaged with work that requires thinking, imagination, and creativity in the morning. At some point, I'll head to my favorite cafe around the corner for breakfast. \nIn the afternoon, I do work that involves other people. I get on calls with clients and partners and with people on my team. My team is spread all over the world, so there's a lot of video calls and Skype calls. I wrap up by 5, get some exercise, get home, and hang out with my kids. 2. Your perfect day is yours and won't look like somebody else's. \nEveryone's perfect day doesn't look the same. Some people love to travel. Some people love adventure sports. Some people are in a different stage of life. They don't have small children; they have a different rhythm. \nYour perfect day doesn't have to look like mine, but you do have to be intentional about creating yours. 3. It doesn't mean having the same day, every day. \nThere's some variability in my Perfect Day. I'm not always at home. Sometimes I travel, attending conferences, speaking on stages, getting out into the world and meeting people. \nThis is where being able to design the life you want is great. It means so much to me that when I travel, my wife and daughter can usually come along. I'm not on the road by myself, away from my family for a week at a time. They can be there with me. \nBetween meetings, I can take a break and take my daughter for a walk on the beach in San Diego or explore downtown Austin. Wherever I am, I can do things with my family. \nDesigning your perfect day isn't about locking yourself into a routine that may not serve you all the time. It's about having the flexibility so wherever you are, things play out in a way that is aligned with what matters to you. 4. It doesn't mean having a perfect life. \nHaving a perfect day doesn't mean your life is perfect. We all have problems. Things come up that we can't control and require our attention, throw a wrench into the most perfect thing that might be working. \nWe tend to overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do in a year . We work at this for a day, two days, three days, and our lives aren't perfect yet. \nThat discourages some people, but if you can do for a year what others won't, then you can live your life the way most people can't. In a year, you can make your life look much closer to the way you want it to look.
