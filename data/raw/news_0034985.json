Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was allegedly killed by two women who splashed his face with a chemical at the KL International Airport 2 departure hall at about 9am on Monday. He was about to leave for Macau.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:55:48.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
