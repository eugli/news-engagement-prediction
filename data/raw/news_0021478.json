Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThis hilarious letter of complaint was sent to parents after a ten-year-old schoolboy invented an imaginary playground friend - called 'Wildo the Dildo'. \nStunned Paul Hunt, 38, was in stitches when the note came home in his partner's ten-year-old son's school bag. \nThe lad and his pals had apparently been called over for a \"discussion\" with teachers who overheard the name Wildo the Dildo used during their playtime games. \nBut Paul and his partner, from Taunton, Somerset, couldn't believe the school had sent home a letter about the \"inappropriate word\". \nThe letter said: \"Although this is not a behaviour letter as such, I am writing to inform you of something that has come to our attention and that you may wish to discuss further with [the boy]. (Photo: SWNS) \n\"Him and a few of his friends often make up characters, give them amusing names and then they have exciting adventures at playtimes. \n\"This in itself is an imaginative and creative pastime and causes no harm. \n\"However, it has come to our attention that one of the characters has the name 'Wildo the Dildo' and this has, I am sure you can understand, raised some concerns with us. \n\"On further discussion, none of the children said they knew what it meant, but were aware that it was an inappropriate word to be using. \n\"One of the children said they picked up the word on the playground, so we will be following this up further and dealing with accordingly. \n\"I hope you can appreciate the reason I am informing you of this matter and please do not hesitate to contact me if you wish to discuss it further.\" \nAfter getting the letter on Tuesday, Paul posted it on Twitter with the message \"the funniest thing I've ever read\" - where it was shared or liked nearly 10,000 times. \nHe said the lad - who he didn't want to name - had no idea what the word meant and had told them about the teacher's worries before the letter came home.
