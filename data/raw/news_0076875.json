A copy of the tweet was also kept by Google and available through a cache page.\nPwC declined comment on Monday about whether Mr Cullinan's social media use may have distracted him, the Associated Press reported.\nThe Journal also quoted \"a person familiar with the matter\" saying that Mr Cullinan was turned down when he had sought permission to post to social media during the show.\nWatch | Moonlight wins Best Picture after La La Land mistakenly named winner 02:06 M r Cullinan posted other photos on Twitter during the awards show that were also apparently deleted, the Journal quoted a \"person with knowledge of the matter\" as saying.\n“This was our issue.

He added that Mr Cullinan said he feels “horrible, absolutely horrible”.\nThe accounting firm said on Monday that its staffers did not move quickly enough to correct the mistaken announcement of the best picture winner.\nThree of the film's producers spoke before the actual winner, the coming-of-age drama Moonlight, was announced.\nIt took three hours for PwC, which has been overseeing Academy Awards balloting for 83 years, initially to confirm that Beatty and Dunaway received the wrong category envelope.\n\"PwC takes full responsibility for the series of mistakes and breaches of established protocols during last night's Oscars,\" PwC wrote. It said that Mr Cullinan mistakenly handed presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway an envelope containing the winner of the best actress award.\nThere are very few people who know the Oscar winners before Oscar Sunday.

We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.\"\nAs per protocol, Mr Cullinan and PwC colleague Martha Ruiz toted briefcases to the awards via the red carpet, each holding an identical set of envelopes for the show's 24 categories. The accountants also memorise the winners.\nDuring the telecast, the accountants were stationed in the Dolby Theatre wings, one stage left and one stage right, to give presenters their category's envelope before they went on stage. Most presenters entered stage right, where Mr Cullinan was posted and where he handed Beatty and Dunaway the errant envelope.\n#TBThursday - 87th Oscars Red Carpet.

That left a duplicate, unopened envelope for best actress at stage right.\n\"It's a simple process, if a painstaking one,\" said Dan Lyle, who had Oscar duties for Price Waterhouse for 11 years in the 1980s and '90s. Accountants attended rehearsals to learn whether presenters would enter from the right or left. But given the possibility of last-minute changes, both accountants had a full set of envelopes.\nThe accountancy firm had previously boasted that their 83-year contract had never come up for tender because they \"always\" do a good job, it has emerged.\nThe Academy is also reviewing the entire backstage process and PwC’s role in it, according to another person familiar with the matter, the Journal reported.\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the Oscars, also apologised for the mishap and said it was committed to upholding the integrity of the Oscars.\n\"We have spent last night and today investigating the circumstances, and will determine what actions are appropriate going forward,\" it said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T10:33:39.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
