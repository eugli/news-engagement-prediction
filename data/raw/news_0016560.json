(IE photo) \nIn a dramatic turn of events, new Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) administrators have closed offices of President and Secretary of the board. It has been learned that officials associated with the two offices were sacked. \nAfter being appointed as the administrators of the BCCI by the Supreme Court, three of the panel members had their first meeting away from the BCCIs headquarters in South Mumbai. Vinod Rai, former Comptroller and Auditor General of India, former India womens captain Diana Edulji and banker Vikram Limaye were present at the meeting held at the IDFC Banks premises in suburban BKC. However, the fourth administrator – noted historian Ramachandra Guha – was not present. \nYou may also like to watch \nRai, who heads the committee, told waiting reporters it was a “familiarisation meeting” before going in. Yesterday the apex court had appointed the four-member committee of administrators (COA) to run the affairs of the BCCI and implement court-approved recommendations of the Justice R M Lodha panel on reforms in the cash-rich cricket body. The court had ruled that BCCIs CEO, Rahul Johri, would report to this body of administrators. “We just had a familiarisation meeting just to get ourselves briefed with the functioning of BCCI, we have finished that. Soon we will decide on the course of action,” Rai said after the meeting.
