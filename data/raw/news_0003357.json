counter-extremism programme by moving it to focus exclusively on Islamist terrorism.\nAmerican officials briefed on the proposed changes told Reuters the Countering Violent Extremism (DVE) initiative could be renamed to “Countering Radical Islamic Extremism”.\nThe reclassification would remove its work combating far-right attacks and mass shootings, such as the massacre of black churchgoers in Charleston , which are rarely classified as terrorism by American authorities. \nUSA: Hundreds march against racism in Charleston after church shooting “Violent extremist threats come from a range of groups and individuals, including domestic terrorists and homegrown violent extremists in the United States, as well as international terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and Isil (Isis),” reads the current description of CVE on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) website. \nRead more Trump calls refugees US agreed to resettle 'illegal immigrants' Mayor of Madrid compares Donald Trump to Hitler over immigration ban Donald Trump uses Black History Month speech to attack CNN But Mr Trump’s rhetoric has focused exclusively on the dangers of “radical Islam”, seeing him criticise Barack Obama for being “weak” on Isis .\nThe position sparked his executive order suspending the US refugee programme and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim “countries of concern”.\nThe President claimed the move would prevent “bad dudes” coming to the US, despite the fact countries linked to previous terror attacks were not on the list, as well as warnings the “Muslim ban” would fuel propaganda efforts by Isis and other jihadi groups.\nProponents of the existing CVE programme fear any move to rebrand it would make it more difficult for the government to work with Muslim counter-extremism groups already unsettled by Mr Trump’s policies and divisive statements.\nDylann Roof, the Charleston shooter, wrote a racist manifesto before massacring black churchgoers (AP) It aims to deter groups or potential lone attackers within the US through community partnerships and education and counter-messaging campaigns in cooperation with companies such as Google and Facebook, and is separate from military and intelligence efforts against online extremism.\nSome Republicans in Congress have accused the programme of being too “politically correct “and ineffective, claiming that that singling out Islamist extremism as the trigger for many violent attacks would help focus deterrence efforts.\nRead more A timeline of US mass shootings following the Orlando nightclub attack A source who has worked closely with the DGS told Reuters that members of the Trump transition team first met with a CVE task force in December and floated the idea of changing the name and focus.\nIn a meeting last Thursday attended by senior staff for DHS Secretary John Kelly, government employees were reportedly asked to defend why they chose certain community organisations as recipients of CVE grants.\nMr Kelly is reviewing the funding, which has been appropriated by Congress and the grant recipients including local authorities, police, universities and non-profit groups were notified in the final days of the Obama administration but has not yet been transferred.\nThe controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 10 show all The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 1/10 Trump
