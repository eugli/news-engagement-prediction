Realizing the high expense, he decided to take matters into his own hands and learn how to restore them himself.\nNow retired, Nash has immersed himself in the craft of colourizing and restoring old photographs, both for his own enjoyment and as a home business.\nUnknown dock worker in St. Johns circa 1950. (Twitter/@NLHistory)\nThrough his website thephotomender.com , Nash provides customers a chance to turn damaged black and white photos into vivid works of art.\nHe said the response has been great, and most people love his work. However, there are purists who say adding colour to old photos is disrespectful to the subject and the artists who took the picture.\n\"I say to them, you know these people didn't live their lives in black and white — they lived their lives in colour,\" he said.\n\"All I'm trying to do is let you see them how they were seen by their peers and see the world as they saw the world when they were alive.\"\nFor this project, Nash blended a photo of Cavendish Square in St. John's from 1925 with one from 2014. (Facebook/ThePhotoMender)\nNash uses Photoshop software to restore and colourize the photos, a process which can take several hours from start to finish. He said some projects are easier than others.\n\"The way Photoshop works is you have to break everything down into a separate layer,\" he told CBC.\n\"So I would have to separate out the sky, separate out the trees — and that's not always easy to do because older photographs don't always have that crispness. Some tips of the trees are going to blend into the sky, so you how do you separate that out? It's very difficult to do.\"\nCirca 1944 in Wesleyville #Newfoundland .

In fact, photos he restored have been used in two documentaries about the Regiment, including CBC's Trail of the Caribou .\nNash says customers often have emotional responses to the work he does, but nothing comes close to a photo he colourized for for the family of a 99-year-old man.\nSgt.

The man had never met his father, so when he got to see the bright coloured photo of his father and family, he was extremely touched.\n\"The family brought it up to him at the old folk's home and said 'you would not believe it, he wouldn't let go of it, he just kept looking at the picture with a big smile on his face',\" said Nash.\n\"People tell me that they tend to stare at the picture a lot longer when it's in colour, it really brings it to life and makes it seem more realistic. You notice things in the picture that you don't notice when it's in black and white, because everything kind of blends together.\"\nRobert Peary with Captain Bob Bartlett in Battle Harbour, #Labrador , in 1909, returning from the North Pole #mondaymotivation #newfoundland pic.twitter.com/WEcBzXLYcH\n— @NLHistory Business has been good for The Photo Mender lately, and Nash says the low Canadian dollar means he's been getting a lot of calls from people in the United States who are interested in commissioning works. The New York Publishing Company even has him working on some book covers to be released later this year.\nNash has also launched a Twitter account to share some of his favourites, and is also considering publishing a coffee table book and a calendar as well.\nIn the meantime, Nash will continue working on both projects of passions and commissioned works for his customers. As a history buff, he said both types of work are quite enjoyable.\n\"It's nice knowing the story behind it,\" he said. \"That gives me great satisfaction.\"\nCheck out more of Nash's work below:\nSt. John's Regatta 1890. #newfoundland #nfld pic.twitter.com/f6MxKyXgHx\n— @NLHistory\nMarconi and his engineers and backers at Cabot Tower circa 1901 #newfoundland pic.twitter.com/LxkhOJvPWm\n— @NLHistory\nIn 1937, on a trip to the #Newfoundland seal hunt aboard the S.S.
