I think people were waiting as prices kept growing year over year â€” particularly first time buyers,\" he told the St. John's Morning Show .\nChris Janes is a senior market analyst with the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, based in St. John's. (CBC)\n\"They were waiting to jump in, perhaps waiting for a pullback and now that's happened and I think they've identified this as a good time to buy.\"\nRental markets Janes said the St. John's rental market has also been hit by the economic downturn, with residential vacancy rates up eight per cent from last year, and five per cent for the year prior to that.\nThe average price of a two-bedroom apartment is stable at around $900 per month, according to Janes, however he said that could be deceiving.\nThat's because newly-built higher-end apartment developments, such those in the Pleasantville area, drives the average prices up, despite the fact that older apartments may actually be getting cheaper to rent.\n\"As new inventory coming onto depressed market, it drives up the vacancy rate,\" he said. \"But rent also goes up because those (in Pleasantville) are expensive.\"\nRed tape As the market shifts from where it was a few years ago, property owners will adjust by making changes to houses and apartments to make them more appealing to those with a lower price point.\nChris Janes with the CMHC says red tape from municipal governments is often getting in the way of developers making adjustments to properties to make them more appealing to renters and first time buyers. (Canadian Press)\nHowever, Janes said municipalities like St. John's often get in the way of allowing those changes to happen smoothly, especially when it comes to people applying to the city to modify the properties.\nHe thinks it's counterproductive for municipalities to block people who just want to think outside the box and adapt to the downturn.\n\"Red tape has certainly been on the increase over the years as the market as grown,\" he said.\n\"When people are trying to get regulation changes to allow a development or get roads re-routed ,or whatever it may take to alter the landscape, they're running up against issues.\"\nWith files from the St. John's Morning Show", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:09:38.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
