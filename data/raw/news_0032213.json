And there are more than a few competitors at the event who do that.\nBen Cumberland of the Maritime College of Forest Technology won the rookie world championship last year in Austria. His whole family is involved with the sport.\n“There's just something about sinking a sharp axe into a nice piece of wood, it's just addicting,” said Cumberland.\nOver the years, the woodsmen teams have been some of the most successful campus athletic squads at the Dalhousie Agricultural campus. Some competitors say it's an activity they hope to continue in their lives.\n“I know a lot of competitors in the Maritimes who are still going,” said Cumberland. “Their 60s into their 70s and they're still chopping, so lord willing, I'll do it as long as I can.”\nWith files from CTV Atlantic’s Dan MacIntosh. \nRelated Stories Traditional Canadian lumberjack sport enjoying popularity in Canada Photos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:59:23.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
