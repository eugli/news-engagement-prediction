Citing funding threats for sanctuary jurisdictions by President Donald Trump , Miami-Dade commissioners voted 9-to-3 in favor of Mayor Carlos Gimenez’s order, which declared that Miami-Dade \"has never been a sanctuary community,\" according to a statement. The commissioners stood behind Gimenez despite listening to scores of residents who spent the day at County Hall hoping to persuade them to help protect Miami-Dade’s immigrant identity. Miami-Dade is the only U.S. county where a majority of residents were born abroad, according to the Associated Press. The county also has the largest population of Cuban-Americans in the country, according to the county’s website. Protesters were heard shouting \"shame on you\" after the vote, according a reporter for ABC News affiliate WPLG.

The mayor, who himself is an immigrant, announced last month that the county would comply with Trump’s crackdown on so-called sanctuary communities. Trump threatened in an executive order to cut federal funding from \" sanctuary\" cities that sheltered immigrants who are living in the country illegally.
