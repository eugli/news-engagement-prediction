Justin Diaz \nGoogle and LG’s newest smartwatches are a go and have officially been announced as of earlier this week, and along with them came the announcement of the Android Wear 2.0 launch which is rumored to hit existing smartwatches on February 15th. While that has not been confirmed just yet, what has been confirmed is that the LG Watch Style and the LG Watch Sport both launch with Android Wear 2.0 software running on them, and both watches just went on sale today as one would have it. While the LG Watch Style will be on sale at both Best Buy and the Google Store, the LG Watch Sport is making appearances on the shelves of Verizon and AT&T retail locations, as well as on their websites. But which are you personally going to buy? \nBoth the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport offer up compelling features, and this is mostly because they’re both powered by the same software. There are one or two things that each has which the other does not though, which may or may not sway some consumers to lean one way or the other if they’re thinking about buying one of them. The LG Watch Style for instance, has the ability to officially swap out the watch straps, allowing for a little bit more customization and a personalized feel. While the LG Watch Sport may be able to somehow swap straps at some point, it’s not looking like a possibility as LG has placed the antennas for things like NFC, GPS and other connectivity features inside of the band, which means consumers are probably stuck with what comes on the watch. \nThat leads to what the LG Watch Sport is working with, though, that the LG Watch Style is not. It carries both built-in GPS and NFC, which means it can make Android Pay payments thanks to the new support on the platform. It can also utilize GPS features which are baked into certain apps, like Strava’s beacon feature . So while each watch is sure to be a great device, each has a tiny bit of uniqueness to it that will catch the eyes of certain individuals more than the other. It all comes down to what you want the most. Post navigation", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:43:24.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
