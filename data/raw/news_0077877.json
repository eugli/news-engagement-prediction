It cannot, cannot be last year since the last one. What should be a wonderful celebration of reading has turned into a festival of failure and self-recrimination as yet again you’ve failed to conjure up a Where’s Wally/Oompa-Lompa/Pippi Longstocking costume out of your well-stocked remnants cupboard and vast literary imagination.\nThen comes the mortification as you experience flashbacks of past fails – for me, the lacrosse stick hastily fashioned from the cardboard inner-tube from a roll of wrapping paper and a washing powder net for Enid Blyton’s The Naughtiest Girl . Yes, it was every bit as shonky as that sounds.\nBlyton's The Naughiest Girl - in a rush T here are other World-Book-Day-Costume seven stages of grief too...\nResentment - at the snobbery that surrounds it. There’s no greater signifier of middle-class smug parenting than a reception-aged child dressed in a homemade costume in homage of an award-winning book, or one of those classics that nobody actually reads. Still, you take solace from the fact that you’ll never be as bad as the woman from Manchester who thought that Christian Grey from Fifty Shades was an appropriate outfit for an 11-year-old boy (grey suit, eye mask, cable ties).\nFury - at the realisation that polyester shop-bought costumes don’t cut it. It’s tempting to stick your daughter in her Disney Princess dress and mumble something about how you’ve based it on Charles Perrault’s 17th Century Cinderella (that you read in the original French, mais bien sûr), but no one will believe you, ditto that tatty Jack Sparrow costume from Pirates of the Caribbean won’t fool anyone into thinking that you’ve all curled up with Treasure Island .\nDenial - no child actually cares about it, surely. Then your imagination fills with visions of your grown-up darling on a psychiatrist’s couch, wailing of the humiliation of being the only pupil in the school not in fancy dress.\nHorror - as you wonder whether the Key Stage 1 teaching assistant will be donning her saucy Alice in Wonderland costume again this year, while you can never unsee the eyeful you got of the headmaster in those Roy of the Rovers shorty-shorts.\nFear - how long will this go on? Do teenagers in secondary still dress up as Hermione Granger? (Short answer: no, in general, they don’t. There are some advantages to adolescent self-mortification).\nBut learn from me as I bring you hard-won wisdom from a decade, three children and over 20 costumes.\nThe trick is not to think of a character and construct a costume, but to find any old item of clothing lying round the house and think of the character to match. I guarantee that there is almost no everyday outfit that can’t be shoehorned into an acceptable book costume.\nSeven costume hacks (in 20-ish minutes) 1. PJ imagination Did granny get your son some old-fashioned stripy pyjamas for Christmas? He can be the eponymous Boy in the Striped Pyjamas , or if the Holocaust is too grown-up a theme, then opt for Michael Darling in Peter Pan or Tom in Tom’s Midnight Garden .\nAccessories are your friend - see this Billionaire Boy costume 2. School days P erhaps your child attends the sort of smart school with a delightfully retro uniform, in which case the school days classics are a gift to you. Put a tie round their waist and they can be any Enid Blyton heroine from Malory Towers or the Twins at St Clares , while boys can go for Tom Brown’s Schooldays (a book which I’m convinced no child has ever read, even back in 1857). See to o Just William .\nEvery child loves a school heroine like Matilda 3. Recycle O ld Halloween costumes double-up too, but you might need to chip off the dried chocolate and Haribos. Spider outfits make a great Charlotte from Charlotte’s Web, a pointy black hat for the Worst Witch or, if you squint, a pumpkin can become James’s Giant Peach .\nUpcycle old Halloween costumes, like this take on Charlotte's Web 4. Play to their strengths T hink about your child and what they wear at weekends. If they’re never happier than in football kit, then there are books involving goal-scoring heroes. I love the Jamie Johnson books by Dan Freedman, but I believe (she says snootily) there’s also a series called The David Beckham Academy . If your daughter’s off-duty uniform is a hoodie and a sour expression, she can be any one of Jacqueline Wilson’s hundreds of heroines.\nHat? Check. Victorian dirt? Check. One Oliver Twist, sir 5. Go prop mad A ccessories are your friend. A pair of cords and a tank-top just needs a piece of card with ‘Wonka’s Golden Ticket’ printed across it (template easily Googled) for a take on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . A long, vaguely medieval dress can be any queen in history or, with the addition of a bottle of healing cordial, she’s Lucy Pevensie in the Narnia Chronicles . Take the school-girl outfit as outlined above, find a notebook and pencil and she’s one of the juvenile detectives in the brilliant Murder Most Unladylike books.\nNever underestimate the power of cardboard 6. Dress up... T his was a prize-winner one year at my kids’ school – a boy (unusually confident in his own masculinity) donned a frock and voila, David Walliams’ The Boy in the Dress . In these gender-fluid times, there’s no reason why this costume can’t work for your daughter too – a girl pretending to be a boy who likes girls’ clothes.\n7. Keep it simple Just moved house and can’t find the dressing up box? See that packing case over there - pop your poppet in one of the flattened out cardboard boxes and ta-da Flat Stanley . Genius.\nThey won't want to dress up like this for long... A nd if you’re still feeling depressed? Then just remember, the World Book Day years pass all too quickly.\nIt’s not a thing at secondary for my son and my daughter, in her penultimate year at primary, is now refusing to be dressed up as Matilda Wormwood or Katniss Everdeen to reflect her mother’s you-go-girl feminism.\nAnd of course, I rather miss it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:19:32.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
