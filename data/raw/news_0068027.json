Credit Ronaldo Schemidt/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images MEXICO CITY — In the White House, President Trump was telling American chief executives that the days of being treated unfairly by Mexico — on trade, on immigration, on crime — were over. “You see what’s happening at the border: All of a sudden for the first time, we’re getting gang members out,” Mr. Trump said. “And it’s a military operation.” But in Mexico, his Homeland Security secretary, John F. Kelly, was saying the opposite, trying to tamp down fears of a military operation and assuring the public that American soldiers would not be used to police the border. “I repeat: There will be no use of military in this,” Mr. Kelly said at a news conference on Thursday, appearing with Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state. “At least half of you try to get that right, because it continues to come up in your reporting.” United States relations with Mexico have sunk to their lowest point in decades, with a steady stream of policy announcements and statements from the White House that have enraged the Mexican public and left their leaders scrambling to figure out how to respond. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But it remains unclear which version of Washington will come to bear on Mexico in the coming months —the more aggressive approach of the American president or the more reassuring stance of Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Kelly, whose job will be to oversee many proposals likely to antagonize Mexico the most. “Let me be very, very clear,” Mr. Kelly added, assuring Mexicans that the rules for deporting people from the United States had not fundamentally changed. “There will be no, repeat no, mass deportations.” The American visit to Mexico did little to resolve the differences and contradictions. Four officials — two from Mexico and two from the United States — walked into a large ballroom with grim faces and delivered carefully worded statements without taking questions. It was the kind of cautious staging normally seen after tough negotiations between adversaries, not conversations between friendly neighbors. No one suggested that a breakthrough had been made.
