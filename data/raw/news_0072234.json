(CBC)\nThe trial, which has been ongoing for the last two weeks, has centred on whether the complainant consented to sex after Snelgrove, a 10-year veteran of the RNC, drove her home in a police cruiser and helped her get into her basement apartment in Dec. 2014.\nDuring her instructions to the jury prior to deliberations, Marshall emphasized that Snelgrove can only be found guilty if he used force that was sexual in nature without her consent.\nShe said Snelgrove has admitted there was sex between him and the woman, so the jury will need to decide whether she consented or not, and whether the RNC officer knew she didn't or couldn't consent.\nMarshall, on consent, says that the complainant said she doesn't know if she consented. Can't recall because had been drinking. #cbcnl pic.twitter.com/dG3ZjGaoNV\nâ€” @glenn_payette The complainant, who was 21 at the time of the alleged assault, has testified she was drinking before and after going downtown, and can't remember agreeing to sex.\nSnelgrove testified the woman invited him in and initiated sex.\nMarshall said the Crown must show that the woman didn't consent or that she was so drunk that she couldn't consent.\nStay with CBC NL for updates when the jury makes its decision.\nWith files from Glenn Payette", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/glenn_payette/status/834769909380943872", "https://t.co/dG3ZjGaoNV", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/cbcnl?src=hash"], "published": "2017-02-23T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:10:35.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
