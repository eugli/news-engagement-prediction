(ABC News: Marco Catalano) \nCory Bernardi's likely defection from the Liberal Party is placing the Prime Minister under growing internal pressure to adopt a more conservative agenda. \nThe South Australian Senator is expected to announce to parliament this afternoon that he is quitting the Coalition to set up a rival party â€” Australian Conservatives. \nLNP backbencher George Christensen has warned that the government's position will become 'untenable' unless it embraces more 'traditional' causes. \n'It really sends a signal to the Coalition that we need to double down on efforts that we've tried to make, with things like 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act and other issues, that really speak to our conservative base'. \nHe said immigration and radical Islam were other issues of concern to the conservative base of Coalition support. \n'There's some countries where we put a higher onus of proof, all the requirements you need to show us, before you come here, and I think we need to have a look at those countries where there's a high level of radicalism, a high level of terrorist activity and do similar to what they're doing in the US ... ban certain countries from general immigration'. \nThe MP also said the government needed to stick to its guns on a plebiscite for same-sex marriage. \n'There's people who are chomping at the bit for a different policy, Labor's policy. We're not going to go down that path. If we do go down that path, I see it personally as a breach of the Coalition agreement, because that was part of the agreement, that we continue the policy of the plebiscite', he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:46:56.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
