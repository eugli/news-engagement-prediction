Panthers, New York Giants Larry Fitzgerald and Eli Manning were co-winners of the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, the third time the award has been shared. Larry Fitzgerald and Eli Manning  28  28 p.m. ET \nCardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald and Giants quarterback Eli Manning were the co-winners of the 2016 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award. \nIt's only the third time in the award's 47-year history there have been co-recipients. Congratulations to Eli Manning & @LarryFitzgerald ! 2016 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award winners, presented by @Nationwide ! #WPMOY pic.twitter.com/gNlCik0KLd — NFL (@NFL) February 5, 2017 \nFitzgerald and Manning beat out fellow finalist Greg Olsen, the Panthers' Pro Bowl tight end. \nEach of the 32 NFL teams selected a nominee before those players were whittled down to the three finalists. \nMORE: The best Super Bowl-winning teams ranked, 1-50 \n\"Quite simply this is the most meaningful honor an NFL player can receive and I am flattered beyond words that the selection committee deemed me worthy of it,” Fitzgerald said. “More than anything it is a reflection on my parents whose words and example taught my brother and me the value of service and the importance of giving back. \n“It's a commitment that I know is shared by Eli, Greg, all the other 2016 Man of the Year nominees and countless others throughout the NFL. I accept this honor with immense gratitude and humility but also in full recognition that it is on behalf of all of them as well.\" \nManning, whose brother, Peyton, won the award in 2005, said he just wants to make a difference in people's lives. \n“I think I speak for all of us when I say that anytime you’re mentioned in the same breath with Walter Payton, it’s a tremendous honor,\" Manning said. “None of us do what we do on behalf of charity or in our communities to get recognized. We do it because we truly care. You want to make a difference in people’s lives and in our communities. But to be recognized and know that that people do notice your work is nice.” \nIn addition to their well-publicized feats on the field, both Manning and Fitzgerald have been prolific in their charitable work. The Larry Fitzgerald First Down Fund has provided more than $1 million in grants to promote reading and tech access for K-12 students and to support efforts to prevent and cure breast cancer and support survivors. Fitzgerald has also worked with charities as a volunteer to promote vision care for children, to provide hearing aids for people around the world and to visit countries in Africa to promote economic development. \nManning has been active in children's causes. He has served as the Chair of the New York March for Babies for the past seven years, helping raise more than $25 million. Manning also leads \"Tackle Kids' Cancer,\" in an initiative with Hackensack University Medical Center. Manning has also reached out to Mississippi. Manning and his wife founded the Eli and Abby Manning Children's Clinics in 2007, and raised close to $3 million in funding. They also established the University of Mississippi Medical Center Manning Family Fund. \nThe NFL Man of the Year Award has been given out each year since 1970. It was later renamed in honor of Payton, the legendary Bears running back. \nWalter Payton Man of the Year Winners 2015: Anquan Boldin, San Francisco 49ers 2014: Thomas Davis, Carolina Panthers 2013: Charles Tillman, Chicago Bears 2012: Jason Witten, Dallas Cowboys 2011: Matt Birk, Baltimore Ravens 2010: Madieu Williams, Minnesota Vikings 2009: Brian Waters, Kansas City Chiefs 2008: Kurt Warner, Arizona Cardinals 2007: Jason Taylor, Miami Dolphins 2006: LaDainian Tomlinson, San Diego Chargers and Drew Brees, New Orleans Saints 2005: Peyton Manning, Indianapolis Colts 2004: Warrick Dunn, Atlanta Falcons 2003: Will Shields, Kansas City Chiefs 2002: Troy Vincent, Philadelphia Eagles 2001: Jerome Bettis, Pittsburgh Steelers 2000: Derrick Brooks, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Jim Flanigan, Green Bay Packers 1999: Cris Carter, Minnesota Vikings 1998: Dan Marino, Miami Dolphins 1997: Troy Aikman, Dallas Cowboys 1996: Darrell Green, Washington Redskins 1995: Boomer Esiason, New York Jets 1994: Junior Seau, San Diego Chargers 1993: Derrick Thomas, Kansas City Chiefs 1992: John Elway, Denver Broncos 1991: Anthony Muñoz, Cincinnati Bengals 1990: Mike Singletary, Chicago Bears 1989: Warren Moon, Houston Oilers 1988: Steven Largent, Seattle Seahawks 1987: Dave Duerson, Chicago Bears 1986: Reggie Williams, Cincinnati Bengals 1985: Dwight Stephenson, Miami Dolphins 1984: Marty Lyons, New York Jets 1983: Rolf Benirschke, San Diego Chargers 1982: Joe Theismann, Washington Redskins 1981: Lynn Swann, Pittsburgh Steelers 1980: Harold Carmichael, Philadelphia Eagles 1979: Joe Greene, Pittsburgh Steelers 1978: Roger Staubach, Dallas Cowboys 1977: Walter Payton, Chicago Bears 1976: Franco Harris, Pittsburgh Steelers 1975: Ken Anderson, Cincinnati Bengals 1974: George Blanda, Oakland Raiders 1973: Len Dawson, Kansas City Chiefs 1972: Willie Lanier, Kansas City Chiefs 1971: John Hadl, San Diego Chargers 1970: Johnny Unitas, Baltimore Colts Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:51:01.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
