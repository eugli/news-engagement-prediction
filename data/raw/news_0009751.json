Win he did and since taking charge on January 20, he has come through on some of his assurances to his supporters. ET Magazine turns the spotlight on those decisions, most of which concern immigration. \n\n\nWall on US Border with Mexico \n\nAfter assuming office, Trump acted on one of his election planks and announced that the US would build a wall covering more than half of its 3,060 km border with Mexico (there is fencing for over 1,000 km). He said it would cost $10-12 billion, but one estimate puts the expense at more than twice that number. Trump wants Mexico to pay for the wall but the Latin American country has refused; Trump might impose a tax on Mexican imports \n\nNod to Dakota Access and Keystone XL Pipelines \n\nRestrictions on H-1B Visas Cut in Federal Grants to 'Sanctuary' Cities Climate change activists have been painting bleak scenarios for the environment under Trump and, vindicating them, he has cleared two oil pipelines put on hold by the Obama administration , over concerns about ecological damages and continued reliance on conventional energy sources. Moreover, Trump has mandated the use of only American steel in the construction of the 1,825 km Dakota Access pipeline, running across the US, and the 1,900 km Canada-US Keystone XL pipeline \n\nBan on Refugees and Migrants from Muslim Countries \n\nIn a controversial move, Trump has banned the entry of nationals of seven Muslimmajority countries — Syria, Yemen, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Somalia — for 90 days from January 27; put on hold the admission of Syrian refugees indefinitely and other refugees for four months; and halved the annual quota of refugees the US will take in. A court has stayed deportations of valid visa holders from the seven countries and the government has clarified US green card holders from these countries are exempted from the ban \n\n\nWithdrawal from Trans-Pacific Partnership \n\nKeeping a key election promise signalling protectionism, Trump signed an order pulling the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a key trade deal with 11 other countries, including Mexico, Singapore, Australia and Japan, the only country to have ratified the deal signed a year ago. Trump is also likely to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, which he says will protect American workers \n\nRestrictions on H-1B Visas \n\nCut in Federal Grants to 'Sanctuary' Cities Climate change activists have been painting bleak scenarios for the environment under Trump and, vindicating them, he has cleared two oil pipelines put on hold by the Obama administration, over concerns about ecological damages and continued reliance on conventional energy sources. Moreover, Trump has mandated the use of only American steel in the construction of the 1,825 km Dakota Access pipeline, running across the US, and the 1,900 km Canada-US Keystone XL pipeline \"I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labour programme,\" said Trump during his presidential campaign, giving a scare to Indian IT companies, which get the majority of 85,000 H-1B visas (including 20,000 for master's degree holders) — for high-skilled foreign workers — every year. Now reports suggest Trump will issue an executive order making it harder for companies to get H-1B visas, three-fourths of which go to Indians, and doing away with work permits for spouses, sending shares of Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro and Tech Mahindra tumbling. Moreover, a bill introduced by a Democrat in US Congress has sought the doubling of the minimum annual wage for an H-1B applicant from $60,000 to $1,30,000 \n\n\nCut in Federal Grants to 'Sanctuary' Cities \n\nIn yet another salvo aimed at immigrants, the government has said it would block federal grants to over 400 \"sanctuary\" cities and counties, including Washington, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, which protect undocumented migrants from deportation \n\nSource: The Guardian, BBC, Vox.com and other media websites  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T07:37:50.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
