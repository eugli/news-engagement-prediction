(Photo: Larry Olmsted, for USA TODAY) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe scene: 100 years and three generations later, American Coney Island claims to be the oldest family-owned business in Michigan. By any measure, it is one of the nation’s most iconic restaurants, a fixture in downtown Detroit since the city was riding high on the auto business, through its decline, and now during its upswing. \nAmerican Coney sits next door to its arch rival, Lafayette Coney Island, making this downtown stretch of Lafayette Boulevard the Motor City’s epicenter of all things hot dog. While each has its devoted fans, I’ve been to both, and for visitors seeking to experience Michigan’s “Coney culture,” I heartily recommend American for food, service and ambiance (though grittier Lafayette has better fries). \nThe restaurant occupies the triangular corner location where it began as a sidewalk street cart, which was operated by the current sibling owners’ grandfather before it moved into the wedge-shaped interior. American Coney has grown considerably since, and in 1992 took over the men’s clothing store next door (between it and Lafayette), adding a large main dining room. The entire place is patriotically tacky, all bedecked in red, white and blue, with a spacious but fast food meets diner formica feel inside, an open kitchen of flattops and fryers behind the counters, and table service. \nAmerican Coney Island has been seen in more than a dozen movies, including the recent remake of Red Dawn , and parts are frequently rented out for private parties, from graduation and wedding rehearsal dinners to the annual black tie hot dog gala that has become an endearing tradition of the Detroit Auto Show. The Lions, Tigers and Red Wings (pro football, baseball and hockey teams respectively), all play within walking distance, and the establishment is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. “If we closed on Christmas we’d have a lot of upset customers,” says Grace Keros, the granddaughter of the founder. “Their families fly in from all around the country for the holidays and they come here — often straight from the airport.” \nLike many Detroiters, the owner of the D Las Vegas casino hotel, dually named for Detroit and Downtown Vegas, was a regular customer, and he opened the first outpost of American Coney Island on pedestrian Fremont Street in Sin City, also serving 24/7. “Our Vegas location has been open for four years,\" says Keros. \"They are killing it, best hot dog in the city. We ship the Coneys and buns right from here.” The Vegas space is attached to the front of the D, but with its own entrance, giving it a standalone feel. It is much smaller, more of a stand, and lacks the festive air of the original, making it a fine place to quench your desire for the food, but you don’t get the full experience. \nCelebrity chef Michael Symon, a Midwesterner, rated American the best Coney in the country; Man vs. Food star Adam Richman put it on his show; and the eatery attracts a who’s who of locals — Detroit music legend Kid Rock even has his locally made Badass beer on the menu. Walls are adorned with celebrity pictures, even one of renowned competitive hot dog eating champ Takeru Kobayashi, who judged the annual Labor Day contest here. There is one other interesting piece of décor: a framed certificate from Michigan’s governor recognizing May 23, 2012 as American Coney Island’s 95th anniversary. \nReason to visit: Coney Island dogs \nThe food: The story goes that Greek immigrants entering through New York’s Ellis Island often made their way through Brooklyn’s Coney Island, birthplace of Nathan’s Famous and one of the key spots in hot dog history. Some say these immigrants, unfamiliar with the name “hot dog,” began calling the franks Coney Islands, or simply Coneys. In any case, the term quickly took on a more specific meaning. “In the rest of the country ‘Coney Island’ refers to an amusement park and boardwalk, but here it is a type of food,” says Keros. Operated mainly by those of Greek descent, the Coney Island-style restaurant was born in Michigan, and a Coney refers to a particular type of natural casing hot dog adorned with chili, onions and mustard. Just as a Chicago-style dog is made so by a very particular type of frankfurter, bun and array of toppings, so too is the Coney. Keros’ grandfather saw hot dog carts in Brooklyn, but came to Detroit because he wrongly heard there were auto jobs. Unemployed, he started a cart himself on this corner. \nThe typical order here for one person is two Coneys all the way, meaning with chili, sweet onion and tangy mustard, plus chili cheese fries. Keros firmly believes that a Coney needs all three toppings, which are included, so here they cost $2.50 — the same as for a plain dog. In a demonstration before his guest judging, Kobayashi scarfed down five Coneys all the way — in 30 seconds. Like its famous Cincinnati counterpart, also of Greek origin, the chili sauce is not spicy Tex Mex style, but more flavored with spices, mild but tasty, meaty, and better than almost every chili dog sauce I’ve tried around the country, including Cincinnati’s. Served on a steamed bun, it’s a very good sandwich, but the fries are quite ordinary, which is probably why everyone smothers them in toppings. An even better idea is to skip them altogether and try a bag of Better Made brand potato chips, the local favorite. Tour Detroit's historic Eastern Market \nSauerkraut, a very popular hot dog topping in most of the country, is not available, but the most important rule here is to skip America’s favorite condiment. “You’re not going to put ketchup on that, are you?” an amazed and slightly disgusted Keros asks my dining partner when he reaches for the bottle, adding, “It’s against the law. It’s for the fries.” She isn’t kidding; the restaurant didn’t even have ketchup until it started serving fries in the '80s, and while staff is very friendly and there are lots of choices and options, as a matter of principle they will not apply ketchup to a dog, and if you require this, you have to do it yourself — ideally when the owner is not watching. \nThe franks at American are custom made by Dearborn Sausage from a proprietary recipe, a blend of pork and beef with a natural casing that snaps when you bite it, a hallmark that has enabled the restaurant to get into the mail order business in a big way, shipping its boxed red, white and blue Coney Kits all over the country. Each box contains a dozen sausages on dry ice, buns, chili sauce and even one of the paper hats the restaurant cooks wear. \nThe other traditional offering at most Coney restaurants, including American, is the Loose Burger, a pile of crumbled cooked burger meat packed into a hot dog roll and topped “all the way” just like the Coney. It’s an interesting choice if you don’t like dogs, but minus the formed patty, it’s too mushy to be a burger, and lacks the appealing snap that makes the Coney dog so good. There are a handful of more traditional Greek specialties offered, including gyro sandwiches and platters, Greek salad with or without chicken or gyro meat, and spinach pie, along with baklava for dessert. But the reason to visit, at any time of day or night, is for the unique and tasty Coney Island dog, with at least chili and a side of atmospheric culinary history. And maybe one of Kid Rock’s brews. \nWhat regulars say: “I’m a fourth-generation customer,\" says Michael Patrick Shiels, host of radio’s statewide Michigan Big Show, and the state’s Radio Personality of the Year winner several times over. \"My dad would take us for haircuts downtown and this would be our reward after. Now I come in my tux every year during the auto show; it’s great, and it’s part of Detroit.” \nPilgrimage-worthy?: No, but a must if in Detroit — it is the Motor City’s iconic eatery. And yes for hot dog junkies. \nRating: Yum! (Scale: Blah, OK, Mmmm, Yum!, OMG!) \nPrice: $ ($ cheap, $$ moderate, $$$ expensive) \nDetails: 114 West Lafayette Blvd., Detroit, MI; 313-961-7758; the D Hotel, Las Vegas, NV; 702-338-2120; coneykit.com \nLarry Olmsted has been writing about food and travel for more than 15 years.

Some of the venues reviewed by this column provided complimentary services.   One of the oldest farmers markets in the country, Eastern Market is a popular destination for many Detroiters and visitors. Aside from the market itself, open only on Saturdays, many of the surrounding shops and restaurants are open all week. Devorah Lev-Tov Saturday is market day at the Detroit institution, Eastern Market. People come from all over the state to buy produce, meat and other fresh items each weekend. Eastern Market Filled with wholesalers selling produce, Eastern Market is the place to be on Saturdays. Detroit Wholesale Produce, open to the public, offers items like tomatoes, peppers, cabbage and these giant watermelons in summer. Devorah Lev-Tov Fullscreen American Coney Island originally opened in 1917, with Lafayette opening up next door soon after. So-called Coney Islands are found throughout the city, providing quick, cheap eats like hot dogs and chili fries. It’s unclear where the name stems from, but many think immigrants arriving in New York City who went through Coney Island started the trend. While Lafayette’s décor is more old school greasy spoon, American offers a more fast food chain-esque interior. Devorah Lev-Tov A Detroit classic, a Coney Island hot dog with the works means a snappy dog covered in chili, mustard and diced onion, inside a bun. Devorah Lev-Tov A server delivers Coney dogs with and without onions to hungry diners seated at the bar. Devorah Lev-Tov Astoria Pastry in Greektown has been baking Greek and other desserts for decades. Devorah Lev-Tov Their baklava, like these caramel ones, are some of the best in the city. Devorah Lev-Tov Detroit has several craft breweries but Batch Brewing Company in Corktown is a small-producer favorite. And it has a great space for enjoying its delicious beers and snacks. Customers enjoy the board game selection almost as much as the beers. Devorah Lev-Tov While the offerings change frequently, there’s always a large variety of beers on tap at Batch, offered in two sizes. The small ones are perfect for creating your own tasting flight. Devorah Lev-Tov The original and best according to many, Buddy’s Pizza invented Detroit-style square pizza in 1946. What is Detroit-style pizza? Square with a thick, oily crust and sauce on top of cheese. Trust us, it’s delicious. Jerry Zolynsky, courtesy of Buddy’s Pizza The original location of Buddy’s is still going strong on Conant Street, and there are now 10 other locations throughout the metro Detroit area to get classic Detroit-style square pizza. Buddy’s Pizza Detroit City Distillery in Eastern Market makes small-batch whiskey, vodka and gin using Michigan grains and local ingredients. You can taste (and buy) it at the factory, straight or in one of their delicious housemade cocktails. Devorah Lev-Tov Fullscreen Why just have a taste when you can have a whole cocktail featuring Detroit City Distillery’s small-batch spirits? Functioning as a popular bar, the distillery’s bartenders will mix up creations like Another Bender, featuring the rye whiskey, dried cherry, cynar, bitters and lime, or Breaking Even, which highlights the Gilded Age Vodka mixed with grapefruit, apple shrub and lemon. Kenny Karpov Elias Donuts, open for more than 30 years, serves coffee and doughnuts to the Rosedale community, and anyone else who wants paczki — the Polish jelly-filled treat usually eaten on Paczki Day (aka Fat Tuesday) — year-round, 24 hours a day. Devorah Lev-Tov Aside from Polish paczki, Elias Donuts has lots of other doughnuts to choose from including this one inspired by the Girl Scout cookie Samoa, made with chocolate, caramel and coconut. Devorah Lev-Tov Fullscreen Pop — not soda — is very important to Motowners. So much so that several pop brands were created in Detroit and can only be found in the region. Vernors ginger ale, created by pharmacist James Vernor in 1866, is one of them and it’s celebrating its 150th anniversary this year, making it the oldest surviving ginger ale brand in the USA. Devorah Lev-Tov Fullscreen Germack, in Eastern Market, is a coffee and nut roaster, with two shops side by side: one for coffee, spices and other treats, and the other just for nuts. On the coffee side they sell both raw and roasted coffee beans by the pound, dozens of spices, local small-batch items like jams and hot sauces, baked goods from several Detroit favorites like Avalon Breads and Sisters Pie, and freshly brewed coffee drinks. Devorah Lev-Tov Fullscreen Famous for their pistachios, Germack carries several varieties. One of the founding brothers, Frank Germack, Sr., invented red pistachios when he began dying the nuts bright red to cover up imperfections and stains on the husk. Germack now sells natural and red-dyed pistachios along with other nuts like cashews and Brazil nuts, all of which are roasted on site. Devorah Lev-Tov Ghettoblaster beer, brewed at Motor City Brewing, has become one of the most popular beers in Detroit. The brewery started selling it in cans in 2015. Devorah Lev-Tov Greektown is a downtown neighborhood that has shrunk over the years but is still home to a few classic Greek eateries, including the Golden Fleece, which offers up gyros, sagnaki, moussaka and other specialties. Devorah Lev-Tov There’s always lamb roasting and ready to be sliced and put in the popular gyros at late-night favorite the Golden Fleece in Greektown. Devorah Lev-Tov Fullscreen Green Dot Stables has a theme and you can probably guess what it is. But while it could be too campy or cheesy, here it’s done just right. It’s a prime spot for grabbing a drink and some sliders and is a popular late-night option. Devorah Lev-Tov Inside Green Dot Stables, the horse racing theme is in full effect, with jockey helmets on display and races being shown on TV. Devorah Lev-Tov Fullscreen Known for its mini burgers, or sliders, Green Dot Stables also has sliders of other varieties, basically putting a whole bunch of combinations onto a mini bun for a nominal price (think $2-3). A sweet favorite is the fluffernutter (peanut butter and marshmallow fluff), which is grilled to perfection. Devorah Lev-Tov Ever heard of compressed watermelon? Newcomer Mabel Gray manages to make watermelon even sweeter by well, compressing it, changing the texture, concentrating the flavor, and serving it in a divine salad. Devorah Lev-Tov Mabel Gray opened in the Hazel Park neighborhood in 2016 and was declared the No. 2 best new restaurant in Detroit by the Detroit Free Press and named a James Beard semifinalist for Best New Restaurant. Devorah Lev-Tov The sleek but eclectic space provides a cozy backdrop for the creative new American dishes coming out of chef James Rigato’s kitchen where the menu changes daily. Devorah Lev-Tov Fullscreen Vegetables are treated with loving care by chef Rigato, a 'Top Chef' Season 12 contestant and acclaimed chef of Root restaurant in White Lake, Mich. before opening Mabel Gray, where these perfectly cooked carrots are served with crème fraiche, pistachios and dill. Devorah Lev-Tov Started in Detroit and Brooklyn by two brothers, this pickle company has become popular across the country. Try it from the source at Eastern Market on Saturdays and definitely give the bloody mary mixer a go. Devorah Lev-Tov Fullscreen Eastern Market’s Mootown Creamery is an old-fashioned ice cream shop with dozens of flavors at any given time. The Superman flavor — named for its red, yellow and blue colors — is a true Motor City experience that you’ll find at most ice cream shops in the D. The three swirled flavors vary by shop, but it’s definitely not just vanilla with food coloring. At Mootown, it’s banana, cherry and “blue moon,” a Midwest flavor tasting vaguely of marshmallow and Fruity Pebbles. Devorah Lev-Tov Motor City Brewing Works is a Midtown favorite, providing a large space to sample the brewery’s various concoctions. Devorah Lev-Tov Fullscreen Detroiters have a thing for corned beef and one of the best makers of it, Sy Ginsberg and United Deli, is based in Detroit. Mudgie’s Deli, one of the best deli restaurants in the city, has Sy Ginsberg corned beef, which they roast in house, on several of its sandwiches including the Barrett, which tops it with cole slaw, Swiss cheese, and thousand island dressing. The list of sandwich options at Mudgie’s is endless but you really can’t go wrong. Devorah Lev-Tov Fullscreen Mudgie’s Deli, which opened in the old Eph McNally’s Delicatessen space by former employee Greg Mudge in 2008, is divided into several rooms, plus a large outdoor patio. The wood-inlay bar in the center room is always a friendly spot. Devorah Lev-Tov An elaborate Neptune mural presides over Greek eatery New Parthenon in Greektown. The saganaki — flaming cheese — is a must-order and comes with a great big “Opa!” Devorah Lev-Tov The enclave of Hamtramck has a large Polish population and is famous for its Polish food. The Polish Village Café, on a quiet side street off the main drag, is known for having the best pierogis in town. Devorah Lev-Tov Fullscreen When star Midwest chef Michael Symon opened Roast inside The Westin Book Cadillac hotel in downtown Detroit back in 2008, it helped kickstart the city’s fine dining revolution. Roast specializes in all things meat and is known for its decadent bone marrow dish. Michael Symon Restaurants Fullscreen Part of the newer wave of restaurants in the city, Rose’s Fine Food opened in 2014 in a space that has been a diner on and off for years. But this isn’t typical greasy spoon fare — cousins Lucy Carnaghi and Molly Mitchell serve dishes like the Upstream Sandwich, an open-faced sandwich with locally raised, pan-seared trout, aioli, cornichons, and the Dude Abides, an heirloom rice bowl with seasonal vegetables. Devorah Lev-Tov Any diner worth its salt has to have pancakes. But Rose’s Fine Food takes them to a new level by putting crumbled bacon inside. Yes, they’re incredible. Devorah Lev-Tov Fullscreen Rose’s Fine Food, paying respect to the classic diner, serves a classic egg cream. But instead of offering chocolate milk it has blackstrap molasses milk on the menu, a sweet, malty milk drink that’s actually not so bad for you. Devorah Lev-Tov Fullscreen Rose’s Fine Food has helped revitalize this east side area and offers neighborhood residents a 10% discount. It also makes a point of paying its workers a living wage, making tips not necessary. Open only for breakfast and lunch, be prepared to wait for a table.
