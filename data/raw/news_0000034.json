Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA woman who'd threatened to harm herself if she split from her boyfriend was found hanged after she texted him: \"I've done it, thanks\". \nKeep-fit centre manager Lyndsey Higgins, 30, was found dead by businessman Martin Westwell after he failed to get a reply to his \"done what?\" message back. \nAn inquest heard today she had met the former fireman on a dating website - and used bouts of self-harm to ''control'' their volatile relationship. \nPrivately-educated mum-of-one Ms Higgins would cut her arms and had warned her boyfriend she would cause further harm to herself if they split up, it was said. \nAnd they had rowed on the night in question. \nIndeed, on December 18 2015 - after the couple fell out in a petty argument over what Me Westwell described as ''silliness'' - Miss Higgins texted him saying: ''I’ve done it, thanks.'' \nWhen the dad-of-one texted back and failed to get any response, he went round to her apartment in Barnoldswick, Lancashire, to find her hanging from a banister rail. Lyndsey Higgins had threatened to hurt herself if they split up, the inquest was told (Photo: Cavendish) \nThe hearing in Burnley was told Miss Higgins, who was originally from Liverpool, had hoped to study midwifery and had won a place at Chester University. \nShe met Mr Westwell, 44, via a dating website in January 2014 after splitting up with the father of her young son following a 12 year relationship. \nMiss Higgins initially moved in with Mr Westwell and managed his gym Westys whilst he ran a motor repairs company - but she ended up getting a flat nearby where she would stay following arguments. \nIn a statement, Mr Westwell - who claimed he could not attend the inquest for fear he would ''suffer panic attacks'' - said: ''She would manage my gym on a day to day basis and she was very good at it. Lyndsey and Martin had a tempestuous relationship (Photo: Cavendish) \n''But Lyndsey had confided in me that she had previously self harmed, and she found it to be a release to her. \n''She had cut herself on her arms before, and she told me that she did love me, but sometimes she felt like she wanted to do it. \n\"That made her feel bad about herself so she cut herself again. \n\"I felt that she used her self harm to control me and the relationship, saying that if we did split up she would cause harm to herself. \n\"Whenever she spoke to me and said to keep talking because she wanted to hear my voice I knew she had done something.'' \nHe added: “We did begin to argue and the relationship was difficult, arguing about things like the TV was too loud. \n\"On the night before she died we decided to go out to the cinema and she had dropped off her son with her parents. \n''I drove and we struggled to find somewhere to park except for a disabled space, and Lyndsey got annoyed about that. \n“I said to her we won’t have any of this silliness tonight and she got upset saying I was calling her silly. \n\"I said I wasn’t, but I didn’t want to eat anymore so we went back to my house. \n“I dropped her off to her flat, and I went to my gym for about an hour, and I drove past her flat on my way back and her car wasn’t there so I thought she had gone to visit her parents in Liverpool. Lyndsey and Martin had gone to the cinema but had an argument (Photo: Cavendish) \n“At around 9.30pm I got a message saying that she didn’t think we were a good match anymore, I ignored it because she had sent me this many times before. \n\"Later on I got a message apologising and I sent one back also apologising. \n“I then got a text from her at about 10.10pm asking me to go and get her in the morning and that the door would be open.” \nMr Westwell then attended at Lyndsey’s flat to find her in her underwear cuddling a picture of her son - having taken sleeping tablets. \nHe went to the hospital with her and stayed with her until she came round, when she started shouting that she wanted to return home. \nHis statement said: “She got her phone out and tried to call a taxi, and when the doctors asked how she would get home she pointed at me. \n\"I asked her in front of the doctors on purpose if when she got home would she try to kill herself again? Lyndsey's mum didn't think the relationship was working - and had questions (Photo: Cavendish) \n“She said that she would, but she had run out of sleeping pills so could the doctors give her any more. \n\"She was allowed to discharge herself, and I had no choice but to take her home. \n“In the car on the way back she became aggressive and threatening to myself and my daughter, so I stopped the car and she got out laughing at me and slammed the door. \n\"She tried to call me so I blocked her number on WhatsApp. \n\"I got a text from her saying: ''I’ve done it, thanks.'' I replied with 'done what?' but she didn’t text me after that so I called 999.\" \nMr Westwell went round to Lyndsey's flat again, expecting police and paramedics to already be there, but found her dead. \nIn a second statement he added: “Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Lyndsey was beautiful and I greatly regret not being able to get her the help she needed. \n“She felt like she was a burden to everybody but that just wasn’t true. My heart rate speeds up and I struggle to breathe following Lyndsey's death. ” \nEarlier Miss Higgins' mother Pam, 64, said: “Lyndsey was a loving mother and a lively girl. She was the life and soul of the party. \n\"She came across very confident and was a very determined young lady. \n“She had acne when she was a younger girl and was very conscious about it. \n\"She had been depressed but she had turned her life around and had decided that she wanted to study midwifery, and came out with a distinction in everything.

She was doing very very well. \n\"She met Martin and she moved in with him but in August 2015 she had been away with Martin, and the relationship had started to show its cracks and we knew something wasn’t quite right. \n“They went to Florida together and Martin abandoned her - leaving her with no money or anything in a separate hotel. When they came back they made up. \n\"When she visiting us, she was in her room, and Martin was on the phone to her, but he got hold of us and told us that she had taken a lot of slimming tablets. \n\"We took her to the hospital and I didn’t let her out of my sight for the rest of the time she was with us.''

It went from one extreme to the other, we tried to get her to come back, and say look this isn’t working out how you wanted. \n\"She had a place to go, her bedroom was ready and waiting and we had a nursery place for her son sorted. \n\"Lyndsey had everything to live for. My main concern is why the hospital didn’t try to contact us at all. \n“She had written the contact details down so why didn’t they contact us?'' \nThe inquest continues.
