Antonio Marquis Willis (Bell County Sheriff's Department) \nAntonio Marquis Willis, 25, turned himself in last week in connection with the Dec. 22 slaying of Donte Samuels, the Temple Daily Telegram reported . \nPolice say Samuels showed up three times at a Killeen home. The third time, an arrest-warrant affidavit says, Willis opened the door, told him to leave and then shot him. \nBell County Justice of the Peace Claudia Brown set Willis' bail at $4 billion for a charge of first-degree murder, a number confirmed by Killeen police. \nThe jail's booking software doesn't recognize amounts that high, so his bail shows up in the system as $1,000,000,999.00. \nBrown, a Democrat, was elected justice of the peace in November and is undergoing 80 hours of training for the post. She has previously been a Killeen city council member, a principal and a social worker. \nShe told the Killeen Daily Herald in December that she hoped to bring reform to the criminal-justice system. \n\"People are going into prison like it's adult day care, and it's mostly because they can't afford to get out with the unemployment how it is,\" Brown said. \nWillis' lawyer, Billy Ray Hall Jr., said he was confident about securing a bail reduction in court, calling his client's bail \"the highest bond I've ever had set.\" \nAnother Bell County lawyer, Michael White, said bail is set to protect the public and make sure a defendant shows up to court — it isn't a type of punishment, he said. \n\"This justice of the peace is abusing the bail process in an attempt to make a name for herself, as opposed to setting a reasonable and affordable bond as required by law,\" White said. \"It makes a mockery of the process and a fool of her.\" \nBrown did not return calls seeking comment on the bail amount. \nWillis' bail may be the highest ever set in the United States. In 2004, bail for multimillionaire Robert Durst was set at $3 billion on evidence-tampering and bail-jumping charges, with the judge noting that he was a flight risk, CNN reported . That bail was later lowered, and Durst became infamous for his role in the HBO documentary series The Jinx . \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
