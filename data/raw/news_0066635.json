But if a white person said those words to me, what would happen?” \nThe forum, named after Benjamin Watson’s 2016 book “Under Our Skin: Getting Real about Race,” included the Ravens tight end as well as Hall of Fame football coach Tony Dungy, former Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back Warrick Dunn, CBS sportscaster James Brown and University of South Florida head football coach Charlie Strong, The Christian Post reported. \nMr. Dungy said the path to racial healing starts inside the home. \n“I totally agree with you,” he told Mrs. Steele. “We can’t expect everybody else play by certain rules and we don’t. We can’t expect to treat people wrongly and not expect people to treat us wrongly. I think it’s got to start with us in our families and spread out.” \nMr. Watson said people need to do a better job of understanding the different sides of the racial debate. \n“We live in a culture where you are either there or you’re there but you can’t acknowledge the truth of either one,” he said, The Christian Post reported. “You can’t say that, ‘Yes, folks. We need our daddies at home. We need you to do your job.’ We can’t also then say, ‘It’s also messed up that white families have a networth that is 14 times what black families [have].’ Can we say both? Can both be true? Yes.” \n“I mentioned in my [Facebook] post that I was embarrassed by the violent protesting and the looting and people burning people’s cars because of what happened [in Ferguson, Missouri]. Can I condemn that and can I also say, ‘You know what? I don’t understand why it takes 17 bullets in Chicago to kill a black man on the street.’ Can I say that? They can both be true,” Mr. Watson continued. “As black people and as white people, we need to look at truth for what it is. It’s not tinted or tainted by a certain perspective. It is what it is.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:08:58.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
