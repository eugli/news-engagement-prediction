For our team, we’ve gone to London (twice), and I’ve loved those experiences. They’ve been great bonding trips for our team, and to have the chance to play in Mexico will be just a great experience.” \nThe Raiders beat the Texans in November in front of a sold-out Azteca Stadium crowd of 76,743, and a game against the (defending champion?) Patriots should sell out, too. \nThe Patriots played an exhibition game in Mexico City in 1998, beating Dallas 21-3. \n“There’s a lot of excitement down there, and they love football,” Brady said. “We want to go down there and put on a great show.” \nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell also addressed the Raiders’ potential move to Las Vegas on Wednesday, reiterating that there’s much more work for the league to do before it can make a decision. Raiders owner Mark Davis also has more work to do after casino mogul Sheldon Adelson pulled out of the Vegas stadium deal and financial giant Goldman Sachs reportedly followed suit . \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:18:08.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
