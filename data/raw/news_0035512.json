All six players who came off the bench scored, with the unit scoring 45 points overall. Kelly Olynyk and Terry Rozier led the way with 17 and 11 points, respectively. \nAMIR JOHNSON COMES TO LIFE Johnson has struggled a bit this season, but he played one of his better games Thursday. He hit his first five shots and finished the first half with 10 points. Itâ€™s just the third time in the last 10 games that Johnson has reached double-digits in scoring. \nISAIAH PASSES A LEGEND Thomas scored 29 points against the Bulls for his 41st consecutive game scoring 20-plus points. He passed Celtics legend John Havlicek for the most consecutive games with 20 or more points in team history as a result. These are the two points that pushed IT to 41 consecutive 20+ point games ðŸ”¥ pic.twitter.com/unjBUHlyZk \nâ€” Boston Celtics (@celtics) February 17, 2017 \nThomas also dished out seven assists. \nTHIRD-QUARTER SETBACK The Celtics went into the half with a 58-52 lead, but it was all gone by the end of the third quarter. The Bulls outscored the Celtics 29-20 in the third frame to take an 81-78 edge entering the fourth quarter. Butlerâ€™s offense was the key component to Chicagoâ€™s second half push. He finished the game with 29 points, including a perfect 9-for-9 from the free-throw line. \nHIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT It seems like Smart makes an amazing defensive play like this one each game. Marcus Smart comes up with a HUGE steal and the @celtics have the 103-102 lead & the ball with 28.3 seconds left in the 4Q! pic.twitter.com/Zxlu8MWShF \nâ€” NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 17, 2017 \nUP NEXT NBA All-Star Weekend in New Orleans is here.
