Chatting to news.com.au to mark Chemist Warehouse stocking on her Raw Essentials tea range nationally, Roach spills the tea on how some of the most explosive fights ever seen on reality TV really happen. Janet Roach reveals a few reality TV secrets. Source: Foxtel \nSo Janet, the massive fight scenes on Housewives : real or faked? \nWhen we have these arguments out at dinner, the truth is we’ve probably been there for maybe four or five hours. We’re having a fun, lovely time and they just let us go. After four or five hours of drinking, someone is going to say something that someone doesn’t agree with. Viewers only see that part, but we’ve been there for hours before that having a great time. \nSo you all usually start out in a good mood? \nEveryone starts out fine, but the drinks have an effect. Say, for instance, Lydia says Jackie’s psychic powers are running amok — usually Jackie would just say ‘What would you know?’, but after four or five glasses of wine she takes exception. We never even notice the cameras — a lot of it is zoomed in — they just set us down and let us go. And we don’t pretend — we’re all terrible actors. Janet admits some of her one-on-one catch-ups with the girls can feel like an ambush — which explains this face. Source: Foxtel \nIt sounds like filming a nature documentary! The producers biding their time, waiting for the sparks to fly. \nAbsolutely. There’s times when we’ve had dinners and we haven’t all fought. One time we were all out and Pettifleur was announcing she was an expert on diamonds, an expert at property developing ... then she told Gina she was an expert at the law … Why would you say that, Pettifleur? She can’t even string a sentence together. I do love her. \nAnyway, Gina and I were laughing about it and we had to stop filming because we could not look at Pettifleur; we had to put our heads under the table. We had to abandon the shoot, and they were furious with us. We’re supposed to be arguing but we’re crying with laughter. The Real Housewives Of Melbourne during a rare moment of calm.

What’s happened there? Am I in trouble, is Gamble going to tell me something?’ \nSo you have to go in to that meet-up blind? \nAbsolutely, and it’s terrifying. You know you’re going to be on camera but you don’t know if you’re going to be attacked. Or say you think you’re going for coffee with Gamble, then halfway through the conversation Lydia walks in. You’ve just been calling her a bitch, then she walks in and says ‘Hey, have you been talking about me?’ Janet (at left) with a couple of her fellow Housewives ‘nutters’, Suzie and Gamble. Picture: Julie Kiriacoudis Source: News Corp Australia \nThat sounds so stressful. What keeps you doing the show? \nIt’s scary but it’s so much fun because they are crazy. I love the Housewives. They don’t pay us very much, but you wouldn’t do it for the money. When you go out with seven nutters, it’s really exciting — you don’t know what’s going to happen. \nThe Real Housewives of Sydney starts this Sunday. Do you know much about those ladies? \nI’ve met a couple of the girls and they are lovely. I know the Sydney show is quite different, but I’d love to do State of Origin — we’ve had three years more experience so we’ll smash them! The producers tell me it’s a very different dynamic, because the Sydney girls don’t drink as much as the Melbourne girls. Janet with her Raw Essentials tea range. . Picture: Stephen Harman Source: News Corp Australia \nThe typical ‘Real Housewife’ image is all Botox and champagne — but you’ve got your tea range, Raw Essentials. \nWell I come from a rural background so I know there are lots of micronutrients in plants, and I don’t believe you can absorb them all if they’re isolated. I think they all need to be together. That’s the belief behind the tea: the less tampered with, the better. \nAnd it’s really been a joint operation with your son Jake. How has that come about? \nJake was in a fire [in 2011, suffering burns to 69% of his body] which was just the worst day of my life. It took about three years, many operations, for him to get better. By that stage he was physically together, but not mentally good. I did research and it turns out a lot of people with severe burns can have such difficulty getting back into society — you’re stared at and you’re not used to it. Creating their own tea range has given mother and son a shared passion. Picture: Stephen Harman Source: News Corp Australia \nSo he was well physically, but he was just lying on the couch every day and didn’t want to do anything. I decided that he needed a detox, after having taken so many drugs for so many years in hospital. I made him teas and he did find it worked; it started to make him feel better. \nHe started to get inspired, and said he wanted to start a charity. I knew it was a fulltime job, so I was nervous. He said ‘Hey mum, why don’t you sell the tea, and proceeds from the tea go to charity.’ And here we are! \nHow is Jake now? \nHonestly, we’re having a great time. I never would’ve imagined he’d be where he is now after the fire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:13:53.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
