Even stars who reside in the City of Angels full-time often make use of the luxurious accommodations on offer for pre-show preparations and seamless delivery to the red carpet. Here, a guide to some of Hollywood’s favorite haunts for living it up — and recuperating in style. Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP \nThe Beverly Hilton \nThe Beverly Hilton complex has long been the epicenter of the Golden Globes action. (Angelina Jolie made her famous post-show leap into the hotel’s Aqua Star Pool here in 1999, and George Clooney and Brad Pitt are frequent visitors, according to a hotel spokesperson.) In addition to hosting the awards ceremony itself, the hotel was also the main after-party destination, hosting events for HBO, Fox, NBC Universal, Netflix and the Weinstein Company, and Warner Brothers and InStyle. \nDuring Oscars week, Denzel Washington, Mandy Moore, James Corden and Darren Criss will be on site for an impressive lineup of parties, lunches and award ceremonies. \nCelebs who choose to stay on-site frequent the Penthouse Collection rooms on the 8th floor of the Wilshire Towers, which contain 16 luxury suites ranging from 830 to 3,750 square feet. Rooms are equipped with a virtual concierge service so stars don’t need to leave, but those who do can indulge in a beauty treatment invented just for the event: the Red Carpet-Ready facial.

Every nominee who checks into the hotel receives one, according to a hotel spokesperson. Sarah Jessica Parker even shared hers on Instagram . Courtesy Sunset Marquis \nSunset Marquis \nCelebrity guests including Kerry Washington , Pharrell Williams and Billy Bob Thornton , who took home the Golden Globe for Best Actor – Television Series Drama, have all stayed at this West Hollywood haunt, which is an equally short limo ride from both the Beverly Hilton and the Dolby Theater, where the Academy Awards are held. \nStars checking into the exclusive address tend to occupy the 3,200-square-foot, two-story Presidential Villa, which boasts a private screening room, a grand piano and a dining room that can seat ten. Courtesy AKA Beverly Hills \nAKA Beverly Hills \nRenowned for it’s homey accommodations — including private-access townhouses — and luxury hotel amenities, AKA Beverly Hills is a favorite stay of Jennifer Lawrence , Empire director Lee Daniels and Richard Gere . \nRoom service aficionados also appreciate that they can order up from Wolfgang Puck’s Spago ( Justin Bieber and Julia Roberts are fans) while staying at the Beverly Hills property. Puck has not allowed this option at any other property, a spokesperson for the hotel says.

Leonardo DiCaprio , Nick Jonas and Lily Collins were on sight for a pre-Globes gathering. The hotel also boasts a steady flow of A-list guests year round. Most appreciate the privacy of the property, but not all: Justin Bieber once serenaded Selena Gomez with “My Girl” in the hotel’s lobby bar. \nThe Sunset Tower Hotel \nLong a trusty gathering spot in the city for extra-private celebs (Jennifer Aniston, Johnny Depp and Sean Penn have been spotted here), hotelier Jeff Klein’s Sunset Tower even has a famous maitre d’, Dmitri , who tends to the A-list visitors at the Tower Bar. The property was the site of Vanity Fair’ s Oscar party for several years (last year it was held at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills), but kept a relatively low profile during Golden Globes weekend, hosting only one public event for agency CAA. However, one of their biggest clients, Jimmy Fallen , was busy over at the Beverly Hilton hosting a party of his own with NBC. AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images \nChateau Marmont \nThe frequent celebrity haunt will host Vanity Fair and Barneys New York’s dinner in celebration of La La Land on Wednesday as well as their Hollywood Issue party on Thursday. During Globes weekend, Natalie Portman , Emma Stone , Barbra Streisand and Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel all attended the W Magazine and Audi party held here. The storied hotel has hosted every sort of Hollywood affair , from the scandalous to the downright musical-worthy: say, a Lady Gaga sing-a-long .
