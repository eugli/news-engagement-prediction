Police eventually caught the suspect red-handed while he was attempting to sell nearly half a kilo of the plants.\nPolice have since seized the illegal substances.\nThe suspect also possessed more than 600 grams of marijuana, including a large quantity of seeds. \nDuring the interrogation, the suspect confessed to harvesting the marijuana plants, and the case has been transferred to public prosecution. \nIn 2016, an Emirati man was sentenced to 10 years in jail for planting 38 marijuana plants in his Dubai villa and a Dh50,000 fine. According to Dubai Police, the majority of the plants were found on the ground floor of the villa and some of the plants had reached up to 1.5 metres in height.\nThe suspect had partitioned a room on the ground floor into three to grow the plants, and also possessed marijuana-drying equipment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T15:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:56:43.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
