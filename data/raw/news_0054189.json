Woman sent home from work for not wearing heels wins debate in parliament \nAt one point she was sending him 60 messages a day via email, Snapchat and WhatsApp, and on one occasion he had 27 missed calls from her. \nMorgan told him she was pregnant and that he was the father, sending him a baby scan she downloaded from Google. \nShe also sent nude pictures and asked him for sex before making the rape allegation. She was given a restraining order forbidding her from contacting Mr Grogan. She harassed her boyfriend (Picture: Cavendish) \nHe told police: ‘I thought after the restraining order was issued this would all be over with but it just seems to be going on and on. It’s stressing me out, I’m trying to move on and I’m sick of Jade trying to ruin things for me. \n‘I had hoped the restraining order would prevent this, I live in a different country, have a new job and Jade is trying to ruin this. Trains and flights cancelled as Storm Doris batters Britain with 90mph winds \n‘She has no reason why she can’t move on with her life as well. Some days she sends 50 to 60 messages. She keeps changing her number but I know it’s her because she sends me pictures of herself.’ \nAt Blackburn magistrates court Morgan, from Accrington, who is now engaged to another man wept as she pleaded guilty to harassment. \nThey referred the case to the crown court so that a harsher sentence can be given to her. \nChairman of the bench John Bolton told her: ‘Our powers are not sufficient to deal with this. Prepare yourself, you could quite easily be sent to prison for this. I don’t know how you feel but saying that anybody committed rape – I’m a man and I find that disgusting. \n‘A baby as well, it’s not nice to be faced with that whether you were joking or serious. Your solicitor said that it’s finished with so show that it’s finished with. You need to keep away from electronic devices, that might be the best thing.’ \nShe was released on bail and will be sentenced in April.
