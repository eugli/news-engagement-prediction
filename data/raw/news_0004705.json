It doesn't expect so many that it would have any difficulty providing the supports being offered. \nAn injunction put in place after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week that closed U.S. borders to people from seven Muslim-majority countries. \nLegal scholars point to constitutional and statutory challenges that could strike down the executive action that would affect some 218 million people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen over 90 days. The order also puts an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:25:09.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
