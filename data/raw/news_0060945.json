This team has the capability of winning a Test series abroad,\" Sehwag said at the 'SporTale', sports-themed literary festival. \n\nSehwag, however, warned the Indian team against the law of averages catching up. \n\n\"This team has been playing fantastic cricket. They have won 8 of their last 9 Tests and that is a great achievement. But the law of averages catches up with every team and in my reading, there will be a Test in this series where the bowling might not fire or the batsmen will slip up,\" he said. \n\nThe 38-year-old Sehwag heaped praise on Indian captain Virat Kohli , terming him the best player in all three forms in world cricket at present. \n\n\"Virat has matured hugely. He is a world-class player and I think that he might break all records in a format by the time he calls time on his career,\" he said. \n\nSehwag also said that off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin had a realistic chance of becoming the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket provided he takes care of his body and fitness. \n\nOn Mahendra Singh Dhoni 's removal as skipper of the Rising Pune Supergiants , Sehwag said that it was a sad decision. \n\n\"I am happy that he isn't captain because maybe now my team, Kings XI Punjab, can beat this Pune team. On a serious note, I believe that this is an internal decision of the franchise but he is one of the best ever captains India has ever had,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:40:20.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
