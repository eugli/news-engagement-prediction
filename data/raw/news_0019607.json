If you do this long enough, you kind of understand snakes and what they do during certain times of the year.”\nView photos\nThe home was cleared of 24 snakes in total – including the dead one in the toilet (Facebook/Big Country Snake Removal) More He added: “With rattlesnakes, western diamondbacks in particular, they’re real communal animals during cooler months.\n“They tend to live together in dens.”\nAmong the 10 rattlesnakes under the house were five babies – and fortunately Hawkins caught them all before they could cause more toilet traumas.\nAnd, unlike the one found in the toilet, the rest will be relocated or donated to local colleges for study.\nAlarmingly, Big Country Snake Removal said on a Facebook post about the incident: “Just because you don’t see them doesn’t mean they aren’t there…”\nThanks for that.\nTop pic: Facebook/Big Country Snake Removal", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tqiDj8iltr9TWmacphcLVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NTg2O2g9NTM4/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/e1eb51e224c50507a3a3a871672b10a4", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UbNbFfk4RlOs.Oqh8mSQuw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NTAzO2g9NDE1/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/cc1112fd919be3a0c2ec428f6987afa7);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/T8EP2Qzhn3YnNtjJcvl07Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NTEwO2g9NDQw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/cfdea933ebf6a6f1cbd4ef452c2a16c8", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/T8EP2Qzhn3YnNtjJcvl07Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NTEwO2g9NDQw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/cfdea933ebf6a6f1cbd4ef452c2a16c8);", "https://www.facebook.com/Bigcountrysnakes/?hc_ref=SEARCH&quot;", "https://www.facebook.com/Bigcountrysnakes/?hc_ref=SEARCH", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UbNbFfk4RlOs.Oqh8mSQuw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NTAzO2g9NDE1/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/cc1112fd919be3a0c2ec428f6987afa7", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/family-finds-rattlesnake-in-toilet-then-two-dozen-more-underneath-their-house/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/family-finds-rattlesnake-in-toilet-then-two-dozen-more-underneath-their-house/"], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:57:21.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
