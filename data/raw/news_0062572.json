He said fruits and vegetables could be traded during the lean periods in the country. \nHe also reminisced about his time in Meghalaya where he was trained during the Liberation war and said he used to enjoy canned pineapple during his stay there. \nHistorically, Bangladesh and the neighbouring Indian states have been part of a sub-regional economy. \nThe High Commissioner said they were trying “to re-energize this sub-regional economy by opening the borders to trade and improving sub-regional connectivity and trade infrastructure”. \n“There is great potential for creating cross-border value chains in different sectors,” he said, adding that “already we have a great example of this on the Meghalaya-Bangladesh border where Lafarge Surma Cement imports limestone from Meghalaya using a cross-border conveyor belt for its cement plant close to the border in Bangladesh”. \n“Products of Pran Group from Bangladesh, which has also invested in Tripura, are already doing very well in our Northeastern states”. \nHe said tourism in the northeast is another area which holds “great potential”. \n“The eight states in the Northeast offer a wide variety of landscapes and wildlife, and also great cultural diversity”. \nHe hoped that the interactions during the conclave would generate “new opportunities” for the business community in the both the countries. \nMore than 60 traders of horticultural items and representatives of the tourism industry from Bangladesh are participating in this event to see what is being offered by the Northeastern states.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:13:49.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
