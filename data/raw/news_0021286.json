Mr. Morrin said it could be explained by two competing weather patterns: cold air masses descending from the North that will push out a low-pressure, warm air mass in time to chill the city and turn precipitation to snow. “Air masses move,” he said. “It’s just the timing.” At Cozy Coffee in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, patrons headed straight for the back patio, where owner Migdalia Medina ran cups of coffee and small plates of food plates to people seated at picnic tables under a canopy of bare tree branches. “As soon as they feel it they start coming out,” Ms. Medina said of her customers. As for Thursday’s forecast, she said the patio seating “also looks good under snow.” The New York weather historian Steve Fybish, who keeps records of the city’s weather dating to the 19th century, agreed that the weather swing was not unusual. He rifled through his records to find other days of similar extremes: a snowstorm and a 70-degree afternoon within a couple of days in 1984; 69 degrees on a November day followed by five inches of snow in 1896. In February 2014, when the Super Bowl was at the Meadowlands, in East Rutherford, N.J., the weather swung sharply. While there had been concerns that the outdoor game at MetLife Stadium would be affected by the cold, game day registered a mild 49 degrees at the stadium and 57 degrees in the city. But the next day, the temperature plunged to 27 degrees followed by a cold snap that was punctuated by eight inches of snow. On Thursday, the snowfall is likely to be heaviest during the morning commute, Mr. Morrin said. “I don’t think there’s going to be anyone rushing anywhere,” he said. “The commute time will be impacted.” \nReporting was contributed by Arielle Dollinger, Christopher Mele, Sean Piccoli and Jonathan Wolfe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:08:32.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
