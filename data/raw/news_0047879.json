But, really proud of our young men to find a way to win. Not easy to do against a really good team like Syracuse. I thought we really defended well for most of the game, but especially that second half, and you look at those numbers defensively, we did a nice job. Syracuse, like I said, is really good. They’ve got good players and, obviously, coach (Jim) Boeheim is one of the greatest ever. Heck of a win for us. The crowd was great once again. The crowd just gave us a tremendous lift. The student section was awesome.”\nOn starting poorly on offense:\n“First of all, you can’t simulate their zone in practice and so, last couple of practices, you’re not able to simulate it, so we weren’t really good to start. Like Quinton (Stephens) said, we just stayed with the game plan and we kept doing things the right way and stayed the course and things worked themselves out. We got some of our offense through our defense. We really guarded.”\n“This group of guys is a special group of guys. From where they were in April to where we are sitting on February 19, just a tremendous lesson for me – for me – a lesson for me and anyone else involved about what a team can do and how a team when it’s together, the kind of success you can have.”\nOn the screening foul called against Syracuse in the final minute:\n“He did a good job fighting over the screen, but it was the right call. That’s the bottom line. It was the right call, and Brian Kersey, the head of the officials, has done an amazing job in the ACC. And this is whether we win or we lose. I really do believe the officials in this league are tremendous.”\nOn slowing down Syracuse after a 10-0 run late in the first half:\n“We just talked about it. Our transition defense was poor. We had no sense of urgency. We had no sense of urgency. And then when we were getting back, we were running by Andrew White. Like, what are you doing? He’s one of the best 3-point shooters in the country.”\nOn Ben Lammers:\n“I think he could be the most improved player in the country.”\n“We have to be near perfect in execution, energy and effort, and at times we were perfect. That’s why we won the game.”\nOn Josh Heath:\n“Josh has been solid and sound for us pretty much for all year long. I’m extremely proud of him. He’s been a warrior for us all year. He’s been good.”\nJim Boeheiem\n“We didn’t get as good of movement against our matchup as we needed to. When we got some good looks, we missed. We got it inside to Tyler Lydon and he had two really good looks right around the basket. I thought he got fouled, but that’s the way it goes sometimes. Can’t miss those when you are in tough games. Can’t do that.”\n“We missed some open ones. We didn’t shoot well. We’ve been a good shooting team and we depend on shooting well from the 3-point line. If we don’t shoot well there, that hurts us. I thought John (Gillon) had good looks, but the ball didn’t go in.”\nOn the screening foul:\n“I don’t talk about calls.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:47:26.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
