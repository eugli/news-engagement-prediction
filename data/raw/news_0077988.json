Specifically, the new smartphone has been equipped with a new Motion Eye camera that able to shoot slow motion video at 960 frames per second. This apparently made possible by the camera’s memory stacked Exmor RS image sensor. \nAt the same time, the camera also features another interesting feature called Predictive Capture which allows it to activate image buffering even before the camera button is clicked. This is done via motion detection and it able to capture four shots at a time. \nBeing a high end model, the rear camera of Xperia XZ Premium also comes with 5-axis image stabilization and G Lens. On the front of the phone, there is also another 13-megapixels Exmor RS sensor that is paired with a f/2.0 22mm wide angle lens.
