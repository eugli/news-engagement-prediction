Story continues below \n“It’s a lifetime of work and dedication to the game,” Moulding said. \n“I have devoted a lot of my life and built my life a certain way where I’m lucky enough to do this.” \nHe started to make ice for the Lethbridge Curling Club when he was 14 years old. Now he works at the rink full-time, allowing him to take leaves to curl at major competitions. \n“The support of the curling club can’t be overstated… When I’m home, I do my best to give back,” Moulding said. \nHe gives back not just by making ice, but also helping the next generation of players. \n“He taught me everything to do with my slide, I have a totally different slide than everyone,” 17-year-old curler Cole Swarbrick said. “I didn’t think I could do that but I can and that’s because of him.” \nThe Brier runs March 4 until the 12. \nWith Alberta winning 10 of the last 16 Brier competitions, Moulding is hoping the odds are in his favour. \n“My ultimate goal is to win the Brier.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
