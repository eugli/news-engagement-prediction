What hasn’t been said is that after another contestant on the show mentioned that he was raising money for a project in West Kenya, Michael got in touch and made a donation of £99,000 to this small organisation working with victims of HIV/Aids, called Omwabini , which means rescue.\nThe initiative of Mary Bunyasi, Omwabini has grown from a few volunteers to an institution that accommodates and educates 500 children orphaned by Aids. Orphans were initially given help to become self-sufficient – the problem became such that to provide accommodation was the only solution. We set up Friends of Omwabini in the UK many years ago.\nGeorge Michael’s large donation in 2009 made a huge difference to the project. It is a delight to be able to share with others his great generosity.\nMusic Charities Voluntary sector Kenya Africa obituaries ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmusic%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F26%2Fgeorge-michael-obituary-letter%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;wwc=1", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Letter%3A%20George%20Michael%E2%80%99s%20generosity%20has%20changed%20lives%20in%20Kenya&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmusic%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F26%2Fgeorge-michael-obituary-letter%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmusic%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F26%2Fgeorge-michael-obituary-letter", "http://www.omwabini.org/", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmusic%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F26%2Fgeorge-michael-obituary-letter%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Letter%3A%20George%20Michael%E2%80%99s%20generosity%20has%20changed%20lives%20in%20Kenya&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmusic%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F26%2Fgeorge-michael-obituary-letter"], "published": "2017-02-26T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T15:05:11.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
