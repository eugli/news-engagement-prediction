Talking to American TV show ET , Britney's dad, Jamie Spears , confirmed his grandchild had been involved in an accident, saying, \"All I can say is pray for our baby Maddie.\" \nGALLERY: Celebrity parents and their lookalike children \nEarlier that day, news outlet TMZ reported the child had been riding in a Polaris ATV during a hunting expedition, when it flipped unexpectedly. But the exact details surrounding the accident are as yet unknown, with the Spears family issuing a statement refuting some of the claims in TMZ's original news story. \"The details the media are reporting surrounding the incident regarding Jamie Lynn's daughter Maddie are incorrect,\" a spokesperson for Jamie Lynn said in a statement. \"Right now the Spears family asks that everyone respect their privacy during this time and appreciates all the prayers and support for their family.\" A video posted by Jamie Lynn Spears (@jamielynnspears) on Jan 30, 2017 at 8:00am PST Jamie Lynn shared this picture of Maddie six days ago \nGALLERY: The most stylish celebrity kids \nMaddie was born when Jamie Lynn was just 17 years old. Her father is Jamie Lynn's ex-boyfriend Casey Aldridge . Jamie Lynn has spoken about her little girl in the past, telling People magazine, \"She's got such a sweet little heart. I feel like I've raised her with a lot of honesty, but I've also raised her with a lot of love. She's a very happy, content little girl, and there's nothing more a parent could ask for. That's my most proud accomplishment out of anything and always will be.\" \nJamie Lynn and big sister Britney are extremely close. Last year the pair shared sweet photographs of themselves having a girls' day out at the spa, enjoying some peaceful time off. They often holiday together, with their respective kids. The sister pair spent last easter with Maddie and Britney's kids Sean Preston and Jayden in Hawaii. \nWe're wishing Maddie a speedy recovery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:58:02.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
