We're hoping to show that love is love, so that things like this don't happen.\" \nMr Harris and co-author Adam Reynolds turned to Kickstarter to crowdfund the illustration , design and printing of the book last year. \nAfter raising well over the required $NZ25,000 ($22,500), the pair set about making their book into reality, using the additional funds to create an audiobook. \n\"We weren't really represented in the types of stories you usually read growing up. So it was something I became passionate about,\" Mr Harris said. 'Where was this when I was a kid?' Photo: Adam Reynolds (L) and Chaz Harris (R) wrote Promised Land.

This guy in the US told his friend who is gay about the book and after the friend read it he told him to thank us for writing this. \n\"I heard another story of a man in the UK commenting 'where was this when I was a kid?' … hearing things like that are really powerful.\" In November 2016, Tyrone Unsworth killed himself after years of homophobic bullying. He was 13. His school claims it knew nothing, but the warning signs were there. \nMr Harris admits there are always detractors and some have criticised the book for being \"sexual\". \n\"Some people have come out with some really odd ideas about what the book is about. They say it is sexual … but there is no sex in the book,\" he said. \n\"It is about the love between two men. The boys meet as adolescents and become best friends … it isn't until they are older that they realise that their friendship might be something more. \n\"In that way it promotes a much healthier relationship rather than the 'love at first sight' storylines that are common in other fairytales.\" More than one meaning Photo: The female characters in particular have been recognised for breaking traditional gender roles.
