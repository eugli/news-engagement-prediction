Ad Feedback \n\"We can't afford to have a new ministry built that doesn't address those issues and continues to repeat the mistakes of the past,\" she said. \nBoth English and Social Development minister Anne Tolley maintain that's it's possible for children to stay connected with their culture without being placed in family care. \nThey've got support in NZ First leader Winston Peters who agrees there's no place for a \"whanau first\" approach. \n\"I've known of too many children thrown from pillar to post between whanau members. I also know of hundreds of Maori who have been massively successful because they were lucky to have relations who would look after them. \n\"But to apply a blanket whanau-first principle just does not in the circumstances make any sense,\" Peters said. \nHistory has already resulted in a \"stolen generation,\" said Fox. \n\"Children who were put into state care immediately went to the bottom of every disparaging statistic in this country. They immediately are more likely to offend, more likely to be in prison, more likely to fall out of education.\" \n\"It is true 63 per cent of children in CYF are Maori and 71 per cent of youth in prison are Maori. We are the mainstream - stop building a department that has a Maori issues paper to the side and build it with a kaupapa Maori focus that will make real change for the lives of these children,\" Fox said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:21:49.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
