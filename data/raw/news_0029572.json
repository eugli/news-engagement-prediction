It takes a lot of skill and discipline to convincingly play a character, whether it's for movies, television, the stage or even a video game. Still, no one said you can't have fun during the process. As most blockbusters do with their home media release, Doctor Strange will include a blooper reel, and Marvel has posted a snippet of the hilarity that ensued during shooting. Check out the lighter side of the Dark Dimension with this blooper reel. #DoctorStrange comes to Digital HD Tuesday! pic.twitter.com/2eznDo0beP â€” Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) February 12, 2017 \nPosted on the official Marvel Studios Twitter page , this clip from the Doctor Strange gag reel offers a taste of the shenanigans that occurred when the movie was in principal photography from late 2015 to early 2016. The video kicks off with an unusual conversation where Tilda Swinton is the mother to Benedict Cumberbatch's baby. From there, we see some instances of Cumberbatch practicing proper spell casting moves, one of which devolves into him showing off his dancing. Add in some line flubs, and you have plenty of funny Doctor Strange unplanned moments to last you until the movie is officially released for home consumption. \nThis clip is only 50 seconds, but rest assured, the full Doctor Strange blooper reel will be longer. These kinds of videos usually last for several minutes, so expect to see a lot more unplanned goof and gaffes when you're browsing through the Doctor Strange special features. Personally, I'm expecting that there will be a minute or two of the cast making ridiculous faces as music plays. You can usually expect to see those in big blooper reels. Some of the other extra content that will be included on the home release include deleted scenes , A Strange Transformation , The Fabric of Reality , The Score-cerer Supreme , an exclusive look what's coming up in Marvel's Phase Three and Part Two of Thor 's adventures with his roommate Darryl, Part One being shown last summer. \nOfficially pulling the curtain back on magic and mysticism in the MCU, Doctor Strange followed Stephen Strange as he went from accomplished surgeon to rookie sorcerer following a car accident that permanently injured his hands. Desperate for a cure, Strange instead found a different calling in life as he learned how to conjure spells and access alternate dimensions. After successfully defeating Kaecilius and preventing Dormammu from destroying our reality, Strange is scheduled to return later this year in Thor: Ragnarok , and he'll be back in 2018 as one of Avengers: Infinity War 's many participants. \nDoctor Strange will be available on Digital HD starting tomorrow, and the Blu-ray /DVD release follows on February 28.
