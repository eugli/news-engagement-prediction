Queen of Peace junior Erin Foley plans to finish her high school career at St. Laurence. (Tony Baranek / Daily Southtown) Privacy Policy \nThere were tears again on Tuesday at Queen of Peace. \nJunior basketball player Erin Foley felt the urge during her first period biomedical science class. She was (sorry teacher) checking out an email on her laptop and reading a message sent out by St. Laurence. \nThe words made her heart skip. The all-boys school next door was going coed, and would be accepting any and all girls currently attending Queen of Peace after it closes in June. \nFoley eagerly whispered the news to the girls sitting by her. That got the teacher's attention. Finally, the message was relayed to the whole room. \n\"It was super exciting,\" Foley said. \"Everyone was so happy. Some were crying tears of joy, they were so excited.\" \nGuess where Foley is going next year? \n\"Oh, definitely there,\" Foley said. \"A lot of my friends will be going. That's one of my main concerns, to be with the girls I've been with for the past three years.\" \nTo say nothing of being with her basketball teammates. Wednesday's game saw a lot of smiling faces among Pride players, who are in the home stretch of the winningest season in Queen of Peace history. \nThe only concern was the language of the message St. Laurence sent out. It indicated after-school activities would be offered to incoming students, but it wasn't specific about sports. \nSophomore point guard Jovanna Martinucci had one of those concerned looks. \n\"I'm happy for a lot of the (nonathletes) who have nowhere else to go,\" she said with a sad look on her face. \"They love each other and they can go next door. But for me it's a question of basketball. Will they have a team? Who will be the coach?\" \nOK then, I proposed, what if they do have a team and keep George Shimko? \n\"The big man? Yes, I'd consider going. Absolutely yes,\" Martinucci said, eyes brightening. \"It would be pretty cool. A lot of the girls are really happy about staying together. And it would be really, really awesome if I got to stay together with them, especially for their senior year.\" \nShortly after talking to Martinucci, I talked with St. Laurence athletic director Tim Chandler. He was about as specific as one could get just a day after such a monumental decision. \n\"It's definitely our goal for next year to have sports teams,\" Chandler said. \"We're in the early stages of everything, but it's absolutely our intent to offer extracurriculars and try to offer some successful athletic programs just like we have on the boys side.\" \n\"I'm excited for a new opportunity to have additional sports and having the girls athletics complement the boys athletics that we already have here.\" \nThe sooner it gets etched in stone, the better. For junior forward Shannon Wilbourne, it would keep her window of college opportunity open. \n\"Right now I'm thinking about myself and my future in basketball,\" Wilbourne said. \"It will affect what high school I go to. If we were able to have the team go over to St. Laurence and play, that's the ideal situation.\" \nAs for Shimko's future, Chandler didn't make promises but indicated he was definitely in the mix. Shimko said he is definitely interested. \nI'm not telling them what to do, but this decision is a slam dunk. The transition of the Pride basketball program over to St. Laurence couldn't be placed in more capable hands. \nMeanwhile, cheers to St. Laurence. What compassion. What generosity. What fellowship. What a great neighbor. \nYou have much to be proud of. \nSpeaking of Pride, about that nickname... \nTwitter @tbaranek", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:29:11.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
