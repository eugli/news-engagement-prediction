Photos: Migrants head to Europe in the cold Photos: Migrants head to Europe in the cold On a freezing cold morning, with temperatures below zero Celsius, large groups of refugees were coming to Serbia from the direction of Macedonia and Greece. A train leaving from Gevgelija, Macedonia, brought them close to the border crossing, from where they have to walk additional 5 kilometers (3 miles) to reach a registration camp near the village of Miratovac in Serbia. Pictured here, a man named Asim tries to protect his daughter from the cold on the road from the registration center. They traveled for seven days from Turkey to get to this point.

Hungary: Asylum seekers face detention A migrant is overcome by tear gas after Hungarian police repelled an attempt to pull down a razor wire border fence. The Hungarian parliament introduced a bill on February 14 that requires the police to deport any person who is in Hungary illegally, without allowing any access to an asylum procedure, according to a written statement by the NGO The Hungarian Helsinki Committee . The bill also requires all asylum applications to be automatically held in detention until their claim is processed, according to the NGO. The NGO describes the proposed changes as \"extreme and flagrant violations of European Union asylum law.\" Hungary wants its people to hate refugees \"In the last two months, 1,600 cases of illegal push-backs from Hungary and Croatia have been alleged by refugees and migrants, who've been forced -- often violently -- back into Serbia, despite already crossing its border,\" the NGO said in a report. According to the UNHCR, Hungary recently cut the number of asylum seeker applications allowed at its border crossings from 20 per weekday to 10. \"The Hungarian authorities are doing everything they can to keep people out,\" said Amnesty International's Todor Gardos.

PIC says the amendment to the country's Aliens Act means \"all persons arriving irregularly and expressing an attempt for asylum would be forcefully returned without their asylum claims being heard.\" Prime Minister Miro Cerar has hinted that such measures could be introduced in the near future . \"We cannot allow a repeat of such mass migrations as we experienced earlier,\" he insisted at a press conference . \"Our country will help for as long as it has available capacity but then it will have to resort to other measures.\" The UNHCR has expressed deep concern about the law, which it says \"jeopardize[s] the rights of those fleeing war and persecution to seek asylum.\" Poland: Illegal migrants face expulsion JUST WATCHED ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:00:47.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
