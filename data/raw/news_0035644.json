Who is this man seen walking away from where bodies of two girls were found? \nSuspects in Germany are often only identified in the media by their first name and the first letter of their surname. \nBut in this instance, the defendant’s full name was given, so he was allowed to cover up his face, reports Mail Online . \nHe was ordered to be shackled in court due to his violent past, which landed him in a psychiatric facility. The man was given permission to cover his face to protect his identity (Picture: Joerg Bergmann/BILD) He was also shackled due to his violent past (Picture: Joerg Bergmann/BILD) \nIt was during this time he was able to gain access to the internet and dupe the ‘psychologically fragile’ girl into sex, the court heard. \nHe allegedly abused her 23 more times in a hotel and open air sites. This tweet is coming back to haunt Donald Trump \nBut Baumann denies the abuse and claimed he did nothing more than hold her hand. \nDefender David Schneider-Addael-Mensah brought along alleged love letters from the girl, adding: ‘There were no sexual acts between them. The state is mixing itself in a relationship that never was.’ \nWhy Baumann was allowed to leave the psychiatric facility and meet the girl is yet to be made clear. \nThe teenager is expected to testify in court on March 7.
