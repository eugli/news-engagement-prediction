A former facilities manager told authorities the general manager said Golfland was going to ignore the law. \nCourt documents show Garcia used a social security number that didn’t belong to her, though the complaint doesn’t say whom it belonged to. Garcia’s family members and her attorney say she made up the number. \nGarcia also used an alien registration number — identification for permanent legal residents — that belonged to a 55-year-old man. \nNo evidence was presented that individuals were harmed by the use of the Social Security number or alien registration number. \nGarcia avoided trial by pleading guilty to a felony charge of criminal impersonation. She was sentenced to two years of probation and ordered not to remain in the U.S. if she was voluntarily deported. \nMeanwhile back in the US: Now, more than ever, #SF stands by our status as a #sanctuarycity . We will defend the rights of all our residents. https://t.co/w18kr6771Z \n— Mayor Ed Lee (@mayoredlee) February 11, 2017 After the recent @ICEgov raids in #SoCal , our #SanJose community must know that the @SanJosePD will not participate in any ICE investigation pic.twitter.com/6jV175SUhq \n— Sam Liccardo (@sliccardo) February 11, 2017 Please forward me any videos, photos or other documentary evidence of the ICE raids, including any evidence of random citizenship checks. \n— Joaquin Castro (@JoaquinCastrotx) February 11, 2017 ICE should be held accountable for exactly who they are going after and why.
