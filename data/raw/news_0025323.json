West Virginia exited signing day with some pressing needs still left to fill on the roster and the Mountaineers took a big step in addressing one of those with the commitment of Syracuse graduate transfer Corey Winfield during his official visit.\nWinfield, was a two-year starter at Syracuse, finishing last season seventh on the team with 41 tackles and finished tied for the team lead with four pass breakups. He intercepted three passes in his career.\nHe was released from his scholarship at the end of the season and started to look at his potential options where he would spend next fall. That led him to West Virginia.\nThe St. Louis, Missouri, native took a two-day official visit to West Virginia and made the decision to spend his final season of eligibility with the Mountaineers next fall.\nWinfield also made official visits to both Purdue and UNLV, but West Virginia moved to the forefront in recent weeks edging out the Boilermakers.\nDefensive coordinator Tony Gibson served as the lead recruiter for Winfield and offered the cornerback prospect a scholarship offer in January. His connection there along with his official visit was enough to seal the deal and secure his commitment for the West Virginia football program.\nWinfield gives West Virginia an immediate impact player that already has starting time at the power five level and will be eligible this coming fall after he graduates from Syracuse in May to pursue a degree in finance.\nIt’s the latest example in a line of successful graduate transfers after Maurice Fleming made the same move last off-season from Iowa and started six games this past fall.\nThe Mountaineers had an immediate need at the cornerback spot after losing the top four options from last season’s team to graduation.\nWinfield was aware of the success that West Virginia has had with plugging one-year transfers into the program in recent years and that also played a role in his choice.\nWinfield becomes the second cornerback addition to the roster after junior college cornerback Hakeem Bailey signed with the Mountaineers in December and enrolled in January. The graduate transfer is one of what is expected to be several additions to the program post-signing day to fill out the roster.\nWVSports.com will have more with Winfield in the near future.\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/v8bu39fl2jw8rbywrg73", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/v8bu39fl2jw8rbywrg73)"], "published": "2017-02-11T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:54:35.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
