There was a lot of smoke and all the traffic had stopped. A couple of guys ran through the tunnel, they said ‘get everybody to back out! The cars behind us made way for a middle lane so cars could get through and get out of the tunnel. \n“I managed to back out of the tunnel in my car, but some people in cars in front had to get out of their cars and run out on foot.” \nA police cordon is in place in front of the Manchester Airport tunnel which has been closed due to a fire. \nWe'll be bringing you the very latest updates, pictures and video on this breaking news story. \nFor the latest news and breaking news visit Mirror.co.uk/news . \nGet all the big headlines, pictures, analysis, opinion and video on the stories that matter to you. \nFollow us on Twitter @DailyMirror - the official Daily Mirror & Mirror Online Twitter account - real news in real time. \nWe're also on Facebook/dailymirror - your must-see news, features, videos and pictures throughout the day from the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Mirror Online.
