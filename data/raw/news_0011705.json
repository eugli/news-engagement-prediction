But instead his consultant came in to see him last Wednesday with the bad news. \nThe consultant told him that his liver was playing up seriously and that he could no longer be treated safely. The next day she told him that the hospital would now be providing palliative care and “you better live every day as it comes”. \nHis ex-partner was in the room at the time with his children and his now wife, Rachel. It was his ex who suggested they marry. The staff on the ward helped organise the flowers and a registrar at short notice “just in case”. \nHewlett said of his new prognosis: “I’d kind of accepted at some level or other that the outlook was not good for me in the medium to long term. Of course you have hope and you do your best and I certainly wasn’t going to give up. \n“It took a little while for it to dawn on me what was really being said ... This could be it. This could be curtains.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:23:17.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
