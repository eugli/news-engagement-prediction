Social media pictures by her uncle and often chaperone Keith Kloss show that in 2008, she did a stint in Paris with him and her older sister, Kristine. Top model: The Chicago native is shown last December at the Fashion Awards in Los Angeles Cute kid: Karlie was a cute kid from the start Cheer team: The future supermodel stood tall among her fellow cheerleaders There she was like any other teenager, posing gleefully at Disneyland Paris – only a few pictures, including one of her still covered in stage makeup, hint that there was a future Victoria's Secret star in their midst. On the rare occasions she did return to conventional classes at Webster Groves, Karlie says her transition to in-demand model was hard for her classmates to understand. 'There was a lot of material for kids to tease me about,' she admitted in an interview with The Sunday Times in 2015. 'I'd go come back from Paris with bleached brows. My peers didn't read Vogue or care about fashion – to them I was a weird, tall alien.' Paris trip: Karlie is shown during one of her first trips to France with her sister Kristine at Paris Disneyland Family chaperone: The model's uncle Keith looked out for her in Paris Famous landmark: Karlie, Keith and Kristine posed in front of the Eiffel Tower Good times: The sisters smiled while in Paris together when Karlie was a teen Still, it's clear that Karlie – who is the world's eighth highest-earning model, raking in $8m in 2015 according to Forbes – managed to form treasured friendships at her suburban high school, which was also attended by sisters Kristine, Kimberley and Kariann. In the pictures she is seen clutching the arms of girlfriends at key school social events, including the annual black and white ball. Despite the fact that she was being dressed by the most coveted couture houses in her senior year, she was all too happy to throw on leopard print and a tutu for the annual line dance, not to mention a garish red t-shirt and gumboots on the school's 'tacky outfit day'. High school: Karlie and her sisters attended Webster Groves High School Popular gal: A high school gal pal planted a kiss on Karlie's cheek in a group photo Fashion statement: Karlie was shown wearing a funky outfit to school In an announcement that would shock no one, she was also decreed the school's best dressed in her senior year – a no-brainer given that by then, she had covered countless glossy magazine covers. She was also no slouch in the boy department. In 2010, a yearbook picture shows her looking thrilled to be in the arms of an unidentified young gentleman on the dance floor. Dance moves: The high school photos included a snap of Karlie dancing Tacky outfit: Karlie dressed up for Tacky Day with her friends And at her senior prom, she was on the arm of her childhood best friend, Gabe Smith, who insisted on paying for her ticket and picking her up in his dad's 2007 Ford Fusion. 'It looked pretty funny because Gabe was 5'6'' or thereabouts, and even in flats she towered over him,' says a source. 'She didn't care. She loves Gabe – they're still in touch. And anyway, despite his height, he was still one of the cutest boys in school.' These days, Karlie – who is more than just a clothes-horse with her studies at New York University and running her own Internet coding school called Koding With Klossy - is dating her boyfriend Josh of four years, 30-year-old multi-millionaire investor. Tall date: The model towered over her prom date Teen talent: A local newspaper wrote about Karlie and her modelling career when she was a teen She's almost as famous for her friendship with Taylor as she is for her modelling, and is a member in good standing in Taylor's famous 'squad'. Karlie lives in a Manhattan condo not far from bestie Taylor, and her dad, emergency room doctor Kurt and mom Tracy, have left St Louis for Goshen, upstate New York, a mere hour's drive from their girl. But this doesn't mean she's forgotten her roots. 'She still hangs out with the small group of girls who stuck by her in high school whenever she can,' notes a local. 'Everyone around here loves Karlie, she's never changed. She's such a lovely girl.' A member of the Webster Groves High School faculty adds: 'Karlie always helps us out. She's gotten our business students into places like Major League Baseball for class trips – no other school has ever been able to do that. She never forgot where she came from.'
