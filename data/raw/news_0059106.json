It was part of the prime minister's trip to assess implementation of government agricultural policies in the province.â€‰photo courtesy of Government House - + Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has urged Thai students in Si Sa Ket to study maths, science and English to meet growing demand as the country develops. \nSpeaking during a visit to Rasi Salai School to observe teaching methods yesterday, Gen Prayut encouraged students to study the three main academic subjects to fill a growing demand for human resources in several fields which will help boost the country's prospects. \nStudents should learn English as their second language to keep up with labour demand in today's borderless world, Gen Prayut said, adding children must have confidence in speaking English by \"thinking about and memorising things in their daily lives in English\". \nTeachers and parents should also encourage students to speak English all day once a week, the premier suggested. \n\"We have to consider what the country needs. Our country is faced with a shortage of scientists and engineers. Therefore, students should not opt to learn easy subjects similar to their friends because it will be difficult for them to find a job in the future,\" he said. \n\"They [students] have to work hard and learn how to think constructively. They must have creativity based on the correct principles taught by their teachers.\" \nGen Prayut also urged students to set career goals and wished them luck. \nHis visit was part of his trip to assess implementation of government policies in Rasi Salai district of Si Sa Ket.
