Arsenal’s Premier League win percentage since the start of 2015/16 With Cazorla – 65.2% Without Cazorla – 50% \nThe 32-year-old has featured in just 22 games since the start of last season out of a possible 63 games, which leaves the margin for error without him pretty darn high. \nWhat’s even more ridiculous about statistics like this is the lack of consideration for games he’s missing. \nTake this season for example. Cazorla featured in ‘big’ games against Liverpool, which they lost, and Chelsea, while his other Premier League fixtures included Leicester, Watford, Southampton, Hull, Burnley and Swansea. \nWhile the win against Chelsea, albeit against a wholly different proposition to what Antonio Conte’s side are now, was impressive, the rest are matches you would reasonably expect Arsenal to win, regardless of personnel. Cazorla has missed a large portion of games (Picture: AFP/Getty) \nFunnily enough, it’s no surprise Arsenal are dropping points against Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and at Everton away – they almost certainly would have done with or without him. \nA fairer comparison would be between the seasons with Cazorla in the team and the one in his absence. \nIn 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15, with Cazorla playing 30+ games in all three league campaigns, Arsenal finished fourth twice and third once. \nIn 2015/16, with Cazorla featuring in just 15 matches, Arsenal finished second. Go figure! Arsenal Premier League finishes and No. of points off the league winners 2012/13: 4th – 16 points behind Manchester United 2013/14: 4th – 7 points behind Manchester City 2014/15: 3rd – 12 points behind Chelsea 2015/16: 2nd – 10 points behind Leicester \nIn only one of those seasons were they any closer to winning the league in terms of points away from the eventual winners. \nThis man’s involvement would not bring Arsenal any closer to Premier League glory. \nYou may think at this point I don’t rate Cazorla but that honestly couldn’t be further from the truth. \nIndeed, it’s worth noting that Arsenal finished with fewer points in the season without him than with the three seasons in which he was a virtual ever present. Arsenal's recent Premier League points totals 2012/13 – 73 points 2014/15 – 75 points 2015/16 – 71 points \nBut the simple fact is Arsenal, with or without Cazorla, have not been good enough to seriously challenge for the Premier League title in recent times. \nAt best, there’s been an eight-point swing between the season without him (2015/16) and their strongest with him (2013/14). \nAdd those eight points to Arsenal’s final total in 2015/16 and it still wouldn’t have been enough for Wenger’s men to lift the trophy. \nCazorla has never won a league title in his career. And he’s never been deemed good enough by those who regularly win domestic championships to sign him.
