During the call, BioWare GM Aaryn Flynn said that the studio has been working on the game since 2012, and that the game would \"bring players together in exciting new ways.\" EA also called out the fact that the game wouldn't be an RPG. Previously, BioWare said that they were working on a game within a new universe, full of new characters, stories, and gameplay. \n\nOur Take This new IP is probably Casey Hudson’s old project . Considering the success of Destiny, we wouldn't be surprised if BioWare attempted something along those lines. However, the detail that the game won't be an RPG is interesting. Does EA mean that it won't be a traditional RPG, or that it won't be RPG focused? We'd find it strange if BioWare's new game didn't feature any kind of progression system. For further insight into the new project, listen to our interview with BioWare's general manager Aaryn Flynn – skip to the 20-minute mark to hear him talk about the new IP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:41:16.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
