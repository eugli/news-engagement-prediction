(Photo by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic) More There isn’t much that will get Janelle Monáe out of her signature black and white, but apparently the Oscars is on the list. While the actress did not stray far from her favored palette — a way to “pay homage” to her “working-class roots,” she has said — she added stunning gold and silver details in a straight-off-the-runway Elie Saab couture dress that’s the lovechild of the Black Swan and a fairy godmother. The black tulle gown is set with stones, crystals, feathers, and beads in silver and gold. The bodice is reminiscent of another classic Oscars Elie Saab dress: the sheer-and-floral look Halle Berry wore to take home the Oscar for Best Actress in 2002. Halle Berry’s Elie Saab gown, featuring a sheer top with floral appliqué and an attached iridescent skirt, will forever be remembered. (Photo: Getty Images) More One of Monáe’s themes this awards season has been accessories in unlikely places. She’s worn safety pins and pearls in her hair on the red carpet so far. Tonight, she upped — and glammed up — her own game with a braided gold headband. But she hasn’t ditched the flurry of accessories entirely, as this time, they’re right there on her dress. Isn’t it fun when stars have a personal style? Oscars watchers will get to see the look up close during the broadcast, as she’s set to be one of the night’s presenters. Even better, she starred in two of the movies nominated for Best Picture this year, Moonlight and Hidden Figures. No matter what happens, it’s clear Monáe is bound to have a great night.
