Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. President Trump said faith leaders should be able speak freely and without fear of retribution. Story highlights Jay Parini: Government neutrality on religious questions is something that makes us Americans It's not in the interest of any Christian to see the separation of church and state eroded, Parini says Jay Parini teaches at Middlebury College. He wrote \"Promised Land: Thirteen Books that Changed America.\" (CNN) President Donald Trump sends shock waves through the nation, around the world, every day of the week, and sometimes this is bluster that doesn't actually threaten America's deepest values. On Thursday, however, he went a large step too far by suggesting to a group of religious leaders that he would \"destroy\" the Johnson Amendment , which in 1954 prohibited churches and other tax-exempt organizations from supporting one party or candidate over another. Jay Parini By violating this law, they could lose their tax exemptions , and that loss would be crushing for most churches and charities. Do we really want to live in a country where religious organizations can benefit from special tax status and use the donations they receive for partisan purposes, especially in support of religious programs that we find repugnant or against our own faith values? In the mid-1950s , the Johnson Amendment aroused little concern. It was, after all, signed into law by President Dwight Eisenhower, a much-admired Republican, although it was named for senator (later President) Lyndon B. Johnson, a feisty Democrat.

Wood in Forbes, \"inviting questions about the separation of church and state.\" Let's dig into American history for a moment. One hears a lot about the \" separation of church and state ,\" and that's a critical divide, one that was implicit in the US Constitution. The phrase itself was used by Thomas Jefferson, and it's not explicitly written into the First Amendment, although it's implied. Indeed, the phrase itself was employed by the Supreme Court in 1878 and often used in subsequent years. No self-respecting constitutional scholar doubts that one of the hugely important matters for our Founding Fathers was to maintain this border, as many of our forebears had fled Europe because of religious oppression. One thinks back to Roger Williams , who founded the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. In his correspondence with John Cotton, a Puritan preacher, Williams famously wrote in praise of a \" hedge or wall of Separation between the Garden of the Church and the Wilderness of the world.\" He worried that allowing this hedge to fade would imperil religion itself, and the practice of faith, which is always an individual thing and should never be imposed or curtailed.
