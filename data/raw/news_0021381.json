Ignore the SEC standings, too. \nIf you told Rick Barnes before practice Friday afternoon that his Tennessee basketball team is 14-10 overall and 6-5 in SEC play, it'd be news to him. \n\"I'll tell you the honest truth, and I'm not lying to you, I have no idea what our overall record is right now,\" Barnes said. \"I have no idea. I don't look at standings. \n\"We don't put up standings up in (the locker room), we don't put up where we are. Because it's not about looking down the road to see where we are. It's about today and today only.\" \n  \nBarnes was asked if there's a certain number of wins he has in mind for his team to be assured a berth in the NCAA Tournament. \nObviously, the answer to that question is a blatant no. \n\"What's it matter?\" Barnes asked about the projections. \"I don't want to take away from the focus of what (my players) have to do. I want them to focus on what's at hand and what goes into winning. I don't want them to sit there and think, 'We have to win 20 games,' when the fact of the matter all we can control is what we control, which is what is in front of us. \n\"We have a chance today to get better in practice, we have a game tomorrow. Win or lose, we're still going to have opportunities with seven, eight, nine games to go in the regular season. Tennessee basketball coach Rick Barnes (Photo: Randy Sartin, USA TODAY Sports) \n\"There's no reason to worry about tomorrow,\" Barnes added. \"We just have to worry about today and do that. That's up to you guys to project and do all that stuff.\" \nTennessee, which hosts Georgia (13-11, 4-7 SEC) on Saturday (TV: ESPNU, 4 p.m.), is still hovering in the 30s in RPI. The Vols are 33 according to ESPN , 37 according to KenPom , 39 per the NCAA and 39 per CBS . \nAnd, Rick, if you're reading, your team is in the 68-team tournament field according to ESPN's Joe Lunardi (as a No. 12 seed), USA Today (as a No. 10 seed) and FOX Sports (again as No. 10 seed). \nThe Vols are out of the field and still off the bubble according to CBS Sports bracketologist Jerry Palm , who has Arkansas, Auburn, Wichita State and Clemson as his first four teams out of the field. \nTennessee's players see it, even if their coach prefers blissful ignorance. \n\"Yea, we see that a lot on social media,\" freshman guard Jordan Bowden said. \"They talk about it. We just focus on every game, trying to get better each game. We don't worry about it right now.\" \nIt would be news to Barnes, though. \n\"That's how I've always gone about my job,\" Barnes said. \"I don't want to think about a number. I just think this: If you win enough games, do what you need to do at the end, it will take care of itself.\" \nFor the next three weeks, that's the message. Going 1-0 as many times as possible. And, as many times as possible, be a better team after practice ends than before practice started. \n\"It's something we talk about with them,\" Barnes said. \"Our whole deal is about getting better. We talk about the game, but we talk about them, what they have to do as individuals right now to get better. Because the better they become as individuals, the better our team is going to be. \n\"That's what keep reminding them of. We keep hitting them with the same thing every day. It's about us getting better, us understanding what we have to do as a team and can we go out and execute it.\" \nWhen his press conference ended, Barnes was told his team is 6-18 through 24 games. He laughed while walking away. \n\"I guess we need to win, then,\" Barnes said. \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
