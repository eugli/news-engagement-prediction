It was something that really fascinated me.\"\nHe didn't immediately pursue the idea, but said a show this spring seemed fitting with federal legislation looming to legalize marijuana and dispensaries popping up all over the province .\n'The right time to explore this' \"It just seems to me it's the right time to explore this. I thought I'd throw it out there to see what the reaction would be.\"\nHe has already secured a number of pieces, including art by an American artist who creates works out of rolling papers. The exhibit will also feature political cartoons and a glass blower who creates art out of bongs.\nThe Grassland exhibit will feature works by glassblower Patrick 'Redbeard' Vrolyk. (Redbeard Glass/ Facebook)\nCrawford said he wants to highlight the politics of the issue and the creativity that comes out of cannabis culture.\n\"There's a guy in the States who is hired by Snoop Dog for $10,000 a month to roll joints in the shapes of helicopters and guns, but they're actually sculptures that are smokable.\"\n\"Regardless of what your opinion is, I want you to come out and say, wow, I had no idea.\"\nThe gallery also plans to host weekly marijuana forums with speakers, including police officers and health officials.\nThere is currently a public call for submissions â€” artists can submit up to four works for consideration by March 3 by emailing curator@pentictonartgallery.com.\nGrassland opens March 17 with an Alice in Wonderland-themed party and runs until May 14.\nWith files from Adrian Nieoczym .  \nGlassblower Patrick 'Redbeard' Vrolyk starts with simple glass bongs and creates elaborate pieces of art. He will be one of the artists showcased in the Grassland exhibit.
