Source: YouTube \nIn an interview with the Today Show , Norris revealed she headed to the City of Sin with a camera crew in tow who filmed her “just eating as much as I wanted at the buffets.”\nAnd the pint-sized pro was back on Ellen today, when DeGeneres treated us to the footage. \n“When I’m your friend, everybody treats me like a princess,” Sabre told the talk show host.\nShe also offered Ellen some sound advice on the tactical way of approaching buffet restaurants.\n“You’ve gotta eat more than what the price is, that’s how you win,” she told her. “So, if it’s $20, you’ve gotta eat $30.”\nHow to eat at buffets 101.

I feel really excited but I’m a little bit nervous. Sometimes it feels like I’m going to vomit.\nNorris reportedly became the second youngest ever to compete in World Surf League event.
