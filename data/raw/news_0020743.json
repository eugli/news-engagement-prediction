The president held the meeting Thursday with a small group of senators in a bid to build bipartisan support for his Supreme Court pick, Judge Neil Gorsuch. \nTrump frequently referred to Warren as Pocahontas during the presidential campaign because of her unverified claims during her 2012 Senate race to be part Native American, based, she said, on family stories. \nDuring the meeting, Trump said that Warren had claimed to be Native American because of her “high cheekbones,” a source told CNN, who added that the situation was “ bizarre and awkward .” \nTrump also referred to Warren being rebuked and silenced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Tuesday for attempting to read a 1986 letter in the Senate from Coretta Scott King critical of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who has since been confirmed as U.S. attorney general. (Protesters turned up outside McConnell’s Kentucky home Friday to read the letter .) \nWarren was a harsh critic of Trump during the campaign, calling him at one point a “thin-skinned racist bully,” and she remains so. She has been a vocal critic of his Cabinet picks and blasted his travel ban, turning up at Boston’s Logan airport to join protesters. \nThere was no immediate response from Warren to a request for comment from the Huffington Post. \nTrump has a history of clashes over Native American ancestry. When he was trying to build a casino empire, Trump accused competing Native American casinos of being fronts for the Mafia to get special tax breaks — and even claimed they weren’t really Native Americans. “They don’t look like Indians to me and they don’t look like Indians to Indians,” he said during congressional testimony in 1993. \nIn another uncomfortable moment at the meeting this week, Trump insisted again on his groundless claims of widespread voter fraud that he says hurt him and former Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) in the November election. Related Coverage Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post? Here’s how.
