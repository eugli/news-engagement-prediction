Image caption Michelle O'Neill has said she does not believe the public want to see US President Donald Trump in Northern Ireland \nSinn Fein's northern leader said this would have to be discussed in any negotiations after the election. \nMrs O'Neill defended herself against criticism that the Stormont agriculture department ran more than 50 seminars advertising the benefits of the RHI scheme when she was agriculture minister. \nShe insisted she had \"no hand in the design or the administration of the RHI scheme\" and promoted it \"in good faith\" at a stage when no concerns had been raised. \nShe claimed the focus on the seminars was part of DUP \"antics\" trying to deflect attention from their responsibility for the scheme. \nQuestioned about Martin McGuinness and Arlene Foster's joint invitation to the US President Donald Trump to visit Northern Ireland, Mrs O'Neill said she didn't think the public would want to see such a visit, due to his \"appalling policy decisions\". \nShe described the invitation signed by Mr McGuinness as \"a routine bit of business that any Executive would do\". \nSinn Fein's northern leader confirmed she would not go to President Trump's White House St Patrick's Day reception, because her priority would be on the negotiations at home. \nAsked if that applied to all her party's representatives, Mrs O'Neill said: \"There is no invitation to any Sinn Fein representative at this moment in time\".
