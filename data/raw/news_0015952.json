Greg Meagher, 57, raced into the Augusta Xytex sperm bank — twice — on Sunday after an emergency phone call that a worker was in distress. He was attempting to aid employee Anita Wiles, who was unresponsive, when Meagher was apparently overcome by a leak of liquid nitrogen, the Atlanta-Journal Constitution reported. An autopsy is pending. Wiles was in critical condition at a local hospital Monday night. \nA hazardous materials team responded and shut off two liquid nitrogen tanks at the facility. \nLiquid nitrogen, used to freeze sperm donations, quickly turns into a gas once released into the air, displacing oxygen . Victims are asphyxiated. \n“They were actually pumping him, like giving him mouth” to mouth, a sperm bank neighbor told WSBTV. “It was sad to see something like that.” \nThree other deputies who responded to the scene were treated for breathing difficulties at a local hospital and released \nColleagues and friends mourned Meagher, whom they hailed as a hero. His patrol car, parked in nearby Daniel Village, was covered in flowers and notes in a memorial tribute. He was an “ awesome man , awesome friend, father, community citizen,” friend Debbie Smith told WRDW TV. “You just don’t find a better man than that.” Investigators said Sgt. Meagher ran into that cloud of liquid nitrogen twice to try and save a woman. He died. She's in critical condition. pic.twitter.com/7RlpRY3zap — Richard Elliot (@RElliotWSB) February 6, 2017 \nHe was a 33-year veteran of the force, who survived being shot in the face in 2004 while assisting federal agents in a drug bust. \nThe company said in a statement: “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of Sgt. Greg Meagher, his fellow deputies and our injured employee.” \nInvestigators from the federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration were on the scene Monday, NBC reported.
