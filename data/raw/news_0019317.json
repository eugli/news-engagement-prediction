Who paid up? \nBut after the photo-opportunities and handshakes and ministerial convoys - who actually paid up? \nThe financial report shows that a year later Ireland has paid more than Saudi Arabia and Estonia has donated more than China - not as a proportion of their economies, but in hard cash. \nIn terms of both promises and delivery for funds in 2016, a quartet of donors made up a huge slice of what was supposed to be a global effort. Image copyright AP Image caption The Syrian war has pushed people across many countries \nThese are the US, Germany, the European Union and the UK - all of which have given more than they initially pledged. \nThe Netherlands, Japan and Norway are the next in this list of donors, but some way behind. \nAccording to this annual reckoning, Saudi Arabia pledged $200m (£160m) for 2016 and has so far committed to $27.9m (£22m). \nIn contrast, Ireland, promised $21.9m (£17.6m) for this Middle East conflict and has actually paid up $27.9m (£22m). \nChina promised $35m (£28m) and so far has delivered $3m (£2.4m). \nTo put that in context, the UK promised $731m (£584m) and gave $741m (£592m). \nCanada, Belgium and Spain have all given more than they pledged. Future funding? \nBut the long list of 48 donor countries and organisations for Syria in 2016, many giving a few million or hundreds of thousands, is overshadowed by the big contributions from the top four donors. \nThe next phase of this accounting - for pledges for 2017 to 2020 - gets even sketchier. Image copyright AP Image caption Refugees from Syria's war now living in Lebanon \nThe EU, the UK, Germany and Norway are the big long-haul donors - but a majority of those who made pledges for 2016 have not promised anything at all for the following years. \nThe world community has promised $6bn (£4.8bn) humanitarian aid up to 2020 - but Saudi Arabia and China are among those absent from the donors. \nAnd 60% of the total pledges are from the EU, the UK, and Germany. \nThere are a handful of countries who are donating even though they have not made pledges, such as Canada and Ireland. \nOptimists might take heart from the eventual level of funding for 2016 - where grants have exceeded the original promises by about a third. \nAnd of course there are other ways of donating directly or through charities that countries might choose. Who is getting aid? \nBut so far less than half of the promises at the London conference for 2017 to 2020 have been honoured - and in terms of the loans promised only 31% have been delivered. \nIt's also interesting to look at the detail of who is getting the money. Turkey is the second-biggest recipient in 2016, after Syria. \nAnd from 2017 to 2020, the biggest recipient of this \"Syrian\" support will be Turkey by some distance, ahead of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. \nTurkey is host to the largest number of refugees in the region, with the UNHCR reporting 2.8 million Syrian refugees registered in the country. Image copyright PA Image caption Gordon Brown warned of \"post-truth economics\" over aid funding \nApart from immediate humanitarian aid, a key aim of the fundraising has been to provide an education for all of Syria's refugees - with fears of the damage to a \"lost generation\". \nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a UN envoy for education, appeared before the International Development Select Committee a couple of weeks ago - and warned about what was at stake. \nIn righteous indignation, he criticised the broken promises that meant many young Syrian refugees had lost their chance of an education along with their homes. \nHe warned that half of all Syrian refugee children were not in a classroom - and many would never enter school at all. Extremism \nWhen it came to promises of aid, he told MPs: \"There is a post-truth economics as well as a post-truth politics.\" \nAnd despite the billion-dollar handshakes, he said, world leaders had not come up with the goods. Image copyright AP Image caption Syrian refugees housed in tents in Greece this winter \nThe price for this lack of education would be paid in increased migration, extremism, poverty and political instability, Mr Brown said. \n\"Of course, there will always be a battle publicly about how well aid is used,\" he told MPs. \n\"I will just give you one figure about education that people sometimes forget. \n\"Take all the aid agencies in the world together, including the Department for International Development, the World Bank, Unesco and Unicef, and the average expenditure per child in low and middle-income countries on education through aid, with all these agencies taken together, is less than $10 (£8) per head per year,\" Mr Brown told the select committee. \n\"This is less than the cost of a textbook, so nobody can say that we are overspending on aid for kids who are desperately in need of educational opportunity.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:50:38.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
