These figures underline why it was so vital to dismantle the Calais Jungle. \nThe French had allowed it to grow for years with 10,000 people living in the camp by last summer. That’s why we must keep the pressure on the French to stop the Jungle returning - before the first tent is pitched.” \nThe Daily Express submitted a Freedom of Information request to discover the number of migrants intercepted on the Continent. GETTY In June alone nearly 6000 migrants were caught at the border \nOur request was submitted on July 17 and should have been answered by August 16. The Home Office refused to provide an explanation for the lengthy wait, saying “regrettably, delays do occur despite our best efforts”. \nThe data was finally released this week as the Information Commissioner threatened legal action after confirming the department was in breach of the FOI Act. Officials made public the number of “clandestine entry attempts” but refused to disclose how many individuals had been caught using forged documents. \nAlthough it is not known how many migrants have made it here illegally experts say it is likely at least the same number are successful as are caught. \nUkip leader Paul Nuttall said: “Like many people I strongly suspect the numbers of migrants caught trying to get into the country has continued to rise since June last year and heaven only knows how many get in undetected. \n“It is essential we have both a sensible quota system for migrants who can bring the skills and expertise we need and to invest more money in our Border Force to ensure all those who are not welcome here are either stopped on arrival or caught and sent back.” \nHome Office figures show the number of migrants trying to reach Britain illegally has been rapidly rising, culminating in a record 84,088 stopped in 2015. \nYet just four months after the Jungle was ripped down refugees are returning to northern France at a rate of more than 100 a week with Francois Guennoc, vice-president of the Auberge des Migrants aid group, saying: “The migrants are coming back and government is in denial about the current situation in Calais.” \nThere are now thought to be at least six informal migrant settlements in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region and an official camp in Dunkirk. \nAlp Mehmet, vice chairman of Migrationwach UK, said: “These are worrying figures that show the continuing and unremitting pressure on our borders. The Government really must make sure those with the job of intercepting and dealing with would-be illegal entrants have the resources they need for this crucial task.” GETTY The majority of the migrants are thought to have been caught at the smuggling hotspot of Calais \nThe Home Office said: “These detections make absolutely clear that our approach to securing the UK’s border is working. \n“Despite our successes in preventing attempts to enter the UK illegally we are not complacent. We will continue to work closely with our French counterparts to maintain border security and keep legitimate passengers and trade moving.” \nNumber of illegal entry attempts detected at British border controls on the Continent in 2016: \nJan: 3,600 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:13:21.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
