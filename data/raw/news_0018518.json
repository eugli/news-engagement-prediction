The company announced Tuesday it will hold an event at Pala Alpitour in Torino, with Bellator 176 followed by Bellator Kickboxing 5. While the bulk of the Bellator 176 card, including the main event, has yet to be named, the company has announced two bouts: Carrington “Jetsetter” Banks (6-0) vs. Mihail Nica (5-0) at welterweight and Djamal Chan (12-3) vs. Valeriu Mircea (13-4) at lightweight. Bellator also announced the Bellator KB5 main event, as Denise Kielholtz (46-3) defends her Bellator KB flyweight title against ISKA and WKU champion Martine Michieletto (34-12-5) in the main event. Also, Giorgio Petrosyan (83-2-2, 1NC) will face Amansio Paraschiv (23-5-1). This mark’s the company’s second event in Italy, as Torino was the site of the company’s first-ever European event last year, an international expansion which was followed by cards in Britain, Ireland, Hungary and Israel.
