The mold for these leaf-shaped stones were actual Hosta and Rhubarb leaves. \nFrom Carol: \"Here's a pathway of stone made with rhubarb and hosta leaves. No need to buy a mold, just turn the leaf upside down and use leaf as a mold. Mix Topping Mix (fine cement) with water to a soft cookie dough and put it on the leaf. Pat it all over to bring up the water and to remove the bubbles. Put a layer of chicken wire on top of this. Mix concrete cement and put a layer on top of that. Hold your hand against the sides and pat the cement to bring up water and to seal all layers. The next day, turn the leaf over and peel it off. All the veins are in your leaf! Let it dry a few days before putting in the garden.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:55:43.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
