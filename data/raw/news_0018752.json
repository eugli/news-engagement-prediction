Advertisement \n\"Independent schools call on the Government to urgently resolve this issue,\" Ms Colman said. \n\"The Commonwealth government has made public assurances that the independent school sector would be consulted on proposed changes to current school funding arrangements yet with less than 12 months until the Government's current funding commitment ends and potential new arrangements are due to take effect, we have not seen any details.\" \nMs Colman said the private school sector was particularly vulnerable to funding changes because it cannot move money between schools. \n\"Sudden alterations to funding would affect schools' capacity to plan their operations going forward with confidence,\" she said. \nActing National Catholic Education Commission executive director Danielle Cronin said time had already run out to overhaul Australia's school funding system. \n\"The outstanding issues requiring attention in the school funding model will take more than a few weeks or months to address,\" she said. \n\"There is not sufficient time remaining to define, analyse and negotiate changes to the Schooling Resource Standard and understand the implications for all schools in advance of the legislative and administrative arrangements that would be required to implement a new funding model for the 2018 school year.\" \nSenator Birmingham, who met with the private school sector last week, said the government was sticking by its timetable to resolve school funding in the first half of this year. \nFunding for both public and non-government schools will continue to grow in coming years, he said. \n\"As a result of the 27 different funding deals struck by the previous Labor Government, we see the similar disparity and inequity in the funding the Commonwealth provides for comparable schools in the government sector as we do in the non-government sector,\" he said. \n\"Similar government schools should be treated consistently by the federal government wherever they are in Australia, just as similar non-government schools should be treated consistently by the federal government wherever they are in Australia.\" \nLabor education spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek called on Mr Turnbull to release his school funding plans because principals are \"growing anxious\" about the government's plans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T07:03:37.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
