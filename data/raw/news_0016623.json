Article continues below Watch: The moment Zlatan Ibrahimovic ended Christian Fuchs' career \nWell, the man himself, who has been vocal on social media in the past, has taken to Twitter once again to state his loyalty to the Red Devils. The post can be seen below: \nJudging from the Tweet, Martial seems rather happy at his current home, showing no signs of seeking a move away. \nOf course, little can be based on a simple social media post and inevitably the club could choose to offload the player themselves, because, as we know, Mourinho does not shy away from making controversial decisions. \nIn a recent interview with Sky Sports , the Portuguese manager stated that Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who endured a similar scenario at the start of the campaign, is now ahead of the Frenchman in the pecking order and now he must follow a similar route to his teammate. \n\"He has to perform better than the others who are competing for the same positions. \n\"His position is one where we have lots of options. Do you want me to leave Mkhitaryan out after being man of the match [against Wigan in the FA Cup] and playing so well as he did? I can't. \n\"The players pick themselves. I am just there to analyse what they do and try to be fair with them. Such a good performance, Mkhitaryan has to play [against Hull]. Simple.\" \nThe Armenian has usurped Martial in the rankings and with a goal and an assist against Leicester, it is likely to remain that way for the time being. \nHowever, the Frenchman seems to have pledged his allegiance to United and if the exit rumours really are false, it will be interesting to see how his situation develops. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
