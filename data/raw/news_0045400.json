The announcement was met with a certain amount of credulity as Yiannopoulos is affiliated with the alt-right movement. \nThings would take a turn on Sunday morning when an unflattering video of Yiannopoulos went viral. Conservative media group The Reagan Battalion was the first to post video to their Twitter page. The conservative group would also take the opportunity to take a shot at the American Conservative Union. 🚨 Breaking: We obtained the #CPAC2017 Milo Yiannopoulos introductory video. \nThis is a must watch! \n— The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) February 19, 2017 Here is a longer cut where Milo Yiannopoulos says that he “is advocating” for legal sex between 13 year olds! & older men. #CPAC2017 pic.twitter.com/1fiuv7TSKs \n— The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) February 19, 2017 \nIn the video, Yiannopoulos seems to be defending pedophilia: \nIn the homosexual world, particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men — the sort of ‘coming of age’ relationship — those relationships in which those older men help those young boys discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable, sort of rock, where they can’t speak to their parents. \nAn off-screen voice (possibly that of an interviewer) is heard commenting, “It sounds like molestation to me. It sounds like Catholic priest molestation to me.” Yiannopoulos is quick to reply, “But you know what? I’m grateful for Father Michael. I wouldn’t give nearly such good head if it wasn’t for him.” \nLater Sunday afternoon, Yiannopoulos took to Facebook to voice his disdain for the video making the rounds on social media as well as to defend himself. \nDeeply unamused by all of this is CNN anchor Jake Tapper . The host of The Lead took to Twitter after being reached out to by a concerned friend, who also allegedly happened to be a victim of sexual abuse as a child. Friend of mine, conservative, could not be more distraught by this Milo tape. Was molested as a child. Horrified. \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 20, 2017 My friend, a survivor of sex trafficking: “Milo straight up defended abusing 13 yr old boys…Please don’t let that be normalized” \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 20, 2017 More from survivor of sex trafficking: “Please please please don’t let that mess he said go away.” \nHow on earth can CPAC defend this? \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 20, 2017 Was planning on ignoring for the most part, for those saying “stop publicizing him.” But friend reached out & pled w me to say something \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 20, 2017 And sometimes that’s what journalists do – give voice to the voiceless. In this case, a survivor of sex trafficking HORRIFIED by Milo. \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 20, 2017 Preying on children is the definition of evil. Justifying it in any way is sick and disturbing. \nHas everyone lost their minds? \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 20, 2017 \n\nHave a tip we should know?
