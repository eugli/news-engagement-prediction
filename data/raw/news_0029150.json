Users anonymously fill out a short form on the website with information such as the type of incident, location and motive.\n\nIncidents recorded include vandalism, slur, threat and graffiti in regards to sexual orientation, race, disability or other issues.\n\nReporters will also have the option of suggesting how the incident should be handled and whether they want to be contacted by the committee.\nLast August, Jesse and Julia Lipscombe and Mayor Don Iveson  launched the #MakeItAwkward campaign after Jesse recorded a passerby yelling racial slurs at him. The video he posted went viral. \n\nThe Alberta Muslim Public Affairs Council says it has seen a spike in calls, since launching a toll-free hotline last year to report incidents of Islamophobia.\nChaudhry emphasized that it's still important for Albertans to continue reporting hate crimes and incidents to police. \nHe noted there are also other initiatives and spaces where like-minded people can connect with others on anti-racism efforts including the John Humphrey Centre for Peace and Human Rights and Make It Awkward Facebook page .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:09:24.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
