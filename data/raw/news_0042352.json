'I was being punished for speaking up' \nShe explained, instead of supporting her and her impoverished family reconnecting, the agency put her into a foster home. \n\"I was being punished for speaking up,\" she said.

(Supplied: Deb Moyle) \n\"They would say 'you're fair skinned, you don't have to go back there, you can move forward'.\" \nMs Moyle said after two years of being moved from one home to another, it took intervention by members of Parliament before she was eventually returned to her mother and reunited with her siblings and other relatives. \n\"Coming home to a unit filled with cousins, aunts and uncles was a culture shock, but it was a place I knew I needed to be,\" she said. \n\"I now had an identity. I am a Ngarrindjeri. I am a member of the Ngarrindjeri nation. That immediately connected me to family. I have all this belonging and acceptance.\" \nMs Moyle, now 50 with three daughters of her own, has worked her way up to become the most senior staff member in Aboriginal early childhood services. \nShe is dedicating her efforts to help her community break out of what she said could be a cycle of poverty, teenage pregnancies and sometimes abuse. Aunties House aimed at reducing foster care trauma \nSpeaking from her own experiences, she said it was difficult for her to \"unlearn\" the behaviours and attitudes that came with a disadvantaged childhood and this is what many Indigenous families struggled with.

Children do not have guidance or the ability to come back to their community like me and be welcome with open arms and be strengthened by cultural knowledge,\" she said. \nNow, Ms Moyle along with her daughters and three other Aboriginal community members, plans to set up a support service they will call Aunties House, offering temporary accommodation for young Aboriginal children who need family support. \nShe explained her aim behind Aunties House is to reduce the trauma experienced by children in foster care by surrounding them with familiar Aboriginal faces and ensuring they are guided by and remain connected to their families and culture. \n\"We have to keep ourselves grounded with culture. Where will those children learn to not carry that baggage? How do they learn to think about themselves differently?\" she said. \n\"We have to remind Aboriginal people that our culture is our strength.\" \nShe said Aunties House, which she anticipates will begin official plans within the next two years, will be another step to breaking the cycle of trauma experience by the many Indigenous children in foster care so they have the ability to reach their potential and not be held back by their past experiences.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:25:22.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
