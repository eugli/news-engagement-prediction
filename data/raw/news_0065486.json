Series creators David Benioff and Dan Weiss have come right out and admitted this sequence was the reason they wanted to make Game of Thrones in the first place. The Red Wedding \nHOME AND AWAY — THE DEATH OF SHANE PARRISH \nWas there ever a love story as beautiful as that of Angel (Melissa George) and Shane (Dieter Brummer) on the long-running soap? \nSure, they had ups and downs, but no moment on the show has gripped our hearts like seeing Shane collapse and die from blood poisoning while celebrating his first anniversary with Angel. He died back in 1996, and fans everywhere cried for days. Shane Parrish dies \nLOST — THE OPENING SEQUENCE \nA lot of drama went down across Lost ’s six seasons, but let’s never forget the big drama that kicked off the whole thing in the opening scenes. \nWe were introduced to the series with a crashed plane, a beach full of dangers, a crew of terrified survivors, and a hero doctor attempting to save them all. \nFrom that moment on, we were hooked. Lost episode 1 \nOFFSPRING — WHEN PATRICK DIED \nAussie dramas really love a shocking death. Right when we — and Asher Keddie’s character Nina — had fallen madly in love with the father of her baby, he had to go and get hit by a car. \nThe pregnant Offspring heroine was devastated at the loss of Patrick, and so were we. It had seemed like after years of false starts, Nina had finally found The One ... but clearly, the producers had a different idea. Patrick's shock death \nHOUSE OF CARDS — WHEN FRANK UNDERWOOD MURDERED ZOE \nIt was definitely curiosity that killed brash young journalist Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) in the gripping political drama House of Cards . Just when you thought you knew how far then Vice President Frank Underwood would go for his ambition, he went and — SPOILER ALERT — pushed her in front of a subway. \nIt was genuinely one of television’s most pure “WH T?” moments. Frank Underwood kills Zoe Barnes \nORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK — PIPER VERSUS TIFFANY \nOur sweet and non-confrontational heroine Piper Chapman left audiences with their jaws on the floor after her brutal bust-up with enemy and fellow Litchfield jail inmate Tiffany Doggett. \nGranted, Tiffany was insane and had been the one to corner Piper in the prison yard in an attempt to kill her, but still — who knew Piper had that in her? \nIt was such a violent altercation, many were certain Tiffany was dead, but as we’ve seen from the following seasons ... she’s still very much alive.
