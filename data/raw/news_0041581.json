It has to go forward.\"\nAsked if a loss would raise questions over Mr Corbyn's leadership, she said: \"No. No. There are people who've been opposed to Jeremy from the very beginning. I'm not one of them, and I think we have to go forward.\"\nShe blamed a \"sustained campaign\" by the media and some Labour MPs for poor polling, and said: \"I'm confident Jeremy will lead us into 2020.\"\nThe polls were prompted by the quitting of two Labour MPs to go to new jobs.\nDiane Abbott said the party would still be in the right position regardless of the result (Photo: Getty) Jeremy Corbyn campaigning in Stoke-on-Trent yesterday ahead of the poll (Photo: Getty) Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I think those two by-elections are not going to be easy by-elections.

I believe Labour can win both of these by-elections, but I think it will be tough and I believe it will probably be close. I believe every vote will count.\"\nOn Copeland, he said: “It’s been held by and large mostly by small majorities and then there are other challenges in Stoke.\"\nMPs with more centrist views than Mr Corbyn, including Peter Kyle and Liz Kendall, today insisted Labour would win the by-elections.\nAnd London mayor Sadiq Khan batted aside questions of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, telling ITV's Peston on Sunday: \"He’s won two leadership elections in the space of two years.
