The Hyundai Motor Group said last month it plans to lift U.S. investment by 50 percent to $3.1 billion over five years. \nLG Electronics Inc also announced in January that it will decide on whether to build a manufacturing base in the United States within the first half of the year and warned of risks from the Trump administration's trade policies.
