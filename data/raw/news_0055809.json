I was not impressed. I thought some of the choices weren’t very good,” Trump said after the 2013 ceremony during an interview with Fox News . That year, Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained won awards for best original screenplay and best supporting actor (Christoph Waltz). But Trump was not a fan. \n“ Django Unchained was probably one of the most racist movies I’ve ever seen. I thought it was terrible. A disgrace. When they talk about guns and gun control, that movie — people should watch that,” he said. “You want to talk about something, really, with a problem. But I thought it was terrible.” \nTrump also thought the show’s set was “terrible” and “tacky” and found fault with Daniel Day-Lewis’ Oscar-winning work as Abraham Lincoln in 2012’s Lincoln . \n“First of all, he’s not from this country. He had an accent that I could detect; I don’t know if other people could detect it. I don’t think Lincoln had an English accent, to the best of my knowledge,” Trump said of Day-Lewis. “I just don’t think that Lincoln behaved like that. He talked very, very slowly. I know lots of politicians and I know lots of successful people and they don’t talk like that. They talk with rapidity. Otherwise, they don’t get anything done.” \nIn 2014, Trump criticized the ceremony again via live-tweet, slamming host Ellen DeGeneres for “having a hard time with her lines.” Ellen is sadly having a hard time with her lines. #Oscars \n— Donald J.

Worst graphics and stage backdrop ever at the Oscars. Show is terrible, really BORING! \n— Donald J.
