Newcastle lead the Championship again after victory on Saturday (Photo: Newcastle United via Getty) \nBenitez, for his part, is not convinced the current squad — who top the division and are six points clear of third-placed Reading after Saturday's win over Derby — is good enough to guarantee a return to the big time, and was desperate to strengthen in the winter window. \nTownsend was only ever likely to return on a loan, following his £11million summer move from Newcastle to Crystal Palace. But the Geordies refused to meet the terms of a £2m loan fee, coupled with a further £13m payment in the summer. The deal to re-sign Townsend on loan was too rich for Mike Ashley's blood (Photo: Getty) \nAshley, one of the biggest spenders last time Newcastle won promotion from the Championship, has indicated he will dig deep again once they are back in the top flight. \nBut he is adamant it's going to be done his way – something that will give Benitez food for thought over the coming months. \nThe Spaniard has indicated he will not quit but has refused to give assurances about his long-term future beyond the end of the season, when Ashley’s plans are set to move into sharper focus. poll loading Will Newcastle win the Championship? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:55:24.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
