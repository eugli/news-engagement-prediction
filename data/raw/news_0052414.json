But this time, immigration lawyers are ready, or as ready as anyone can be during this \" unprecedented presidency .\" \n“There’s not much we can do until we see the text of the next executive order,” said Ayodele Gansallo, a senior staff attorney at HIAS Pennsylvania , which provides services to low-income immigrants. “But we will be ready to challenge it if it fails to observe the protections guaranteed by the Constitution. It will be interesting to see if this administration has learned anything from the previous debacle, especially that the president’s powers are not limitless. \nAbout that debacle. . . . \nI recently sat with Gansallo in a windowless office on Arch Street that she shares with some fish she pragmatically calls Fish. She got her aquatic office mates after she heard they might help decrease stress. But these days, finding Nemo \nOn the day last month that Trump’s ban restricted travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries and temporarily halted a refugee program for Syrian immigrants, Gansallo was at the auto shop waiting for an oil change. She planned a trip to the gym, followed by a bunch of Saturday chores and then her son’ \nIt was a friend, another lawyer who had just gotten a call from a Syrian family \n“I'm thinking about the conflict in Syria, [about this family] and thinking, ‘I hope they're OK, and I see women's swimsuits hanging up … and I don’t know, something felt wrong about that.... It just felt as if I was in the wrong place.” \nIn the international arrivals hall, where the Declaration of Independence is inscribed on the walls, a growing crowd of protesters rallied against Trump’s order. They held signs supporting the refugees and chanted, “Ban the wall!” and “Philly is your home! \n“We, in the immigration community, have not seen [an expression like that] for a very long time,” \nBack home that night, Gansallo tried to process the day. Her head was throbbing, but protesters' overwhelming defense for immigrants at airports across the country bolstered her for the prolonged fight ahead. \n“I definitely respect the office of the presidency,” Gansallo said. “But I see the effects of a policy like this. I see what happens to families who get separated. I see the results of demonizing refugees, and it seems to me that people forget the history from whence we came. There's been a history of welcoming the stranger, giving refuge to those who needed it. When America got that wrong, it got it wrong in a very serious way. \nIf nothing else, reflect on those words, spoken by a Nigerian immigrant turned U.S. citizen who now fights for others who are nervously racing against time to beat Trump's next ban: \nAgain, Gansallo was there. This time to witness the tears of joy from a mother who just last month had sobbed inconsolably when stopped just feet from reuniting with daughters she hadn’ \n“The successes sustain me, Gansallo said. \nOn the eve of another ban, she vows to hold on to that feeling as long as she can.
