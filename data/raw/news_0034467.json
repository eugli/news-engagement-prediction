They want to complicate everything by creating a new merry-go-round. Rather than thinking up a new analogy for the movement of several strikers between clubs, the tabloid has unimaginatively re-used an existing one to create a “striker merry go round” (no hyphens). So now we have two merry-go-rounds and it feels like something sacred has been sullied. The Mirror just couldn’t leave well alone. [PREMIER LEAGUE A SIX-TEAM RACE – CONTE] The result is a jumbled 1,200-word essay on the their website detailing where virtually every top striker in Europe might go if some other top strikers go somewhere else. No one needs to be reading that kind of thing on a Saturday morning, so Hot Football Transfer Gossip has taken one for the team and trawled through the magnum opus so you don’t have to. What we learned is that everything revolves around Karim Benzema. The French striker has allegedly been promised a contract extension by Real Madrid, which would allow Los Blancos to offload Alvaro Morata to Chelsea and make space in their squad for their top summer target Paulo Dybala of Juventus, who would attempt to replace the Argentine with Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez. This is bad news for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, “who has always been more interested in joining Real Madrid than they have in him”, meaning Borussia Dortmund’s Gabonese goal machine may have to settle for a move to Liverpool instead. There are some other bits about Sergio Aguero, Robert Lewandowski, Mauro Icardi and lots of other strikers too, but we haven’t got time for that, and nor have you. In what will probably one day become known as the right-back merry-go-round, Manchester City are considering a move for Tottenham’s Kyle Walker as a replacement for Bacary Sagna, who the Telegraph says is wanted by West Ham. The Hammers are in need of an ultra-dependable veteran right-back after Alvaro Arbeloa failed to do what it said on his tin. Liverpool are “leading the race” to sign Athletic Bilbao striker Inaki Williams and are willing to meet his £42m release clause, according to Calciomercato . More bad news for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang there. Elsewhere, Bayern Munich are set to beat Chelsea, Man City and Man Utd to the signing of Bayer Leverkusen’s 19-year-old midfielder Benjamin Henrichs ( Sportbild ), Watford manager Walter Mazzarri is keen to keep on-loan midfielder Tom Cleverly at Vicarage Road for years to come ( BT Sport ), and Antonio Valencia has revealed that Jose Mourinho tried to sign him from United while he was Real Madrid manager ( Mail ). Finally, in the good old-fashioned managerial merry-go-round, Arsene Wenger has “still not made up his mind” about whether to leave Arsenal in the summer ( Independent ) as alleged Gunners target Thomas Tuchel insists he is “happy” managing Dortmund (also Independent ). Admittedly, the striker merry-go-round was a bit more interesting than that.
