If you take that fear of failure away and when u give guys the opportunity to discover themselves as players, to develop as players quicker than what they would have while being paralysed in fear than ultimately in twenty-thirty years’ time they can sit and look back their experiences.” \nThe former New Zealand skipper said that he is having a fantastic time at Pakistan Super League as he is witnessing great competition in high-quality cricket matches. \nOn PSL, he opined that as what IPL did for India as by giving their young players an opportunity to develop their acumen by playing along with successful international cricketers; the same trend is being followed in the Pakistani league. He predicted that: “we will see the benefit of PSL in coming years when younger guys will develop at a quicker rate than probably they wouldn’t have without PSL.” \nHe said: “we have already seen the development and emergence of guy like Muhammad Irfan (Jr) in a short space of time and there are couple of other guys who are waiting so when they get their chance I am really confident that they will be able to stand up and deliver on a big stage just as Irfan has done.” \nCalling the player development programme of Lahore Qalandar as, ‘phenomenal’, he said that it is one of the success stories of the PSL in which around 120,000 people turned up for a trial of a franchise. \n“The owners must be applauded for their foresight to give those opportunities to appear on a big stage.” \nOn the question of, “Is it tough to captain a team with diverse cricketing backgrounds?” \nMcCullum said that in fact he finds it more exciting because it gives him an opportunity to be able to keep this sort of experiences where he gives players the freedom to push their skill set and to understand the perspectives of different walks of life, \n“Different upbringing, different ethnicities make the dressing room vast and all these guys come closer for one common cause.” \nHe thanked the people of Lahore for supporting the team and said that his thoughts are with the people who had gone through a very tough week. \nMcCullum pushes Qalandars to unleash their potential #PSL2017 Posted by Geo News English on Thursday, February 16, 2017 \n\nHere are some of Brendon McCullum's most notable stats from his illustrious career: NZ’s most successful ODI captain (Win/Loss 36-22) First NZ captain to take his team to a World Cup final, in 2015 Most T20I runs by any batsman (2140) Fastest 50 in World Cup history (18 balls) Fastest Test hundred (54 balls) NZ v Aus 2015/16 Most 6s in Tests (107) Second most 6s in T20Is (91) Only batsman to score two 100s in T20Is First New Zealander to score 300 in Tests More Stories From PSL", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:04:00.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
