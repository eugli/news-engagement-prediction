Top 5 Things to Know Today In Financial Markets \nInvesting.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, February 14: \n1. Markets await Yellen testimony \nFed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to testify on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee at 10:00AM ET (15:00GMT) Tuesday. Her comments will be monitored closely for any new insight on policy and the timing of when it might raise interest rates. \nFed fund futures are pricing in less than a 15% chance of a rate hike in March, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool , while odds of a June increase was seen at around 60%. \nThe U.S. central bank has previously projected three rate increases this year. However, traders remained unconvinced, with markets continuing to price in just two rate hikes during the course of this year. \n2. Dollar falters, pressured by Flynn resignation \nThe dollar declined on Tuesday as caution set in before testimony from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen and after President Donald Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned unexpectedly. \nThe dollar deepened losses against a basket of major currencies after news broke that Flynn was stepping down amid concerns over the White House national security adviser’s Russian contacts. \nThe dollar index was down around 0.2% at 100.82 in early New York morning hours, pulling back from Monday's high of 101.11, which was its strongest level since January 20. \nAgainst the yen, the greenback was down around 0.4% to 113.31 ( USD/JPY ), off Monday's high of 114.17. \n3. Global stocks pull back \nU.S. stock market futures pointed to a modestly lower open on Tuesday morning, one day after equity indexes hit record highs, as traders eyed earnings, data and Fed Chair Janet Yellen's testimony. \nMeanwhile, European stocks declined , heading for their first drop in six sessions, after economic growth data from Germany and the euro zone missed forecasts. \nEarlier, in Asia, markets ended mixed , with the Shanghai Composite in China closing up less than 0.1%, while Japan's Nikkei slumped 1.1%, pressured by heavy losses in Toshiba (T: 6502 ). \n4. Oil remains trapped in familiar range \nOil prices bounced back from the prior session's losses on Tuesday, but remained trapped in a familiar trading range as market players continued to weigh the prospect of production cuts by major crude-producing nations against a rise in U.S. drilling. \nU.S. crude was up 43 cents, or around 0.8%, to $53.36, while Brent tacked on 54 cents, or about 1%, to $56.13 a barrel. \nFutures have been trading in a narrow $5 range around the lower-to-mid-$50s since December as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers and expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production. \n5. U.K., China inflation rise to multi-year highs \nBritish consumer prices rose last month at the fastest pace since June 2014 , caused by higher global oil prices and the Brexit vote-fueled fall in the value of sterling, official data showed on Tuesday. \nConsumer prices rose 1.8% compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said, slightly below expectations for a 1.9% annual rise. \nElsewhere, China's consumer prices rose 2.5% in January on-year, its highest since May 2014. China's producer price index also grew at 6.9% , the quickest pace since August 2011. \nInflation will remain on the radar, with data from the U.S. coming on Wednesday .
