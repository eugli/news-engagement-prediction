Autosomal DNA contains almost the entire genome, or blueprint, for the human body; where we find the genes that determine our physical characteristics, from hair color to disease susceptibility. Because autosomal DNA is inherited by both men and women from both parents and all four grandparents, it can be used to test for relationships in all family lines. As a genealogy application, autosomal testing was originally introduced as a tool for determining biogeographical origins, or the percentage of various population groups (African, European, etc.) that exist in your DNA. Labs are now, however, offering extended family autosomal testing, which can help verify biological relationships through the grandparent generation, and potentially point to ancestral matches back as far as five or six generations, and sometimes beyond. \nWhich DNA Testing Company Should I Use? \nThe answer, as in many areas of genealogy, is \"it depends.\" Because different people test with different companies, many of which maintain their own databases of tested individuals, you will achieve the greatest chance of useful matches by either being tested, or sharing your DNA results, with as many companies as possible. The big three used by the vast majority of genealogists are AncestryDNA, Family Tree DNA, and 23andme. Geno 2.0, sold by National Geographic, is also popular, but it tests purely for ethnic heritage (deep ancestry) and is not useful for learning about possible ancestors during a reasonable genealogical timeframe. Some companies do allow you to enter results from outside DNA tests into their database, while others do not. Most allow you to download your raw data, and if the company does not offer this feature you may be better off looking elsewhere. If you can only afford to be tested by one company, then the International Society of Genetic Genealogists (ISOGG) has fairly up-to-date charts and information in their wiki for comparing the testing offered by different companies to help you choose the right company and test for your goals:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:30:19.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
