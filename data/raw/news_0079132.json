SFR Sport claims that Chelsea did indeed receive a typically massive offer from China but turned it down. \nThe report says that Tianjin Quanjian, managed by Ballon d'Or winner and former Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro, offered a whopping £90 million for Costa's services. \nAs is normal in the Chinese Super League, eye-watering wages of £85m a year were part of the deal that was rejected by Chelsea. \nHad the deal come to fruition, Costa would have joined former teammates John Obi Mikel and Oscar in the Chinese Super League, while the consensus is that he would have become the second most expensive player of all-time - just behind Manchester United's Paul Pogba. \nCosta was dropped by Chelsea for the trip to Leicester City last month but reconciled with boss Antonio Conte and has scored three goals since returning to the side. \nBack in January, The Sun reported that Tianjin Quanjian had offered £50 million for Costa but no move ever materialised. \nSpeaking of transfers that never happened, check out our \"Transfers that never were XI\": \nAt present, Costa earns around £150,000 a week and after his contributions this season, Chelsea are keen on offering him a new contract that will see him on terms of at least £200,000 a week and on a longer contract. \nThe new wages would also take him into the top five of the Premier League's top earners although he would still be someway short of Wayne Rooney's well earnt £300k-a-week. \nIf any Chinese Super League club are keen on signing him, they will have to wait until the summer as their transfer window for signing players ends tomorrow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:36:56.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
