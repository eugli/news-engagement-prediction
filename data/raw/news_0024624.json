Organisers are hoping for a similar turnout when the markets return this week. \nVendors say they are over prepared for the Night Noodle Markets opening tonight in Christchurch's North Hagley Park. \nHuge crowds overwhelmed last year's inaugural event. In total, about 91,000 people attended – more than double the expected turnout of 40,000. \nMany unprepared vendors ran out of food early in the evening and market-goers faced long queues. \nPot Sticker Dumpling Bar has 10,000 dumplings ready for hungry customers. \nREAD MORE: * Night Noodle Markets back and better \n﻿ \nPot Sticker Dumpling Bar owner Sam Hooper said his stall is ready for this year's event. \"We've already prepped 10,000 dumplings for tonight.\" \nThe dumpling bar ran out of food by 7.30pm on last year's opening night. \"We were told to have 500 portions prepared and as everyone knows that wasn't nearly enough.\" \nHooper has also brought in extra staff to reduce wait times. \nOver the five day event last year Pot Sticker Dumpling Bar served 65,000 dumplings, a figure he is aiming to beat. \nThe market's national events coordinator, Brett McMeekin said the markets have made a lot of improvements on last year's event. \nIt has introduced eftpos, payWave and there's a more efficient queuing system in place. \nThe free event runs through to February 12 and is open from 4pm to 10pm during the weekday and from 1pm on the weekend. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T10:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T10:09:52.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
