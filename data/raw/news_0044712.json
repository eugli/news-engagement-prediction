Of the first 100 killed, the army claims it was done within 24 hours of the terrorist attack. Khwaja Asif says that Hafiz Saeed is a threat to the country, which is laughable considering the red carpet he has been provided past decades, akin to other radical mullah-terrorists like Masood Azhar. But even if the American pressure mounts, whether the army will permit Hafiz Saeed to be sacrificed like Jalaluddin Haqqani appears impossible given his relevance to the ISI in perpetuating proxy war both in India and Afghanistan including directing Islamic State attacks in Afghanistan; Afghanistan has officially told Pakistan Hafiz Saeed, former LeT chief is directing ISIS operations in Afghanistan as reported by Voice of America . On the other hand, Hafiz Saeed’s disappearance may be even faked by Pakistan to appease the US. Indian Army chief General Bipin Rawat. PTI \nMasood Azhar naturally is being treated as national treasure with his outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) linked with the Taliban and the Islamic State. But if Hafiz Saeed has been directing Islamic State attacks in Afghanistan, why would the Pakistan army not use him to direct terror attacks in Sindh and Balochistan for reasons not very difficult to guess? But coming to the 135 ‘terrorists’ killed by the Pakistan army and the continuing drive that would increase the count, how many of them are actually terrorists is anybody’s guess. However, surely the idiom “zebra can’t change its stripes” is well known and remains relevant to the Pakistan army. Given the past record of Pakistani army and its policy since Zia-ul-Haq of ruthlessly promulgating hardcore radicalism, they would not only could have organised and abetted the above terror attack but would use the opportunity to target and kill those civilians/terrorists who are of no ‘use’ to the army and/or are opposed to Pakistan’s ‘deep state’? \nNaturally, there is not a murmur of dissent against above doings of the Pakistani army. The journos learned it the hard way by opening their mouth of the army’s genocide in Balochistan and the truth of the aerial and artillery bombardments in north Waziristan as part of Operation Zarb-e-Azb; they were simply wiped out or vanished. Even Nadia Rahman, Pakistani supporter of Amnesty International cautiously said, “The authorities have a responsibility to protect people’s lives but must do so while adhering to international law\", which too may have cost her dearly. But the most significant part is not a single squeak from the self-styled human rights activists in India; not one politician, not one journo, not one self-styled activist. Contrast this with the furore over a simple statement by General Bipin Rawat, Indian Army Chief that stone pelters hindering operations of security forces will be treated as anti-national and will be dealt with accordingly. Adverse comments by J&K politicians are natural because those speaking do not want the situation to normalise with the money they are raking in or are in league with the separatists and/or their cross-border benefactors. But then you have a bunch of others headed by the Congress brigade who are beating their chests on the statement by General Rawat. It is not surprising when during a TV debate in early 2014, the Congress spokesperson stated that “Nationalism is NOT Relevant to India”. So, you have politicians without any conscience who want to rule the country. \nFrom time to time, you find politicians stating that soldiers joining the army are meant to die anyway or that soldiers join army only for money. Obviously, the terms nam, nishan aur izzat are alien to this species. A weekly magazine cover shows photographs of an army officer with the caption ‘Officer And A Rogue’. Is the aim to deride the army and portray this is what army officers are? But then even politicians holding ministerial births have had a go at deriding the army. \nThe limit was crossed recently by Prashant Paricharak, MLA from Solapur (Maharashtra) who insulted our army soldiers by saying jawans are on borders for years yet how their wives give birth to babies. It is doubtful if the Supreme Court would take suo moto cognizance of such going ons but we definitely need a law to make such fellows do compulsory military service under the army in insurgency areas or on the border. Similar should be the treatment to those sympathising with stone-pelters obstructing army operations. India needs to be cleansed of these critters as part of ‘Swachh Bharat’. Coming winter is going to be much harsher in J&K with stone-pelters using Molotov cocktails instead of stones, as reported in British media. It is the next stage of ISI’s intifada in J&K. It should be made very clear that those who insult the army, insult the nation and those who speak for terrorist supporters or terrorists are clearly anti-national. #Afghanistan #Amnesty international #General bipin rawat #Hafiz saeed #Indian army #Inmyopinion #Islamic-state #Jaish-e-mohammed #Jalaluddin haqqani #Lal shahbaz qalandar shrine #Masood azhar #Nadia rahman #Operation zarb-e-azb Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:02:25.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
