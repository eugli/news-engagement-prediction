On the final day of the 1974-75 season, with Les Verts having wrapped up their second successive French title (and firmly on course for a second successive double), their manager, Robert Herbin, decided to add a flourish to their final home match of the season: he named himself in the starting line-up against Troyes. And when Saint Etienne, who had won every home match in the league that season, were awarded a penalty five minutes from time, do you think Herbin left it to be converted by the usual penalty-taker, Jean-Michel Larqué? Of course not, he seized the ball and leathered it into the net himself, putting a snazzy ribbon on a 5-1 victory. So how you gonna follow that, José? \nAdmittedly, Manchester United’s current position is not quite as cosy as Saint Etienne’s was back then but are they really likely to let slip the 3-0 first-leg lead given to them last week by Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s hat-trick? It’s not impossible, to be fair, as Saint Etienne did create plenty of chances at Old Trafford and, if they’ve any sense, have been working round the clock on their finishing since then. We must also bear in mind that in 1975 Herbin was 36 years old (he had retired from playing three years previously). Mourinho is 54. All things considered, for the Portuguese to pick himself in the starting line-up today would be to flirt with recklessness, even humiliation. We’ll have the team news for you shortly but chances are that Mourinho, still cautious at heart, will only be among the substitutes.
