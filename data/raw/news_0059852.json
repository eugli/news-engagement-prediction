Getty Images by Adeline Duff \nThe Greater Tokyo Area is an extremely vast metropolis—the most populous metropolitan area in the world, to be exact—jam-packed with people of diverse backgrounds. This makes it difficult to pinpoint a particular “Tokyo style\" when it comes to interior design. \nSome apartments are teeny-tiny and kept super minimalist. Many are colorful, quirky, and over-the-top. And then, there are homes that embrace traditional Japanese décor. \nThere may not be clear rules to follow on Tokyo style, but we suggest you go the quirky or traditional routes to have the most fun. \nIf you’re into bright colors and aren’t afraid to experiment, this decorating process is for you. Urban Japanese folk love to play with shape and incorporate neon accents and multiple patterns. \nFlora (most obviously, cherry blossoms , bamboo, and bonsai trees) is a notable element in any Japanese household—which brings us to the more traditional approach. \nMany people living in Tokyo prefer the classic, minimal Japanese look. Typically, this includes items like chabudais (short-legged tables) , zabutons (floor cushions), shoji screens , tatami mats, iron cast lanterns, and tansu chests. Bamboo wood panels may surround the iconic tatami beds, and walls are often adorned with large-scale ink paintings or scrolls. \nTo help get you started, we gathered a collection of products that work in both styles of homes. Below, you’ll see whimsical, colorful decorative accents juxtaposed with antique wooden treasures . Oh, and high-tech toilets are in almost every home (and hotel ) in Japan, so investing in one of those is a must—regardless of which approach you choose to take. \nHappy shopping!
