He's already lawyered up, but says he'll wait to see how the criminal case plays out before considering a lawsuit. \nAs we reported, Epps was arrested for battery and no-showed for his arraignment . His reps had no comment, but on Tuesday he signed autographs and repeated, \"I love my fans\" like it's his mantra. Too little too late?
