(Launch Good) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  41 PM \nAfter dozens of tombstones at a historic Jewish St. Louis cemetery were vandalized over the weekend, Muslim-American activists started a fundraiser to help pay for repairs. \n“Every person deserves to rest in peace,” activist and campaign organizer, Tarek El-Messidi, told the Daily News Tuesday. “No one wants to see the grave of their loved ones desecrated.” \nWhen El-Messidi first learned vandals damaged more than 100 headstones at the Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in University City, he immediately reached its director to talk about campaign ideas and the best ways to provide financial assistance. \nThere have been no arrests.

When his disciples asked why, he said: “Is it not a human soul?” \nThe campaign organized by Linda Sarsour, of MPower Change, and El-Messidi, of Celebrate Mercy, raised more than $30,000 within hours of launching Tuesday. \n“Through this campaign, we hope to send a united message from the Jewish and Muslim communities that there is no place for this type of hate, desecration, and violence in America,” the fundraising page on LauchingGood reads.

That may be the light in this darkness that we see.” Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:51:05.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
