David Paul Morris/Bloomberg As Framingham-based TJX Companies Inc. celebrates four decades in business, the discount retail behemoth is making plans for significant future growth with the launch of a second home-goods concept. TJX (NYSE: TJX), the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and Sierra Trading Post, grew its store base by 198 to 3,800 total stores last year. It plans to open at least another 200 stores this year — including four stores under the new home concept. TJX Cos.’ HomeGoods chain saw $4.41 billion in sales last year. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg The plans were announced as part of a fourth-quarter earnings conference call Wednesday morning. TJX reported $33.18 billion in sales in 2016 — a figure that gave CEO Ernie Hermann “great confidence as we continue to grow TJX as the only major international off-price retailer in the world.” Hermann said there’s potential to grow to 5,600 stores — an almost 50 percent increase — in the long term. In the U.S. and Canada, Hermann said there’s a potential to open an additional 1,300 stores. “We continue to see a favorable real estate environment and are taking advantage of many opportunities around the world,” Hermann said on the call, according to a transcript from investing website SeekingAlpha . “We see enormous white space for our U.S. home business.” The new home concept would be operated as a complement to TJX’s HomeGoods chain, which has 568 stores in 45 states. The retail chain, which saw $4.41 billion in sales in fiscal 2017, sells furniture, lamps, rugs and home decor. Hermann did not specify a name for the new home concept, nor where the four new stores would be located. TJX will attempt to differentiate the concept from HomeGoods but encourage customers to shop at both stores, much as it has done with T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. Hermann said TJX has been testing the new home concept for the past 18 months. “You guys wouldn’t realize it by the way we’ve been testing it, but that’s allowing us to plant the seeds and feel a high degree of confidence on what the store can do for business when it starts up later on this year,” Hermann said on the call. “While we are proud to have grown HomeGoods’ customer base for many years, we believe we remain significantly underpenetrated in the total U.S. home market and enormous opportunity remains for us to gain share in this space.” For the fourth quarter ending Jan. 28, TJX reported net income of $677.9 million, up 1.7 percent from $666.5 million the year prior, and sales of $9.48 billion, up 5.6 percent from $8.96 billion in the year-ago period. TJX made headlines earlier this month when leadership instructed T.J. Maxx and Marshalls employees to get rid of any signs related to Ivanka Trump-related merchandise. The conference call made no mention of that event. Catherine Carlock covers Greater Boston's commercial real estate industry.
