He was detained in Afghanistan by U.S. special forces and taken to Guantanamo in 2002.\nBritani was freed in 2004 after the government of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair lobbied for his release and later traveled to Syria to fight with Islamic State.\nA spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday the government was not able to verify his identity. \"There is no independent confirmation of the identity of this man who is believed to be dead in Mosul,\" he told reporters.\nAsked whether he believed Britani had moved on from Syria he said: \"I am not going to comment on intelligence matters\". He also said the conflict in Syria meant it was impossible to verify events there.\nBritain reached a civil damages settlement with British former Guantanamo Bay inmates in 2010, then-Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke told parliament at the time, but he did not disclose the size of the payouts, citing confidentiality agreements.\nThe Daily Mail reported that Britani had been awarded $1.25 million by the British government after claiming British agents knew or were complicit in his alleged mistreatment. May's spokesman declined to comment on the details of any payments or whether the government had been monitoring Britani.\nBritani's family, in a statement to the BBC, said their son had not received a million pounds in compensation and that they believed that figure was a group settlement, including costs, covering other inmates too.\nIn a statement posted by his office on Twitter, Blair said the Mail newspaper had led a campaign pushing for Guantanamo detainees' release, and it had been supported by lawmakers from May's Conservatives.\n\"The fact is that this was always a very difficult situation where any government would have to balance proper concern for civil liberties with desire to protect our security, and we were likely to be attacked whatever course we took,\" he said.\n(Additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan in London; Editing by Stephen Addison and Dominic Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:34:37.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
