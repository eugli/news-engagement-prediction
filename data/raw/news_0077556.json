Share via Twitter Composite. Getty Images The cast of Dancing With the Stars season 24 is coming together. On Friday, we learned that gymnastics dynamo and Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles has signed on to show off a new kind of routine on the competition, and now, People reports that The Bachelor 's Nick Viall will try his hand at winning the coveted Mirrorball Trophy—after he wins the heart of one of his remaining hopefuls on that other ABC series he's currently starring on. Viall certainly isn't the first Bachelor contestant to appear on Dancing With the Stars, but he might be the most familiar with reality TV. He has appeared on two separate seasons of The Bachelorette (Andi Dorfman's and Kaitlyn Bristowe's, to be specific) in addition to his own season of The Bachelor . And he was a cast member on the most recent season of Bachelor in Paradise. Fellow Bachelor Nation alums Sean Lowe, Jake Pavelka, Melissa Rycroft, and Trista Sutter have put their dance moves on display on DWTS , though none has managed to take home the win. And Viall isn't the only addition to season 24 cast. Former Glee star Heather Morris has also reportedly signed on. Morris comes into the competition with a leg up, though. Aside from being the resident dance expert on the Fox series, she was previously a backup dancer on Beyoncé's The Beyoncé Experience Tour, and she was a contestant on season two of So You Think You Can Dance. According to People , The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills ' Erika Girardi, actress-comedian Charo, and professional bull rider and model Bonner Bolton are all set to join the cast. Variety also reports that former figure skater Nancy Kerrigan and an unnamed member of Fifth Harmony will hit the dance floor when season 24 premieres. ABC hasn't commented on the casting scoop, but all is set to be officially revealed on Wednesday's Good Morning America.
