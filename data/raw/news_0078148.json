Mathur, Assistant Inspector-General of Forest, National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), on February 27 has also advised the wildlife wing of the Ministry to “disallow filming permission to BBC in any protected areas of the country for a period of five years”. A reaction from the international broadcaster is awaited. \nThe move comes in the wake of Mr. Rowllat’s documentary titled “One World: Killing for Conservation” which explores the anti-poaching strategy adopted by the guards at Kaziranga Tiger Reserve in Assam. The film claims that forest guards at the tiger reserve have been given powers to shoot and kill those indulging in poaching of Rhinoceros at the World Heritage Site. \nThe NTCA in its memorandum — a copy of which is with The Hindu — has alleged that the violations by the journalist involve “filming after sunset”, dishonouring the undertaking provided along with “deviating from original synopsis submitted to MEA and its authority”. \n“The said person and his agency have committed a complete breach of trust by submitting a false synopsis, with an aim of misleading Government of India Officials into giving filming permission and producing the documentary which shows India's conservation efforts in poor light, contrary to the synopsis submitted” the office memorandum states. \nEarlier, on February 13, NTCA had stated that “producer Mr. Justin Rowlatt be black listed and the BBC be given a warning to adhere to clauses provided in the clearances/approvals of the Government of India”. \nThe earlier memorandum has described the documentary as “grossly erroneous reporting”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T13:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:22:33.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
