Clark, reports The Washington Post.   \nKindred Nursing Centers v. Clark centers on a Kentucky Supreme Court decision regarding the Federal Arbitration Act, and the justices debated whether it \"pre-empts a state-law contract rule that singles out arbitration by requiring a power of attorney to expressly refer to arbitration agreements before the attorney-in-fact can bind her principal to an arbitration agreement,\" notes SCOTUSblog. \nA court spokesperson said that that Trump and her daughter were guests of Justice Anthony Kennedy, whom the fashion mogul and businesswoman met at her father's inauguration in January. Supreme Court justices regularly invite guests to sit in for arguments, although presidential children rarely attend, according to NBC News.   \nThe pair sat through the whole argument session. Arabella was seen peering over the rows of seats in front of her. \nThey left the courthouse just before noon and posed briefly for photos before their departure. \n\"Arabella and I visited the Supreme Court this morning and attended a hearing,\" Trump wrote on her Facebook page on Feb. 22, captioning the photo of her standing outside the courthouse with her daughter. \"I'm grateful for the opportunity to teach her about the judicial system in our country firsthand. #SCOTUS #SupremeCourt #ImportantLessons #MotherDaughter.\" \nThe first daughter and her family moved to Washington, D.C., shortly before President Donald Trump's inauguration, in support of her husband, Jared Kushner, in his role as senior adviser to the president. She has stepped down from all formal roles managing her and her father's businesses and is taking time to \"settle\" her three children \"into their new home and schools,\" she said in a January Facebook post.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:54:24.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
