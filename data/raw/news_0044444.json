In the beginning, they examined the absurdity of racial stereotypes through the use of crude, occasionally inscrutable slogans like “Black People Are Cropped” or “White People Are Angles on Fire.” This painting, “ Sunny Day White Power ,” an entry in that series, was started during the administration of George H. W. Bush, and returned to shortly before the time Trump announced his candidacy. “I was excited about Obama, but at the same time I was wondering how the machine of conventional politics would nullify his impact. You could say I was suspicious. I’m the kind of person who sees clouds on the horizon. Or smoke. There’s always this sense that there’s more to do. And we became complacent. Otherwise I don’t think what happened on Nov. 8 would have happened. It’s almost as if we thought black people — or President Obama — could solve everything. It’s about some fantasy we had — this Caramel Camelot. And so now we are where we are. “When George W. Bush was re-elected, that really threw people. It galvanized them. In some ways we’re in the same place with Trump. His election might not be the worst thing in the world in that it will cause people to stop being so lazy, myself included. It’s a choice to be energized, because the other choice is a depressing, pointless way of looking at it. I choose to think we can actually do something with this material called failure.” The Chicago-based artist Pope.L began making his series of paintings called “Skin Set” two decades ago.

She received more than 3,500 responses in 10 languages, equally split between men and women. The answers became the series “WOMEN Words, Phrases and Stories,” which will eventually include 1,000 individual word paintings. “ Heck, People Just Don’t Like Women ” is a recent addition. “In 2002, three of the most common replies were ‘mother,’ ‘bitch’ and ‘slut.’ In 2013, I sent out the message again, and this time I said the answers would be anonymous. I was curious if that made a difference. It did. People didn’t just send me a list of words, they told whole stories, which were fascinating and sort of awful to read. And those three words that were repeated in 2002 were repeated again. I thought that was amazing. Basically, this is the way the world thinks about women. The difference now is that we’ve become more sensitive to the words and how they play out in real life. We’ve never seen such an example of plain-old misogyny — as well as embedded misogyny from women — as we did in 2016. You can’t escape the political implication of this piece.” Image Credit Photograph by Wyatt Gallery, courtesy of For Freedoms For Freedoms For Freedoms, a New York-based super PAC founded by the artists Hank Willis Thomas and Eric Gottesman, commissioned artists to create political ads in the run-up to the 2016 election. “ Make America Great Again ” was installed a few weeks before Election Day in Pearl, Miss. Willis Thomas: “The billboard in Pearl featured a famous image by James ‘Spider’ Martin of unarmed protesters — including John Lewis, now a United States congressman — facing off against the Alabama state troopers on March 7, 1965, a day that became known as Bloody Sunday. The activists in the civil rights era stood up against injustice, even when that meant standing up against the government; they made America great. The intention was to empathize with those men and women, but many people were confused about the sign and who put it there. At first, they thought we might be a right-wing group. A local liberal activist called after the election and said, ‘You might think that you’re doing something that’s good and interesting, but for people on the ground here, you’re putting lives at risk. With the uptick in hate crimes since the election, you might be inciting and empowering white supremacists, saying it’s O.K. to go beat up on black people.’ That threw me off — that people thought we were empathizing with the state troopers!” Gottesman: “An iconic civil rights image went from the protesters being seen as heroic wards of American values to now people associating with the police. Ambiguity is really dangerous, because it promotes the idea of having a conversation where you don’t know all the answers. Artists do this all the time, right? But many people feel uncomfortable if they aren’t told how to feel about something, or if they don’t know what the message is.” Image “Repellent Fence/Valla Repelente,” 2015, Land art installation and community engagement (earth, cinder block, para-cord, PVC spheres, helium).

Credit Photograph by Michael Lundgren, courtesy of Bockley Gallery Postcommodity The Arizona- and New Mexico-based collective Postcommodity consists of Raven Chacon, Cristóbal Martínez and Kade L. Twist. The group spent three years working with the local governments in Douglas, Ariz., and Agua Prieta, Mexico, to create an installation, “ Repellent Fence/ Valla Repelente ,” completed in 2015, of so- called scare-eye balloons — emblazoned with indigenous iconography — that crossed the U.S./Mexico border. A video that expands upon the project will be in the 2017 Whitney Biennial. Martínez: “Most politicians making decisions about the border have never been there — they don’t know what it looks like or what they’re creating. They don’t know who the people are. We felt like there was an indigenous perspective missing from the immigration debate, and a lot of the reason for this is that many of those immigrants are indigenous people of color. We see ourselves in them, in other words. Our work is not about nations in the sense of what federal governments are up to. It’s more about local community and indigenous self-determination. If the human spirit is there, and there are needs and desires in a community, if it can organize, it always has the opportunity to transcend federal policies. There’s always a way.” Image “untitled (the tyranny of common sense has reached its final stage, new york times, november 9, 2016),” 2016, acrylic and newspaper on linen, 89 1/4” x 73 1/4”. Credit Courtesy the artist and Gavin Brown’s enterprise, copyright the artist Rirkrit Tiravanija Some of the most famous works of the Thai artist Rirkrit Tiravanija eschew traditional art objects in favor of social interventions, including cooking large meals in galleries and at events like Frieze Art Fair. This painting, “ untitled (the tyranny of common sense has reached its final stage, new york times, november 9, 2016 ),” was made directly following the election, and debuted at Art Basel Miami Beach last December. “I’ve been using newspapers for a long time now, and I draw from long lists of quotes floating in my head. It is an ongoing project at this point. In newspapers, I see the contradictions of reality and fiction play out. ‘The tyranny of common sense has reached its final stage’ is a quote from Aldo van Eyck, perhaps taken out of context, but in the wake of the recent election, the quote resonates.” Image “Don’t Touch Me,” 2016, cardboard and color changing LED lights, 52” H x 67” W (132.08cm H x 170.18cm W).

She has been an activist for 15 years — helping Teamsters unionize Frieze art fair, for example, and attending various actions across the country, including the Standing Rock Reservation protests in North Dakota. This work was made following the election, and debuted at Art Basel Miami Beach last December. “I’ve always been in love with cardboard protest signs — I think they are beautiful sites of creativity. I was so blown away by the signs of the Occupy Movement, and almost envious of that as an art form. So I thought how can I use those materials, but make it into something that I do. I’m a feminist. I feel outraged that Donald Trump was elected after what he said publicly about women and decided to make that sign as a feminist gesture. I thought it was funny, too, in terms of an artwork that says ‘ Don’t Touch Me .’ I love the poetics of activist slogans. “The election made me more committed than ever to protest art, to figuring out how to step up my game. Maybe I need to be more aggressive and talk directly about the issues. Maybe I don’t need to be so delicate or subtle in the way I talk about my work.” Interactive T Magazine Newsletter Sign up for a weekly compendium of exquisite and exclusive fashion, design, food, interiors and travel coverage.
