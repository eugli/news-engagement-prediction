But first, the Wildcats must win at lowly Missouri on Tuesday night. \nKentucky is 22-5, 12-2 in the SEC. Missouri is 7-19, 2-12. But UK coach John Calipari is the spinning the Tigers’ cup as being half full. \n“I always want to look and watch what coaches are doing if their team is struggling a little bit,” Calipari said. “Do you keep them together? Do they keep growing? Do they keep trying? Do they stay positive? That’s what he’s doing. What I’m seeing is Missouri is playing their best basketball of the season. \n“I know what their record is so I expected to see something different when I started watching tape,” Calipari said. “But I fully expect that they’re going to come and play. You know what they do, they shoot the ball better than you give them credit for. They’re dangerous because they can make perimeter shots.” \nFor his part, Missouri coach Kim Anderson countered that, “We have to play a near-perfect game,” to beat Kentucky. \nMissouri opened with nine straight SEC losses, but is 2-3 over the last few weeks. Most notable, both conference wins came in Columbia – an 83-78 win over Arkansas and a shocking 72-52 rout of Vanderbilt. \n“I imagine we’re going to walk into an arena that’s going to have a ton of people in it, and a blackout or whatever they’re doing,” Calipari said. “It’s another game for us to figure out who we are.” \nIn Missouri’s two league wins, the Tigers shot 51 percent against Arkansas and 41 percent against Vanderbilt. The season average is 39.7. \nOne big key was free-throwing shooting. In the two wins, the Tigers were 40-for-51, 78.4 percent. Take away those games and Missouri is shooting 66.9 percent. \nJunior forward Jordan Barnett averaged 20.0 points in both wins, he scores 12.5 on the season. Sophomore forward Kevin Puryear averaged 14 points and eight rebounds, both a notch above his season averages. \nKentucky, meantime, is trying to steer its own ship back on course. After losing three of four games, the Wildcats have now won four in a row but only one by a comfortable margin. On Saturday, UK needed to make 17 straight free throws to hold off Georgia, 82-77. \n“You better be ready to play harder than they play, and you better be ready to take things personal, because they are,” Calipari said. “We gotta worry about us. Let’s be at our best, let’s understand what we’re trying to do. We’re still trying different things. The reboot moves on.” \nKentucky is led by freshman guard Malik Monk at 21.4 points per game. Next comes freshman guard De'Aaron Fox , 15.6; sophomore guard Isaiah Briscoe , 13.6; and freshman forward Bam Adebayo , 12.7. \n“We’re consistently trying to figure things out,” Calipari said. “We’re watching tape this morning with the team and showed them some things that were good and some of the stuff that wasn’t good, and where we have to improve. We’re using every day to get better. \n“There are times I think we’ve figured it out, and then there are other times I look and I’m like, ‘We haven’t,’” Calipari said. “But we’re one of those teams with an enormous upside, even now.” Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:12:20.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
