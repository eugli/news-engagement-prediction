Raised for 6-Year-Old With Inoperable Brain Tumor \nLittle Devin's campaign raised $93,000 in the first 24 hours, making it one of the fastest-growing campaigns on GoFundMe. By Melissa Willets Comments \nDevin Needs Your Help/ GoFundMe The parents whose 6-year-old son was recently diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor are hopefully taking some comfort in the generosity of others. \nA GoFundMe campaign set up to help care for a young boy named Devin by his aunt has far surpassed its goal of raising $50,000. In fact, at time of writing, donations have soared to more than $140,000. In just one day, the campaign raised $93,000, making it one of the fastest-growing campaigns outside of a national event, according to GoFundMe. \nPerhaps it is Devin's heartbreaking story that has spurred so many people to action. Described as a little boy who is full of personality and spunk, likes to \"dance and make funny faces,\" and \"wants to be noticed,\" Devin is one of four boys in a loving family of six. \nHis parents, James and Christine, have been \"deeply shattered\" by the news that Devin has Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), the life expectancy of which is between just eight months and two years. It must be impossible to understand why their little boy is fighting for his life against a \"very rare and aggressive form of cancer\" that, according to the GoFundMe page, affects only about 200 to 300 kids in the U.S. each year. \nDevin Needs Your Help/ GoFundMe \nAs Devin's aunt, Amy Suau Biggin, heartbreakingly details on the page, \"This type of tumor is located at the base of the brain and the top of the spine. Over time, it will impact all of little Devin's essential bodily functions: heartbeat, breathing, swallowing, eyesight and balance.\" \nFor now, she adds, \"Doctors at Boston Children's Hospital have informed us that radiation treatments are the best we can do to keep Devin comfortable for his remaining time.\" They are also desperately looking for breakthrough treatments that can help.

And it seems the momentum his story is gaining won't be halting any time soon. \nMelissa Willets is a writer/blogger and a mom.
