At India’s largest engineering and construction conglomerate, Larsen & Toubro , a smooth handover has been in the works for the last two years. Group chairman AM Naik isn’t waiting till October, when he retires, to anoint his successor SN Subrahmanyan as CEO. In July, Subrahmanyan takes over as CEO.Naik told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview that the roadmap was put in place two years ago, when SNS (as he is known within the company), was identified as Naik’s successor.Rather than throw him in at the deep end in October, Naik has been systematically handing businesses over to his successor. Eighteen months ago, Subrahmanyan was brought on the board of L&T Infotech and the L&T Technology Services, both of which were overseen by Naik until recently.“I sent him for four months to United States for orientation and one month to Europe and during this time, I took care of what he was supposed to be doing on a day-to-day basis, although he is so hard-working and committed that even from US, he kept track of what is going on here,” said Naik.Another very difficult project that SNS was handed over was the Hyderabad Metro, and he has been chairman of that company for more than 7-8 months.Naik’s plan is that before October 1 2017, SNS should be already running L&T. Naik says that in the next nine months, many more businesses will be handed over to SNS in a systematic way. Adds Naik, “I hope by October 1 he would have been running the company as such obviously he will become stronger by the day as he gets more and more experience.”On his part, Subrahmanyan already knows 50-60 percent of the company and for parts that he is still new to, he will have the support of his colleagues and his mentor AM Naik. He told Moneycontrol: “There are many aspects of it which I don’t understand which probably I never will because I don’t have the history; I don’t have the legacy; I don’t have the background, nor do I have the in-depth job knowledge because I don’t belong to that particular area. I am very conscious about it. So, I think it is inevitable and it is a must and it is my solemn duty that crucial aspects, important aspects, people aspects and maybe aspects where I have my own doubts and because you are lonely at the top. It is always good to have somebody whom you can always go and bounce your ideas upon and he is a gentleman who would welcome it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:09:27.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
