I think this is an important outreach.\" Phoenix church turns to paint to express hope for peace \nUzma Jafri, speaker for Islamic Speakers Bureau of Arizona, was among the scheduled speakers at the event. Jafri said her organization goes around the state to educate people on Islam. She said she was not surprised by the turnout. \n\"It just makes sense because this is America,\" Jafri said. \"We are founded in the democratic principle of freedom of religion ... Our forefathers came here for that very same reason, to escape religious persecution and to have religious freedom. It just makes sense that there should be a plethora and multitude of people of different religions and different backgrounds in the same room.\" \nPhoenix City Councilwoman Thelda Williams attended. She said District 1 has the most refugees of any of the city's districts and believes there are many misconceptions about those of Muslim faith. \n\"What I experience is people who want to be good neighbors,\" Williams said. \"I am very proud of the people who live here. I don't care what the media says, it's not true in this Valley.\" \nMarina Dust, 24, is a member of the mosque. She said she was happy to see so many different people attend the open house. \n\"With the recent rocky climate, I feel it's even more important today to reach out and educate as many people as you can and just be active in promoting peace, love and acceptance,\" she said. \nJoe Gosha, of Sun City, said he is part of an interfaith group that works with with at-risk youth in Phoenix. He also said he works with Syrian refugees and wanted to attend the open house to learn more about the people he works with. \nHe said he wanted \"to let the Muslim community know that there are native born people who are more than willing to enter into rational and open dialogue with newcomers to the country.\" Joe Gosha said he is at UICA's open house because he wants to show the Muslim community there are native born people open to talk@azcentral pic.twitter.com/vlbTHu5UdK â€” Ryan Santistevan (@SantistevanRyan) February 18, 2017 2 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2lves5y TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T10:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:22:27.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
