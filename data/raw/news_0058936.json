The previous figures also showed the inflow of EU citizens had hit a historic high of 284,000. The latest details, which cover individuals coming to the country for more than 12 months, show that immigration was estimated to be 596,000 in the year to September, down 23,000 from the period to September 2015. Some 268,000 of those were EU citizens, 257,000 came from outside the bloc, and 71,000 were Britons. Emigration from the UK was up 26,000 to 323,000, including 103,000 EU citizens, 93,000 non-EU and 128,000 British citizens. The number of Romanian and Bulgarian nationals was up 19,000 to 74,000 â€“ the highest on record. Some 268,000 of long-term immigrants were EU citizens, 257,000 came from outside the bloc, and 71,000 were Britons Some 180,000 EU citizens arrived for work-related reasons, with approximately 63 per cent of those having a definite job to go to. Overall the net flow from the union was 165,000 - the lowest for two years. Nicola White, ONS Head of International Migration Statistics, said: 'Although net migration in the year to September 2016 has not seen a statistically significant change, we have seen a statistically significant decrease in net migration among EU8 citizens and non-EU citizens from Africa, the Americas and Oceania. RECORD NUMBER OF ROMANIANS AND BULGARIANS ARRIVE The number of Bulgarians and Romanians migrating to the UK hit a record of 74,000 in the year to September. The \"statistically significant\" increase was partially offset by a fall in the number of nationals from eight other Eastern European states coming to the country. The EU8 countries - the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - joined the bloc in 2004. The outflow of nationals from these states was up by 12,000 year on year to 39,000 - the highest level for five years. 'This is the first release to contain long-term international migration estimates including three months of data following the EU referendum. 'Although we have seen a fall in net migration of EU8 citizens there have been continued increases in immigration from Romania and Bulgaria, so it is too early to say what effect the referendum result has had on long-term international migration. 'There has been a statistically significant decrease in non-EU long-term students immigrating to the UK while a small increase was seen in the number of study visas issued. 'It is too early to tell if this is an indication of a long-term trend.' Alp Mehmet, Vice-Chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the fall in net migration was a 'step in the right direction'. 'There is still a net inflow from Eastern Europe, especially from Romania and Bulgaria,' he said. 'These workers are generally in low-paid employment so this is where our proposal for work permits confined to those coming for skilled work would have a very useful effect on EU migration.' Immigration has been at the heart of fierce debate in both the run-up to and aftermath of the historic referendum in June. Theresa May has pledged that she will introduce controls on free movement rules following the Brexit vote. However, the shape of the new system will be the subject of tough negotiations with the EU.
