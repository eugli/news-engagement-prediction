The three inmates were serving various jail terms at the Medium Security Prison in Ogwashi-Uku, Aniocha South Local Government Area of Delta State. \nThe inmates, Messrs Dominic Igwe, 53, Idu Endurance, 23, and John Odalonu, 17, were respectively jailed for tricycle theft, breaking and entry and phone theft in different parts of the state. But they could not upset a fine option of N30, 000 each to stay away from jail. \nDominic Igwe, who is a father of three from Ebonyi State, said he was ingloriously hauled into prison by his former boss, following the mysterious disappearance of his tricycle, popularly called Keke, from the stadium complex, along the popular Nnebisi road in Asaba, the Delta State capital. \nAccording to Igwe, who spoke amidst tears, the tricycle was handed over to him on the understanding that he would pay N860, 000 through an installmental arrangement, but he had barely raked in N115, 000 for his estranged boss when the misfortune set in. \nEndurance, who was not ashamed to confess to breaking into a supermarket at Ejeme-Aniogor, a rural community in Aniocha south local government area of the state, said a group of local vigilantes apprehended him on his return from what could have been a successful mission. \nCaught on January 4, 2017, he narrated that he was detained at the B Division Police Station, from where he was arraigned before a Magistrate Court at Okwe, a community that shares boundary with Asaba. He lamented that from the day he was sentenced to a one year jail term with an option of N30,000 fine, not even one person had walked into the prison to visit him, noting, “the experience has shown me a lesson that whatever crime I commit, I am on my own.” \nSeventeen-year-old John Odalonu, who stole a Tecno T407 handset at a barbing saloon on January 17, an act that landed him in prison along with others, thanked Mr. Success for rescuing them and promised that they would never go back to crime.
