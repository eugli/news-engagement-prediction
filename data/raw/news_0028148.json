And in the long run, I think we lose business. We just wanted to stay true to our fans and our players and not book out the restaurant for one night.”\nSuch is life when you’re neighbors with the only pro sports team in town.\nYet not only is the steakhouse just down the street from the Thunder’s basketball home and a place where Durant himself used to routinely visit when he played here, it’s a favorite spot of current Thunder players after home games. There’s an all-glass private room in the front that is always unofficially reserved for Thunder star Russell Westbrook and his people on game nights, and another room for Thunder guard Victor Oladipo crowd and his friends or family.\nEven if they’re no-shows.\n“They just know that’s open for them,” Osborn said. “They don’t have to call us or anything. They can just come in. There’s nights they come in, and nights they (don’t).”\nThis steakhouse story first came to light on Friday night, when ESPN’s Steve Levy shared it via Twitter . Yet minutes later, Durant’s business manager, Rich Kleiman, retweeted Levy and deemed the story \"False.\"\nStill, Osborn claims it to be true.\n“They said they’d spend anywhere from $30,000 to $35,000, when they come and book out the restaurant, is what was told to me,” he said. “At the end of the day, it wasn’t (personal), just taking care of our people. I can’t shut down for that, and then we’ll have 100 or something people in here after the game, and to turn them away I don’t want to do that.”\nFollow Sam Amick on Twitter @sam_amick .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/espnSteveLevy/status/830266920184209408", "http://twitter.com/sam_amick", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "https://twitter.com/richkleiman/status/830288904708292608"], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T11:16:05.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
