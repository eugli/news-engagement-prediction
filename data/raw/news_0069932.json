Credit Mark Veltman for The New York Times The Melbourne -born actor Chris Hemsworth, 33, will tell you that there is no better place in the world than his native Australia , and he wants everyone else to know this, too: Mr. Hemsworth, who is most famous for playing the Marvel Comics superhero Thor in the 2011 eponymous movie and who is reprising the role in this fall’s “Thor: Ragnarok,” is on a mission to promote his homeland through his role as global ambassador for Tourism Australia, the country’s official tourism organization. Mr. Hemsworth is so attached to Australia that he moved back there three years ago from Los Angeles with his wife, the actress Elsa Pataky, and their three children, a daughter, India, 4, and twin boys, Sasha and Tristan, 2. Mr. Hemsworth was in New York City recently for a Tourism Australia event. Below are edited excerpts from a conversation with him. Q. Why did you decide to move back to Australia? A. I lived in L.A. for seven or eight years, but once I had kids, it got more difficult to get around with the paparazzi being there, and I wanted a more laid-back life for my family. Although I grew up mostly in Melbourne, we live in Byron Bay, a quiet town on the country’s east coast, which is one of my favorite spots on the planet. The beach is beautiful, and we wake up every day to views of the ocean in front of us, but there’s also a big farming community with lots of farmland and tropical rain forest. My wife and I went on a holiday there and fell in love with the area and chose to make it our home. Now, we have a chilled-out existence. Has Melbourne changed since you lived there as a child? I distinctly remember the city’s strong multicultural scene that I experienced as a kid, and that has only grown today. There’s such a diverse mixture of communities including Greek, Lebanese and Vietnamese, which means that the ethnic food is fantastic. The arts there are also rich. Are there any specific spots in Melbourne that visitors should hit? Definitely Flinders Lane, a street with lots of bars and restaurants that are great to hang out in. Bar hopping there is fun. And a meal at Matcha Mylkbar is a must. The restaurant serves only plant-based food and has one of the most inventive menus I have ever seen. I am not a vegan, but if I were, this is where I would go to eat. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
