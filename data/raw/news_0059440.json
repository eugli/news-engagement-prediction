Under baseball's labour contract, management can alter playing rules only with agreement from the union — unless it gives one year notice. With the one year of notice, management can make changes on its own.\nManfred said he will send a letter to the union in the coming days and plans to continue dialogue with Clark and others in hopes of reaching agreement.\n\"Unfortunately it now appears that there really won't be any meaningful change for the 2017 season due to a lack of co-operation from the MLBPA,\" Manfred said during a news conference. \"I've tried to be clear that our game is fundamentally sound, that it does not need to be fixed as some people have suggested, and I think last season was the kind of demonstration of the potential of our league to captivate the nation and of the game's unique place in American culture.\"\nYet, he also added: \"I believe it's a mistake to stick our head in the sand and ignore the fact that our game has changed and continues to change.\"\n'Willing to walk away' Manfred said while he prefers an agreement, \"I'm also not willing to walk away.\"\n\"I have great respect for the labour relations process, and I have a pretty good track record for getting things done with the MLBPA,\" he said. \"I have to admit, however, that I am disappointed that we could not even get the MLBPA to agree to modest rule changes like limits on trips to the mound that have little effect on the competitive character of the game.\"\nManfred said he didn't want to share specifics of certain rules changes he is \"wedded to\" as being his top priorities.\n\"There's a variety of changes that can be undertaken,\" Manfred said. \"I'm committed to the idea that we have a set of proposals out there and we continue to discuss those proposals in private.\"\nMLB has studied whether to restore the lower edge of the strike zone from just beneath the kneecap to its pre-1996 level — at the top of the kneecap. Management would like to install 20-second pitch clocks in an attempt to speed the pace of play — they have been used at Triple-A and Double-A for the past two seasons.\nPlayers also have been against limiting mound meetings. The least controversial change appears to be allowing a team to call for an intentional walk without the pitcher having to throw pitches.\n© The Associated Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-22T01:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:11:40.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
