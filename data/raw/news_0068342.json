As Colbert sees things, “It is the greatest achievement for African-Americans since … about four weeks ago when we had a black president.” Tonight! Trump believes he 'really started something' by hiring Dr. Ben Carson to lead the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/RKjT2RHwra \n— The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) February 22, 2017 \nThe Late Show airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET on CBS.
