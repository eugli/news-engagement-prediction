(Eric P. Davis / Pioneer Press) Jennifer Johnson .\nAccording to Jennifer Rubin, one of the show's three producers, more than 300 students are involved in this year's production, which includes about 40 short skits written by a team of parent volunteers. There are also 23 parody songs, with the majority of lyrics written by parent Sara Eng, Rubin said. \nThe variety show is open to all Roosevelt students, and no auditions are required, Rubin explained. Fifth-graders appear in the actual skits and behind-the-scenes production, while students in lower grades perform songs in small groups, she said. \n\"We want to make this a very inclusive event,\" Rubin said. \nSkits include parodies of \"The Amazing Race,\"\"American Pickers\" and \"The Real Housewives\" series. In the \"Housewives\" parody, called \"Real Housewives of Park Ridge,\" students depict mothers unhappy about having to pack school lunches because Roosevelt does not offer a hot lunch program every day. \nThe title of the variety show is a reference to Dr. Kevin Dwyer, Roosevelt's principal. \n\"We also have cameo appearances Dr. Dwyer himself,\" Rubin said. \"He'll pop in and do a little acting, which is great. The kids always like it when he gets involved in their skits.\" \nThe variety show is sponsored by the Roosevelt School PTO and is a fundraiser for the organization. More than 200 parent volunteers have worked with students on the production this year, Rubin said. \n\"There's not a lot of opportunities [for students] to stand in front of a large audience and practice a skill,\" she said. \"This is something that serves the kids well, not just from a social and community-building element, but it gives them the skills of presenting themselves, projecting and being confident on stage.\" \nTwitter: @Jen_Tribune", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:24:59.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
