The Banana Republic global style ambassador is shimmering from top to toe in a metallic sweater and a matching accordion-pleat skirt from the new Spring 2017 collection at the Soho store in New York. Peeking out of her Givenchy brogue booties are burgundy-glitter tights that appear as if they have been cut from the same Lurex cloth as her outfit, though Palermo will later explain the hosiery predates her tenure with the retailer. Since joining the team last September, Palermo has curated a section of Banana Republic’s website with a monthly edit of her favorite pieces. Now Palermo is expanding her role with the launch of three new pop-up shops located in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco stores, featuring a mix of both Banana Republic and third-party fashion and lifestyle finds, all of which have been handpicked by her. When doors opened on February 9, the pop-ups offered a peek inside Palermo’s universe. While the modern interiors reflect her design aesthetic, select labels on offer had been culled from her very own inner circle. “There are some great designers, like Jemma Wynne, whom I’ve known before they even started their collections,” Palermo said. “With the space, keeping it very light and cozy is sometimes best, because you can highlight the clothes a little bit more.” To further punctuate the setting, Palermo worked with the Staley-Wise Gallery in New York on a selection of photographs that are more than purely decorative; they’re up for sale. “It was about taking a very home feel and taking great basics and color—which is very important in how I get ready and get dressed—even if it’s not through clothes,” Palermo said. Her maltese, Mr. Butler (who for his part, was on the scene sporting a tangerine cable-knit sweater and lead) felt at home, too, thanks to a posh dog bed in the corner. “Butler is represented in most things that I do, and he always likes to leaves his stamps when he enters a room,” Palermo said. “We just figured that he would have his own little world.” The Banana Republic Soho Store Photo: Joe Schildhorn / BFA It’s no wonder than that Palermo’s favorite pieces in the pop-up shop (besides the Banana Republic cashmere goodies, which she says she “absolutely loves”), are the ones she turns to on a regular basis. “The [Tumi] Erin weekender is fantastic,” she said. “It’s something that’s part of my life and that I use all the time, and the same thing with Smythson and Rimowa.” Palermo’s rolling Rimowa suitcase is going to get more mileage on the Fall 2017 show circuit. “I’m not one for athleisure in the airport,” Palermo said. “I think you should be polished . . . but practical.” Moreover, her approach to Fashion Week dressing is similar to the way she designed the pop-up shops with a mix of transformative pieces anchored by tried-and-true staples. “It’s important to try different variations of things, but remain true to your own sense of style,” Palermo said. “And always have a statement coat.” Given that Palermo will be stepping into a designer role in creating a Fall 2017 capsule collection for the brand, to be shown next September, we expect she’ll have outerwear fully covered.
