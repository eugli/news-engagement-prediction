By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 27, 2017 7:03 PM Akhilesh Yadav stated that the BJP MP who dons safron robes can touch an electric wire and check whether there is power or not. (ANI) \nAs the crucial Uttar Pradesh assembly elections enter its fifth phase, Samajwadi Party leader and the state’s Chief Minister today hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) over their jibe on the ruling party on electric power supply issues in the state. Following BJP Member of Parliament (MP) Yogi Adityanath’s remarks on the lack of power supply in UP, Akhilesh Yadav stated that the BJP MP who dons safron robes can touch an electric wire and check whether there is power or not. \nAddressing an election rally in Gorakhpur, from which Yogi Adityanath is a BJP MP, Akhilesh said, “There is a ‘baba’ in the neighbourhood who has raised questions on power supply…I will only say that ‘babaji’ you can touch an electric wire and see whether there is power or not.” \nFurther slamming Yogi Adityanath, the SP leader targetted the BJP MP over the safron parties earlier remarks on ‘Kabristan’ and ‘samshanghats’. Joined by Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi at the rally, Akhilesh claimed that every house in Gorakhpur has a Samajwadi Party laptop and if elected to form government again, SP will be distributing smartphones also. \nAlso Watch: \nAddressing the public rally, the UP CM also hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and stated that in his three times tenure as the Chief Minister, Modi couldn’t construct metro in the state. He also took a jibe at the PM over his promises on bullet trains in the country and asked him to hurry up with the project as he will ‘not get another chance’ to form the government at the centre. \n“We have started Metro train (but) where is your bullet train?…it has been three years now since your government came to power, where has that train gone?…please hurry up as you will not get another chance. You have been chief minister of Gujarat three times but could not get a Metro there…we have started its work at three places,” said Akhilesh, slamming PM Modi over his remarks on development in Uttar Pradesh. \nReferring to the Prime Minister’s remark on mass copying in the state, Akhilesh asked, “Are examinations being held anywhere at this point of time…in BJP-ruled states (too) those who had leaked papers were caught.” \n“Modiji should tell when then US President Barack Obama had come, whom had he copied and got his suit stitched…we know that there was a rich man who got his name printed on his suit and the same has been done by Modiji,” Akhilesh said. \n(With inputs from agencies)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T15:41:17.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
