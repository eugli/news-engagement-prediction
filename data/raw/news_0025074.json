Ad Feedback \nThe resilience strategy sets out three goals: to ensure people are connected, empowered and feel part of a community; that decision-making at all levels is integrated and informed by knowledge about Wellington's shocks and stresses; and that homes, natural and built environment are healthy and robust. \nMendonca presented the draft strategy to the council's city strategy committee on Tuesday, and councillors will be asked to approve the plan on Thursday. \nHe believes the 30 focus areas are achievable, and Wellington is ready to move forward with it. \nSome of the proposals were a bit aspirational, but they were practical and achievable, he said. \n\"We were careful to ensure this was the case. Now it's just a question of timing around implementation and funding.\" \nHe was confident they would be funded because there was \"a good appetite\" for projects of that nature. \nProjects and initiatives requiring council funding that are not already provided for in the Long-Term Plan will be presented as part of Annual Plan or Long-Term Plan processes. \nIn the foreword of the draft, Wellington Mayor Justin Lester said the strategy laid out a coherent blueprint for dealing with future shocks and stresses. Some of the plans are short-term and tactical, others are long-term and strategic, but they all had people at the centre, he said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T12:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:27:12.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
