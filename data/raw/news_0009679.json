Sketchy, but not necessarily fake \nThat doesn’t necessarily mean this is wrong, especially with the LG G6 expected to sport an unusual aspect ratio too, but it does call the credibility of the leak into question, especially as it doesn't match previous resolution leaks . \nAnd that’s not the only odd thing, as the phone is also listed as the HTC 11, despite HTC itself strongly suggesting that its next flagship won’t launch under that name. \nAll that, coupled with how easy it would be to fake an About Phone screen, means you shouldn't base your next phone decision based solely on this. \nBut at least the timing is right: with the HTC 11 possibly launching in the next few months it wouldn’t be at all surprising if we were starting to see genuine screenshot leaks.
