Dasha Kuprienko \nPeople are trapped after a two car crash near Gibbston, Queenstown. \nA witness to the crash said one of the vehicles crossed the centre line. \nMike Grant, of Invercargill, was travelling toward Queenstown and said he got \"a hell of a fright\" when the crash happened in heavy rain. \n\"I don't know if [the car travelling toward Cromwell] lost grip but it just seemed to go on the other side of the road.\" \nWhen the cars crashed Grant had \"very little time to react\" but pulled over to the side of the road. \n\"I'm damn lucky because I had a gap to pull through because you are going at 100kmh so I had zero time to react. It just happened so quickly.\" \nHe said there appeared to be two people in each car. \nCromwell man Adrian Hopkinson said he was returning home from Queenstown with his boss when they saw a huge amount of smoke. Ad Feedback \n\"Everything was steaming and everyone was screaming. I've never seen anything like that before and I don't want to see it again.\" \nAn Australian nurse who was on an AJ Hackett Bungy bus was one of the first to help at the scene but was struggling to get a passenger from one of the cars, he said. \nHopkinson helped to remove the woman before the ambulance arrived and paramedics carried on giving CPR. \nAn Otago Rescue Helicopter was sent from Dunedin to the scene. \nPolice have reopened one lane of the road after a two-hour closure. Both lanes were expected to be open by 7pm. - Stuff ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:17:06.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
