If that is true, the truth must be told. \n\"Through decades of government policies initiated by Umno and BN, the country has become progressive, renowned and in the Islamic context, a model country,\" he said. Muhyiddin, who also touched on the current situation in the country, admitted that it will not be easy to defeat Barisan in the coming general election if there is no understanding among the opposition to have one-on-one fights. - Bernama <> <>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T12:16:17.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
