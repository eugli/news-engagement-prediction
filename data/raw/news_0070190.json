Unal (Getty) \nTalk about multitasking. \nWhile there is some dude running around in the Czech Republic having sex with cars , it appears that the couple in this story prefers having sex on moving vehicles instead. \nThe couple, captured by Leo Florentin and shared on Facebook, was shot in a highway in Paraguay, and appears to show a couple having sex (or at least trying to have sex) on a moving motorbike while speeding down a highway. Florentin even managed to snap a photo of it, as well as video. \nLet’s first take a look at the photo thanks to Florentin’s Facebook . Couple Captured Having Sex On Speeding Motorbike While On Highway Photo: Facebook \nPolice are of course reportedly investigating the footage, and the couple could face a fine of 3 million Paraguayan Guarani (about $540) if they are caught. The charges can be steeper if it is discovered this dude was drunk before hopping on his bike. \nThis is what Florentin had to say about this situation: “This is already a situation of national emergency, it’s now or never because otherwise we will have a generation of young mutilated, dead and cold.” Wow, that’s pretty dark, Florentin. \nTake a look at the footage Florentin shot of the couple. \nI mean, if you want to reignite the spark in your relationship may I suggest just a bed and breakfast? That’s just one dude’s suggestion. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:29:32.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
