However, Ashish Nehra has defied this and set a different precedent. Hard work and fitness can give great results. I am also working hard and maintaining fitness. I have lost a lot of weight and done strength training. I hope I bowl well in the IPL and make my son’s dream of seeing me again in India jersey come true,” Gony, 33, told HT. \nGony suffered a string of injuries which forced him to miss out on Ranji Trophy action for a few years, and his comeback in the last season was unexpected.
