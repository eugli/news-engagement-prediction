Five days after Reyes felt pain spiral through his pitching arm, the Cardinals confirmed Wednesday the diagnosis they feared: Their young righthander will have Tommy John surgery as early as Thursday in Jupiter. His sudden and complete absence from this year’s rotation throws wide open a competition that will see two former All-Stars, a revitalized Michael Wacha or repurposed Trevor Rosenthal, make their claim to the fifth starter’s job. \n“Clearly he was someone who we had talked about competing for that fifth spot,” general manager John Mozeliak said. “So now we have one less. I don’t think it’s a panic mode by any means where we have to go out and fill. Overall, I still feel we have that depth, and that’s why you collect it. \n“As you look at the depth question, now it’s a great opportunity.” \nReyes entered spring training as the No. 1 pitching prospect in the game and a favorite for the National League Rookie of the Year award, but not a certain starter for the Cardinals. The club expected him to have an impact in that role at some point this season, even for the majority of the season. The idea was to pit him against Wacha and others for the starting job to open the year. That changed this past Friday when, during a throwing session near his home in Elizabeth, N.J., he tried to throw an offspeed pitch. \nDiscomfort bolted through his elbow, and he notified the Cardinals. Travel delays meant that he did not see the team’s medical staff until Tuesday, the first official workout day of spring training. An MRI later that day revealed a complete tear of his UCL, and there was no other option but Tommy John surgery. Rehab requires at least a year. \nThe Cardinals told Reyes on Wednesday morning. \n“Apparently this is what has to happen,” Reyes said. “It was just the kind of pain throughout my elbow that I haven’t felt before. The thoughts that have been going through my head is, ‘It (stinks).’ … That’s something you never want to go through, and unfortunately it’s here.” \nThe injury happened while Reyes was on the major-league roster so he will spend the entire year on the major-league disabled list gathering service time. This year will count for the six years he needs to become a free agent. \nThe Cardinals have little interest at this point at pursuing a starter from outside the organization. The available free agents are not inspiring. \nCardinals officials commented on Reyes’ surgery shortly before several of the candidates for the No. 5 spot took the mounds nearby for their first throws in front of coaches. \nThree years removed from arriving at spring as a sensation like Reyes, Wacha got his first chance to show the Cardinals the work he put in to build up strength and prevent what has become a chronic shoulder concern. While Reyes’ youth and efficiency were questions he brought into the season, the Cardinals are without many certainties on the starting staff. Adam Wainwright is coming off the most frustrating season of his career, Mike Leake had his struggles heightened by a faulty defense, and Lance Lynn is coming back from Tommy John surgery after missing the entire 2016 season. \nCarlos Martinez, the Cardinals’ leading pitcher last year, carries the least concern, while challengers to Wacha all have some hurdle to clear. Like Wacha, Rosenthal had an injury last year that led to troubles. Rosenthal had his elbow examined out of concern for a severe injury. Tyler Lyons and Marco Gonzales, two lefties, are both coming back from surgery, and righthander Luke Weaver strayed from his strengths in spot major league starts last year. Weaver, Lyons, Wacha and Rosenthal all threw bullpen sessions Wednesday. \nWacha’s “was as good as I’ve seen him throw in a long time,” manager Mike Matheny said. “The base. The fluidity of it. Right now, we don’t look so much at the end results but how all the components look. He looked to me as right as I’ve seen him in a long time.” \nWacha spent the winter building strength in and around his shoulder, throughout his core, and even into his legs. He did not arrive at spring training more musclebound, but with “the right muscles firing in the position they need to be to throw a baseball the correct way.” Two of the three previous years have been interrupted by a stress reaction in his scapula, and this winter he geared his workouts around alleviating the stress that causes the unusual injury. \nThe Cardinals have expanded the tests they use to determine weaknesses that could lead to future injury, and Wacha has continued to take those. \nIn 2013, Reyes received treatment for a partial ligament tear in his right elbow, one that at the time did not require surgery. He had shoulder troubles in 2015, and in recent years, the Cardinals revealed, had missed some time with flexor irritation. In January, when the Cardinals examined players, Reyes did not have any issues. He said the soreness emerged while he was throwing Friday, and the Cardinals said it’s possible the rupture was an “event” injury, not wear over time. \n“Both times I’ve been hurt I’ve come back and I’ve felt 100 percent,” Reyes said. “We treat it when we feel it. Those injuries have never come back until my elbow started bothering me now.” \nReyes said he did not increase or hasten his preparation for spring because of his possible role in the World Baseball Classic next month. The Dominican Republic’s team had him on their taxi squad of pitchers. \nA year ago, closer to the end of spring, the Cardinals learned that shortstop Jhonny Peralta would start on the disabled list with a hand injury, and that upended the Cardinals’ planned infield. Reyes’ injury comes early in spring at a position where the Cardinals have advertised their depth, and still it causes a familiar sinking feeling. In 2011, Wainwright’s elbow gave way in the first weeks of spring training, and the presumed ace missed the entire season. In 2013, both closer Jason Motte and starting shortstop Rafael Furcal had elbow injuries that required reconstruction and cost them the season. \nIn 2011, Kyle McClellan moved into the rotation for 17 starts before a midseason trade keyed the Cardinals for their World Series title run. Pete Kozma took over for Furcal in 2013 and struggled at the plate but was one of the league’s best fielders, and Edward Mujica would eventually get 37 saves in the ninth as Motte’s replacement. \n“It’s obviously very disappointing. We had very high expectations for (Reyes),” Mozeliak said. “It’s a frustrating injury any time you lose this type of talent. … We have lost some key pitchers on day one. We have to remain optimistic and positive. In this game, there are injuries, and when you think about timing, sure it’s not great, but when is it ever great?” \nDerrick Goold", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T03:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:47:01.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
