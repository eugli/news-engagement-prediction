(AP Photo/Roger Steinman) By David Moore , Staff Writer Contact David Moore on Twitter: @DavidMooreDMN \nDak Prescott has already picked up one award this week. \nHe could make it two, unless a teammate and friend interferes. \nEither Prescott or Ezekiel Elliott will walk away from the NFL Honors celebration Saturday night as the league's Offensive Rookie of the Year. Both players were essential to the Cowboys' resurgence and now face off in one of the more interesting races this awards season. \nFans selected Prescott as the Pepsi Rookie of the Year on Friday. Media members from around the country voted on the award that will be handed out this weekend. No one should maintain√Ç that Dak Prescott is the next Tom Brady; but they do share some intriguing traits \nSo who wins? The rookie quarterback who led the Cowboys to a 13-3 record, or the rookie running back who led the league in rushing? \n\"I give it to Zeke,\" Prescott said. \"He's done a hell of a job all year long. Teams honing in on the run game allowed the play action, allowed the pass game to come open and allowed my job to be a lot easier.\" \nIt's time to turn to an informal, man-on-the-street poll in an attempt to establish a favorite. \nIt just so happens some of the men on the street here in Houston in the days leading up to Super Bowl LI play in the NFL. \n\"Oooh, that's a good one,\" said Washington cornerback Josh Norman. \"I like Zeke, how hard he runs. I think the offensive line is just mauling people, not to take anything away from him, of course. \n\"I like Dak. He doesn't make mistakes. \n\"I think I'll go with Dak, man. It's hard to (play quarterback) and he's doing it at a rookie level. You can't say nobody but Dak right now.\" \nOne of Norman's teammates also sides with Prescott. \n\"They both played at such a high level,\" quarterback Kirk Cousins said. \"But I'm partial to the quarterbacks. I know how much is on their shoulders as the quarterback of the team, so I'm going to say Dak.\" \nDenver linebacker Von Miller, the Most Valuable Player in last year's Super Bowl, offers an interesting solution. \n\"They should just split it in half,\" Miller said. \"Both of those guys have done amazing things in their rookie seasons. Look at Dak. He had the most wins as a rookie quarterback ever (actually tied Ben Roethlisberger with 13) and we all know what Zeke did. \n\"I say split it right down the middle, man, and give it to both of those guys. I say give Offensive Player of the Year to Dak and give Rookie of the Year to Zeke. That way we can keep them both happy.\" \nA total of 17 awards will be announced Saturday evening. Possible Cowboys wins aren't restricted to Rookie of the Year and Offensive Player of the Year. Relive Ezekiel Elliott's dominant rookie season for the Cowboys \nJason Garrett is in the conversation for Coach of the Year. There's also an award for the Built Ford Tough Offensive Line of the Year. \nIs there a more dominant offensive line in the league than the Cowboys'? \nBut that award doesn't roll off the tongue like Rookie of the Year. While Prescott and Elliott have been consistently and genuinely supportive of each other, do they at least have a side bet on which one of them will win? \n\"No side bet,\" Prescott said. \"I think he'd bet on me, I'd bet on him. It's all fun. \n\"We love each other and we both know that. I think I know for a fact my job, it wouldn't be as easy if I didn't have a guy like him in the backfield with me. \n\"No matter who wins it, me, him or somebody else, it's shared between us two. I think we know what we did this year for this team, this organization was fun. It's a year we'll never forget and we're excited for next year. \n\"We're excited for the next month or so to get back to work and get back at it.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:58:11.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
