Gov. Dan Patrick blasted Ogg's proposal as akin to Houston becoming a sanctuary city on low-level drug crimes.\nPUSH BACK: Patrick blasts Ogg's pot policy, but other lawmakers more supportive\nWASHINGTON â€” A landmark report reviewing more than 10,000 scientific studies of marijuana since 1999 has concluded that weed has some medical benefits, but also comes with plenty of health risks. The report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine aims to provide conclusive evidence about the effects of marijuana â€” something thatâ€™s not very easy to come by, according to scientists. Researchers said there is conclusive or substantial evidence that chronic pain, along with nausea caused by chemotherapy, can be relieved by marijuana, according to their report. However, the report warns that using the drug may increase the risk of developing mental health problems, such as schizophrenia. The report says there is evidence that smoking marijuana can trigger heart attacks in patients already diagnosed with heart disease. The report links early marijuana use with substance abuse later in life. It also says using the drug increases the chances of respiratory problems, vehicle accidents, and low birth weight in babies born to mothers who smoke it. Around 22 million Americans used marijuana in the past month, according to a recent survey cited by NPR â€” despite the fact the federal government considers it a crime. Pot is legal for medical use in more than half of the U.S. states, with eight states allowing citizens to blaze it up just for kicks. The scientists said that a whole lot more research on the drug is required, which would be a lot easier if the federal government removed its regulatory red tape.
