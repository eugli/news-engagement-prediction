The order also banned Syrian refugees indefinitely. \nIts implementation caused chaos at airports worldwide, as travelers were prevented from boarding airplanes or sent back to the countries from which they had just arrived. Even legal residents of the U.S. were detained for hours, sometimes without any access to legal representation or food. \nHours after the order was signed, massive protests erupted across the country, including at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport . Soon, the White House issued a clarification that the travel ban would not apply to green card holders, or to legal U.S. residents with dual citizenship. \nBut that did little to stem the confusion, and soon it was reported that few individuals outside the Trump administration had been briefed in advance of the order’s implementation. Gen. John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, found out the order had been signed by watching T.V. , and although some Congressional staffers had helped write the order, they had done so without the knowledge or consent of their bosses . \nSeveral GOP leaders, including Texas Sen. John Cornyn -- the no. 2 Republican in the Senate -- confirmed that they had no advance knowledge of the wide-sweeping order. \nLater, Cornyn acknowledged the roll-out had been messy, but said he supported the administration’s stated aim of more thoroughly vetting those who wish to enter the country. \n“They got into a big hurry,” he told reporters . “But public safety is the No. 1 responsibility of the federal government, so I certainly support the vetting of refugees coming into the country.” \nWithin hours, the Trump administration had received the first of several legal defeats, as the order was challenged by the ACLU and other civil rights groups. First, a federal judge in Brooklyn issued a ruling that temporarily prevented anyone who had entered the country on a valid visa from being deported. \nLater, another federal court in Seattle temporarily halted enforcement of the ban entirely, finding that several states had proven they faced “immediate and irreparable injury” as a result of the order’s implementation. \n“The Executive Order adversely affects the States’ residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations, and freedom to travel,” wrote Judge James Robart , who was appointed by President George W. Bush. \nImplementation of the order would also adversely impact states’ public universities, tax bases and public funds, Robart wrote, noting that thousands of legal immigrants had been kept from their homes, schools and families as a result of the ban. \nTrump lashed out at Robart on Twitter, deriding him as a ‘so-called’ judge and implying that he would be to blame for any terrorist attack that might take place on U.S. soil. \n“What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?” he tweeted. “Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system.” \nIn a unanimous decision, three judges on the 9th Circuit rejected the Trump administration's arguments in a ruling issued Thursday night. The administration will likely appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to implement the travel ban even while its constitutionality is challenged in court.
