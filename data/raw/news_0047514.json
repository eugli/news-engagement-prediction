Sought out for his technical yet natural-looking cuts, King’s client list is a virtual roll call of Young British London: Poppy Delevingne (sister of Cara), Lottie Moss (sister of Kate), and Imogen Waterhouse (sister of Suki), are all loyal customers, as are Jamie Dornan, Zayn Malik, and Niall Horan. Of the low-maintenance looks that are his signature, says King: “I’m known for workable hair that you can continue to do yourself after you leave the salon. You won’t struggle with it, you can change your parting back and forth, and it’s going to look great as it grows out.” Photo: Courtesy of Larry King Salon King, who coined the hashtag #asociallifeforyourhair for the opening, designed the space to have a welcoming lounge-like atmosphere where friends and clients could pop in for a catch up, a cocktail, and a cut or color, too, if so required. “I wanted this to be a social space,” he says. “You can meet your boyfriend for lunch or a coffee while your highlights develop instead of wasting a day getting your hair done. This isn’t just where you come for a haircut.” (The neighboring private members club SKC gives the salon full access to its restaurant and bar menu.) Of course, a salon-owner who coins his own hashtags hasn’t forgotten the social media needs of his clients. King designed a Selfie Hot Seat with supremely flattering lighting for documenting hair transformations, as well as an Instagram-ready powder room featuring a photo backdrop of the Rocky Mountains. Of the time customers spend lingering in it, he admits with a laugh, “Everyone loves taking selfies in the loo.” 34-36 Harrington Road, London SW7 3ND44 207 584 6162 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:31:05.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
