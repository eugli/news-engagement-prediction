Sir Nicholas Wall, who retired on health grounds in 2012, died last week at the age of 71 after 'years of suffering'. In a death notice published today, his family said the judge - who was President of the Family Division for two years until 2012 - had 'died by his own hand'. They added that Sir Nicholas, who was married and had four children and two grandchildren, had been diagnosed with a rare dementia of the fronto-temporal lobe. The notice in the Times read: 'Wall, Sir Nicholas Peter Rathbone, past President of the Family Division died by his own hand on 17th of February 2017, aged 71. 'He is mourned by his wife Margaret and his children Imogen, Emma, Rosalind and Simon and his grandsons Joshua and Arthur. 'After years of suffering he was recently diagnosed with a rare dementia of the fronto-temporal lobe.' The tribute also included a verse from Tennyson's poem Tithonus: 'The woods decay, the woods decay and fall/ The vapours weep their burthen to the ground/ Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath/ And after many a summer dies the swan.' A graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, Sir Nicholas was called to the Bar in 1969, before being appointed a High Court Judge in the Family Division in 1993 and the Court of Appeal and Privy Council in 2004.
