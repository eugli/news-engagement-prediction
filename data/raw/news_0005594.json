NFL referee (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:59 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:59 p.m. ET \nThe head of the NFL Referees Association is concerned about players openly criticizing officials for calls. \nScott Green, a former NFL referee, told USA Today Sports he wants to speak to the NFL Players' Association about athletes reining in their comments. \nMORE: 40 most hated NFL players of all time \nThe report cited critical remarks from the likes of Josh Norman and Travis Kelce, who were both fined by the NFL this season for what the league considered personal attacks on officials. \n“We appreciate that the league reprimands guys for doing that, but we also like it to be known that in those instances, all those calls were correct. That, to us, is equally as important, that the public knows that just because somebody complained and said it was horrible and the guy is horrible and he shouldn’t be on the field — it’s important that word gets back out that, well, just so you’re aware, we reviewed those plays and (the penalties) were there.” \nUpholding the public's perception of game officials' integrity is the primary concern for Green, who added that continued high-profile criticism is unfair to a group that has a strong track record of getting calls right. \n“I’m not going to say we don’t miss calls. We obviously do,” Green said. “But players miss plays and coaches miss plays as well. When we’re in the high-90s (percentage-wise), we’re doing pretty good for basically getting that one look when we make the call and then obviously there’s replay to help. To say that officiating is getting worse is just not correct.” Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:23:26.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
