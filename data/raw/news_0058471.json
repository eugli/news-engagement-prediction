I couldn’t see where she went, she just wasn’t there anymore,” he told police.\nHer mother, Vivian, told the court she had lost her only child, who was born after an earlier miscarriage.\n“Tani was our rainbow baby and very special,” she said in her victim impact statement.\nHer father, Don, said: “To say I am heartbroken would be an understatement.”\nmedia_camera The scene of the fatal crash in Melbourne last year. Picture: Sarah Matray\nMr McWilliams said Ms Nayler’s body was thrown about 84m through the air.\nDavison lost control of the car, hit a pole and he ran from the scene, past her body.\nHe disposed of his clothes before he was arrested 45 minutes later. It is estimated his blood alcohol reading at the time of the crash was between 0.129 and 0.228.\nDavison had been drinking with friends that night before going to the CBD, where he stole the rental car after being refused entry to the nightclub.\nThe then 22-year-old had recently moved to Melbourne from Christchurch.\nHis defence lawyer said Davison’s “10 minutes of utter madness” were at odds with his usual behaviour.\n“It is 10 minutes that has left him ashamed of himself and deeply remorseful,” Ian Hill QC said.\n“He is very much aware of the suffering and misery that he has caused others.”\nCulpable driving causing death carries a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment.\nJudge Christopher Ryan said Davison will likely be deported after serving jail time.\nHe will be sentenced on March 17.\nOriginally published as ‘The car hit her and didn’t slow down’", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/new-zealand-man-guilty-of-melbourne-hitrun-death/news-story/89ca6a047a83295ff8c39dcf670172ab", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9854f7722b6deb8c1a1a4b432ee5ea3c?width=316", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/01e676398351ab55beddca51fd462c7d?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/89ca6a047a83295ff8c39dcf670172ab?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop"], "published": "2017-02-21T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:25:12.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
