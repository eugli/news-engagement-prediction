The economy would suffer, especially in Texas , with fewer jobs available for native-born U.S. citizens, not more. \nImmigrants — about half of whom are undocumented — make up about 21 percent of Texas' workforce, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Undocumented immigrants contributed $17.7 billion to the state's economic output, a 2006 analysis by the Texas comptroller's office found, and pay more in taxes to the state than they consume in services. \nNationally, unauthorized immigrants contribute 3 percent of America's economic output — a number that would rise if they gained legal status, according to economists, since it would give them access to better job opportunities.

The rise of Donald Trump has put farmworker advocates on the defensive, says an official for an immigration reform group.﻿ Migrant workers harvest strawberries near Oxnard, Calif., in 2013.... \nSince the election, even more research has come out on the impact of immigration, legal and otherwise. \nOne of the most interesting studies came from Michael Clemens of the Center for Global Development. He found that when Mexican braceros — farm workers brought in to work for a defined period of time — were suddenly expelled from the U.S. in the 1960s in an effort to raise wages for U.S. farm workers, nothing of the sort happened. Instead, farm owners invested in technology to do the work with fewer people. Wages stayed as low as ever. \nThe end of the bracero program marked the beginning of the upswing in illegal immigration. Although the flow of illegal immigrants from Mexico has slowed dramatically in recent years —more Mexicans now leave the U.S. than come in — researchers from the Dallas Fed argued in January that the best way to reduce the flow further without disrupting the industries that rely on immigrants would be to liberalize visa programs and award more work permits. \nThat's why in Texas, even politicians who talk tough on illegal immigrants tend not to crack down on employers, knowing the labor would be very difficult to replace. \nThe impact of immigration, however, isn't just about farm workers and dishwashers. Researchers from the University of Chicago and Harvard Business School found that technology areas with greater involvement from foreign-born inventors generated more patents, suggesting that immigrants contributed more to innovation than U.S.-born citizens. \nOf course, it would help to have more data on how immigrants affect the Texas economy and finances. In that spirit, state Sen. Don Huffines , R-Dallas, has filed a bill that would require a biannual accounting of the costs to the state of illegal immigrants. \n\"Texans deserve a formalized and ongoing process by which we can account for the costs taxpayers bear as a result of the federal government's failures to secure the border and to provide for a functioning system of legal immigration,\" Huffines said in a press release . \nHuffines is probably right that a functioning system of legal immigration would improve the productivity of immigrants as well as the state's finances. But even under the status quo, it's likely that ongoing studies would find immigrants in Texas to be a net benefit, not a cost. \nIn fact, that appears to be why the comptroller's 2006 study hasn't been repeated since .
