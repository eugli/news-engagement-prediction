Milktooth chef/owner Jonathan Brooks is on the list for a best new chef in the Great Lakes medal. So is Bluebeard chef Abbi Merriss . Both Fletcher Place restaurants and their top toques have been awash in national media accolades over the past two years. Both were also James Beard Award semifinalists in 2016 in the Great Lakes category. In 2012, under Merriss' co-direction, Bluebeard was a James Beard Award semifinalist for best new restaurant in America. Café Patachou founder Martha Hoover earned a semifinalist spot among outstanding restaurateurs in the nation. The award recognizes a \"working restaurateur who sets high national standards in restaurant operations and entrepreneurship.\" All profits from Hoover's Public Greens concept in Broad Ripple go to feeding kids suffering food insecurity. \nHoover was nominated for the same award in 2013 and 2016. Her Patachou Inc. restaurants also include Café Patachou, Petite Chou Bistro and Napolese pizzeria. \nChef Aaron Butts of The Golden in Fort Wayne is also on the best chefs Great Lakes list. He is well-known among Indy foodies thanks to his contributions at chefs dinners in the city over the past few years. The longtime chef at Joseph Decius, a Wagyu beef shine in Roanoke, left that post at the end of 2015 to open The Golden in 2016. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. As far as chefs are concerned, this New York City address one of the most important places in America. The Greenwich Village brownstone, dating to 1844, is where America's first television celebrity chef, James Beard lived until he died in 1985. Beard was a cookbook writer who defined America’s diverse regional cuisines, proving we’re not all hamburgers and hot dogs. He focused on local ingredients and cooking styles, the kind of farm-to-table circumstances so popular today. Ken Goodman Fullscreen The Greenwich Village brownstone known as the James Beard House hosts the James Beard Foundation, which annually bestows the James Beard Awards, known as the Oscars of the food world. The address is culinary central in America. Just about every professional chef dreams of cooking a dinner here. Five Indiana chefs and one bartender join the ranks Aug. 6, 2015 for Chefs Night Off Indy at the James Beard House. Ken Goodman Fullscreen Everything about the James Beard House is more humble and homey that you might expect. This is the main entrance. Dinner guests ring a little doorbell just inside. They have to walk to the kitchen to get to the dining room. Ken Goodman Fullscreen James Beard at home. The so-called \"dean of American cookery\" was a Portland, Ore., native (1903-1985) who authored 20 cookbooks. He was also a caterer, cooking instructor, syndicated columnist and the person considered America's first television food celebrity. He initially appeared in 1946 on an NBC show titled \"I Love to Eat.\" James Beard Foundation Fullscreen Buy Photo The James Beard House stands four stories high. When Beard lived there, the top two floors were rented apartments. The second floor was Beard's private residence. The first floor is where Beard taught cooking classes ann staged dinners. There are no elevators. Liz Biro/The Star Fullscreen Buy Photo What was once a fourth floor apartment now serves as a private dining room, meeting space and James Beard Foundation offices. Cookbooks of all sorts fill shelves, but they were not James Beard's books. The furniture is not original, either. Beard estate was sold, as he was in debt when he died in 1985. Liz Biro/The Star Fullscreen Buy Photo When chefs from all across America come to cook at the James Beard House, this is where they work. Liz Biro/The Star Fullscreen James Beard in the Beard House kitchen while he lived at the house. Beard championed American regional cooking, showing the world that U.S. food was not just hamburgers and hot dogs. His \"James Beard's American Cookery\" (Little, Brown and Co., 1972) remains recognized as the \"bible of American cooking.\" James Beard Foundation James Beard loved Oriental design, as evidenced by this jacket he wore for serving dinners. Liz Biro/The Star Fullscreen Buy Photo James Beard loved the Orient's vibrant colors and designs, as evidenced by this chef coat, which hangs in a frame at the James Beard House. Beard's love of cooking dated back to his childhood, but his career launched after he was expelled from Portland's Reed College in 1922 for homosexual activity. Beard came to New York City to work in theater. He ended up in the catering business. Liz Biro/The Star Fullscreen Buy Photo Much of the original decor at the James Beard House was removed after James Beard died in 1985. A few of Beard's things remain in the kitchen. These drawings of desserts are among them. Liz Biro/The Star Fullscreen Buy Photo The view of the kitchen as guests walk through to the dining room. The world map wallpaper at the rear was installed by James Beard. Liz Biro/The Star Fullscreen Buy Photo Another James Beard original is this spice cabinet in the kitchen. Beard's own sticky fingers opened these doors many times during cooking classes and dinners. Liz Biro/The Star Fullscreen Buy Photo James Beard taught cooking classes in the kitchen where chefs dream of cooking at the James Beard House. Beard wanted to be an actor, but he found celebrity chef and cookbook author to be more profitable. Liz Biro/The Star Fullscreen Buy Photo James Beard's signature look was an apron and a bow tie. These three are among various Beard mementos displayed at the James Beard House in New York City's Greenwich Village. Liz Biro/The Star Fullscreen Buy Photo A month from James Beard's busy July 1970 calendar. Beard ran with culinary greats like Julia Child and M.F.K Fisher. Before Child was famous, she looked up and aspired to be like James Beard. Liz Biro/The Star James Beard's private living space on the second floor of the James Beard House is now the main dining room where public dinners are served. Ken Goodman Fullscreen Buy Photo The bathroom serving the James Beard House main dining room is arranged as it was when Beard lived in the house. Lots of mirrors and marble floors decorate the space. Liz Biro/The Star Paintings of James Beard hang throughout the James Beard House, established in 1986 by longtime Beard friend Peter Kump, who also owned a New York City cooking school. Ken Goodman A raised nook in the main dining room of the James Beard House originally served as James Beard's bedroom. If you go, look up. Mirrors line the ceiling, as they did when Beard lived there. Ken Goodman Like this topic?
