Ghana and Cameroon are two of the continent’s mightiest football nations but it has been a painfully long time since either of them were kings – especially for Ghana, who haven’t been No1 in Africa since Toto were No1 in America with Africa . Sorry, that’s an unwieldy way of saying 1982. As for Cameroon, they’ve won the tournament four times since then but it has still been 15 years since they could be called the Indomitable Lions without someone raising a quibble. \nFunny thing is, Cameroon have exceeded expectations by even making it to the semi-final this time. I could elaborate on that but there’s no point because Jonathan Wilson already has . Ghana, meanwhile, will catch all manner of flak if they fail here, what with them having stuttered for much of the last two years. Progressing to the final would go some way towards atonement, though for full redemption they would have to reverse an annoying recent trend of defeats to Egypt. We’ll peruse the line-ups shortly, but in the meantime you should could consider The Fiver’s bold forecast for this match .
