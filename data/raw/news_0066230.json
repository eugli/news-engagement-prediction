By Steve Granitz/WireImage/Getty Images. Don’t you hate it when professional obligations get in the way of your very important television-watching? Donald Trump sure must. The TV-obsessed president reportedly still manages to get in several hours of cable news every day—but according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer, a formal commitment might cut in on Trump’s screen time during Hollywood’s biggest night. At Wednesday’s White House briefing, a reporter asked Spicer whether Trump plans to watch the Oscars on February 26. After noting that the entertainment industry—which welcomed Trump for a gaggle of TV and film cameos in the 1980s and 1990s—”is known for being rather far to the left in its opinions,” Spicer replied that the president has another engagement that night: “I think the president will be hosting the Governors’ Ball that night. The First Lady’ has put a lot of time into this event. . . and I have a feeling that that’s where the president and the First Lady are going to be focused on Sunday night.” (That event, a ball for United States governors , is not to be confused with the Academy’s yearly Governors Ball, its official post-Oscar celebration. The more you know . . . ) \nhttps://twitter.com/colinjones/status/834469391584677888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw This must be a real blow for a man who’s got a long, proud history of publicly hating on the Oscars. As The Daily Beast pointed out Wednesday , Trump has traditionally treated the Oscars the way incredulous viewers treat The Bachelor —as an unbridled opportunity to spew snark on every facet of the show. Trump groused about Sacha Baron Cohen pranking Ryan Seacrest on the Oscars red carpet in 2012 . . . . . . and ranted about a “very average” show that rewarded a foreigner playing Abraham Lincoln (he “did not think” that Daniel Day-Lewis “was good in Lincoln at all”) and Django Unchained, “probably one of the most racist movies I’ve ever seen and a disgrace,” in 2013 . . . . . . and acted like a one-man peanut gallery during the 2014 ceremony. . .
