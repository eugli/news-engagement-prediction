But he said he decided it was too dangerous to leave the weapon. \n\"The airport is not far away and it could cause disasters if it was placed here for a reason,\" he wrote. \n\"The airplanes here are an easy target because they fly at very low altitude and this is the best position for this weapon to be used.\" An image of the missile launcher Ibrahim Yousry posted on social media. (Image: Facebook). \nThe weapon did not appear to be loaded with a missile, he added. \nWith a maximum range of 4km, the missile launcher could down a low-flying commercial plane landing or taking-off from the nearby airport. \nIn his post, Yousry expressed alarm at finding the weapon. \n\"The airplanes here are an easy target because they fly at very low altitude and this is the best position for this weapon to be used.\" \nIts discovery poses a headache for Western countries such as Britain which closely monitors airport security across Egypt and is weighing up whether to resume tourist flights to Sharm el-Sheikh after a Russian jet was blown up by terrorists linked to Islamic State in 2015.
