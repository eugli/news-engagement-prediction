From The Washington Post/Getty Images. Melania Trump seems to have chosen the slogan that best represents her brand these days, and it is #PoweroftheFirstLady. She’s used the hashtag twice out of the five tweets on the official FLOTUS account . Once after an anodyne statement about “empowering the next generation with values,” which captions a photo with Akie Abe, wife of the Japanese prime minister, and most recently in response to tweets from model-turned-actress Emily Ratajkowski. In a series of three tweets on Monday, Ratajkowski, who has been attending various New York Fashion Week events, wrote, “Sat next to a journalist from the NYT last night who told me ‘Melania is a hooker.’ Whatever your politics it’s crucial to call this out for what it is: slut shaming. I don't care about her nudes or sexual history and no one should. Gender specific attacks are disgusting sexist bullshit.” The New York Times, for its part, issued a statement about its reporter’s conversation to Politico, saying , “The comment was not intended to be public, but it was nonetheless completely inappropriate and should not have occurred. Editors have talked to the reporter in question about the lapse.” Trump finally weighed in on Monday night, responding with a sort of Lean In -lite feminist panacea of a statement. \nhttps://twitter.com/FLOTUS/status/831303325886906368 So is “Power of the First Lady” her new catch phrase? Given that the whole kerfuffle began with a lawsuit that suggested her intention was to use her position as FLOTUS to advance her personal brand economically, don't be surprised if “Power of the First Lady” Christmas ornaments are soon available next to the “Make America Great Again” ones, both for the low price of $99 . A more charitable guess is that Trump's venture into hashtag-branding will eventually support the cause she’s chosen to advance during her time in the East Wing, which she hinted during the presidential campaign would be anti-bullying.
