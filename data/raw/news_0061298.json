Racial profiling has been part of the U.S. criminal justice system for as long as there has been a U.S. criminal justice system, and part of North American colonial justice systems in the centuries prior to its formation.While little has been done to root out the problem, it is at least acknowledged as a problem today--a considerable improvement over the explicit policy-level endorsements of racial profiling that characterized law enforcement treatment of people of color in centuries past.

It was the only one of many colonial Spanish criminal justice mandates, established ostensibly to promote law and order in the New World, that used a racial profiling policy against American Indians.

He was acquitted in three consecutive trials by fellow colonists, who refused to punish a white man for killing an American Indian. The governor, frustrated with the bizarre verdict, ordered a fourth trial, at which point Elkin was finally found guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter.

There is abundant evidence to suggest that pro-slavery governments sometimes arrested free African Americans as \"fugitive slaves,\" transferring them to slave traders for later sale. Public domain.

Many of the slaves, particularly the lynching victims, were selected more or less at random, their bodies mutilated and displayed on fenceposts as a warning to any slaves who might choose to rebel.

Deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,\" would have made racial profiling illegal had it been enforced by the courts. As it stood, it only made racial profiling policies less formal; racial profiling policies, once written explicitly into law by legislatures, would now have to be conducted in a more subtle way.

Mitchell Palmer, an avowed enemy of those first-generation European-American immigrants he described as \"hyphenated Americans,\" ordered the notorious Palmer Raids in response to a series of small-scale terrorist attacks perpetrated by German- and Russian-American immigrants. The raids led to dossiers on some 150,000 first-generation immigrants and the arrest and summary deportation of more than 10,000 immigrants without trial. Public domain.

United States , the U.S. Supreme Court held that ethnic profiling is not unconstitutional and may be practiced in times of national emergency. The ruling, which defended the involuntary internment of an estimated 110,000 Japanese Americans on the sole basis of ethnicity and national origin during World War II, has been roundly condemned by legal scholars ever since.

According to the data, black drivers--accounting for 17 percent of the population--made up 70 percent of drivers searched and had a 28.4 percent chance of carrying contraband. White drivers, despite having a slightly higher 28.8 percent chance of carrying contraband, were searched far less often.

Some were deported; some are released; hundreds captured overseas remain imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay , where they remain imprisoned without trial to this day.

Bush signed an executive order banning the use of race, color, and ethnicity to profile suspects in 70 different federal agencies. The executive order has been criticized as toothless, but at least it represents an executive branch policy against racial profiling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:00:48.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
