Listen: Reaction to City's win on BBC Radio 5 live \nIt was the third straight game in which the Argentine had been left on the bench by Guardiola. The Spaniard said: \"Sergio played good. He fought and scored a goal for his confidence and I am so happy for him. He was important before the game and is still important.\" \nAguero's \"goal\" was officially recorded as a Tyrone Mings own goal after the striker's effort was diverted into his own net by the Bournemouth defender. 'Difficult to win the title' \nRaheem Sterling's opener and Mings' own goal in the second half allowed City to extend their unbeaten run to five games in all competition. \nThe result means they move from fifth to second in the table, eight points behind leaders Chelsea. \nAsked if they can win the title, Guardiola said: \"It's so difficult. Chelsea have to lose three games and we have to win all the games. You know how difficult it is to win games in the Premier League. \n\"We will take it game by game. Now we are second but the gap to third, fourth, fifth and sixth is nothing. The gap to Chelsea is still massive. Game by game, we have to improve.\" Analysis \nFormer Chelsea striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 live \n\"I don't think City can catch Chelsea. It's too big a gap with Chelsea performing as they have done, but it was a comfortable performance from City - they are brilliant going forward.\" Injuries mount for Howe On-loan midfielder Jack Wilshere has played in 22 of Bournemouth's 25 league games this season \nBournemouth had injury concerns of their own as midfielder Jack Wilshere and defender Simon Francis both limped off in the first half. \nEarlier this month, the Cherries, who have now won just one of their past nine league games, lost striker Callum Wilson to a season-ending knee injury. \n\"Jack was just feeling his ankle,\" said boss Eddie Howe. \"I don't think there's a major injury there but he couldn't move freely and there was pain in his ankle so we took him off. \n\"We will wait and see on Simon - he is feeling his hamstring again. He went to make a pass and felt it, as he had last time [at Everton].\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:15:03.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
