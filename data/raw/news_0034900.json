Michigan Department of Corrections Gregory Green killed his pregnant wife in 1991 and his two daughters and two stepdaughters in 2016. \nA Michigan man who served 16 years behind bars for the murder of his first family has pleaded guilty to torturing his second wife and killing four children. \nGregory Green, 50, entered his plea in Dearborn Heights District Court on Wednesday, after he was found competent to stand trial. His attorney, Charles Longstreet II, had earlier filed a notice of intent to assert the insanity defense. \nProsecutors said Green will face a possible 45 to 100 years in prison when he is sentenced in March. \n“He wanted to get it over with,” Longstreet told reporters after the hearing, according to The Associated Press . \nGreen’s guilty plea comes roughly 24 years after he admitted responsibility in court for the stabbing deaths of his first wife and unborn child, police said. In that case, he pleaded no contest to second-degree murder. He was paroled eight years ago. \nGreen committed his latest crimes at his Dearborn Heights residence on Sept. 28, 2016. Court records state that he killed his two daughters — 4-year-old Kaleigh and 5-year-old Koi — by poisoning them with carbon monoxide fumes. \n“They were asphyxiated in a car with a makeshift tailpipe hose that was redirected into the vehicle,” Dearborn Heights Police Lt. Michael Krause told the Detroit Free Press in September. \nGreen’s two stepdaughters ― 19-year-old Chadney Allen and 17-year-old Kara Allen — were fatally shot. The teens were killed in front of their mother, 49-year-old Faith Green, who was forced to watch, according to the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office. @blacktransvet @CrewdAwakening @WNCrusader @LGBTFORTRUMP Gregory Green - murdered prego wife in 91, remarried & murdered 4 children (2 step) pic.twitter.com/ylahhOBgN3 — Hailey (@MissTexann) February 5, 2017 \nAuthorities were summoned to the scene when Gregory Green called 911. He reportedly told the operator that he’d killed his entire family. However, when investigators arrived on the scene, they discovered that Faith Green had survived being shot and attacked with a box cutter. \n“All of this seems to have stemmed from a domestic violence related incident,” Dearborn Heights Police Capt. Michael Petri said at a September press conference . \nCourt records indicate Faith Green was in the process of divorcing her husband. — Nicole (@LadyJustice2188) February 15, 2017 \nAuthorities said the 911 call this past fall was eerily similar to one that Gregory Green placed on July 14, 1991, in which he confessed to killing his then-wife Tonya Green. At the time, she was seven months pregnant with their child. Authorities said she was stabbed nearly a dozen times with a steak knife. \nAccording to The Detroit News , Gregory Green was denied parole four times in his first wife’s death, with the board citing a lack of empathy and remorse. He was finally paroled in 2008 and two years later married his second wife. \nGreen likely won’t live to see another parole hearing. Per the terms of his plea agreement, he will not be eligible for parole until he is 97 years old, \n“The plea was given with the express approval of Faith Green, the mother of the children, and the father of the two Allen children,” Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy’s office said, according to MLive.com . \nDavid Lohr covers crime and missing persons.
