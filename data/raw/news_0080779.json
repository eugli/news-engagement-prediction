Slot to Miami (FL) Links \nMark Richt has landed a pledge from his next quarterback. \nIMG Academy's Artur Sitkowski gave a verbal commitment to Miami on Saturday while in town for an unofficial visit. \nThe Top247 quarterback, who started his prep career in New Jersey, picked the Hurricanes over LSU, UCLA, Florida, Wisconsin, Rutgers and a number of other elite schools. \n\"I like Miami a lot,\" Sitowski told InsideTheU last week. \"I want to play with some big-time guys. They've got a good quarterback situation there, I can compete early.\" \nSitkowski is ranked by 247Sports as the nation's No. 5 pro-style quarterback. He gives Richt & Co. a quarterback with plenty of arm and one that can also make plays on the ground. \n“Miami is a great program. I love Miami. What [Mark Richt] bringing there is tremendous. He has a great track record of coaching quarterbacks. The biggest thing that sticks out to me. Everywhere he’s went he’s stayed there. He was at Georgia for 15 years. He was at FSU for 15 years. Everywhere he’s went he’s stayed loyal to that program.” \nSitkowski (6-5, 215) threw for 1,216 yards and six touchdowns this past season at Old Bridge (N.J.) High. He had 16 passing touchdowns to his credit as a sophomore and racked up 1,425 passing yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:30:55.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
