AP With technological advancement making human workers more expendable each day, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates wants to somehow regulate the inevitable rise of the machines. The tech mogul, as per Forbes, reportedlywants to impose tax to robot workers in order to offset the impending job losses. By doing so, corporations or even the government could fund training for positions where humans are still needed, including child and senior care. Despite its many potential loop holes—including the probable scenario of worker robots becoming unreasonably expensive—Gates is convinced that taxation is key to making the transition more feasible for human workers. ADVERTISEMENT More so, the Windows godfather is also convinced that government should be “figuring [policy] out” to further prepare the sudden avalanche of unemployed workers. His suggested initiative, however, was already rejected by the European Parliament, which is reportedly focusing on crafting regulations and establishing ethics when it comes to deploying robots.
