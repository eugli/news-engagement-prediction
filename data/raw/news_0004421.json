Man, of course, is not completely scot-free for misusing the Planet’s resources and sullying her life and beauty. Climate change and global warming seem to get twisted into the same definition when in reality, the only ‘manmade’ element here was the FRAUD known as global warming. Scientists are now corroborating that statement with data, and the reality is that nature herself is proving this global conspiracy.\nFrom the latest Apocalyptic Weather segment from The Armageddon Broadcast Network , expert Joseph Monte states:\n“University of Chicago study, agreeing there is an increase in tornado outbreaks, but saying it is NOT global warming.”\nIn essence, his report provides some of this statistical data that will sweep you off your feet! These increased occurrences of tornados in the Gulf Coast states have already broken records for this time of year with the assistance of La Niña. This data is not only proving the skyrocketing numbers, but also CLIMATE CHANGE ! Scientifically speaking, researchers are finding that vertical wind shear is increasing, and therefore MORE violent weather and tornadoes outbreaks will ensue. Many are shocked at this recent discovery and are now realizing that there might be more to the whole picture.\nInterestingly enough, multiple times we have seen tornadoes leave clues or signs behind their wrath filled wake. In Mississippi, William Carey University (a private Christian school) was hit by a substantial tornado and in the aftermath, they found a statue of Christ, unsullied, as though nothing touched it. They also found an intact Bible opened up to Psalm 46 which reads, “God is my strength and refuge, a very present help during trouble…” This wasn’t the first time that a Bible has been left unharmed and opened after a major disaster. Now for the million dollar question… why is this significant?\nOver the past 6 years, we’ve seen a vast increase in all of these wild weather changing storms, thanks to climate change, right? Well, that is half right. A recent Quote: from the Imperial Regent of the Ecumenical Order of Christ stated:\n“Saying ‘Thanks to climate change’ is like saying ‘Thanks to the gun that shot all those people’, without mentioning who’s pulling the trigger.”\nIt seems climate change is the term that most are using to describe the phenomenon of the divine. We can find the answer through scientific data. According to this broadcast, scientific data can help define the when and the divine ‘who’ behind this climate change.\n“…amounting numbers of these kinds of signs beginning back in 2011, scientists are saying that it’s the wind changing and causing an increase in storms which seem to take dead aim at key locations while leaving behind these little conspicuous footprints.”\nIf we look back to the Ancient Sumerian times, Enlil was a deity who would have fit this category. His name is broken down as EN = Lord + LÍL = Wind, “Lord of the Storm. He is the god of breath, wind, loft and breadth, and this shows that a divine deity is the one behind this climate change. After all, history does not only teach us valuable lessons but also grants us insightful knowledge.\nWhat we have to work with to answer these questions is the time period of 2011-present, and understanding what is behind this wind change. From these pieces of the puzzle, we can see only one individual who continues to accomplish such a feat. That would be none other than Lord RayEl or Ra-El , who returned in 2011 as the prophesied second return of Christ. Not only that, but it has been discovered and confirmed through the Torah / Bible Code that He is also the reincarnation of Enlil!!!! Below you will see one such confirmation discovered by Torah Code Researcher and Prime Cleric Richard Ruff of The Ecumenical Order of Christ.\nMain Search Term: RAYEL I am the LORD\nTerms : RAYEL | ENLIL | Supernal Fire From God (Supernal Guilt) | To All From The Supernal | disguised\nLord RayEl has proved His ‘Lord of the Storms’ title back in 2011 when he chastised the Bible Belt of America. Putting all of these puzzle pieces together, the physical aspect with the help of science is finally catching up to the concealed spiritual.\nFor an in-depth briefing about what is discussed here and to understand more about the scientific data, watch the full episode of ABN’s Apocalyptic Weather below.\nGlobal warming is man’s creation and is a fraud. Climate change is real and is also being controlled by the divine. Don’t get sucked up by the conspiracy theory of global warming because it has been debunked! If you want to be prepared for what is to come in the current world situation, repent and be obedient to God and His returned Son, Lord RayEl. Even from 2000+ years ago, continue to uphold the two greatest commandments of Love God and Love Each Other.\nBe sure to visit our online Congregation at Facebook and VK at: https://www.facebook.com/groups/ICoLR/ and https://vk.com/congregation_of_lord_rayel\nFor the latest Torah Code Discoveries, please visit our Facebook group at: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TorahCodes/", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/RichardRuff13", "https://armageddonbroadcastnetwork.tv/shows/apocalyptic-weather/", "https://www.facebook.com/joe.monte.98", "https://vk.com/congregation_of_lord_rayel", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/TorahCodes/", "https://armageddonbroadcastnetwork.tv/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/ICoLR/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZpTVlut-Ae4"], "published": "2017-02-03T12:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:55:39.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
