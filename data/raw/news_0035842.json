Quade Cooper copped plenty of flak for fighting Jack McInnes. Source: AAP \n“Quade Cooper is a terrific boxer but he only wants to throw punches,’’ said King, who shows no signs of slowing down at 39. \n“Because of his rugby he won’t risk anything happening to his legs. \n“I really think he has the potential to be a champion boxer. He loves it. If I could train him in boxing for a year straight he would beat anyone in the country at 90kg. \nINEXPERIENCE: Cooper admits he’s still green as a fighter \n“He’s going to train with me all through the rugby season and we’ve seen in the past when Quade does a lot of boxing training the fitness and the discipline really makes him perform well on the field.’’ \nKing, who won the Australian 70kg boxing title in 2013 and lost it in the Channel 9 thriller against Rocky Jerkic, said he had introduced tag-team kickboxing as a way of keeping his first sport fresh and exciting. Cooper lands a stiff jab on McInnes.

King wants to step up the level of competition after a break in Cooper’s rugby commitments at the end of the season.
