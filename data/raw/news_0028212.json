PUBLISHED: 04:58, Tue, Feb 14, 2017 | UPDATED: 05:19, Tue, Feb 14, 2017 GETTY Russian scientists made a big discovery in the Iranian desert The team managed to collect a sufficient number of extraterrestrial materials Viktor Grokhovsky, head of the expedition \nViktor Grokhovsky, head of the expedition, became widely known around the world when his team became the first to discover and study the remains of the Chelyabinsk meteor which entered Earth’s atmosphere on February 15, 2013. He said: “The team managed to collect a sufficient number of extraterrestrial materials, with the support of their Iranian colleagues from the University of Kerman.” Related articles 'Secret base for man-eating aliens being built' US records show \nThe trial expedition to the Iranian desert was conducted by four employees for a laboratory named the Extra Terra Consortium. Grokhovsky added: “During the field work, about 13 kilograms of the samples, which is considered to be meteorite, were found. \n“Half of the found fragments have remained with our Iranian colleagues; the other half has arrived at our test lab. For now the samples have been measured and entered into the catalogue.”“In order to determine the age of the found fragments, the scientist should consider when a fragment was formed in space, when it split from its parent body and how much time has it spent on Earth.” GETTY Russia has previously been hit by meteorites that have caused serious damage \nThe scientist has estimated the meteoritic matter is the same age as our solar system, about 4.5 billion years old.The conditions in the desert are thought to have created a unique environment for the preservation of meteorite material. SECRETS of Area 51 Mon, July 25, 2016 The United States Air Force facility, known as Area 51 is a remote area in Nevada. Current purpose of the base is unknown, however conspiracy theorists and media have speculated purposes from UFO spacecraft research to analysing the brain activity of an alien. Getty 1 of 10 ‘Roadrunners Internationale’ was a group inside Area 51 where employees met to discuss life at Area 51, even though much of what they discussed was classified \nHe concluded: “We will put forward a task in which we will determine for how long the meteorite fragments have been on Earth. “Based on the isotopes it will be possible to talk about cosmogonist age, that is, how long the outer body of the meteorite was in the form of an asteroid. Ahead lays great and difficult work.”Iranian university students helped with the discovery and it is hoped they will aid the analysis of the material.
