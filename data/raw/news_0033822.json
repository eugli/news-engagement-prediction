Netflix cheating has increased threefold since the behavior was first surveyed in 2013, and 60% of today’s consumers said they would cheat even more if they felt they could get away with it. To make matters worse, 81% of cheaters are repeat offenders, and 44% have committed the act at least three or more times. \nSo what shows are enticing people to commit such a heinous crime? The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, American Horror Story, House of Cards, Orange Is The New Black, Narcos, and Stranger Things were among the top temptations. The data suggests that there is some level of guilt associated with the behavior. The study found that 80% of respondents said their cheating was unplanned, and two-thirds (66%) said they cheated because “the shows are just so good” that they could not stop themselves from binge-watching. \nNearly half — 45% of respondents — said they have never admitted to cheating and 46% judged the behavior as “not bad at all.” \nNetflix detailed the findings in an infographic. \nNetflix’s study was conducted by SurveyMonkey from Dec. 20-31, 2016 and was based on 30,267 total responses. The streaming company said the survey was “balanced by age and gender” and “representative of an adult online population who watch TV shows via streaming services as a couple” in various countries throughout the world.
