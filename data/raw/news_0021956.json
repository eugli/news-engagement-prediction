It is the second time in two years that Vladimir Kara-Murza, 35, has been hospitalized in grave condition, and his wife, Evgenia, claims the Kremlin is to blame. \"The Russian government and President Putin are responsible for what happened to my husband two years ago, and now, one way or another, I'm not saying that they're the ones who did that, but they've created such a climate in our country, that actually encourages this kind of behavior,\" Evgenia said. CNN cannot independently confirm her claims, and Russia has denied any connection to Kara-Murza's illness. \"It's pure nonsense to make any connection of this unfortunate case with President Putin,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN. Kara-Murza with his wife, Evgenia, and their three children. Read More Doctors in the hospital where Kara-Murza is being treated say they still \"have no real idea\" what caused his illness, but agree that it was triggered by a \"toxic substance,\" his lawyer Vadim Prokhorov told CNN. He said he has no direct proof his client was poisoned. Doctors have diagnosed Kara-Murza with \"acute intoxication by an unidentified substance,\" Evgenia said, adding that the risks are now more serious due to his previous illness in 2015. Kara-Murza is still too weak and ill to speak, but has been communicating by blinking his eyes, Evgenia said. As of Thursday, he began breathing on his own. Evgenia 'terrified' every time husband returns to Russia Kara-Murza with his family. Kara-Murza, who lives with his wife and three children in Virginia part-time, was in Russia to promote a documentary on the assassination of his late friend, the former leading opposition figure Boris Nemtsov. Nemtsov was shot to death on a bridge near the Kremlin as he walked home from a restaurant in February 2015. Kara-Murza became ill four months later. Evgenia told CNN that she is \"absolutely terrified\" every time her husband goes back to Russia to do opposition work, but that he is a \"Russian patriot\" committed to his cause. Deputy leader of the Freedom Party, Kara-Murza is also part of the Open Russia foundation, an organization of anti-Putin activists who call for open elections, a free press and civil rights reforms.
