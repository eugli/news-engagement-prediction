What we want isn’t support to continue, but rather support to end this work,” Saleh said. \nThe film focuses on Syrian first-responders, rescue workers who risk their lives to save Syrians affected by the civil war, now in its sixth year. The film often captures the highly dangerous moments when the White Helmets arrive at the scene of an airstrike, which may be imminently bombed for a second time in a so-called “double tap” attacks. \nMany of the group’s members have been killed by Syrian President Bashar Assad’s war planes. The volunteers’ struggle to reach those bombed in the rebel enclave of eastern Aleppo, just before the city completely fell to the government forces in December, was especially poignant. The group also was nominated for last year’s Nobel Peace Prize. \nREAD MORE: Bashar al-Assad: Donald Trump’s travel ban is ‘not against the Syrian people’ \nDirector Orlando von Einsiedel and producer Joanna Natasegara accepted the Oscar, but devoted most of their short time on stage to sharing a statement from the absent Khaled Khateeb. \n“We’re so grateful that this film has highlighted our work to the world,” said the statement, read by von Einsiedel. \nKhateb told The Associated Press on Monday from Turkey that though he said he had expected the documentary to win, he didn’t sleep all night but smoked shisha with friends and watching the ceremony. \n“It is a media prize, it’s not a political prize … But still it sheds light on the tragedy of the Syrian people. Maybe it will help stop some of the massacres,” he added. “It is a strong movie.” \nKhateeb was scheduled to arrive on Saturday in Los Angeles on a Turkish Airlines flight departing from Istanbul. \nREAD MORE: Syrian White Helmets share ‘Alternative Nobel’ along with 3 others \nHis plans were upended after U.S. officials reported finding “derogatory information” regarding Khateeb. According to internal Trump administration correspondence seen by The Associated Press, the Department of Homeland Security decided at the last minute to block him from travelling to Los Angeles for the Oscars. \n“I tried and it didn’t work,” Khateeb said of his hopes to attend the ceremony. “It is America’s loss!” \n— \nAssociated Press writer Lindsey Bahr in Los Angeles contributed to this report.
