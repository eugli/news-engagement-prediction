Highlights Call centre employee withdraws Rs 8000 from SBI ATM at Sangam Vihar. 2 The ATM dispensed four fake Rs 2000 notes. 3 FIR lodged, further probe is on in the February 6 incident. \nIn what can be certainly termed as a major security breach, a State Bank of India ATM at South Delhi's Sangam Vihar dispensed fake Rs 2000 notes. The pink coloured notes could be easily passed off as original until some of the glaring differences are noticed. \nThe notes mention 'Children Bank of India' in place of Reserve Bank of India and 'Guaranteed by the Children's Government' in place of Guaranteed by the Central Government. The fake notes had 'churan lable' in place of the latent image and a 'PK' logo at the lower half where bank's seal is seen in the original currency note. The content of the fake note clearly points towards some kind of prank. \nAccording to reports, On February 6, a call centre employee withdrew Rs 8000 from the SBI ATM at Sangam Vihar. He later realised that all the four notes that the ATM dispensed were fake. He immediately approached the police station nearby to report the matter. \nA cop went to the ATM and withdrew a note himself to verify the complaint and to his surprise the note confirmed the allegation. \nAn FIR has been registered in the matter and further probe is on. \nALSO READ: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:24:53.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
