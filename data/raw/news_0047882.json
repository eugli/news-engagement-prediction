Now we've got a lot of research to do so we know what to do after November 20.\" \nGuy said the latest science information showed shellfish in the Kaikoura area had been badly impacted by the 7.8-magnitude earthquake, with 20 per cent of adult paua habitat being affected and an even greater impact on the juvenile paua habitat. \n\"While some may be disappointed, I believe people understand the need to rebuild this fishery for the long term. We need to give the remaining adult paua and shellfish beds time to spawn, and the juveniles a chance to settle.\" \nThe ministry would be working to develop a robust science package to estimate the impacts and provide sound advice for future management decisions, Guy said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:06:29.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
