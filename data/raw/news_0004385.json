Editor \nThis is one of the reasons why Singaporeans despite having good experience and qualifications were unemployed. It's because of their mindset, they can choose to be late than to pay more to get to their appointment or work in time, if not all will take MC. Then they will start to complain when they were being sacked by employers, I seriously find that it's a great embarrassment that Singaporeans are behaving like this and then keep on complaining that employers are turning to foreigners. Advertisement \nForeigners on the other hand know that work and appointments are very important and they will try by all their means and will to be on times and are willing to work longer and extra hours instead of taking MC, this is what employers want. \nNow Singaporeans, please wake up to your plight, if you continue to behave in this manner, then I am very sorry that you will not find jobs anywhere you go. And also, stop rushing and driving recklessly on the roads and when being asked why are you driving recklessly, you say that if you don't rush to work on time, a foreigner will always be ready to take over you, you ask for it so you deserve it, set off earlier and sometimes if you know you are late, just pay more to get to work or appointments. \nEditors, please make this viral, I want Singaporeans to wake up their idea rather than to continue behaving like this. \nAnson \nA.S.S.
