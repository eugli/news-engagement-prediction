And it’s HTC first out of the gate with a bevy of Vive updates—mostly concerning developers, but at least one very important new program for consumers.\nLet’s start with the latter, as it’s perhaps the biggest Vive news:\n“For the first time, Vive is launching a financing program in North America. For $66 a month and no-interest financing for 12 months, users can purchase a Vive on Vive.com with zero down. Additional new financing options are available at varying finance terms.”\nThe Vive’s sticking to its $799 price, so this is unlikely to offset the “VR is too expensive” complaints. It does potentially make VR a bit more “affordable” though, spreading the burden out over the course of a year like a cell phone and/or car payment instead of requiring one large up-front sum.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T15:57:00.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
