We were at a queer rights rally and I saw how much the queer community needed a lot of support.” ID: 10559967 View this image › “I was happily married and it was 16 years into my marriage when my partner told me that she was transgendered. That was a bit of a shock. We then went through a transition period of Penny working out that she was gonna transition and that she was gonna be Penny. During that time, we were out dancing and I looked at Penny and I thought ‘I really still love her and gee, I think she’s attractive’. It was this realisation that we could continue to be married, that we still loved each other and that we were gonna be happily married ever after.” ID: 10559959 View this image › “When I was in Year 12, I was at the shops with a girl who’s Persian and very religious. We were friends previously, but suddenly she cut me dead. She said, ‘You know there’s a reason why I can’t talk to you’, and walked away. I just stood there flummoxed. That’s when I realised that just being out or not wasn’t really the thing, but saying that I was a lesbian to people suddenly meant some people will cut me off or some people will be my friends.” ID: 10559930 View this image › “The first time I realised it mattered was last year when I went to the mardi gras parade for the first time. I grew up in Canberra which has a great queer community but not really huge pride events like Mardi Gras. I saw hundreds and thousands of people celebrating their identity and realised there is a community that genuinely cares. I got really emotional standing there as a little 17-year-old. I didn’t know anyone but I felt at home.” ID: 10559964 View this image › “I was in a very privileged position where I could’ve come out earlier but I was waiting until I was truly comfortable with my identity before I did. I’ve been open about my sexuality for three and a half years now.” ID: 10559943 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:20:46.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
