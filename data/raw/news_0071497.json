Those funds will aid families affected by the disaster, which has been dubbed the area’s worst flood in a century and prompted a mandatory evacuation order for 14,000 San Jose residents. \nThe Quakes Foundation organized a fundraiser that drew contributions of $14,830 from the general public. The Earthquakes matched that amount, and then after the A’s donated $10,000, contributed the final $340 to bring the grand total to an even $40K. Donations can still be made by visiting www.Quakes74.gesture.com or by texting QUAKES74 to 52182. \nThe two-time MLS Cup champions also hosted evacuees at their preseason scrimmage vs. Sacramento Republic FC at Avaya Stadium on Saturday, offering free tickets and transportation to the match, a 4-1 win for San Jose. \nThe Quakes open their 2017 regular season with a home game against the Montreal Impact on Saturday (10 pm ET; TVAS/TSN1/TSN4/TSN5 in Canada, MLS LIVE in US).
