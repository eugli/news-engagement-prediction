Credit Sharon Radisch for The New York Times I walk into the new Acne Studios store all wet, winter rain running down my coat and shoes, and see there are already puddles all over the floor. Little mottled blue rugs by the British designer Max Lamb look like soft pools; I would gladly fall into one. Even when soaked, it’s impossible to stand in an Acne store and not feel as though the design is embracing you, even forgiving you. Jonny Johansson, the company’s founder and creative director, has said that he sometimes regrets the name Acne, an acronym of Ambition to Create Novel Expression. The brand was first a creative collective, founded in 1997, and has grown into the world’s primary Scandinavian fashion export (not counting H&M, of course). Swedish interiors bring to mind the smoothest possible surfaces: unblemished. Everyday objects — things — are simple, functional and just. In 2013, Lynn Yaeger accurately described the brand in The Wall Street Journal, saying, “Its legions of fans think of it as a brand with integrity, a company that makes principled aesthetic decisions and never resorts to marketing tricks, even though they have hundreds of outlets.” Photo A shopping space with clean lines and airy interiors. Credit Sharon Radisch for The New York Times In the United States, Scandinavian design is aspirational and everywhere. And it’s not just Ikea’s influence. There is something about clean lines, airy interiors, white walls and simple, wooden furniture that, outside of Sweden, where its practicality and function represents the principles of social democracy, feels elitist. Here, minimalism as aesthetic is not at all about having very little. It’s about showcasing that you can carefully choose what not to have. In this exhibition of not much, design can be intoxicating. But there is more fun to be had at Acne than “just right” jeans and leather jackets (the label’s stalwarts) to place in a room with white walls and a single, sanctimonious fig tree. Like ill-fitting cargo pants. “They’re supposed to look like they don’t fit you,” the saleswoman assures me when I try on an awkward drawstring pair ($650). She’s wearing them, too; they don’t fit her either. Photo Jackets and accessories. Credit Sharon Radisch for The New York Times Acne store interiors are grand, and yet completely stark. Anytime I enter one, I wish I was somebody’s sson. The walls in this new store are gold-colored aluminum, the floors are set with tiny black pebbles, flecked with blue lapis and pale coral. In this space, I am a blissful goldfish: I can’t remember if I ever lived outside the glass wall in front of me, and I’m content to do circles here for eternity. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story I take in a dusty lilac coat, hung on a brass rail with a scarf of the same color. Wait, no, the scarf is a different color. Is it? I bring the scarf close to my face, my eyelashes pet it. There are flecks of gray just barely woven in. Are there? I consult the tags. The color is Chalky Lilac Mélange ($1,150); the scarf is simply Lilac Mélange. Attention well used.
