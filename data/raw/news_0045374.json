Analysis Image copyright PA \nBy Ben Wright, political correspondent \nPeers will not block Brexit. But nor are they likely to wave this bill through without asking the Commons to think again about a number of issues. \nPeers are certainly keen to have their say in this week's two-day debate. \nThe committee stage scrutiny - and possible votes - will come the week after. \nAnd with many non-party cross-benchers in the picture the government cannot be certain of defeating all the changes peers will be pushing for. That would mean the Commons could have to consider the bill again. \nHowever, there is no sign the unelected Lords want to go into battle with MPs and the government over Brexit - or meddle with the referendum's mandate. \nLabour has said it will not frustrate Theresa May's plan to trigger the start of Brexit by the end of next month. \nThe list of likely speakers includes former chancellors Lord Lawson, Lord Lamont and Lord Darling, former foreign secretaries Lord Hague and Lord Owen and former Cabinet Secretaries Lord O'Donnell, Lord Butler and Lord Armstrong. \nOthers expected to contribute include former UKIP leader Lord Pearson and Lord Pannick, the QC who led the successful legal challenge against the government, culminating in the Supreme Court ruling that the prior approval of Parliament was needed before Article 50 was invoked. \nDetailed scrutiny of the bill at committee stage is due to take place on 27 February and 1 March. If the bill is not amended, then it could theoretically be approved by the Lords at Third Reading on 7 March, becoming law shortly afterwards. \nIf peers do make changes to the bill, it would put them on a collision course with MPs - who overwhelmingly passed the bill unaltered and would be expected to overturn any Lords amendments. 'Simple bill' \nSpeaking on Sunday, former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson urged peers to show \"courage\" and not wave the bills through without debate. \nJustice Secretary Liz Truss said she expected the unelected second chamber to respect the \"will of the people\" expressed in last year's referendum. Media caption Truss: I expect Lords to pass Brexit bill \nBut Lord Hain, a former Northern Ireland Secretary, maintains he has a mandate to seek changes despite being an unelected peer. \nHe said: \"I was appointed by my party. And in the referendum, two thirds of Labour electors voted to Remain. I don't deny they won, or that the outcome has to be respected. But what about the 48% who voted Remain?\" \nAlthough the Conservatives have the largest number of peers in the Lords, with 252 members, they are vulnerable to being outvoted if opposition peers - including 202 Labour peers and 102 Lib Dems - join forces. \nMuch will hinge of the actions of the 178 crossbenchers in the Lords - who are not aligned to any party and do not take a party whip. \nOnce Article 50 is invoked, there will be up to two years of talks on the terms of the UK's departure and its future relationship with the EU unless all 28 member states agree to extend the deadline.
