The last 10 years of David Hockney: from oil and canvas to iPad drawings – in pictures Read more \nHockney, 79, said he was delighted to have been asked to add his flair to the newspaper’s red and white banner as a life-long fan of the publication. \nThe redesigned masthead is strongly reminiscent of the original logo – the white title against a red background – but will now include Hockney’s hand-drawn sun and its rays. \nHe said: “Once I thought about the idea, it didn’t take me long. The sun and the Sun. I love it.” \nThe painter of A Bigger Splash utilised modern technology to create the design, opting to use a painting app on a tablet and drawing it with his thumb. \nThe Sun’s editor-in-chief, Tony Gallagher, said: “Nothing demonstrates the enduring position of the Sun in British culture like having Britain’s most-loved living artist redesign our logo. \n“We’re immensely proud that we can offer Sun readers their own David Hockney, and incredibly grateful that he chose our newspaper.” \nThe Hockney edition of the newspaper, which will also feature an interview with the artist, is printed days before the opening of his biggest-ever exhibition at Tate Britain on Thursday 9 February. \nFans of Hockney, who is considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, will be able to see more than 250 pieces of artwork, from his earlier pop art pictures to newer paintings in ultra-bright colours completed in 2016. \nThe Sun design will also be on display at the exhibition, along with other works created on an iPhone or tablet.
