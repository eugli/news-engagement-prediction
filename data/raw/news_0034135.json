There was just one important person missing from the guest list: his new bae, Selena Gomez.\nAccording to TMZ , Selena had to skip the festivities, at Dave & Buster's in Hollywood (The Weeknd's fave spot ), because she was flying to the opposite side of the country to sit front row at New York Fashion Week.\n But Sel wasn't going to let something like a few thousand miles stop her from ensuring her man had the best time ever.\nHow? By picking up the entire tab.\nThe \"Starboy\" singer's guests reportedly included French Montana, 2 Chainz, Big Sean and Travis Scott. Sources who attended told TMZ that the group enjoyed unlimited beverages and games â€” and had the place to themselves from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m.\nThe bill for the evening came to about $30,000, TMZ reports. So basically, Selena sponsored the event. I don't know how anyone could blow that much cash on Dance Dance Revolution, but whatever! I won't ask questions.\nFor what it's worth, The Weeknd and Sel probably aren't hurting for quality time together. Steamy pics that just hit the web show Seleeknd majorly PDA-ing on a yacht last Saturday.\nThese two seem super-committed to making their relationship work despite their hectic schedules.\nFrom: Seventeen\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/celebrity-couples/news/a45130/selena-gomez-weeknd-30k-birthday-party/", "http://www.tmz.com/2017/02/14/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-surprise-birthday-party/", "http://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Selena-Gomez-Weeknd-Kissing-Yacht-February-2017-43169515#photo-43169516", "http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/celebrity-couples/news/a44658/selena-gomez-spotted-holding-hands-with-the-weeknd-on-a-date/"], "published": "2017-02-16T12:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:25:22.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
