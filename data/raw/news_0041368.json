Theo Walcott left red-faced as Arsenal fans slam club for 'disrespectful' gesture \nNeither side has any hope of European qualification this season and faces little threat of a relegation scrap. \nThe 41-year-old is considered one of the best referees in the world – having officiated the Euro 2016 final, last season’s Champions League final and the FA Cup final. There’s hardly anything riding on West Brom vs Bournemouth (Getty Images) \nBut he revealed last week that he is off to become the new head of referees in Saudi Arabia. \nIt is believed he had grown increasingly frustrated over a perceived lack of support from the Premier League’s refereeing body Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL). Next weekend's Premier League fixtures \nSaturday \nCrystal Palace v Middlesbrough (15:00) \nEverton v Sunderland (15:00) \nWest Brom v Bournemouth (15:00) \nWatford v West Ham (17:30) \nSunday \nTottenham v Stoke City (13:30) \nMonday \nLeicester City v Liverpool (20:00) \nIn a press conference in the Middle Eastern kingdom last week, Clattenburg said: ‘This is an important move forward. We have professional referees in the country that I am leaving, which has been a big positive. \n‘One thing I’d like to do is work with the refereeing team and the president to make this happen so that it will be successful for many, many years to come.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:36:56.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
