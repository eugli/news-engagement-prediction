Another senior editor at the publication told Washingtonian Monday that “at least a half dozen” employees are prepared to leave the organization because of remarks Yiannopoulos made about pedophilia that gained attention this weekend. “The fact of the matter is that there’s been so many things that have been objectionable about Milo over the last couple of years, quite frankly. This is something far more sinister,” the senior editor said. “If the company isn’t willing to act, there are at least half a dozen people who are willing to walk out over it” Yiannopoulos was supposed to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) this week, but his invitation to speak was rescinded on Monday. \n\n\n\nOh so free speech just doesn’t exist anymore? We’re trying to silence people just because we disagree with them? Doesn’t seem very American to me. Breitbart is now no different than those libtard colleges like NYU, Villanova, and Miami that cancelled Milo’s appearances to give speeches. CPAC is the same, Simon & Schuster too. They’re all a bunch of safe space wanters. \n\nGuess what, you cucks, you can’t put duct tape over someone’s mouth just because you don’t like the words that are coming out. That’s not the America I grew up in. So Milo has some controversial views, big deal, sorry if everything in the world doesn’t fit in your little bubble. Sorry if you’ve got to deal with opinions that aren’t your own in reality. You stuck with Milo when he wanted to deport all Islamic people, you stuck by him when he was a run of the mill sexist and bigot. Stand by your mans now, all he did was advocate for a little pedophilia and priest molestation. Some may say that it’s nice to find out you have a line somewhere but I say you’re a libtard snowflake cuck safe spacer. \n\nPS – I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again: if you’re a gay dude, a hot blonde, or a black guy then you are a FOOL for not selling your soul and just spouting nonsense in order to get rich. Everyone over there looks like every white person’s grandfather and they’re just dying to have a black person or a gay dude take their side so they can say, “See! This person gets it! Why can’t the rest of you!?” Feitelberg |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:08:56.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
