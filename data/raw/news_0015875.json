Lakers Coach Luke Walton talks to point guard D'Angelo Russell (1) during the first half of a game against the New York Knicks on Feb. 6. (Frank Franklin II / Associated Press) Tania Ganguli casually sauntered through a tunnel made up of teammates as the public address announcer at Madison Square Garden called his name before the game.\nNo matter to the rookie that this was an important moment in his young career, that he was taking this step in one of the NBA ’s most iconic buildings. Before the game, he betrayed none of the nervous energy surely fluttering within him. \nThat came later. \nThe Lakers (18-36) are turning toward their future. In their 121-107 win over the New York Knicks , Lakers Coach Luke Walton sat the team’s two marquee free agents, Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov , starting Ingram at small forward for Deng and Tarik Black at center for Mozgov. Together the two benched players have contracts worth $136 million. \nWalton stressed he guarantees nothing for this young starting lineup, but Ingram, Black, Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell and Nick Young are the Lakers starters until further notice. Ingram played 32 minutes and scored 14 points with seven rebounds and two assists. Black scored nine points with 10 rebounds and Lou Williams led the Lakers with 22 points off the bench. Carmelo Anthony had a game-high 26 points for the Knicks. \n“It always comes back to what I think is best for the team,” Walton said. “Not only right at this moment, but the future of the team. We try to make our decisions based on that, not on the salaries.” \nBefore pulling the trigger on the change, Walton had conversations with Lakers executive vice president of basketball operations Jim Buss and general manager Mitch Kupchak . Under their guidance, the Lakers signed Mozgov to a four-year, $64 million contract this offseason and Deng to a four-year, $72 million contract, and also drafted Ingram second overall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:55:39.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
