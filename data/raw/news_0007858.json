Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,' he added.\nBillionaire Travis Kalanick, chief executive officer of Uber Technologies, has informed President Trump that he is leaving his advisory council\nRecode reported his departure and published the email.\n'The implicit assumption that Uber (or I) was somehow endorsing the Administration's agenda has created a perception-reality gap between who people think we are, and who we actually are, Kalanick continued.\n'We must believe that the actions we take ultimately move the ball forward. There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that,' he wrote. 'The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America. Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there's a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.'\n'We will fight for the rights of immigrants in our communities so that each of us can be who we are with optimism and hope for the future,' he concluded.\nAn Online petition called for his immediate resignation from the council. 'As a company whose success is built on a foundation of hard work by immigrant workers, Uber can and should do better to stand up for immigrants,' it said.\nUber drew fury from protesters who had been angered by Trump's immigration order, which halted immigration from 7 Muslim-majority countries.\nUber CEO Travis Kalanick attends the 'Technology Tipping Points: Digital Ubiquity' session of 2016 Summer Davos Forum on June 26, 2016 in Tianjin, China\nPresident Donald Trump is convening his business advisory council on Friday\nNew York taxicab drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves, launched a one-hour work stoppage last Saturday in solidarity with protesters at New York's JFK airport.\nUber then responded to the situation by dropping its congestion pricing â€“ a move that some protesters took as undercutting the temporary work stoppage. Rival Lyft responded by making a $1 million donation over four years to the American Civil Liberties.\nLyft CEO Logan Green called the ban 'antithetical to both Lyft's and our nation's core values. We stand firmly against these actions, and will not be silent on issues that threaten the values of our community.'\nThe company maintained that it was just responding to the needs of its users, given the situation. Riders might otherwise have been stranded.", "external_links": ["http://www.recode.net/2017/2/2/14490950/travis-kalanick-uber-ceo-leaves-donald-trump-advisory-council", "https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/tell-uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-should-immediately-resign-from-trumps-advisory-council-over-immigration-ban", "http://www.recode.net/2017/2/2/14490950/travis-kalanick-leaves-trump-advisory-council"], "published": "2017-02-03T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:21:22.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
