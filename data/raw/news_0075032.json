I had no idea they would be able to eat something like that,” Michelle told 9news.com.au .\nPoor possum. Photo: Supplied. Source: Supplied \nThe python is believed to have been approximately 1.4m and it’s not unusual for them to eat things seven times as big as their heads.\nThe “feeding” reportedly took 15 minutes before the giant reptile swallowed the entire possum.\nStay safe, people of Australia.
