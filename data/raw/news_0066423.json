Bukaty/Associated Press/File 2011\nRoxanne Quimby, the founder of Burt&apos;s Bees, through her foundation, donated 87,000 acres to the federal government for the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine&apos;s North Woods.\nBy Associated Press February 23, 2017\nPORTLAND, Maine — The governor has asked Republican President Donald Trump to undo Democratic former President Barack Obama’s designation of a national monument and give back the land that was donated for it.\nRepublican Governor Paul LePage asked Trump to take the unprecedented step of returning land in the northern part of the state to private ownership in a Feb. 14 letter.\nAdvertisement\nBurt’s Bees cofounder Roxanne Quimby’s foundation last August donated 87,000 acres to the federal government for the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine’s North Woods. Burt’s Bees is a personal care products company that calls itself ‘‘Earth friendly’’ and says it has a triple bottom line: people, profit, planet.\nLePage said if the land remains a federal monument the state should manage it to avoid economic damage and protect traditional recreational use of it. He said he hopes Trump will create jobs and ‘‘make the Maine woods great again.’’\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. The monument’s creation was opposed by state lawmakers and critics who said they feared it would hinder efforts to rebuild a forest-based economy in the region. But supporters, including local businesses and environmental groups, have said the appeal of a national monument would help revitalize a struggling though lovely rural area.\nView Story A future for the Katahdin woods of North Central Maine Some in the area, declared a national monument last week, say the move is just another power grab by politicians in Washington.\n‘Is there a more glorious place on earth than this?’\nThe governor said he’s hopeful Trump will heed opponents of the monument in Maine’s Second Congressional District, which sent Trump an electoral college vote in the November election. It was unclear what Trump planned to do, if anything.\nRepublican US Senator Susan Collins said on Wednesday during a Maine Public Radio interview that it’s a ‘‘real legal question’’ whether Trump can undo the designation.\nAdvertisement\n‘‘Towns have started working together to make the best of the situation,’’ she said.\nThe governor, in his letter, said there are those who would say a president can’t ‘‘undo a national monument because it has never been done before.’’\n‘‘They also never envisioned President Trump,’’ LePage said.\nQuimby’s son, Lucas St. Clair, who had previously said he was ‘‘pretty confident’’ Trump wouldn’t get involved, called LePage’s letter disappointing.\n‘‘There’s been great investments happening already, and the economy of the Katahdin region is getting to show positive results from the designation,’’ he said. ‘‘And I think most people are excited and are moving on.’’\nSt. Clair rebuffed LePage’s claim that the national monument limits recreational pursuits and said the national monument has more relaxed rules for snowmobiling and hunting than Baxter State Park does.\nHe said the foundation chose a national monument over a state park because of research showing an increased benefit to rural economies.\n‘‘While I love Maine state parks,’’ he said, ‘‘the governor in his most recent budget decreased the funding for our state parks.’’\nRelated Solitude and adventure in Katahdin Woods and Waters Editorial: For Maine, a gift of the great outdoors", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F22%2Flepage-asks-trump-make-maine-woods-great-again%2FjKaoc0PWe96oaSufDfM0WL%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tLePage", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F22%2Flepage-asks-trump-make-maine-woods-great-again%2FjKaoc0PWe96oaSufDfM0WL%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=LePage", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F22%2Flepage-asks-trump-make-maine-woods-great-again%2FjKaoc0PWe96oaSufDfM0WL%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=LePage", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F22%2Flepage-asks-trump-make-maine-woods-great-again%2FjKaoc0PWe96oaSufDfM0WL%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=LePage"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:55:04.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
