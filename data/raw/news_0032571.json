A forensics tent at the scene of the incident in Bow \nThey said the victim’s death was still being treated as “unexplained”. \nSeveral neighbours said they heard a commotion from the tenth-floor flat before the woman was seen on the ground after falling from a side window. \nOne neighbour said: “I heard a female voice shouting in a very aggressive manner. I also heard a big bang and looked down out of the window and I saw the lady on the ground. \n“The ambulance came very quickly and they were administering CPR but she wasn’t moving and it was obvious she was dead. They covered her in a blanket and tarpaulin.” \nAnother neighbour said: “We just heard a lot of shouting which must have been going on for about five or ten minutes. Someone then went to go and alert the caretaker, but by that point the woman’s body was on the ground. We are all shocked.” \nOther residents described how the woman who lives at the flat rushed into the communal corridor in “hysterics” after the plunge. \nOne said: “The woman who rents the flat where it happened came out and was hysterical, saying that her and the woman [who fell] had been having breakfast together.” \nA Met spokesman said: “We were called at 11.23am on Thursday February 9 to Massey House to reports of a woman fallen from a height. \n“Officers and the London Ambulance Service attended. A woman, believed to be in her 30s, was pronounced dead at the scene. \n“Next of kin have been informed. A woman was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder and taken to an east London police station. \n“At this early stage the death is being treated as unexplained.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T13:53:27.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
