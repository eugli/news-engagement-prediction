Picture: Getty \nLord Mayor Graham Quirk has also warned of Monday morning peak hour chaos as bus and train drivers are taken off the road due to the Sunday night Adele concert. \nCr Quirk said having Adele perform at the Gabba on March 4 and 5 was “absolutely fabulous”, but he criticised the promoters of the event, saying the location “wasn’t clearly thought through”. \n“I want to make it clear that the Sunday night concert presents a very big challenge because drivers under law have to have a 10-hour break,” Cr Quirk said at a media conference today. \n“So you’ve got Monday morning, peak hour, people are going to have a demand to get to work. \n“It’s not just the 60,000 from the stadium, it is the Sunday night backing up with the Monday morning peak that is also a terrific concern. \n“It won’t only affect Brisbane buses, it’s trains, its’ going to affect private bus operators.” \nCr Quirk said 60,000 people leaving the venue at once was “not going to be pretty” and urged concertgoers to be patient. \nOver 40,000 people are expected to pack the south Brisbane stadium seating, with another 20,000 tickets sold for standing room on the grass below the stage for the concert. \n“It will require a significant number of our drivers on the job,” Cr Schrinner said. \n“This is an entirely voluntary event when it comes to our drivers working. We can’t force them to work on this weren’t so we’ve put out the word far and wide to get our drivers to volunteer for this event. They will get paid, obviously, but they can choose not to work on the weekends if they don’t want to.” \nWhile council has not helped organise the event, Cr Schrinner said he was concerned punters weren’t getting the message about travel times from any other organisations involved. \n“We’re working together with TransLink and the Gabba but at this stage I’m yet to see any form of communication plan requested from the Gabba,” Cr Schrinner said. \n“I have requested what their communication plan is and none has been forthcoming at this stage.” Adele and Beyonc�: Respect Among the Divas 5:54 \nAdele came away the big winner at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

Shuttles will leave every 30 seconds on the way back. \nBuses are planned to run every three minutes from Chermside in the north to the Gabba before the show, then every minute on the way out. \nSouthern buses will run every two-and-half minutes from Eight Mile Plains before the show, then every 80 seconds after the show. \nBuses will run every four minutes from an eastern direction at Carindale on the way in, then every 90 seconds on the way out. \n“These types of frequencies you’ve probably guessed are very significant frequencies indeed,” Cr Schrinner said. \nThe Lord Mayor suggested Suncorp Stadium would have been a more appropriate venue for the concerts because it had two train stations nearby as well as its underground bus facility. \n“It is much better place in terms of dispersing than what the Gabba is,” he said. \n“It is one thing for an event management together with a promoter to make an agreement about a concert going ahead, and then they are saying to the public transport providers ‘you go and support it from here’.” \nCr Quirk would not say the upfront cost to the council for providing buses but said it would be reimbursed through TransLink. \n“We are simply an agency giving TransLink support. So they will be buying our services, if you like, for the night,” he said. \nWe have said that we will cooperate to the very best that we can. \n“TransLink are going to be responsible for the arrangements for public transport.” \nA spokeswoman for Stadiums Queensland said staff had been working with with everyone involved to ensure the event was planned properly. \n“As with every event held in Brisbane, all The Gabba’s communications and messaging regarding event transport directs patrons to TransLink,” the spokeswoman said. “This has been communicated with all parties. \n“And as with all major events, Translink will provide public transport options for this event on their website in coming days.” Most viewed ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:16:45.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
