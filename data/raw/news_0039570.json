Enlarge Image \nSecond thoughts? Tristar Media, WireImage \nSenior business figures seem unsure how to react to the president and, specifically, his order temporarily suspending immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. \nWhile the order itself has been suspended by a court and protested by many tech CEOs, the whole issue of whether to support the president -- and how to show it or not -- has proved thorny. \nOn Wednesday, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk seemed to have decided to offer definitive comment. \nIn three tweets, spotted by Business Insider among others, Musk offered his updated views. \nFirst he said: \"Regarding govt. policy, there are often things that happen that most people don't agree with. This is normal for a functional democracy.\" \nTo which he added, using interesting words: \"The Muslim immigration ban is not right.\" \nHe ended this stream of Twittered thought with: \"They rarely warrant a public statement. However, the ban on Muslim immigrants from certain countries rises to this level. It is not right.\" \nWithin minutes, these tweets were all deleted . A Tesla spokesman wouldn't go beyond a further comment from Musk on Twitter.
