Sadly for her, she got her facts wrong and got roasted by the Mumbai police and Twitterati for it.\nThe bestselling author tried to crack a joke at the expense of the Mumbai police focussing on their fitness levels. She said \"heavy police bandobast in Mumbai today\" along with the picture of an overweight cop, punning on the word 'heavy' while alluding to the BMC Elections that were held in the metropolis on Tuesday.\n\nShobhaa De \nShe got a barrage of abuse and criticism on Twitter over her body shaming attempt, but it was Mumbai police who shut her down brilliantly. They were polite and dignified in their take down. They pointed out to her that the cop shown in the picture wasn't a Mumbai Police personnel, but one from Madhya Pradesh Police, clearly understandable from his shoulder badge.\nThe Mumbai Police department also said they \"expect better from responsible citizens\" like her.\n\nPolice personnel deputed at Sion. Pic/Pradeep Dhivar \nMumbai went to the hustings on Tuesday to elect members to the country's richest civic body -- the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.\nShe tweeted: \nHeavy police bandobast in Mumbai today! pic.twitter.com/sY0H3xzXl3 \n— Shobhaa De (@DeShobhaa) February 21, 2017 Mumbai Police replied with: \nWe love puns too Ms De but this one is totally imisplaced.
