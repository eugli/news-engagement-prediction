Police say 51-year-Daniel Marchese was also exposing himself when they arrived to find him in the running car, going in and out of consciousness in the middle of an intersection Monday afternoon.\nPolice say they found an open bottle of whiskey and two guns in the car, and that Marchese kicked at officers and threatened them.\nOnline court records show Marchese was still in custody awaiting arraignment Tuesday on charges including drunken driving, indecent exposure, aggravated assault and weapons offenses.
