Now, there's a booster for every skin concern. And the latest beauty brand to hop aboard the booster train? Make Up For Ever . That's right, MUFE, the cosmetics brand best known for its lineup of bold , glitter-y , and statement shades is officially joining team skin-care with its first-ever product touted to treat the complexion, not just cover and conceal it: the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD Skin Booster.

Also, allowing the serum to fully absorb means whatever comes next won't be overly slick or greasy.
