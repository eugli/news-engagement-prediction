(Getty Images) \nBarcelona remain keen on signing Marco Verratti having approached the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder about a transfer last summer, according to reports. \nSport claim that Ariedo Braida, who is Barca’s director of international football, met with the Italian to discuss his future on the Spanish island of Formentera. \nBarcelona did not have the funds to lure the 24-year-old from PSG but has made it clear that Camp Nou would be his ideal destination if he were to move. \nThe report claims that Barcelona have not given up hope of signing Verratti but know that the player is content with life in France and a transfer would be difficult to pull off this summer. Verratti delivered a masterclass against Barcelona in the Champions League last week. (Getty Images) \nChelsea have been heavily linked with a move for Verratti , while reports in Italy suggest that PSG value the midfielder at €80 million (£68.2m). \nVerratti delivered a masterclass against Barcelona’s midfield in the Champions League last week, and after PSG’s 4-0 victory, the Italy international insisted he wanted to stay with the French club.
