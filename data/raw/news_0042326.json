Back to school in Mosul as ISIS are DRIVEN from the city Thursday, 26th January 2017 School kids flocked to register in schools in Mosul as they opened for the first time in 2 years after ISIS are driven from the Iraqi city. 1 / 12 AFP/Getty Images An Iraqi boy sits at a desk at a school in Mosul's eastern Gogjali neighbourhood. \nBut moments later they were shot dead by an SAS sniper, who killed both men with head shots from 700 yards away. \nThe vehicle was later destroyed by a Javelin anti-tank missile fired by the elite troops. \nLater, the SAS unit reported that up to a ton of explosives had been inside, which could have caused hundreds of casualties if it had been set off. \nGETTY BRAVE: The SAS men urinated in the fuel tank while the jihadis slept metres away \nA source said: “This was a classic SAS operation where the troops on the ground were able to improvise and achieve a remarkable result. \n“The operation was launched on very little information from a trusted source who was able to provide an address of where a lorry bomb was being constructed. \n“The SAS team found the bomb factory but couldn’t disable the vehicle without potentially causing civilian casualties so they decided to contaminate the fuel tank. It worked brilliantly.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:05:16.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
