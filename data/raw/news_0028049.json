Or you’re tweeting about how mad you are that the holiday exists, how commercialized it is, etc. You could be the one posting a lot of lowercase Twitter memes about it. \nFor those of us enjoying it and celebrating the simple idea of love and all the various ways it presents itself, we’ve got fun lists like some of the best anime couples out there in the medium. These are the characters we strive to have relationships life in one way or another. Fun couples from all walks of life and some of the most familiar ones out there. Here are ten of the best anime couples out there. Vegeta and Bulma ( Dragon Ball Z ) \nGrowing up, I was a big Vegeta fan, and I liked to write fanfics that completely ignored Bulma, or wrote her out because my original character came into the picture and was also a Saiyan Princess. It was my greatest dream to marry the Prince of All Saiyans, but alas, that didn’t come true. Bulma Briefs ended up with Vegeta in Dragon Ball Z , much to my chagrin. They’re made for each other, because as obnoxious as Bulma is, she’s one of the only personalities in that world to deal with Vegeta properly, with an ego as big as his. RIP, my Vegeta fanfics, though. I’ll always have you. Utena Tenjou and Anthy Himemiya ( Revolutionary Girl Utena ) \nUtena would do anything within her power to keep her Rose Bride, Anthy Himemiya, safe. Despite Anthy’s initial submissiveness and tragic past, she blossoms into someone who harbors true feelings for Utena. Utena ends up sacrificing herself so Antsy can be freed from the curse she’s been put under as the Rose Bride, who goes to victors as a sort of “prize,” and that’s one of the most beautiful things you could probably do in a relationship if you ask me. Just watch Revolutionary Girl Utena , trust me. Haruka Tenou and Michiru Kaioh ( Sailor Moon ) \nDespite the bizarre child-friendly decision in the American dub version that made “Amara” and “Michelle” cousins, it’s always been clear that Haruka and Michiru are deeply in love. There’s nothing they wouldn’t do for the other, and watching their knowing glances at each other as Michiru plays classical music or as Haruka races in a super fast car is one of the most romantic parts of Sailor Moon as a whole. Miaka Yuki and Tamahome ( Fushigi Yugi ) \nIn the beginning, Tamahome was a bit of a cad to Miaka, but it’s no surprise that this dolt eventually realized he felt more for Miaka than he initially did, having gone from looking at her like a little sister to understanding his deep, romantic feelings for her. In this sprawling epic of a story that spans several lifetimes, it’s always satisfying to see Miaka and Tamahome embrace. Shuji and Chise ( S aikano ) \nIn Saikano , one of the most touching and depressing anime series of all time, clumsy Chise is slowly being turned into the most powerful military weapon in the world. All the while she’s trying to maintain a relationship with her first boyfriend ever as war goes on around them both. Watching them come together just as much as they fall apart has sort of a masochistic pleasure to it, and one that you’ll remember long after the series ends. Misato Katsuragi and Ryoji Kaji ( Neon Genesis Evangelion ) \nWatching Misato and Kaji interact is much like watching frenemies interact, but that’s part of what makes them such an interesting couple. I’m especially interested in the chemistry between them like in the famous elevator scene and the magnetism they so obviously display. No matter what time or year it is, these two are drawn to each other like magnets, and yet there’s still so much more I want to learn about them. Nana Osaki and Ren Honjo ( Nana ) \nThis punk rock romance is one for the ages, and even though it doesn’t end up like it should, or with a storybook conclusion, it’s a raucous ride from start to finish. There’s no arguing how much Sid Vicious lookalike Ren cares about Nana Osaki and watching their individual journeys through the music industry is one of the greatest draws of Nana as a whole. Just don’t get too invested and cry your eyes out near the end, because they’re one of the best-looking couples of all time. Yamato Rinko and Takeo Gouda ( My Love Story ) \nYou wouldn’t look at these two and assume they’re a romantic couple, but that’s the beauty of My Love Story . The show isn’t really about them getting together, but growing as a couple and becoming ever closer. It’s a touching and inspirational story that keeps getting better over the course of the show, and if you’ve ever felt like the ugly duckling no one would ever get with, know that there’s always someone out there waiting for you, especially in Takeo’s case. Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuuga ( Naruto ) \nWhen Naruto began, no one ever foresaw Hinata getting with the loudest ninja around. What about Sakura? Well never mind Sakura, because NaruHina is the pairing we didn’t know we wanted, but certainly the pairing we deserved. There’s not much to say aside from the fact that the image above really wraps up everything you could impart about the couple — they make a delightful little family, and it was refreshing to see them grow so much over the course of the show and its spinoff. Usagi Tsukino and Mamoru Chiba ( Sailor Moon ) \nThe ultimate anime couple can’t be debated: Usagi and Mamoru, or Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask. No matter which iteration of Sailor Moon you watch, whether it’s the classic show or Sailor Moon Crystal , one thing is always a constant: their undying love for each other, which spans time and space. In the name of the moon, they’ll always have each other, even when they have to find each other in another lifetime.
