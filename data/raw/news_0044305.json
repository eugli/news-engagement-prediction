Spend less on the Internet According to Ukoette, his decision to leave the PDP is as a result of the “rudderless nature of the party’s leadership.” Speaking to Premium Times, Ukoette said that besides the “animosity” within the PDP, there was so much uncertainty about the future of the party. He noted that he and his federal constituency have been marginalized in the state. He said: “The sharing formula of the dividends of democracy in the PDP has been faulty, and I have made persistent complaints about this without redress. “I feel that to key my people into the mainstream of national development, my movement to the APC is inevitable. “I am also seeing a situation whereby I will team up with other progressives to salvage Akwa Ibom from the grip of a certain few hawks who have formed an oligarchy in order to enslave and perpetually keep Akwa Ibom in a state of ruin. “I want to tell you that come 2019, the APC shall win Akwa Ibom. I want it to be on record that I said it.” The PDP has been thrown into a lingering leadership crisis after the party lost the 2015 presidential election to the APC. The party has two separate factions laying claim to the position of its national chairman. One of the factional leader of the party, Ali Modu Sheriff, last week secured a victory at the Court of Appeal, Port Harcourt, which declared him the authentic chairman. However, the other faction led by Ahmed Makarfi, have rejected the judgment and have indicated their intention to head to the Supreme Court.
