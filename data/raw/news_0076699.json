He had hoped to see some predators. \n\"Instead of predators, we saw this dazzle of zebras drinking from the waterhole. We suddenly noticed that the one zebra was actively attacking a young foal. First, it was a bit shocking but then I thought - it's the way of nature,” Tjärnén said. \nAccording to Richard de Gouveia's blog at Sabi Sabi , Zebras normally live in harms with one dominant male and up to six females. The younger males normally form bachelor herds and wait until they can start their own harem. \nCompetition for females is fierce, and sometimes they take a female from another herd. \nIf she is pregnant the male will rape her until she aborts the pregnancy. If she doesn't, and a live foal is born, the male will normally kick it to death. \nThe foal appears to have escaped into the bush - but it was injured and the male was still after it.
