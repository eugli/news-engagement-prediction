Hairston & Youthful Praise notch their first Gospel Airplay leader. \nDanny Gokey banks his third No. 1 on Billboard 's Christian Airplay chart (dated March 4), as \"Rise,\" the title track and lead single from his second full-length, increases 5 percent to 11 million audience impressions in the week ending Feb. 19, according to Nielsen Music. \n\"Rise\" is the 2009 American Idol third-place finalist's third Christian Airplay No. 1. His genre debut, \"Hope in Front of Me,\" topped the survey for three weeks in 2014 and \"Tell Your Heart to Beat Again\" led the June 11, 2016-dated survey. \n\"I’m Incredibly grateful to see how 'Rise’ has connected, not only with radio, but with all of our fans,\" Gokey tells Billboard . \"It feels like the song has become a reminder that yesterday's disappointments don't have to effect today.\" \nOn the Hot Christian Songs chart, which combines airplay, sales and streaming data, \"Rise\" rebounds 6-5, matching its prior peak. It zips 23-14 on Christian Digital Song Sales, up 30 percent to 2,000 downloads sold (in the week ending Feb. 16), sparked in part by a 69-cent sale tag in the iTunes Store. \nFIRST No. 1: J.J. Hairston & Youthful Praise achieve their first leader on Billboard 's Gospel Airplay chart, as worship track \"You Deserve It\" climbs 2-1. The choir achieved five prior top 10s, starting with the No. 6-peaking \"Incredible God\" in 2006. \nOn the multi-metric Hot Gospel Songs chart, \"Deserve\" dominates for a fourth week. It tops Gospel Digital Song sales for a 10th week, with 1,000 downloads sold. \nHERE'S HOLLYN: While Reba McEntire's faith-based Sing It Now: Songs of Faith & Hope leads Top Christian Albums, as well as Top Country Albums, for a second frame (26,000 equivalent album units, down 52 percent), One-Way Conversations , the full-length debut from 20-year-old singer-songwriter Hollyn, arrives at No. 6 (4,000 units). \nHollyn, born Holly Marie Miller and based just outside of Nashville (in Franklin, Tenn.), adds her second Top Christian Albums top 10. She reached No. 10 with her self-titled EP in November 2015. \nThe new set's \"Can't Live Without\" leaps 34-23 on Hot Christian Songs. \nNEW TOP 10s: Rock band NEEDTOBREATHE banks its ninth Hot Christian Songs top 10, as \"Testify\" lifts 11-9. On Christian Airplay, it pushes to a new high (7-6; 7.5 million in audience, up 3 percent). \nFinally, We Are Messengers' \"Magnify\" becomes the Irish act's first Hot Christian Songs top 10 (12-10). It ranks at No. 8 on Christian Airplay (7 million).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:08:38.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
