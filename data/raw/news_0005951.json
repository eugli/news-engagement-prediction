Clothing, mobile devices and video games among other products are all in the domain of possibilities for her to create. The application is on the road to being approved very soon, according to TMZ . \nIt may be a while before we get to experience what Blue comes up with for the masses, but she’s already shown interest in beauty products and fashion. The budding mogul already knows to let everybody aware of who she’s wearing.
