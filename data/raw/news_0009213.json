Key points: Liberal Party received almost $15 million in donations throughout 2015-16, AEC figures show It is still not clear if Malcolm Turnbull donated to the election campaign Largest donation to the federal Liberal Party was from mining magnate Paul Marks \nNew figures released today by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) show that the Liberal Party received almost $15 million in donations throughout 2015-16, up from about $10.3 million the previous year. \nImmigration Minister Peter Dutton donated $50,000 and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann donated $29,000. \nSenator Simon Birmingham also donated $20,000, while Greg Mirabella — husband of failed Liberal candidate and former MP Sophie Mirabella — donated $35,000. \nIt is still not clear if Mr Turnbull donated to the campaign, as reported last year. \nAn initial search by the ABC failed to find any evidence of a donation by Mr Turnbull or any companies listed in his register of interests. \nDonations made in the final days of the election — on July 1 or 2 — will not be disclosed until next year and Mr Turnbull has never confirmed any figure for personal donations. \nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten yesterday criticised the Prime Minister for the delay in publicising any potential donations. \n\"He's always known this day would come. Why wait?\" he said. \n\"If 210 days of avoiding scrutiny is within the rules — then the rules are just wrong.\" \nThe Labor Party received more than $10.3 million in donations, up from $7.3 million in 2014-15. \nOnly donations over $13,000 had to be declared to the electoral commission, which means many of the gifts received by the parties remain private. Mining magnate makes largest donation \nThe largest donation to the federal Liberal Party was $1.3 million on July 2 from mining magnate and Nimrod Resources chairman Paul Marks. \nStuart Robert resigned from the Turnbull ministry in early 2016 after it was revealed he had shares in a trust linked to the Australian company. \nMr Robert travelled to China in 2014 to witness a signing ceremony for a deal between Nimrod and a Chinese business, but claimed he was not aware of any interest or connection to Mr Marks. \nMr Marks is also a close friend of former prime minister Tony Abbott, who billed taxpayers to attend the mining magnate's birthday bash in 2015. \nMr Marks also donated $30,000 to the Tasmanian Liberal Party on May 26, via another company P Marks Investment Pty Ltd. \nTop Education Institute donated more than $47,000 to the Liberal Party across eight separate donations and $23,500 to the Labor Party in the 2015-16 period. \nLate last year, Sam Dastyari resigned from Labor's frontbench after it was revealed that the Institute reimbursed the Commonwealth after the Senator blew his parliamentary travel budget. \nFormer politicians Ian Macfarlane and Craig Emerson also donated $69,000 and $1,500 to their parties respectively. \nFormer politician Clive Palmer came under scrutiny last year after it was revealed his companies donated almost $10 million to his political party throughout 2014-15, in addition to almost $26 million the previous financial year. \nThe latest figures show that the Palmer United Party — which now has no representatives in Parliament — declared more than $2.2 million in receipts throughout 2015-16, including a donation of $400,000 from Mineralogy and more than $900,000 listed under \"other receipt\" from the same company. \nThe Greens received close to $3 million in donations, including $500,000 from entrepreneur Graeme Wood and $500,00 from high-end gambler Duncan Turpie. \nLuo Chuangxiong donated $50,000 to Labor in 2015-16, following on from a total of $200,000 in donations in 2013-14. \nMr Luo participated in the Chinese Business Leader Roundtable Meeting convened by former NSW premier Barry O'Farrell and facilitated by Huang Xiangmo of Yuhu in April 2014. \nAs an honorary chairman of the Chao Shan Association of Australia, Mr Luo is frequently involved in meeting and greeting senior political figures from China. \nHong Kong Kingston Investment Co. Ltd, headed by Chau Chak Wing, donated a total of $150,000 to Labor and $710,00 to the Liberal Party. \nMr Chau is linked to a partly state-backed newspaper, the Australian New Express Daily, launched by then NSW premier Bob Carr in 2004. \nMr Carr is also an honorary president of the Association of Australia China Friendship and Exchange, of which Mr Chau is president. \nNimbin Hemp Embassy also donated $17,00 to the Help End Marijuana Prohibition Party.
