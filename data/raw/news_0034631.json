E4 Bear excuses himself to use the bathroom - but takes his coat with him E4 9 His poor date is oblivious that he is planning to run away \nBear immediately shifts conversation to sex, by crudely asking: “When shall we make babies?” – prompting his date to laugh nervously. \nAs a waiter approaches to take their order, Bear asks for a glass of water before excusing himself to go to the bathroom. E4 9 Bear complains to the camera that he can't go through with the date \nTurning to the waiter, he asks: “Have you got a toilet, mate? I'm so sorry... my bladder is killing me.” \nBear then ensures his date has her drink order in place and also suggests some garlic bread and cheese for a start before excusing himself for the bathroom – taking his jacket with him. E4 9 Bear runs away after ordering water and garlic bread \nAs he departs, he even says to his date: “Babe - don't you be kissing anyone else,” and begs her to “Stay there.” \nHe then risks humiliating his date as he makes a desperate dash away from the table and tells the camera crew he intends to ditch the date altogether. E4 9 He tells the dating agency that his date wasn't what he was expecting \n“I can't lie... she's nothing like I was expecting,” Bear explained – even though his first words involved love at first site and a lust to impregnate his date. \n“I gotta get out of here. It's not for me. I can't. I can't do it. I'll be honest with you, it's not for me,” he adds to the crew. \nCelebs Go Dating continues on E4. \nGot a story? email or call us direct on 02077824220", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:10:50.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
