who share the world's longest common border - run deep. \nThree-quarters of Canada's exports go to the US, and Canada is the top destination for exports for many US states. \nTrudeau, a fervent supporter of free trade, emphasized the importance of NAFTA and issued a subtle warning about the risks of protectionism for the US states. \n\"Make no mistake, at the end of the day, Canada and the US will always remain each other's most essential partner,\" Trudeau said. \n\"As we know, 35 US states list Canada as their largest export market, and our economies benefit from the over $2 billion in two-way trade that takes place every single day. \n\"Millions of good, middle class jobs on both sides of the border depend on this crucial partnership.\" \nTrump had not been specific on how he wants NAFTA talks to develop, but has repeatedly trashed the 23-year-old pact, calling it a \"catastrophe\" for American jobs and threatening to slap tariffs on imports from Mexico. \nPOLAR OPPOSITES \nTrump and Trudeau are a study in contrasts: their path to power, their political stripes, their style - they could not be more different. \nManhattan property mogul Trump won the White House in a shock November election victory over Hillary Clinton after painting a dark picture of a country in turmoil and vowing to put \"America first.\" \nTrudeau, the son of a well-liked prime minister, came to power promising to \"provide a positive and good government for Canadians\" and enhance the country's image abroad. \nFamily connections were deployed by both sides on Monday, with Ivanka Trump sitting in on the two leaders' meeting with female business leaders and Trudeau gifting Trump a photo of his father and the now US president together. -
