Article continues below \nWhether picking the midfielders who provided impeccable service for his goals or the defenders who prevented them going in at the other end, Owen is spoilt for choice when it comes to selecting a dream team. \nAsked to name his dream career six-a-side team, the 37-year-old has put together a formidable outfit of former colleagues as per Squawka . Article continues below Kevin Nolan signs himself for Notts County GK: EDWIN VAN DER SAR \nOwen opts for the Dutchman ahead of the obvious alternative in Iker Casillas, likely because he spent an entire two seasons longer with the former while clinching the 2010-11 Premier League title. DEF: RIO FERDINAND & NEMANJA VIDIC \nIt’s difficult to name a more solid defensive partnership in recent history than Ferdinand and Vidic. \nThe pair – who won five Premier League titles during nine seasons together at Old Trafford – is likely to be one Owen is glad he never had to face. MID: ZINEDINE ZIDANE & STEVEN GERRARD \nA combination of Zidane’s technique and Gerrard’s power in a midfield duo truly is reserved only for fantasy team selections. \nThe clear choice for Owen despite spending only one season with the Frenchman at Real Madrid. FWD: RONALDO \nOwen played with the likes of Raul and Robbie Fowler, yet he simply can’t go past the iconic Brazilian. \nIl Fenomeno netted a stunning 24 goals in all competitions during Owen’s maiden campaign at the Santiago Bernabeu, making his selection one of the few no-brainers in this team. \nIt’s always difficult for former pros to pick one ex-teammate over another, but this is certainly a top drawer selection of incredibly talented players.
