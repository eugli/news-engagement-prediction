Dun & Bradstreet , on a $10.9 million contract, and Probe Group and Australian Receivables , both on $2.6 million contracts are all contracted by Centrelink.\nCentrelink’s debt recovery program has been highly controversial, with many of those hit with debt notices claiming they were inaccurate, dated back more than five years or were entirely non-existent. Many of the thousands of Australians who say the alleged debts were wrongly calculated are extremely vulnerable, making it harder for them to dispute the charges.\nJack Rogerson, from Brisbane, was wrongly billed $3000 for a period when the 21-year-old was on disability benefit because of his autism — but only heard about it when he received a call from a debt collector.\n“Debt collectors shouldn’t be able to directly call individuals with a diagnosed intellectual disability,” his mother Nicole told news.com.au.\nCentrelink has admitted there is a problem with it having the wrong contact details for people, and consequently failing to notify them before the debt collection agencies are already chasing the money.\nIt has said it is working on the problem, but those already in the hands of the private agencies are struggling to extricate themselves. The private companies will not cancel debts unless told to do so by Centrelink, and disputes with the government agency can take months, with long waits on the phone, glitches with the automated system that make it impossible to update and staff unable to help in branches.\nNicole Rogerson says debt collectors called her 21-year-old son Jack, who has autism, over an inaccurate overpayment. Source: Supplied \nColleen McCormack, from Melbourne, has mental health issues, and said she felt “bullied” by Centrelink over her disputed $3000 overpayment. Just two weeks after the agency said her repayment was due, she received a letter from the debt collectors (in December last year).\nShe told news.com.au the caller from Dun & Bradstreet was “rude and pushy” and would not agree to a reasonable payment plan. “They said $2000 today then they can break the other amount down to small payments. Who has a spare $2000 laying around before Christmas? This has caused me major anxiety and a lot of crying as I couldn’t get my family or foster kid presents.”\nColleen McCormack received this letter from collection agency Dun & Bradstreet just two weeks after her disputed Centrelink repayment was due. Source: Supplied \nElijah Smit, from Brisbane, who is gay and has no children, was contacted by a debt collection agency telling him his child support was overdue.\n“It became less funny when randomly Centrelink discharged a debt in my name to their contracted debt collectors Probe Group,” he told news.com.au. “The first phone call was fine — the lady was very understanding and suggested I contact Centrelink to initiate a dispute.\nUnfortunately, I work Monday to Friday 8.30-5pm in an office which requires I answer the phone. Sitting on hold for an hour and 45 minutes isn’t going to go down well.”\nElijah Smit has been trying to resolve an inaccurate debt with Centrelink for more than three months. Source: Supplied \nHe sent an email, but received no reply. “I called their debt company last week to give them an update and was told in no uncertain terms that I needed to start making payments and if the debt was deemed invalid they would pay me back.”\nWhen he explained he was disputing the debt, he was told: “Centrelink says you pay so you pay.”\nCatherine Hehir was warned she could face debt collectors if she didn’t start paying back money she didn’t owe. Source: Supplied \nCatherine Hehir, from Brisbane, was told to pay back a debt $4500 from a period when she was studying. When the 27-year-old disputed the claim, she was advised to begin paying anyway, and says the threat of the debt collectors would undoubtedly push people into effectively admitting guilt by starting to pay back money they do not owe.\n“They suggested that I start a payment plan even before my review was complete to avoid being taken to a debt collector and they would reimburse me later if they found the debt was incorrect, which I refused to do because I knew it was wrong. Maybe that is what they are talking about their ‘recovery success rate’ because people start paying to avoid worse outcomes.”\nEliza Milliken, a young doctor in Sydney, said she was contacted by debt collectors from Probe Group claiming to be Government employees.\nShe had not received any letters from Centrelink and the first she heard of the alleged debt was when she picked up the phone on a Sunday evening earlier this month to hear a male voice say: “This is the Department of Human Services.”\nIt was only when she questioned whether he was from the government department responsible for Centrelink or from a debt collection agency that he admitted it was the latter.\nSydney doctor Eliza Milliken said an employee at debt collection agency Probe claimed to be from the Government. Source: Supplied \nA letter or call from a debt collection company is often the first they hear of the debt, as was the case for Eliza, who told Triple J’s Hack program she was sent a barrage of texts asking her to contact Probe on an “urgent matter”.\nDebt collectors F/Probe Group claiming to be #Centrelink employees isn't legal. Complain to #Centrelink & ombudsman. #scam #auspol #GetUp \n— Eliza Milliken (@elizamilliken) February 7, 2017 Darren O’Connell, who has a PhD in economics and lectured at Curtin University in Western Australia, told news.com.au he tried eight times to get his inaccurate debt removed from the system, but instead of having his case reviewed, he was referred to Dun & Bradstreet, who are chasing him for $321.53 from FY10-11, plus 10 per cent in recovery fees.\n“Here is another example of Centrelink ludicrous logic,” he said. “It is telling people that they should enter into voluntary repayment plans with D&B while it sorts out its IT issues. Should the debt be successfully appealed customer should then applies to D&B for a refund! How this advice can be given credibly and with a straight face underlines just how flawed, dangerous and opaque Centrelink’s process is. Centrelink and the government needs to be held more accountable.”\nMinister for Human Services Alan Tudge told Hack yesterday that he would “like to get to the bottom of Eliza’s story. It’s quite disturbing that one of the debt collectors would portray themselves as being from the Department of Human Services. If that is correct, that’s a serious issue. News.com.au has contacted the minister in relation to other cases. They are yet to respond.\nIf you have been contacted by Centrelink or a debt collection agency regarding an overpayment you think is wrong, follow our guide to what your options are. \nShare your story in the comments below or email emma.reynolds@news.com.au .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:49:38.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
