The announcement comes a little more than two weeks after a representative for the singer denied reports Madonna was in the midst of adoption proceedings. Officials in Malawi confirmed to CNN at the time that the singer was planning to adopt two children. Madonna's \"long standing history with Malawi\" was noted in adoption documents obtained by CNN, including her numerous charitable efforts. She recently raised $7.5 million for her foundation, which plans to fund the construction of a pediatric surgery ward at The Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. That facility is scheduled to open next year, the documents said.
