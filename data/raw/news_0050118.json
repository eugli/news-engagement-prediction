You can read more about ABC Editorial Policies here but at its simplest the ABC strives for independence, accuracy, fairness and impartiality. \nOn Q&A panellists and audience members are expressing their own opinions which may be controversial and they’re making assertions of fact that others might challenge. The program is designed to bring together a range of views on the panel and in the audience and we rely on the panellists and audiences to argue the case for their different points of view as well as providing an opportunity for others to comment and respond in social and mainstream media. Q&A isn’t endorsing the opinions expressed; it’s providing a safe place for Australians to discuss their differences. \nHow is the audience chosen? \nPotential audience members register on the Q&A website providing basic demographic information and answering a standard opinion poll question about their political leanings. \nOur audience producers contact people who register to invite a studio audience that includes a good mix of political views including supporters of both the major and minor parties. We also aim for a good mix of gender and other diversity measures and we take the program outside Sydney and Melbourne when we can to allow people around the country to participate too. \nWe encourage people to submit video questions, use Skype, web, Twitter and Facebook questions to further break down those geographic barriers as much as we can. \nHow is the panel chosen? \nQ&A generally has five panellists on a discussion moderated by our regular host Tony Jones. \nSometimes we vary the number, adding someone to cover a late breaking event or having smaller panels to provide more in depth discussion. Occasionally, we will set up a head to head debate on a major policy issue, highlight a special area like science, religion or business or focus on a major leader such as the Prime Minister. \nBut as a general rule, the aim is to represent both sides of politics as well as voices from business, the arts, media, lobby groups, academia and the broader community. \nQ&A is designed to be an engaging and insightful range of views: not a simple breakdown into left versus right. It aims at a complex discussion where two or three panellists can agree on one issue, but be at odds on another. \nWhy do you have so many politicians on the panel? \nPolitical decisions have a big impact on our lives and so Australian citizens should have every opportunity to be involved in the democratic process. For that reason, politicians will always be a significant presence on Q&A. \nWhile there may only be very limited opportunities to express your view through a vote at election time, Q&A encourages people to get involved every week – find out the facts, form an opinion, talk politics to your friends, write a letter, send a #QandA Tweet, attend Q&A, submit a video, ask a question. Or simply watch Q&A on television, radio or Facebook: politics is important and we do our best to make the program entertaining and engaging because the more people are involved and paying attention – the better. \nWhat topics does Q&A cover? \nWhile we aim to touch on the major topical issues of the week, we are also very much influenced by whatever is on the mind of our audience. \nWe send the audience a list of topics in the news and background information on our panel when we ask for their questions, and we share that list with the panel too. Every week we encourage the audience to ask fresh questions. We see Q&A as an opportunity to reset the public agenda with the questions audience members think important, even if those questions are being ignored by the mainstream media. \nHow are the questions chosen? \nWe encourage everyone attending Q&A to submit their questions by email before they arrive. \nOn Monday afternoon we sort through the hundreds that arrive each week to put together a short list of questions for the panel. We also encourage people to submit questions by video on the web and via Facebook and Twitter or even write them out when they arrive at the studio. \nWe organise questions on a short list so that the program has a structure with related questions following on one after another rather than jumping back and forth at random. We always have more good questions that we can use. We run out of time before we can get to them all. \nWe continue to experiment with ways to give our audience a voice in choosing and prioritising the questions and topics Q&A addresses. \nQ&A has always been live to allow real time interaction with the whole viewing audience. From the first program in 2008 Q&A encouraged TV viewers to interact by SMS and video to add questions and comments from outside the studio. Since then by building a large social media conversation and by incorporating live questions and comments into the TV program, Q&A has become a world leader in interactivity. \nQ&A is committed to constantly extending the opportunities for interaction into new and growing platforms so that a wider variety of people can participate. \nDoes the panel know the questions in advance? \nNo. Our panellists will of course have their own ideas on the likely main topics of the week and at least one or two will be professional politicians trained to read the public mood, but they never really know what the audience will ask. We want them to be surprised. \nWho can be part of Q&A? Do you screen your audience? \nWe want Q&A to be open to everyone, with very few exceptions. We don’t allow people who are paid political staffers to ask questions and we don’t allow people who pose a security threat or may want to disrupt Q&A’s civil discussion. \nBeyond those few exceptions, we aim to be inclusive and transparent. \nWe welcome people interested and involved in politics and public discussion because encouraging people to get involved is a Q&A objective. Being a member of a political party for example is not a barrier to asking a question. \nBeing inclusive means that ordinary citizens, who can vote, write letters to the newspaper, speak out on social media or attend public rallies and meetings should also be entitled to come along to Q&A and ask a question. \nOn the other hand, being transparent means disclosing when questioners who are otherwise unknown to our audience have a special interest or relevant background in relation to the question they’re asking. \nThat might be the mother of a disabled child asking about disability funding or the head of the local chamber of commerce asking about small business tax breaks. It might be someone with a criminal past asking about law and order, or even someone with a history of aggressive and angry comments on social media asking why debate on social media is so aggressive and angry. Context and background is important for our audiences. \nThat’s why we ask questioners to be honest and open about their interests and connections to Q&A producers and take steps to research the background of questioners. It’s part of our commitment to being both inclusive and transparent. \nHow are onscreen tweets chosen? \nThe first point to make is that they are chosen quickly. \nEach week, Q&A receives thousands more comments via Twitter than it can possibly screen. Inevitably, a great many relevant and incisive comments are missed, and occasionally inappropriate or off-topic ones slip through. \nQ&A is not endorsing the opinions expressed in onscreen tweets: the aim is to choose comments that are relevant to the topic being discussed, that represent a diverse range of perspectives, and that add something new, interesting or entertaining to the discussion. You can read our guidelines here. \nWhat is the role of the Q&A host? \nFirst and foremost, the host is there to manage and facilitate the discussion, to keep it moving and to ensure that the questions from the audience are given the respect and attention they deserve and all panellists have a fair opportunity to respond. \nSo the most important follow up question Tony Jones can ask is usually: “Have they answered your question?” \nThere are opportunities for the host to follow up and expand on audience questions, but Q&A is different because it’s about giving citizens rather than journalists the chance to question our leaders and we will always try to give priority to your questions.
