The newly discovered Angolan dwarf galago belongs to the bushbaby family, members of which are found all over sub-Saharan Africa. \nThe creature’s most distinctive characteristic is its call: a chirping crescendo followed by a twitter, report Magdalena Svensson of Oxford Brookes University, UK, and her colleagues. \nThis is similar to calls by made by other members of the dwarf galago genus to keep in contact with their group, and is why the researchers have classed the new animal as another dwarf galago . But the new creature is three times the size of its closest relatives – making it more similar to non-dwarf bushbabies in stature.

The locations where the animals were sighted are not protected, and their forests are under threat. \n“Logging is incredibly rampant in Angola at the moment,” says Svensson. “The habitat is disappearing.” \nThe Angolan dwarf galago is only the fifth new primate species discovered in mainland Africa since 2000. Svensson thinks more species await discovery. \nThe wildlife in the area has been little studied, partly because of the Angolan civil war which lasted from the 1970s until 2002. “We went there to do a recce to see what was there,” says Svensson.
