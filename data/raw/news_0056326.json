Pay rises in the public sector are capped at 1 per cent a year until 2020. \nIpsa said: \"This is in line with our determination on MPs’ pay, published in July 2015, where we committed to adjusting MPs’ pay for the rest of this Parliament at the same rate as changes in public sector earnings published by the Office of National Statistics .\" \nHowever, the pay rise is still below inflation which hit a two-and-a-half-year high of 1.8 per cent in January and is expected to head towards three per cent later this year. \nIn 2015 IPSA made the decision to increase MPs’ salaries by 10 per cent last year from £67,000 to £74,000. \nThe move triggered a spate of politicians promising to refuse to take the rise and donate the extra money to charity. \nUnder a system designed to take the issue out of political control, MPs salaries are automatically linked to the Office for National Statistics' calculation of average public sector pay. \nThe increase, which is calculated on the basis of all payments on public sector payslips, including items including bonuses, is automatic and not subject to approval ​in Parliament. Ministerial salaries, which are controlled by Government, have been frozen to 2020.
