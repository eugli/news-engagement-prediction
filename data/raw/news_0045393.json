While both of these devices are not exactly the latest offerings from the Japanese company, any price cut is always welcome. \nLet’s start with the more interesting device of the two, the Xperia Z5. As one of Sony’s 2015 flagship smartphones – alongside the Z5 Premium – the Z5 originally retails at RM2,699 when it was first launched in Malaysia . Now, the device goes for only RM1,799; that’s a RM900 price cut. \nFor that kind of money, the Xperia Z5 actually offers pretty good value for money. It features a 5.2-inch 1080p display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor paired with 3GB of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, a 2,900mAh battery, 23MP rear and 5MP front-facing cameras, a fingerprint sensor, and most importantly, IP65/IP68 water and dust resistance. \nThe Xperia M5, on the other hand, receives a more modest price cut: it now retails at RM1,199 instead of its original asking price of RM1,599. In terms of specifications, the M5 packs a 5-inch 1080p display, a MediaTek Helio X10 processor paired with 3GB of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, a 2,600mAh battery, a 21MP rear camera, as well as a 13MP front-facing snapper. It also boasts IP65/IP68 rating, much like the Xperia Z5. PlayStation VR Review: The Best VR Experience Yet \nIt makes a lot of sense for Sony Malaysia to revise the prices of these two devices. After all, they were launched back in 2015. If you’re keen to get your hands on either of these two phones, you can do so on Sony Malaysia’s online store . 2 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:09:50.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
