The presenters are Steven Gatjen and Viviane Geppert, with Germany's Next Top Model judge Michael Michalsky commenting on fashion and style. From 2:30 a.m. German time on, Pro7 will be carrying the ceremony live. \nThe channel has pre- and post-Oscar coverage as well, starting from Saturday, 8:15 p.m., with a show — Big Blockbuster – The Best Hollywood Films — about past Oscar winners. And starting at 11:30 p.m. Sunday, the network will start an Oscar countdown with the most memorable moments from Oscars past. \nOn Monday, at 5 p.m. local time, Pro7's celebrity show, Red , will have an Oscar recap episode. \nFrance \nThe Oscars will take over France's CanalPlus from midnight until 6 a.m. local time, with hosts Didier Allouch and Laurent Weil starting red-carpet coverage as the clock strikes 12. Programming will air live and unencrypted on the pay TV channel. \nThe ceremony begins at 2:30 a.m. local time Monday when French viewers can tune in to see if Isabelle Huppert takes home the best actress Oscar for her role in smash hit Elle . \nIn case anyone missed a moment, the ceremony will be rerun Tuesday night beginning at 11:30 p.m., but then will be behind the paywall. \nItaly \nAs in previous years, the 89th edition of the Academy Awards will air in Italy exclusively on Sky Italia channels. \nA dedicated Oscars channel on Sky Cinema from Saturday, Feb. 18 to Sunday, March 5, dubbed Sky Cinema Oscar, has been showing previous winners, as well as has the exclusive Italian TV premiere of Spotlight . \nThe ceremony will air live from 10:50 p.m. to 6 a.m. local time on Sky Cinema Oscar and on free-to-air channel TV8. \nSpain \nPay TV provider Telefonica's Movistar+ will offer a preshow with its own live red-carpet coverage on its Canal+ Estrenos channel, starting at 1:00 a.m. Spanish time, followed by the full ceremony on the same channel starting at 2:30 a.m. Monday morning. \nHungary \nDuna TV, an entertainment channel that is part of Hungary's six-channel public broadcaster MTVA, will air the ceremony live for the second year running. Last year, Hungarian Holocaust feature Son of Saul won the best foreign-language movie award. This year there are no local films in the running for best foreign-language film, but Duna TV will air the 89th Academy Awards red carpet and ceremony live 1 a.m.-6 a.m. local time Monday. Last year's live show, seen by an audience of around to 200,000, proved so popular that this year Duna TV is running a special prize promotion, offering 25 pairs of cinema tickets to viewers who correctly guess the main Oscar winners. The network's web site also lists photos and video clips from shortlisted films, actors and other Oscar categories to get viewers in the mood ahead of Hollywood's annual awards ceremony. \nPoland \nCanal + is again the only Polish network that will air the awards ceremony live, hosted by Polish TV personality Grazyna Torbicka. Studio guests will introduce the live coverage of the ceremony, and edited highlights will be available to subscribers at 9 p.m. local time on Tuesday. Both shows will also be available for Canal+ VOD subscribers. \nRussia \nJust like in the three previous years, the Oscars will not air live in Russia. The country's largest TV network, state-run free-to-air Channel One, will air a short taped highlights version of the awards ceremony on Monday night, 20 hours after the ceremony takes place in Los Angeles. On Oscars night, Channel One will air Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , the winner of the 2005 best original screenplay Oscar. From 2004 to 2013, the network aired the ceremony live. However, in 2014, a previously scheduled live broadcast was canceled due to tensions in neighboring Ukraine. According to most recent reports, the network switched to airing taped versions as the live broadcasts, which aired very late at night in most of the Russian territory, failed to generate sufficient ratings. \nMiddle East \nGiven the time differences, only the most hardened of Oscar fans will be tuning in across the Middle East, with the ceremony kicking off at 5.30 a.m. Dubai time exclusively on the Movies Festival HD channel of pan-Arab satellite TV operator OSN. The red carpet action is a little more palatable, starting at 2 a.m. on E! However, with OSN not present in Iran, the region's only country represented on the night, director Asghar Farhadi may be forced to see whether his film The Salesman triumphs in the foreign-language category via a VPN or YouTube link-up. \nChina \nThe Oscars will air live on Monday at 9:30 a.m. local time in China. \nFor the third year running, the online live rights went to M1905, the streaming video service of the state broadcaster’s movie channel, CCTV6. An edited version of the awards show also will be aired by CCTV6 later in the day. \nJapan \nThe Wowow satellite network, which has carried the Academy Awards ceremony since 2000, will once again air it on its Prime channel live starting at 9 a.m. Monday morning Japan time with the red carpet, which will be available free to non-subscribers. From 10 a.m., the ceremony coverage will begin for Wowow subscribers only, presented by Jon Kabira and Aya Takeshima. It will be a bilingual broadcast, allowing viewers to switch between Japanese and English. A subtitled repeat is set for 9 p.m. Monday local time. \nKorea \nCJ E&M's cable network Channel CGV, devoted to movies, will again air the Oscars live for the seventh straight year. It will start airing them at 10 a.m. Monday morning local time, featuring local film critic Lee Dong-jin as a commentator. CJ will also stream the awards online, in real time, through its online TV platform TVing.com. \nCJ also owns the country's largest multiplex cinema chain and is currently showing 17 nominated films in its indie/art house theater CGV Arthouse. \nIndia \n21st Century Fox's Star India will air the Oscars on its Star Movies and Star Movies Select HD channels live at 5:30 a.m. Monday, beginning with the red-carpet arrivals. \nThe coverage will also be streamed on the network's digital platform, hotstar. A primetime repeat will air on Star Movies and Star Movies Select HD the same evening at 8:30 p.m. \nElsewhere in Asia \nHBO Asia is airing the Oscars live again in such countries and territories as Hong Kong, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:25:54.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
