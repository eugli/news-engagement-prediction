There were shockwaves across social media when La La Land was mistakenly named the Best Picture at the 2017 Oscars over the real winner, Moonlight , at the Dolby Theatre in L.A. on Sunday, February 26. Relive the now infamous moment in the video above! Oscars 2017: The Cutest Candid Red Carpet Moments \nAs Us Weekly previously reported, presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway presented the last award of the evening. When it came time to announce the winner, the Reds star paused for several seconds before his Bonnie and Clyde costar grabbed the envelope and announced the winner was La La Land . \nBut within minutes after the cast, crew and producers of the hit musical took to the stage, Academy Awards host Jimmy Kimmel came out to explain that there'd been a mistake. La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz quickly (and graciously) announced to the audience that the winner of the night's final Oscar was in fact Moonlight . â€˜La La Land' producer Jordan Horowitz announces the actual Best Picture winner as 'Moonlight' after a presentation error with actor Warren Beatty onstage with Jimmy Kimmel during the 89th Annual Academy Awards in 2017.
