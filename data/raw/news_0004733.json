The total collection of the film now stands at Rs 97.03 crore.\nAsked whether the movie can shatter stereotypes about the blind, the \"Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai\" star admitted that cinema had indeed propagated the \"cinematic blind\".\n\"I hope so (it breaks stereotypes). It is my cinema that has propagated the cinematic blind which is a lie. That's not how the blind are. Not that the film is about a message, but when you believe characters like this, you know that they (audiences) are aware.
