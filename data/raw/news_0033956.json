The two parties are contesting the polls together.(REUTERS) \nIn a bid to ensure that their candidates don’t face each other in the Uttar Pradesh assembly election, the Congress and the Samajwadi Party (SP) have asked 10 candidates to withdraw. \nA joint list issued by the two parties on Tuesday had the names of five candidates from each party. The two parties asked the district office bearers to ask the candidates to withdraw from the polls. \nOn Monday too, the Congress had asked four candidates to withdraw from the contest. However, three of them refused to do so, with some hoping that the party will ultimately agree to friendly contests. \nThose asked to withdraw include Congress candidate from Lucknow (Central), Maruf Khan, who appears to have turned a rebel. \nOn Tuesday, Khan declared that he would contest the polls. The party’s candidate from Payagpur, Bhagat Ram Mishra, has also declared that he had been allotted a poll symbol and would contest the election.

I have been now allotted a Congress symbol and so will contest the poll,” said Singh. \nGonda’s city Congress president Abdul Rehman said the party’s candidate from Mankapur (Gonda), Hanuman Prasad, has decided to withdraw. \nThe names of Khan and Mishra figured in the joint list released on Tuesday. \nOther Congress candidates asked to withdraw include Abhimanyu Singh (Bindki), Jawahar Lal Diwakar (Soraon), and Bhagoti Chaudhary (Chhanve).

As per their understanding, the SP was to field candidates on 298 seats, giving 105 seats to the Congress.
