Most notably, he used it for a particularly lengthy and awkward handshake with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week— but when he tried to use the same handshake on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday, his fellow world leader pushed back.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below President Trump welcomes Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the White House. https://t.co/n7TqA3VDnW pic.twitter.com/5TcpyDfZx5\n— ABC News (@ABC) February 13, 2017 Based on video of the exchange, the pair can be seen in a bit of a handshake stand-off, consisting of Trudeau pushing back and forth to keep their hands centered between them. Both also immediately grabbed the other's shoulder, almost in an attempt to take control of the handshake — and when you give the whole thing a closer look, it's actually awkward AF.\nPeople quickly took notice of Trudeau's refusal to give in to Trump's handshake, and took to Twitter to analyze the whole thing and offer their belief that perhaps the Prime Minister had even prepared in advance.\nHe shut that shit down. Trudeau wasn't going to allow him to swing his arm wildly all over the place. I honestly wonder if he prepped for it https://t.co/YLNNwrytkU\n— Shaun King (@ShaunKing) February 13, 2017 Trudeau really was not gonna budge on that handshake.\n\"Not today, bih.\"\n— Imani Gandy (@AngryBlackLady) February 14, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Justin Trudeau spent seven hours practicing his handshake over the weekend\n— Stats Canada (@stats_canada) February 13, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\nUp close this is an amazing handshake. Note how Trudeau is pulling at times and pushing at other times to keep his hand in the same spot. https://t.co/CSr7Oq36bm\n— Stephen Marche (@StephenMarche) February 13, 2017 Notice how Trudeau does the 'alpha shoulder grab' before Trump can do the 'alpha rip his arm off' handshake. pic.twitter.com/ByGqMfeVFr\n— Greg Hogben (@MyDaughtersArmy) February 13, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below That moment Trump tried to pull that weird handshake bit and Trudeau was like not today, motherf**ker.
