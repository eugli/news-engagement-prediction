Last week Bhavana was sexually assaulted by a few thugs in a running car. Six people including Bhavana's driver Martin have been arrested by the police. After completing the day's shoot, the 'Chithiram Pesudhadi' actress went to the police station in the afternoon and took part in the identification parade of the accused who have been arrested. After the attack on that fateful night, Bhavana has been staying in the house of her friend and actress Remya Nambeesan's home and she has been going to medical treatment and police inquiry sessions from there. When the young and energetic actress entered the shooting spot on Saturday, the entire crew members including Prithviraj stood up and clapped in a show of honour for her courage and self respect.
