Going forward they can be a dream but what Pep Guardiola has to do is sort out a defence that has difficulty soaking up the pressure that inevitably comes in all games. On Sunday it nearly cost them and fielding Fernandinho at right-back is a telling sign of Guardiola’s issues with the rearguard. Given the forward riches of Raheem Sterling, Kevin De Bruyne, Sergio Agüero, Gabriel Jesus and Leroy Sané, if City finish as runners-up, as now seems possible, the head coach has to target a left- and right-back plus at least one centre-back this summer or next season City will again fall short. Jamie Jackson \n• Agüero casts doubt over future but club not keen to sell 7) Fonte suggests a change of tack at West Ham has worked \n“José Fonte baby, José Fonte, wooah.” That was the refrain, alongside a less charitable one about Dimitri Payet, from the West Ham fans at the end of their victory over Southampton . Of course, it was largely meant to rile the home support who had enjoyed the Portuguese’s reliable defending for seven years. But it was also recognition that here the January signing, after an uncomfortable debut against Manchester City, slotted into Slaven Bilic’s setup, as did another new signing, Robert Snodgrass. After the match Bilic described Fonte, born in Penafiel, as a British player. “Of course he’s Portuguese, but he’s played in League One,” West Ham’s manager said. “In every league, but especially in this league, it’s important to have the core of homegrown players. That’s the reason we signed that quality, that’s why we opted for them.” Bilic spent his money in the summer window on foreign talent, few of whom adapted to the league and the Hammers’ on-field identity was visibly affected. The Payet saga appears to have prompted a change of tack, and on Saturday it worked. Paul MacInnes \n• Will deadline day signings be key for relegation strugglers? 8) Boro need their new recruits to go on a goal spree \nPatrick Bamford has never had much impact on the Premier League despite loan spells at Crystal Palace, Norwich City and Burnley. Nor has Rudy Gestede, although at least he showed at Aston Villa that his aerial power can bother defences. Middlesbrough need at least one of those January recruits – both signed on permanent transfers at a cost approaching £12m for the pair – to go on a freakish goal spree because, despite having some admirable qualities, it is going to be very difficult for Aitor Karanka’s side to defend their way out of trouble if the team continue scoring at a rate of 0.79 goals per Premier League game. They need that goal spree to start soon because Boro, one point above the relegation zone, face the most daunting run-in of any struggling side, with their final six matches including fixtures against Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool.
