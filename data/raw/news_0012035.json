McKay Jr., attorney for landlord Brian Strauss, whose family owns the building at 1572 N. Milwaukee in Wicker Park, which the Double Door has occupied since June 1994. \n“On Aug. 15, 2016, Judge Hambright entered an order of possession in favor of the landlord. Judge Hambright was kind enough to stay that order to Dec. 31, 2016, to give Double Door more than four months to get their affairs in order,” McKay said. \n“On Oct. 31, after Double Door indicated they would appeal, Judge Hambright ordered Double Door to post an appeal bond within 30 days from Nov. 30, 2016. Double Door violated that order. They never posted the appeal bond,” McKay said. \nThe club, which has hosted bands the likes of the Rolling Stones and Smashing Pumpkins over its 23 years, had a “No Trespassing” sign on the door Monday afternoon. \nOn Monday evening, the roll-down doors were locked in place at the iconic club, secured with shiny new padlocks. The triple-bill of Wulfpac, Dumb Vision and No Men had been moved a few blocks south, to the Emporium Arcade Bar. A manager there declined to comment on the venue change. \nCalls to attorney Cary Schiff, who had represented Double Door’s co-owners through December, went unreturned. In August, owner Sean Mulroney had seemed confident an agreement could be reached, and nostalgic for the rougher scene of Bucktown decades ago. Mulroney and co-owner Joe Shanahan declined to comment on Monday. \nThe co-owners did however rebut McKay’s statements on what led to the eviction. They said they would issue a statement Tuesday. “The landlord and his attorney have substantively misrepresented the facts. We will be issuing a release to rectify this tomorrow,” Mulroney said. \nMeanwhile, the club’s website and social media pages on Monday continued to advertise band appearances booked all the way through the end of April. “The Legal Immigrants” is the last scheduled act, booked for April 27. \nDouble Door’s social media pages were filled with comments from fans lamenting the turn of events and sharing their favorite memories. \n“And so it happens. Thank you for the memories,” one fan posted. \n“R.I.P. Double Door! Many great shows over the years,” another wrote. \nAnother posted: “Thank you Double Door & Staff for making a mark that will never be forgotten!” \nStrauss and his father, Harry Strauss, began eviction efforts in November 2015, alleging club owners had failed to give proper notice that they intended to renew their lease in October 2015. \nLandlord and tenant couldn’t reach agreement on a new rent for the 550-capacity, 5,000-square-foot space Double Door was leasing for $22,000 a month. Strauss had sought to increase that to $33,000, noting soaring rents and property values in a neighborhood that has gentrified over the years. \nWhile fighting the eviction, Double Door owners also had been investigating a move to a site in Logan Square: the Logan Square State and Savings Bank building at 2551 N. Milwaukee Ave. \nUnder a page of the club’s website titled, “Support DD in Logan,” the owners write: “We would sincerely like your help and support before we begin restoring the beautiful and historic Logan Square State and Savings Bank building. We want to continue supporting music and culture in Chicago with our diverse and vibrant programming. We are committed to being great neighbors and a positive cultural addition to the Logan Square neighborhood. Thank you so much for your attention to this matter, as Double Door continues to advocate for local businesses and residents in the 32nd ward.” \nDart’s spokeswoman, Sophia Ansari, said that office received no orders to further stay the eviction enforcement, so sheriff’s deputies arrived at 9:30 a.m. to enforce the court order, leaving at about 11:25 a.m., after locks were changed on the building. \nThe Chicago-based Bassel and the Supernaturals were scheduled to play a CD release party at the Double Door on Feb. 24, but band leader Bassel Almadani said “nothing is final yet,” but wouldn’t elaborate on his discussions Monday with club owners. \nTickets for their show are still on sale, and Almadani said they’re hoping they can play the gig. \n“It’s such a cool spot with an incredible history when it comes to music,” he said.
