Peter Sagan alone brought enough WorldTour points to the Pro-Continental outfit to confirm WorldTour status for the German team in 2017, but the World Champion commands a high price and it is rumoured Specialized contributed to the costs of bringing the Slovakian to the team. Related Articles Tour Down Under: Sagan-inspired McCarthy steals final day podium Whilst Peter Sagan has a range of custom painted Specialized framesets to choose from, Jay McCarthy rides on the team issue S-Works Tarmac. Although the team frames aren't as eye catching as Peter Sagan's unique designs, the predominantly black frames could be considered one of the classier designs in the WorldTour peloton. Turquoise pinstripe detailing on the frames tubing and forks is complimented with metallic fleck in the black paint and contrasts with the bold white decals. The Australian rides a compact 52cm frame and is paired with a 106mm stem and 400mm handlebars, both supplied by PRO components, as it the seat post. The standard 172.5mm crankset, 53-39T chainrings and 11-28T Dura-Ace cassette makes up the Shimano Dura-Ace 9070 groupset and is paired with a 4iiii powermeter. The Bora-Hansgrohe mechanics expect the Dura-Ace 9100 series groupsets to arrive in time for the spring Classics. \nCeramicSpeed provide both the headset and bottom bracket and is a brand becoming more and more prominent in the WorldTour peloton. \nSpecialized provide the S-Works Romin Evo saddle and the Roval CLX 50mm carbon wheels are paired with S-Works Turbo tubular tyres. \nSwipe or click through the gallery above to see more of the Australian's bike.
