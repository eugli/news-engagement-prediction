Close Program prompts 'white only' dater to go out with a Muslim UP NEXT VIDEO SBS program “Date My Race” saw a Victorian tradie date a Muslim woman after he revealed he only picked white girls on Tinder. Program prompts 'white only' dater to go out with a Muslim \nAppearing on SBS program Date My Race, Raymond, a tradie from Victoria, said he would never date an Indian woman and would only try and match with white people on Tinder. \n“Some people find it very racist,” he said. \n“To me it could be a little bit racist, but a preference is a preference. If I like a Holden I'll buy a Holden not a Ford.” Raymond and Rita hit it off despite his insistence that he would only ever date white women. Source: SBS \nRaymond was forced to eat his words when he found himself a potential a new girlfriend and it didn’t quite match the description of his perfect woman – Pamela Anderson during her Baywatch prime. \nSparks flew after he was sent on a date with Muslim woman, Rita. \n“I've gotta step out of my comfort zone and explore other races and other cultures, the love of my life may not be white,” he told Rita. \n“You may end up all on your own, drinking your one drink and eating your one pie.” The pair said they would definitely like to see more of each other in the future. Source: SBS \nMeanwhile, Asian guest Alexander Montgomery wasn’t quite as open minded. \nThe 42 year old said he would only date white men because “nothing else seems right”. \n“To me white people are the epitome of class and the gold standard of desirability,” he said. \n“I really feel the white race is the superior one today. I only date white men.” Alexander Montgomery was a little more stuck in his ways and said an 18 year relationship with a white male made him realise \"white was the superior race\".
