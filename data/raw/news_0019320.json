According to whale rescue organisation Project Jonah, 416 whales were found stranded at Farewell Spit – 75% of which had already died by the time the stranding was discovered. View photos Rescue – hundreds of volunteers have been helping try to save the stranded whales (Picture: Facebook/Project Jonah) More More than 500 volunteers turned out to help keep the whales calm and comfortable until an effort to ‘refloat’ them at high tide. New Zealand’s Department of Conservation (DOC) said more more than 100 whales had been refloated on the high tide on Friday morning, with 50 successfully swimming in the bay but 80-90 getting stranded on the beach again.

Free WiFi is on its way to Mount Everest It said the situation would be checked on Saturday morning and there would be another attempt to refloat any remaining stranded whales, but work would not be done overnight as it can be dangerous for people to be close to the whales in the dark. Andrew Lamason, Operations Manager Takaka, paid tribute to the work done by Project Jonah, which calls itself the emergency service for stranded dolphins and whales.

In 1918, 1,000 whales were stranded on the Chatham Islands and 450 were beached in Auckland in 1985.
