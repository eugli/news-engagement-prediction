Source: Youtube/VideosSubs HD Katy Perry's Grammys live mic feed leaked \nIn the footage, the 32-year-old's raw sound can be heard, minus the backing track that was played during the performance, and fans have been quick to point out that it sounds like a very different Katy. \nWhile the singer is known for her powerful vocals and killer ballads, in the video she sounds uncharacteristically off-pitch, struggling to catch her breath at some points. It may not be the best day for Katy Perry after audio has been leaked of her live mic vocals during last week's Grammys performance of her new song Chained to the Rhythm.

There are moments the singer is heard trying to catch her breath, and a little screech or two can be sensed when she tries to hit those high notes. Source: Getty \nIn New York, Vanity Fair reported that only six people showed up to Brooklyn’s McCarren Park to listen to the song, including a guy who is “more of a Beyoncé fan if I had to pick.” Oh, dear. \nMeanwhile, in San Francisco, the ball was moved by Katy’s record label because of permit issues, meaning only three people managed to locate it and listened to the song. Cringe! \nOther tweets showed the balls looking a little lonely in various international locations. \nBut it seems that fans who did bother to show up have no regrets. “It’s so good!” tweeted one fan about the single. “You’re unstoppable!” Earlier this month, audio was leaked of Lady Gaga's live mic feed during her halftime performance at the Super Bowl. Source: Getty \nAnother Twitter user posted: “[The song] was amazing! Worth waiting in traffic for an hour and a half.” \nWith the song co-written by Aussie genius Sia and produced by Swedish maestro Max Martin, the song does have all the makings of a banger. \nMeanwhile Katy is not the first star to be at the centre of such a situation in recent weeks. \nEarlier this month, audio was leaked of Lady Gaga's live mic feed during her halftime performance at the Super Bowl.
