(Reuters) With the increasing popularity of Snapchat among teens, millennials and advertisers, WhatsApp , owned by Facebook Inc will now be providing an all-new feature, Status, which apparently resembles almost exactly as that of Snapchat’s. The WhatsApp Status tool will now let its user share photos, videos and animated GIFs with other users. While WhatsApp introduces the new feature now, Snapchat had a similar feature called Live Stories since 2014. Facebook had been eyeing to introduce the feature since long and in August last year, Facebook’s Instagram launched a similar feature named Stories. Facebook is also testing to launch the feature for its main mobile app .\nAlike Snapchat, WhatsApp’s Status posts will also be providing options to edit with texts, emojis and finger drawings. Also like Snapchat and Instagram, WhatsApp will let its users send the status posts to all or multiple specific users.\nAlso Watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:12:38.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
