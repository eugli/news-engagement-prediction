No arrests were made. (Matthew Bingley/CBC)\nAubrey said a lot of people, including herself, didn't realize the dispensaries were operating illegally. Though police have said publicly the dispensaries were operating illegally, Aubrey said it was \"deceiving\" to let them open and do business for months before shutting them down.\n'If they raid us again, we'll take it from there.' - Bowe Merchant, on reopening HBB Medical Inc. \"If you have a bunch of stores around the city and nobody's doing anything and they're saying they're legal dispensaries, I mean as the public, it's kind of deceiving.\"\nThe federal government has announced plans to legalize marijuana this spring, but the sale of the drug remains illegal under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act unless it's from a licensed dealer.\nOne woman at the rally said closing a medical marijuana dispensary is like closing a pharmacy.

His father and three employees were arrested when police raided their dispensary HBB Medical Inc., but he reopened the store two weeks ago .\n\"If they raid us again, we'll take it from there,\" he said. \"It's uncertain, but we'll just take it day by day and just hope for the best because we are here for the people.\"\nMarijuana legalization in Canada: What we know and don't know\nWith files from Matthew Bingley", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:52:52.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
