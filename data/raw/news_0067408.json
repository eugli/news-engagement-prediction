In all, 2,400 jobs are expected to be cut. \n\"Lowe’s is engaged in a comprehensive effort to refocus and prioritize resources to ensure we have the right organizational structure in place to support our omnichannel strategy and customers’ expectations,\" the company said in a statement. \nThe goal, it said, is to be \"focused on creating a more agile and efficient operating structure for corporate-based positions that will enable us to be more responsive to customers’ evolving needs.\" \nThe new staffing model was said to result in the reduction of one to two assistant store managers per store. \nAdditionally, some leadership roles in the Customer Support and Distribution Centers were to be consolidated, impacting 37 employees nationwide and about 10% of vice presidents in the corporate office. \nIn total, the reduction impacts less than 1% of the Lowe's workforce, or roughly 2,400 employees. \nMarketing experts believe Lowe's is trying to better compete with rival Home Depot. \n\"It is always difficult to make decisions like these that affect our people, but sometimes they are necessary as we build for the future and meet the evolving needs of consumers,\" said Karen Cobb, manager of corporate public relations. \nCobb said that the company would be providing the affected employees with a transition package including severance pay, outplacement resources and other support.
