The offer includes a year worth of pies, according to The Independent. \nThe chain seems very serious about it, too. Morrisons’ Chief Pie Buyer Tessa Callaghan explained the offer to the Independent, replete with the requisite awful pie and soccer puns. Sutton's cult hero sacked 0:38 \n“We’re always looking for the best talent to taste our pies and make sure they hit the back of the net. Wayne’s performance last night sets him apart as one of the country’s most famous pie connoisseurs. We were really impressed by his commitment to pie eating, and we understand that a good pie is the best way to warm up for any occasion, even if it is the biggest night of your football career.” \nIt remains to be seen if Shaw takes Morrisons up on the offer, or if he’s going to wait and hold up for a move to a bigger-named supermarket chain. Getting Tesco and Sainsbury’s into a bidding war would be a huge boon for Shaw. \nEither way, when fate closes the door on and opportunity, it opens a window. And this window’s not even a drive-thru!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:57:32.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
