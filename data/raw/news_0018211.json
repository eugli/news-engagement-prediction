(Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) \nAfter hearing more than an hour of arguments from attorneys for Washington state and the Justice Department over whether to reverse a stay of President Trump's immigration restrictions, Judge Michelle Friedland of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said the court would come to a decision \"as soon as possible.\" \nLegal experts said they expected to hear from the court within days. An earlier news release from the court said that \"a ruling is not expected to come down today\" but would \"probably\" be issued this week. \nIn addition to oral arguments and answers to questions the attorneys were asked Tuesday, the court has received hundreds of pages of briefs from the chief attorneys in the case, as well as from technology companies, state attorneys general and other parties who have sought to join in.
