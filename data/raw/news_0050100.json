(PTI) Mumbai: Millions voted on Tuesday in Maharashtra to elect 10 major civic bodies, including the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), India’s largest and richest civic body. The election, which will also pick 11 Zilla Parishads and 118 Panchayat Samitis, is widely seen as a referendum on Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. \nBy close of balloting, an estimated 50 per cent of Mumbai’s 9.2 million (92 lakh) electorate had voted. Early voters included political leaders as well as Bollywood actors. \nThe country’s commercial capital and the richest civic body has generally recorded a dismal voter turnout. But the encouraging turnout prompted Fadnavis to tweet: “Thank you Mumbai for the record voting percentage and ... for participating in festival of democracy!” \nThis is the first time the fate of a state government could rest on the outcome of a municipal election, given the bitterness between the BJP and Shiv Sena in the run up to the polls. \nAn aggressive Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray has put the BJP government “on notice period” and said he would decide whether to continue the state-level alliance after the results on Thursday. \nSince Nationalist Congress Party President Sharad Pawar has ruled out support in such an eventuality and predicted mid-term assembly polls, the Fadnavis government will be reduced to a minority. \nFor the BJP, the election is a virtual mid-term report-card on its much-bandied issue of transparency and clean governance. \nControlled by the Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for four terms, the BMC has a budget of Rs 37,052 crore for the current year (2016-17) catering to a population of around 18.30 million. \nIn comparison, neighbouring Goa’s budget last year was around Rs 14,700 crore. \nVoting was also conducted in other nine civic bodies (besides Mumbai) -- Thane, Ulhasnagar, Nashik, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Solapur, Amravati, Akola and Nagpur. \nA generous dose of glamour, glitz and power play was visible in Mumbai at the 7,304 booths to elect 227 BMC corporators from among 2,275 candidates. \nEarly voters included Sharad Pawar, his daughter Supriya Pawar, Uddhav and wife Rashmi Thackeray and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena President Raj and wife Sharmila Thackeray. \nChief Minister Fadnavis and his wife Amruta voted in Nagpur. So did union minister Nitin Gadkari and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. \nAmong the Bollywood personalities who voted—and asked everyone to vote too—were Rekha, Hema Malini, Prem Chopra, Kamini Kaushal, Shah Rukh Khan, Ranveer Singh, Anushka Sharma, Shraddha Kapoor, John Abraham, Vivek Oberoi, Arshad Warsi and Shreyas Talpade, renowned poet Gulzar and filmmaker Subhash Ghai. \nSeveral teleserial actors and Marathi film stars too exercised their franchise. \nSome like BJP state spokesperson Shania N.C. and actor Varun Dhawan could not vote as their names were missing from the voters list. \nAn electorate of 3.77 crore has put the seal on the fate of 17,331 candidates for 5,512 seats, including 1,268 in 10 municipal corporations, 2,956 in 11 Zilla Parishads and 1,288 seats in 118 Panchayat Samitis in the second and final phase of the polling. \nThe results shall be declared on Thursday.
