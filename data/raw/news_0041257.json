That’s why I called it a commonsense approach. \n“If we don’t get an agreement, we’ll continue like nothing happened. But I’m hopeful it will be a fruitful exercise.” \nRotimi Oyedepo, counsel to the EFCC, said he was not aware of any negotiations with the First Bank chief. \nHe described Mr. Adeogun-Philips’ applications as “strange” and an attempt to stop the judge from delivering his judgment. \n“It is alien in our legal system for your Lordship to allow his judgment to be arrested in a matter already slated for judgement,” said Mr. Oyedepo. \n“He talked about settlement. I’m before your Lordship today, I’ve not heard of any settlement. My employer has not given me any information about any discussion. \n“I urge my Lord to strike out the application.” \nAfter adjourning for three hours, the judge struck out the application and proceeded to read his judgment. \nMr. Hassan said nobody showed cause as to why the N23.4 billion and $5 million could not be forfeited to the federal government and gave an order for their “final forfeiture.” \nHe also said the bank executive’s claim that the EFCC misled the court to grant the January 6 interim forfeiture did not hold water. \nThe judge further stated that the respondent could not prove his claim that he was coerced into agreeing to refund N5 billion, and later N80 million within one week. \n“The second respondent voluntarily returned N9.08 billion being proceeds of illegal activity without coercion,” said Mr. Hassan. \nI hereby order the final forfeiture of N23.4 billion and $5 million being unclaimed properties to the federal government of Nigeria.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T21:47:54.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
