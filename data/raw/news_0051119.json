Vote for who you think is deserving of the weekly honor, as many times as you want, until Saturday afternoon. Here's how last week's voting went down. \nJonah Pemberton, La Salle Prep boys basketball : The senior guard twice rescued the Falcons from apparent defeat during Tuesday's game against Parkrose. His layup with 2.5 seconds left in regulation made it 64-64, and his buzzer-beating three-pointer at the end of the first overtime evened things again at 78-78. Pemberton scored eight of his 40 points in the second overtime to help La Salle Prep pull out a thrilling 90-89 win. \nIsaac Bonton, Parkrose boys basketball : The Broncos superstar added his name to the short list of Oregon's 50-point performances Tuesday when he went off for 52 in a 90-89 loss to La Salle Prep. Bonton scored all 11 of his team's points in the second overtime session, but Parkrose came up just short against the fifth-ranked Falcons. \nGeno West, Jefferson boys basketball : West had his best performance of an all-around stellar senior season Tuesday against Franklin, scoring 53 points in the Democrats' 110-63 victory. It's tied for the eighth-highest single-game scoring output in Portland Interscholastic League boys basketball history. \nTayler LyDay, Benson girls basketball : LyDay was the biggest star in the Techsters' latest big win. The sophomore guard recorded 22 points, eight rebounds, six steals, two assists and four blocked shots as Benson went on the road Monday and crushed No. 2 Clackamas 66-43. \nVan Mathias, Beaverton boys swimming: The junior won two events in the 6A meet, breaking the OSAA championship record in one, while becoming the first Beavers swimmer to win a state swim title in 24 years. Mathis won the 100 butterfly in 48.61 seconds, breaking the all-classes OSAA record of 48.72, set by Aloha’s Neil O’Halloran in 2011. He also won the 100 backstroke, giving him Beaverton’s first swim titles since Casey Harmon won the 100 butterfly and 200 freestyle in 1993. \nEmily Cook, Jesuit girls swimming : Cook is the new OSAA record-holder in the girls 100 backstroke after swimming to victory in 53.71 at the Class 6A girls swimming state meet at Mt. Hood Community College in Gresham. Cook also finished first in the 100 butterfly and was part of the Crusaders' winning 200 medley relay team. \nCasey McEuen, Lebanon boys swimming : The junior set 5A state meet records in winning two events. He won the 50-yard freestyle in 20.66 seconds to break the meet record of 20.8 set by Summit’s Tommy Brewer in 2014, then repeated as champion in the 100 freestyle, winning in 45.57, breaking Brewer’s record of 46.04, set in 2012. \nElliyana Ferrin, Bend girls swimming : Ferrin's time of 54.91 set a Class 5A meet record in the girls 100 backstroke. She also gained first-place medals in the 50 freestyle, 200 medley relay and 200 freestyle relay. \nKylie Warren, Tigard girls basketball : The senior guard scored 21 points to lead the Tigers to a come-from-behind, 63-55 overtime win at Canby that clinched at least a share of the Three Rivers League title. Tigard trailed by four points with 47 seconds left in regulation, but Warren scored on a drive and added two free throws with 10 seconds left to force overtime. Jamie Stone, Centennial girls swimming : The 6-foot senior won the 50 and 100-yard freestyle races at the Class 6A championships, making her the first girl to be a four-time champion in two events at the big-school meet. The Arizona-bound Stone holds the OSAA meet record in the 100 freestyle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:32:59.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
