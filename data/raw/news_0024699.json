Follow Nicki for more daily updates on Twitter .\nNow that Terrell Davis has finally made the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which former Broncos player is most likely to get in next? I know there’s a lot of talk for John Lynch and Brian Dawkins, but do you think Steve Atwater will be wearing the gold jacket one day?\n— Steve Johnson, Denver\nSteve: You’re going to get more than you bargained for with this answer, but here goes: Atwater and Karl Mecklenburg should and likely will get there. Brian Dawkins made it to the final 10 in his first year of eligibility, a sign he has a leg up and could be in Canton quite soon. John Lynch was denied entry after four years of being finalist, but he, too, made the final 10 this year and surely isn’t far.\nThe next Bronco to get in should be Pat Bowlen , as a contributor. Bowlen was snubbed yet again for the Class of 2017, losing out to Paul Tagliabue, the former NFL commissioner who oversaw tremendous growth for the league but who downplayed concussions in the mid-90s (he labeled them as “one of those pack-journalism issues”), and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, the ultimate businessman who turned the Cowboys into a $4.2 billion franchise with three Super Bowl titles, but also comes with a controversial track record. There’s good reason the resumes of Tagliabue and Jones were debated the longest by the Hall of Fame selection committee Saturday in Houston.\nBowlen, however, was not only instrumental in expanding the league, with his push for international play, his role on nine different NFL committees and his help in brokering a then-record $18 million TV rights deal in 1998. Bowlen is a key reason we watch Sunday Night Football and why NFL Network exists. And while others like Jones covet the spotlight, Bowlen went out of his way to avoid it — to avoid meddling and to avoid taking the focus off his players.\nThat may be hurting his HOF chances now since many outside of Denver aren’t as familiar with him and his ownership record. But the numbers don’t lie. On the field, the Broncos’ accomplishments since Bowlen purchased the team in 1984 are simply astounding: 322 regular-season wins (most in the NFL since ’84); a .612 winning percentage, the third-best by any American pro sports team; 13 divisional titles; 18 playoff berths; seven Super Bowl appearances; three Super Bowl titles and only five losing seasons; among many others.\nOff the field, the comments from players and coaches say it all, and they often say the same thing: Bowlen wanted to win at all costs, he protected his players and he allowed his coaches to coach.\nFrom John Elway : “He always put the team in front of the money. He’d do anything he could and spend what he needed to spend to give us an opportunity to win football games. As a player and a GM, you could be in better situation when it comes down to an owner.”\nAnd Mike Shanahan: “He was very disciplined. Just an unbelievable owner that you would love to work for, and he did all the little things that gave you a chance to win that people don’t realize.”\nAnd Rod Smith: “The owner usually only shows up when there’s a problem. Pat was always around, he’d let you do your job. He let coach Shanahan coach the team. He let John Elway do his thing. To me, that’s what made the organization great because the owner isn’t in the way. He’s not in the spotlight, but he handles things and makes sure things got taken care of.”\nTake Our Poll And Gary Kubiak: “‘Mr. B’ is the greatest owner in sports. I had a chance to play for him, coach for him and be a head coach for him. It’s been a big part of my life, a majority of my NFL life. … I love ‘Mr. B.’”\nAnd the list goes on. Mr. B belongs in the Hall.\nRelated Articles Mike McCoy’s vision for Broncos?

I feel he would be better suited being in more of a power scheme, plus a year off to recover from nagging injuries.\n—Matt Russo, Childers, Australia\nMatt: Don’t think so. He hasn’t played since the Broncos released him last March and he was dealing with a number of injuries in his final season.\nShould the Broncos go after Colin Kaepernick now that he’s a free agent?\n—Detrick, New Orleans\nDetrick: He’s not a free agent yet. He can’t opt out of his deal until March 2, and the latest report out of San Francisco says he hasn’t made up his mind. Regardless, he didn’t want to take a paycut to vie for the starting job last year so the Broncos drafted Paxton Lynch . Vance Joseph and Mike McCoy on Tuesday reaffirmed their commitment to developing Trevor Siemian and Lynch, so I don’t see them circling back with Kaepernick. And I don’t see Kaepernick being interested without the promise of a starting job.", "external_links": ["http://www.forbes.com/teams/dallas-cowboys/", "https://twitter.com/RickGosselin9/status/828024462280900608", "http://www.twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "http://polldaddy.com/poll/9659064"], "published": "2017-02-09T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:22:45.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
