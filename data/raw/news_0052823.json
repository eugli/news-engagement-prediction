Image copyright AFP Image caption A scene from the video showing Sgt Azaria raising his rifle at the wounded Abdul Fatah al-Sharif \nIt showed Azaria cocking his gun and firing at the head of Sharif, who was lying apparently incapacitated on the ground after being shot and wounded following the stabbing attack. \nThe military court which tried Azaria dismissed his claim that he had acted out of fear that Sharif might have been wearing an explosive vest. \nThe killing occurred amid a wave of attacks by Palestinians that had killed 29 Israelis over the preceding five months. \nFollowing the incident military chiefs and the prime minister came under fire from right-wing sections of society - including members of Mr Netanyahu's cabinet - for criticising Azaria's actions. \nMr Netanyahu later telephoned Azaria's father to offer reassurance.
