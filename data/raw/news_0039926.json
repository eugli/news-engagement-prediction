What we know about the plastic £10 Coming soon - the new plastic tenner (Photo: Reuters) \"The £10 paper banknote is the oldest Bank of England banknote design in circulation and therefore the security features require updating to take advantage of developments in technology,\" the Bank said in a recent paper.\nProduction of the new £10 polymer note began last August and the Bank has already printed 275 million notes, but they're not quite ready to launch yet.\nThe new note will be smaller than the current one - but larger than the new fiver. The size ratios will be the same as the ones between the old paper fiver and paper tenner.\nIt will be made of the same materials as the new five pound note too. And, yes, that means it will also have traces of animal fat in it .\nThe Bank of England has is currently looking into ways to make its new notes tallow-free. Saying it will \"work closely with banknote polymer suppliers to determine what alternatives might be available\".\nRead More New £1 coins ALREADY selling for hundreds on eBay - and they're not even out in the UK yet But as hundreds of millions of them had already been printed, as things stand they will launch with tallow traces in them.\nBanknote equipment manufactures have started to work adapting macines to fit the new tenner, and firms have started to place orders for key components, such as new ATM parts to accommodate the revised sized note.\nThe three Scottish issuing banks are also printing their next £10 notes on polymer - they will be released between September and October next year.\nThe Bank of England that we can expect the new polymer £10 note in September 2017.\nAfter this, a new plastic £20 note will be released in 2020 - there are currently no plans to issue a plastic £50.\nRead More Valuable coins: Have you got any of these?

The new £10 will feature Jane Austen (Photo: Birmingham Mail) Jane Austen will feature on the upcoming polymer note, as confirmed by Bank of England governor Mark Carney at a 2013 press conference.\nThere are currently no women on the back of English banknotes, something that caused some controversy when Winston Churchill was announced as the featured figure on the new fiver.\nAusten's presence on the new £10 note was one of the first things announced by Carney after taking up his position.\n“Jane Austen certainly merits a place in the select group of historical figures to appear on our banknotes,\" the Bank of England governor said.\n\"Her novels have an enduring and universal appeal and she is recognised as one of the greatest writers in English literature.\n\"As Austen joins Adam Smith, Boulton and Watt, and in future, Churchill, our notes will celebrate a diverse range of individuals who have contributed in a wide range of fields.”\nThe new tenner will also be smaller then the paper one (Photo: Getty Images) More features of the new £10 note Features of the design on the reverse of the Jane Austen note will include:\nThe Quote: – “I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!” from Pride and Prejudice (Miss Bingley, Chapter XI).\nPortrait of Jane Austen. Commissioned by James Edward Austen Leigh (Jane Austen’s nephew) in 1870, adapted from an original sketch of Jane Austen drawn by her sister, Cassandra Austen.\nAn illustration of Miss Elizabeth Bennet undertaking “The examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her”– from a drawing by Isabel Bishop (1902-1988).\nThe image of Godmersham Park. Godmersham was home of Edward Austen Knight, Jane Austen's brother. Jane Austen visited the house often and it is believed that it was the inspiration for a number of her novels.\nJane Austen’s writing table – the central design in the background is inspired by the 12 sided writing table, and writing quills, used by Jane Austen at Chawton Cottage.\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch Next David Challinor leaves Wrexham Magistrates Court Watch this video again Watch Next Mum-to-be's surprise proposal in shop window on V 0:35 CCTV of moment James Arthur was glassed in packed 0:43 Fitness champion knifed more than a dozen times a 2:19 Maradonna warns reporter 'if I hit you, you won't 0:43 Footage from the scene where tree surgeon died in 0:11 We visit the Black Country on the second stop ret 3:18 Woman who planned to fly 3,200 miles to marry 'lo 1:25 Video will play in Share this video Watch Next Money Newsletter Follow @MirrorMoney Subscribe to our Money Jane Austen Bank of England New five pound note", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2714/4221396001_5324581584001_5324579118001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/230/4221396001_5324203007001_5324206718001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2602/4221396001_5324331107001_5324306636001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3254/4221396001_5324233364001_5324238432001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorMoney", "http://brightcove04.o.brightcove.com/4221396001/4221396001_5119507320001_5119503982001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove04.o.brightcove.com/4221396001/4221396001_5156965048001_5156956504001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3574/4221396001_5324437027001_5324426540001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2318/4221396001_5324032680001_5324017197001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1298/4221396001_5324399395001_5324377997001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1814/4221396001_5324218636001_5324186660001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/350/4221396001_5324261716001_5324250619001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3810/4221396001_5324199733001_5324190091001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/934/4221396001_5324322042001_5324312498001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3634/4221396001_5324133968001_5322967285001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2874/4221396001_5324452696001_5324435938001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/438/4221396001_5324502841001_5324478900001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrormoneysaving", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1054/4221396001_5324560532001_5324536623001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/418/4221396001_5324257322001_5324243983001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2017-02-16T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:25:35.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
