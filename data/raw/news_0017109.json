Fifa and Donald Trump would be a self-regarding match made in heaven | Barry Glendenning Read more \nThe Argentinian great’s career peaked as he led his country to victory at the 1986 World Cup finals in Mexico but he also suffered arguably his lowest point when he was sent home for failing a drugs test at the 1994 tournament. \nMaradona said in a post on his official Facebook page: “Yes, it’s now official. I can finally fulfil one of the dreams of my life, to work for a clean and transparent Fifa , with people who love football. Thanks to everyone who encouraged me to face this new challenge.” \nFifa has been mired in scandal in recent years with former president Sepp Blatter serving a six-year ban from all football activity over a payment made to former Uefa president Michel Platini. \nThe organisation’s new president, Gianni Infantino, is keen to establish closer links between Fifa and some of the game’s greatest players with former Holland star Marco van Basten now its chief officer for technical development.
