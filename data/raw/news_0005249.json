The campus is expected to be functional by the end of 2019. \n\n“The new facility is going to help in consolidating our entire workforce in Bengaluru,“ said Shailender Kumar, MD, Oracle India. \n\n\n\n“It includes existing employees and potential new recruits. It is the second largest facility Oracle has, outside of its headquarters in San Francisco, California,“ he added. \n\nThe campus will have facilities spread over 3 lakh square feet of area. By establishing the SEZ, the company is keen to deepen its footprint in software service exports. \n\nOracle runs eight software development centres in India including global centres at Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Noida, and Thiruvananthapuram and, provides software development, consultancy services, marketing and IT enabled services. \n\nThe Redwood City-headquartered software giant earned $34 billion in global revenues last year, while its India operations contributed a little more than $1 billion. Karnataka's Industries & Infrastructure Minister RV Deshpande described Oracle as a reputed multinational which has been operating in Benglauru for a long time. The government is providing all the support to the company make new investments and add jobs. \n\nWhen Oracle Corporation chief executive officer Safra A Catz visited India in February last year, she discussed plans to invest $400 million in Bengaluru with PM Narendra Modi. \n\nAs per the information available, Oracle India will invest Rs 218 crore into the new Bengaluru facility, the rest will come from the parent company. That Oracle wants to consolidate and grow in Bengaluru reaffirms the city provides the best investment climate and the holistic ecosystem for technology companies, said DV Prasad, additional chief secretary, commerce and industries depart ment, Karnataka. \n\n“When we announced the investment in February 2016, it was our third wave of investment in India, as an expression of how advanced the economy has become,“ said Kumar. \n\n“In the early years, we invested in support and back-office, in the middle years we set up product development centers and acquired iFlex. Previous investments were about serving global customers from India. This current investment is about growing the India economy from within India,“ he added.
