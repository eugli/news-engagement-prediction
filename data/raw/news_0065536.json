(Photo: Rob Schumacher/The Republic) \nHere’s a profile in courage: A Texas congressman hid behind Gabby Giffords as he explained this week why he couldn’t possibly meet with constituents.\nRep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, pointed to the 2011 shooting of then Rep. Gabrielle Giffords as a reason he isn’t holding a town hall during this week’s break.\n\"At this time there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology, some even being paid, who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety,\" Gohmert said earlier this week. \"Threats are nothing new to me and I have gotten my share as a felony judge.

By Monday morning my offices were open to the public. Ron Barber — at my side that Saturday, who was shot multiple times, then elected to Congress in my stead — held town halls. It's what the people deserve in a representative.\"\nGohmert said he could communicate with constituents through tele-town hall meetings.\nGiffords, meanwhile, continues to appear in public despite having been shot in the head and nearly killed. These days, she’s taking a stand to enact sane gun measures – the sort of thing that surely could make her a target.\nAnd yet, there she is, regularly out in public..\n\"To the politicians who have abandoned their civic obligations, I say this: Have some courage. Face your constituents. Hold town halls.\"\nSo says the woman who always stands tall to our so-called representatives who ... don't.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:33:10.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
