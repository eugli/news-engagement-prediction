News Group Newspapers Ltd Ian Wright has tested out the playing surface ahead of Arsenal’s trip to Sutton \nWhen you try to pass the ball, it slows it down. \nKeep up to date with ALL the FA Cup news, gossip, transfers and goals plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nSo Arsenal will want to make sure it gets watered to try to slicken it up. \nThe quicker the pitch, the better it will be for Arsenal. \nIt’s Sutton’s choice but Arsenal will certainly ask the question. \nThey won’t have any problem with their grip, though — not from what I went through. \nI wore pimples rather than studs but it wasn’t like the old, rock-hard and bone-dry plastic pitches.

Under-fire Arsene Wenger finally admits he could leave Arsenal THIS season as he faces decision over future \nThis one felt spongy under my feet, really lovely, and you could get a proper grip. \nI didn’t feel in any danger of slipping. It’s certainly one of the better artificial pitches I’ve played on. \nThe only thing I noticed was the bounce was slightly different to what you’d get on grass. \nI wouldn’t say it was abnormal. It’s OK but it does grip slightly more than a normal pitch, spins more and shoots off when that spin digs into the pitch. \nBack in the day when you were drawn away to a lower-division team, it was always the thought in your head that the pitch would be a leveller.

It should work in Arsenal’s favour. Sutton United's Roarie Deacon tells us his Arsenal story and how he cannot wait to meet his old pals Ian Wright checks out the Sutton United players' shooting ability \nFor me, the main reason is that it felt like a really big pitch. \nThat means the longer the game goes on, the more space there will be — and Arsenal will have the extra fitness to take advantage of that. \nI just hope that Arsene Wenger plays some of his real stars — Alexis Sanchez or Mesut Ozil. \nI’m pretty sure he will play a reasonably strong team, with international players, but it’s such a big night for Sutton that it could mean so much for them. \nThey hire out the pitch to local clubs and kids teams — and if the youngsters can say, “I played on the same pitch as Alexis” it would mean so much and inspire them.
