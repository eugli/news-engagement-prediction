If they had scored another 100 runs or so, I think it would have been quite difficult. It helped us a lot that we bowled them out for under 200,\" said De Villiers. \nNiroshan Dickwella fought a lone battled up front, facing 80 deliveries for his 74, which included seven boundaries and was assisted by his captain, Upal Tharanga (31), to give the tourists a good opening stand of 60 off 74 balls before the wheels came off. \n\"We had a very good start with Niroshan (Dickwella) playing well but there was nobody to support him,\" said Tharanga after the match. \nIn fact, the Sri Lankans were decently placed at 115 for three, but then lost their last seven wickets for just 48 runs with Pretorius being the main assassin. \n\"I'm just glad I could contribute to the team today. It was a great performance from the team and the other bowlers backed me up nicely. The movement was good and I am just glad the coin went my way,\" said man-of-the-match Pretorius. MATCH HIGHLIGHTS This video is not available in your region \nThe opening stand was broken by Rabada, who had Tharanga caught by Pretorius on the fine leg boundary, a ball after JP Duminy had dropped Dickwella running back from point. \nPhehlukwayo saw to it that the Sri Lankans were not able to recover from the good start by removing Kusal Mendis (4) and Dinesh Chandimal (4). \nBEES DELAY PLAY \nShortly after Chris Morris (8-0-38-1) had Dhahanjaya de Silva (16) caught by Hashim Amla in the slips, play was interrupted for an hour due to a swarm of bees that invaded the field. \nThe umpires and ground staff tried to remove the insects before taking the players from the field. A bee keeper was called into action to remove the swarm and once play resumed, so did the fall of wickets. \n\"It is something you can't control, whether it be rain or bees. We just had to refocus and the guys did really well,\" said De Villiers. \nOnly Sachith Pathiran (20) gave any form of resistance in the lower order, striking two boundaries off 29 balls as Asela Gunaratne (2), Lahiru Madushanka (0), Suranga Lakmal (0) and Lahiru Kumara (3) all failed to trouble the scorers too much. \nPretorius began by dismissing Wickwella, who edged the seamer to Quinton de Kock behind the stumps, giving the wicketkeeper his 100th ODI victim. \nPretorius then removed Madushanka and Lakmal before Tahir cleaned up the party by bowling Kumara, in a replica of the test dismissal, and them having Pathirana caught by Rabada. \n\"Our batting is our main concern and we have to carry on with the good starts that we are getting,\" added Tharanga. \nLITTLE EFFORT NEEDED \nIn reply, the South Africans began briskly with Amla (34) and De Kock (8) putting on 23 for the first wicket off 25 deliveries before De Kock played Kumara (8-0-49-1) onto his stumps to give the 19-year-old his first ODI wicket. \nAmla and Faf du Plessis (24) looked composed as they added 35 runs for the second wicket but then the South African test captain handed Madushanka (4-0-15-1) his first ODI wicket when he tried to flick the medium-paced bowler through the leg side, only to get a leading edge and be caught by Gunaratne at point. \nDe Villiers then joined Amla and the pair went about their business as they have done over the past 13 years, working the ball around the park with little effort, adding 34 runs off 41 balls before Amla was run out. A good throw from the boundary by Madushanka saw Amla short at the non-striker's end, coming back for a second run. \n\"It was not easy out there as the pitch was two-paced and I never really felt in control, said the South African captain. \nBut De Villiers and Duminy (28 not out) took their side home with an unbeaten stand of 72 off 84 balls to seal the match and the series. \n\"We really wanted to win the series tonight. But we will sit down tonight and have a chat, maybe bring in a few new faces for the game at Newlands,\" ended De Villiers. \nSOUTH AFRICA: HM Amla, Q de Kock (wk), F du Plessis, AB de Villiers (capt), JP Duminy, F Behardien, CH Morris, D Pretorius, AL Phehlukwayo, K Rabada, Imran Tahir \nSRI LANKA: N Dickwella, WU Tharanga (capt), BKG Mendis, LD Chandimal (wk), DM de Silva, DAS Gunaratne, LD Madushanka, SS Pathirana, RAS Lakmal, PADLR Sandakan, CBRLS Kumara Â© MWP ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:47:07.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
