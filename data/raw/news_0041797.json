Sure, you’ve heard of Exeter, Andover, and Dalton. But have you ever wondered where some of the most famous and successful people went to high school? After all, the formative years are indeed just that. Below, we’ve highlighted six schools with especially impressive alumni rosters. Many of those who have achieved prominence are actors—but an even greater share of that group are female performers. So if you want to learn where some of the strongest, most bad-ass women we know and love got their start—keep reading. Beverly Hills High School This school has more than its fair share of famous alumni—blame it on their location advantage. Nora Ephron, Angelina Jolie, and Lenny Kravitz all attended, but for many of us, the outdoor halls of BHH were immortalized by Cher in Clueless. Alicia Silverstone’s iconic character and her best friend Dionne ruled the school, learned some lessons, and provided an in-depth and hilarious tour into the imagined classrooms of Beverly Hills High. But despite this, we’re a bit more intrigued to think about what Nora Ephron might have read—and written—in senior year English. Harvard-Westlake School Another LA institution of pre-college learning, Harvard-Westlake counts actors Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal as alumni. Perhaps the Gyllenhaals' many collective accomplishments (can we all just agree that The Honorable Woman was a little overlooked?) are partially a result of their high school education. Even if not, it's difficult to disagree with the fact that Southern California makes for an idyllic school location. Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School is made up of two separate schools—the High School of Music & Art, and the High School of Performing Arts—that became one in 1961. Between the two, they’ve produced some of the most prominent performers to have worked in the industry. Jennifer Aniston, Nicki Minaj, and Eartha Kitt are all alumnae. But the biggest surprise to look for in a yearbook? Fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, whose early thespian talents were transferred away from the stage. Prince William attended Eton College Photo: Getty Images Eton College Eton has been producing British leaders for centuries, but some of our modern day heartthrobs have also attended this age-old institution. Prince William and Prince Harry are both alums, as well as Tom Hiddleston and Eddie Redmayne. Should Hollywood go and actively scout there from now on? Choate Rosemary Hall On this side of the pond, the Connecticut boarding school is understandably proud that it educated president John F. Kennedy. However, actors Michael Douglas, Paul Giamatti, Glenn Close, and Ali MacGraw all attended as well. Maybe this lends a little insight into how MacGraw was able to nail preppy style so well. The Brearley School New York City is not bereft when it comes to well known (and difficult to get into) schools. And unsurprisingly, the island of Manhattan has educated a fair amount of highly successful people. But the all girls school known as Brearley, located by the East River, counts Kyra Sedgwick and Tea Leoni as alumnae. Oh, and did we mention that Caroline Kennedy and Eva Chen also attended? Strong women all around. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T17:48:46.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
