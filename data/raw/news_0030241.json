This is where I get to speak with the right people. This is where my message needs to get to. My presence and appearance alone set an example,\" she said.\nMs Jones, seen here at the Oktoberfest beer festival in Munich, is well known for her tours of Hamburg's red light district The TV personality, seen here at an anti-AIDS event in 2005, also supports causes including animal rights and anti-racism The fact that some right-wingers would not like to see her enter political life was the very reason for her to do so, she said, adding that it was important not to be intimidated by conservative or right-wing politicians.\nAmong those joining her at Sunday's presidential vote was Frauke Petry, the leader of the anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD).\nThe drag queen previously said she would be happy to meet Ms Petry and \"take a photo with her\".\n\"If I meet her I would say clearly to her that we do not need more hatred in society. The AfD also does not need to be afraid of gays and lesbians. There is no danger there,\" she said.\nDespite being just metres from each other at the ceremony, it not clear whether the pair got the opportunity to speak.\nOlivia Jones could be seen in the background as the AfD's Frauke Petry congratulated Frank-Walter Steinmeier", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14557/production/_94278238_mediaitem94278237.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0BA1/production/_94277920_037844443-1.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/13FD5/production/_94277818_mediaitem94277817.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4751/production/_94275281_mediaitem94275280.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/A917/production/_94278234_mediaitem94277822.jpg", "http://www.saarbruecker-zeitung.de/politik/themen/berlin-Kinderbuecher-Lesben-Schwule;art2825,6375244", "https://www.welt.de/politik/video162014602/Einen-Anti-Trump-wuerde-ich-mir-wuenschen.html", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/B2D1/production/_94277754_mediaitem94277753.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38949530"], "published": "2017-02-12T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:06:20.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
