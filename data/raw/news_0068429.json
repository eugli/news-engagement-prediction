Beauty Destinations You Haven’t Heard Of Yet February 25, 2017 11:00 AM by Rachel Marlowe Photographed by Irving Penn, Vogue , January 2007 While it may seem like the next-level glamour of the Golden Globes cannot possibly be topped, they were simply a warm-up for the most glittering night—and most watched red carpet—of the year: the Academy Awards in Los Angeles. The perfect dress aside, other requirements for Oscar hopefuls include flawless skin from head to toe, artfully executed hair, and a directional manicure—all the better to hold up that statuette with. But top-shelf beauty isn’t just for the Hollywood set. The secret to any big-night prep comes down to having the right black book—knowing whom to call, including names that go a cut deeper than the usual lineup. Here, a look at L.A.’s best rising stars and beauty destinations. THE FACIALISTS: Biba West Hollywood Industry insiders and Hollywood leading ladies like Michelle Monaghan and Emily Blunt have facialist Biba de Sousa’s number on speed dial thanks to her reputation as the town’s go-to fixer when it comes to breakouts caused by on-set hair and makeup reactions. “Entertainers are constantly exposed to an overload of makeup, products, travel, and stress, making them more vulnerable to breakouts,” says de Sousa. She’s assembled a high tech arsenal of solutions for even the most sensitive skin, from an oxygen-infused steam machine and facial cryotherapy device to a green LED light that evens out discoloration left by blemishes and any blotchiness caused by extractions. By appointment estheticunderground.com Kat Rudu Skin Studio After stints at every cult skin-care spot in town from Ole Henriksen to Dr. Lancer, facialist Kat Rudu has finally opened her own treatment space in a discreet, art-filled Venice bungalow, meaning Westsiders no longer have to cross the 405 for one of her signature Jet Set Facials (which incorporate crystal-free dermabrasion, extractions, and lactic acid or fruit enzyme exfoliation, among other customizable options). Rudu, who favors a gentler approach to skin care, advocates a series of regular oxygen infusions and facial cupping sessions in the weeks leading up to a big event to mend broken capillaries, tighten the jaw line, and plump the skin, followed by a good night’s sleep in her Jet Secret Cream Mask for a healthy glow that will last well beyond awards season. By appointment katrudubeauty.com Melanie Simon Following a hiatus of several years, nano-current facial guru Melanie Simon, aka the Electric Esthetician, is back in Los Angeles with a residency at the Streicher sister’s Beverly Hills beauty boutique. Her bespoke treatments—which can last up to two hours—consist of a custom electrical cocktail of up to 20 different waveforms delivered via an assortment of metal paddles and wands, as well her own hand-held ZIIP device, which Simon uses to deliver energy to the cells; lift, sculpt, drain, and erase fine lines; zap away acne and pigmentation; and leave skin glowing. 9278 Civic Center Drive, Beverly Hills THE BROW GENIUS: Dominique Bossavy Maybe she was born with those face-framing brows, or maybe she just had one of Dominique Bossavy’s Micro Color Infusion Brow Treatments. Either way, you would be hard pressed to spot the difference: “It’s hard to tell what’s real and what’s me,” Bossavy says of her sought-after semi-permanent makeup work. Less invasive than microblading and with absolutely zero recovery time, the secret behind her signature fresh, pretty brows lies in the proprietary nano pigments and custom designed pen that allow her to mimic the color, shape, and texture of real—or longed for—brows. By appointment in Los Angeles, New York City, and Paris THE BODY WIZARD: Gina Marí The preponderance of slashes, slits, and cutouts when it comes to red carpet dressing means skin prep doesn’t stop at the neck . . .or even the navel. “You never know what areas of the body your dress is going to expose—whether on purpose or by accident—or even which dress you’re going to wear,” says Marí. Her current weapon of choice is cult skin-care line Circ Cell’s Chirally Correct Peel applied head to toe as an “acid wash” to exfoliate, smooth, and refine the skin without any irritation or redness but rather a radiant, winning glow. 9350 Wilshire Blvd. #204, Beverly Hills THE MASSAGE GURU: Auggie Arsendiga at Caudalie Spa It’s a long walk down the red carpet into the Dolby Theatre, and pulling it off with poise and perfect posture in five-inch heels and a couture gown requires a helping hand. Cue a session with the fashion set’s secret weapon, massage therapist Auggie Arsendiga, who counts Jason Wu, Alexander Wang, and Emma Roberts among his devotees. “Walking is dancing with gravity,” says Arsendiga, who recently made the move to Caudalie’s Venice Beach boutique spa after five years at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. “Massage offers balance and poise in response to gravity assuring a desirable postural alignment so you can confidently step onto the red carpet.\" 1416 Abbot Kinney Blvd., Venice THE MANICURIST: Base Coat Looking for the coolest nontoxic nail parlor in town? Head over to the Arts District in downtown for an appointment at Base Coat nail salon. Get comfortable in one of the African-mud-cloth-upholstered arm chairs, order a Kombucha on tap, and—as the neon light over the entrance suggests—“Treat Yo Self” to a mani-pedi using a shade from its in-house line of 8-Free polishes or 5-Free gels (those in-the-know book in with nail artist Shelly Hill, whose clients include Gwen Stefani and Nicki Minaj). As for the color of the moment? “A robin’s egg blue called Stratosphere,” says co-owner Ali Elman. 704 Mateo Street, Los Angeles THE HAIR THERAPIST: The Private Room Kick things off with a glass of Champagne and a head massage to calm any pre-event jitters. Then, choose from a menu of services that includes everything from gloss treatments to restore shine and vibrancy to colored hair, to reparative L’Oréal ProFiber treatments for hair damaged by hot tools, to clip-in extensions to a quick refresh at the Bang Station. And if you’re seeking inspiration, owner Tina Dizon predicts that this year’s winning look is “sleek, straight, polished hair with zero volume and high shine.” 9414 Brighton Way, Beverly Hills In This Story: Oscars , Los Angeles Recommended For You", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T18:33:14.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
