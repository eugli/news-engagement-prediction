WHEN it comes to picking your SuperCoach team it pays to work out your optimum picks in each position before you get started. \nThat doesn’t just mean focusing on the prime beef. It’s about finding players of high importance for their ability to pay their way as well as score highly. \nThat’s why power rankings are so important and, with players named in order of how valuable they’ll be to the overall picture. \nAs power rankings should be, they’ll be subject to change based on injury and team news between now and team selections. \nIt is impossible to account for every SuperCoach team’s needs, but these power rankings take into account bye coverage, projected price/minutes increases and scoring output to decide between players in cases where 50/50 decisions exist. \nREVEALED: Traps to ruin your SuperCoach season \nIf a player in your current team isn’t named, don’t fret. \nWe will be unveiling our preseason (alternate) players of interest later on in the week, which will highlight some PODs (or players of difference) SuperCoaches might want to incorporate into their side for some high-risk, high-reward outcomes. Storm’s Cameron Smith tops SuperCoach power rankings. Source: Getty Images \nHOOKERS \n1. Cameron Smith ($523,700) \nAveraging significantly more than the next best hooker, the ultra-consistent Storm skipper is a set and forget, even at the outlandish asking price. \n2. Cameron McInnes ($369,400) \nFulfilling a weekly 80 minute role at Paul McGregor’s Dragons translates to a meaningful rise in weekly output. \n3. Jayden Brailey ($122,600) \nThe frontrunner to start in the Sharks’ No.9 jumper (now it’s the post-Mick Ennis era), multiplied by his basement price tag. \n4. Robbie Farah ($346,900) \nPerformance in the Charity Shield suggests he can provide something Souths missed last season. And when Farah’s playing big minutes, the fantasy points pile up. Farah looks set to win the starting No.9 jersey and even when Damien Cook comes on, Farah could keep racking up points from lock. \n5. Josh Hodgson ($417,300) \nWhen quality’s a high priority, but Cam Smith’s out of reach, Hodgson’s the next denominator. \n6. Isaac Luke ($424,100) \nHopes are high Luke can spearhead an improved Warriors outfit, with the additions of coach Stephen Kearney and star half Kieran Foran … plus fend off Jazz Tevaga out of the 17 and into NSW Cup. Looks to have handed back kicking duties to Shaun Johnson though. \n7. Api Koroisau ($349,800 HOK-5/8) \nWhile it’s a bumpy ride, there’s juicy upside. With Matt Parcell now out of the picture, chances are Koroisau evolves into a consistent full-game rake. The question mark is Lewis Brown and Jackson Hastings lurking in the ranks. \n8. Elijah Taylor ($307,100 HOK-2RF) \nComes at a discounted price following last year’s selection struggles at previous club Penrith. \n9. Matt Ballin ($143,600) / Matt McIlwrick ($143,600) \nIf either of these bottom-dollar guys earn a 50+ minute role, there’s cash to be reaped. \n10. Isaac De Gois ($225,800) \nWord is the Eels are playing an 80 minute hooker this season, and IDG’s leading the pre-season race. Sharks front-rower Andrew Fifita. Source: News Corp Australia \nFRONT ROW FORWARDS \n*Note: All dual position front rowers will be covered in the second row section. \n1. Andrew Fifita ($481,900) \nProvides an irresistible combination of base stats and attacking upside. \n2. Felise Kaufusi ($192,600) \nIf he wins the starting right edge position at the Storm, he should be in 100 per cent of serious SuperCoach sides. \n3. Josh Macguire ($387,700) \nWith a move to No.13 and a likely minutes increase, ‘lock’ him in. \n4. Jarrod Wallace ($251,800) \nA move down to the glitter strip ensures a starting role and more work in both attack and defence for this up-and-comer. \n5. George Burgess ($241,800) \nPriced as the ghost of George Burgess, the far more fit and healthy version is subsequently carrying plenty of pre-season hype. \n6. James Tamou ($347,000) \nOn decent coin and looking fit, the Panthers are expecting plenty out of the Blues big bopper … so you should too. \n7. Jesse Bromwich ($436,700) \nThe Kiwi skipper rarely lets anyone down, and after the Storm’s round 12 bye, it’s smooth sailing. \n8. James Graham ($428,400) \nA decent bye schedule and an outstandingly consistent option up front, with an otherworldly work ethic. \n9. Suaia Matagi ($192,600) \nIn the frame for a starting spot in Parra’s front row. \n10. Leivaha Pulu ($221,200) \nInjuries to Agnatius Paasi and Ryan Simpkins, plus the exit of Greg Bird and David Shillington, pave the way for an increased opportunity. SuperCoach god, Sam Burgess. Source: Getty Images \nSECOND ROW FORWARDS \n*Note: Includes all FRF-2RF dual-position players. \n1. Sam Burgess ($499,300 2RF-FRF) \nExpect even more ‘Surge’ with another NRL pre-season under the code-hopper’s belt. In addition, the Rabbitohs’ non-Origin players have elite bye coverage. Burgess is as premium as it gets. \n2. Bryce Cartwright ($497,200 2RF-5/8) \nA move back to the second row should mean more statistical stability. And despite the positional switch out of the halves, Cartwright’s still a high voltage proposition with the ball in hand. \n3. Paul Gallen ($503,900 2RF-FRF) \nWith Origin a thing of Gal’s past, the focus shifts purely to premiership defence … and he just can’t help involvement at a high rate. \n4. Ryan James ($487,400 2RF-FRF) \nBecame one of the bona fide fantasy forwards last season and knows the way to the white stripe. \n5. Trent Merrin ($492,900 2RF-FRF) \nHas become one of the most steady middle forward options in the game, plus is handy in attack. \n6. Jason Taumalolo ($433,100) \nFollowing a mammoth back end of 2016, hopes are he picks up where he left off. \n7. Jake Trbojevic ($438,000 2RF-FRF) \nHanded the fulltime lock role, which could see the Manly rising star’s work rate rise. \n8. Simon Mannering ($450,600) \nHis appetite for defence is almost unrivalled. \n9. Paul Vaughan ($341,300 2RF-FRF) \nMoving to the Red V on big money means strong involvement’s in the pipeline. \n10. Luke Yates ($122,600 2RF-FRF) \nAt bargain basement price and likely to win a spot on Nathan Brown’s bench. Cowboys star Johnathan Thurston. Source: Getty Images \nHALFBACKS \n*Note: All dual position halfback/five-eighths have been discussed in this section and are exempt from the five-eighth section below. \n1. Johnathan Thurston ($467,000) \nThe best player in the NRL and an absolute SuperCoach gun. \n2. Shaun Johnson ($464,300) \nIf reports of him getting the kicking duties back are true, might be starting the season undervalued. \n3. Kane Elgey ($226,700) \nIncredibly undervalued at his current price due to his injury-affected 2016 campaign. \n4. Brock Lamb ($176,500) \nWill start alongside Trent Hodkinson in the halves and should make enough money to justify his selection. \n5. James Maloney ($335,100) \nIf he can produce anything close to his SuperCoach output from the Roosters, he is incredibly undervalued to start the season. \n6. Daly Cherry-Evans ($358,500) \nThe Sea Eagles should have more positional stability this season and with that should come a return to form for their star playmaker. \n7. Adam Reynolds ($385,200) \nInjury is the biggest blight on Adam Reynolds in both the NRL and SuperCoach. \n8. Te Maire Martin ($298,800) \nHas the makings of a very good NRL player and could translate that into SuperCoach points. Worth taking a flyer on. \n9. Nathan Cleary ($442,700) \nHas the kicking duties and halfback position sewn up for 2017. Scored incredibly well in his debut season but might start the season overvalued. \n10. Ben Hunt ($372,400) \nHas the ability to go huge and if you believe he’ll start the season hot, is slightly undervalued. \n11. (Special Mention) Jai Field ($122,600) \nIf he gets the starting Dragons halfback role, he is arguably the No.1 ranked halfback. It’s been head down, ass up for Jarryd Hayne this pre-season at the Gold Coast. Source: News Corp Australia \nFIVE-EIGHTH \n**Note: All dual position Five-Eighth/Fullbacks are discussed in this section and are exempt from the Fullback section below. \n1. Jarryd Hayne ($244,700) \nDon’t think about it. Just pick him. \n2. Mitchell Moses ($371,100) \nWill he be the primary goal kicker at the Tigers? If so, becomes a very viable option. \n3. Anthony Milford ($444,800) \nWill probably be in most final SuperCoach sides and started last season as THE SuperCoach must have. \n4. Matthew Moylan ($421,100) \nFinished last season as hot as anyone. If he continues, is well worth a go. \n5. Michael Morgan ($391,600) \nAnother who can go as big as anyone in SuperCoach. \n6. Cody Walker ($444,900) \nBreakout season last year means he begins the year as a premium priced player. If he maintains that form, is a very good option. \n7. Greg Inglis ($402,100) \nIf you’re looking for a POD who is underpriced compared to their previous best, look no further. \n8. Corey Norman ($367,600) \nParramatta’s primary playmaker. Has great bye coverage and a chance to become the number one goal kicker should Gutherson not produce. \n9. Daylight! \n10. Blake Austin ($293,300)/Josh Reynolds ($349,000)/Gareth Widdop ($334,800) \nThey are probably all at long odds to return to SuperCoach relevance again, but deserve a legacy mention. Sea Eagles’ Tom Trbojevic makes his move to FB, full time. Source: Getty Images \nWING/CENTRE \n*Note: So much uncertainty surrounds the choice in outside backs this season. It is for this reason we have extended the Power Rankings to include most of the players we deem as viable options thus far. \n1. Tom Trbojevic ($437,400 C/W-FB) \nWill play fullback this season for the Sea Eagles where he scored incredibly well in 2016. \n2. Tohu Harris ($448,100 C/W-2RF) \nMight not perform as well as he did in 2016, but is still a premium option. \n3. Sione Mata’utia ($308,700 C/W-2RF) \nPlaying 80 minutes on the edge for the Knights might see him emerge as a premium option. \n4. Siosifa Talaki ($160,400) \nShould assume Aaron Gray’s left centre spot until he returns from injury. \n5. Jamal Idris ($263,600 C/W-2RF) \nLocked up a position in the centres for the Tigers and is very likely better than his price indicates. \n6. Nick Cotric ($122,600) \nIs a freakish talent and could maintain a position in the team even when Jarrod Croker returns. \n7. Akuila Uate ($172,500) and Dean Whare ($143,600) \nThe lack of cheap outside backs means that we may have to rely on some previously unreliable options (for one reason or another). SuperCoaches are hoping that Uate and Whare can string together a strong run of games early on. \n8. Curtis Scott ($143,600) \nStarting at left centre for the Storm and is almost rookie-priced. A near no brainer providing we can guarantee job security. \n9. Dylan Walker ($303,400 C/W-5/8) \nWill kick goals for the Sea Eagles from his favoured right centre position. \n10. Konrad Hurrell ($315,300) \nPlayed very well for the Titans after arriving from the Warriors midway through 2016. \n11. Manu Ma’u ($386,800 C/W-2RF) \nWas forced to play centre last season due to injuries to the Eels’ outside backs and as such probably starts this season slightly under priced. \n12. Clinton Gutherson ($336,200 C/W-5/8) \nCombining hopeful improvement in his playmaking with the goal kicking duties at Parramatta should increase his output this season. \n13. Will Chambers ($313,200) \nInjury affected his 2016 but he has been a gun in the past. \n14. Semi Radradra ($409,900) \nHas been one of the best wingers in both SuperCoach and the NRL for a few seasons now. Even with his departure to France looming, will be there or thereabouts at season’s end. \n15. Jordan Kahu ($291,100 FB-C/W) \nAnother who will assume the full time goal kicking responsibilities for 2017 and thus should increase in value. Will he benefit from playing outside Anthony Milford on the left this season? \n16. Latrell Mitchell ($290,200 FB-C/W) \nIs expected to start the season playing left centre for the Roosters and should naturally improve in his second season. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck excelled in the Warriors’ trial against the Titans. Source: Getty Images \nFULLBACK \n*Note: Outside of the dual position players already discussed, the most realistic options at fullback to start the season are the three listed below: \n1. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck ($324,000) \nInjury affected his 2016, but if he stays fit this season, he’ll be one of the top SuperCoach scorers by season’s end. Should, along with Jarryd Hayne and several others, be in 100% of serious SuperCoach teams. \n2. Dylan Phythian ($156,400 FB-HOK) \nHas the inside running for the Newcastle Knights fullback position. Should make a better fist of it than last year’s starting fullback (and SuperCoach nightmare) Jaelen Feeney. \n3. James Tedesco ($466,300) \nHis inclusion is more dependent on your starting strategy than anything. If you want two gun fullbacks and have Hayne at five-eighth, look no further. \nDo you live in Queensland? Want to meet a bunch of NRL legends and talk footy with them?
