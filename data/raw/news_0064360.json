WAIKATO REGIONAL COUNCIL \nDead eels from the toxic discharge. \nResidents noticed a large number of distressed and dead eels and fish in a tributary that flows to the Ohinemuri River and notified Waikato Regional Council in early February 2016. \nThe council incident response team traced the contaminated stream and stormwater system back to a retirement village that was having its roof stripped for repainting. \nThe subsequent investigation found Chemwash Hamilton Ltd had completed the work at the retirement village without capturing the chemicals it was using or managing them in an environmentally safe manner. WAIKATO REGIONAL COUNCIL \nBanded kokopu were victims of the significant fish kill at Paeroa last year. \nThe conviction and fine was imposed this week in the Auckland District Court by Judge David Fitzpatrick, who stated the company's activities were \"at least reckless\", and the steps it had taken to protect against a discharge into the environment were \"completely inadequate\". \nHall pointed out the judge in his finding had acknowledged Chemwash's unblemished record, immediate guilty plea and its full co-operation with the council from the outset of the investigation. \n\"Chemwash has been operating for many years and this is the first incident of its kind we have had so obviously it is very upsetting,\" Hall said. \n\"We instigated a thorough review of our policies and practices after the incident in February. As a result of that review we implemented changes to our systems in March last year. Ad Feedback \n\"We got it wrong. We are extremely upset and disappointed with what happened. \n\"We are sorry this has happened but very pleased the regional council investigation showed that within 24 to 48 hours the tributary had returned to its normal state.\" \nCouncil investigations manager Patrick Lynch said that \"a company that deals with acutely toxic chemicals should have had exemplary measures in place to manage the risk to the environment\". \n\"We would like to acknowledge the quick work by Paeroa locals, who attempted to save some of the dying fish and contacted the council promptly. \n\"This was a completely avoidable incident. We are extremely disappointed with the actions of Chemwash and trust this fine will remind all users of toxic chemicals to ensure that they are managed properly.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:00:50.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
