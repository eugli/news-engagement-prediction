Disney's newest ride The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train completes the Fantasyland makeover at Magic Kingdom. © The Walt Disney Company By Dawn Henthorn Updated January 05, 2016 . \nOne thing is always a constant at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida... that's change. Here's what's new and what's back by popular demand... Before you Go Information \nIn case you missed it, Disney World quietly raised their ticket prices again on October 4, 2015. The bad news is a one day ticket now costs $105 for the Magic Kingdom! The good news is the more days you buy, the less it costs you per day — stay 10 days and get in the parks for only $36.50 per day (Park Hopper fees are additional). Also, it will cost you $2 more to park — from $15 to $17 a day! New 2016 Dates Announced \nNew dates for some of Disney World's most popular events have been announced. Why not make plans now to attend? Epcot International Flower & Garden Festival - March 2 thru May 30, 2016 Night of Joy - Early September (2016 Dates To Be Announced) Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party - Select Nights (TBA) in November thru December Coming Up in 2016 \nIf you haven't been to Disney World in a while you'll be surprised at all the new attractions and major theme park makeovers, but the best may be yet to come in 2016. Just imagine... One of Disney World's biggest transformations has been Downtown Disney morphing into Disney Springs .

It is leaving the skies of California behind and will reopen sometime the summer of 2016 with a new name, Soarin' Around the World , and feature some of the world's most unique natural landscapes and man-made wonders. A change that hasn't been popular at all with Star Wars' fans is the elimination of Disney's Star Wars Weekends . The popular event usually held in May is dropping off the galactic radar as Disney plans to break ground on its Star Wars Land themed area in early 2016. It is reported that the planned expansion at Disney's Hollywood Studios will cover about 14 acres. Due to its popularity, Night of Joy will be expanding and changing venues. Previously held exclusively at Disney's Magic Kingdom, the event's concerts will move to the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex where Christian songsters will perform on indoor and outdoor concert stages. The event will also include admission to the Magic Kingdom for fun and fellowship among concert-goers. Disney's Festival of the Masters will again be cancelled in 2016 due to the construction going on at the previous Downtown Disney.
