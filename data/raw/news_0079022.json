Deepinder Goyal, Founder and CEO, Zomato \nIt said, \nThere has been a lot of confusion amongst our users, restaurateurs, and the media about our ‘cloud kitchen’ service. 'Cloud kitchens' is a new phrase which doesn’t yet have a definition and is used for a wide variety of business models. With this note, we are hoping to clarify what we are planning to do, and the underlying business model. About Zomato Infrastructure Services \nWith Zomato Infrastructure Services (ZIS), the company plans to work with current restaurant owners to expand their business to more locations without incurring any fixed cost. \nHighlighting some key points, the blog says that these infrastructure services could be seen as delivery-only food courts without any take-out or dine-in facilities. \nEach ZIS facility will have four or more co-located restaurant brands, leading to shared (and thus lower) costs. Each restaurant brand will have its own space of roughly 300 sqft and can have owned/shared/outsourced delivery personnel, thus increasing delivery efficiencies. \nZomato will provide the real estate, build the kitchen, and supply all the equipment for these brands to just ‘walk in’ and start their business in a matter of hours. Moreover, the build-out cost for these kitchens will be low owing to the company’s frugal and durable engineering to ensure limited expenses. \nFor example, Zomato is using its data to identify nearby restaurants that have recently shut down, acquiring their (almost new) equipment at close to scrap value. What are Zomato’s plans for it? \nWhile these kitchens will be common in the front, customers will be able to select dishes from multiple brands to build a single food order. \nThe infrastructure will be operational by the first or second week of March, with the pilot kitchen being in Dwarka. The company will test the waters for a couple of months post March, during which period no new locations will be opened. \nBased on initial estimates, Zomato is confident about having 100 locations by the end of 2018. \nAccording to the blog, there won’t be any fixed cost for restaurant brands to use ZIS. In fact, the platform will only charge the restaurants a nominal percentage of their revenue, saying that it is key for them to have these restaurants win. On top of this, restaurants will pay a nominal fee for any other services that they use — order lead generation, advertising, etc. \nMoreover, the company makes a conservative current projection to say that it will be able to recover its CAPEX in six to nine months’ time. Over time, as Zomato scales the business, it is confident that costs of operation should come down further and increase return on capital. \nThe blog goes on to explore in depth the reasons why Zomato is betting on ZIS.
