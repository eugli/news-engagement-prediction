Picture: AP/Pablo Martinez Monsivais Source: AP \nHe added that he thinks Obama loyalists are also behind White House leaks.\n“I also understand that’s politics,” Mr Trump conceded. “And in terms of him being behind things, that’s politics. And it will probably continue.” He says he’s not surprised, saying, “I’m changing things that (Obama) wanted to do.”\nHe also said he’s tougher than Mr Obama in terms of his efforts to deport anyone living in the country illegally.\nTRUMP DENIES ‘MAJOR LEAK PROCESS’ \nMr Trump also denied that there’s a “major leak process” at the White House following reports that White House press secretary Sean Spicer targeted leaks from his own staff.\nMr Trump responded to a Politico report that said Spicer convened an “emergency meeting” after details of a planning meeting got out, and conducted a “phone check” to prove they hadn’t been leaking information.\nTo crack down on leaks, White House press secretary Sean Spicer reportedly collected his aides’ mobile phones to check for communication with reporters. Picture: AP/Manuel Balce Ceneta Source: AP \nHe says he “would have handled it differently than Sean. But Sean handles it his way and I’m OK with it.” Trump says “Sean Spicer is a fine human being,” but adds, “I would have gone one-on-one with different people.”\nTrump also said White House officials have “sort of ideas” about who may have leaked information, adding that “we have people from other campaigns, we have people from other governments.”\n. @POTUS reacts to WH staffers' phone check: \"I would've handled it differently than Sean, but Sean handles it his way & I'm ok with it\" pic.twitter.com/hZPta7GX35 \n— FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) February 28, 2017 \"I can't [take racist accusations personally]...I have to write it off as purely politics.\" - @POTUS pic.twitter.com/vxSM1ztsVu \n— FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) February 28, 2017 . @POTUS addresses skipping WHCD: In light of the fact of fake news, I thought it would be inappropriate that I went pic.twitter.com/AlPnK2K7KV \n— FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) February 28, 2017 HUGE RISE IN MILITARY SPENDING \nMr Trump’s advisers say he will use his prime-time speech Tuesday to declare early progress on his campaign promises, including withdrawing the US from a sweeping Pacific Rim trade pact, and to map a path ahead on thorny legislative priorities, including health care, infrastructure, and military spending. “We’re going to spend a lot more money on military,” Mr Trump said on Fox & Friends, saying he could stand to see even $30 billion more than what’s being recommended.\n“We’re going to get involved in negotiating. We’re going to be able to get, I think, a lot more product for a buck and I’m going to be very, very serious about it,” he said.\nHe also said the extra $US54 billion ($A70 billion) he has proposed spending on the US military will be offset by a stronger economy as well as cuts in other areas.\n“I think the money is going to come from a revved up economy,” Mr Trump said.\n“I mean you look at the kind of numbers we’re doing, we were probably GDP of a little more than one per cent and if I can get that up to three or maybe more, we have a whole different ball game. It’s a whole different ball game.”\nEarlier in the week, Mr Trump outlined what he called a “historic” increase in defence spending which has run into opposition from Republicans in Congress who say it is not enough to meet the military’s needs.\nThe proposed rise in the Pentagon budget to $US603 billion comes as the US has wound down major wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and remains the world’s strongest military power.\nThe plan came under fire from Democratic politicians, who said cuts being proposed to pay for the additional military spending would cripple important domestic programs such as environmental protection and education.\nDonald Trump expects to get a $60 billion increase in military spending from a “revved up economy.” Picture: AP/Evan Vucci Source: AP \nMr Trump also acknowledged that there remained hundreds of unfilled jobs in his administration, but says “they’re unnecessary to have.”\nMr Trump said he has no intention of filling many of the open positions. “I say, ‘What do all these people do?’ You don’t need all those jobs.”\nMr Trump also said that some are looking to criticise him for eliminating those positions, but he adds, “That’s not a bad thing. That’s a good thing. We’re running a very good, efficient government.”\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump will sign an executive order Tuesday mandating a review of an Obama-era rule aimed at protecting small streams and wetlands from development and pollution.\nA senior White House official says the order will instruct the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers to review a rule that redefined “waters of the United States” protected under the Clean Water Act to include smaller creeks and wetlands.\nThe official briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, despite the president’s recent complaints about unnamed sources.\nMr Trump had railed against the water rule during his campaign, slamming it as an example of federal overreach. Farmers and landowners have criticised the rule, saying there are already too many government regulations that affect their businesses, and Republicans have been working to thwart it since its inception.\nOMB Director says they have to take an ax to entitlements.
