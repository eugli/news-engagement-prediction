The former Cabinet minister said that the Labour leader was living “in a parallel universe” and was incapable of taking the party to victory in a general election. His withering verdict on Corbyn, delievered at a Jewish Chronicle event in Hampstead, came hours after a new ICM/Guardian opinion poll gave the Tories an 18-point lead over Labour. Mandelson said: “I work every single day to bring forward the end of his [Mr Corbyn’s] tenure in office. Every day I try to do something to rescue the Labour Party from his leadership.” But a Labour source told HuffPost UK: “The idea of Jeremy Corbyn being Prime Minister and implementing policies that actually benefit the people terrifies the establishment. “So it’s no surprise Peter Mandelson has found time in his busy schedule of spending time on oligarch’s yachts to attempt to undermine him.” The jibe was a reference to an incident in 2008 when the Labour peer famously joined George Osborne on a yacht belonging to Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, as a guest of financier Nathaniel Rothschild.

Speaking at the JC Editors Choice event at the JW3 community centre , Mandelson said: ”The problem with Jeremy is not that he’s a nasty man. It’s as if he’s in a parallel universe. “He’ll gravitate to whatever revolt, insurrection, every protest movement in sight. “He’s been like this for 35 years. He was not a frequent supporter of the last Labour government - he voted against it 500 times!” As Mandelson spoke, Corbyn was facing fresh leadership questions from MPs at the weekly Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) meeting in the Commons. Asked to explain the dire poll ratings, he referred to “problems we have had in the media”, adding “we do a lot better on social media”. At the PLP meeting, Corbyn warned that the Copeland and Stoke-on-Trent Central by-elections this Thursday were “on a knife-edge”. But Labour backbencher told him that the “main problem on the doorstep...is Jeremy Corbyn”. Stefan Rousseau/PA Archive Lord Mandelson and Tony Blair At the Hampstead event, Mandelson ruled out leaving Labour, saying: ”Why do you want to walk away and pass it to Jeremy Corbyn? I resent it”. Speaking earlier in the House of Lords on Monday, the peer claimed that while the British public voted for Brexit they did not wish to turn the UK into a “poorer, politically isolated, off-shore tax haven without reach or influence in the world”. On Sunday’s Andrew Marr Show, Mandelson urged peers to amend the EU withdrawal bill and called on the public to answer Tony Blair’s call to “rise up” against a ‘Brexit at all costs’.
