Image copyright David Stowell/Geograph Image caption Miss Satkunarajah is an electrical engineering student at Bangor University \n\"I was handed the refusal letter which states 'You do not have a right to appeal or administrative review against the decision to refuse your application',\" she said. \n\"I seek for help from everyone to overturn the decision to deport me on 28 February.\" \nMiss Satkunarajah's cousin Sugetha Kanagasabai told BBC Wales: \"It is not fair that she only has three months left to finish her degree. At least let her finish that. \n\"Shiromini came here when she was 12, her friends and family are here. She knows no-one and has nothing at all in Sri Lanka.\" \nIestyn Pierce, head of electrical engineering at Bangor University, described her as an \"exceptionally able and diligent\" student on course for a first class honours degree. \n\"Shiromini figures among the very best students, having secured very high grades in her examinations this January,\" he added. \n\"If allowed to graduate she would be sure to be a valuable member of the workforce in what is a world-wide shortage subject.\" 'Heartless indifference' \nStudent groups and the acting Bishop of London, Pete Broadbent, have also spoken out on Miss Satkunarajah's behalf. \nBishop Broadbent said: \"To deport her weeks before she finishes her degree and to remove her from the community that supports her seems draconian and harms both her and our church community. \n\"I would urge the authorities to exercise their discretion to enable this bright young woman to finish her degree.\" \nArfon MP Hywel Williams accused the Home Office of showing \"heartless indifference\" to Miss Satkunarajah. \n\"Her imminent deportation is not only unjust and unfair but will deprive Wales and indeed the UK economy of the contribution she will make,\" he said. \n\"Sri Lanka is still a very dangerous place and Shiromini has had no real ties with the country.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T19:46:51.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
