Yahoo's Jeff Passan adds that Hammel's deal is expected to be worth a guaranteed $16 million. The contract is pending a physical. \nHammel, 34, is coming off a 2016 season in which he pitched to a 3.83 ERA (105 ERA+) and 2.72 K/BB ratio in 30 starts for the Cubs. For his career, he owns an ERA+ of 97 and a K/BB ratio of 2.48 across parts of 11 big-league seasons. Of his 306 career games, 248 have been starts. \nAs for the Royals, they badly needed rotation depth after the free agent departure of Edinson Volquez to the Marlins and the tragic death of Yordano Ventura. Hammel is far from an optimal solution, but he's the best they could do on the free agent market at this late hour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:12:51.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
