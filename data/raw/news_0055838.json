SCOTT HAMMOND/FAIRFAX NZ \nFaith-based Richmond View School is making a bid to become a middle school and high school, as well as a primary school. \nRichmond View School wanted to provide a \"small, intimate\" alternative high school, where teachers had the ability to focus on individual students, principal Dave Pauling said. \nREAD MORE: \nThe new school would be designed to complement the other high schools, he said. SCOTT HAMMOND/FAIRFAX NZ \nYear 7 students at Richmond View School, from left, Felix Bell and Jayden Choi. \nThe school, which currently has a roll of 145 pupils, would ideally take 345 students in total - from 5-year-olds to 18-year-olds. \nRichmond View already had the land it needed, and the ministry would not need to fund the project. \n\"It's state-integrated which means that all the buildings have to be funded by the proprietor, which is the Elim Church,\" Pauling said. SCOTT HAMMOND/FAIRFAX NZ \nArtwork at Richmond View School, where creativity is encouraged. \nPauling expected a decision from the ministry this year as to whether the proposal could go ahead, but did not know when. \nHe knew some children who went to primary school at Richmond View, but were home schooled or sent to Nelson or Christchurch once they reached Year 9 because there were no faith-based high schools available to them. \n\"It's a really hard choice for families,\" he said. SCOTT HAMMOND/FAIRFAX NZ \nRichmond View School takes 145 students, but wants to expand to take more than 300 from Year 1 to Year 13. \nParents who wanted their children to attend Richmond View currently faced a two-year waiting list. The school added a sixth classroom over the summer holidays, after upping its roll cap to 145 students last year. \nAs a state-integrated school 95 per cent of Richmond View School's students had to be Christian, preventing Richmond View from taking students away from other schools, Pauling said. \nPupils from the wider community, including Blenheim's Catholic primary school St Mary's, could apply to go to secondary school at Richmond View, but preference would be given to existing Richmond View pupils. \nMarlborough Boys' College principal Wayne Hegarty said both colleges had been asked by the ministry to make a submission on Richmond View's proposal. \nHe could not say whether he supported or opposed the proposal, as he had not yet fully consider it. Marlborough Girls' principal Karen Stewart also declined to comment. \nPauling said consultation found the idea had widespread support from the parents of children already attending. \n\"That gave us the impetus to then go and write the application,\" Pauling said. \nPauling said the school had proposed a three-fold structure to the ministry, with a primary school, a middle school, from Year 7 to 10, and a high school, from Year 11 to Year 13. \nRichmond View unsuccessfully applied three years ago to introduce a middle school. \nPauling said the ministry told Richmond View it was the wrong time to apply, with discussion around the future of the colleges going on at the time. \nDevelopment into a high school would be gradual, with a Year 9 class expected to be introduced in 2019 at the earliest. \nThe school would offer the same range of subjects and NCEA standards as a state school, but with an emphasis on Christian values. \n\"For us it's about acknowledging the importance of Christian character in how we go about our day,\" Pauling said. \nThe middle school and high school would have a focus on excellence and on getting to know individual students and their interests and abilities. \nSeddon School principal Tania Pringle said she did not think the school would take students away from the existing colleges. \nBohally Intermediate School principal Shane Campbell said it would be \"fantastic\" if parents had more choice when it came to their children's middle and secondary school education. \nHe would not comment on whether Richmond View's plans would impact Bohally, which is Blenheim's only intermediate school. \nParent Neroli Vallance, who has two daughters at Richmond View, said she was pleased parents would have the option of sending their children to a faith-based high school. \nRichmond View \"really strives for excellence\", she said. \n\"I think it's a fantastic idea, I'm right behind it 100 per cent.\" â€‹ \nPauling said the school was already well-integrated in Marlborough's Community of Learning and with other schools throughout the country, and if the new development went ahead there would be more emphasis on learning by theme rather than subject. \nRichmond View was already on the cutting edge when it came to using technology, with Year 8 pupils video-conferencing a school in Auckland to learn coding. - The Marlborough Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:28:57.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
