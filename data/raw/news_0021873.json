France, Germany, India, China and Argentina. \nAnd it suggests that there is no clear link between material wellbeing and mental health. Fearful for the future \nWhile the UK is almost the lowest for wellbeing, along with countries such as Japan and South Korea, the top places were taken by young people in Indonesia, India and Nigeria. \nSouth Korea, with a reputation for a fiercely pressurised education system, was the only country where young people actively disliked where they lived. \nYoung people across this global sample, including the UK, reported that they were more pessimistic than optimistic about the future. \nAlthough young people in China and India both bucked these gloomy expectations - with their young anticipating a more positive future. \nThe perception of risk from extremism, terrorism and conflict was widespread - more so than worries about climate change or inequalities between rich and poor. \nIn the UK, extremism and terror was identified as the biggest single reason for being \"fearful for the future\", followed by the threat of \"conflict and war\". \nThere were big differences in attitudes towards the principle of free speech - and whether it should be protected even for views might offend. \nOnly about a third of young people in Nigeria supported the right to free speech, if it was likely to offend some ethnic groups or religious beliefs. \nIn contrast, more than two-thirds of young people in Argentina supported free speech, regardless of who it might antagonise. \nBut there was a common global trend for these young people to hold broadly liberal views on issues such as migration, religious tolerance, equal rights for men and women and acceptance of same-sex marriage. \n\"At a time of nationalist and populist movements that focus on the differences between people, the evidence shows that young people - whatever their nationality or religion - share a strikingly similar view of the world,\" said Vikas Pota, chief executive of the Varkey Foundation. \n\"Teenagers in Nigeria, New Delhi and New York share many of same priorities, fears, ambitions and opinions. \n\"There is far more unity among young people than a glance at the headlines would suggest. \n\"Young people are passionate believers in the right to live the life that they choose, whatever their background, free of prejudice of all kinds.\" \nBut Mr Pota said that this was also a generation that was \"deeply pessimistic about the future of the world\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T16:48:23.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
