( Note: Responses have been edited for length and clarity. ) Mike Nudelman/Samantha Lee/Business Insider \n'If you limit your spending, you'll have more freedom. Debt takes away your freedom, avoid it whenever you can. And if you're going to borrow, be smart about it and get the best deal you can.' Samantha Lee/Business Insider \nCredit cards carry some of the highest interest rates out there and can put you in a financial black hole if you overspend. Not to mention, it can take years to pay off credit card debt . Mike Nudelman/Samantha Lee/Business Insider \n'The importance of working for your money. This is the best way to understand how difficult it is to obtain something and give value to labour.' Samantha Lee/Business Insider \n'It's not the big expenses, but the smaller ones that can get you. So many of us focus on how to pay for the large expenses, such as a family vacation, but don't necessarily realise how all the trips to zoo can also make a dent and may not be part of our budget. Others may disagree, but it's the whole picture -- big and small, as well short and long term.' Mike Nudelman/Business Insider \n'Curb spending and take care of yourself. My parents had a number of kids and didn't have the means to overspend or support us after high school.' Samantha Lee/Business Insider \n'My grandfather owned a haircutting shop for most of his life. He amassed over a half a million dollars on that simple income. He told me you can make money two ways: With your muscles or with your brains.' Mike Nudelman/Samantha Lee/Business Insider \n'Budgeting at a relatively early age. We gave our kids (now grown) a relatively large allowance, but told them that they would use these funds for all discretionary purchases. Movies, clothes, gas, birthday presents, you name it. We bought required items (books, school athletic equipment, etc.). \n'We knew that the funds we gave them were not enough to allow them to live the high life; if they wanted more they would work for it. That taught them the value of money, in an environment of kids who were driving expensive cars to high school. They learned budgeting and making choices. Now grown, they are profiting from that lesson.' Mike Nudelman/Business Insider \n'You need to define a want versus a need. If you need it it should be included in your budget. If you just want it, you need to have the extra money saved somewhere!' Mike Nudelman/Samantha Lee/Business Insider \n'Live your wage. Don't get caught up with what others have or do. You have to only do what you can afford. Make a budget and a savings plan and stick with it! Build wealth slowly.' \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
