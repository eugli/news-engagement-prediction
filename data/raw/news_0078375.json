(Viola Pruss/CBC)\nCorbett said all of the company's restaurants are now closed except for two independent franchises in Halifax and Vancouver. He's not sure if they can keep the name, though.\nEmployees in Fredericton were told Friday that the business was closing. The two Fredericton locations were staffed by about 12 people.\nCorbett said the expansion plans were never meant to hurt anyone.\nHe added the community's response to the closures has been humbling. Without the strong fan base, the two Relish restaurants in Fredericton would never have operated as long as they did, he said.\n\"We wanted to be part of the pride that people have in this great city,\" he said. \"We wanted people to brag about the fact that Relish started in the city.\n\"And it became part of the Fredericton culture, like Starbucks is with Seattle.
