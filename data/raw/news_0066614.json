We went to MultiChoice (satellite television provide DSTV). We also delivered that message. \n“We also went to the South African High Commission (embassy) where we burned their flag to pass on a message to them that we don’t have a relationship any longer.” \nKadiri added: “All the South Africans in Nigeria should leave Nigeria within 48 hours or else we won’t be able to guarantee their security.” \nAFP ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:41:25.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
