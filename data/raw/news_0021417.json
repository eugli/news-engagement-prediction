Could   \nAnother council has backed the Sunday Mirror’s campaign to scrap child burial fees and end heartbreak for grieving parents. \nSince we launched our campaign - along with Labour - last year, a number of councils have agreed to cancel their child burial fees. \nNow Oxford councillors have voted unanimously to get rid of the charges for youngsters. \nAt a meeting this week Cllr Ruth Wilkinson said: “The loss of a loved one is always very sad, but the loss of a much longed-for-baby or infant must be almost unbearable. \n“It is hard for us to comprehend how difficult it must be for grieving families to cope with this tragic circumstance at what should be a very happy time.” Read More Council urges local authorities to follow them in doing \"right thing\" by scrapping child burial charges Oxford councillors voted unanimously to remove the charges (Photo: Getty) \nOxford council made just £5,100 from child burials last year and Mrs Wilking said it made sense to scrap the fees. \nDuring the emotional meeting, fellow councillor Mark Lygo revealed he had lost a child in 1999. \nHe said: “My wife was nearly full term, just over eight months and it was very traumatic and stressful at the time. \n“And one of the stresses for us was trying to find the money. \nWe are calling for an end to funeral costs for the 5,000 people who lose a child every year.

They join local authorities all over the UK who are doing the right thing. \n“On March 8 the government has a chance to put a Children’s Funeral Fund in the Budget and help ease the pain of grieving families.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T19:12:04.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
