The reporter appears to have been referring to the redacted story published by the Daily Mail that is now the center of a $150 lawsui t from the first lady. The lawsuit was dismissed from a Maryland court but later re-filed in New York City by Trump. She tweeted apologies and retractions about the story from other news outlets after first filing the lawsuit. \nThis is not the first time the Trump ladies have been unfairly targeted by news media outlets. In January, Fox News’ Brit Hume blasted what he called a “chickens**t” story criticizing a trifling detail about Melania on the White House website’s page about her. And in December, a Politico writer was fired for asking on her twitter account if Trump had committed incest with his daughter Ivanka. \nRatajkowksi is no fan of President Trump however – she protested against the Muslim ban and posted about it on her social media account.\npic.twitter.com/3WMUvCNZ6x \n— Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) January 30, 2017 \n\nAnd supported Black Lives Matter.\n#blacklivesmatter pic.twitter.com/MGLINWZOs7 \n— Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) January 22, 2017 \n\nBut unlike some other feminists on the left, at least Ratajkowksi is intellectually honest enough to call out sexism against the right and the left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:02:20.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
