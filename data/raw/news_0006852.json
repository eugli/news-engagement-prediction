A video posted by Paul Labile Pogba (@paulpogba) on Jan 31, 2017 at 6:38am PST \nH owever the video has not gone down well with former Manchester United captain, Rio Ferdinand, who believes the pair should be concentrating on helping to improve their team's performances on the pitch, rather than practicing their dance routines. \nManchester United currently sit sixth in the Premier League table and Ferdinand believes Pogba and Lingard are in no position to be celebrating. \n“I've just seen a video of the lads dancing in the changing room. I'm all for having a bit of fun on social media and stuff. But not when you're sixth in the league, and you're not in the Champions League positions and you're fighting,” said Ferdinand, who was on BT Sport punditry duty for Liverpool's match with Chelsea on Tuesday evening.

Until you've won something you can't go out and do stuff like that. \n“The way I see it we're fifth in the league, we're fighting for a Champions League position we haven't got any silverware yet. \n\"I've dug out Arsenal players for doing stuff like this before and it would be wrong of me to not talk about the United players. \n“I’d want to keep myself out of the radar a little bit until I get to that point.” Paul Pogba posted the video on his Instagram page Credit: Reuters \nT he former England defender admitted he would be happy to share the video in normal circumstances, but only when the occasion warrants it. \n“I'm all for having fun and I think part of Pogba's appeal especially is that he is a happy free spirit and I wouldn’t want to take that away from him. But I think there's a time and getting the balance right. \n“If that comes out when you've won a cup final I’d be the first on to be pushing it out all over the place.\" \nManchester United play Hull for the third time in a week on Wednesday evening with Jose Mourinho's side hoping to move up in the table after their rivals all dropped points on Tuesday evening.
