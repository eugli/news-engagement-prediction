Maxx dropped her brand—both a political move and because the clothes are just not selling. Time to forget about that because apparently, her namesake perfume is selling like pancakes on Amazon. \nIvanka’s Eau de Parfum is currently the number one top-selling fragrance on Amazon . She took the top two spots, one for the full-sized bottle and the other for the roll-on version . But something smells incredibly fishy and the reviews on the website confirms it. \nOne of the top customer reviews read, “I ordered this to support Ivanka Trump, but I’m also very happy with the perfume spray.” Another took a jab at Tom Ford and we all know where that is rooting from , “Highly recommend[-ed]. Much better than the over-priced crap from the likes of Tom Ford.” Some even bragged how she got compliments on the scent and side-tracked to how she supports the family, “Get (sic) many compliments and questions on what it is and where I got it. Plus, I am supporting President Trump and his family.” Uh-huh, not so subtle. \nThese two took the cake, “We don’t care what it smells like. We support Ivanka Trump,” and “Love, love, love this Eau de Parfum Spray! All of Ivanka’s scents are great! This one is no different!” It sounds like words straight from Kellyanne Conway and Donald Trump’s mouths. \nAs Refinery29 pointed out, there were no negative comments on the page so far.
