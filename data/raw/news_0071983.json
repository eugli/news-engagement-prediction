Most Popular By Jack Holmes Feb 22, 2017 President Trump's trip to the African-American History Museum Tuesday was yet another moment born with one foot in a late-night monologue. For a man who seems to think Frederick Douglass is still alive and whose main appeal to black voters during the campaign was, \"what have you got to lose?\" this kind of appearance just doesn't work. Stephen Colbert had some fun while illustrating that last night: Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Popular The Late Show host gleefully took aim at the fact the president missed his initial appearance, on Martin Luther King Day, due to a \"scheduling\" issue. \"I have a dream,\" Colbert faux-quoted MLK, \"unless something else comes up. Then it can wait.\" But that scheduling conflict actually came up within days of President Trump's ugly confrontation with Civil Rights icon John Lewis , when the president alleged that a man who was nearly beaten to death at Selma while marching for voting rights—which he eventually helped to win—was \"all talk, no action.\" Yes, the President of the United States publicly insulted a Civil Rights hero on the weekend of Martin Luther King Day in 2017. Yes, he then canceled his trip to the African-American History Museum on Martin Luther King Day. ( CNN cites a source claiming the first trip was nixed by the Secret Service.) Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 Credit where it's at least minimally due: President Trump did show up this time. And much like at that same Black History Month breakfast where he seemed to think it quite possible Frederick Douglass was standing somewhere in the room, Trump devoted about as much time to Ben Carson as he did to any Civil Rights or abolitionist figure who might have been honored at the museum. While he's not the first recent Republican president with a spotty record on race, Trump demonstrates his complete non-interest in the issues, experience, and history of black Americans at nearly every opportunity. He does not even pay them lip service. At that breakfast, he could scarcely name a single specific accomplishment of any of the people mentioned. Yesterday, he at least read from some prepared remarks, although he eventually ended up focusing on Ben Carson and, at one point, on the size of his election victory in South Carolina. Related Story What a Weekend It Was for Civil Rights The president dug himself a deep hole with his campaign, where references to the community were mostly limited to the crime rate in Chicago. When you factor in the housing discrimination and the Central Park Five , the hole is that much deeper. The least he could do is prepare for these events and stay on topic. Oh, and show some goddamned respect for John Lewis, who entered his 77th year yesterday and served his country in nearly every one of them.
