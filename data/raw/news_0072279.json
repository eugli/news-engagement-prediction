Is the wheel on the boot lid going away?(Ford website) \nPlanning to buy a Ford EcoSport anytime soon? Patience is advised. \nFord Motor Company had unveiled its new 2017 EcoSport for the North American markets in November. From the first pictures, the car looked fresh and better than the outgoing model, which has been rocking the compact-SUV segment since its launch in 2013. The rear gets a major change. But is the wheel on the boot lid going off in India? (Ford website) \nFrom the pictures, it looks like Ford will take the fifth wheel off the boot lid. But recent pictures which surfaced on autoblogs suggested the extra wheel may stay in the India version. \nUpdates also include a more trapezoidal three-slotted grille with broader wrapped-around headlamps. The rear gets a chrome appliqué at the centre, underlined by the number plate, which does remind you of the Vitara Brezza. \nFord EcoSport was among the firsts to break into the sub-four-metre SUV segment, launched in June 2013 at an attractive price of Rs 5.59 lakh (Petrol) and Rs 6.69 lakh (Diesel). The closest rival was Renault Duster then starting at Rs 7.99 lakh.
