SEE ALSO: Tom Hiddleston voiced a 'Planet Earth II' trailer and it's just very important \nSir David Attenborough, who does the glorious voiceover behind the celebrated programme, is back for another documentary series, this time a sequel to 2001's The Blue Planet on the BBC. \nThe seven-part series, filmed over four years in every continent and every ocean with the support of marine scientists, will focus on recent scientific discoveries using state-of-the-art filming innovations. \nThat includes \"tow cams\" that can capture predatory fish, dolphins head-on, suction cams attached to the back of sharks and orcas and a probe camera that can record miniature marine life, the BBC reports . \n\"I am truly thrilled to be joining this new exploration of the underwater worlds which cover most of our planet, yet are still its least known,\" Attenborough said. \nNaturally, people were stoked to see the 90-year-old British legend back in action: For anyone lamenting only 6 Eps in #PlanetEarth2 fear not, we're comin back atchya with Attenborough's #BluePlanet2 ! https://t.co/hpGJarXfnT \n— Chadden Hunter (@ChaddenH) February 20, 2017 Brilliant news.
