A total of 12 residents were displaced and were relocated to other rooms for the night.\nA 79-year-old man was taken to hospital with smoke inhalation. He has since been charged with arson with disregard for human life and arson with damage to property.\nThe accused will appear in court by video at a future date.\nPhotos One person was taken to hospital after a fire at Woods Park Care Centre in Barrie, Ont. on Wednesday, Feb. 22, 2017.
