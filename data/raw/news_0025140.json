Atomic-scale catalysts may produce cheap hydrogen January 22, 2014 \nResearchers at North Carolina State University have shown that a one-atom thick film of molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) may work as an effective catalyst for creating hydrogen. The work opens a new door for the production of cheap ... Researchers find way to tune thermal conductivity of 2-D materials October 21, 2016 \nResearchers have found an unexpected way to control the thermal conductivity of two-dimensional (2-D) materials, which will allow electronics designers to dissipate heat in electronic devices that use these materials. Molybdenum disulfide holds promise for light absorption May 5, 2016 \nMechanics know molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as a useful lubricant in aircraft and motorcycle engines and in the CV and universal joints of trucks and automobiles. Rice University engineering researcher Isabell Thomann knows ... New findings boost promise of molybdenum sulfide for hydrogen catalysis December 1, 2016 \nResearchers from North Carolina State University, Duke University and Brookhaven National Laboratory have found that molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) holds more promise than previously thought as a catalyst for producing hydrogen ... Scientists discover a better metal contact that improves two-dimensional transistor performance January 19, 2015 \nTwo-dimensional (2D) materials such as molybdenum-disulfide (MoS2) are attracting much attention for future electronic and photonic applications ranging from high-performance computing to flexible and pervasive sensors and ...
