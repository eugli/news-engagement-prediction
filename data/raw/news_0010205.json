ADVERTISEMENT \nWhen host Willie Revillame requested them to dedicate a ‘thank you” message to each other, Delfin used his own moment to express his infatuation for his loyal best friend. \n“Ayun, lulubusin ko na, masasabi ko na yung nararamdaman ko para sa’yo (I will take this opportunity to confess my feelings for you),” Delfin said, to the sheer delight and “kilig” (thrill) of the audience. “Isa ka sa mga inspirasyon ko, lagi kitang iniisip, [at] may gusto ‘ata ako sa’yo (You are one of my inspirations, I think of you every time, and I think I’m falling in love with you).” \nHowever, he promised to wait for Vane until they finish their studies. “Face doesn’t matter,” he joked to Revillame. \nIn a creative response to his revelation, Vane sung lyrics of the classic song “Can’t Help Falling in Love” and said she respected his feelings and would continue to support him all the way. \nDelfin said that he admired some of Vane’s qualities–she is a whiz in playing the violin and piano, in addition to her melodic singing skills and personality. \nThe Wowowin episode was one of the most-streamed clips on YouTube as of Monday.
