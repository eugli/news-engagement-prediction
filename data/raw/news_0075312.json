I want all students to raise their voices against the violence and say that they will not tolerate this,” she said. \nGurmehar further said that she has received threats on various platforms. \n“But I will not get scared because I know that I am standing for the right. And it does not matter to me that you are an organisation which is in power, no one can tell me that I should be scared,” she added. \nGurmehar also justified the reasons for initiating her campaign. \n“It was a simple day that, when I got to know that my female colleagues have been physically assaulted in the protest which took place in the Ramjas College. I also got to know that women were given rape threats. According to me, it was high time to take action against these ABVP people or for that matter any student organisations which try to challenge the law and order or attempts to misbehave,” said Gurmehar. \n“And that is why we started this campaign so that we can send across a message that we will not bear any nonsense or violence. I love my country and I also love my fellow students and I support their right to freedom of speech,” she added. \nGurmehar further said, “I have been termed anti-national. However, I don’t feel the need to prove my nationalism. The fact is that are they nationalists? No when you threaten your fellow citizens, you don’t remain a nationalist.” \nAfter the North Campus clash, Kaur had changed her Facebook profile picture holding a placard which read: \"I am a student from Delhi University. I am not afraid of ABVP. I am not alone. Every student of India is with me. #StudentsAgainstABVP.\" \nGurmehar had earlier said that she received rape threats on social media after the campaign. Kaur has faced verbal backlash on Facebook, with many saying her father would be extremely unhappy with her for supporting ‘anti-nationals’. \nDelhi University's Ramjas College had on Wednesday witnessed large-scale violence between members of the AISA and ABVP. The genesis of the clash was an invite to JNU students Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid to address a seminar on 'Culture of Protests' which was withdrawn by the college authorities following opposition by the ABVP.
