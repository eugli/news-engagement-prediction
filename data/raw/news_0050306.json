MP minister’s quiz for schoolchildren india Updated: Feb 20, 2017 11:11 IST Shruti Tomar Hindustan Times, Bhopal Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan showering flower petals on students during the mass teaching event 'Mil- Banchey Madhya Pradesh' during his visit at his Alma Mater Government Sanjay Gandhi Middle School in Bhopal on Saturday. Madhya Pradesh agriculture minister Gauri Shankar Bisen asked questions on the BJP to elementary school children as part of this programme.(PTI) \nWhat is the symbol of the BJP? When was the BJP formed? Who is the Prime Minister of India and to which party does he belong? Madhya Pradesh agriculture minister Gauri Shankar Bisen asked these “general knowledge” questions not to any party worker but to students of elementary classes at a government primary school in Indore. \nBisen’s questions came during the government’s mass teaching event “Mile Banche Madhya Pradesh” on Saturday. His queries flummoxed not only students but also the teachers. For good measure, he told the students that these are important things and they must be aware of them. \nBisen also asked students who was providing mid-day meals to them and who was the chief minister of state. \nNot only this, he concluded his teaching assignment by shouting ‘Jai Jai Shree Ram’ and asked students to repeat it. \nRead | Ministers want education system to make students more patriotic \nWhen HT asked Bisen about the motive of asking questions related to the BJP, he had no qualms about it. “I am a minister of BJP-led government. The Prime Minister is also from BJP. It’s my party why shouldn’t I ask these questions to the students. They must know about the ruling party,” he said. \nAnother faux pass \nIn Khandwa district, the government’s exercise backfired to reveal a low standard of education. In a primary school where school education minister Vijay Shah went to teach, not only students but a teacher also failed to read out from a Hindi book of fifth standard. \nShah asked students to read a lesson of their Hindi book but students failed to read. Shah, then, asked the teacher Rewaram Banethia to read it. But he also failed to read it properly. \nThe infuriated minister asked the teacher and asked what salary he was drawing. Shah said he wouldn’t punish anyone but told the teacher that he should be ashamed.
