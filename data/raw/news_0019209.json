(Mary Altaffer/AP)   9:47 PM \nJim Dolan banned Charles Oakley from the Garden. \nIn reality, forcing him to watch every remaining minute in this Knicks season would be a worse punishment. \nSurrounded by Oakley chants and an increasingly frustrated fan base, the Knicks lost again Friday night, 131-123 to the Nuggets. It's their fourth straight defeat. They've dropped 23 of their last 31 games to plummet out of the playoff picture. \nCarmelo Anthony scored 19 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter to keep the game competitive down the stretch. But the effort was too late. \nThe game was more of the same for Dolan's team. The Knicks failed to defend. They let up 121 points to the miserable Lakers on Sunday before surrendering 119 to the Clippers on Wednesday. The 131 points the Nuggets scored are the most the Knicks have allowed in regulation this season. \nThe effort just isn't consistent enough to produce winning basketball. Early in the third quarter, Kristaps Porzingis turned the ball over on an out of bounds pass. The Knicks then didn't account for Nuggets guard Gary Harris, and he slipped behind his sleepwalking opponents. \nNuggets center Nikola Jokic, who dropped a game-high 40 points, collected the ball behind the sideline and delivered a floating pass. Harris dunked the ball home without any pressure, as the Garden crowd groined in utter disappointment. \nIt's the type of play that never happened under Oakley's watch. It's also the type of play that epitomizes the Knicks in 2017.
