Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 7, 2017 \nI n case you can't see the image attached to the tweet above, it features a picture of Rowling overlaid with the following text: \"One day in the middle of my life the news headlines will be J.K. Rowling died today. \n\"My children won’t fully understand why I left the room crying, or why I picked up a book titled, Harry Potter. \n“Millions will pull out old toy wands. Cloaks and round rimmed glasses will be dusted off. Wands lit, they will take them to the streets, holding them high, from speakers and phones. Hogwarts will come back to life as a new generation is introduced to The Boy Who Lived.” \nRowling described the image as \"very sweet\" adding, not unreasonably, \"but I won't be offended if you untag me when making plans for my death.\" \nWhen another follower remarked that that tweet would \"blow up\" when the author does pass away, she replied: \"Yes, let's talk more about when I die. It's cheering me right up.\" \nIn another tweet she added: \"Seriously, tweet whatever you like. I just don't want to be tagged in on the funeral plans. It's... weird.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:47:12.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
