(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Leslie Postal in the fall.\nAP classes help students “learn the work ethic” they’ll need in college, she added. \nSan Filippo is taking seven AP classes this year and has taken plenty in prior years, too. She has passed most of her AP exams but stumbled last year on the AP physics 1 exam. The class, led by a “fantastic” teacher, was still worthwhile, she said. \n“I think most people are in it for the teachers and the high-level classes,” she said. \nIn fact, her AP calculus teacher, Rebekah Krausman, is why so many Winter Springs students take the upper-level math classes, she said.. “She’s really passionate about it. She really cares.” \nIn class, Krausman seems eager to make sure her students understand the material. “Anyone else?” she asked. “Even if it’s a little one, ask me a question.” \nKrausman’s passing rates are high, but like other educators she said she is confident all her students benefit, even those who do not pass. “It’s preparing them for college courses,” she said. \nAt East Ridge, Assistant Principal Stacy Keaveny, who oversees the school’s AP offerings, said AP enrollment grew as more students were encouraged to sign up. \n“Obviously we don’t want to put a student in a class that’s setting them up for failure,” she said. \nBut the school has found that many more students than once thought can tackle the material. And as Williams’ AP calculus scores showed, some can meet the challenge of the exams, even when their past academic performance suggests they might not. \n“They get hungry,” Williams said. “Motivating them is really what’s the key.” \nlpostal@orlandosentinel.com 407-420-5273 \n» Caption Lawmakers want to move testing to end of school year \nLawmakers want Florida students to take their standardized tests at the end of the school year, instead of the current time, starting at the end of February. \nLawmakers want Florida students to take their standardized tests at the end of the school year, instead of the current time, starting at the end of February.
