(Getty Images) \nBy Bruce Levine– \nMESA, Ariz. (CBS) — This side of great talent, versatility is the top component that Cubs manager Joe Maddon desires on his 25- man roster. Projecting ahead for the 2017 team, only first baseman Anthony Rizzo and shortstop Addison Russell will be penciled in at one position. \nLast year, it was utilityman Ben Zobrist who proved to be a huge difference-maker in the championship run. Zobrist was available as the starting second baseman and eventually left fielder as the season progressed. He was able to bat in any slot and produce good results. \nAnother player who will be counted on for some versatility in 2017 may be Jon Jay, the former Cardinal and Padre who will be ready to play all three outfield position. Even more essential to the Cubs may be be his on-base percentage and lead-off experience. \n“He is so adept at all of that stuff out there,” Maddon said. “He is a perfect fit. He is a perfect complement to (Albert Almora) also. I am getting to know him better. Talking to other baseball people, they call him one of the best. He has a high baseball IQ. You love versatility. You really love versatility with cooperation.” \nJay is a player who understands his role, and the beauty is he can segue between being a starter and coming off the bench with ease. \nThat ‘s a trait managers love. \n“I am just trying to be a part of this group now,” Jay said. “I am here to help wherever they need me.” \nJay had offers to sign elsewhere in the offseason, but Chicago represented a chance to go back to the playoffs. \nWhen he signed, Jay knew he would be used in numerous roles and also knew that Maddon likes to keep everyone fresh and use his entire bench. \n“It is all about winning,” Jay said. “It is all about playing in October. Last year was the first year I had missed that. It was kind of hard watching the teams in the playoffs on TV. I was rooting for my friends getting rings. I am glad to be back in that atmosphere this season.” \nJay, who turns 32 in March, is a top-flight defender who takes good routes to the ball in all three outfield positions. He signed a one-year, $8-million contract with the Cubs in late November. He’s a .287 lifetime hitter with a .352 on-base percentage. \n“This is the role that I started my career playing,”Jay said about his ultra-utility role. “I had to climb and fight from the beginning. The job is all about keeping yourself ready. You just have to be mentally and physically prepared. The good thing about this team is we are deep and anyone can hit anywhere in the lineup. We have a deep bench. That is the sign of a good team. That is what it takes to play in October and win a championship.” \nA former Cardinal, Jay will be greeted or jeered in a different way by St. Louis fans than he was as a San Diego player last season. The Cubs and Cardinals play on opening night at Busch Stadium, which figures to be an intense contest. \n“We will see how they react,” Jay said of Cardinals fans. “St. Louis was obviously a great chapter in my life. We won a championship while I was there. We will see how I am received.” \nBruce Levine covers the Cubs a nd White Sox fo r 670 The Score and CBSChicago.com. Follow him on Twitter @MLBBruceLevine.
