Joe Shuman/For The Lake County News-Sun (Joe Shuman / Chicago Tribune) Luke Hammill News-Sun Privacy Policy \nCrews in Round Lake Beach had to wait until daylight to lift a sport-utility vehicle out of a retention pond Sunday after a man crashed it into the water overnight, officials said. \nThe Greater Round Lake Fire Protection District received a call at about 2:37 a.m. about a vehicle accident, said Battalion Chief Tony Carraro. A man had gone into a Meijer store to report that his vehicle was in the water. \nThe automobile — a small Suzuki sport-utility vehicle — was submerged in a retention pond at the Home Depot in Round Lake Beach, Carraro said. The store is on the west side of Illinois Route 83 and north of Hook Drive, near the Round Lake Beach train station. Officials determined it was \"too hazardous\" to recover the vehicle in the dark, Carraro said. \nCrews began to retrieve the vehicle at 10:30 a.m. Sunday, according to Carraro. \nThere were no other passengers in the vehicle, Carraro said. The driver was evaluated by an ambulance crew but was not transported to the hospital, he added. \nTwitter @lucashammill", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:03:20.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
