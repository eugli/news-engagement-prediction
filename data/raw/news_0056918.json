Credit: ITV News Anglia It was a gift that enabled her to connect with millions of young readers.\nHelen admitted that her most popular character, Electra Brown, was based on her own experiences of being of at school.\nShe wrote that she used to “sit and stare out of the window, dreaming of anything but lessons, then go home and write pages and pages in my diary of who did what to whom and (usually) why wasn’t I part of it.”\nShe spent her teens sending short stories and poems to ‘anyone she could think of’, and sometimes found herself in print.\nAfter a degree in science, Helen worked in the media, running a London-based character licensing agency.\nWhile she was handling the licensing for internationally renowned properties such as Snoopy, Nintendo, Rugrats and The Simpsons, she began to create her own characters in the books she had started writing.\nAnne McNeil (left) worked closely with Helen Bailey. Credit: ITV News Anglia Helen’s editor, Anne McNeil, Senior publisher at Hodder Children’s Books, remembers the day she went for lunch with Helen more than a decade ago, when Helen told her she wanted to write children’s books.\nTogether they went on to publish fifteen titles.\nShe knew what it was to feel vulnerable and to be able to turn that into humour. She had an enormous amount of empathy for her characters in the books\nIt came from her school days - her creativity and observational skills as a child at school And all of that was tucked away inside her and waiting to come out.\n– ANNE MCNEIL, SENIOR PUBLISHER, HODDER CHILDREN’S BOOKS Helen's husband John died in Barbados in 2011. Credit: Family photo Helen’s skills as a writer later enabled her to connect with a very different audience through her blog Planet Grief.\nAfter losing her husband John in a drowning accident in Barbados in 2011, Helen wrote about the shock of being - in her own words - ‘a wife at breakfast and a widow by lunch.’\nI know what it’s like to feel the unrelenting pain of searing grief.\nTo long to spontaneously combust in front of the meal-for-one section in M&S, to stand in the park and scream into the sky, “Where are you?” and to sob hysterically over having to drag a slug-covered wheelie bin into the street, alone, late at night, week after lonely week.\n– Helen Bailey Helen wrote about her experiences at school. Credit: Family photo Followers found comfort in Helen’s honesty and humour, and the blog became so successful she turned it into a book called ‘When Bad Things Happen in Good Bikinis’.\nIn the book Bailey described meeting and falling in love with Ian Stewart, whose wife had died in 2010.\nShe referred to him as ‘GGHW’ (The Gorgeous Grey Haired Widower) and together they moved to Royston in 2010.\nHelen and dog Boris were inseparable. Credit: Hertfordshire Police Helen spent most of her adult life living in London. She wrote about the challenge of adapting to life in rural Hertfordshire, having ‘sworn she could never live anywhere she couldn’t hail a black cab’.\nThe couple’s next door neighbour, Mavis Drake, described Helen as funny, kind and caring.\nShe said Helen’s beloved pet dog Boris was always at her side, and that she would peer over the fence and wave whenever the pair of them walked past.\nMavis Drake talks to ITV News Anglia's Chloe Keedy. Credit: ITV News Anglia In an interview with ITV News, she described Helen’s reaction when Mavis had the old, dilapidated garden fence replaced with a new, taller one.\n\"The first day it was up she emailed me or texted me and said ‘I do not like your fence. NOT like it!\", Mavis said.\n\"Then she sort of softened the blow and said ‘only because I cannot now wave to you as I walk past!’’\nHelen Bailey thanked Ian Stewart in her final book. Credit: Helen Bailey Helen said she had found happiness in her new life in Royston.\nIn a footnote in her final book, she thanks ‘my Gorgeous Grey Haired Widower, Ian Stewart: BB, I love you. You are my happy ending.’\nIt was, of course, an ending anything but happy for a woman who helped so many to make sense of their own losses, and whose murder has left them struggling to comprehend hers.\nFiancé guilty of murdering author Helen Bailey Last updated Wed 22 Feb 2017 Read more 43 updates Fiancé guilty of murdering author Helen Bailey Royston Hertfordshire", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ChloeKeedyITV"], "published": "2017-02-22T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:36:20.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
