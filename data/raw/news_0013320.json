(Source: IE image) Slamming the poor state of infrastructure in Madhya Pradesh, veteran Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor requested the Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan to look into the matter and work for it. Rishi Kapoor wasn’t happy with the roads and said that he is disappointed that when other states are having such high-quality roads, why Madhya Pradesh is failing to do so.\n“At a time when excellent roads are being constructed everywhere in India, highways and four-laneways are being developed, why such roads are not being constructed here (in Madhya Pradesh),” he complained.\nHe specifically talked about the Bhopal-Nagpur road and said that it is full of narrow lanes making the journey tough. Kapoor said, “This road which connects Bhopal to Nagpur is full of narrow lanes. I will request your (of Madhya Pradesh) Chief Minister to improve the roads in the state.”\nYou may also want to watch:\nRishi Kapoor reached Hoshangabad from Bhopal to attend a function and faced heavy traffic on the way. He said, “I have witnessed heavy traffic when coming from Bhopal. It was terrible.” Ironically, the road passes through Bhudni which is the constituency of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.\nThis isn’t the first incident where MP’s infrastructure has come under scrutiny. Earlier Bollywood actress Hema Malini and Raveena Tandon also expressed displeasure over the poor quality of roads. Rishi Kapoor had come to Hoshangabad to participate in a function to inaugurate a music institution but had to face protests from a group of saffron activists for his twitter confession about beef-eating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:26:42.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
