He made the rest of the team play better and his movement is very good. \n“The performances of Karim, Cristiano (Ronaldo), James (Rodriguez) they all made the rest of the team better.” Real Madrid's Karim Benzema celebrates after scoring.

I love to play here, I can’t say any more than that.” \nBut he’s been waiting for his moment. He’s previously told Marca that he’s: “been practicing those kinds of shots a lot.” Real fight back past Napoli 0:57 \nNEYMAR: CHAMPIONS LEAGUE PROGRESS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE \nBarcelona’s Brazil star Neymar says it will be a virtual ‘mission impossible’ for the Spanish giants to progress in the Champions League after their 4-0 first leg demolition by Paris Saint-Germain. \nNo team has ever come back from a 4-0 first leg deficit to remain in the Champions League and Barcelona are under no illusions about the mountain they will have to climb for the second leg of the last 16 clash at Camp Nou on March 8. \n“Now we have to think about the return match and see what we can try to do to reverse this situation,” the Brazilian star told journalists. Barcelona's Brazilian forward Neymar (C). Source: AFP \n“But it will be very difficult, practically impossible. However, we can’t give up. \n“It will be very difficult to prepare for the return match, with a four-goal deficit. I don’t think this has ever happened to me.” He said that Barcelona had not prepared well for the game but were still surprised by the punishment they had received. \n“We were not good, we did not do our work as we should have done and we were surprised by this result,” he said. \nThe joint heaviest defeat in coach Enrique’s three seasons in charge means Barcelona face missing out on the quarter-finals for the first time since losing on away goals to Liverpool in the last 16 in 2006/07.
