The queen's office released a 2014 portrait showing her wearing a suite of sapphire jewelry she received from King George VI as a wedding gift in 1947. \nThe Queen, 90, has cut back on international tours but still regularly performs official duties around Britain. In December she said she would reduce the number of her patronages, passing on her role at dozens of charities, academic institutions and sporting groups to other members of the royal family. \nShe will spend the day at her residence in Sandringham, eastern England, as is usual, her office said. \n(Reporting by William James; editing by John Stonestreet) Next In World News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:25:06.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
