Ms Vetrano was captured on CCTV shortly before she died (Photo: Daily Crime Watch) \nDNA recovered from the victim's body and phone linked him to the crime after he voluntarily submitted a sample last week, the New York Daily News reports. \nThe sample allegedly matched DNA found under Ms Vetrano's fingernails. \nLewis also made \"detailed incriminating statements and admissions\" to detectives, said NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce.

I had some issues at home. I just lost it. When I saw her, I just hit her and kept hitting her. I hit her and choked her.\" Parents Phil and Cathy Vetrano speak to reporters (Photo: NY Daily News) \nMs Vetrano's parents were relieved after learning of the arrest. \nHer mother, Cathy, said: \"The demon must get his justice. We will see to it.\" \nMs Vetrano's father, Phil, who found her body, added: \"I'm not going to say it is a good day but we can move forward now. We know who did this.\" \nLewis was unemployed and lived at home with his mother, and was hit with three summonses, dating back to 2013, near the scene of the murder. \nPolice focused on him after analysing a 911 call made by someone who said he was acting suspiciously.
