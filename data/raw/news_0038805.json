known as “ping pong” - could scupper May’s plan of triggering the formal process of leaving the EU before the end of March. \nHowever, Lord Mandelson did accept that the Commons views must take priority over that of the unelected House of Lords, and so it may be that once MPs send back the legislation, peers wave it through. \nLord Mandelson, a former EU trade commissioner who campaigned for Remain, painted a dire picture of Britain’s future outside of the Single Market - the policy put forward by the Prime Minister. \nHe also predicted immigration would not fall after Brexit, despite the Government’s repeated pledge to get reduce net migration to below 100,000. \nThe current level is 335,000. \nLord Mandelson said: “At the end of the day, what we’re going to see in this negotiation is three things - we’re going to see less trade, you’re going to see Britain paying through the nose for the access that we want to negotiate. \n“But you’re also going to see, broadly speaking, I suspect the same number of migrants coming to this country as now, partly because already half of the migrants don’t come from the EU, they come from the rest of the world and in the case of those who come from Europe, we need them to fill jobs in our economy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T13:35:05.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
