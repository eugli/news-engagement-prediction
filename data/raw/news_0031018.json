Related Grammys 2017: The Complete Winners List The full rundown of who won what on Music's Biggest Night \nThe performance honored the 40th anniversary of the group's seminal Saturday Night Fever soundtrack and opened with Lovato embracing her inner disco diva as she belted \"Stayin' Alive.\" Kelly took the stage next and, strapped with a guitar, added some arena grandiosity to the disco flare of \"Tragedy\" (the 1979 cut was not originally on Saturday Night Fever , but later appeared in the musical adaptation). \nLittle Big Town followed with a gorgeous performance of \"How Deep Is Your Love,\" with the country group creating a lush mix of harmonies while the Bee Gees' Barry Gibb sang along in the crowd. Day took the stage next and wailed through a stunning rendition of \"Night Fever\" before all the performers returned to the stage for a final refrain of \"Stayin' Alive.\" John Travolta, who earlier introduced Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood, was conspicuously absent for the performance. \nAlong with the Grammy Awards tribute, the Recording Academy and CBS will host a full concert special , \"Stayin' Alive: A Grammy Salute to the Music of the Bee Gees,\" February 14th. Lovato, Kelly, Day and Little Big Town will all perform, along with Celine Dion, John Legend, Nick Jonas, Pentatonix and surviving Bee Gee Barry Gibb. \nOf the performers in the Bee Gees tribute at the Grammy Awards, only Lovato was up for any trophies, earning a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album for her album Confident .
