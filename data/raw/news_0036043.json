But which of the two soaps will you be tuning into? \nDue to an episode recently being replaced by football, EastEnders have an hour long episode tonight which picks up from where the previous episode left off. Lee Carter has done a bunk leaving Whitney alone while Michelle Fowler has been stunned by the arrival of her overseas – and much younger – boyfriend Preston. (Picture: BBC) \nThe episode kicks off at 7:30pm while Emmerdale’s second episode commences from 8pm, meaning both will be airing at the same time. \nEmmerdale’s action focuses on the aftermath of the cab fire started by Emma Barton and also the Thomas family preparing for Ashley’s move into full time care. \nBut where do your loyalties lie? \nObviously, with catch up TV and online viewing, soap clashes aren’t the problem for viewers that they used to be but both soaps are bound to want the kudos of being the one that most people watched live.
