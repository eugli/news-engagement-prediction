Ad Feedback \n\"I think the council is better placed to get value for the community ... than a developer would be able to get for the commercial value from it.\" \nThe rural-zoned land was not suitable for higher density development and would make no significant difference to housing supply, he said. \n\"It's also a key to achieving a long overdue completion of the northern reserves, which are currently under-represented in the outer green belt.\" \nIf the council decided not to buy it, the group would consider fundraising and approaching the vendor to ask for a delay in the sale. \nA walking track through the Forest of Tane, connects Tawa with the Spicer Forest Reserve and Wellington's outer green belt, Te Araroa National Walkway, and Colonial Knob. \nGilberd, who is the city scientist and natural environment portfolio leader, said Tawa bush was well-recognised as an important corridor for migrating birdlife, connecting with Zealandia, Kapiti and Mana Islands, and other major reserve areas. \nAbout 200 Tawa residents attended a meeting on Sunday where Wellington Mayor Justin Lester and councillors were asked to acquire the land. \nResidents were told the city council had previously sought to buy the forest, with the intention of adding it to the Wellington Outer Green Belt and the area was listed in the council database for 'protection'. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:15:32.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
