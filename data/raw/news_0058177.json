The motorist was travelling in the middle lane of a busy motorway in South Korea when the lorry they were in began to skid. And just seconds later it had managed to cross over into the inside lane - terrifying the motorists who were driving at speed behind it. It then careered across the busy road and approached the cars which were in the fast line just feet away. The lorry was being driven on a busy motorway in South Korea and the driver seemed to lose control It went from the middle lane, to the right lane and then quickly started to head left at speed The lorry approached a saloon vehicle and headed straight towards it - only for the motorist to quickly speed away when it was inches from it. Remarkably, the heavy goods vehicle managed to level itself out and landed back on its four wheels before it crashed into the central reservation.
