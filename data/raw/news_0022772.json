Read more Suriya’s SI3, third part of Singam franchise, postponed again \nRaja, however, is reportedly going ahead with the release on February 9. \nEarlier, speaking at the audio launch of Vijay Antony’s Yaman on Saturday, Raja reportedly said: “ Singam 3 is releasing on February 9. A piracy website called Tamil Rockers run by a son of **** , pardon my language, has announced that he will live stream the movie at 11 am on the release date. We are still unsure if we can clear all the financial hurdles and ensure the film releases as per the schedule, but that ‘dog’ is very confident that he will live stream the film at the said time. And the industry is quiet and doing nothing about it, that includes me as well.” \nResponding to his statement, Tamil Rockers took to their Facebook page and said: “#Gnanavel Raja Nice speech sir #MarkYourCalender February 9th is not your day our day.. #TamilRockers.” \nRaja had also attacked the Tamil Nadu Producer Council for the body’s inability to contain piracy. It must be noted that Jayam Ravi, Arvind Swami starrer Bogan, which released on February 2, too had to suffer when the film was leaked online.
