After just a minute of play it looked like Merideth Deckard was aiming to shatter the record. \n“I know that when Kayana (Traylor) drives, they’re going to collapse on her,” Deckard said. “We’ve been playing since the second grade, so we can read each other and we know what’s going to happen. She can always find me.” \nDeckard hit back-to-back 3s to open the game, and would go on to it five more in the game, finishing with 25 points and one 3 shy of the record. However, it was more than enough to propel Martinsville (21-4) past Franklin Central to a 71-61 for its first sectional title since 2008. \n“She’s at the point that people know she wants to shoot the ball, and she has to earn every shot that she gets,” Martinsville coach Vince Cerbone said of Deckard. “For her to step up the way she did is absolutely phenomenal. Offensively, she and Kayana were the difference makers in the second half.” \nThe Flashes (11-12) weren’t going to go away easily, though, thanks to 19 first half-points from freshman Rachel Loobie. Franklin Central's defense held Traylor to only five first-half points, and the score was tied at 31 going into halftime. \nSecond-half adjustments were crystal clear with Traylor switching over to guard Loobie. She held her to only eight second-half points. Offensively, Traylor found her groove as well, scoring 17 second-half points, including 12 in the third quarter. \n“In the first half, we were all a bit passive,” said Traylor, a Purdue recruit. “In the second half, I just wanted to be more aggressive and kick it into the gaps if I could. I think I did that much better in the second half.” \nThe win advances Martinsville to Saturday's regional, where it will face host school Bedford North Lawrence at noon.
