From the Bachchans to the Khan-daan, the crème de la crème of Bollywood is slated to join the celebrations.\nThe décor will be European themed, highlighted by white and pink carnations. The hotel's nightclub will be reserved for younger guests while a separate banquet has been booked for celebs to unwind.\n\"When Neil and Rukmini went to the hotel on Tuesday to supervise the decoration, they ran into Amitabh Bachchan, who blessed them. So, the Bachchans are certain to attend. Bipasha Basu, Karan Singh Grover and Katrina Kaif are also expected,\" says a source.\n\nSketches of the outfits \nDesigner Manav Gangwani, who has crafted ivory and emerald green outfits for the newly weds from his 2016 Begum-e-Jannat collection, says, \"Neil and I share a special friendship, and he has attended quite a few of my shows. So, he always had in mind that I should design his outfits when he gets married. I am delighted to dress him and Rukmini for the reception. We chose emerald green since it is an unusual colour and suits his personality.\"\nThe outfits, although primarily traditional, have a modern touch, adds the designer, who had shown three options each to Neil and Rukmini to choose from.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T06:30:45.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
