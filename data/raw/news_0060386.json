(Supplied: Google Maps) \nMs Halley said government projections predicted a further halving of the bird's remaining population should the pine plantation be completely harvested. \n\"The modelling shows there will be a loss of 50 per cent of the birds over a number of years,\" she said. \n\"That's on top of the decline we're already seeing.\" We are tackling decline: Minister \nThe State Government acknowledged the decline of the cockatoo population, and said it was working on a strategy to aid numbers while fulfilling contractual obligations and preparing for a bigger human population. \n\"The draft Strategic Assessment of the Perth and Peel regions has a specific aim of arresting the long term decline of the Carnaby's cockatoo,\" Environment Minister Albert Jacob said. \n\"Under business as usual, the Carnaby's cockatoo will continue to decline. \n\"The landscape scale response of the strategic assessment is the best option to protect this species.\" \nThe draft contains several measures to protect the species, including the creation of 700 artificial hollows between Eneabba and Ravensthorpe and a commitment to replant 5,000 hectares of pines to compensate for harvesting of the plantations. \nMs Halley said the WWF welcomed the concept of a strategic assessment, but said the plan did not go far enough. \n\"It does not protect Carnaby's cockatoos at all,\" she said. \n\"We're going to see the impact of implementing that plan will be huge loss and potentially the loss of the Carnaby's cockatoos from the Swan Coastal Plain.\" Pine harvest must be stopped: WWF \nMs Halley said the clearing of the pine plantations needed to be halted until the habitat loss had been addressed, and urged Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenburg to intervene. \n\"The continuing harvest of the pines must be stopped until there is agreement on how to properly address habitat loss for Carnaby's cockatoos,\" she said. \nIn 2002, the state entered a contract with Wesbeam for the supply of timber from softwood plantations around the Gnangara Mound, in an effort to protect the valuable underground water supply. \nThe Gnangara Mound — which is located under the plantations — provides approximately 30 per cent of Perth's drinking water each year. \n\"Retaining large areas of pine plantations within Gnangara, Pinjar and Yanchep ... would reduce ground water recharge into the Gnangara mound,\" Mr Jacob said. \nMr Jacob said the state was continuing to work with the Commonwealth to finalise the draft strategic assessment in 2017.
