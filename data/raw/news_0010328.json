Led by guest conductor Markus Stenz, the orchestra turned in a refined and compelling account of Anton Bruckner’s Fourth Symphony, prefaced by Mozart’s C Minor Piano Concerto, with the Venezuelan-born pianist Gabriela Montero as soloist.\nThe Fourth is not the longest of Bruckner’s monumental symphonies, but it still occupies a considerable piece of real estate on any program. Spacious and leisurely, Thursday’s performance trod with a light foot. Stenz dispenses with the baton, relying instead on his two expressive hands, which seem to knead the music. If his beat is sometimes unconventional, the musicians clearly have no problem following. Infinite calibration of dynamics produced titanic climaxes that remained beautifully voiced and blended. In contrast, a pliant rhythmic pulse lent the symphony’s folk dance-inspired passages a delicate charm and poise. This acute symbiosis of concept and execution produced what may have been the most cohesive ensemble playing I’ve heard from the orchestra.\nDespite an unassuming stage demeanor, Montero is a commanding artist. Following the stormy orchestral turbulence that introduces Mozart’s concerto, her solo entrance was simple, filled with pathos, inspired. From that moment, Montero held her listeners in a grip that wasn’t released until she left the stage. We weren’t observers of Mozart’s tragic drama, but swept into it. The supplicating humility that alternates with eruptions of passionate intensity in the first movement culminated in a solo cadenza that Montero improvised on the spot, just as Mozart would have done when he played the concerto. In the slow movement, abetted by the orchestra’s exquisite wind choir, Montero created an island refuge of quiet calm. Its spell was broken by the variation finale, in which conductor, soloist, and ensemble together evoked a desperate, grief-stricken flight from destruction.\nMontero is a vividly imaginative improviser, a skill that has almost disappeared among contemporary classical pianists. After the concerto, in lieu of an encore, she asked for a theme from the audience on which she might extemporize. Someone sang the insistent opening theme from Mozart’s Symphony No. 40 in G Minor. Immediately Montero launched into an exploration of the elements of the tune, moving from a classical context, through intimations of Chopin and Rachmaninoff-like effulgence, arriving finally at a spirited ragtime stride. It was music created real-time before our eyes and ears, and it brought the house down.\nstyle@washpost.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:51:19.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
