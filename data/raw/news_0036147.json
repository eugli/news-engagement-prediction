In all instances, the women who did not wear a cooling cap lost all their hair. Both studies, published in the JAMA medical journal, were funded by companies which make the caps – Paxman Coolers and Dignitana. Dany Bell, treatment and recovery programme lead at Macmillan Cancer Support, said yesterday: ‘Losing your hair can be one of the most distressing side effects of chemotherapy and the impact on a person’s wellbeing and sense of self can be profound. ‘There’s more to treating someone with cancer than simply targeting the illness – it’s essential that treatment takes a holistic approach to ensure all aspects of a person’s wellbeing are managed. This study is promising as it suggests there’s a possible solution to hair loss. If you’ve been diagnosed with cancer, we would advise speaking to your medical team about the options available,’ THE ICE CAP IS CHILLY...BUT IT'S WORKING SO FAR Bland, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the end of last year, was fitted with a cold cap at Macclesfield Hospital When newsreader Rachael Bland was diagnosed with breast cancer at the end of last year she decided to prove that chemotherapy does not have to be ‘a big, scary, horrible thing’. And as part of her third chemotherapy session shown live on Facebook, the mother-of-one was seen being fitted with a cold cap. Mrs Bland, 38, who works for Radio 5 Live and BBC North West Tonight, said she wanted to present the experience of someone who does not look like a ‘typical’ cancer patient as she has kept her hair through three cycles. In the video, filmed at Macclesfield Hospital in Cheshire, she added: ‘My hair is still very bushy. I’m not allowed to blow dry it or straighten it because heat is bad for the hair. My hair is okay to brush through at the moment. It’s still hanging on.’ Of the cold cap, she said: ‘It is a bit like wearing a rugby player’s scrum cap. You have to make sure it’s nice and tight.’ Mrs Bland put a cotton pad on her forehead under the cap to stop the skin freezing, and took paracetamol and codeine to dull any pain from the cap, which is frozen to -5C (23F). ‘My head is cold – I won’t try and kid you that it’s warm,’ she said. ‘But I’m perfectly relaxed, – it’s not giving me a headache or anything.’ She goes on: ‘I hope that we’re showing here today that it’s not a scary, awful experience. ‘You just come in, get it done, and it doesn’t have to be a big, scary, horrible thing.’ Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, said: ‘Women with breast cancer tell us hair loss is far more than just physical and can have an enormous emotional impact – for some it is the most traumatic moment of their diagnosis and treatment. ‘So more time dedicated to working out how to reduce these distressing side-effects is essential. ‘However, it’s important to remember that a cold cap is not right for everyone. It doesn’t eliminate hair loss for everybody and can add hours on to an already draining chemotherapy appointment.’ Some 55,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK each year, and 18,000 of them have chemotherapy at some point. Most patients lose at least some of their hair, a gradual process which starts within two or three weeks of beginning treatment. It usually then grows back after chemotherapy has finished.
