This makes the petals act together like a parabolic reflector, focusing visible and infrared light on the flower centre. “The flowers act as heat concentrators,” says Doekele Stavenga of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, whose team discovered the trick ( Journal of the Royal Society Interface , DOI: 10.1098/rsif.2016.0933 ). Advertisement \nWarming the pollen-producing stamens has previously been shown to boost their growth and the chance of fertilisation, he says. Insect pollinators prefer warmer flowers, for instance, perhaps because it allows them to keep their own temperature up. \nButtercups get their bright colour from yellow pigments in the petals’ surface layer. But the petals’ shiny gloss is due to the double layer of air just beneath the surface. This reflectivity is what turns people’s chins yellow when they hold a flower underneath. \nSome other plants also warm their flowers. A few burn food like warm-blooded animals, and one rhubarb species has translucent leaves that act like a greenhouse. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline “How buttercups have hot sex” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:30:39.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
