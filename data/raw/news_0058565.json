Martellus Bennett (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:52 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:52 p.m. ET \nAfter the Lakers announced they had promoted Magic Johnson to president of basketball operations, many began to share stories they had about the Hall of Fame player. \nOne of those people with a Magic anecdote was Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett, who said he met Johnson when Bennett was a 21-year-old rookie with the Cowboys. I had a conversation with Magic Johnson when I was 21 and a rookie. Damn I wish I had that 5 minutes back. \nMORE: Martellus Bennett won't visit White House \nThe tweet was initially taken as a shot at Johnson, who led the Lakers to five NBA championships during a 13-year playing career. Bennett added some clarity about half an hour later, saying he was the one who wasted those five minutes. I wasted that 5 minutes. That same 5 minutes today would possibly be life changing. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 \nBennett then poked a little fun at himself, asking if he was \"that much of an a—hole\" that people mistook what was supposed to be a \"nice\" tweet about Johnson the wrong way. Am I that much of an asshole that even when I say something nice it sounds asshole-ish? Lmfao. Y'all crazy. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 \nBennett, who is set to be a sought-after NFL free agent, added that he had much better encounters with other L.A. celebrities. I also was once on an elevator with Tom Hanks, Olivia Wilde, Ben Stiller and a few others. I absolutely crushed that interaction. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 I once had a small conversation with Jackie Chan and Will Smith. Well that was really mostly with Will. I couldn't understand Jackie. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 But I had the feeling that Will Smith didn't understand him either so I didn't feel that bad. Just laughed when Jackie laughed and agreed — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:17:24.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
