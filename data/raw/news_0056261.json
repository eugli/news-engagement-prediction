It puts them at risk and through unnecessary stress.\nLuckily Lara was picked up by the dog warden and since then the team have definitely given her all the love she had missed out on on Valentine’s Day.\n– Amanda Sands, Centre manager To find out more about dogs that need rehoming visit the Dogs Trust website .\nLast updated Tue 21 Feb 2017 Animals Leeds", "external_links": ["http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/"], "published": "2017-02-21T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:29:23.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
