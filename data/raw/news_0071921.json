(RELATED: See how well the FDA is doing its job at FDA.news ) \nAnd yet, for many years, both the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have continued to insist, in the fact of all logic, that while mercury in fish is very dangerous, the mercury in vaccines (in the form of thimerosal) is perfectly safe. \nTheir consistent argument has been that while methylmercury, such as is found in fish, is very bad, the ethylmercury found in vaccines is fine. \nNow, two of their very own scientists have published a study confirming the exact opposite of that statement. The meta-review was conducted by John F. Risher, Ph.D., and Pamela Tucker, M.D., of the CDC’s Division of Toxicology and Human Health Sciences, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and was published last month in the journal Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology . \nThe study found that thimerosal is extremely toxic to humans , even at very low doses, and that it is actually more dangerous than methylmercury in some cases. It is, for example, more damaging to cell mitochondria than methylmercury. \nOne would expect that since the study was conducted by the CDC’s own scientists, its recommendations would have changed. Not so; the website and vaccination schedules remain unchanged. \nOne of the significant findings of the review was that methylmercury and ethylmercury carry very similar levels of toxicity for humans . Their chemical properties are alike, and they both cause serious disruption and damage to the development and functioning of the central nervous system. The CDC’s website continues to insist that the “two types of mercury to which people may be exposed—methylmercury and ethylmercury—are very different .” [Emphasis added] \nThe CDC has also consistently claimed that ethylmercury leaves the body very quickly, with the website asserting: “Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which is cleared from the human body more quickly than methylmercury, and is therefore less likely to cause any harm.” What did the study find? Not only does ethylmercury not leave the body quickly, but it also metabolizes into very damaging neurotoxic forms. \nSince doctors and pediatricians all over the country rely on the CDC to provide up-to-date recommendations based on sound science, the failure to amend their earlier statements with this new evidence in mind means that the agency is directly responsible for placing the health and welfare of millions of children at risk. \nBoyd Haley, chairman emeritus of the University of Kentucky Chemistry Department, and one of the world’s foremost authorities on mercury toxicity, calls this study “a nuclear bomb detonating over the CDC.” He notes that the study should be making international headlines. Of course, that just isn’t happening.

I regret to say that I gave these shots to children. The CDC led us all to believe that it was perfectly safe.” \nAnd shame on them for that. \nSources:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:44:48.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
