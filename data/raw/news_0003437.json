including some granted anonymity on safety grounds - want Parliament to vote on keeping Britain in the European single market.\nThey include Peter Wilding, chairman of the pro-Europe pressure group British Influence, who is credited with coining the word Brexit and Conservative lobbyist Adrian Yalland, who voted Leave and runs the Single Market Justice Group.\nThe case started at 10.30am this morning but by 11.30am the judges refused to give the green light for the new challenge - but the group could still appeal.\nMr Yalland and Mr Wilding said later in a joint statement: 'We were right to bring this challenge, and unless the Government gives business and the country the certainty it needs and deserves, it is highly likely we will be here again'.\nTheir legal action comes just a week after Gina Miller and others defeated the Government in the Supreme Court and two days since MPs voted in favour of legislation to pave the way for Theresa May to trigger Article 50 - the formal process of leaving the EU.\nNew court case: A new group of campaigners have today launched a fresh legal action to thwart Theresa May led by Peter Wilding, left, chairman of the pro-Europe pressure group British Influence and Adrian Yalland, right, who runs the Single Market Justice Group\nNew legal bid: Prime Minister Theresa May speaks with France's President Francois Hollande today in Malta, her allies have dubbed troublemaking MPs who back the newc ase 'the new b s'\nNigel Farage responded swiftly to the High Court decision to scupper the application, describing it on Twitter as 'Good News'.\nLord Justice Lloyd Jones, sitting with Mr Justice Lewis at a hearing in London, expressed concerns during the application hearing that the challenge might be premature.\nAnd James Eadie QC, appearing for the Government, submitted: 'This application is premature and should be dismissed for that reason.'\nPeter Wilding, head of the pro-single market organisation British Influence, laughs after posing for photographs outside the court - the case was blocked after an hour\nThe judges said they would give their reasons for blocking the application at 2pm.\nIt had been brought by campaigners including Peter Wilding, chairman of the pro-Europe pressure group British Influence, who is credited with coining the word Brexit.\nHe was joined by Conservative lobbyist Adrian Yalland, who voted Leave, and four anonymous applicants referred to as W, L, T and B.\nGeorge Peretz QC, appearing for Mr Yalland and Mr Wilding, said the case raised important legal questions regarding the UK's membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), which provides for the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital within the single market.\nMr Peretz applied for permission to seek a declaration that it would be unlawful for Prime Minister Theresa May to cause the UK to leave the EEA without prior parliamentary authorisation through a new Act of Parliament, and the serving of a withdrawal notice under Article 127 of the EEA Agreement.\nThe QC said it could not be done by the Government under the royal prerogative.\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union had maintained throughout that the case was unarguable and contended: 'Once the UK leaves the EU, the EEA Agreement will automatically cease to apply to the UK.'\nA single judge who considered the case in private last December refused permission to apply for judicial review, but the applicants exercised their right to renew their application in open court.\nToday Mr Yalland denied they were ignoring the will of the people and said: 'We do accept it (will of the people). I voted for Brexit but this is not about leaving the EU it is about leaving the EEA. If Parliament took us in then they should vote to get us out.\n'We were asked about whether we wanted to leave. If it wants to go beyond that they need to vote in parliament.\n'It's not about Brexit - it is a completely separate issue'.\nIn the same action are four people who granted anonymity because they feared for their safety.\nThe individuals, whose case could delay or even block the UK leaving the EU, have successfully argued their identities should be kept secret from the public.\nThey can only be called W, L, T and B.\nMr Yalland said today: 'I presume it is because Gina Miller suffered a lot of abuse. I have some sympathy for them but I don't think that applies in my case. I can handle it'.\nThe four anonymous applicants, who were either born in EU countries or married to someone who was, cannot be named after an anonymity order was granted by Mr Justice Cranston.\nThe group, who claim Brexit would leave them in 'limbo', asked for anonymity because of the abuse faced by millionaire businesswoman Gina Miller, who needed bodyguards as she took the Government to the Supreme Court over a Parliament vote to trigger Article 50.\nBut critics have said the public have a right to know who they are.\nUkip MP Douglas Carswell told MailOnline: 'In a civilised country, every individual has a right to take a case to court - and respected for it. But the rest of us should have the right to know who is trying to frustrate the referendum result. It's only fair.'\nNew Brexit case: Four people bringing a new High Court case linked to Brexit have won anonymity by a judge after they used the example of businesswoman Gina Miller, pictured with bodyguards at the Supreme Court last month\nRow: Mr Justice Cranston said the four had a strong case and made an order barring journalists from revealing their names. Ukip MP Douglas Carswell told MailOnline that the public has a right to know who they are\nTheir case has been described as 'Article 50's bigger and uglier brother'.\nThink tank boss and a Tory activist launch claim for judicial review\nThe director of a lobby group, originally founded by Lord Mandelson, instructed lawyers to begin the new legal challenge designed to thwart Brexit.\nPeter Wilding, above today, director of British Influence and Adrian Yalland, a Conservative lobbyist who voted to leave, want judges to consider whether leaving the EU means automatic withdrawal from the single market.\nThe British Influence think-tank, founded by the architect of New Labour and close ally of Tony Blair, wants to make MPs vote on whether leaving the EU means automatic withdrawal from the single market.\nIf it succeeds, it would mean MPs – many of whom are opposed to a 'hard Brexit' – would be given a say.\nLeave supporters say remaining in the single market would mean businesses would still have to abide by stifling red tape, and Britain would have to sign up to continued freedom of movement of people.\nLawyer David Golten, who is based at law firm Wedlake Bell, said: 'Potential litigation about Article 127 will make the Article 50 case look like a walk in the park'.\nHe added: 'The strength of feeling in Parliament and in the country about whether the UK should stay in the single market seems deeper than the feeling about membership of the EU.'\nIn a historic ruling, the Supreme Court declared that Parliament must give its approval to trigger Brexit under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.\nThe new case centres on Article 127 of the 'separate treaty' relating to the UK's membership of the European Economic Area (EEA).\nThe EEA Agreement provides for the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital within the single market.\nThe applicants are asking the High Court in London for permission to seek a ruling that Parliament must separately give permission before the Government can pull out of the EEA.\nThey want a declaration that it would be unlawful for Prime Minister Theresa May to cause the UK to leave the EEA without prior Parliamentary authorisation through an Act of Parliament, and the serving of a withdrawal notice under Article 127.\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union says the case is unarguable and contends: 'Once the UK leaves the EU, the EEA Agreement will automatically cease to apply to the UK.'\nA single judge who considered the case in private last December refused permission to apply for judicial review, but the applicants are exercising their right to renew their application in open court in a hearing before Lord Justice Lloyd Jones and Mr Justice Lewis.\nTheresa May's allies have dubbed troublemaking MPs who back the case 'the new b*", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-03T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T18:52:08.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
