Justice Fullerton said the Crown evidence did not prove this was true beyond reasonable doubt, and said Xie's wife Kathy Lee may have simply not woken up.\nThe Crown contended Xie was fuelled by resentment and humiliation at his perceived 'inferior' status in the extended family, as well as having a sexual motive which can't be published for legal reasons.\nProsecutor Tanya Smith submitted the only appropriate sentence is five life terms, saying the killings constituted criminality of the highest order.\nShe said the case involved 'a trusted relative slaying the family ... in the most brutal, callous and calculated fashion'.\nBlood splatter is pictured in the North Epping home in Sydney in July 2009\nThe bedrooms were 'awash with shed blood', an 'immediate and graphic indication to police of the severity of the murderous assault from which each had died', Justice Fullerton told the court on Monday\nA blood smear is pictured on a door knob at the family home in Sydney\nA footprint in blood is pictured in the Lin family home in North Epping\nXie still maintains his innocence.\nHis wife, Kathy Lin, believes he is innocent and continues to support him.\n'Families, friends, supporters and I keep support my husband,' Ms Lin said outside the NSW Supreme Court on Friday.\n'He is innocent, we believe that he is innocent, we keep fighting for him.'\nXie was born in China, where he was qualified as an ear, nose and throat specialist.
