Article continues below \nSpeaking ahead of Chelsea's trip to Burnley on Sunday, he said : \"Honestly - there are six teams that are very strong that can fight to win the title. \n\"We have [a lead of] nine points but if we think we are very close to winning the title that's a great mistake. We have 14 games left with five teams including Chelsea that can win the title.\" Article continues below Chelsea's XI on FIFA 10 vs FIFA 17: Ratings show there's only one winner \nThey say battles are won and lost in midfield and while Chelsea are very strong in that department, it turns out they don't possess the Premier League's best midfielder when it comes to playing against the top six. \nIn a recent study conducted by Sky Sports, statistics revealed exactly which player is most effective against England's elite sides. \nThe likes of Mesut Ozil, Kevin De Bruyne and Philippe Coutinho all featured in the top five, yet none of them finished top. \nInstead, it's Juan Mata who is statistically the best midfielder against the top six, as you can see in the interesting graphic below. \nIn 43 appearances against the Premier League's top sides, Mata has scored 13 goals and assisted a further 10 to record a minutes-per-goal/assist ratio of 148.6. \nCoutinho came second with a ratio of 172.5 having scored and assisted 11 and three goals respectively in 31 games, while Ozil finished third with five goals and seven assists in 25 games. \nThe biggest shock is undoubtedly Hazard, who is widely regarded as one of the Premier League's best players yet boasts a meagre minutes-per-goal/assist ratio of 230.9 having played 40 games. \nWhat's apparent is Mata is vastly underrated when compared to his fellow attacking midfielders, despite how well he performs against the top six. \nThe Spaniard has been brilliant under Jose Mourinho this season and it would seem his form has been inspired by his sheer desire to win the Premier League. \n\"I would love to win it,\" he told Sky Sports . \"I have been lucky enough to win so many trophies already. But I've been in England six seasons now and haven't won it yet. \n\"I'm 28 years old now and time flies. It feels like yesterday that I was playing in my first year at Valencia when I was 19. \n\"There are so many good and bad things that I've been through, flying through the years, so you need to sometimes take a step aside and think about what you are doing and what you still want to achieve. \n\"Because for me it's very important not to relax as a professional footballer and think I've won trophies with great teams and that is success.\" \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
