Trump in a bathrobe Twitter is the new worst Twitter \n‚Äî Mike Hayes (@michaelhayes) February 6, 2017 For the love of god, please stop referencing Trump in his bathrobe. It's like punishment for something I didn't do. ü§¢ \n‚Äî pjeanne (@p_jeanne97) February 6, 2017 \nThose decades-old photos of Donald Trump in a white bathrobe now clogging up Twitter timelines should blow over quickly, but they‚Äôre evidence that, as promised, the news media is back on the clock after an eight-year break and holding the administration to an unprecedented standard. \nIn a New York Times article published Sunday, Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman paint a picture of the new administration settling into the White House and touch on the new president‚Äôs evening routine. At night, Trump moves through the residence in a bathrobe, with Keith Schiller as only aide who occasionally pops up https://t.co/4sFV11e2Jo \n‚Äî Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) February 6, 2017 \n‚ÄúWhen Mr. Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone reaching out to old campaign hands and advisers,‚Äù they report, ‚Äúhe will sometimes set off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home.‚Äù . @maggienyt @GlennThrush story is a must read.

Obama only allows himself 7 almonds per night https://t.co/PoTvuj1eh3 pic.twitter.com/ltjGycgfKd \n‚Äî VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) July 2, 2016 \nOh, by the way, the president himself later explained that the whole seven almonds thing was an in-joke ‚Äî in other words, fake news. But that was before fake news became a serious problem. But back to Donald Trump‚Äôs bathrobe.

He's literally sitting in his bathrobe in the dark at the White House. \n‚Äî Paul Bradley Carr (@paulbradleycarr) February 6, 2017 Trump, who spent the campaign bragging about his stamina, stops working at 6:30PM and pads around in his bathrobe https://t.co/ujbsTlQgq9 \n‚Äî Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) February 6, 2017 time for a poll. the bathrobe that Trump wears is 1) Pink VS terry cloth 2) Garish satin w/his initials on it 3) Obama's that he left behind", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:43:37.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
