I understand this is a very sensitive issue,\" BBC reporter Yalda Hakim began. \"We know that an incident occurred which led to your separation, we also know you haven't said anything about this, but would you like to say something?\" Relive Brangelina's Best Red Carpet Moments \nJolie sighed deeply before she responded. “I don’t want to say very much about [the incident] except to say that it was a very difficult time and we are a family. And we’ll always be a family,” she said, getting teary-eyed and emotional. “And we’ll get through this time and hopefully be a stronger family for it.” Hollywood star Angelina Jolie (3rd L) and her children including Maddox Jolie-Pitt (C) gesture to media in front of the royal residence for a meeting with Cambodian King Norodom Sihamoni in Siem Reap on February 18, 2017.

According to court documents filed by Jolie, the Oscar-winning actor got into an altercation with his 15-year-old son Maddox . An FBI investigation turned up no evidence of such an incident, and the case was closed in November. Angelina Jolie's Best Red Carpet Moments \n“My family, we’ve all been through a difficult time,” Jolie said when asked about how she's been dealing with the stress of the split. “My focus is my children, our children, and it is — and my focus is finding this way through. And as I said, we are and forever will be a family. And so that is how I’m coping. I’m coping with finding a way through to make sure this somehow makes us stronger and closer.” \nIn September, shortly after the couple announced their decision to split, sources confirmed to Us that Pitt planned to fight for joint physical and legal custody of their six children. The Inglorious Basterds actor did get to see his kids for a Christmas gift exchange, but an agreement has yet to be reached. \nOn Saturday, February 18, Jolie brought all six kids — Maddox , 15, Pax , 13, Zahara , 12, Shiloh , 10 and twins Vivienne and Knox , 8 — with her to meet the king of Cambodia in Siem Reap.
