The shattered glass panel was cordoned off by SBS transit, the operator of the MRT line. \nWhen I took out my phone to snap photos of the damaged glass panel, an SBS staff stopped me and told me I was not allowed to snap photos of the damage. \nWhy is SBS transit staff preventing the public from taking photos of such incidents if they have nothing to hide? \nCheong A.S.S.
