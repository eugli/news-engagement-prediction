Picture: AAP Images\nIt is up to us as a rugby community and as his friends and family to honour his legacy and highlight who he was.\nWe have to let his two sons know what a wonderful man he was and how blessed they were to have him as their dad, and how proud he was of the boys they are and will become.\nIf they’re anything like their father, they’ll be a handful.\nWe’ll hold Sarah’s hand through this.\nVicks was passionate about his family.\nI remember the first time I met him. He came to training at Sydney University, this huge South African lad we called Big V.\n'He had such a presence' 0:59 Rugby: Members of the Queensland Reds remember Dan Vickerman.\nFebruary 20th 2017 a day ago /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Rugby Union/News/ 'He had such a presence' He could be prickly and awkward but as we got to know him we fell in love with him.\nHe was a big imposing bear that you wanted to be around.\nA giant of a man at 204cm, he managed to carry himself with a rare grace and poise.\nIt can be difficult for a man of Vicks’ stature to blend in because you stick out like a sore thumb, the largest person in any room you’re in, but he carried his size comfortably.\nWe won five club premierships together at Uni, and played for the Waratahs and Wallabies together.\nIt was during our Wallaby days that we became particularly close because we were roommates.\nVicks was always his own harshest critic. He’d play some outstanding games but nitpick over little mistakes, and back in the hotel room I’d tell him not to worry about it.\nThen we’d have a laugh about how exasperated the South African team was that, being fluent in Afrikaans, he’d decode all of their lineout calls and steal their throws eight out of 10 times.\nI went through a number of stages in Vicks’ life with him, from him being a single man to becoming engaged and then married to Sarah, a wedding at which I had the honour of being the MC.\nmedia_camera Dan Vickerman and Brendan Cannon together at a training camp.\nVicks was always his own man, too.\nFew realise just how much of a sacrifice he made to walk away from the game in 2008 to pursue a degree at Cambridge.\nHe’d been offered a very lucrative, long-term contract by the ARU, but instead chose to knock that back to study in England at a great personal financial cost.\nMost guys wouldn’t have done it, but Vicks said to me, ‘If I don’t I’ll always regret it’, and I respected him immensely for that.\nAnd he wasn’t a natural student, so for him to achieve an honours’ degree is a real testament to his work ethic and discipline.\nBecause he doubted himself, he didn’t think he’d play again when he finished his studies, but it goes to show what an excellent player he was that he was immediately called back to the Waratahs and was playing for the Wallabies within months.\nWhat most guys that played with Vicks will tell you is that he had a tendency to over-complicate things.\nOne of the funniest memories I have of him was when we were playing at NSW and forwards coach, the great Wallaby Steve Tuynman, would gather us around before the game and his final statement would always be, “be prepared for the unexpected”.\nmedia_camera Daniel Vickerman with the Cook Trophy.

Picture: Getty Images\nAnd each week Vicks would become more and more agitated by this, asking me ‘How can you prepare for the unexpected?’\nHe got very angry and even after the game he would come up and ask me ‘Why does he keep saying that?’\nIt was a huge irritation for him but it made me laugh no end.\nWe remained great friends post-rugby, his family and mine are close.\nAll I can think of is how the shadow cast by this great man becomes obsolete by the hole his absence leaves.\nWe are all devastated by what’s happened.\nUntil we meet again Big V, rest in peace brother.\nIF YOU OR ANYONE YOU KNOW NEEDS HELP, CONTACT LIFELINE ON 13 11 14 OR BEYONDBLUE ON 1300 224 636", "external_links": ["http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v2/origin:video_integrator.Y2Z2N2OTE6dJZ2KeDJRCj6e_wZHS_xYo?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e0a43bdf4242d2c8c7cf2933e25d7c20?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d7f5f410942cc796143a67e768a2c43f?width=650", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.js", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/0c0965e29d2fdb43a72a841aa113b348?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.css", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/63c81b72e5f9b871690a0064d7b65a6b?width=316", "https://www.beyondblue.org.au/", "https://www.lifeline.org.au/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6f4d19feee698e16baa5ce83921c10b0?width=316", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2FDVU_200217_RUN_REDS_ON_VICKERMAN.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc"], "published": "2017-02-20T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:52:15.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
