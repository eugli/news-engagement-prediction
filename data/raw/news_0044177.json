SUPPLIED \nDrivers had to do two laps of a roughly one-kilometre circuit around Pukekohe Domain in Waitara. \n\"Just total control. Drive to the conditions and hope like hell you don't hit a hay bale.\" \nDave Geraghty - driving a 1992 Mitsubishi Lancer - has won the street race once in it's now three-year history - and said his secret was knowing his car. \n\"I've had it for 14 years, I bought it after a breakup and thought I needed to treat myself,\" he said. SUPPLIED \nDanny Picard's car, a 96 Mirage Coup, was $1500 when he bought it 10 years ago. It's worth a fair bit more now. \n\"When you've had a car that long you just know how it handles, you know how to drive it. Ad Feedback \n\"It's my baby.\" \nGeraghty was sitting just behind Picard early on with a time of 2m18s for the two laps each car gets around the roughly 1km circuit around Pukekohe Domain in Waitara. SUPPLIED \nDave Geraghty with his \"baby\" a '92 Mitsubishi Lancer he's had for 14 years. \nThe event is run by the Taranaki Car Club and committee member Scotty Smith said Waitara was \"probably the best place to hold it\". \n\"The locals just love it, they come out in force to watch,\" he said. \nTestament to Smith's word locals lined the streets of the circuit, heedless of the rain, admiring the speed at which cars of all shapes and sizes covered the usually 50kmh speed limited streets. SUPPLIED \nA few cars suffered mishaps with the wet weather. \n\"They can get up to about 160kmh along the main straight,\" Smith said. \n\"But even though there's an overall winner they're mainly competing for a bit of fun, and of course bragging rights.\" \nIt's become a popular event, he said, and now it even has a waiting list. SUPPLIED \nCompetitors eagerly check their times to see if they've made it to the next round. \n\"There's not many opportunities round the country to drive on public roads like this. \n\"We're just lucky to get the council on board and have a community like Waitara so keen to have it here.\" \nSister duo Rebecca and Brooke Ray were driving a hot-pink Volkswagen Polo and driver Brooke said the key to handling the greasy roads was to \"take your time\". SUPPLIED \nDriver Brooke Ray and co-driver Rebecca Ray were handling the wet conditions well. \n\"That's nonsense,\" co-pilot Rebecca said, \"If in doubt flood it out. Just plant your foot.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T09:33:38.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
