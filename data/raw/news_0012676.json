(ABC News: Elise Fantin) \nHundreds of people have marched at Snug from a church service to the foreshore for a plaque dedication. \nAmong them were four siblings — Ron fletcher, Christine Nelson, Linda Barry and Jenny Rawle — whose mother Jean Gibbs died, leaving them orphaned. \n\"The people that mum used to work for in the apple orchard up the road from us, they adopted the four of us and kept us all together,\" Ms Nelson said. \n\"They were fantastic.\" External Link: Elise Fantin's tweet of Snug bushfire anniversary \n\"It's something you don't forget.\" \n\"We were all evacuated to the hall and we were singing, the teachers and that were pretty calm and they had the curtains drawn so we couldn't see what was going on\". \nMs Nelson said a school friend's mother took Ms Nelson and her two sisters to Snug Beach, where other community members were gathered for safety. \n\"She took us because she knew mum couldn't get down there,\" she said. \n\"As we were going down Beach Road power poles were just falling behind us, on fire. It was really scary\". \nA church bell retrieved from the ashes has been dedicated at the Snug service. Video: Snug before and now (ABC News) \nThe original bell of St Mary's was the only item to remain in the church grounds after fire ravaged the community in 1967. \nSnug residents who lost their homes in the fires lived in a temporary village at the town's oval. \nThe bell was also moved there, and was used to summon churchgoers from a range of denominations. \nParishioner Jeff Kevin says it became a signal of resilience for locals. \n\"I think it still holds a special place in people's hearts, I think it's one of those things that just reminds you what it was like on this day 50 years ago,\" he said. \nThe Snug commemoration also included the unveiling of a plaque which has been redesigned to include the names of two more victims. \nThe original death toll of 62 has been revised up to 64 after it was uncovered that the deaths of two others were not subject to coronial inquiries. Tributes from far and wide \nThere have been tributes from many quarters including state and federal politicians, as well as the Tasmania Fire Service, which paid respect to those who lost lives.

(ABC News: Elise Fantin) \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull paid his respects in parliament. \n\"The disaster received worldwide attention [with] President Johnson of the United States expressing his profound sympathy for the people of Tasmania and all Australians who had suffered as a result of this misfortune,\" he said. \n\"Time and again in the face of natural disaster Australians show grace under pressure, bravery in the face of danger and rally selflessly without a second thought, to help each other. \n\"Our thoughts today are with the people of Tasmania. Those who remember, those who suffered loss, those who rebuilt their lives.\" \nTasmanian Premier Will Hodgman said the event was forever etched in people's minds but it was also a reminder of the strength of the community. \n\"We also remember the bravery of our firefighters and our emergency services; the heroism of the volunteers; all those in our community that bonded in the face of the most catastrophic fires in our State's history,\" he told the Snug service. \n\"We take time to remember those who were lost. We share the grief of their families and friends who still suffer. We offer our support and we give thanks for the strength of our community.\" \n\"And we honour that today by reminding ourselves of the need to be vigilant and to be prepared.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:03:44.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
