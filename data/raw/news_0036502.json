She also wore him to the second inauguration.” Photo: By Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images. Hillary Clinton at the Inaugural Ball in 1993 While many were critical of Hillary Clinton’s fashion choices during her time as First Lady, her gown at her first inaugural ball made a statement. The beaded dress was purple, a nod to unity, and designed by Sarah Philips, a local designer from the Clintons’ home state of Arkansas. Photo: By Lynn Goldsmith/Corbis/Getty Images. Barbara Bush at the Inaugural Ball in 1989 First Lady Barbara Bush was drawn to a velvet and silk blue gown by Arnold Scaasi, so much so that she was sad to see it donated to the Smithsonian, telling Time , “I really hate to give it up.” The bold blue color was interpreted as a nod to the bipartisanship her Republican husband often tried to champion.

Nancy Reagan (with Princess Diana) at a drug rehabilitation center in 1985 During Princess Diana’s trip to Washington in 1985, both she and First Lady Nancy Reagan coordinated with the color red. Red was Reagan’s signature color, though, so Princess Di may have been making the diplomatic gesture here. Photo: By David Levenson/Hulton Archive/Getty Images. Betty Ford at the White House 1977 A strong supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment, Betty Ford posed on a table in the White House on her last day as First Lady while wearing a pantsuit—at a time when the idea of women wearing pants in the workplace was frowned upon at best.

Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson was thrust into the White House as the new First Lady. For her husband’s second inauguration, she chose a yellow gown designed by the relatively unknown American John Moore, to present optimism and hope to the American people.

Jackie Kennedy (with Charles de Gaulle) at the Versailles Hall of Mirrors in 1961 During a dinner at Versailles with the French president Charles de Gaulle, Jacqueline Kennedy wore a gown by French designer Hubert de Givenchy. But as Keogh points out, Kennedy was an enormous fan of French designers. “She wore a lot of French couture. Givenchy, Chanel, Cardin . . . when this was very hard to get a hold of,” she explained. “You often had to go to Paris and physically carry it back. Extraordinarily expensive. A single Givenchy voile blouse could be $4,000—in 1960 dollars!” Photo: Courtesy of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library.
