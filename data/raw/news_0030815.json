I probably did a bit too much with it too early and consequently went in to have all the garbage flushed out two Mondays ago and they’d found I’d torn it all up again so we started back at square one two Mondays ago.” Dermott Brereton on a happier day.   \nStunned by the amount of puss he was forced to drain following the operation, Brereton filmed a video on his mobile phone of him squeezing the blemish and shared it on social media. \nLike any trainwreck, it is difficult to look away. \n“That was one of about 20 times I had to squeeze the puss out of it,” he said. \n“It actually turned into a bit of a game.” \nThat’s not a game many people would ever want to play.
