'I don't think I have a chance of winning at all,' she said, adding that it feels 'incredible' to be nominated. Proud: The star was honoured for her services to drama Naomie is up against Viola Davies for Fences, Nicole Kidman for Lion, Octavia Spencer in Hidden Figures and Michelle Williams in Manchester by the Sea. Filled with excitement, Naomie said the experience of collecting her award from the Queen was 'lovely', and said the monarch asked her what she was working on at the moment. Naomie famously played Moneypenny in Skyfall (2012) and Spectre (2015), saying that she's expecting to go back to work with Daniel Craig on the next film 'I really don't think that they've moved on from Daniel,' she said, despite his cynicism about the role and the speculation surrounding a replacement. Smart: She wore a smart coat over a pretty dress, and teamed it all with kitten heel shoes Exciting week: Naomie is due in Hollywood later this week for the Academy Awards 'I think there's a very good chance that Daniel will come back. I think it's way too early to be thinking about other people at this stage.' The 40-year-old star added: 'If I was going to bet, that's the way I would bet.' Naomie has previously spoken of her desire to see Craig return as Bond following speculation he may leave the role - and now says that if she was a betting woman she would put her money on him to return. Earlier this week - the week Craig became the second-longest serving 007 - James Norton and Michael Fassbender were said to be the frontrunners to become the next Bond. Special event: She is nominated for an Oscar for her role in Moonlight Special day: Naomie looked gorgeous inside the palace, wearing Mary Katrantzou Harris said she thinks fans would be 'very disappointed' if Craig did not return to the role, adding: 'I think the fact that the last two Bonds - Spectre and Skyfall - have been the highest-grossing Bond movies of all time shows that people love him as Bond, and they desperately want him to return. 'And I don't think Daniel is immune to that as well, I think he's very aware of that, so I think that adds an extra level of pressure. But he has to ultimately do what feels right to him. 'But I know that we, as a cast, collectively want him back. I know that Barbara and Michael - our producers - desperately want him back, so I think the only person that needs persuading is Daniel.' Shortly after the release of Spectre, Craig said he would rather 'slash my wrists' than appear in another film as the secret service agent. But Naomie said that comment was 'just a joke' and that it can be difficult to translate jokes in print. Naomie has previously said she wants to continue appearing in Bond films 'for as long as they'll have me'.
