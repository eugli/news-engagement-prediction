He was tied with Sam Saunders, who did not have to hit a shot on Friday. Neither did Dustin Johnson, who needs a victory to have a chance at reaching No. 1 in the world. Johnson was 5 under and also did not tee off. \nPlay was to resume at 7 a.m. Saturday. \nThe tournament did well to finish off the first round Friday morning and get in more than five hours before a eucalyptus tree cracked under the wind beyond the 14th tee. The round was suspended to allow fans to get off the course.
