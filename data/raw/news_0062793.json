Danvers is the sixth character in Marvel’s history to be Captain Marvel, and has superhuman strength, endurance, and durability, as well as flight and precognitive abilities. That being said, there are plenty of those abilities already in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Larson told Yahoo Movies why Captain Marvel is an important addition nonetheless. Oh, my gosh,” she said to our Khail Anonymous . “Well, quite simply, she’s kind of like the bridge between these two worlds.

Larson also said that Captain Marvel adds another dimension to the lineup. “She’s coming to terms with these different parts of herself,” she said. There’s a lot of humanity in her, and she is such a strong believer in truth and in peace. I think that’s an incredible symbol to have right now.”\n‘Logan’ Director Explains Why He Didn’t Put Hugh Jackman in the Wolverine Costume: \nRead more: \nOscar Nominee Spotlight: ‘La La Land’ Star Emma Stone’s Busy Awards Season When the Oscars Get Political: A Look Back At Michael Moore’s Divisive Anti-War Speech in 2003 Oscar-Nominated Makeup Whiz Joel Harlow on Crafting ‘Star Trek Beyond’ Aliens, Marvel Superheroes, and Johnny Depp Disguises Tell us what you think!
