So you must have the port and you must have the industrial zone,\" he said.\nA source familiar with China's thinking said it may wait until May, when Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visits Beijing, to sign both deals.\nThe Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe previously unreported setback for Sri Lanka suggests Beijing is digging in its heels as it negotiates its global \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative to open up new land and sea routes for Chinese goods.\nSPEED BUMPS, MOUNTING DEBTS\nPresident Maithripala Sirisena is struggling to contain popular opposition to land acquisition for the huge Chinese industrial zone, including from Rajapaksa, who remains an influential opposition legislator.\nThe deal for the port development and industrial zone has also been challenged in court, which means it is stuck at least until the next hearing on March 3.\nAsked whether the agreement would be delayed until the court had ruled, Yi, the Chinese ambassador, said: \"Oh yes. We will follow the rule of law. We have the patience to wait.\"\nRajapaksa's role, the court case and violent protests by people afraid they could be evicted from their land underlined how Beijing does not always get its own way even in countries that badly need investment. Sri Lanka wants Chinese money to help alleviate its debt burden; the government had expected to have the proceeds from the stake sale within six months of signing the agreement before Jan. 7.\nSri Lanka has been under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to cut its deficit, shore up foreign exchange reserves and increase tax revenues as part of a $1.5 billion loan agreement struck in 2016. At least part of the money from the port deal would have gone toward paying down some of the more expensive loans on the government's books, some of which are from China, a senior Sri Lankan government official said.\nHambantota port and a nearby airport were built from 2008 by the Rajapaksa government with the help of $1.7 billion in Chinese loans.\nWhen Sirisena unseated Rajapaksa in an upset victory in 2015, he froze all Chinese investments, alleging unfair dealings by his predecessor.\nSirisena eventually negotiated a new deal with the Chinese government that involved the stake sale and further plans for the Chinese to develop an industrial zone.\nThe Chinese government expects to invest about $5 billion to develop the area within 3-5 years. Sirisena also agreed to give land to the Chinese on a 99-year lease. The terms did not go down well with port trade unions, which have asked the government to reduce the Chinese stake to 65 percent and lease period to 50 years.\nHundreds of protesters clashed with police in January when a demonstration against the planned industrial zone turned violent.\n(Additional reporting by Ranga Sirilal; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Paritosh Bansal)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:21:14.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
