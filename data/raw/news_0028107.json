Sometimes it is not possible but that’s our aim and our aim is to do that from now until the end of the season,” he explained. \n“We have fantastic quality in the team, great mentality and great character, but it is no good me saying that it is up to us to show that from now until the end of the season. \n“As players we take the responsibility as we feel as though we have let ourselves down, the manager down and the fans down. \n“Putting in that performance against Spurs doesn’t make up for it, but it is a start and a step in the right direction.

Before City played last night, there was just two points separating the teams from second to sixth, with only three of them guaranteed a Champions League place. \nThat is the minimum aim for the Reds this season, and despite the dismal run of one win in 10 games before vanquishing Spurs, Henderson believes the qualities are there within the Liverpool squad to mount a serious challenge. \n“You have to stick together. It was a tough time because we knew we hadn’t won for so long and performance levels were not up to standard,” he added.
