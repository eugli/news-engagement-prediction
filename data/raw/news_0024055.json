Slot to Georgia Links \nJake Fromm has every intention of becoming Georgia's starting quarterback as soon as possible. In order to make that happen, he'll have to unseat returning starter and fellow blue-chip prospect Jacob Eason . \nWhile those two will battle it out this spring and summer for the job, it hasn't kept them from realizing that they are ultimately on the same side and bonding as players and persons. \nA year ago Eason found himself in a similar position as Fromm. He was battling Brice Ramsey and Greyson Lambert for the starting job in 2016 but he also needed the two veterans. With coaches limited in the amount of time they can spend with players both on and off the field, Eason had to lean on the experience of those two in learning the offense. (Photo: Tony Morano, 247Sports) \nNow the sophomore from Washington finds himself in a different role. \n“A lot, actually,\" Fromm said when asked much time he spends with Eason. \"We’re really close and talking and communicating and helping each other out when we need each other.\" \nWith Eason now playing the role of veteran and Fromm as the newcomer, it creates an odd dynamic. At only 19 years old, Eason doesn't have a ton of experience at the college level. When compared to Fromm, however, the sophomore signal caller has seen infinitely more. \nThat's why Fromm says he's learning a lot from the guy who started 12 of 13 games behind center for the Bulldogs a year ago. \nBut the fact that both are still young isn't the only thing that makes the situation somewhat special. When all is said and done, only one of them, or Ramsey, is going to be asked to lead the Bulldogs' offense. Seeing as how Eason gained valuable experience a year ago, it'll probably be him. Still, he's charged with helping Fromm, a guy who's trying as hard as he possibly can to win the job. Eason certainly wants to retain his job, but he ultimately understands that helping Fromm get better makes the overall team better. Not a member?

But Fromm's experience thus far has taught him that there's a certain way to handle the situation. \n“You’ve got to do it the right way,\" Fromm said. \"It’s a thin line you’re walking on and you try not to step either way but at the end of the day, we are playing football. It’s tough. You’ve really just got to be sincere. You’ve got to be a sincere person and compete. Everybody is going to respect you for that.” \nOne angle that makes the entire situation easier is the fact that the two players have something in common beyond the position they play or the team they play it for. Neither will be able to play in Athens forever, so no matter what they do or who wins the job, the UGA staff is currently trying to bring in someone bigger, better, and more talented to replace them. \n\"That’s what coach (Jim) Chaney is doing right now,\" Fromm said. \"He’s looking for someone to replace me. That’s just the way it goes. It’s just college football now. You’ve just got to take it one step at a time and enjoy the time that I have.” \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
