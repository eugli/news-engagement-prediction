That sheepishness makes it seems likely it’s only a matter of time until the feature rolls out to more users. \nCredit: Phillip Chang [@m4au312 onTwitter] \nPersonally, I’ve been waiting for something of the sort for quite some time, as I often want to share more than one image from an event, but don’t feel like cluttering up my friends’ feeds. \nOf course, you can use already the company’s Layout app – not to mention a myriad of third-party apps – to create collages, but in doing so you relegate important moments to even tinier quadrangles on your already-tiny phone screen. Plus, I take pride in my photos and don’t want them to be diminished to such a minuscule presence. Carousels allow you to share multiple images from a single event in their full glory. \nThat said, it’ll be interesting to see how the company goes about implementing it. I’d imagine the amount of photos you can post in a carousel would be limited to just a few; advertisers can post a maximum of five. I think an Facebook-like album of 200 photos is probably too much for Instagram.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:21:07.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
