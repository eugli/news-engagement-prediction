She lived her life seeking to model her actions on her Saviour,\" the church said. \n\"She acted with grace and love, and when provoked forgave. \n\"She always thought of others' needs before her own. \n\"We give thanks to God for the precious time we have known her.\" \nOne church member, Mark, wrote: \"Words cannot express our sadness at the unexpected loss of Margaret. Such a wonderful lady who will be with us always in our hearts.\" \nAnother member of the congregation, Dorothy, said: \"Dear Margaret touched our lives in so many ways. \n\"She was a vital part of Rockdale congregation and it has been a privilege to know her. She will be sadly missed. Loving sympathy and prayers to Martin and family.\" \nMrs Goodwin's death comes two weeks after a young farmer was killed by a lightning strike in central western NSW while he was trying to protect his family's livestock from several grassfires sparked by a storm. \nCameron Cox, 22, died on his family's property in Moolarben , about 40 kilometres north-east of Mudgee, on February 7.
