SWNS:South West News Service Hannah shared pictures of the ‘bloodied’ chicken on Facebook \nShe said: “When I realised what we were eating I was absolutely horrified. \n“It was disgusting. \n“We have both had bad bellies for the last day or so. \n“It’s just not on – most definitely not ‘finger-lickin’ good’ that’s for sure.” \nThe mum of two and her partner Ashley Spalding, 25, from Anstey, visited the takeaway for dinner that evening. \nShe said: “It was strange because the drive-thru was really busy and when we ordered our food we were told there would be a 10-minute wait. \n“The server advised us to park up, but then when we passed the till they said our food was ready. \n“They must have just whipped the chicken in, got it out and served it to us.” SWNS:South West News Service 2 Hannah Schofield and partner Ashley Spalding outside the KFC restaurant in Leicester \nHannah said the chicken was hot and everything seemed fine as they ate a few pieces and put the rest in the fridge. \nBut when she bit into the leftover chicken the next day, she said her “stomach churned”. \nThe mum said: “I could taste the blood, it was terrible. \n“I thought ‘oh my god!’ – I couldn’t believe it.” \nAnd a shocked mum was revolted after finding her KFC chicken was “black and lumpy” under the skin. \nBakery shop assistant Hannah said she was just relieved that her children Maisy, six, and Lily, two, didn’t eat the chicken. \nShe said: “Fortunately, it was only Ashley and I who had the chicken and the kids just ate some chips. \n“It was the chicken thigh with the bones in that was the problem because the chicken breast seemed okay. \nHannah said she rang up the restaurant to make a complaint on Wednesday. \nShe said: “I was told I had to come in later and bring my receipt. \n“We went in that evening and took the chicken with us, but at first I wasn’t offered a £16 refund.
