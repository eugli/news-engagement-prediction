This outfit, with its double-breasted placket and nipped-in waist, was in line with the tailored and military-influenced separates that Trump has favored during the campaign and since entering the White House. This latest look furthers Trump’s penchant for sleek silhouettes in one-note shades. Her recent meeting with Akie Abe saw her in a Calvin Klein ankle-grazing dress, while to cast her ballot, Trump wore a Michael Kors sheath under Balmain’s tailored topper. Fast becoming the first lady's signature, a pair of killer heels grounded the look for a tonal finish.
