The planets, which are technically exoplanets since they are outside our solar system, also are relatively \"close\" to Earth, at 40 light years away. \nIn 2016, scientists using a ground-based telescope in Chile discovered three exoplanets not too far from the Aquarius constellation. NASA's Spitzer space telescope confirmed the existence of two of those planets and found five more. \nNATIONAL TOUR: Apollo 11 command module coming to Houston later this year \n\"This discovery could be a significant piece in the puzzle of finding habitable environments, places that are conducive to life,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the agency's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"Answering the question 'are we alone' is a top science priority and finding so many planets like these for the first time in the habitable zone is a remarkable step forward toward that goal.\" Trappist 1-F \nThis illustration shows the possible surface of TRAPPIST-1f, one of the newly discovered planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system. Scientists using the Spitzer Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes have discovered that there are seven Earth-size planets in the system. \nThis illustration shows the possible surface of TRAPPIST-1f, one of... \nSince the mid-1990s, scientists have discovered thousands of exoplanets. However, only about a dozen exoplanets are in the habitable zones of the stars they orbit. \nThe discovery of the TRAPPIST 1 system sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. \nScientists described TRAPPIST 1-E as similar to Earth in both size and the amount of light it receives from its star, an ultra cool dwarf. Because of the amount of light it receives, it could have temperatures similar to Earth's. \nTRAPPIST 1-F was described as a likely water-rich world that gets about the same amount of light as Mars does. TRAPPIST 1-G has a radius that's 13 percent larger than Earth and receives less light than the other two exoplanets. \nSeven Earth-sized planets have been observed by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope around a tiny, nearby, ultra-cool dwarf star called TRAPPIST-1. Three of these planets are firmly in the habitable zone. Media: MediaOS Video \nGROUND-BREAKING: Venus, once too hot to explore, now within NASA's reach thanks to new tech \nThe planets are all relatively close to each other. If you were to stand on the surface of one, you could see the other planets much more clearly than you can see Venus from Earth. \n\"This is the most exciting result I have seen in the 14 years of Spitzer operations,\" said Sean Carey, manager of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at Caltech/IPAC in Pasadena, Calif. \"Spitzer will follow up in the fall to further refine our understanding of these planets so that the James Webb Space Telescope can follow up. More observations of the system are sure to reveal more secrets.\" \nThe next phase of studying the TRAPPIST 1 system involves looking at the exoplanets' atmospheres. \nThe Webb Space Telescope, which will launch next year, will be able to detect the chemical fingerprints of water, methane, oxygen, ozone and other components of a planet's atmosphere. Webb also will analyze planets' temperatures and surface pressures â€“ key factors in assessing their habitability. \nBRITISH BULLDOG: Long-lost Winston Churchill essay reveals his thoughts on aliens \nNASA's planet-hunting Kepler space telescope also is studying the TRAPPIST-1 system, making measurements of the star's minuscule changes in brightness due to transiting planets. Operating as the K2 mission, the spacecraft's observations will allow astronomers to refine the properties of the known planets, as well as search for additional planets in the system. \nSeven Earth-sized planets have been observed by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope around a tiny, nearby, ultra-cool dwarf star called TRAPPIST-1.
