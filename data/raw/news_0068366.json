NZ Herald The coach carrying 32 people plummeted 100ft down a steep hillside NZ Herald Emergency workers rushed at least seven people to hospital with serious injuries NZ Herald 7 Firemen had to cut people out of the car which collided with the bus \nThe coach was carrying people travelling on the Celebrity cruise line’s Solstice liner who were enjoying an excursion in the beautiful hills near Christchurch. \nIt is not yet known if any of the critically and seriously injured casualties are British. \nBut hundreds of UK nationals are among the estimated 2,850 passengers on board the vessel. \nThe bus slammed into a car on a twisting stretch of road winding through the mountain range near the coastal town of Akaroa where the Solstice had docked for the day. \nThe coach was sent careering off 100ft down a steep embankment into the undergrowth. \nMotorists who were first on the scene scrambled down the bank to help the injured from the mangled wreckage as trapped tourists screamed for help. \nPassengers – some paying nearly £20,000 for luxury suites aboard the ship – had been taken ashore this morning for various excursions on a fleet of coaches. \nThe horror crash happened as the coaches were returning to Akaroa, where a fleet of small boats was lined up to ferry them back to the ship. Were you on board the ship? Do you know anyone involved in the crash? Contact Tom Michael at tom.michael@thesun.co.uk or ring 0207 782 4368 \nThe liner had been due to set sail to its next port of call, Dunedin, at 7pm local time – 6am UK time. \nBut as news of the tragedy filtered through, the captain announced that the sailing was to be delayed. \nPassengers on board the Solstice sat in stunned silence as they anxiously awaited news on their friends. \nMany British passengers rushed to email and phone relatives back home in the UK to reassure them they were safe. Brits feared among New Zealand bus crash victims on luxury cruise day trip \nOne UK passenger who asked not to be named said: \"Everyone is in shock – many of us had been on the coach trips that were laid on to take us to places like Christchurch when the ship moored at Akaroa this morning. \n\"People had a lovely day – the weather was hot and sunny – and we all got back on board the boat ready to enjoy our evening dinner when the news came through. \n\"We are all in a state of shock and the news about the victims doesn't sound good. \n\"We have been told that six people are in hospital and they are very seriously injured. We are all praying for them and hoping they pull through. \n\"I don't know if any of them are British but there are loads of people from the UK on board the ship and many would have been among people making the coach excursions ashore today. \n\"People had been looking forward to this holiday for months – for this to happen is dreadful.\" Related stories SITTING DUCKS Tourists among 30 feared dead in Italy avalanche 'tried to flee hotel after earthquakes - but disaster struck just minutes before snow plough could get through' TERROR IN THAILAND At least four people killed and dozens injured including British tourists after series of co-ordinated blasts rock Phuket and other resorts DEATH CAMP BUS SMASH Two dead after car crashed into Auschwitz tour bus with Brits on board BUS CRASH HORROR At least 32 dead as Taiwan tour bus flips on road CHILD HURT IN HORROR SMASH Four people including 12-year-old girl hospitalised after horror car crash BLACK MARKET BONANZA Record numbers of Brits are listing passports as lost or STOLEN after Brexit vote \nThe Solstice – currently touring New Zealand and Australia – left Auckland after picking up passengers last week. \nIts first port of call was Tarangua, where many passengers took coach trips to see where the Hobbit houses were built for the Lord of the Rings films. \nIt then sailed on to Napier and Wellington, arriving in Akaroa today. \nThe passage through the mountains to Akaroa from Christchurch features perilous hairpin bends where there is barely enough room for two cars to pass each other. \nThe bus, carrying more than two dozen passengers from the cruise ship, collided with a car on the winding road. \nReports said the coach careered off down a steep bank and ended up in the undergrowth just after 5pm local time. NZ Herald 7 The bus smashed into a car before careering off the road to the right of the image \nSt John Ambulance Controller Sean Lester said the two people fighting for their lives have been rushed to Christchurch Hospital by helicopter. \nAnother with serious injuries was also transferred to hospital by chopper, while four people seriously hurt and one person with moderate injuries were taken by ambulance. \nThe remaining 26 occupants of the vehicles involved – who either had minor injuries or escaped unscathed – had boarded a different bus, Lester said. \nThey were taken to Akaroa Fire Station for further assessment by paramedics. \nFirefighters had to cut at least one person from the car and the bus driver out of the wreckage, Fairfax reported. \nThree fire engines, at least four ambulances and at least one police car attended the scene. \nSenior Sergeant Vaughn Lapslie, of Christchurch Police, said there were 32 people on the bus at the time. \nHe was unable to confirm the nationalities of those involved. NZ Herald Two people hug each other at the scene of the horror crash near Akaroa \nA staff member at the nearby Hilltop Tavern said he took water to the victims. \nCamera operator Matthew Simons said he could see the bus about 160ft down the embankment and a blue wagon-like Toyota on the road. \nSimons said he believed he'd seen one of the bus passengers emerging but was unsure. \nThere was \"a whole heap of firefighters working around the bus\". \nFirefighters had to use cutting tools to open the roof of the small, light blue car. \nDebris from the smash was strewn across the road and the front of the car was mangled. \nPieces of the car were left lined up on the side of the road, resting on a bank. NZ Herald 7 The driver of the bus is understood to have been cut out by emergency workers \nPhotos from the scene also showed the wreckage of the bus lying on its side among the foliage. \nPeople could be seen scrambling to get to the bus to help those trapped inside. \nA crowd gathered at the police cordon around the next bend in the road, where three white buses and several cars were pulled over. \nA worker at the Hilltop Tavern said the crash happened just around the corner from the bar but said he couldn't see the scene from where he was. \nA customer told him multiple people were injured. \nHe said: “The hill is steep and if a bus went down there, it would be of concern.” \nThe Christchurch-Akaroa Rd is now closed between Summit Rd and Barry's Bay Rd, with cops re-directing motorists. \nThe Commercial Vehicle Investigation Unit and the Serious Crash Unit have been advised.

He has since recovered. \nAnd an elderly American woman who was on board in November was killed while riding a bike in Tauranga the day the ship arrived in the city. \nThe 71-year-old was struck by a truck near the harbour bridge. \nThe same afternoon a bus carrying passengers from the same vessel collided with a car on State Highway 29. The car's driver died after the crash, but nobody on the bus was injured. \nWe pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?
