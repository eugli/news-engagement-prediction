(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) Trump urged to put GPS trackers on refugees until travel ban decided By Paul Bedard ( @SecretsBedard ) â€¢ 2/6/17 8:00 AM Paul Bedard Washington Secrets The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/Bedard-3.jpg More \nPresident Trump and his Justice Department are being urged to go slow on appealing a court's rejection of their travel ban and follow Germany's example and put GPS ankle bracelets on visitors from the seven targeted nations until a final decision is made. \nA prominent legal expert said that the administration should wait to appeal until Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch gets to the court, giving Trump a 5-4 majority and in the meantime put the tracking devices on any refugee or visitor. \n\"Going to the Supreme Court now could result in a widely predicted 4-4 decision,\" warned George Washington University Law Professor John Banzhaf. \nWait instead, he urged, and in the meantime look to Germany's model of using trackers on those it suspects of having terror ties. \nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

It is also more likely to be upheld since it is far less objectionable than a total ban,\" he said. \nAnkle bracelets are currently widely used by law enforcement and immigration agencies and Banzhaf suggested that it can be expanded and would be accepted by the nation. \n\"There have now been several major terrorist incidents in which authorities pointed out that they were suspicious of the perpetrator, but did not have sufficient information to arrest him, nor the vast resources necessary to provide effective surveillance of everyone under suspicion. GPS systems incorporated in ankle bracelets permit one agent to track hundreds of suspects in real time, and provide computer generated alerts if he goes anywhere suspicious (e.g., near a nuclear power plant), meets with other persons likewise wearing ankle monitors,\" he said. \nPaul Bedard, the Washington Examiner's \"Washington Secrets\" columnist, can be contacted at Also from the Washington Examiner Bolton: Trump should 'tear up' the Iran nuke deal \nIran's ongoing tests of ballistic missiles has shown that Iran is in no mood to comply with the United Nations, and justifies a decision by President Trump to \"tear up\" the Iran nuclear deal, according to former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton. \nBolton, who Trump was considering for secretary of state during the transition, said new sanctions and tougher talk from Trump won't be enough to curb Iran's actions. \n\"Iran's continued missile testing on Saturday has given President Trump one more reason to tear up his predecessor's deal with the regime in Tehran,\" he wrote in the Wall Street Journal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T20:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T15:28:16.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
