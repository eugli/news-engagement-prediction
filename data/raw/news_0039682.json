Keep it up. \n— Tim Carney (@TPCarney) February 15, 2017 \nHrm. If that “section” of Twitter proves anything it’s that the media is a bunch of insecure babies who created Trump and can’t control him, sorta like Frankenstein. \nIt’s just gotten obnoxious really: She was doing serious, critical coverage of Trump when many journalists were laughing it up about how he'd be embarrassing patsy for Hill. https://t.co/9Mz0cc6BLs \n— Mary Katharine Ham (@mkhammer) February 16, 2017 Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:18:33.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
