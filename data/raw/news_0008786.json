Its statement did not mention the group's boycott effort.\n\"Each year we cut about 10% [of brands] and refresh our assortment with about the same amount,\" the statement said. \"In this case, based on the brand's performance we've decided not to buy it for this season.\"\nThe retailer still has some Ivanka Trump items in stock, a spokesperson said, and will sell through that remaining inventory.\nOn the company's website Thursday evening, the only Ivanka Trump branded items available were four styles of shoe, all being sold at a discount.\nShannon Coulter, who helps run Grab Your Wallet, said that number is down sharply from early December, when Nordstrom had 71 Ivanka Trump items for sale.\nDid planned protests scuttle Trump visit to Milwaukee's Harley-Davidson?

She said the retailer should disassociate itself from Ivanka Trump, because she had continued to campaign for her father in the aftermath of the tape's release.\nWeeks later, Nordstrom had remained a focus of the boycott group's effort. Earlier on Thursday, in fact, her group had asked its followers to call the retail giant's headquarters in large numbers.\n\"The cause and effect here is very clear,\" Coulter wrote in an email message Thursday evening, after Nordstrom announced its decision. \"Over 230,000 Tweets and who knows how many millions of dollars' worth of missed purchases later, they finally heard us.\"\nThe \"Grab Your Wallet\" campaign has now targeted more than 60 companies - a group that includes Trump's own golf courses and hotels, those that sell Trump-branded goods, and other businesses whose leaders endorsed Trump or donated to his campaign.\n\"The people who voted against Donald Trump may have lost at the ballot box, but they can win at the cash register,\" Coulter said. So far, they have removed five companies from the list, after they stopped selling Ivanka Trump's merchandise.\nIvanka Trump goes public about exiting fashion label and Trump Organization Rosemary Feitelberg | WWD Hours after her father lambasted American intelligence agencies and squared off with the media alleging “fake news” Wednesday, Ivanka Trump has set the record straight about her post-inaugural plans.
