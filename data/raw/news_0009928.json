Refugees are in fact subject to the highest level of screening of any category of traveler to the United States.” \nJolie, a United Nations special envoy for refugee issues, argues that not allowing refugees into the country is dangerous and ultimately could have the opposite effect of what we’re seeking: \n“If we send a message that it is acceptable to close the door to refugees, or to discriminate among them on the basis of religion, we are playing with fire. We are lighting a fuse that will burn across continents, inviting the very instability we seek to protect ourselves against.” \nAnd so she concludes, “Acting out of fear is not our way. Targeting the weakest does not show strength.” And then, speaking, seemingly to Trump, she ends the piece by saying “This is where I would hope any president of our great nation would lead on behalf of all Americans.” \nFor the full piece, head over to the New York Times . \n[image via screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
