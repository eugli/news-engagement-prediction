Trudy Harrison polled 13,748 votes for the Conservatives Credit: PA \nLabour's majority in the constituency at the general election was just 2,564. \nBut for an opposition to lose a seat to the party of power in a mid-term vote is extremely rare. \nThe last time it happened was the 1982 Merton, Mitcham and Morden by-election. \nWhile hailing victory in Stoke, Mr Corbyn admitted that Labour's message was \"not enough to win through\" in Copeland. \nAfter her victory, Ms Harrison said the result showed \"the people are ready for change\". \nShe told Sky News: \"I think we ran an extremely positive campaign and it was a campaign that represented the needs of this area. \n\"And I know this area because I have lived here all of my life. \n\"I think that, and the combination of Jeremy Corbyn's views on nuclear in an area which is so dependent on Sellafield and on Moorside, contributed to my win tonight.\" Gillian Troughton failed to hold the Copeland seat for Labour Credit: PA \nMr Corbyn said: \"Labour's victory in Stoke is a decisive rejection of Ukip's politics of division and dishonesty. \n\"But our message was not enough to win through in Copeland. \n\"In both campaigns, Labour listened to thousands of voters on the doorstep. \n\"Both constituencies, like so many in Britain, have been let down by the political establishment. \n\"To win power to rebuild and transform Britain, Labour will go further to reconnect with voters and break with the failed political consensus.\" \nFull election result breakdown:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:26:18.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
