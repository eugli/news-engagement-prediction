(HT file photo) \nRashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president Lalu Prasad has hit out at Prime Minister Nrendra Modi for his remark at an election rally in Uttar Pradesh that there should be no discrimination in supply of electricity during the festivals of Eid and Diwali. \nIn a series of tweets on Monday, Prasad said, “PM Ko Dal Aur dwesh Ki Bhavna Se Upar Uthna Chahiye. Unhe Takrar Ki Nahi Pyar Ki, Todne Ki Nahi Jodne Ki, Vinash Ki Nahi Vikas Ki, Baten Karni Chahiye”, Prasad wrote on his Twitter handle @laluprasadrjd. \n(The PM should rise above the feelings of party and prejudice. He should speak of love instead of confrontation, of joining people instead of dividing them and of development instead of destruction) \nThe RJD chief’s remarks came a day after PM Modi, on Sunday, addressed a rally in Uttar Pradesh’s Fatehpur, accusing the Akhilesh Yadav- headed Samajwadi Party government of playing the politics of discrimination among communities.. \nModi said, “If a village receives funds for a graveyard, then it should also get money for cremation ground... If you provide uninterrupted power supply for Eid, then you should also do it for Holi and Diwali, as well.\" \nIn another tweet, Lalu said,“Modi Kahte Hain Mera Kya? Jhola Uthakar Chal Dunga, Lekin Ye Nahi Bataya Ki Is Adrishya Jhole me Ambani, Adani Ke Alawa Aur Kaun-Kaun Jhol-Jhamele Bhare Huey Hain”. (Modi says he has no personal interest and was prepared to lift his bag and go away. But he has told us what all is there in his invisible bag apart from top industrialists). \nLalu further tweeted, in Hindi, “This is a dictator PM who will divide and destroy the country. You are the Prrime Minister and you should avoid talking petty and silly things”. \nHe said, “You are PM. Who has stopped you from constructing crematorium and waive off the farmers’ loan . The man with 56-inch chest should not mislead the country in a cowardly manner”. \nIn another hard-hitting tweet, Lalu said,: “The country has never seen a PM who puts party symbol on his chest and talks on religion and caste to provoke negative emotions among the people”. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:13:10.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
