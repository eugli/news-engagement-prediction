Twitter Polls are NOT best used for things relating to politics. Because the last election. Apparently everyone’s favorite USS Enterprise helmsman George Takei didn’t get that memo. \nSaturday saw the outspoken liberal taking to the microblogging platform with a question for his followers: “Trump says the media is the true enemy of the American people. So lets take a poll. Who do you think does MORE HARM to the American people?” He provided two possible responses: “The ‘un-fair’ news media” or “President Donald Trump.” \nAfter a few hours and upwards of 70,000 votes, the results were (pretty surprisingly) neck-and-neck. \nDispleased with those results (and what liberal wouldn’t be?), Takei promptly deleted the post altogether. His followers took notice, and, jeez, they weren’t happy. George Takei gets mad and deletes poll because he knew it was showing a positive result of Trump.Come on @GeorgeTakei play fair now. #Fact ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:54:20.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
