The couple has been living in Mumbai since 2010 and working as ‘sajjadanashin’ (caretaker) of a Sufi shrine in Mumbai. \nTheir counsel, senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, said there were no adverse reports against her clients during their seven-year stay in India.

The bench said it was for the government to take such decisions. \nArora’s request to direct the authorities to consider the petitioners’ visa applications “compassionately” and extend their visas for 10 days was also declined. \nThe couple approached the top court after the Bombay High Court gave no relief. \nSolicitor general Ranjit Kumar opposed their petition on behalf of the Centre before the SC. He said the petitioners had given an undertaking before the Bombay high court to leave the country, but instead they moved the top court. \nThe HC on February 3 had dismissed their plea against the November 11, 2016 order of the foreigner regional registration officer in Mumbai that refused to extend their visas without assigning any reasons. \nThe couple was living in India since October 18, 2010 on a valid X-type visa that was extended by the authorities from time to time. This category of visa is prescribed for persons of Indian origin and subject to conditions that he/she should not engage in any business or employment nor his/her name should figure in any ration card or electoral roll, the petitioners told the SC.
