As for what's coming in the years afterwards, horror fans can look forward to at least one big franchise finally returning. John Carpenter, director of 1978's Halloween , has announced that a reboot of his classic movie is in the works. \nOn his Facebook page earlier, John Carpenter announced that Halloween will be rebooted for a 2018 release, and he'll be working on it with David Gordon Green and Danny McBride. According to Carpenter, the two of them came to his office recently with Jason Blum, shared their vision of a new Halloween story and he was blown away by it. Green and McBride will write the script together, and Green will handle directing duties on his own. As for Carpenter, he will remain an executive producer and \"offer my advice and feedback as needed.\" However, he did suggest that he might do the music as well. \nThe Halloween reboot will slash its way into theaters on October 19th, 2018. Let us know how you feel about this classic being retold once again on the big screen in the comments below. \nMore to come...
