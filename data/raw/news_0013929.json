In it, Trump echoed Press Secretary Sean Spicer ‘s insistence that only 109 people were affected by his travel ban on seven countries that are predominantly Muslim. \nThat claim was disproven in short order when it was revealed that thousands of visas were revoked — and, in some cases, reinstated — because of the ban. \nIn the interview, the President insisted multiple times that the order was implemented in a “smooth” fashion and only 109 people were affected. \nHe also spoke about the “total disregard” he perceives Iran as having toward the United States. Watch above to see all of that plus the now-infamous comments about Vladimir Putin being a killer and America not being that innocent, either. \n[image: screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
