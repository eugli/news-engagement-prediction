Also an argument is made that if nominal rate of taxation is kept at a lower slab, more people will prefer to come in the tax rate.\"\nIt is not clear how many people the move would impact, but India has a long-running problem of collecting income tax.\nIn 2013, the latest year for which data is available, only 2% of Indians completed a tax return and only 1% paid tax.\nOther proposals announced in the budget speech included:\nCutting tax rates on small and medium-sized companies Banning cash transactions for sums above 300,000 rupees ($4440; £3533) Political funding reforms including a cap on the cash donated to a political party by a single source Nothing for foreign investors: Analysis by Shilpa Kannan, BBC News, Delhi Arun Jaitley had to do a balancing act between the need to stimulate India's growth and ensuring that the country's spending is under control.\nBut I've been at an event run by one of India's biggest business groups, the CII, and the mood is one of general disappointment.\nThe finance minister had promised to gradually bring down corporation tax from 30% to 25% - but he didn't do it last year and it didn't happen this year either.\nMany here are saying there was nothing in for foreign or domestic investors. They fear a flee of money from India.\n'Bright spot' India's economy is expected to grow by 6.5% in the year to March 2017, down from 7.6% the previous financial year, a key economic report revealed ahead of the budget.\nHowever, the country was a \"bright spot\" in the world economy, Mr Jaitley said, adding that the impact on growth from the government's cash crackdown would wear off soon.\nHe said the currency ban was a \"a bold and decisive measure\" and would leaded to larger GDP, more tax revenues and a cleaner economy.\nThe dramatic move to scrap 500 ($7.60) and 1,000 rupee notes was intended to crack down on corruption and so-called black money or illegal cash holdings.\nBut the Economic Survey, released on Tuesday and written by the government's chief economic adviser, admitted the rupee withdrawal had been bad for economy. in the short term.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9150/production/_93900273_mediaitem93900272.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/B860/production/_93900274_farmassamap.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-01T12:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:00:19.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
