Read more Somalia food crisis at 'tipping point' with country on brink of famine \nIn 2017 there is a credible risk of another three famines in Yemen, North East Nigeria and Somalia, said the Department for International Development (DFID). \nThe UK must respond to the crises facing these countries to “avoid catastrophe”, said International Development Secretary Priti Patel in a statement. \n“The world faces a series of unprecedented humanitarian crises and the real threat of famine in four countries. These crises are being driven by conflict and drought and we must respond accordingly,” she said. \n“Our commitment to UK aid means that when people are at risk of dying from drought and disaster, we have the tools and expertise to avoid catastrophe.” South Sudan: Soaring inflation sends prices skyrocketing \nSevere drought in Somalia, where civil war has raged for more than two decades, resulted in the world’s last major food crisis in 2011. \nNearly 260,000 people died of hunger – half of them children under the age of five – according to a UN report. \nDFID said that all the signs were pointing to a famine just as bad, or worse, in coming months. \nEmergency food will be delivered to up to one million people in Somalia, where ongoing conflict has deprived more than six million of reliable access to food and 360,000 children are acutely malnourished. \nNutritional support will be provided to more than 600,000 starving children and pregnant and breastfeeding women. \nSafe drinking water is also to be made available to a million people, and emergency healthcare for 1.7 million people.
