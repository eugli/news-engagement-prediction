Brown/Getty Images \nSinéad O’Connor has apologized to Arsenio Hall after publicly accusing him of supplying drugs to Prince “over the decades.” Hall filed a $5 million defamation suit against O’Connor for her comments. “I apologize for my Facebook posts about Arsenio to the extent that anyone thought I was accusing him of acting as Prince's drug dealer and supplying him with illegal hard drugs, or insinuating that Arsenio had something to do with Prince's death,” she told TMZ . “I sincerely apologize because those statements would be false, and I retract them unequivocally.” Hall’s representatives have reportedly said that the TV host will file to dismiss the lawsuit. \nAfter Hall initially filed the lawsuit, O’Connor replied , “I'm more amused than I've ever dreamed a person could be and look forward very much to how hilarious it will be watching him trying to prove me wrong.” She added: “He can suck my dick.” All of her original Facebook posts have since been removed.
