Defence procurement almost always takes years in India, although Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration has promised the military faster modernisation.\nLast September, India signed a deal to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets from France for around 7.8 billion euros ($8.30 billion), the country's first major acquisition of fighter planes for two decades.\nHowever, it trimmed back a planned larger order for Rafales after the two sides failed to agree on costs and local production terms, and India is now looking to other manufacturers to fill its remaining need for new fighters.\nTrump's criticism of U.S. auto and drug companies moving manufacturing overseas and then selling goods back to the United States has raised concern of a potential impact on Lockheed's offer to India, although in this case the factory would supply the Indian military rather than export to the United States.\nBoth Saab and Lockheed are participating in India's biggest air show opening in Bengaluru next week, hosted by the Indian defence ministry.\n($1 = 0.9411 euros)\n(Reporting by Sanjeev Miglani; Editing by Adrian Croft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T15:50:37.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
