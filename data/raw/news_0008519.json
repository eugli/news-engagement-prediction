Democrats on the committee voted against the measure. \nSenate File 2 bars state Medicaid funds for any organization that offers abortions. It also sets the priority for state family planning funds to state, county or local health clinics, along with non public organizations that provide healthcare. Organizations like Planned Parenthood that refer Iowans to other health care providers would be last in priority. \nHundreds of protesters from both sides were on hand in the rotunda of the state capitol outside the meeting room where the committee was scheduled to meet. \nDemocrats have said they'll fight against the legislation. Republicans are promising to pass the legislation in some form this year.
