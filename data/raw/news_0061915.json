Remember Me Comments of the Week (fourth week of February 2017) By AllK_Maknae 1 hour ago 2,671 158 8 0 \nBTS have been feeling the love from international fans.... but some are more extreme than expected. \nI'd be concerned because I'm sure the fans camped out for days on that boat and rolled on by like... \n\nIf you can even call these people \"fans,\" the comments beat me to it with the meme of the day. \nOur faces exactly. \nJo Kwon always goes the extra mile to look ultra fab but one reader made an excellent point when it comes to imitating Lady Gaga's fashion sense. \n*Lady Gaga's reaction after revealing her secret* \nThey don't call him the King of self-promotion for nothing. \nWhile some can find the joy in getting a limited edition JYP card, some feel quite differently. \nI'd only burn it if it were him in those horrid plastic pants. \nEvery Red Velvet fan is awaiting a Pringles CF.
