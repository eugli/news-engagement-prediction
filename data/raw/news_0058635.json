'I gained more weight with each baby, and with twelve babies, that added up. I ate whatever I wanted, however much I wanted. Charlotte (pictured with one of her daughters) says that she did not drastically change her eating habits to lose weight 'I told my husband that eating was the only fun thing I did, so obviously it had a lot to do with meeting emotional needs.' By the time she reached 258 lbs (18st) she said 'Enough is enough, I felt embarrassed by my weight.' 'I wore plus-size clothes and my belly looked six months pregnant. I couldn't fit in an airplane seat without my thighs spilling over into the next seat.' 'My knees hurt and I struggled with flexibility. I also had problems with blood sugar and constant exhaustion. Charlotte (pictured with her children) ballooned to 258 lbs (18st) after giving birth to twelve children but has since lost over 100lbs Charlotte says that she looked 'permanently six months pregnant' and was often reduced to tears while out shopping for clothes 'I felt like people pitied me, and I worried that my children were embarrassed by my weight.' The extra weight had a knock on effect on Charlotte's self-confidence leaving her feeling deflated after every shopping trip. She said: 'The main time it bothered me was in a dressing room mirror. 'I had to keep getting bigger and bigger clothes to cover my tummy and it was impossible to find a swimsuit. I almost always ended up in tears.' Once wearing a US size 22W (UK size 24) Charlotte now wears a US size 6 (UK 10) It was when her two oldest children were engaged to be married in 2007 that she decided to take up exercise. She said: 'I didn't want to walk down the aisle in front of people I hadn't seen in years, wearing a size 22W (UK size 24). 'I realised I needed to take better care of myself to be around to raise them and to be able to do things with them as they grew up.' That was when she took up T-Tapp - a form of exercise involving a series of movements designed to put the body in proper functional alignment. Charlotte said: 'I didn't have the emotional bandwidth to diet, with such a large family. 'By starting with T-Tapp, it inspired me to change my eating too and after a couple of months of exercising, I began to eat healthier. Charlotte with Teresa Tapp who devised the 15 minute workout called T-Tapp 'I liked that there were short workouts, and that it focused on inch loss. I cut my portions down half or two thirds of what I had been eating.' Charlotte worked out five to six days a week and lost what she describes as a 'life-changing' amount of weight. Amazingly Charlotte says that she did not dramatically alter her diet to lose weight and ten years after starting her execrise regime Charlotte is now a US size 6 (UK 10). She said: 'I am a different person, my older kids could tell you that. 'I gave me life-changing confidence. It was wonderful to have energy, be able to buy cute clothes, have flexibility and strength, and feel proud of my appearance.' Not wishing to reflect on her past Charlotte destroyed almost all her photographs of herself at a larger size. She said: 'It makes me sad. I look tired and stressed. I didn't love myself enough to care for myself at that time. 'Now I realize that you are worth taking care of. Love yourself - it's the only way to be able to love and care for others from a place of abundance, rather than scraping by.' Teresa Tapp, author of Fit and Fabulous in 15 Minutes, initially created T-Tapp to help cancer patients. Now her simple 15 minutes workout are helping people lose sizes and increase their health across the world. She said: 'More than a workout, my method can maximise muscle and fascia activation in every move you make with regular activity during the day, while you walk and when you exercise. 'It gives me great pleasure to empower others with the understanding how to achieve fitness success to look and feel better the rest of their lives. Like Charlotte, yes you can.'
