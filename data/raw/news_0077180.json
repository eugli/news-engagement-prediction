WIKICOMMONS \nThere are reportedly up to 15 pigs still alive on the uninhabited island. \n\"Right now it's blowing out of proportion with people, anybody bringing food there, anybody doing what they [want to] do,\" he told The Nassau Guardian . \nRead more: \n\"We have people coming there giving the pigs beer, rum, riding on top of them, all kind of stuff. That never happened, but lately [it has] because it's so big, and we are never really there all the time.\" A post shared by BELLA (@bellathorne) on Jan 17, 2017 at 10:50pm PST \nThere are still 15 pigs left on the beach, an uninhabited island about 80 nautical miles from Nassau. \nThe Bahamas Humane Society said investigations are underway after the pigs carcasses were reportedly found floating in the sea. \n\"It could just be a horrible accident where they ate something poisonous,\" society president Kim Aranha told Tribune 242 . Ad Feedback \n\"It could be malicious, but I don't really see why someone would go out of their way to hurt those lovely animals.\" \nThe island has become a major tourist attraction for people visiting The Bahamas after celebrities started sharing photos from the beach. \nDonald Trump Jr visited with his family in 2016 and comedian Amy Schumer posted a photo from the island just three days ago.
