It has got 122 votes and no one has disputed the number. It is legally right but not morally,” he said.

Media was not allowed to watch the proceedings and even the audio feed, as is the practice in the southern state, was not available. \n“Even before the trust vote, the Edapaddi government had little credibility. The presence of Opposition would have given more legitimacy to the trust vote,” said Prof Ramu Manivannan of Madras University. \nAll the 88 DMK members were evicted while eight of the Congress and one of the IUML walked out. \nEdapaddi, in fact, should thank rival O Panneerselvam for staying on and voting. \n“Had OPS (Panneerselvam) walked out and ensured that the entire Opposition stayed out and the verdict was 122-0, the message would have been far more damaging,” Manivannan said. \nPanneerselvam, who rose in revolt against Sasikala, could have formed a larger political alliance. “But then, his mentors have told him what to do but not how to do,” said Manivannan. \nOpinion is divided over the future of Panneerselvam, who turned a hero in public eye for his opposition to Sasikala taking over the government and the party after chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s death on December 5. \nHe has a tough job at hand -- to turn public support into a potent political force. \n“It will depend on him, how best can he salvage the situation with the public support but we also have to see how long this support lasts,” Raman said.

The election commission is looking into complaints against Sasikala’s election as the AIADMK general secretary. \nIf the order goes against Sasikala, all party appointments made by her would be scrapped. It will give a big boost to the Panneerselvam faction in the party. \nAs far as the government goes, said Raman, its initial days would be of an uneasy stability. \nIt would be a big achievement if the government would last for more than two years, said Manivannan, adding Tamil Nadu could face elections sooner than 2021, when the term of the current assembly ends. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:13:28.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
