Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \n\"So a four-year term would double the period in the middle when governments are willing to undertake substantive reform,\" he said. \n\"Four-year terms will help governments overcome some risk-aversion by allowing them to ventilate ideas, have a public debate and settle on rigorous policy solutions, rather than having to rush to action. We would need to think carefully about the implications for Senate terms, because eight-year terms appear excessive.\" \nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten has also reiterated his support for the introduction of longer, fixed terms but said the country faced more urgent issues. \n\"I'm a supporter of fixed, four-year terms. It's part of Labor's platform,\" he said. \n\"It's not the biggest issue for me right now though. I'm focused on jobs, Medicare and housing affordability.\" \nThe Labor Party's national policy platform states that \"constitutional reform should . . . allow simultaneous, fixed, four-year terms for the House of Representative and the Senate\". \nIn 2007, newly elected prime minister Kevin Rudd pledged a referendum on the matter - even committing $27 million to the cause - but later abandoned it. \nJohn Howard's cabinet considered a similar plan in 2006, while former Labor leader Kim Beazley mooted a deal to secure four-year terms, with the prime minister retaining the flexibility to set election dates. \nFormer Victorian premier Steve Bracks said longer terms would help restore some faith in politics. \n\"Uncertainty is always factored in around election times and it is even worse when you don't know when an election will be called. \n\"It was a popular measure when we brought it in in Victoria. I think you can easily sell this to the public as a fairer, better system, enabling governments to act with more certainty,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:21:05.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
