His order reaffirms a Feb. 22 deadline set by the Army Corps for the demonstrators to clean up and leave.\nEnvironmentalists and Native Americans who have opposed the pipeline, saying it threatens water resources and sacred sites, have faced a series of set-backs since President Donald Trump took office in January.\nA federal judge on Monday denied a request by Native American tribes seeking to halt construction of the final link of the $3.8 billion pipeline after the Corps of Engineers granted a final easement to Energy Transfer Partners LP last week.\n(Reporting by Timothy Mclaughlin in CHICAGO and Brendan O'Brien in MILWAUKEE; Editing by Tom Hogue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:19:20.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
