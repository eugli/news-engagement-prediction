Caldara was also present as the president and Abe played golf at Trump’s private club in Jupiter on Saturday.\nThe exact nature of Caldara’s responsibilities was unclear. He appeared to be a member of a team of local Republicans voluntarily assisting with the president’s visit, each of whom was wearing lanyards featuring a White House seal. Caldara did not respond to an email seeking comment.\nHowever, the 56-year-old former New York police officer, who was also chairman of the Trump campaign’s “ Florida law enforcement coalition ”, suggested publicly that he was helping to provide security for Trump.\n\nVincent Caldara with White House social media director Dan Scavino. Photograph: Screengrab \nIn one post to Facebook, Caldara wrote: “Welcome home, Mr President! Thank you for the weekend invitation. My team and I will keep you secure.” \nIn another, shortly before the president’s golf outing, he wrote: “We’ve got you covered.”\nThe former NYPD officer posted one photograph to social media in which he posed alongside Dan Scavino, the White House director of social media . In another, he stood wearing a dark suit and sunglasses beside the presidential limousine, nicknamed “the Beast”.\nAnother member of the Republican volunteer team, a car dealer named Ken Baker who also worked on Trump’s campaign in Florida , referred in his own social media posting to working on the “presidential detail” during the visit. Baker did not respond to an email and a phone call seeking comment.\nThe US secret service is responsible for the security of the president. Neither the agency nor the White House immediately responded to requests for comment. \nIn September last year, Caldara lost his job with Eastern Air Lines, flying Trump’s then running mate, Mike Pence, to campaign rallies, after the Guardian reported that he had been charged with a violent crime. At the time, a spokesman for Pence said Caldara had not been a paid employee of the Trump campaign nationally or in the state of Florida .\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vincent Caldara poses with the presidential limousine. Photograph: Screengrab \nCaldara pled not guilty after he was charged with battery in Broward County, for allegedly driving his car repeatedly at Jeff Shanley, a former friend and business associate, in Pompano Beach in July 2015. \nShanley ended up under the front section of Caldara’s dark blue 2002 Ford Crown Victoria, according to the police report. He was taken by emergency responders to North Broward medical center for treatment. \nA witness told police he called 911 after seeing Shanley struck by Caldara’s vehicle for the final time. The police report said that Shanley was screaming at the time. \nShanley underwent two surgeries to address injuries he sustained in the alleged assault. He received a spinal stimulator and a fusion of his right hand, which he became unable to bend.\nIn a separate case still active in civil courts, Caldara is accused of severely injuring a woman in June 2014 by recklessly driving into her with his Harley Davidson motorcycle in Fort Lauderdale. The woman is suing Caldara and seeking a jury trial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:30:45.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
