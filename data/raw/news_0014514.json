He listed as terrorists such groups as Free Syrian Army, al-Nusra Front, Jaysh al-Islam, Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki, Brigade Sultan Mourad. © Sputnik/ Iliya Pitalev Syrian Army's Operation Against Daesh Expanding 'Safe Zone' Around Aleppo He stressed that despited rebel groups reached an agreement with the Syrian government and were allowed to flee to Idlib many of them came back to resume suicide attacks.\nLast December, Aleppo was liberated from militants by the Syrian army with support of the Russian Aerospace Forces. The Russian servicemen have since been carrying out operations to demine the city. \nSince the beginning of the civil war between the Syrian government forces and numerous opposition and terrorists groups, including Daesh and al-Qaeda, which are outlawed in Russia, the majority of western officials as well as media outlets have been supporting opposition factions. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:12:48.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
