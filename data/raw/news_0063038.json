It was quite horrible.” \nFerrara and his African counterparts held Hive meetings to educate people on the impact of their methods and brainstorm ideas on how to change. Together, they built a communal kitchen outdoors — eliminating the health risk — and planted fast-growing trees that could be cut and used for cooking fuel, sparing the forest. \n“IDEAS For Us taught me that people can turn their ideas into solutions through their own imagination, creativity [and] culture,” Stephen Lavalah, a nonprofit leader in Liberia, writes in an email. In 2013, Lavalah spent four months in Orlando working with the group and has continued to collaborate on projects that replant the forest, provide safe drinking water and support hand-washing and solid-waste disposal — efforts that have enlisted thousands of students in his country. “I learned that wisdom is better than strength, and our future is brighter and better through practical grassroots-led actions involving everyone.” \nCastro, 28, now sustainability director for the city of Orlando – the second-youngest person in the nation to hold such a position – says he never imagined the journey his little club might take. After all, on its first try, university officials rejected its application as a student organization, saying there were already enough campus environmental groups. \nHe and his supporters decided to meet anyway. \n“It has exploded beyond our wildest dreams,” he says. “When Bill Clinton was here at UCF for the 50th anniversary commencement address, he spent over three minutes talking about our organization. … It was just incredible. I wasn’t even in the audience, but people are calling and texting me, saying: ‘Bill Clinton just name-dropped you.’” \nBut these days, what the group needs more than recognition is funding. Scraping by on family foundation grants, corporate donors and individual $36 annual memberships, it still manages to offer $1,000 micro-grants to help people with environmental innovations get them off the ground. But it wants to do more. \nFerrara, who came aboard full time a year ago, has just begun raising what he and Castro hope will be $5 million over the next five years — enough to create an endowment that would bankroll its grants and operations — and keep it from red-lining every few months. \n“We really believe we’re at a critical time in human history,” Ferrara says. “If what is happening in this country isn’t enough to spur you to action, what the hell will?” \nor 407-420-5503.
