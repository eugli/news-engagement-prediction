She had been rushing to declare her love when he fell to his death and now she is struggling to hold it together after losing both him and her beloved sister Celine in a matter of months. \nIt’s no small wonder that she starts to behave erratically and hit self destruct and, when she hits the bottle, she finds herself making a drunken pass at a Hollyoaks local. And with Goldie guessing that Cleo has developed feelings for Joel Dexter, could he be the recipient of her advances? And will it develop into more? (Picture: Lime Pictures) \nWhen Cleo decides that she needs a night out, she orders both Goldie and Sienna Blake to go with her and they soon bump into Joel, who is with his dad Warren Fox. As the drink flows, there are embarrassing consequences. (Picture: Lime Pictures) \nThe next day, Cleo is mortified by her actions – but how far have things gone and what will the aftermath hold for Cleo? \nOne to watch: Tuesday 7th March at 7pm on E4.
