By: Trends Desk | Kolkata | Updated: February 4, 2017 10:04 pm PM Modi and UP CM Akhilesh Yadav came up with new acronym for SCAM and people could not have enough of it. (Source: PTI) \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a rally in Meerut for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Election and took a jibe at the opposition saying that the BJP is fighting against SCAM. Wherein he derived a new acronym for the word to represent Samajwadi Party , Congress, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati . Shortly after his speech, UP CM Akhilesh Yadav too came out with his version of SCAM and said that the ‘A’ and ‘M’ in it stands of Amit Shah and Modi respectively. “Save the country from Amit Shah and Modi,” said Yadav. \nScams in India is not uncommon and people have seen crores of money swindled away. Be it the 2G spectrum scam or the Saradha scam or CWG scam, the word has always been used by political parties at rallies and been a top agenda in elections. But the world play and formulating new acronym with the word is surely a first. \nPeople on Twitter could not decide which acronym was better and who nailed his punchline. While many agreed to Akhilesh Yadav’s version, mostly everyone seemed to agree with ‘C’ representing Congress, given to the long list of scams during the two UPA regimes. \nMany users also wondered how the ‘A’ in the scam did not include Arvind Kejriwal . A user even wrote, “SCAM ke full form mein A for AAP ya ARVIND nahin bola. Sab mile huye hai.” \nNo matter which acronym won the battle on social media is hard to tell, but surely Tweeple had a field day coming up with their own acronyms. And it was not just restricted to SCAM. Few predicted that the AAP and Congress would come up with a new full form of BJP. While the parties did not come up with an acronym of their own, they certainly attacked the PM for the taunt. \nHere are some funny reactions to the Modi’s SCAM jibe.
