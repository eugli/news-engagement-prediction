A force that can affect the world at a great distance, cause damage and healing, bring objects to you, show you images of faraway lands, cast light in dark places, even – sometimes – bring the dead back to life. There used to be a name for a force like that; the name was magic. But of course, that flexible, useful, intangible power has now been our servant for decades, in the form of electricity. \nIn my novel, The Power , I imagine the changes that come to pass when all of a sudden almost all the women in the world develop the power to electrify – and electrocute – people at will. I liked the idea as soon as I thought of it; it seemed supple enough to bear some metaphorical weight, and less comic than giving women enormous muscles or the ability to emit poisonous gas from their nostrils. But the more I’ve learned about the history of electricity – fact and fiction – the more I’ve understood why the image of the electrified woman was such a perfect fit. It’s about women and magic, about women’s liberation via the promise of the “electrified home”, and about the way that electric power makes the weak strong. Although I hadn’t put this all together when I started work on the novel, I’m not the first person to imagine women’s empowerment as literally electric. \nThere’s a new exhibition at the Wellcome Collection, entitled The Spark of Life , which deals with all of these themes. It charts the changing place of electricity in our lives, our homes and our imaginations. It brings together objects as diverse as a voltaic pile – an original form of the battery – posters advertising the new electrified kitchen, and images of pylons being pulled upright by horses. These objects make that most mundane of events, flicking a switch, turning on a light, seem once again strange, wonderful … and ever so slightly magical.

There were also electric fish, whose power I became fascinated with when I was writing my novel – they’re just so odd, and yet the fact that they evolved on our own planet made the fiction of humans developing a power like theirs just a tiny bit more plausible. The electric eel might be the most famous – a shock from a fully grown eel can kill a human being, if not several. But the Romans were also familiar with the electric torpedo, or “ray fish”, which swims the waters of the Mediterranean. The imperial physician Scribonius Largus wrote in around AD43 that: “Headache, even if it is chronic and unbearable is taken away and remedied forever by a live torpedo fish placed under the spot that is in pain, until the pain ceases. As soon as the numbness has been felt the remedy should be removed lest the ability to feel be taken from the part.” \nThe electric torpedo fish was recommended to help with sore feet and with labour pains – like an early version of a TENS machine. No one knew how it worked, no one at that point linked it with lightning. All they knew was that it made a difference. Invisibly, silently. Magically. The medieval writer Albertus Magnus included it in his bestiary, in which he also listed turtles and starfish … and sea monsters and mermaids. In fact, there’s a wonderful book called The Shocking History of Electric Fishes by Stanley Finger and Marco Piccolino, which I can highly recommend if you’re interested in organic electricity.

You made her magical: a witch. That’s also the power women have in fairytales – the uncanny power of the inexplicable. And there has always been something weird and uncanny about electricity, too. \nYou might already be remembering Rider Haggard’s magnificent creation She (short for She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed), published in 1886. Here, the immortal goddess queen Ayesha waits for the reincarnation of her millennia-dead lover. Ayesha is a “sorceress”, but if you annoy her, you might find yourself “blasted into death by some mysterious electric agency”. Or one could point to Mary Shelley’s Victor Frankenstein who manages to do that most female of activities – birthing new life – via a process which he never quite explains but which appears to relate to electricity.

Photograph: Wellcome Collection \nIn the 1871 novel The Coming Race by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, the young male narrator falls through a mineshaft into an underground world – one of the “hollow world” kingdoms beloved by a certain variety of conspiracy theorist – where women are stronger than men, are the ones who pursue men romantically, and where people wield a force called “vril”. Vril is, the narrator tells us, both “electricity” and also “magnetism, galvanism etc … the unity in natural energetic agencies”. Vril can heal and harm, “it can destroy like the flash of lightning, yet differently applied it can replenish or invigorate … by this agency they rend way through the most solid substances … from it they extract the light which supplies their lamps”. Sounds quite a lot like electricity – and the link to female emancipation was obvious to Bulwer-Lytton. Because vril “brought the art of destruction to such perfection as to annul all superiority in numbers, discipline or military skill”, the old ways of warfare eventually fell away – and so did the war between the sexes. \nSurprisingly perhaps, Bulwer-Lytton’s novel was so popular in Britain at the time that the word “vril” became a synonym for any “life-giving elixir”. It’s still in the language today: Bovril is a portmanteau of “bovine vril” – that thing derived from cows that gives you life and energy. The founder of Theosophy, Madame Blavatsky, was a great fan of vril, and you can still find websites today explaining how Atlanteans mastered gravity via vril energy, capturing it in pyramids. \nBut maybe weirder than all that is the fact that electricity did, in a way, actually do what Rider Haggard and Bulwer-Lytton thought it might. It freed women. The Wellcome exhibition includes early depictions of the wonders of the “electrified kitchen” and booklets created by the Electrical Association for Women of the marvellous all-electric house. When whole nations were slowly becoming electrified, the promise was that this power would take on dull-but-necessary chores that had previously been done by women. Washing day now involved the press of a button. Dusting and scrubbing were replaced by an electric vacuum cleaner. And because it takes no particular physical strength to operate the electrical devices that now fill most of our homes, the most obvious difference between men and women – muscles and height – became increasingly irrelevant. Arguably it’s the electric home as much as various postwar social and political changes that enabled the massed ranks of bored, miserable housewives Betty Friedan addressed in The Feminine Mystique to rise up in search of “something more than my husband and my children and my home”. \nThe promise of electricity, since human beings first became aware of it, is that it could do something astonishing. It can make the weak powerful. It is the invisible force that we can learn to control. It is wielded not by mighty muscles but by the power of the mind, by tools and ingenuity. And there – as writers have known for more than a hundred years – men and women are entirely equal. \n• Electricity: The Spark of Life is at the Wellcome Collection, London NW1, from 23 February. wellcomecollection.org ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T13:02:27.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
