It was Angus Young is an orange vest!\n‚Äî Duff McKagan (@DuffMcKagan) February 8, 2017 Expecting airport officials, Rose and his band mates were greeted by Young wearing a hi-vis vest.\nThe aptly named Not In This Lifetime tour has reunited the band‚Äôs seminal core ‚Äî Axl Rose, Slash and Duff McKagan ‚Äî on Australian stages for the first time since the epic Use Your Illusion concerts in 1993.\nThe band looked happy and healthy at the Sydney gig. Picture: Dylan Robinson Source: News Limited\nAll the bad blood and lawyers‚Äô bills appear to be water under the bridge as the trio and an impressive support cast of musicians reminded us why stadium rock once was everything. Before Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran and Coldplay and One Direction made sports arenas poptastic versus dangerous.\nAngus Young.

They look, well, happy and healthy.\nAnd those among the 50,000 plus crowd in the grandstands were frustrated with sound problems as the wind swirled and Rose‚Äôs vocals were lost for the first half-hour.\nBut once that technical difficulty was sorted, man, what a gig.\nAfter a well-publicised falling out Axl Rose and Slash are back on tour. Picture: Dylan Robinson Source: News Limited\nThere was not one person in that stadium who did not lose it when the Gunners smashed out that perfect rock song, Sweet Child O‚Äô Mine or Live And Let Die or Civil War or Estranged .\nSlash gave us a glorious extended rock guitar solo bonus with Pink Floyd‚Äôs Wish You Were Here which segued into Layla and then the epic November Rain with Rose pounding the piano keys abetted by the weight of his rings bling.\nSlash treats fans to some of his trademark guitarmanship. Picture: Dylan Robinson Source: News Limited\nThe top-hatted guitar guru and his bassist mate McKagan were given plenty of time to shine with solos when Rose went off stage to change t-shirts and hats.\nAnd no doubt equal shine time was stipulated in the contract.\nBut it is almost impossible to be cynical about a musical event you feared may never happen in this lifetime, punctuated with the signature fireworks and pyro bombs.\nFans of Guns N Roses watch the show. Picture: Dylan Robinson Source: News Limited\nRose and his band mates were generous entertainers to their legion of true believers ‚Äî particularly during the call and response of Knockin‚Äô On Heaven‚Äôs Door and Patience crowd karaoke ‚Äî and there seemed to be a genuine camaraderie on stage.\nThe most obvious takeaway for a crowd who grew up in the halcyon era of 90s stadium rock is you can never go back but you can revisit.\nGuns N‚Äô Roses return to ANZ Stadium on Saturday.
