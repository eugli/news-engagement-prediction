Media caption The film was written in English by Welshmen and shot in Poland \nFilmed for just Â£4,000, with all involved giving their time for free, it had been listed in the best original screenplay of a foreign language film and talented new filmmakers categories. \nLooking at the budgets of the other films, from countries such as Japan, the US and Germany, Mr Phillips said it would be \"a miracle\" if it won. \nHe said they had just gone to the awards \"for the experience\", adding: \"It was our first movie, shot totally independently, nobody had ever acted. \n\"It brought so many people together with everyone working for free. It was a terrific project.\" \nWith about 30 children from Pen y Cwm special school and Deighton Primary, Blaenau Gwent, flown out to be extras, he said it was a good \"concept film\", an example of how communities could establish bonds through film. \nJudges said international exposure from winning could help promote it in the UK, Poland and other countries. \nIt is due to have a premiere in Legnica in April and has also been entered in Hollywood's Polish Film Festival.
