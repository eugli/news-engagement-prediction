How Your Emotions Can Impact Your Physical Health To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nAs it turns out, you aren’t just being dramatic. \nIn fact, there is a load of scientific evidence that prove breakups cause a lot of physical changes in the body and even the brain. \nWhile some of these physical changes begin the moment you and your now-ex call it quits, some take a bit more time to kick in. \nBut, all of them can be massively taxing on your physical and emotional health. \nSo when your BFF calls you eight times a day to check in on you, be sure to take her advice because your body and mind are both going through hell. You’re actually experiencing withdrawal. \nA 2010 study showed that missing your significant other lights up the same parts of your brain that are active in cocaine users who are waiting for their next hit. \nAt the very least, this provides all the scientific evidence you should need to block your ex’s number. Giphy You’re so sad that your muscles get sore. \nWhen you break up with someone you love, your body releases massive amounts of adrenaline and cortisol, the fight-or-flight hormones that kick in when you are in a life-or-death situation. \nHowever, having a surplus of these hormones when you’re actually not in physical danger can wreak havoc on the system, causing you to suffer from sore muscles that swell up from a massive cortisol release that isn’t followed by your body springing into physical action afterward. \nI guess this is why I only like cardio when my heart is crying. Your heart grows larger than its normal size. \nThis is not a drill. \nWhen you are going through a breakup, your heart actually enlarges temporarily in a condition identified by The American Heart Association as broken heart syndrome, which can lead to real cardiovascular consequences. \nSigns of broken heart syndrome include chest pain and an irregular heartbeat, and it is sometimes misdiagnosed as a heart attack. \nThe good news is, it usually clears up within a few weeks, but the bad news is, it can lead to short-term heart muscle failure. \n(As if you needed anything else to be afraid of, aside from the general panic of possibly dying alone.)

There can also be a bright side to a breakup. \nPeter Loffredo, LCSW and author of Full Permission Living , tells Elite Daily, Very often, what happens after a breakup is the codependent bond is broken[.] In terms of stress, it is widely known and accepted now that stress suppresses the immune system and throws the person’s physical and emotional body into fight-or-flight mode. A breakup can be stressful, but it can also be liberating. It can go either way, sometimes both. \nHopefully, after everything, that at least cheers you up. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
