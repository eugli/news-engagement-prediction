The attacks happened at two different Rikers jails in 2015 and 2016. \nThe correction officer he punched was giving him water at the time, officials said. He also allegedly splashed an officer with an unknown substance. \n“This defendant was notorious for his crime spree on Rikers Island,” Clark said. “I hope this serves as a deterrent and reinforces our message that crimes committed in the city’s jails will have serious consequences.” \nSuspect in 2005 NYC beheading says 'I'm not a monster' \nHenegain pleaded guilty to the charges on Feb. 2. He also pleaded guilty to promoting prison contraband for being found with sharp metal objects, and harassment for several other minor assaults. \nHenegain has been jailed at Rikers Island since June 23, 2014, when he was charged with second-degree attempted murder. \nHe was acquitted of that charge, but convicted of False Personation – a B misdemeanor which carried a 60-day sentence. \n“These sentences stand as a warning: If you attack individuals in our custody or members of our staff, you will suffer certain consequences,” Correction Commissioner Joseph Ponte said. \nMore victims likely tied to NYC man charged with murder \nCorrection Officers' Benevolent Association President Elias Husamudeen said the sentence was another sign that people who committ crimes in jail will no longer go unpunished. \n\"The COBA has for years called for prosecutors to serve swift justice to assaultive inmates who repeatedly commit criminal acts against our officers,” he said. \n“Today, justice is finally being served to this inmate and his consecutive sentencing totaling more than eight years should serve as a stark reminder to other inmates that they will do serious time for their crimes committed behind bars.” Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:18:53.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
