We understand that quite a number of motorcyclists are underprivileged and the government is concerned over its people,\" he said. \nMohd Razlan told this to reporters at the 'Free Petrol Top Up for Motorcycle' programme organised by FT MyPPP Youth Movement in Kuala Lumpur last night. \nAlso present was the movement's chief, Meshach JV. \nMohd Razlan said details of the free programme would be announced soon. \nEarlier, about 600 riders of 150cc motorcycles and below received free petrol at a station in Taman Seri Rampai from 8pm. \n- Bernama \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T02:52:15.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
