Bangladesh's most reliable pair put together 107 runs before R Ashwin removed Shakib to remain one shy of becoming the quickest to 250 Test wickets. \n\nRavindra Jadeja then removed Sabbir Rahman three overs before the break to peg Bangladesh back. At the tea interval, they are 246/6, still 441 behind which means India have more than a fair chance of winding things up and enforcing the follow-on today itself, though a lot will depend on how Mushfiqur, unbeaten on 47, approaches the final session. \n\nShakib, fresh off his double century against New Zealand last month, scored his 21st fifty and remained the prime reason behind Bangladesh's comeback. The left-hander was equally effective against spin and pace, and even though he was troubled by Umesh Yadav 's reverse early on, Shakib did not let his guard down. Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja got the ball to turn and grip, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar beat the outside edge more than once. But that wasn't to bog down Bangladesh's leading run-scorer in Tests. \n\nTwice he took Bhuvneshwar for two fours in an over; his aggressive intent dishing out a similar treatment to Umesh too. Shakib's confidence reflected on Mushfiqur. The pair has now added 466 runs in two innings. Despite numerous confusions between him and his partner while running between the wickets, the Bangladesh captain was willing to see off the movement and get his eye in. \n\nAshwin finally struck for India, when he drew Shakib forward and the batsman mishit to find Virat Kohli at mid-on. Mushfiqur seemed all but gone when a run out replay saw him unable to land his bat on the ground while putting in the dive. But the third umpire thought otherwise and Mushfiqur carried on. He played spin particularly well; was quick to judge the length of the ball and execute shots accordingly. \n\nIf after two days of being toyed by the Indian batsmen Bangladesh thought now was their turn to make amends with the bat, that objective didn't materialise initially. Having lost Tamim Iqbal and Mominul Haque in the gap of 20 runs, Shakib and Mahmudullah seemed to be providing assistance, before Ishant produced a length-ball that moved in slightly off the pitch. Mahmudullah played down the wrong line and was given out. A referral couldn't save him. \n\nBhuvneshwar and Umesh made the 14-over-old ball move as if it was brand new. Bhuvneshwar applied the early squeeze and the pressure mounted. Third over of the day, Bangladesh lost Tamim to a run-out to a horrible piece of miscommunication between the two batsmen. Returning for a second run, that was never there, Bhuvneshwar picked up a clean throw and didn't miss the stumps. \n\nUmesh operated on a probing line, regularly firing in at over 140. Bangladesh had a tough time and it was evident with Shakib looking all over the place. One of the good-length balls that straightened after pitching caught Mominul in front of the stumps. Seldom has Umesh bowled in rhythm, and today he showed just how unplayable he can be when he does. \n\nShakib and Mahmudullah took Bangladesh over the 100-run mark but it took just one over from Ishant to end their resistance. With the wicket, India introduced Ashwin from the other. Result: Bangladesh went four overs without scoring. India lost both their reviews. The first one when Virat Kohli referred a ball that seemingly seemed to be missing Mahmudullah's leg stump and then when Ashwin went up for a leg before shout to Shakib. \n\nBrief Scores: Bangladesh 246/6 (Shakib Al Hasan 82, Mushfiqur Rahim 47*; Umesh Yadav 2/61) trail India by 441 runs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T11:14:22.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
