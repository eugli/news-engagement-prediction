The print includes a Quote: from the president, but misspells “too” as “to.”\n“No dream is too big, no challenge is to great. Nothing we want for the future is beyond our reach,” the Quote: reads on the poster.\nThe page selling the poster for $16.95 was removed Sunday evening between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m., the Hill reported.\nThe Library of Congress described the print as one that “captures the essence of Donald Trump’s campaign for the presidency of the United States.”\nTwitter users were quick to point out the error, which remained accessible through an archived version available on the Internet Archive website.\n“No joke: Purchasable copy of Trump’s Inauguration Print, direct from the Library of Congress site. A 5th grader would’ve spotted this typo,” wrote one user on Twitter.\n“‘Captures the essence of Trump’s campaign’ ‘to great.’” another user said.\n“Get’cher official Trump print from the Library of Congress. Extra ‘o’ in ‘too’ available separately,” yet another user pointed out.\nThe Trump administration has produced a series of spelling errors in the short time Trump has been president.\nThe Department of Education misspelled the name of W.E.B. Du Bois as “W.E.B DeBois” on Twitter Sunday.\nThe department then misspelled its apology, saying, “Our deepest apologizes,” according to the New York Post .\n Big Government , Pre-Viral , Library of Congress , Poster , President Trump , Twitter , Typo", "external_links": ["http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fbig-government%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Ftrump-inauguration-poster-removed-library-congress-online-store-typo%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Trump+Inauguration+Poster+Removed+from+Library+of+Congress+Online+Store+over+Typo", "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/319170-trumps-official-inauguration-poster-has-glaring-typo", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fbig-government%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Ftrump-inauguration-poster-removed-library-congress-online-store-typo%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Trump+Inauguration+Poster+Removed+from+Library+of+Congress+Online+Store+over+Typo&shortener=bitly", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fbig-government%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Ftrump-inauguration-poster-removed-library-congress-online-store-typo%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Trump+Inauguration+Poster+Removed+from+Library+of+Congress+Online+Store+over+Typo", "http://nypost.com/2017/02/13/trumps-official-inauguration-portrait-yanked-for-glaring-typo/", "https://archive.org/", "https://twitter.com/usedgov/status/830774712846348288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:27:17.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
