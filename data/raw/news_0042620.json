We just weren’t sure where we were going to do it,” he says. He was drawn by the mixed-use development, proximity to the highway and surrounding population. The 90-acre mixed-use development at the intersection of Providence and Ardrey Kell roads in south Charlotte. It is being developed by commercial developers Crosland Southeast and Childress Klein. “To me it was a logical extension to geographically where we are,” Jon says. The Porter’s House is the newest addition to the Rare Roots Hospitality portfolio, which includes Dressler’s locations at The Metropolitan in Charlotte and Birkdale Village in Huntersville. They also operate Dogwood Southern Table & Bar in SouthPark’s Sharon Square. So what should you expect at The Porter’s House? “We’re trying to have very approachable food, great value and appeal to people on a broad spectrum,” Jon says. Chefs Scott Hollingsworth and Eric Litaker are behind the menu. There’s a broad selection of appetizers such as the tuna poke, fontina fondue, fried oysters and calamari and rock shrimp. Salads include options such as the cornbread panzanella, charred asparagus and Chophouse Green Goddess. Among the a la carte steaks is the 24-ounce Porterhouse, rib eye and filet mignon. Want to share? There’s a 36-ounce Porterhouse that’s sliced table-side and served with roasted potatoes and local vegetables for $84. But it’s not all steak. Entrée options include everything from sautéed grouper to veal chops and duck with an orange-rum buerre blanc sauce. The restaurant is working with local farm partners to provide seasonal sides. Guests should expect the warm ambiance, comfortable environment and personal service they’ve experienced at other Dressler’s locations, Jon says. “This I think are hallmarks people expect from us,” Jon says. The restaurant’s decor takes advantage of 12-foot ceilings. A white quartz bar, reclaimed wood and whitewashed brick provide a clean look. The floors are made from 109-year-old barn wood from Concord. Slate blue paint and orange light fixtures provide pops of color. Framed, black-and-white pictures line the dining room. “We definitely wanted a touch of upscale. There’s no question,” Kim says. Custom-made wood flags by Heritage Flag Co. adorn the walls. Each was created from Maker’s Mark bourbon barrels. The space also has a whiskey room for a more intimate setting. There’s also private dining space for roughly 100 — or can be broken down into three separate rooms complete with AV capabilities.. Overcash Demmitt Architects was behind the design. Turner Construction handled the upfit of that space, which was in the “seven figures,” Jon says. Jennifer Thomas covers retail, health care and education for the Charlotte Business Journal.
