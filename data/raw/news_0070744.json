The pilot's response to the emergency will be examined and any factors, such as fatigue, illness or health issues that could have contributed will be explored. \nThe investigation will be conducted as a systematic and scientific process. Everything that could have contributed to the cause of the crash will be considered. Many will be discounted. Some will inevitably be proven. \nThe investigator's findings will be solely based on the evidence from the wreckage, and from analysis of evidence external to the aircraft, such as maintenance documentation, air traffic control recordings, available film footage and, not least, the observations of the witnesses. \nThe investigation will be an arduous and exacting task given the apparent fragmentation of the aircraft and the post-crash fire. \nHowever, ATSB investigators are among the best in the world and I have no doubt they'll reveal the causal sequences that led to this accident, so that any lessons can be learned and corrective actions implemented to prevent recurrences. \nAviation is the safest means of transport in no small part due to the work of air safety investigators who shed light on the causes of those accidents which do occur. \nThis accident will continue that tradition, I'm certain. \nDr Geoffrey Dell is a career safety and accident investigation specialist who has conducted countless investigations over 35 years.
