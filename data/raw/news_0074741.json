This may well define the Jet’s (or maybe Woody’s) class. Feb 25, 2017 4:39 PM \nThere’s no sense to keep him anyways. belligerentbuc says: Feb 25, 2017 4:43 PM \nCome back to Tampa for cheap and play safety to revive your career. You can help vernon Hargraves become a shut down corner and bring a championship mindset! \nBonus: you get to showcase your worth as a Safety in the toughest QB division. Do good here and you get paid in 2018 and stretch your career for a couple more years. \nOtherwise, pack it in…you done son! thetooloftools says: Feb 25, 2017 4:48 PM \nMaybe Revis will be in jail for knocking two men out. I think that is a hoot. He will get PAID no matter what by somebody. He still has gas in the tank. The Jets are still a toy for the owner. It’s like Randy Lerner in Cleveland who finally sold the team when he had no tax breaks left. It is what it is. whispersd says: Feb 25, 2017 4:49 PM \nThis feels more like a “when” than an “if”. If the Jets don’t get out from under the Revis contract, 31 other teams will be laughing at them. They can’t pay him 15+M for 2017 based on his performance last year. intrafinesse says: Feb 25, 2017 4:53 PM \nBecause of the offset language it makes sense to release him ASAP. \nHowever, his complete lack of effort makes me think his heart is no longer in the game, and I wouldn’t offer him anything more than a contact with a low base with incentives. From Revis’s point of view, why play for that, since he’ll get 6MM anyway. He might just retire. Feb 25, 2017 5:01 PM \nJets will never beat Tom Brady again. Ever harrisonhits2 says: Feb 25, 2017 5:07 PM \n“Releasing him early gives him an enhanced chance to get even more than $6 million in 2017” \n2016 – 43 tackles, 10 assists = 53 total, 1 INT, no sacks, no forced fumbles and only 5 passes defensed. \nNobody’s paying him 6 million in 2017. He played old, slow and uninspired last season. \nMaybe he can get 2-3 million on the open market and be a #2 corner for one of the crappier teams. \nAs a comparison – Malcolm Butler 2016 – 48 tackles, 15 assists = 63 total, 4 INT, 1 forced fumble, 2 fumbles recovered, 1 sack, 17 passes defensed Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment.
