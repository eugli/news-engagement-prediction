PBS NewsHour will stream the audio. \nOn Tuesday night, a three-judge panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments in the legal battle over President Donald Trump’s immigration ban.\nThe attorneys general of Minnesota and Washington state have challenged the executive order, which bars refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days. The executive order also barred all refugees from entering the country for 120 days, and placed an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees.\nBut the ban has been mired in controversy since President Trump signed the order last month. Last week, a federal judge placed a nationwide stay on parts of the order, setting a legal battle in motion that could reach the Supreme Court.\nListen in tonight to a live audio stream of the hearing, where state officials and officials from the Department of Justice will make their case before the Ninth Circuit panel.\nREAD MORE: All of the changes to Trump’s executive order on immigration, explained \n  Donald Trump immigration immigration ban justice department refugees Supreme Court Syrian refugees PREVIOUS POST Executive power: A quiz  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:16:18.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
