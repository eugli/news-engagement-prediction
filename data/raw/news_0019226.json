A lot of things have happened on Surfers Paradise beach, but fortunately we've never lost anybody that's been swimming in the flags,\" he said. \nMr Anderson's wife of 33 years, Persis, said he threw himself into his business career and transferred that work ethic to surf lifesaving after he retired.

While I can still be proficient, and while still valuable, and while Persis is still tolerant, I'll go as long as I can,\" he declared.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:04:27.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
