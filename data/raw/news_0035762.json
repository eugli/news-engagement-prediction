SAY is my ultimate focus and priority at this point of time. \n“Through this, I will find ways and ideas to make the youth community in Selangor thrive. We are starting small but with a big heart, putting a lot of effort plus cooperation with all parties including the corporate and government sectors, I believe we can achieve something big together in the medium to long-term future,” he added. \nActivities for SAY Ignite 2017 will showcase opportunities that are available in four focus areas to help unearth talent at the grassroots level and provide a platform where youths can convey their ideas and give their input on issues related to their generation. \nThese will include workshops, motivational talks and a talent competition. \nThe workshops and talks will be conducted by SAY strategic partners from the private and public sectors, while the talent competition -- aptly named Selangor Youth (SAY) Ada Gaya -- is loosely based on the Britain’s Got Talent television programme. \nContestants must be between 18 and 35 years old and have to be either born, residing or working in Selangor and will be required to submit video entries. \nThe best 10 entries will perform at the semi-final stage, from which the top three will be selected to perform at SAY Ignite 2017. \nA panel discussion was also held during the launch event, featuring speakers such as Joseph Tan of Leaderonomics, Kakiseni president Low Ngai Yuen, Malaysian rapper Altimet and social entrepreneur Zikry Kholil. \nIn addition, SAY also has a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Hijrah Selangor, a state programme to provide financial assistance to budding entrepreneurs. \nThe partnership will help to further improve and enhance the disbursements of microcredits to young entrepreneurs in Selangor and provide them with opportunities to succeed in their business endeavours. \n“SAY Ignite 2017 is sponsored by Sunway Group, a SAY strategic partner, who themselves are very much attuned towards youth development through their education arm and various corporate social development activities.” said Sunway Group China chief executive officer Evan Cheah. \n“At Sunway, we take pride in being a master community developer that values diversity and inclusiveness of our communities including youth development which is central to shaping the future of the nation. \n“This effort is also in line with our commitment to sustainability guided by the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Through our partnership with SAY, we see an opportunity to synergise our efforts to reach out to an even larger youth community in Selangor, especially through SAY’s incredible initiatives.” he added. \nFor details, visit www.selangoryouth.com or search @SAYIGNITE2017 on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:54:11.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
