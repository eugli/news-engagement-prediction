Modi, who had won a Lok Sabha seat from Varanasi, has stakes in UP, the country's most populous state, both as an individual as well as the leader of the party. A win in UP will also be seen as an endorsement of demonetisation, a bold move to scrap higher currency notes overnight, that has faced intense criticism and caused untold hardships to people, especially those dependent on industries that run mainly on cash. \nWhile his self-description was a way of seeking the loyalty of the voters, it was also a riposte to his political rivals, the Congress and the Samajwadi Party. Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav, the leaders of the Congress and the SP, have launched a campaign in the state projecting themselves as the \"true sons\" of UP and, by extension, the more dependable candidates to run it. \nKhan took offence at Modi's flippant attempt at showcasing himself as a son of the soil as it undermines \"the spirit of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015, Chapter 8, Section 56 to 73\". The PM's remark, she said, betrays his lack of sensitivity to the plight of thousands of children waiting to be adopted and the parents hoping to take them in. In India, the process of adopting a child can turn out to be complicated, long-drawn and difficult. \nEarlier Priyanka Gandhi, who is Rahul's elder sibling and increasingly believed to be the real inheritor of the Congress's legacy, had snubbed Modi as well . Speaking at Rae Bareli, a Congress stronghold, she pointed out UP doesn't need adopted sons, since it has two of its own, her brother and Akhilesh Yadav, working for it already. \nBut the political tit-for-tat wasn't the end of the story. Within hours of the notice being served to Modi, a Ghaziabad couple in their 70s offered to adopt the 66-year-old prime minister as their \"fourth son\" as a sign of their allegiance to him. While there are legal hurdles to be overcome before their dream can come true, the move has taken the debate over lineage to another level of absurdity. \nAs political commentator Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay recently wrote in Firstpost , the fiasco over the \"adopted son\" remark is not only unwarranted but also makes little sense in the history of Indian politics. Politicians in the country, especially those in the Upper House of the Parliament, are routinely offered their seats to represent states they have no connection with. The classic example of this phenomenon is the former PM of India, Manmohan Singh, who held the office for a decade and is a Rajya Sabha member from Assam. \nSeveral other Congress leaders have fought and won from seats in states they don't originally come from, including Indira Gandhi, whose return to political eminence happened from a constituency in Chikmagalur in Karnataka. The debate over insider-outsider to a state also opens up a more recent can of worms, when the BJP had questioned Rahul and Priyanka's mother Sonia Gandhi's right to be part of Indian politics as an Italian-origin person. \nFor now, the possibility of PM Modi finding a new family in Ghaziabad remains suspended. Khan has assured The Telegraph there are ways of dealing with the offender should he refuse to apologise for his remark but she has faith that matters won't come to such a pass. \nAlso on HuffPost 7 Incredible Pictures From National Geographic’s Best Photos Of 2016 7 Incredible Pictures From National Geographic’s Best Photos Of 2016 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:21:00.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
