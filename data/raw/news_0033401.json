Dear parents: Teen Vogue is giving your daughters advice about what to buy friends after an abortion https://t.co/FwFUqY7p3S \n— Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) February 12, 2017 \nWhy would anyone EVER want to normalize abortion, let alone normalize abortion for teens? We should be working to PREVENT teen pregnancy, not making it more acceptable to just abort if you make a mistake. Teens deserve better than this! EVIL: Teen Vogue Article Offers Whimsical Goodies for Post-Abortion Girls by: @SweetieWalker https://t.co/Tk2Reb4luN pic.twitter.com/xDdue0jn5m \n— Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) February 13, 2017 Trending Sarah Silverman confuses surveyor's mark with a swastika? \nPer Teen Vogue : \n“She will need a ride, she will need a hug, and she will need you — not because the act itself is so terrible, but because sometimes the world can be.” \nNOT because the act of killing an innocent is so terrible, but how people will treat her. \nREALLY?! \n— Corinne Clark (@corinnec) February 13, 2017 \nYeah, this is pretty gross. Teen Vogue tries to 'normalize' abortion for young girls https://t.co/QZp122Mkat \n— LifeZette (@LifeZette) February 13, 2017 \nFrom Lifezette: \nWhat makes the article so offensive is not the cutesy merchandise that’s suggested, including an “angry uterus” heating pad, or the blatant support of Planned Parenthood. Instead, it is the effort to convince young women, still too young to even purchase alcohol or vote, that abortion is not a serious issue. Teen Vogue tells kids: Give friends ‘angry uterus’ heating pad to make them feel better after abortion. #prolife https://t.co/6noiDcXeDI", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T19:05:54.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
