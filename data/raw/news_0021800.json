Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mum has told of her grief 10 years after two teenage girls were killed in a horror crash by a boy racer who fled the scene of his crime. \nJade Brennand, 13, and Roxanne Trim, 17, both died instantly when Ricky Herbert crashed a modified car with no rear seatbelts. \nThe stolen Vauxhall Nova he was driving split in half during the horrific smash and Herbert tried to cover up his crime. \nFour months later, he was jailed for nine years after a court heard how he fled the scene in Plymouth, claiming he was not the driver and told friends his injuries were from a fight. \nAs the bodies of the two girls lay amid the carnage and a passing doctor desperately tried to keep them alive, 17-year-old Herbert ran off and even set about washing blood from his clothes to distance himself from his awful crime. Jade and Roxanne's lives were tragically cut short Jade's devastated mum Helen is trying to teach teens how dangerous cars can be Read More Girl, 11, dies saving 3-year-old cousin from motorway horror crash moments before lorry ploughs into wreckage \nNow Jade's mum, Helen, is backing a campaign to get teenagers to think about the consequences of reckless driving. \nAt Herbert's sentencing at Plymouth Crown Court Mr Justice Royce told Herbert that he had \"an irresistible desire\" to steal cars and drive them at dangerous speeds, adding: \"A car is a lethal weapon in your hands.\" \nHerbert's only mitigation was pleading guilty, the Plymouth Herald reported . \nHis apologies, through his barrister, were met with angry laughter from the packed public gallery. The mangled wreckage of the stolen car \nMr Justice Royce was so appalled by the evidence he was presented with, he admitted it was \"difficult to conceive of a case which could be worse\". \nHe continued: \"It is without doubt the worst case of its kind that I've had to deal with. \n\"There could be worse cases – but not many. \n\"You snuffed out two young lives and in many ways ruined your own – you have to live with that, their families have to live with that.\" \nHerbert stole the blue Vauxhall Nova from an address in Dunstan's Terrace, St Judes, earlier that night. Roxanne would have been 27 now \nThe court heard how the teen had even boasted to his own stepfather about a vehicle he intended to steal. \nThe powerful car had had its standard 1300cc engine replaced with an 1800cc version, increasing it from 69bhp to 115bhp. \nThe rear seats had also been ripped out, along with the rear seatbelts – a modification which had grave consequences later that night. \nBought just three weeks earlier by a car dealer, Herbert broke in, cracked the steering lock and hot-wired the ignition using a screwdriver.

I saw it take off. \n\"By that I mean all four wheels came off of the road. It was turning in the air.\" \nIn the opposite direction a Citroen Xantia was being driven by a 39-year-old man with his female passenger. \nThe court heard how he saw the Nova hurtle towards him, airborne, across the central reservation. \nThe shocked court heard from prosecutor David Gittins who said: \"The Nova struck the front of the Xantia with such speed and force it forced the Nova to flip over in a barrel roll.\" Jade and Roxanne's families had to bury their beloved daughters Read More \nThe Nova came to rest further down the road, one half against a fence, the other in the road 50 feet way. \nBoth Jade and Roxanne had been hurled from the spinning car, along with the passenger seat. \nA Home Office pathologist found both girls suffered multiple fractures and severe internal injuries, which he believed would have rendered them immediately unconscious. \nBy comparison Herbert suffered three bruises and four grazes to his body. \nA passing driver in a BMW went to assist and spotted a limping Herbert, whose first words were: \"I was not the driver.\" \nThe driver left Herbert in his own car as he tried to help one of the dying girls. \nA passing doctor also lent his assistance, attempting to resuscitate Roxanne. Helen still deals with the heartache of losing Jade (Photo: Northcliffe Media Ltd.) \nHe continued the battle for her life on the ambulance and into Derriford Hospital, where she was pronounced dead at 12.10am. \nDespite the efforts of motorists and paramedics, Jade was pronounced dead at 11.38pm. \nHerbert slipped away from the scene to a nearby friend's house. \nThere he told the friend's mother he had been in a fight and needed a change of clothes, urging her to immediately put his bloodied rags in the washing machine. \nBy this time police had learned the identity of the driver and one officer raced to his home where he observed a young woman leave Herbert's house. \nThe officer tailed her and when she met with Herbert he was asked why he was limping. \n\"I've fallen off my bike,\" he lied. Hundreds of wellwishers turned out to say goodbye to the teens Read More Driver dies after truck plunges off bridge and bursts into flames in Essex \nEven after he was told during his interview that both his passengers had died, he only ever responded \"no comment\". \nWhile a breath test came back negative, Mr Justice Royce queried why no drugs test was carried out after it was revealed Herbert had told his stepfather he was \"high on ecstasy and Valium\" at the time of the crash. \nAfter his client's pitiful apology was met with disdain, Herbert's advocate, Ali Rafiti, revealed that the teen had been moved from one young offenders' institution to another for his own safety. \nIn court, Herbert's previous convictions were read out – assault, dangerous driving, taking cars without consent, driving whilst disqualified and interfering with a vehicle. \nAs well as admitting causing two deaths by dangerous driving, Herbert also admitted further charges of driving while disqualified, taking a vehicle without consent and of handling stolen property. \nMr Justice Royce noted that at the time of the crash, Herbert was still serving a 24 month-long conditional discharge. Helen gives a talk about the dangers of driving to thousands of students Helen fought back tears as she told students: \"You are not bullet-proof\" \nListing 10 separate aggravating factors in the case, Mr Justice Royce noted that he had to allow a mandatory reduction to the sentence due to Herbert's guilty plea. \nHe passed an indeterminate sentence, adding: \"The parole board will consider your release after half of that period (of the nine years), but you must understand your sentence is unlimited. \n\"It could be the rest of your life. \n\"Your speed at the time was such that your vehicle split in two, your young female passengers were thrown out. \n\"You were, it appears to me, not remotely concerned about them (Jade and Roxanne). \n\"Your concern was to save your own skin. You sneaked away. \n\"The impact on the families of those two young girls has been incalculable. The court heard is was a miracle nobody in the Citroen Xantia was killed after it was struck by Herbert Read More \n\"They had everything to live for. The families' pain and their grief will never subside. \n\"They're having to live with their loss for the rest of their lives.\" \nHerbert later won an appeal against his sentence and was released on licence in 2014 - but this was later revoked and it is understood her remains in prison, due for release in 2019. \nSince the crash, Jade's mother, Helen, has gone on to support the Learn2Live campaign , which seeks to encourage youngsters to think about the dangers – and costs – of reckless driving. \nShe has been joined by Jade's younger sister, Courtney, and their stark heartbreaking videos, which recall the joy the 13-year-old brought them both and their memories of that awful night, have been seen by thousands of other youngsters. A banner says goodbye to the girls at the scene of the crash \nIn 2009, she spoke in front of 3,000 college and sixth-form students at the Learn 2 Live event at Plymouth Pavilions. \nFighting back tears, she told them: \"You are not bullet-proof.\" \nShe said she wanted to force home the message to as many people as possible in a bid to spare other parents the pain she had gone through. \nShe said: \"Something good has got to come out of Jade's death and if that's what it is then I'll do it. The court heard how the stolen Vauxhall Nova was 'ripped in two' Read More \n\"If just one person out of those 3,000 changes their ways because of it then it would make me happy. \n\"I think it made a real difference. You could hear a pin drop in the room.\" \nThe spot where Jade and Roxanne lost their lives has since become a shrine to the pair. \nEach year, their passing is marked by flowers and messages offered by their grieving family and friends. \nIf they had lived, Jade would now be 23 and Roxanne 27.
