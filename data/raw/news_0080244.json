He made the comments in his opening statement Monday evening on his show.\n“Critical mass has now been reached,” he began, “as the Trump administration is now denying access to certain news organizations it believes are out to get the president. So in an act of defiance, the president has announced he will not show up to this year’s White House Correspondence Dinner in April. He does however want everybody to have a good time.”\nIf this political controversy were a legal case, and I were the judge, I’d have to recuse myself. That’s because for the last 20 years I’ve watched the liberal media in America scorch the Fox News Channel and the media who work here, including me. The attacks are personal, relentless, and often dishonest.\nJust last week after Alan Colmes passed, a far-left smear website vilified him as a weak liberal, and a calculated pawn for the network. Does it get any worse than that? No it does not. So there’s no question that if the national media does not like your politics, it will try to hurt you, even if you are deceased. Anyone denying that is a deceiver.\n“Of course, the Trump administration is well aware of this,” he continued. “It knows that the media is desperately trying to link the Trump campaign to Russia. And will use anonymous sources to drive that narrative in the hope that the election will be perceived as invalid. “\n“By the way, we do not, do not,” he said emphatically, “use anonymous sources here. I’ve been told plenty of bad stuff about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. But without attribution, it’s not gonna be reported.”\nThe president also understands that certain news organizations despise him to the point that employees actually fear for their jobs if they say positive things about him. Many left-wing editors and executives believe Mr. Trump’s positions on illegal immigration, global warming, Muslim terrorism, abortion, crime and just about every other issue, define the president as a dangerous man who must be destroyed. Therefore anyone supporting him, cannot be tolerated.\n“There will be no detente,” O’Reilly warned. “The gulf is too wide. It’ll be one nasty media confrontation after another until the president leaves office. Now, it’s difficult to see how this awful situation benefits anyone. The country is not helped by all the acrimony. “\nO’Reilly then gave the president some advice on how to tackle the media and defend himself.\nTalking Points believes the president has a right to defend himself, but should do so using facts. If a report is wrong, fake news, have Sean Spicer vividly refute it in detail. If access is denied to certain press organizations, specifically spell out why. If you don’t, you come off as petulant.\nFacts will always win the debate, always, as we prove on this program every night.\nO’Reilly goes on to explain why it was a good thing for Trump to reject the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, saying it would have been “bizarre” otherwise.\nThe cold fact is,” he continued, “that the 2016 presidential election defined the free press in America. It’s actively, actively left wing, not objective. But now things have become so much worse than ideology.”\n“Now, it’s war,” he concluded.\n\nThe war between the media and Trump has escalated since CNN reported on a dossier about damaging information the Russians had allegedly uncovered about Trump, eventually ending in the president declaring the media the “enemy of the American people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:15:37.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
