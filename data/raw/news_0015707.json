Staggering numbers revealed at royal commission \nGail Furness SC used her opening address yesterday to reveal 4,444 allegations of incidents of abuse between January 1980 and February 2015 were made to Catholic Church authorities. \nBetween 1950 and 2010, she said there were 1,880 alleged perpetrators from within the Catholic Church. \nThis is the 50th public hearing of the four-year-long royal commission and it is the 16th dealing with abuse in the Catholic Church. \nThe royal commission has investigated how institutions across the country, including schools, churches, sports clubs and government organisations, have responded to allegations and instances of abuse.
