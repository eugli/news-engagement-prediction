We're looking at you, super-duper cute bulldogs. Image: Giphy \nWe love, love, love ourselves some puppies â€” even when they are stinky. But is it too much to ask that they don't? No, no it's not. There are actually certain dog breeds that don't stink. \nIf you're searching for a dog breed whose funk isn't strong enough to clear a room, these guys are your best bet. 1. Poodle Image: littledoglinus \nThe experts at PetPlace.com recommend poodles for people who prefer dogs that naturally have low odor. These fluffy pups come in three sizes, from toy poodles that are ideal for apartment dwellers to the standard poodles that love larger accommodations, and have a hypoallergenic coat that may reduce allergic reactions. 2. Bichon frise Image: sandygram78 \nAnother dog that tends to be a good breed for allergy sufferers, the bichon is a low- to no-odor dog that doesn't shed much but requires regular brushing. These playful pups also have a load of energy and love physical activity. 3. Collies Image: amandaaa08 \nLassie had more going for her than being a loyal life-saver. She was also a collie, a clean breed pleasantly noted for not having a doggy odor. Keep in mind, though, that collies do shed and need regular brushing. \nOriginally published September 2013.
