political as he accepted the Best Actor award at Saturday's 32nd annual Film Independent Spirit Awards, coming from California 's Santa Monica Pier.\n'The policies of this administration are abhorrent and they will not last ... they're really un-American,' he said in reference to President Donald Trump . He added that while he didn't want to come off as 'preachy and boring,' he wanted to impart the message to his children, who pay the closest attention to him when he's on TV.\nThe younger brother of Ben Affleck said that he's spent more than '20 years in independent moves' and 'mostly only worked in independent movies,' adding, 'I'm happier here with you guys!'\nThe actor earlier took ribbing from hosts John Mulaney and Nick Kroll, who joked how, in Manchester by the Sea, he plays 'a man who is living in the shadow of his older brother,' adding, 'What a reach!'\nExcalibur moment: Manchester by the Sea's Casey Affleck accepted the Best Actor award at Saturday's 32nd annual Film Independent Spirit Awards, coming from California's Santa Monica Pier\n'Abhorrent': Trump - roundly ostracized by the show business community as evidenced by his inability to recruit big names to perform at his inauguration - was panned by Casey Affleck (right) during Saturday's awards. It's likely the critique was only a taste of what's coming up at Sunday's Oscars\nDefining moment: Casey looked overjoyed as he was honored by the Independent Film community, saying, 'I'm happier here with you guys!'\nHis two cents: Affleck ripped President Donald Trump as he said: 'The policies of this administration are abhorrent and they will not last ... they're really un-American,'\nFashion statement: Casey wore a shirt baring the Arabic symbol of Love on the chest, garnering props on social media for his awareness\nClear room for more: Casey remains neck and neck with Fences star Denzel Washington for Sunday's Oscar awards\nKroll and Mulaney got in plenty of jabs on the commander-in-chief in the rousing opening monologue they opened the show with. Mulaney joked, 'Hey Trump, you and Robert Durst are both rich sociopaths from New York, but somehow Robert Durst is more likable!'\nKroll, speaking on the politics of the show biz movers and shakers attending the beach event, said, 'If this room leaned anymore to the left, we would literally topple into the Pacific Ocean!'\nMaking a statement: Sasha Lane posed with a Black Lives Matter shirt\nFunnies: John Mulaney and Nick Kroll kicked off the show with a rousing monologue touching on a number of contemporary issues\nWhipping boy: Mulaney mocked the commander-in-chiefs's bombastic Twitter tendencies, as he said: 'These films are, to Quote: the president, \"Sad!\"'\nDouble trouble: Mulaney and Kroll joked about celebs ranging from Trump to Mel Gibson to Affleck in their monologue\nPerfect day: Moonlight's Barry Jenkins was a huge winner at the event, capturing the prizes for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay, among the film's many plaudits\nOpus: Jenkins' celebrated movie won six awards on the day, also garnering honors for cinematography, editing and the Robert Altman Award\nElsewhere, Moonlight was the big winner at the event - going a perfect six-for-six in nominations and wins - as it took home honors for Best Picture, Best Director for Jenkins, Best Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography and the Robert Altman Award.\nMolly Shannon gave a rousing speech in accepting the Best Supporting Female award for Other People.\nShannon thanked a number of her associates in a rousing speech, in which she delved into some of the issues Other People dealt with.\n'Cancer has become a part of so many people's lives ... I think these stories could be some of the most necessary stories to tell,' said Shannon, who dedicated the awards to mothers worldwide.\nMolly Shannon won the Best Supporting Female award for Other People at Saturday's 32nd annual Film Independent Spirit Awards, coming from California's Santa Monica Pier\nCrowning moment: In a reference to her Saturday Night Live persona Mary Katherine Gallagher, Shannon joked, 'I really truly in this moment feel like a Superstar!'\nThe one-time Saturday Night Live star rehashed one of her famous lines from the NBC show, as she said, 'I really truly in this moment feel like a Superstar!'\nIsabelle Huppert won Best Female Lead for Elle, and Ben Foster captured the Best Supporting Male actor award for Hell or High Water earlier in the evening.\nHistorically, the last three best-feature winners at the Film Independent Spirit Awards have gone on to win Best Picture the next day at the Academy Awards, but that streak appears likely to snap this year.\nThe Oscar favorite La La Land, a smidge too pricey with a $30 million budget to qualify for the indie awards, wasn't in the hunt at Saturday's awards.\nWinner: Ben Foster captured the Best Supporting Male actor award for Hell or High Water at Saturday's Film Independent Spirit Awards, coming from Santa Monica, California.\nHardware: Foster played Tanner Howard in the David Mackenzie-directed drama\nThe Spirit Awards, held under a tent on the beach in Santa Monica, California, are the dressed-down, afternoon antidote to the Academy Awards, where cocktails and indie pride are consumed in equal measure.\nThe Spirit Awards have often been a kind of a seaside dress rehearsal for the Oscars. Before Spotlight, Birdman and 12 Years a Slave triumphed at the Academy Awards, they also won at the Spirits the day before.\nSome still believe Moonlight or Kenneth Lonergan's Manchester by the Sea (up for five Spirits, including best feature and best actor for Casey Affleck) have an underdog's chance of upsetting the La La Land juggernaut. But that film's hefty Oscar haul - a record-tying 14 nods - has given the sense of an impending sweep.\nShining star: Taraji P. Henson was a presenter for the Best Supporting Male actor award\nHigh profile: Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Janelle Monáe shared a laugh as presenters\nNominations are chosen by members of Film Independent, which includes critics, filmmakers, actors, festival programmers, past winners and nominees, and members of its board of directors.\nAccolades: Tarell Alvin McCraney was snapped as he delivered a speech after winning the Best Screenplay for Moonlight with Barry Jenkins\nHappy days: (Left to right) Spa Night's Kelly Thomas, Giulia Caruso, Andrew Ahn, and David Ariniello collected the John Cassavetes award for their motion picture\nBusy day: The Witch's Robert Eggers won both Best First Feature and Best First Screenplay\nHappy Hollywood couple: Luciana Barroso and Matt Damon were casual cool at the event\nShipping up to Boston: Damon was seen chatting with pal Casey Affleck on a night the latter was up for Best Actor honors\nStar power: The seaside award show drew a number of big stars to the beach, including A-lister Orlando Bloom\n2017 Independent Spirit Awards Winners Best Feature:\nAmerican Honey\nChronic\nJackie\nManchester by the Sea\nMoonlight - WINNER\nBest Director:\nAndrea Arnold, American Honey\nBarry Jenkins, Moonlight - WINNER\nPablo Larraín, Jackie\nJeff Nichols, Loving\nKelly Reichardt, Certain Women\nBest First Feature:\nThe Childhood of a Leader\nThe Fits\nOther People\nSwiss Army Man\nThe Witch - WINNER\nBest Female Lead:\nAnnette Bening, 20th Century Women\nIsabelle Huppert, Elle - WINNER\nSasha Lane, American Honey\nRuth Negga, Loving\nNatalie Portman, Jackie\nBest Male Lead:\nCasey Affleck, Manchester by the Sea - WINNER\nDavid Harewood, Free In Deed\nViggo Mortensen, Captain Fantastic\nJesse Plemons, Other People\nTim Roth, Chronic\nBest Supporting Female:\nEdwina Findley, Free In Deed\nPaulina García, Little Men\nLily Gladstone, Certain Women\nRiley Keough, American Honey\nMolly Shannon, Other People - WINNER\nBest Supporting Male:\nRalph Fiennes, A Bigger Splash\nBen Foster, Hell or High Water - WINNER\nLucas Hedges, Manchester by the Sea\nShia LaBeouf, American Honey\nCraig Robinson, Morris from America\nBest Screenplay:\nBarry Jenkins, Moonlight (story by Tarell Alvin McCraney) - WINNER\nKenneth Lonergan, Manchester by the Sea\nMike Mills, 20th Century Women\nIra Sachs & Mauricio Zacharias, Little Men\nTaylor Sheridan, Hell or High Water\nBest First Screenplay:\nRobert Eggers, The Witch - WINNER\nChris Kelly, Other People\nAdam Mansbach, Barry\nStella Meghie, Jean of the Joneses\nCraig Shilowich, Christine\nBest Cinematography:\nAva Berkofsky, Free In Deed\nLol Crawley, The Childhood of a Leader\nZach Kuperstein, The Eyes of My Mother\nJames Laxton, Moonlight - WINNER\nRobbie Ryan, American Honey\nBest Editing:\nMatthew Hannam, Swiss Army Man\nJennifer Lame, Manchester by the Sea\nJoi McMillon and Nat Sanders, Moonlight - WINNER\nJake Roberts, Hell or High Water\nSebastián Sepúlveda, Jackie\nJohn Cassavetes Award:\nFree In Deed\nHunter Gatherer\nLovesong\nNakom\nSpa Night - WINNER\nRobert Altman Award:\nAmerican Honey\nMoonlight - WINNER\nMorris from America\nBest Documentary:\n13th\nCameraperson\nI Am Not Your Negro\nO.J.: Made in America - WINNER\nSonita\nUnder the Sun\nBest International Film:\nAquarius (Brazil)\nChevalier (Greece)\nMy Golden Days (France)\nToni Erdmann (Germany and Romania) - WINNER\nUnder the Shadow (Iran and U.K.)\nPiaget Producers Award:\nLisa Kjerulff\nJordana Mollick - WINNER\nMelody C.
