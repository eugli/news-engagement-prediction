Together, these have allowed us to fund new priorities without cutting back in essential areas.” \nBut in coming years, expenditure needs are expected to rise rapidly, particularly in healthcare and infrastructure, said Mr Heng. \nHe explained that annual healthcare spending has more than doubled to around S$10 billion in FY2016 with enhanced subsidies and expanded services, but will continue to rise as Singapore’s population ages. The projected doubling of the MRT network is also expected to cost more than S$20 billion over the next five years, along with the new Terminal 5 at Changi Airport which will cost “tens of billions of dollars”, said Mr Heng. \n“With our spending needs increasing, the Government must continue to spend judiciously, emphasise value-for-money and drive innovation in delivery,” said Mr Heng. “We can do better – and more – with less.” \nPRO-GROWTH, PROGRESSIVE REVENUE BASE \nNoting the need to strengthen Singapore’s revenue base in a “pro-growth and progressive manner”, Mr Heng said: \"Like all Finance Ministers before me, it is my duty to take the long view. Our domestic needs will grow over time, and the global environment will shift. We must study the implications and prepare our options early.\" \nFor instance, in support of the worldwide Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, which seeks to ensure companies are taxed where substantive economic activities are performed, Singapore will refine its schemes and implement the relevant standards. \nSingapore is also studying how to adjust its GST system, said Mr Heng, to ensure a level playing field between local businesses which are GST-registered and foreign-based ones which are not. This comes against a backdrop of increasing digital transactions and cross-border trade. \nDomestically, the Government will have to raise revenues through new taxes or raise tax rates, to ensure future generations can remain on sustainable fiscal footing, said Mr Heng. \nBut there will be tax measures to help businesses – for instance, some existing tax incentive schemes will be extended and strengthened to enhance competitiveness in financial and global trading sectors, he added. - CNA/jo ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T11:59:52.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
