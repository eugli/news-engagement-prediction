Wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha had to wait for almost two years to play each of his second and third Tests. ( Kohli on Test series against Australia: Not bothered about the opposition ) \nSaha had long led the life of a reserve wicketkeeper (both in domestic and national teams) despite being the best in the business and is a perfect example of why being the best was not always good enough.

He became the 15th Bengal player to score a hundred on Ranji debut. But while things were falling in place for Saha in the domestic circuit, a national reckoning was far-fetched. ( Aussies just don't have the arsenal to walk the 'sledging' talk ) \nThe big day, however, came in 2010. A last-minute injury to Rohit Sharma handed Saha a Test debut against South Africa in Nagpur. It took him another two years to play his next match in whites. And that too was fortuitously - a result of captain and regular wicketkeeper Dhoni's suspension for slow over rate against Australia in Adelaide, 2012.

BCCI Photo \nExcerpts : \nQuestion : Your journey in Indian cricket has always seen long waiting periods, be it the domestic or the national teams. What did you do waiting for all those years to suddenly making an impact after MS Dhoni left? \nWriddhiman Saha : I was always focused on my game. Since my childhood, I have always looked to keep myself prepared for the match at any point of time so that whenever I got a chance to play, I should be able to perform. Whether I had the chance to play or not, I always kept myself prepared. I have always been mentally strong. ( Virat Kohli not Australia's only threat: 4 other concerns for Steve Smith's men ) \nQ :How would you describe Kohli's impact on your performance and on the team, overall? \nSaha : Virat Kohli always stays positive. Whenever he talks to the players, he always creates a positive environment in the team. Obviously, it is a challenge to play in the team because it is a matter of winning or losing. Personally, I love this challenge and I like the way how Kohli remains positive under any circumstances. Winning or losing is a part and parcel of the game but if you stay positive, you have maximum chances of winning. ( Steve Smith's men weakest Australian side to tour India, says Harbhajan Singh ) \nQ : What makes Kohli's team so special where players thrive under any circumstances? \nSaha : Right now our team environment is very positive and that's our plus point. We always back each other despite the performances. One can endure a bad day on the field but we always support and motivate each other. When someone performs well, we all take pride in that and when someone has a bad day, we try to back him to perform better. This is the kind of team environment we have at the moment. This is basically due to the fact that all the players are in similar stages of their careers. Overall, this environment is a big bonus for all of us. The coach and team management are also very supportive and they always tell us to play according to our style. ( Australia just don't have the arsenal to walk the 'sledging' talk ) \nQ : You are regarded as the best wicketkeeper in the country. However, keeping wickets to Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in Indian conditions is not an easy task. What kind of challenges do you face? \nSaha : It feels great to keep wickets to two of the top spinners of the world (Ashwin and Jadeja). You have to stay alert and you can never lose your focus. There's never a place for relaxation on the field. You have to be always ready. It is a challenge that I enjoy. I never premeditate while keeping. I always take it ball by ball and enjoy my work as I feel that if I enjoy it, it will help me perform better. \nQ : How do you asses India's use of the Decision Review System? Take us through the on-field actions when Kohli decides to review the original decision. \nSaha : We have been told to give our views whenever the captain decides to go for the Decision Review System. There's no pressure on us. We have been told to give our direct views on it. We can be right or wrong, but that's not a factor.
