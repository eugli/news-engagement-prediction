JULIAN LEE Last updated 20:30, February 1 2017 DAVID WALKER/Fairfax NZ \nThe Wellington Sevens are in the doldrums. Could Christchurch pick up the event? \nThe World Sevens circuit: Paris, London, Hong Kong, Las Vegas… Christchurch? \nThe Wellington Sevens crowds are pitiful and New Zealand Rugby is considering whether to move the tournament elsewhere in New Zealand. \nAs wild as the idea may seem, there is only one serious problem preventing the event from shifting to the Garden City – a lack of player facilities. GETTY IMAGES \nFans watch the 2017 Wellington Sevens at Westpac Stadium on January 28. The stands at the event were once full of fans. \nNew Zealand Rugby (NZR) met with Christchurch City Council and Canterbury Rugby Union officials in 2016 to discuss the move. \nNZR general manager of relationships, planning and operations Nigel Cass said the talk was part of a regular review of other potential tournament locations. \n\"We last spoke to Christchurch and discussed what needed to be delivered. Christchurch parties said they wouldn't be able to meet the specifications. FAIRFAX NZ \nWith dwindling crowds a worrying for the Wellington Sevens tournament, is it time for Christchurch to take over hosting the event? \n\"You've got to be able to host 16 teams for week and have a venue with the capacity. You need facilities for match officials and so on, availability of space so that teams can warm up and a whole range of other things.\" \nSurprisingly, it was not the city's accommodation capacity that held back the event. Nor was it transport, or infrastructure, or even stadium size. \nEven though AMI Stadium can only seat 18,000, Paris's Stade Jean-Bouin, which is used for the French leg of the series, can seat only 20,000. \nCouncil head of events Richard Attwood said AMI simply did not have enough changing sheds – Wellington's Westpac Stadium has eight sets of rooms, while AMI has only two. Ad Feedback \n\"It's all very well holding an All Blacks test with two sets of changing rooms, but you'd need enough for all those teams in the [sevens] event.\" \nAttwood said the players also needed somewhere to warm up and there was nowhere suitable. The teams would not be able to use Addington Racecourse as it was too far from the stadium. \nA lack of enthusiasm in the city was also a contributing factor, he said. \n\"It's a very complex event, it's not just about council putting funds into it, it's about city businesses getting behind the event. It goes all the way down to the guys who do the printing, the cars that get hired and so on.\" \nChristchurch councillor Aaron Keown said the city could host the event if it wanted to. \n\"It's whether we allow people to party and drink and have fun. If we don't have a good atmosphere, one without all the ingredients for a party, and we stop people from drinking it won't work.\" \nHe said the logistical problems were easily solved. \n\"If they (changing rooms) don't have to be over the fence, there are other parks within 1 kilometre of that stadium. Can we get a shuttle going? Or we give them shared bikes that they ride to the stadium. Riding a bike is a really good warm-up.\" \nThe tournament could inject some serious cash into the city – at the Wellington Sevens's peak the event generated $15 million. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T09:37:21.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
