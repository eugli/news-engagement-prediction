In anticipation of the winter storm, Portland International Jetport in Portland, Maine, canceled all flights for 24 hours, from Sunday at 8 p.m. to Monday at 8 p.m. As a coastal front intensifies, freezing temperatures, cooler air and more snow are expected for Connecticut up through Maine until Tuesday evening, meteorologists said. In Maine, 345,000 people remain under a blizzard warning through Tuesday morning, the agency warns. Overnight, the colder air will move in dropping temps below freezing.

West Coast gets drenched The West Coast continues to grapple with rapid snow melt and heavy rains in the Sierra mountains, which led to flooding in parts of Nevada and Southern California last week. In Northern California, recent rainfall totals have reached record highs in the Bay Area. The National Weather Service has called this the wettest winter season there in more than 100 years.

To help disperse the water build-up in the area, officials opened the Oroville Dam's the emergency spillway for the first time Sunday. The Oroville Dam is the tallest dam in the United States. Alarm bells went off after authorities found a hole in the dam's spillway. Nearly 200,000 residents living downstream from the dam were forced to evacuate their homes Sunday. Hazardous situation is developing with the #OrovilleDam Dam auxiliary spillway.
