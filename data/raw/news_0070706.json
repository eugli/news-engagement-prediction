It’s not just for dinner. Feature film The Lobster is up for an Academy Award this coming Sunday\nThe Best Original Screenplay contender, written by Yorgos Lanthimos and Efthimis Filippou, is an English-language black comedy about a society where pairing up is compulsory. Singles have 45 days to find a new partner or they’re turned into the animal of their choice.\nColin Farrell plays a divorcee who opts to become a lobster because, he says, “lobsters live for over 100 years, are blue-blooded like aristocrats and stay fertile all their lives. I also like the sea, very much.”\n(His friend thinks it’s pathetic. “They’ll catch you and put you in a pot of boiling water until you die,” he predicts.)\n While Star movie critic Peter Howell doesn’t see the appeal of The Lobster — “meh on movie, yuk on crustacean,” he said in an email — I do, most specifically when it comes to eating.\nLBS on Yonge St., pronounced “pounds,” is a restaurant that used to focus on lobster, burgers and salads. It switched to a seafood format three months ago.\nLobster salad does the trick at LBS on Yonge St. ( Andrew Francis Wallace ) The lobster salad ($29) is triumph of texture and flavour.\nFirst there is the crunch of shaved celery, heirloom carrots and peppery radishes. Cooling cucumber ribbons wind their way through the bowl, both floppy and firm. The tail and claw meat from a 1.25-pound lobster is in there, properly steamed and cleaned. Even the contrasting lettuces — bitter frisée with sweet baby romaine — play their parts well.\nTarragon, like black comedy, must be subtle. So it is in the buttermilk dressing, “a no-brainer” combination with lobster, according to executive chef Kate Venables-Lloyd. Finally, toasted pumpkin seeds add earthiness.\nThere’s nothing absurd about this meal. As for the movie, Venables-Lloyd says she can see the appeal of Farrell’s character’s choice.\n“Lobsters live at the bottom of the ocean, which must be an interesting place to be. And they mate for life,” she says.\nHer own choice would be a cat.\n“They have a fantastic life, sleeping, purring and chasing birds.”\nLBS restaurant, 100 Yonge St. (at Adelaide St.), 647-351-4747, lbstoronto.com.
