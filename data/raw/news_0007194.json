On “Thorns,” the lead single from their third full-length album, Heartless , they trade in gloom for heavy, memorable hooks. Creeping, downtuned chords—a constant of the band—pair with guitar work that’s more meticulous and flashy than before. Delicate leads shimmer and spark; ornate guitars unfurl majestically, like a medieval tapestry. Their music retains that same crushing weight, but on “Thorns,” they’ve dipped their harrowing harmonies in gold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:45:48.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
