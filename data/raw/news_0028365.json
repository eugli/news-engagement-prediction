A walk behind the scenes at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show can be overwhelming. But a close look reveals what makes each breed unique. Above, Pippa, an English setter.   Photo Glitter is a 3-year-old horse-coat Chinese shar-pei owned by Deborah Camp of East Haddam, Conn. Glitter’s official name is Grand Champion Camp Wrinkles Stairway to Heaven. Chinese shar-pei, known for their wrinkly skin, are said to date from the Han dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.) in China.   Photo The foot of Kickstart, a bulldog. The nonsporting group was won by a bulldog in last year’s show.   Photo Duo, an Australian shepherd. The eyes of the Australian shepherd vary in color, a notable characteristic of the breed.   Photo The tail of Whizz, a 6-year-old Finnish spitz. Part of the nonsporting group, the breed has long been used to hunt small game and birds and is known for its bushy tail.   Photo Preston, a 5-year-old puli, has won 95 best-in-show titles, according to The Associated Press. The herding breed is known for its long, cordlike coat.   Photo Sancho is a Xoloitzcuintli, a Mexican hairless breed revered by the Mayans and known for its consonant-heavy name.   Photo Pilot, a chow chow, won best in breed. The chow chow’s blue-black tongue is perhaps its most distinctive feature.   Photo Finn, an Afghan hound. The breed’s long, flowing coat served as protection in the harsh, mountainous climate where it originated.   Photo Miranda Dowler, of Vancouver, Wash., wore a sequined outfit she designed with her friend Kate Miles to show Shelby, a Siberian husky. “People spend all year looking for their Westminster suit,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:53:40.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
