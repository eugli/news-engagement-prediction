Who would arrange Wednesday night dinners with Dad? What would we do with him gone? As we entered adulthood and moved to different parts of the country, we didn’t need one another as much, but we realized something: We wanted to spend time together. We took a trip without our parents, rafting in southern Oregon. We mused about how nice it would be if we lived in the same city. When I was going through a rough time in my mid-20s, it was my kid brother, newly graduated from college, who came and slept on the floor of my tiny apartment, not because I had asked him to but because he sensed that I didn’t want to be alone. Now we’re squarely in middle age, with families of our own. Our parents moved on from the bitterness; they both remarried, happily, years ago. For us, though, the time of their divorce remains a potent point of reference, a shared experience that offers a wellspring of barbed humor. We three now live thousands of miles from where we grew up but within a few miles of one another, just as we talked about when we were younger. We’ve rented summer houses together; for a time, Eric and I worked at the same magazine — our offices shared a wall. Team Umansky, my husband calls us. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story That closeness gives me a solace I wish I hadn’t had such a need for recently. Five years ago, at age 69, our mother learned she had a rare, aggressive cancer, and in that brutal, overwhelming period, we three relied on one another, taking turns visiting, sharing what little information we had. Last January, she passed away, and since then, the three of us said Kaddish, the Jewish prayer that one traditionally recites for 11 months after the death of a parent. Often we went to services together. Afterward we would gossip and get pricey coffee, and avoid our responsibilities, joking about how our mother would approve. Of course she would. When you recite Kaddish as a mourner, you stand while everyone else in the congregation remains seated. In the months after she died, as I rose to say the short prayer, the holidays she loved passed, and my birthday and hers too, and still she was gone. I would glance out the synagogue window at the tree branches — bare when she died last winter, then full and resplendent for months, and now skeletal again. This passage of time feels at once inconceivable and heartbreakingly normal. I miss my mother beyond measure, and during Kaddish I became lost in my thoughts, in my own private mourning. But I stood with my brothers. I heard their voices chanting too. One time, I walked into services, and a woman who is a regular whispered to me, “Your brothers aren’t here yet.” And my heart swelled a little at the idea that even people who barely know me see me as part of this unit. A few months ago, I was at a child’s party, and a mother there was lamenting how her young daughters didn’t get along. “It’s a parenting fail,” she said. I thought of telling the same divorce joke my brother had made, but I didn’t. I wish I had said what I truly believed, that these things can’t be forced. The best you can do is step back and let alchemy take over. A couple of years after the divorce, David and I were in our backyard, where he and a friend were fixing up a tiny, one-man sailboat they’d bought, painting it red. Our kitchen faced the backyard, with a big window over the sink, and when David went in to wash his hands, I had a decent view of him. \nAdvertisement He turned on the sink disposal; I heard the grinding noise, and then — I’ll never forget it — he began screaming, holding up his red, dripping hands. I shrieked. His hands, caught, mangled! The terror: It still manages to turn my skin cold. Then he pulled open the screen door with disarming ease and bounded outside, laughing. “It’s a joke; it’s just the paint,” he said, coming over. “See? I’m fine, I’m completely fine.” “I hate you,” I said, crying, turning away from him, my heart knotted up in equal parts fear and fury. “I really, really hate you.” I have two daughters of my own now, three years apart, as my brothers and I are. My daughters are nothing alike. They rarely play together. They are not each other’s best friends. But in moments of true despair, I have seen them reach for each other. And for that, I’m grateful. The rest we will just have to see. \nEllen Umansky, who lives in Brooklyn, is the author of the novel “The Fortunate Ones,” to be published this month. \nTo contact Modern Love, email modernlove@nytimes.com. \nTo hear Modern Love: The Podcast, subscribe on iTunes or Google Play Music . \nTo read past Modern Love columns, click here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T12:17:56.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
