Funded research remains one of the food industry’s most powerful marketing tactics. When a doctor or medical journal publicizes nutritional information, it does not feel like advertising. Privately funded research has the unique skill of turning marketing into facts. \nAn analysis of beverage studies published in the journal PLOS Medicine in 2013 found that studies funded by Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, the American Beverage Association and the sugar industry were five times more likely to find no link between sugary drinks and weight gain than studies whose authors reported no financial conflicts. According to a paper published last year in the journal Research Integrity and Peer Review , conflicts of interest remain underreported, inconsistently described and difficult to access. \nThe American Society for Nutrition and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics have each been criticized by public health advocates for forming partnerships with Kraft Foods, McDonald’s, PepsiCo and Hershey’s. \nMeanwhile, dieticians have been found taking payments from Coca-Cola to plug the company’s soda as a healthy snack. In 2015, the New York Times obtained emails that revealed Coca-Cola had funded research that shifted the blame for obesity from bad diets to exercise. The beverage company provided financial support to scientists who spread the message that exercise is more important than sugar consumption for weight management in medical journals, at conferences and through social media. As author Gary Taubes notes in the New York Times , Coca-Cola’s funded claims are false. \nDisclosure is important, but it’s not a complete solution to a nutritional community that has failed us \nScientists have recognized sugar as a particularly harmful calorie – due to its unique composition of glucose and fructose, which encourages fat storage in the body – since the 1960s. Nevertheless, Coke persisted. \nMore recently, the Associated Press obtained emails showing how a trade association representing the makers of Butterfinger, Hershey’s and Skittles funded studies showing that children who eat candy tend to have a healthier body weight than those who do not. \nIn a section about the study’s limitations, the paper’s authors conceded that the data “may not reflect usual intake” and “cause and effect associations cannot be drawn.” The candy association’s press release did not mention these limitations as it declared: “New study shows children and adolescents who eat candy are less overweight or obese.” \nThis lack of transparency has been going on for decades. In 1967, the sugar industry paid three Harvard scientists the equivalent of about US$50,000 in today’s dollars to conduct research that proved sugar did not cause heart disease, according to an article published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine last year. The research, published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, concluded there were major problems with other studies that found sugar to be harmful to human health – and it did not disclose the sugar industry’s funding. \nAt best, these industry-funded studies contribute to a murky sea of nutritional advice. In the never-ending quest to eat healthy, you may have at one point wondered if all calories are, in fact, created equal. How important is exercise in weight management? And are foods that advertise a healthy logo like the Heart and Stroke Health Check actually better than those that do not? \nFor these questions, we have the food industry to thank. \n“There is a lot of confusion about nutrition today, and industry-funded research has definitely contributed to it,” says Cristin Kearns, co-author of the article in JAMA Internal Medicine exposing the payoff of the Harvard scientists by the sugar industry. \nHowever, due to increasing competition for research grants, proponents argue that industry-funded studies are critical for advancing nutritional science. \n“The struggle for grant money is very real,” says Dr. Freedhoff. “If the only person who’s gonna fund you is the food industry because you didn’t get your grant this year – it’s pretty hard to tell someone not to take that money, because their livelihood and career are in question. It’s not about being principled. It’s about doing your job and wanting to do good research.” Related The Canada Food Guide is killing you: ‘The obesity epidemic… really began with our dietary guidelines’ \nBut after the research is finished and the press releases have been sent, it’s the public that’s left to deal with the fallout from skewed nutritional science. Today, we continue to deal with the aftermath of the “calorie is a calorie” argument in the form of rising sugar consumption and exponentially growing rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease – conditions that many experts attribute to sugar consumption. \nAs long as health authorities persist in taking money from and forming relationships with big food businesses – which they undoubtedly will – we should be wary of the information they choose to serve. Dieticians should not promote Coca-Cola as a sensible snack. Sugar should not be pardoned for the obesity crisis. Health logos should not be available to the highest bidder. \nDisclosure is important, but it’s not a complete solution to a nutritional community that has failed us. It’s also important that we recognize the downfalls of our medical authorities. Eating healthy should not be complicated, but it will be for as long as medicine stays in the pockets of Big Food.
