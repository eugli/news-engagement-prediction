Top bloke and a brilliant father. I know a lot of us are in shock and rightfully so. \n“And for everyone paying tributes, I’m sure it’ll be a huge comfort to his family to know he’ll be missed by so many people. Sleep tight big guy.” \nAnother said of the keep-fit fanatic, who ran a building firm: “Gutted to hear about Daryl Bhandal. \n“My thoughts are with his family and friends. RIP mate.” \nGraphic designer Brad Mulock added: “Daryl Bhandal. Unbelievable. Totally and utterly unbelievable. RIP mate.” \nAnother Facebook post, written before the tragedy, revealed how Mr Bhandal had gone out with his young son and daughter on Boxing Day to hand out warm clothes to the homeless, with his company footing the bill.
