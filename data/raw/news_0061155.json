Armstrong’s legal team had asked to postpone trial until 2018 because of a potential scheduling conflict. \nThe government wants Armstrong to pay back the $32 million the U.S. Postal Service paid his team for sponsorship, plus triple damages. \nArmstrong’s former teammate Floyd Landis initially filed the whistle-blower case in 2010, accusing him of violating the sponsorship contract by taking performance-enhancing drugs. The government joined the case in 2013 after Armstrong admitted cheating and was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles. \nLandis, who was stripped of the 2006 Tour de France title for cheating, could collect up to 25 percent of damages awarded. \n(© Copyright 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
