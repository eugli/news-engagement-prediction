President Trump has said he wants to renegotiate Nafta to obtain a better deal for the United States, calling the accord the “single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.” He has threatened to pull the United States out of Nafta, which includes Mexico and Canada, if he cannot negotiate more favorable terms. Tensions have been escalating between the United States and Mexico since Mr. Trump’s election, and last week, President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico canceled a trip to Washington after Mr. Trump again insisted on Twitter that Mexico pay for a border wall. But Mexico has pressed to establish a dialogue with the new administration in Washington. On Wednesday, the Mexican government denied an Associated Press report that quoted Mr. Trump, in an excerpt from a phone call last Friday, as warning Mr. Peña Nieto that he would send American troops to Mexico to stop “bad hombres down there” unless Mexico’s security forces did something about them. In a statement, the government said that the report did not “correspond to reality.” “The negative expressions that are referred to did not occur during that call,” the statement said. “On the contrary, the tone was constructive.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The Associated Press report could not be independently confirmed. Under the United States’ Trade Promotion Authority laws, the White House must inform Congress at least 90 days before any new trade agreement is signed. While it was not immediately clear whether the Trump administration gave notice to Congress on Wednesday, the Mexican government plans to go through a similar process, according to a statement from Mexico’s foreign and economy ministries. Negotiations are expected to begin in May. The possibility of any talks at all seemed remote last Thursday when Mr. Peña Nieto canceled his trip. He has said repeatedly that Mexico will not pay for the wall, which Mr. Trump made the centerpiece of his presidential campaign, despite a projected cost of billions of dollars and questions raised by his secretary of homeland security, John F. Kelly, over how effective it would be. The phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Peña Nieto was presented as having improved relations somewhat, though there was no agreement on the wall or on whether Mr. Peña Nieto’s trip would be rescheduled.
