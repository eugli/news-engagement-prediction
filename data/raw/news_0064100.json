The Fermi Paradox is called a paradox precisely because it’s tough to reconcile the optimism of the Drake Equation with the deafening silence from everywhere in the universe. For all we know, there could be life on the seven Earth-like exoplanets within a single solar system NASA announced yesterday, although they’re a little close to their parent star TRAPPIST-1 for that.\nOne thing is for sure, though: Before we can ever hope to answer the Big Question of where all the aliens are, we’re going to have to do a lot of learning. In particular, it’ll be a while before we’re done refining our assumptions on what constitutes a sign of life in the first place. NASA ‘s Dawn spacecraft just found organic chemicals on Ceres, and the UCLA reports that they’ve found “the building blocks of life” in the atmosphere of a white dwarf star.\nThere are six chemical elements common to all known life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. CHNOPS. (Rhymes with schnapps.) All our life here on Earth is carbon-based, but it’s not crazy to imagine extraterrestrial life based on some other element — silicon is perhaps the most plausible. Carbon occupies a sweet spot in terms of chemistry; its exactly half-filled outer valence shell means that it can form bonds with a huge variety of other things.\nSilicon lives in that same sweet spot, and it may have played a pivotal role in the rise of carbon-based life on our own world. But silicon is such a heavy atom that thermodynamics seems to look sternly upon the idea of silicon-based life. So scientists have decided that they can narrow down the list of “elements necessary for life” to CHNOP, or even sometimes just CHNO. When we look through a telescope at other worlds, places that have CHNOPS in their atmosphere get put on the shortlist to check for signs of life.\n\nNASA’s Dawn orbiter has been sampling the atmosphere around Ceres , looking to characterize its atmospheric chemistry. In addition to water ice, clays, salts and sodium carbonate, scientists from Brown University working with NASA report that there are organic chemicals on Ceres : still more compounds associated with carbon-based life . While this doesn’t mean that Dawn has, or ever has had, life as we know it, it does portray Dawn as a place with a “complex chemical environment, suggesting favorable environments to prebiotic chemistry.”\nThe UCLA report is even more fun: that team found “ the basic building blocks for life ” in a star, and they got there because the star ingested one of its planets. Their report describes a white dwarf star in the Boötes constellation, with a striking chemical fingerprint. They talk about similar white dwarf stars that have become polluted with accreted debris from their environments, and then explain that the CHNO composition of this particular star means that it probably ingested an icy planetesimal formed “beyond [the star’s] nitrogen ice line in a location analogous to our Kuiper Belt.” The planetesimal would have been rich in water ice, and its geology dominated by magnesium silicates like olivine or garnet, the report said, which means it would’ve been rocky and maybe even tectonically active . That is, before it got eaten. One imagines a gargantuan cloud of steam emanating from the white dwarf into space: an enormous stellar burp.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:05:25.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
