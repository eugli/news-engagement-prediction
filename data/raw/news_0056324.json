The three rings of acts were magical. I loved watching three trapeze shows simultaneously. The excitement of the audience during the triple somersault was palpable. Clowning was also an art. I will always cherish these memories.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story — Melanie Sloan, 65, Los Angeles “As a child, I enjoyed the wire walkers, trapeze artists, acrobats and clowns, as well as the overall spectacle — the colors, lights, costumes. I am 100 percent behind removing animal acts from circuses, but there is really something wonderful about a circus, even without animal acts, especially for children.” — Jennifer Zogott Levy, 58, Brooklyn “I went to the circus every year in the ’50s. It was at the old Madison Square Garden and what a treat it was. Yes, I loved going to the basement area to see the freak sideshow. The animals waiting in their cages. Even though the smell of animal feces was, well, disgusting, I still loved it.” — Joan Lorberbaum Moore, 69, Delray Beach, Fla. Photo Ringling’s use of elephants was phased out last year. Credit Neal Boenzi/The New York Times It’s Time to Say Farewell “Like many people, I had nice experiences as a kid seeing the circus, but that was long before I knew what was ‘behind the scenes.’ I can’t imagine enjoying anything like that now. Who can take pleasure in a ‘spectacle’ based on many cases of animal cruelty?” — Jeff Barton, 55, Manhattan “I took my son on his eighth birthday to Ringling Bros. at the Barclays Center a couple of years ago. What a boring, aggravating cash grab it was. Halfway through the horses running around the ring for the seventh straight minute, my son asked if we could leave. I said, ‘Sure.’ This after spending over $150 on tickets, toys, popcorn and junk.” — Bill McClane, 45, Astoria, N.Y. Here’s what else is happening: Weather The weather continues putting on quite the circus act, leaving us oohing and aahing. We’re expecting highs in the 60s until Saturday — yes, in the middle of February — and we’ll be flip-flopping between sunshine, clouds and rain throughout.
