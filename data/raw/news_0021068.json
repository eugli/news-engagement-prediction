A salt dome disguised as a junglescape paradise, it lies amongst the bayou and channel encircled hinterlands of the state’s southern heel. Although it’s only a two-and-a-half hour drive from New Orleans , you have to be going to Avery Island on purpose. \nWhich is why it’s even more puzzling to find one the headquarters of one of the world’s most recognizable food brands there. While it’s been nearly 150 years since Edmund McIlhenny sold his original pepper sauce recipe in used cologne bottles, his company still ships its famous Tabasco red sauce (and 6 others now) from a large brick warehouse on the island. One of the few differences: it ships to over 180 countries now from Sweden to Saudi Arabia. \nWhile I was on Avery Island recently, I toured the Tabasco facility with my new best friend Dave Landry. Dave worked at Tabasco for more than 30 years, and although he’s retired now, you wouldn’t know it. He grew up on the island with a French-speaking family; his mother worked on the bottling line of Tabasco, and he himself worked several different areas from scooping pepper mash into barrels to managing the warehouse. He still lives on Avery Island (as do the 5th generation proprietors of Tabasco) and gives encyclopedic tours to some of the 150,000 people who visit annually. Here’s a behind-the-scenes look at how the most famous pepper sauce in America is made. A video posted by Hannah Hayes (@hayeshannah) on Jan 20, 2017 at 12:26pm PST \nTabasco grows their heirloom namesake pepper from seedlings in greenhouses on Avery Island and sends them to countries like Honduras, Mexico, Guatemala, even Zimbabwe to grow into full size pepper plants. They’re all harvested by hand using an incredibly high tech-tool: a stick painted a specific shade of red so pickers can match it against the color of the pepper and determine whether it’s ripe enough. Once the peppers are picked, they’re sent back to Tabasco headquarters. \nRELATED", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:48:37.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
