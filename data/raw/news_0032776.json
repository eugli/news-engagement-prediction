But she admits herself that she is far from being an 'expert' on the history of women's rights - and claims she 'doesn't deserve all the respect' she has received from her supporters since. Hiding: The Harry Potter star, 26, says that her self-esteem took such a hit, she fell into a '24-hour sulk' and had a battle on her hands even to get out of bed after she was slammed for founding her UN-backed HeForShe drive In demand: Despite a tide of negativity against her, Emma (pictured above on the Women's March in Washington) has since been in demand to speak more on the subject - and even pen a book More to learn: Emma admits herself that she is far from being an 'expert' on the history of women's rights - and claims she 'doesn't deserve all the respect' she has received from her supporters since She adds: 'I need to see and do a bit more first. It's not like I have been reading this material for years and I don't have an encyclopedic knowledge. It can be a lot of pressure sometimes, as people expect me to know so much. 'I'm no expert, and people push me into a corner... it's uncomfortable because I have a long way to go. I am not sure I deserve all the respect I get yet, but I'm working on it.' Last year, Emma revealed that even as Hollywood star she is not immune from unwanted advances - and has even had her bottom slapped by a stranger. The actress said that her celebrity does not protect her from leering men and some have followed her home. In one particularly galling instance, a man slapped her bottom as she left a room.

The Brit, who played Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films, said that talking about women's rights was 'the most fun I've ever had'. She told People magazine: 'We are not supposed to talk about money, because people will think you're 'difficult' or a 'diva.' 'But there's a willingness now to be like: fine. Call me a 'diva', call me a 'feminazi', call me 'difficult,' call me a 'First World feminist', call me whatever you want, it's not going to stop me from trying to do the right thing and make sure that the right thing happens.

Emma drew on her personal experiences to show that she too has had to endure sexism. She said: 'I've had my a**e slapped as I've left a room. I've felt scared walking home. I've had people following me. 'I don't talk about these experiences much, because coming from me they'll sound like a huge deal and I don't want this to be about me, but most women I know have experienced it and worse'.Watson said that the only way things would change is if men heard her message.
