(Reuters: Chaiwat Subprasom) \nThai police charged 22 people with wildlife trafficking in June last year, including three Buddhist monks, and removed more dead animals, including a bear and a leopard, from the tourist attraction. \nTiger Temple was a major tourist attraction for more than two decades, with visitors paying 600 baht ($23) admission to pose for photographs with the animals. \nWildlife activists accused the temple of illegally breeding the tigers, while some visitors on online forums complained that the tigers appeared sedated. \nThe temple denied the accusations. \nIt also said tigers had a high infant mortality rate and claimed deceased cubs were kept in jars or frozen to preserve them. \nBut Thailand's Department of National Parks (DNP) said the preservation indicated the cubs must have been of value to the temple.

(Reuters: Chaiwat Subprasom) \nWorld Animal Protection has called for the DNP to refuse Golden Tiger Co Ltd a license and to impose a breeding ban. \n\"Tiger venues need to be stopped in their tracks because they clearly have links to the dark side of wildlife trafficking rings,\" Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach, a senior wildlife advisor at World Animal Protection said. \nLegal cases and police investigations into the Tiger Temple are ongoing.
