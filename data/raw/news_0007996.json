Mandatory reporting 'needed within private hospitals' \nSarah Atkinson, medical negligence principal at Maurice Blackburn law firm, believed the real number of serious mistakes could be much higher than the 47 reported. \n\"It's great that we have access to these figures within public hospitals, but negligence doesn't just happen within public hospitals, it happens in private hospitals as well,\" she said. \n\"We think it would be great if there was mandatory reporting in private hospitals ... it's difficult to speculate but you'd think there would be at least the same rate of incidents.\" \nMs Atkinson said people who suffered from sentinel errors could receive up to $350,000 in compensation, but such high payouts rarely occurred in Queensland. \nIn a media conference today, Dr Wakefield acknowledged serious errors had occurred in public hospitals but said he was pleased with the culture of Queensland Health staff reporting mistakes. \n\"Sometimes simple mistakes can lead to really catastrophic outcomes for patients, and our job and the job of my team particularly is to do everything we can to prevent these things from happening,\" he said. \n\"Our obligation is to learn from them.\" \nWith more than 1 million cases of care in Queensland's health system each year, Australian Medical Association Queensland president Chris Zappala said the percentage of mistakes was extremely low. \n\"Of course I'd love it to be zero and we're working towards being zero, but it's definitely not increasing so that's a good thing,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T15:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:34:17.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
