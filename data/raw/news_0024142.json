Bad jokes aplenty. Can be gently prodded on Twitter at @kitsb1 \nNow, in a world where countless millions (if not billions) of us can freely choose to watch whichever superhero movie we so choose at any moment in time, it's arguably a little curious that we collectively spend so much time arguing about which of them we should and shouldn't watch. After all, for all that some among us may think that the movies of the #MarvelCinematicUniverse are simplistic and generic, say, or that the #DCEU is needlessly dark and tonally ham-fisted, there's really no reason for that to stop us watching as many, or as few, of them as we so choose. DC's 'Justice League': News, Rumors, Theories, Trailers & All You Need To Know \nAnd yet, and yet, and yet, take a stroll around the interweb's more cobweb-cloaked corners, and stumble into the \"wrong\" forum or comments section, and you're still liable to be screamed at in all caps for suggesting that Ant-Man is a lot of fun, or that Suicide Squad was better than Guardians of the Galaxy . The #DC / #Marvel rivalry is alive and well online — and in an age of seemingly ever-increasing political and social polarization, it seems unlikely that its walls will be broken down anytime soon. Unless, that is, you happen to ask someone who actually works in the relevant industry . Y'see: 'Daredevil' Showrunner Steven DeKnight Just Defended Zack Snyder On Twitter 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' [Credit: Warner Bros] \nWhich, considering the fact that DeKnight played as big a part as anybody in defining the visual style and narrative thrust of one of Marvel's most critically acclaimed on-screen projects, Season 1 of #Daredevil , is actually pretty intriguing. After all, #BatmanVSuperman and #JusticeLeague director #ZackSnyder has long been something of a punching bag for disgruntled Marvel and DC fans alike, who've often seen his darker, more visual-centric approach to the DCEU as a major reason for its underachievement both critically and financially. \nWhich makes DeKnight's recent Twitter posts regarding Snyder pretty darned sweet, actually: Most people get a bad rap on the Internet. I think he's brilliant, and works incredibly hard to advance the language of film. https://t.co/CJQils4A7c — Steven DeKnight (@stevendeknight) February 6, 2017 Loved Watchman. An insanely difficult adaption, faithful to the spirit of the source material and beautifully realized. https://t.co/q2n6Fs8UNm — Steven DeKnight (@stevendeknight) February 6, 2017 \nAfter all, while the rest of the interweb slowly descends into a giant flame-war of tireless, blinkered screaming, it's perhaps worth reminding ourselves every now and then that the actual folks making all of the things we love tend to think that the \"other side\" is making some pretty neat stuff, too. \nY'know, that, and that maybe we shouldn't scream at one another on the internet (or in person, ideally) quite so much. \nWhat do you think, though? Do you agree with DeKnight about Zack Snyder? And if not, should that matter enough to get mad at him? Let us know below! \nHead over to Movie Pilot video for more cool Easter Egg and theory videos.
