But that wasn't the case at 2017's Oscars Sunday night (February 26) in the Best Documentary Feature category. Four of the five nominated films this year tackled overtly political issues â€” including the winner, O.J.: Made in America , director Ezra Edelman's eight-hour, five-part epic exploring O.J. Simpson's life, career, and eventual murder trial against the backdrop of race relations in the U.S. \nThe feature's nomination initially spawned some confusion: Should it be considered a film or a piece of television, as it aired on both ABC and ESPN? (One anonymous Oscar voter even mixed it up with 2016's FX series American Crime Story: The People v O.J. Simpson .) Edelman acknowledged this in his acceptance speech, calling his feature an \"untraditional film.\" \nAs he stood onstage with producer Caroline Waterlow, Edelman also shouted out two people in particular: Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown, the pair whose 1994 murders placed Simpson on trial for charges of which he was eventually exonerated. \"I want to acknowledge that I wouldn't be standing here tonight if not for two people who aren't here: Ron Goldman, Nicole Brown,\" he said. \"This is for them and their families.\" \n\"It is also for others: the victims of police violence, police brutality, racially motivated violence, and criminal injustice,\" Edelman continued. \"This is their story as well as Ron and Nicole's. I am honored to accept this award on all their behalf.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:57:16.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
