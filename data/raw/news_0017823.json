(Getty Images) More All season long , and come to think of it, even longer , Phil Jackson and Carmelo Anthony have publicly stoked the dumpster fire that their relationship has become , and the most high-profile of celebrity New York Knicks fans has seen enough to put out the flame he once carried for the team president.\nOscar-winning filmmaker Spike Lee, who can be regularly seen sitting front row at Madison Square Garden, hasn’t given up on Melo as the franchise player, but most definitely has quit on Jackson.\n“I’ll pack Phil’s bags for him,” Lee told ESPN . He added, “I think I still believe in Carmelo, but Phil Jackson is making it very difficult for him.”\nWe’re not about to pretend a Hollywood director’s input has any real bearing on the team’s decision-making process, but there’s a whole lot of Knicks fans who would like to see Jackson go (and, for the record, wouldn’t be too broken up about Anthony leaving town, either), and Lee gives them a voice.\n[Follow Ball Don’t Lie on social media: Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | Tumblr ]\nThat Lee’s comments came before beloved 1990s Knicks forward Charles Oakley was arrested for allegedly “going after” not-so-beloved billionaire owner James Dolan during Wednesday’s game only serves as chum for New Yorkers circling the Knicks brass. The Madison Square Garden crowd — and even an NYPD officer — chanting for the guy shoving security guards who stood between him and his shot at Dolan says all we need to know about how Knicks fans feel about the state of the franchise.\nYou know New York is bottoming out when fans are on the same page with Knicks killer Reggie Miller:\nIf you're a FA to be, why would you play for an Owner who treats the past greats like this or a President who stabs star player in the back?\n— Reggie Miller (@ReggieMillerTNT) February 9, 2017\nIt makes me very angry that Reggie Miller is a voice of reason in a matter involving the Knicks. https://t.co/b1DiOH3XiD\n— Dan Devine (@YourManDevine) February 9, 2017\nLike a number of New Yorkers, Lee was once filled with hope by Jackson’s hiring as team president in 2014, embracing Irving Azoff — oft-credited with bringing the two basketball benchmarks together — and literally whispering “thank you” in the the former Live Nation Entertainment Inc. chairman’s ear.\nIt didn’t take long for Jackson to burn that bridge, too, throwing an unnecessary jab at Lee when his team’s most famously loyal fan directed a 2014 documentary called “What is the Triangle Offense?” at the MSG Network’s behest in an attempt to explain the 11-time championship coach’s philosophy.\nPhil said of Spike Lee, \"Spike is an avid Knicks fan who doesn't know anything about basketball.\"\n— Frank Isola (@FisolaNYDN) October 12, 2014\nSpeaking of unnecessary jabs, it was Jackson’s latest hurled at Anthony that was the final straw for Lee and other Knicks faithful. Phil has lobbied for Melo to waive his no-trade clause in an attempt to trade the nine-time All-Star, and that has reportedly only steeled Anthony’s resolve not to waive it. The feud came to a crescendo this week when Bleacher Report’s Kevin Ding wrote a critical column , calling out Melo’s will to win, and the 71-year-old Jackson actually agreed with that sentiment on Twitter .\nBleacher's Ding almost rings the bell, but I learned you don't change the spot on a leopard with Michael Graham in my CBA daze.\n— Phil Jackson (@PhilJackson11) February 7, 2017\nUnderstanding Anthony’s shortcomings as an aging shoot-first forward on a max contract, it’s still hard to imagine any Knicks fan taking Jackson’s side after such unprofessionalism. The Hall of Fame coach is no Hall of Fame executive, and Lee’s latest remarks suggest even he’s come to terms with that.\n[ Sign up for Yahoo Fantasy Basketball | Mock Draft | The Vertical | Latest news ]\nIf this ends with Knicks GM Steve Mills, who joined Lee on SiriusXM NBA Radio to explain Jackson’s hiring back in 2014, doing the same when the old man inevitably packs his bags, we’re here to listen.\nAnd Melo is here to help.\nMelo asked about saying \"I trust in Phil\" 3 yrs ago: \"I did say that huh? You got me.\"\nAsked if it's changed: \"Trust the process.\"\n— Steve Popper (@StevePopper) February 9, 2017\nMore on Yahoo Sports:\n• Former NBA enforcer Charles Oakley arrested at Knicks game\n• Jerry Jones unsure how to resolve Tony Romo’s situation\n• Steph Curry called President Trump an ‘ass’ without calling him an ‘ass’\n• MLB plans to test radical new extra-innings rules\n– – – – – – –\nBen Rohrbach is a contributor for Ball Don’t Lie and Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports.
