The alleged incident occurred in December 2016 at The Commons of Providence in Sandusky, Ohio.   \nIn a video shot by another care worker, Fultz can be seen straddling the man's leg and giving him what appears to be a lap dance. In another scene, she pulls down her pants and flashes her buttocks. \n\"I can show you new things, I can show you new things,\" she says to the elderly man on the video. \"I won’t tell if you won’t. I’m a girl ... you know what that means.\"   \nThe acts seen on the video were described as \"basically harassment\" by Sandusky Police Detective Anthony Bath, as quoted by the Sandusky Register. \"She is touching him. This was not something he wanted. He did not want this going on.\" \n\"It's disturbing to see an elderly subject being treated that way, and he has no way of defending himself because he's 100 years old and he's diagnosed with dementia,\" Bath told WJW. \nStaci Lehmkuhl, executive director of The Commons of Providence, issued a statement following Fultz's arrest: \"The employee was placed on administrative leave and has since been terminated. We are cooperating with local police who are handling the investigation and we will not comment further about the ongoing investigation.\" The employee who filmed the video was also fired, it was revealed. \nFultz was booked into Eerie County Jail on Feb. 17 and released on the same day. Her scheduled court appearance for Feb. 21 was postponed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:54:32.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
