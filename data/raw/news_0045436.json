So inspirational was Jones' innings that many reckon it is one of the most courageous ever. In oppressive heat and humidity, the Victorian batsman buckled down - literally, for he fell over sick several times - and batted more than eight hours to score 210, after centuries to David Boon and skipper Allan Border . Footage of Jones' crumbling to the grass owing to a combination of dehydration, exhaustion and no doubt the stench emanating from a canal that sneaked around the ground has been viewed countless times on YouTube. Towards the end of his innings, he batted on instinct as his body gave way. Egged on by Border's 'Weak Victorian' comment, Jones etched his name into history. \n\nThis epic Test ended in a tie when India's last man, Maninder Singh, was adjudged lbw by umpire V Vikramraju, just the second instance of a match ending with the scores level. \n\nAdam Gilchrist 122, Mumbai 2001 \n\n\nSteve Waugh 's team had won 15 Test matches in a row. Expectations were high of a sweet 16th, and that was exactly what happened across three days at the Wankhede Stadium in the series opener of the 2000-01 series. India were bowled out on day one for 176, but fought back to have Australia 99/5. Gilchrist strode to the crease to join Matthew Hayden , who had buckled down and was firm at one end, and proceeded to shift the tone of the innings and, subsequently, the Test. Once set, the left-hander tore into the bowling and sped to a century in 84 balls, needing just 108 minutes to do so. It was the second-fastest century by an Australian, and quickest versus India. \n\nWhat was astonishing was how, with Harbhajan Singh getting the ball to turn sharply, Gilchrist counter-attacked with sweeps, cuts and inside-out drives. It was carnage, and that 122 put Australia on course for the series lead. \n\nMichael Clarke 151*, Bangalore 2004 \n\n\nThis was a much-anticipated debut, and the blue-eyed boy wonder backed the hype with a splendid century in his first at-bat in Tests. Clarke walked into bat at No 6, with the score reading 149/4, and began assembling a thoroughly exquisite innings. The standout feature was his application against spin. Clarke, on 98, replaced his helmet with the baggy green, and kissed it with great emotion when he got to three figures. After the landmark, he opened up in intent, hitting Anil Kumble for two sixes over midwicket on the way to 151. Clarke had landed in India already tipped as a future Test captain, and recently having signed the biggest sporting-brand sponsorship deal in Australian cricket history, and delivered the goods. \n\nDamien Martyn 113 & 97, Nagpur 2004 \n\nAustralia, now led by Gilchrist after injury ruled out Ricky Ponting , took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the best-of-four series with a huge 342-run victory. In doing so, they conquered 'the final frontier' and won their first series in India in 35 years. This massive victory had several lead players, but none greater than Damien Martyn, who scored his ninth Test century and came three runs short of a tenth. In the first innings, Martyn handled India's spinners with silken artistry, scoring 114 off 165 balls out of a total of 398. In the second, he extended a big lead with 97 off 184 balls. His twin innings were masterclasses in how to tackle spin and pace, and fetched Martyn the Man-of-the-Match award. \n\nMichael Kasprowicz 5/28, Bangalore 1998 \n\nAustralia had been beaten in the first two Tests, and could only have hoped to end the series with a face-saving win in Bangalore. But where would the defining performance come from, considering the growing injury list and the margins of defeat (179 runs and an innings and 219 runs)? \n\nStep up, Michael Kasprowicz. After two even first innings each - India made 424, Australia 400 - the decisive blows were struck by the fast bowler on day four, which proved to be the end of the Test as Australia won by eight wickets. Running in from wide of the stumps, the Queenslander struck two crippling blows to remove India's two star batsmen early into the morning session.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:10:42.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
