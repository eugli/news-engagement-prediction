President Donald Trump shakes hands with Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., on Feb. 20, 2017. Susan Walsh / AP \nIn remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in May 2016, McMaster said Russia managed to annex Crimea and intervene militarily in eastern Ukraine \"at zero cost\" from the international community. \nMcMaster said Moscow's broader goal is to \"collapse the post-Cold War security, economic and political order in Europe and replace that order with something that is more sympathetic to Russian interests.\" \nIn his role as a three-star general and military leader, McMaster has studied the way Russia developed and executed its campaigns in Crimea and Ukraine, where it used what some call \"hybrid warfare\" — part political, part disinformation, part military. \nRelated: Veteran CIA Analyst Quits Agency Over Trump's Intel Moves, Criticism \nJames Stavridis, a retired U.S. Navy Admiral, said he expects McMaster will continue to question White House leadership and believes the president will be open to his criticism. \n\"What I'm concerned about is what happens when Lt. Gen. McMaster is on a track that is in disagreement with other figures in the White House, notably [policy adviser] Steve Bannon?\" Stavridis asked on MSNBC Tuesday. \n\"The essence of this brilliant scholar-warrior is that he will speak truth to power,\" he added.
