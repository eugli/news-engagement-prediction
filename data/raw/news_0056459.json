The harmonious rock cut was released alongside the piano-driven jam \"My Day,\" which also performs well on the chart, starting at No. 6. \nFurthermore, \"You Were Beautiful\" beats out a competitive week of K-pop releases, outcharting Red Velvet 's \"Rookie,\" (at No. 4 this week), Block B 's \"Yesterday\" (which debuts at No. 5) and Chanyeol and Punch's collaboration \"Stay With me\" (No. 8). \n\"You Were Beautiful\" is the lead track off the February iteration of the band's \"Every DAY6\" release plan where the outfit will drop new music every month in 2017. The guys kicked off the ambitious schedule with new songs \"I Wait\" and \"Goodbye Winter\" in January, which opened at Nos. 3 and 6 on World Digital Song Sales, respectively. \"I Wait\" returns to the chart this week at No. 24 for its third week on the tally. \nTo date, DAY6 has landed six entries on World Digital Song Sales, peaking as high as No. 3 with both \"You Were Beautiful\" and \"I Wait.\" By committing to monthly releases that, so far have all come with quality music and stunning music videos, DAY6 could certainly score their first No. 1 on World Digital Song Sales to put them an elite group with BIGBANG , BTS , Blackpink and others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:43:33.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
