It's affected his speech over the last year or two. \n\"Sometimes, if something annoys him, he can still say a few words like 'don't do that'. But in general he finds it very difficult. It's not because he doesn't know how to speak. There's just a part of his brain that won't let him. I miss the conversation.\" \nThe McNeills decided to bring their experiences into the open as the 50th anniversary of the Lisbon Lions' historic victory in May 1967 approaches.

Heading the ball and the possibilities of concussive effects on the brain needs more discussion. \n\"We don't know if Billy's dementia is linked to his football. More research needs to be done.\" \nCeltic chief executive Peter Lawwell said a proportion of the proceeds of a forthcoming Celtic FC Foundation charity match will go towards supporting people with dementia. \nHe said: \"Billy is a man of true stature, someone who has given so much of his life to Celtic and at all times with such grace, humility and dignity. \n\"He is respected by all in football and someone who will always be loved dearly by all Celtic supporters.\" \nMr Lawwell added: \"We have always been in close contact with Billy and his family and have been well aware for some time of the challenges he has been facing, a situation he has met with true bravery, a quality synonymous with Billy McNeill. \n\"I know Liz has been an absolute tower of strength too for Billy. Her compassion and care for Billy has been crucial and I would like to pay tribute to her and the rest of the family. \n\"He is a very special man and everyone at Celtic will continue to give Billy and his family every support.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T14:18:41.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
