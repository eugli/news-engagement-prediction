The 2011 nuclear accident at Fukushima was triggered by a devastating earthquake and tsunami, which left more than 18,000 people dead or missing \nThe robot , 60 centimetres (24 inches) long, is made by Toshiba and equipped with two cameras and sensors to gauge radiation levels and temperatures. \n\"Scorpion's mission is to take images of the situation and collect data inside the containment vessel,\" TEPCO spokesman Shinichi Nakakuki said earlier. \n\"Challenges include enduring high levels of radiation and moving on the rough surface,\" he said. \nRadiation levels inside the reactor were estimated last week at 650 sieverts per hour at one spot, which can effectively shut down robots in hours. \nBut the probe—designed to withstand up to 1,000 sieverts of radiation in total—would not sustain severe damage because it was unlikely to remain for too long at a single point, Nakakuki said. Japan estimates the total cost of the Fukushima disaster could reach 21.5 trillion yen ($189 billion) as high radiation levels slow decontamination operations near the striken reactors", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:33:19.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
