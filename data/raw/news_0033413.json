Pic/AFP \nLondon: Director Damien Chazelle's musical \"La La Land\" continued its award dominance by taking five trophies, including the best film and best actress for Emma Stone, at the 70th British Academy Film Awards, which also recognised British-Indian star Dev Patel in the best supporting actor category for \"Lion\".\n\"La La Land\", which also won Chazelle a best director Bafta, is expected to sustain its momentum at the Oscars on February 26 where it has scored a record 14 nominations.\nVeteran director Ken Loach's \"I, Daniel Blake\" was named outstanding British film at the ceremony on Sunday night.\nCasey Affleck was named best actor for \"Manchester by the Sea\" while its director Kenneth Lonergan won the award for best original screenplay.\n\nBritish actor Dev Patel poses with the award for a Supporting Actor for his work on the film 'Lion' at the BAFTA British Academy Film Awards at the Royal Albert Hall in London on February 12, 2017.

Having won the other major awards this season as well, Davis is a strong contender at the Oscars too.\nWhile the Golden Globes were dominated by Meryl Streep's moving speech criticising US President Donald Trump, he was not mentioned that much at the Baftas though Stone referred to him indirectly while accepting her best actress trophy.\n\"This country - and the US, and the world - seems to be going through a bit of a time, just a bit.\n\"In a time that's so divisive, I think it's so special we were able to come together tonight thanks to Bafta, to celebrate the positive gift of creativity and how it can transcend borders and how it can help people to feel a little less alone,\" Stone said.\nPatel, 26, was greeted with a round of applause as he accepted the prize for best supporting actor for \"Lion\", about a man who was adopted as a child and is trying to find his family in India through the help of Google maps.\nThe actor seemed stunned, saying, \"Wow, that just happened.\"\nPatel said the film is about a love that \"transcends borders, race, colour, anything\".\n\"Arrival\", which was nominated for nine Baftas alongside \"Nocturnal Animals\", won just one trophy for best sound while the Tom Ford-directed movie had to return empty handed.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were guests of honour at the star-studded ceremony, held at London's Royal Albert Hall.
