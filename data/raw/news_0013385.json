JRE says the show is based on a tell-all book written by Pete Salgado ... who was Jenni's \"on and off manager\" for many years. \nAccording to the docs, obtained by TMZ, Salgado had signed a non-disclosure agreement with the late singer, and his collaboration with the weekly TV series' producers is a flagrant breach of that contract. JRE points out Univision promoted the series as a look at Jenni's life through Salgado's eyes. \nJRE adds the show is filled with defamatory scenes about Jenni and her 5 children ... although it doesn't specify any scenes. It's suing for at least $10 million in damages. \nWe don't know how accurate it is, but we'll say this ... some of the show comes off like soft porn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T18:26:58.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
