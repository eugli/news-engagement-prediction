Diana Prince's (Gal Gadot) solo movie will mark the first ever mainstream comic book adventure fronted by a major female superhero, which means Wonder Woman will represent an undeniable watershed moment for the genre when it finally hits theaters. This raises one significant question: how good is the movie? It seems that reactions from test audiences are starting to appear online, and it seems that (for the most part) fans have responded positively to the final product. Check out the tweet below to see for yourself. Loving everything I'm hearing from the #WonderWoman test screening. Have so much faith in this film, in @PattyJenks and @GalGadot ! BRING IT! pic.twitter.com/oEUv5cXUDL — Adam Hlavac (@adamhlavac) February 19, 2017 \nSo right off the bat, it seems that people who have seen Wonder Woman are certainly taking to Twitter to tell the world that the movie is good. Test audiences have responded well to the first cut of the film that has screened for a lucky few members of the moviegoing populace, and there seems to be a growing sense of excitement about the project. \nAlthough specific details about the quality of the film remain obscure (at best), it appears that the movie is definitely better than the two DC projects that preceded it in 2016. Opinions about movies are obviously subjective, but the fact that test audiences enjoyed Wonder Woman bodes well for the future of the DCEU. @Daniel_Eliesen looks like someone may have already done so pic.twitter.com/vSykYmojL4 — Josh Myers (@JoshMyers721) February 19, 2017 \nHowever, others have pointed out some critical caveats about test audiences that are always worth remembering. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice similarly made a great impression on test crowds who saw the movie before its full theatrical release, and that film ultimately debuted to a lukewarm response from critics and mainstream audiences alike. These early screenings are not an exact science. Not getting excited about Wonder Woman screening being positive,BvS screening was positive an critics crippled the movie like they will here — DCEU SOCIETY (@DCEU_Society) February 19, 2017 \nOddly enough, there seems to be one particular aspect of Wonder Woman that has shined above all the rest: Chris Pine. Some members of the test crowds have specifically singled him out as the best part of the movie, which means that we can look forward to a fantastic depiction of Steve Trevor when the film finally debuts. So I heard Chris Pine overshadows Gal Gadot's performance in #WonderWoman , i dont mind it but i hope it's not true, it's WW movie — DCU Defender (@TheDCDefender) February 20, 2017 \nAs exciting as that development is, it also raises questions about whether or not he outshines Gal Gadot. Wonder Woman was a standout character during her appearance in Dawn of Justice , so we're just hoping that she can recapture that magic this time around. \nWe will bring you more information related to Wonder Woman as new details become available to us. The female-fronted superhero epic will blast its way into theaters this summer on June 2, 2017. \nLooking for an even closer glimpse at Patty Jenkins' upcoming DC superhero adventure?
