That is a double life.\" \n\"There are those who say 'I am very Catholic, I always go to Mass, I belong to this and that association',\" the head of the 1.2 billion-member Roman Catholic Church said, according to a Vatican Radio transcript. \nHe said that some of these people should also say \"'my life is not Christian, I don't pay my employees proper salaries, I exploit people, I do dirty business, I launder money, (I lead) a double life'.\" \n\"There are many Catholics who are like this and they cause scandal,\" he said. \"How many times have we all heard people say 'if that person is a Catholic, it is better to be an atheist'.\" \nS ince his election in 2013, Francis has often told Catholics , both priests and lay people, to practice what their religion preaches. \nIn his often impromptu sermons, he has condemned sexual abuse of children by priests as being tantamount to a \"Satanic Mass\", said Catholics in the mafia excommunicate themselves, and told his own cardinals to not act as if they were \"princes\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:47:24.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
