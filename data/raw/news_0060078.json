Eighteen-year-old Grala now becomes the youngest winner ever at Daytona in any of NASCAR’s national series. \nBen Rhodes lost control of his truck as what was left of tonight’s race traffic went three-wide on the last lap, sending his truck into Crafton’s at the front of the pack as it approached the checkered flag. Advertisement Advertisement \nOuch. \nThe race restarted with only three laps to go after John Hunter Nemechek spun out on lap 95 of the 100-lap race. Sponsored \nRookie Grala is so young and new at this, he claimed that he didn’t know what to do to celebrate—including not knowing how to do a donut. His radio cord also came loose on lap 79, leaving him without any kind of spotter information at one of NASCAR’s most chaotic venues until the cord connection jiggled back into place at the very end of the race.
