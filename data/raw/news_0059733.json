Jarzembowski were issued formal complaints, orders of summary suspension and orders to cease and desist, according to a news release from the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. \nThe funeral home has 60 days to either assign its prepaid contracts to another party or cancel the contracts and issue refunds. The allegations stem from an audit revealed multiple violations of the Prepaid Funeral and Cemetery Sales Act, according to the news release. \nIt is a felony for a funeral home to use prepaid contract funds for use other than what's authorized under the act, and the penalties per violation range to a fine of $5,000 or less than five years in prison. \nA woman who answered the phone at Jarzembowski Funeral Home said she wasn't aware of the allegations and didn't immediately provide comment. \nPeople who have questions or concerns regarding this case can call the Securities and Audit Division in LARA's Corporations, Securities and Commercial Licensing bureau at (517) 335-5237, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., or by emailing LARA-CSCL-Securities-Audit@michigan.gov. \nContact Robert Allen on Twitter @rallenMI or rallen@freepress.com. 2 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:15:12.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
