The amended budget in July 2015 was 303 billion CFA francs. Now we know that the cost was 192 billion,\" he added. \nThe organisers also defended crowds at the tournament, hitting back at suggestions attendances were worse than usual.

The overall attendance was around 330-350,000,\" Kerangall said. \n\"We estimate that around 66 percent of seats were filled prior to the final, where the stadium was completely full,\" he added, affirming that usually stadiums are no more than 40 percent full on average at the Cup of Nations. \nStadiums often filled as matches went on with supporters frequently late arriving, although a nadir was reached for the group game between Tunisia and Zimbabwe. \nThen, only 1,800 people attended the match at the 40,000-seat Stade de l'Amitie in Libreville. \nCameroon beat Egypt 2-1 in Sunday's final to win the trophy for the fifth time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:45:00.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
