If you're an art lover, or even someone who's into architecture and history, the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan is well worth including on your itinerary. Located in the triangle of Delhi, Jaipur and Bikaner, many people overlook it in favor of more popular destinations in Rajasthan . However, this unique region is often referred to as the world's largest open air art gallery.\nThe old havelis (mansions), with walls adorned with intricate painted frescoes, are the main attraction in the Shekhawati region.\nThe region's background is fascinating. It was established in the 18th century along a caravan trade route, and ruled by the Shekhawat Rajputs. The region was a prosperous one, with over 100 villages, and 50 forts and palaces.\nOver the next century, many people from the neighboring Marwar community migrated to Shekhawati and made it their home. These rich business people commissioned artists to paint frescoes on their homes as a sign of opulence. Painted havelis cropped up all over the desert landscape. The art was kept alive for nearly 300 years. However, eventually, more and more families settled elsewhere. These days many homes are abandoned, locked up, and neglected.\nHow to Get There The Shekhawati region is best approached from Jaipur or Bikaner, in Rajasthan, or Delhi . If you want to take the train from Delhi, Indian Railways trains depart from Delhi Sarai Rohilla station and go via Churu (on the outskirts of the region) to Bikaner or Jodhpur. Travel time is approximately 4.5 hours.\nThere are more frequent departures from Jaipur, and they conveniently stop at Nawalgarh. Travel time is approximately 3.5 hours. The nearest airport is in Jaipur, around 150 kilometers away.\nHiring a car and driver is recommended and facilitates easy touring of the region. From Jaipur, V Care Tours and Travel provide top quality car and driver services. Their cars are new and clean, and the very courteous drivers are uniformed and English speaking. If you don't have a car, you can explore by everything from horseback to bus.\nViator also offer this Two Day Private Tour to Mandawa from Jaipur and Six Day Golden Triangle and Mandawa Private Tour from Delhi . Both tours are easily bookable online!\nFor a longer and more in depth experience of the Shekhawati region, this Straight from the Art trip from Breakaway is recommended, departing from either Delhi or Jaipur.\nWhen to Go The main tourist season extends from October until March, when the weather is the coolest and driest. If you go in early February, you'll be able to catch the annual Shekhawati Festival that takes place in Nawalgarh. Winter nights are cold though, so do pack warm clothing!\nRead More: Best Places to See Shekhawati Havelis\n1 of 4 Show All 1 2 Best Places to See Shekhawati Havelis 3 Shekhawati Rajasthan Map 4 Where to Stay in Shekhawati 2 of 4 Best Places to See Shekhawati Havelis Use to navigate.\nNadine Le Prince Cultural Center, Fatehpur. Photo Credit: Sharell Cook. As the Shekhawati region is spread out over around 100 kilometers, it's a good idea to choose a base for yourself, keeping in mind that the roads from north to south are in much better condition than the roads from east to west. You'll most likely find that a few days in the region are enough, as to be honest, the painted havelis are similar and some people find that viewing one after another becomes monotonous.\nIf you feel like relaxing though, Shekhawati is a peaceful region for some time out.\nNawalgargh and Mandawa are two recommended bases. Mandawa is arguably the best choice, as it's centrally located for exploring the region and is popular with travelers.\nNawalgarh : Nawalgarh is a vibrant town with a great blend of accommodation options (which are absent in smaller towns and villages) and painted havelis, which number in the hundreds. The finest frescoes can be found here. Some of the most attractive havelis are the Aath (eight) Haveli complex, Jodhraj Patodia Haveli, Bansidhar Bhagat Haveli, and Chokhani Haveli. Do check out the town's colorful bazaar and fort too. The Morarka Haveli Museum is a landmark and depicts the various motifs prevalent in the frescoes. The Dr Ramnath A Podar Haveli Museum, built in the 1920s on the eastern side of town, also has vibrant murals. If you want to get around the Shekhawati region on horseback, Nawalgargh is the place to start from.\nMandawa : The small market town of Mandawa has more of a rural Rajasthani village feel and dozens of decorated Shekhawati havelis. However, some of them are sadly dilapidated. The town is dominated by an imposing fort, turned into a hotel. For a panoramic view over the town, head up to the terrace of the Mandawa Castle . There are plenty of attractive accommodation options in Mandawa.\nOther Places Worth Exploring Jhunjhunu : The Old Capital and largest town in the region. Located in the north, it has a number of painted havelis, as well as an old palace and numerous temples. However, it lacks the charm of the smaller villages.\nFatehpur : Fatehpur, founded in the mid 15th century and taken over by Shekhawati Rajputs in the 18th century, has many painted havelis. Unfortunately, again, many haven't been well maintained. Do have a look at the frescoes on the walls of the Devra and Singhania Havelis, which combine Indian and Western styles. Surprisingly, the mirror work at the entrance has Japanese tiles with images of Mount Fuji. The Nadine le Prince Cultural Center is also a major point of interest. It's located in a haveli that was bought and restored by a French artist. There are various art galleries inside. The entry fee is 200 rupees.\nRamgargh : This was once one of Shekhawati's wealthiest towns. The temples are particularly interesting and provide variation from the havelis.\nMahansar : The lovely small town of Mahansar was settled by the prosperous Podder family who dealt in opium and chintz. The town flourished until one of the Podders lost his livelihood when ships carrying opium sunk. The two main attractions are the Mahansar Fort (there's a heritage hotel there where you can have lunch) and the Sone ki Dukan (Golden Shop) with its gold painted murals that tell the stories of Hindu mythology.\nDunlod : To the south of Mandawa, towards Nawalgarh, Dunlod has a small number of havelis with impressive murals as well as a fort at its center.\nMukundgarh : This town is a renowned craft center. In addition, you'll find one of the biggest havelis in the region there, as well as a fort.\nSuggested Itineraries If you base yourself in Mandawa, you can visit the surrounding towns in circuits. For example:\nDay One : Mandawa-Fatehpur-Ramgargh-Mahansar-Mandawa. Day Two : Mandawa-Mukundgarh-Dunlod-Nawalgarh-Mandawa.

Photo Credit: Sharell Cook. One of the really appealing things about visiting the Shekhawati region is that you can actually stay in some of the beautiful old havelis and completely be transported back to the bygone era.\nBudget travelers will be happy because in many cases, cheap is actually best value for money. Common complaints at the more expensive hotels include bad service, unclean rooms with inconsistent standards, and poor maintenance.\nThe pick of hotels at Nawalgarh are:\nRoop Niwas Kothi (Palace) -- this grand country house located around one kilometer north of the fort was once the residence of the royal family. It received a full makeover in 1928, which added contemporary flare and architecture, and opened for guests in 1981. The hotel has a stable with around 60 horses, which you can take out riding. Expect to pay around 3,000 rupees for a double, per night. Suites are 4,500 rupees per night. Apani Dhani Eco-Lodge -- something completely different, this hotel offers accommodations in attractively constructed mud huts surrounded by fields away from the city center. Plenty of activities are provided to help guests discover daily life and traditions of rural India. Rates start from 1,350 rupees per night. Do be aware that there are a number of rules, such as not being out after 9.30 p.m. Rajesh Jangid Tourist Pension -- guests rave about this sweet but simple place, which has the same owners as Apani Dhani. It stands out for its organic ingredients sourced from local farms, recycling, and cultural workshops lead by local artists.

Castle Mandawa -- a 240 year old fortress that's been converted into a hotel with a spacious courtyard, lofty domes, turrets, and cannons.

It's been lovingly restored and the walls of the inner courtyard are adorned with spectacular detailed frescoes with a Krishna theme. Staff are helpful and service is good. The hotel also offers a range of activities including camel cart rides. Rates start from around 2,000 rupees per night. The Gopesh Suite, at 4,250 rupees a night is a treat, with arches, window seats, and countless windows overlooking the town. It also has a private courtyard.

Room rates range from 3,000-4,000 rupees for double.
