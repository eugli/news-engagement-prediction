A hit at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe last year, this brisk entertainment bears the same relation to its source material as the 1964 Disney film “Mary Poppins” did to the novels that inspired it. That is to say, it’s perfectly enjoyable as a whimsy-splashed showcase for fresh-faced talent. But the distinctive perversity of the author it riffs upon ultimately eludes the talented creators of this hourlong production, which opened on Monday night at the Fourth Street Theater. Saki , the pen name of H. H. Munro (1870-1916), began his writing career as a light-penned political satirist and advanced into a peerless series of brief, perfectly composed tales that unleashed the demons of anarchy into the Edwardian drawing room. His stories informed the imaginations of many a preadolescent (including this reviewer), who thrilled in their discreet gore and nasty baiting of stuffy grown-ups. In “Life According to Saki,” the British children’s book writer Katherine Rundell has reimagined a sampling of these stories as they might have been told by their author in the trenches of World War I, in which he served and died. As introduced by Munro (David Paisley) and performed with music-hall virtuosity by his fellow soldiers, these narratives come to represent British bravado in the face of disaster, the equivalent of whistling a happy tune when afraid.
