A sign posted at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa tells students of Coast Community College District and state restrictions against unauthorized recording of classroom sessions. (Alex Chan | Daily Pilot) Alex Chan touched off a nationwide firestorm, signs reminding students that in-class recordings are prohibited without instructors' permission have been posted in Orange Coast classrooms for the spring semester, which started last week.\nThe signs read: \"Video and/or audio recording without instructor permission is prohibited.\" \nAt the bottom, the signs cite the Coast Community College District's Student Code of Conduct and the California Education Code , which prohibit recordings without permission. \n\"That's always been a policy and I believe that the administration just wants students to know what the policy is,\" said Rob Schneiderman, president of the Coast Federation of Educators, a union that represents instructors in the district. \"The union did not ask for the signs. ... \n\"We're not just concerned about faculty members having words taken out context, but we're also concerned for students who may not want their image, words or questions to be published and widely distributed.\" \nBut Joshua Recalde-Martinez, president emeritus of the Orange Coast College Republicans club, which posted the video on its Facebook page in December, said he considers the signs to be \"a slap in the face of students.\" \n\"One of the things it's doing is suppressing students from reporting faculty wrongdoing,\" he said. \"Another is producing a huge inconvenience to those who otherwise regularly record classes.\" \nProfessor Olga Perez Stable Cox was secretly recorded in her human-sexuality class by an unidentified student days after the Nov. 8 election. In the video , Cox apparently refers to Trump as a \"white supremacist\" and to Vice President Mike Pence as \"one of the most anti-gay humans in this country.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T12:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:36:05.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
