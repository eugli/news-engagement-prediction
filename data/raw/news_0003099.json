Although a few of the attributes we already knew, some may surprise you.\nICYMI: Donald Trump didn't like my Monday column. #singletear cc @Morning_Joe pic.twitter.com/zjhk1qIDAR\n— Jonathan Capehart (@CapehartJ) July 8, 2015 1. He loves attention. Right off the bat you see that Trump’s lettering is large. This speaks to the size of the writer’s personality, the National Pen Company notes (via The Daily Mail ). In fact, heavy capitalization and big, bold lettering suggests a need for attention , and can even give way to a front of false confidence. A false flag!\n2. He's a bully. Similar analysis undertaken by CNN indicates that Trump’s large print is, well, bullish. “A bull is a hyper-masculine animal that pushes its way through things without a lot of elegance.

The Daily Mail adds that Trump uses, “very dark lettering indicating high amounts of pressure pressed against the paper,” and that high pressure reveals, “ a writer who is uptight and reacts quickly to criticism .” That'd be his Twitter shtick, then.\n5. He's cold and power-hungry. As for the President’s famous signature, slapped down on a disturbing number of executive orders already, it \"has absolutely no curves, only angles. Curves in handwriting show softness, nurturing and a maternal nature,” notes Politico . In other words, there is absolutely nothing warm and fuzzy about Trump. On the contrary, angular script demonstrates that the writer is, “feeling angry,” and when handwriting is curveless, “the writer lacks empathy and craves power, prestige and admiration,” explains Michelle Dresbold , author and handwriting expert.\n6. He's \"manly?\" And the best interpretation yet? “Besides the bigheadedness that shows in this script there is something else that is rather over-sized—the “p” in “Trump,” Dresbold reveals. “This large phallic symbol shouts, “Me … big hunk of man.” How.... very....
