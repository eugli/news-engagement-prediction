It was Detroit's first win in newly renovated Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium. \nStarting off: Andrew Romine, Ian Kinsler and Victor Martinez hit back-to-back-to-back home runs in the third inning. Miguel Cabrera, the next batter, was plunked. Tensions mounted. But Cabrera calmed everybody down and walked calmly to first base. Houston Astros pitcher Edison Frias was ejected by home plate umpire Hunter Wendelstedt. \nAt the plate: Cabrera had a pair of hits, including a double off the right-center field wall. … James McCann had a pair of hits with an RBI. ... Romine, Kinsler and Martinez all hit home runs. ... Justin Upton had an RBI double. ... Tyler Collins had an RBI single. He can't play in the field because of a strained lat muscle , but he can hit and run. ... Outfielder Jason Krizan hit a home run. \nOn the mound: Justin Verlander started the game and gave up a hit to the first batter, Norichika Aoki, who hit a tapper to the mound that Verlander couldn’t glove. Aoki stole second but Verlander stranded him there. Verlander had zip on his fastball, an encouraging sign. His slider was a little flat. He threw 33 pitches with one hit and a walk. ... Blaine Hardy pitched a scoreless inning. \nIn the field: Kinsler showed mobility, charging a soft grounder and throwing out Aoki. … Upton made a nice running catch in leftfield. \nOverheard: \"I felt pretty good,\" Verlander said. \"It's a really good first step. I made it through. My arm is still attached.\" \nThree stars: 1. Cabrera, 2. Kinsler, 3. Romine. \nContact Jeff Seidel: jseidel@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @seideljeff .
