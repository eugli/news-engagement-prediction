He was originally arrested on drug charges. He was captured in Cobb County during a traffic stop last week. For the past decade, Dennis Kitchens had been a free man. \nThat is, until a Cobb County police officer pulled Kitchens over for cutting him off on the road, ran a check and found out he had escaped from prison 10 years ago. \nNow, in the year he would’ve gotten out of prison, Kitchens is headed back — all thanks to a Jan. 27 traffic stop. \nAccording to a news release from Cobb County police, Kitchens was driving on Powder Springs Road when he crossed in front of the officer. Family of man captured a decade after escaping the Atlanta Fed Pen tell us why they are relieved.

Kitchens also gave the officer a fake name and had “difficulty coming up with simple facts like how old he was,” police said. \nCrack cocaine, Oxycontin and Alprazolam pills were found inside the car. Police later discovered Kitchens was an escapee from the Atlanta U.S. Penitentiary. \nAccording to Channel 2 Action News, Kitchens was arrested in 2003 on drug charges and sentenced to 12 years and five months in prison in Kentucky. He was transferred in 2006 to the Atlanta prison, where he escaped and has been on the run since, police said. \nKitchens faces drug charges and is being held in the Cobb County Detention Center until he is released to U.S. Marshals.
