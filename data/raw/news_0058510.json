Responding to a query by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Navy Spokesperson said, on Twitter, “@SushmaSwaraj nearest Indian Naval warship is approx 350 Nautical miles East of Aden Yemen presently @SpokespersonMoD”. \n“@SushmaSwaraj @SpokespersonMoD minimum 24 hours steaming time to reach Aden, Yemen,” the Twitter handle @indiannavy said. \nSwaraj was responding to “SOS” message on twitter from a person claiming to be Chief Officer of Indian vessel Jag Prabha which was stuck in Aden. \n“SOS @SushmaSwaraj , pls help me & my wife repatriate India from Aden, Yemen. I am chief officer in indian vessel Jag Prabha, stuck in Aden,” he tweeted. \nIn a tweet exchange, the Minister asked him about the Indian nationals on board. \nHe responded, saying total 23 out of which nine crew are “over due”. \nIn a subtle reprimand, she said, “you know the situation in Yemen. You acted contrary to our advice. You want more people to land in your situation” adding “So we have to evacuate 23 and the Vessel?” \nIn between, the Indian Navy spokesperson gave her the location of the Indian Navy ship and time it would take to reach war torn Aden only to get a cautionary note from twitter users. \nYou May Also Want To Watch: \nThey suggested that such information should not be shared on public platform as there are many piracy incidents in the area. \nResponding to Navy spokesperson’s tweet, Swaraj tweeted, “Please rescue Indian nationals from this ship in Aden (Yemen).” \n“I have requested my colleague @manoharparrikar ji to rescue Indian nationals from your ship. (sic),” she said in another tweet. \n“However, we will not make any exception and permit our citizens to go to Yemen at this time,” she further said. \n“We should all salute the Indian Navy,” she said in another tweet when he thanked her.
