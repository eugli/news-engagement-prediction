Though Prott said Thursday morning he did not have a total tally yet of what sold, there were thousands of items on the auction block. \nNewark Club closes after 24 years \n\"I had over 1,000 dinner plates alone,\" he said. \nThe items' new owners are picking them up Thursday, and demolition of the 22nd floor to make way for new, leasable office space, begins Friday. \nThe auction marked the absolute end of the Newark Club's 24-year history as a reception space for weddings, and an elite club that served as the backdrop to countless political deals. Declining membership prompted the owners of the space to shut the club , Prott said. Since announcing its closure, the manager said he's been inundated with calls and messages from past brides and members recounting fond memories at the club. \n\"It's been the place with the best views, it's been the best place in the city for a very, very long time,\" Mayor Ras Baraka said when asked about his memories of the club. \n\"Right now, there's no place that could replace the Newark Club. ... We've obviously got our work to do to build something else.\" \nStaff reporter Steve Strunsky contributed to this report. \nJessica Mazzola may be reached at . Follow her on Twitter @JessMazzola .
