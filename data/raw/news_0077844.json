Democrats previously held control of all three after the 2008 election that sent former President Barack Obama to the Oval Office. That power began eroding in 2010 amid the Tea Party movement. \n“You know, in a certain way, I hate to see it, because I like a two-party system, and we’re soon going to have a one-party system,” Trump said. “I actually think a two-party system is healthy and good.” \nHe added of Pelosi: “But she’s done a terrible job.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T20:02:24.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
