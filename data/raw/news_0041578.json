Eight years ago in the same hall, his predecessor Joe Biden made headlines with a promise to “reset” relations with Russia. \nREAD MORE: Expect more fake news from Russia, top NATO general says \nBut unlike Biden, Pence came to Munich with a fatal handicap: the perception, fueled by the circumstances surrounding the recent resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn, that he is not part of Trump’s inner circle. \n“His mission was always going to be hard, but it was made even more so by the questions about his lack of influence inside the White House ,” said Derek Chollet, a top defense policy adviser to former president Barack Obama who is now with the German Marshall Fund of the United States. “ROBOTIC SALUTE” \nThe vice president tried to tackle these doubts head-on by making clear at the start of his speech that he was speaking for Trump. \nBut then he went on to mention the president 19 times in the course of the 20-minute speech, prompting one audience member, the author and historian Robert Kagan, to dismiss the address as a “robotic salute to the man in power”. \n“Pence and Mattis and Tillerson can come here and talk about the importance of the transatlantic relationship and NATO – and that is all good,” said Elmar Brok, head of the foreign affairs committee of the European Parliament and a party ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \nWATCH: NATO head remains confident of U.S. commitment to alliance \n“But we don’t know what’s coming on Twitter tomorrow morning,” he said, referring to Trump’s penchant for spilling out policy statements via social media. \nFlynn’s resignation has deepened the mystery over who Trump will listen to on foreign policy, although his chief strategist Steve Bannon and son-in-law Jared Kushner are both seen as influential. \nOne European diplomat likened the challenge of figuring out who to listen to in the Trump administration to the task of “Kremlinologists” during the Cold War. \nREAD MORE: Russia deploys cruise missile, violates Cold War-era treaty \nUlrich Speck, a foreign policy analyst at the Elcano think tank in Brussels, said the conundrum that Henry Kissinger evoked when he famously asked who he should call when he wanted to talk to “Europe” seemed to have been turned on its head. \n“Now Europe is asking who it should call if it wants to talk to the United States,” Speck said. \nBesides his reassurances on NATO and Russia relations, Pence tried to assuage fears that the United States is moving away from democratic values under Trump, who has attacked the media and judiciary repeatedly since taking power a month ago. \n“This is President Trump’s promise,” Pence said. “We will stand with Europe, today and every day, because we are bound together by the same noble ideals – freedom, democracy, justice, and the rule of law.” EU SUPPORT \nThis message was welcomed, but others went down poorly. \nPence raised eyebrows by suggesting that the nuclear deal between the world’s major powers and Iran, which has strong support across Europe, was freeing up resources for Tehran to promote terrorism. \nAnd his repeated references to “radical Islamic terrorism” irked some who feel the Trump administration is targeting all Muslims in its fight against extremists. Merkel explicitly warned against this in a speech just before Pence spoke. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump is working on a new ‘streamlined’ travel ban: John Kelly \nSome audience members were also dismissive of Pence’s promise to relegate Islamic State to the “ash-heap of history”, saying such hyperbolic rhetoric was better suited to a U.S. election campaign than a European audience. \nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault expressed his displeasure with the fact that Pence had not sent a message of support for the European Union, something Munich organizer Wolfgang Ischinger had called on the vice president to do before the conference. \nTrump has praised Britain’s decision to leave the EU and suggested other countries follow, stirring concerns that he could abandon decades of U.S. policy and actively encourage the disintegration of the 28-member bloc. \n“I was struck that he never mentioned the EU,” said Ayrault. © 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:05:09.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
