(Photo: MEN WS) Share Get   \nStains and cracks on the walls, furniture covered in \"layers\" of crunchy dirt -and accessed via a urine-soaked bin alley - this is apparently one of the worst hotels in the UK. \nThe Merchants Hotel in the Northern Quarter has racked up 266 ‘terrible’ ratings out of the 389 on the website - making it the worst in the city. \nOne reviewer said it was like “something out of a horror movie” while another said they’d “rather sleep on the street” than spend another night there. \nBut is it really as bad as all those guests claim? \nManchester Evening News reporter Dianne Bourne decided to stay a night and find out what it is really like. \nWe paid £42 for a single room at the hotel - which came with a shower and sink but not a toilet - instead there was a shared toilet at the end of the corridor. \nAnd you have to pay an extra £2 for a towel. A chair covered in layers of grime (Photo: MEN WS) A £42 single room came with a shower and sink but not a toilet (Photo: MEN WS) \nClearly at this sort of price, no one would expect the Ritz, but I was still shocked to find how basic the state of the room was. \nIt had very dated decor, old patterned carpets and one of the most disgusting chairs I think I have ever layed eyes on, encrusted with various layers of grime, it even crunched to the touch, and the back of the chair was falling off. \nThere were stains and cracks in the walls around the bed, with what looked like previous water damage. \nIndeed, there were more of these stains and cracks on the main stairwell walls - although there was a painter and decorator hard at work when I visited, and bosses have confirmed they have started a programme of improvements to the hotel which will continue throughout 2017. The road leading to The Merchants Hotel in Manchester (Photo: MEN WS) \nThe corridor leading to my room was also clean and well painted, with what looked like a newer carpet, and the shared toilet was, thankfully, nice and clean too. \nIn terms of location, it does have something to boast about - as central as you like just off Piccadilly Gardens, with fantastic access to all city centre attractions, with buses, trams and Piccadilly Train Station all a short stroll away. \nBut the entrance to the hotel on Back Piccadilly comes with it’s own problems - the road is filled with huge wheelie bins, litter spilling on to the street, and an unpleasant stench from the unwelcome, ahem, deposits from the city’s revellers along the gutters. \nI dread to think what first time visitors to Manchester must think when they walk out and see this grimmer than grim street view. \nSure, this is not the fault of the hotel, but its own entrance does little to give a good impression for a guest arriving. There is graffiti on the door, and one of the information boxes contains a dirty looking sheet of paper detailing room prices.

(Photo: MEN WS) \nHeading up to the room to sleep, I’m pleased to see that at least the bed linen looks clean and fresh, and the mattress is comfortable enough as I nestle down to rest. \nAs the mother of a young child, I was looking forward to a rare uninterrupted night’s sleep - but alas even that was not to be. \nFor at 5am I’m awoken by the sound of bins being emptied on Back Piccadilly - and the noise, clear as a bell through the single pane window, just keeps on and on, with a nagging succession of delivery vans, wheeling trollies and breaking bottles, and loud conversations until at 7am I give up trying to rest and just get up out of bed. \nI’m starting to understand why one Trip Advisor reviewer said you might as well “sleep on the street instead”. There were stains and cracks in the walls around the bed, with what looked like previous water damage (Photo: MEN WS) \nWhen I mention the noise to the receptionist as I’m leaving, he apologises and says it’s a constant problem they have which they have raised with the council, and that many other guests have raised a similar complaint, with the noise affecting the rooms on the Back Piccadilly side of the hotel, although I’m told that the en suite rooms are available on the other side of the hotel which are not affected by the noise. \nWe contacted the hotel with the full details of our experience, and manager Shahid Naseeb said the specific issues raised about the bedroom have been flagged and “will receive due attention immediately”. \nHe said: “We are a small family run business in a very competitive market place dominated by multi-national brands. Manager Shahid Naseeb said the specific issues raised about the bedroom have been flagged and “will receive due attention immediately” (Photo: MEN WS) \n“As a running business it is difficult to carry out significant upgrades due to commitments to our guests who book with us many weeks in advance. \n“We have however recognised that to stay competitive and to provide our guests with a comfortable experience we need to improve the amenities on offer. \n“We have an extensive redecoration and improvement plan for 2017. As the building is leased we are limited in the scope of this work due to contractual obligations to not alter the internal footprint of the building. We are however committed to making any improvements that we can.” \nMr Naseeb confirmed that the issues with noise on Back Piccadilly have been reported to Environmental Health. Mr Naseeb said TripAdvisor reviews \"aren’t always objective nor verified\" (Photo: MEN WS) \nHe said: “In regards to the noise outside this is outside of our control. \n\"The development on the old Nobles Arcade has left the area directly in front of our door as a hotbed of noise and at times unruly behaviour. \n\"I have mentioned this to Morrisons, Travelodge and Zizzi who leave their bins on the roadside, but they refuse to move them or arrange collection of these during normal social hours. \n\"I have also reported this to environmental health for noise and cleanliness but have not received any satisfactory response.” \nHe added that the state of Back Piccadilly is now something that all stakeholders in the area need to address. \nIn regards to all those one star TripAdvisor reviews, Mr Naseeb said: “These aren’t always objective nor verified. \nI prefer to focus on our reviews from our online travel agent partners (Expedia and booking.com ) where reviews are objective and verified. We have a 60% rating on these sites and are continually looking to improve this.” \nThe hotel has 23 bedrooms, ranging from basic single rooms with shared toilet and shower facilities starting from £35 a night up to en suite double bedrooms that start at £55.
