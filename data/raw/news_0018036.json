Jeff Sessions was confirmed as attorney general on Wednesday evening. Despite the clamor of protest that has surrounded his confirmation proceedings, Sessions' confirmation was not totally surprising. He needed a simple majority in the Senate, and he conveniently hails from the Senate's own majority party. The vote followed mainly along party lines, which means that if you're looking to continue the protest, you'll need the phone numbers of GOP senators who voted in favor of Sessions. \nSessions earned his confirmation with a 52-47 vote. The one missing vote was his own. Sessions didn't vote yea or nay on his confirmation, but rather, he voted \"present.\" Even without Sessions' vote, Republicans held a slight majority going into the confirmation decision. All 51 remaining Republicans voted for him, as well as one Democrat. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia broke party lines and sided with the GOP. Both Independent senators, Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, voted against Sessions. \nPre-vote protests against Sessions were hard to ignore. For instance, on Tuesday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a prominent Democrat, was silenced during the debate over Sessions' confirmation. Now that Sessions has been confirmed, protestors can specifically target the senators who voted in favor of the new attorney general in an attempt to change the mindset — and the status quo — of the current class of (mostly) GOP senators. We need an Attorney General who’ll defend the Constitution & educate the president about what it means. Jeff Sessions won't be that person.
