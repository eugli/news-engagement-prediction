He called me to his room and demanded Tk 200,000 extortion after becoming president. He threatened to drive me out if I failed to pay. Shahed Bhai was also there,\" Monir Hossain, the leaseholder told bdnews24.com in one of the several conversations in around past one week. \n\"I later had to take loans with interests to pay them Tk 150,000. They recently called me again and asked to pay Tk 30,000 per month. How shall I be able to feed the students after paying this much money?\" he said. Monir alleged Arif threatened to cancel his lease and give it to 'any of the other contractors who are ready to pay the sum'.\nArif, a student of world religions and culture department from Barisal, became president of the hall unit when BCL announced the hall committees last December. General Secretary Shahed, a law department student, hails from Rajbari. \n“If their demand of Tk 30,000 per month is met, the quality of food will drop,” said Monir. \n\"No leader demanded this amount of money after I took charge of the canteen. I provided food for free in various programmes at the hall. I also paid little amounts during the Eid seasons. But now they demand so much money!\" Monir, who has been running the canteen for over a decade, said. \nSeveral students said they also heard about the demand of extortion by the BCL leaders. They also stated that they saw the BCL leaders eating 'free' meals. They requested anonymity. \nThe students also alleged that an internet service provider had to stop operations at the hall after failing to pay extortion demanded by Arif and Shahed. \nArif denied the allegations. \"We believe in Bangabandhu's ideal. These are lies. You can check the matter thoroughly,\" he told bdnews24.com. Dhaka University BCL General Secretary Motaher Hossain Prince said: “he is not aware of the allegation of extortion against Arif and Shahed.”\nHe also said the organisation would investigate the matter if someone brings the complaint. The duo will face organisational actions if found guilty, he added. \nProctor Amzad Ali also said he knew nothing about the matter. \"The hall authorities may know about it,\" he told bdnews24.com. \nKabi Jasimuddin Hall Provost Rahmat Ullah said he received no such allegation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:59:31.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
