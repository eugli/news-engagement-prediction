Health officials say shellfish such as oysters can become contaminated from the water before they are harvested. \nThe common symptoms of gastrointestinal illness are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps which will last one to two days in healthy people. \nAnyone experiencing these symptoms after eating oysters is urged to contact a doctor. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T15:11:12.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
