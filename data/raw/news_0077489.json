Host Jimmy Kimmel was left to look astonished/bemused and try and crack jokes.\nThough the gaff was initially pinned on Beatty/Dunaway, it appears it was a crew member's responsibility to ensure the correct envelopes make it on stage.\nSteve Harvey quickly started trending, his infamous Miss Universe screw-up having been well and truly upstaged:\ntfw you're finally off the hook pic.twitter.com/HlBs1yqbCO \n— Dave Lozo (@davelozo) February 27, 2017 Many joked that maybe Hillary Clinton did win the presidential election after all, and M.

Night Shyamalan (@MNightShyamalan) February 27, 2017 The shocking twist, itself worthy of an award, capped off a slightly disappointing night for La La Land , which also failed to pick up many of the technical awards it was expected to, though the film did pick up Best Director, Best Actress and Cinematography.\nMoonlight meanwhile, in addition to the night's biggest award, ensnared Best Supporting actor thanks to Mahershala Ali along with the Original Screenplay prize.Mahershala Ali along with the Original Screenplay prize.\nHacksaw Ridge picked up an unexpected number of awards and the critically-panned Suicide Squad is now an Oscar-winning film (if just for Hairstyling and Make-up).\nMore to follow as the situation unfolds.
