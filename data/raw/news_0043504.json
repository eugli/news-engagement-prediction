  \nThe fifth round has not disappointed, with the magic of the FA Cup well and truly alive. \nNon-League Lincoln continued their giant-killing acts as Sean Raggett's late goal earned them a shock win at Premier League Burnley. \nThe Clarets were not the only top-flight side to be sent packing. \nLeicester's season took another turn for the worse as they were dumped out by League One Millwall, while Manchester City were held by Huddersfield. \nThere were no such problems for Chelsea, who beat Wolves 2-0 on Saturday , and Tottenham, after Mauricio Pochettino's men won 3-0 at Fulham. \nHere are 10 things we learned: Lincoln celebrate their win in the changing room over Burnley (Photo: Jan Kruger) 1. Diego wins the battle of the Costas \nIn the duel of Wolves' record £13 million signing and Chelsea's incendiary top scorer, it was Diego Costa who just about came out on top. \nWhen the Premier League leaders were struggling to get the gearbox out of neutral for 45 minutes, their warrior centre forward was one of the few in blue shirts who put himself about until Chelsea finally got hold of the game after an hour. \nHe does not save his snarling, combustible persona for top-flight defenders – he had a running battle with Wolves skipper Danny Batth. \nAnd he deserved his 89th minute goal, devoured with customary aplomb, to make the tie safe. \nHelder Costa, on the other hand, made less headway as the game wore on – although you can see why he has already scored nine goals this season and he will become a crowd pleaser in the Black Country.

Barton lucky not to see red \nThat approach eventually provoked Burnley, and Joey Barton was lucky not to see red. \nHe should have been booked for an outrageous piece of simulation when he ducked under the pointing arm of Mathew Rhead, had the top of his head faintly brushed accidentally, and then went down in instalments. \nSoon after he was booked for pushing Terry Hawkridge in the face, and that should have seen him march.

Ranieri shows where his priorities lie \nClaudio Ranieri failed to learn the lessons of the last round as his gamble of making wholesale changes backfired. \nHe made 10 changes to his side, with Demarai Gray the only survivor from the side that were well-beaten at Swansea last week. \nThey looked set to earn a replay until Shaun Cummings struck right at the death. \nOnce the dust settles Leicester might not be too disappointed at being knocked out though with Premier League survival their big priority now and the small matter of a Champions League last-16 tie against Sevilla coming up on Wednesday.

Jose's super-subs do the trick \nThe last thing Mourinho or United wanted was a replay, given their already congested fixture programme, fighting on four fronts. \nThe United boss picked a strong enough side but had insurance on the bench in the form or Paul Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the two combining to plunder the decisive winner, a sumptuous ball over the top from the former and an exquisite first-time finish from the latter, to avoid a dreaded relay. (Photo: REUTERS) 5. Tottenham don't lose in England when Kane scores \nSpurs skipper Harry Kane has now scored 10 in 10 and the North London club have only lost once when he has found the net this season – the 2-1 defeat at Monaco back in November. \nHe was subbed off to huge applause after 75 minutes. \nTottenham will likely go back into the transfer market for another striker this summer but he will have to play second billing to the local hero. (Photo: REUTERS) 6. Kompany's injury woes continue \nVincent Kompany's injury jinx struck again . Kompany was in the squad and expected to make his first start since the victory over Crystal Palace in the last round before pulling out at the last minute injured. \nThe injury is the latest in a long line of setbacks for the City skipper, who has made just five starts this season. \nThere is growing uncertainty over Kompany's long-term future at the Etihad and he could be pushed out in the summer with Pep Guardiola targeting Virgil van Dijk. \nVan Dijk is the sort of ball-playing centre-half Guardiola loves, rather than the physical, injury-prone Kompany. (Photo: Reuters) 7. Rudy Gestede gets his first Boro goal \nAitor Karanka wants him to pressure Alvaro Negredo for the starting striker berth, and he's doing just that. \nHe scored a lovely overhead kick after Fabio's cross caused confusion in the visiting defence. \nIt was an improvised goal and Negredo, on the bench, will have taken not that more is needed from him in the league in the coming weeks. \nIndeed Negredo came on late, and helped make the winner. That's the sort of competition for places Boro need. (Photo: Getty Images Europe) 8. Rashford takes his chance \nRashford has found starts hard to come by this season under Mourinho, after coming from nowhere last season to emerge as United's main striker under Louis van Gaal. \nBut here, on a rare start a few days before the anniversary of his debut last term, Rashford reminded Mourinho of his enduring threat up front, keeping a cool head to round keeper Jason Steele to score United's opener, while constantly putting Blackburn defence on alert with his explosive pace and direct running. (Photo: REUTERS) 9. Dyche pays price for squad rotation \nSean Dyche rested six players, and you wonder if that was absolutely necessary. \nIt's not as if Burnley have a midweek game, and they really are probably pretty safe in the Premier League now, so they could concentrate on a cup run, and cap what has been a fine season with a little bit of FA Cup glory. \nInstead, they are a footnote in history, as their opponents took glory.
