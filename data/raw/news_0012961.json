The 1978 rugby tour of New Zealand was going well, but they weren't there to talk about football. \nThe night before an incident had profoundly shaken the group. \nOne of the players had been called to a Marist brother's room on the pretence of treating an injury from that day's game. \nThe coach tried to sexually assault the boy. He fled, told his closest friend, and word had spread quickly through the touring party. \nThe boys, aged between 16 and 18, called a meeting. At its end they passed a resolution: the coach was to be banned from the change room, when the team returned to Canberra, the brother was to leave the school and the Marists were called on to guarantee that he would never teach again. The Catholic Church has released \"grim\" data revealing 7 per cent of Australian priests, working between 1950 and 2009, have been accused of child sex crimes. \nThe shocking incident caused one 17-year-old to question a commitment. At school's end he had resolved to leave for Sydney, to train as a priest. \nSo he sought the counsel of another brother travelling with the group, a popular man who ran a movie club at the school. \nWhen the boy confided his fears about the act of a man who professed to be a model of faith he got an unexpected response. \nThe brother's face darkened with fury: why would your vocation be affected by the actions of one man? The boy felt ashamed of his doubts. \nEarly the next year the Canberra boy joined seven others at a novitiate in Toongabbie in Sydney's west. \nOne, John, was a deeply troubled young man. He was a brilliant student but painfully thin and desperately shy, with an array of behavioural quirks that made him very hard to live with. \nJohn would sit alone in the common room late at night listening to his Bob Dylan records, smoking, talking to himself and rocking. \nOne evening the Canberra boy knocked on John's door to bum a smoke. There was no answer so he opened the door a fraction, hoping to see a cigarette packet on the desk in the tiny cell. \nInstead there was a candle on the table and in front of it was a note that read: \n\"Why kill myself slowly, do it now.\" \nThe priests and students were roused. They searched the grounds. The police were called. John couldn't be found, so the community gathered in the chapel to pray for his safe return. \nHe came back three days later but, within a month, left the seminary forever.
