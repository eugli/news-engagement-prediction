It was recently listed for $6 million. ﻿ \nThe couple saw San Souci as the perfect respite from Garcia's busy touring and recording schedule. They raised their three daughters there and kept a number of pets, including a horse and a domesticated crow. \nMarin County is one of the richest (per capita income) areas in the United States. Other notable residents include George Lucas, Sean Penn and the late Robin Williams. Ad Feedback SOCALMLS \nAlthough it’s been renovated and updated since the legendary Grateful Dead frontman lived there, his spirit, and a few relics, remain. SOCALMLS \nThe home has everything a luxury home buyer desires, including open living spaces with vaulted ceilings and walls made of reclaimed wood. SOCALMLS \nGarcia and his wife paid US$20,000 for the property in 1971, the equivalent of about NZ$164,000 today. SOCALMLS \nThe open kitchen has been updated with Viking and Miele appliances. SOCALMLS \nThe main house has three bedrooms, including this master suite. SOCALMLS \nThe master bedroom opens out to a sun-drenched deck. SOCALMLS \nPerhaps this tile is an echo of the tie-dyed t-shirts favoured by \"Deadheads\"? SOCALMLS \nAcross the courtyard is a guest apartment, shown here, and a separate guest cottage. SOCALMLS \nThe guest cottage is the highest point of the property and features a clever sleeping loft that was once Garcia’s studio. SOCALMLS \nMany of the Grateful Dead's best-known songs were composed in this loft. SOCALMLS \nGarcia entertained and jammed with other musical luminaries at Sans Souci, including Bob Dylan and John Lennon. SOCALMLS \nSans Souci was a bit more rustic and bucolic in the ’70s, according to listing agent Jon DiRienzo of Paragon Real Estate Group Marin. SOCALMLS \nOutside there’s a black-bottom pool and spa. SOCALMLS \nAlong with this fireplace, there's a fully-equipped outdoor kitchen kitchen with a built-in grill and stove. SOCALMLS \nLocated in Marin County, the home offers views from Bolinas peninsula in the north to San Francisco in the south. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:50:34.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
