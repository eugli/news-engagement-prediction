I think there are a lot of people that think that.\" \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

Stakes are obviously bigger now than they have ever been involved with. \n\"It will be interesting to see how they respond. I hope they can just take care of the process and go out and just do what we talked about. \nThe Vols have improved defensively, as their coach said they would, giving up 73.5 points per game this season after giving up 75.2 per game in 2015-16. \n\"We are a better overall defensive team,\" Barnes said, \"even though we are not consistent enough.\" \nKevin Punter led Tennessee in scoring last season at 22.2 points per game, a full 10 points better per night than Armani Moore , second highest on the team at 12.2. Senior guard Robert Hubbs leads the current Vols at 14.3 points per game, but freshman forward Grant Williams is closing in at 12.8. \n\"Where we were different a year ago is that we can score inside,\" Barnes said of this team, which works through Hubbs, Williams and sophomore forward Admiral Schofield (8.1 points per game) to play inside-out basketball. \"We really struggled to score there (last season).\" \nSeven different players on this deeper roster of Vols have led the team in scoring in games this season. For what's believed to be the first time in program history, four different freshmen recorded 20 or more points in a game through the first 10 games on schedule. Six players in total have scored 20 or more in a game. \n\"We have more guys that can have big nights for us,\" Barnes said. \"Last year we had a couple of guys that did that, but I think consistently we have more guys that can do that now.\" \nHow this team will ultimately be judged, though, is how it finishes the season. Whether it finds a way to defy odds and earn a berth in the NCAA Tournament, has to settle for an NIT bid or, like last season, has no postseason at all after the SEC Tournament in Nashville. \n\"We have to continue to get better,\" Barnes said, \"but we are better than we were a year ago.\" \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
