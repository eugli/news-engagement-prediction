Like their breakthrough “ Seasons (Waiting on You) ,” it’s an expression of pure hunger, juxtaposing artificial sounds—those Spandau Ballet keyboards and studio-perfect drums—against raw human emotion. Herring’s voice remains their greatest instrument, and he continues to milk it for every ounce of drama. “What’s a song without you, when every song I write is about you?” he sings with collar-clenching ardor, panicked by the possibility of losing a relationship that’s likely already dead. Then he goes in for the growl: “I can’t hold myself without you!” As always there’s an element of fantasy at play. Contemporary music doesn’t sound like this, and the world certainly doesn’t feel like this, yet Future Islands make this style of romance-swept new wave sound as alluring and empowering as ever.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:00:13.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
