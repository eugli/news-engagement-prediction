Key points: Depp sues management group alleging mismanagement of earnings The Management Group managed Depp's funds from 1999-2016 Group's lawsuit alleges Depp ignored advice \nThe countersuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by The Management Group comes about two weeks after Depp sued the company, alleging it grossly mismanaged his earnings. \nThe lawsuit said Depp paid more than $US75 million to buy and maintain 14 homes, including a French chateau and a chain of islands in the Bahamas. \nDepp also spent heavily to buy a 150-foot yacht, fly on private jets and cultivate collections of fine art and Hollywood memorabilia requiring 12 storage facilities to maintain, the lawsuit said. \nThe lawsuit said Depp was repeatedly warned by the company that his spending was out of control, but ignored his former advisers' advice to control his spending. \n\"Depp, and Depp alone, is fully responsible for any financial turmoil he finds himself in today,\" the lawsuit stated. \nDepp sued The Management Group on January 13, seeking more than $US25 million he contends was mismanaged. \nHis lawsuit also alleged the company failed to file Depp's taxes on time, costing him $US5.7 million in penalties. \nBut the countersuit said Depp's tax returns were always filed on time and taxes were paid when the star had money available to pay them. \nThe company handled his finances from 1999 until early 2016, an especially lucrative period in the actor's career. \nDuring that time Depp launched the blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and other big-budget releases, including Alice in Wonderland and the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. \nDepp's attorneys did not immediately respond to an email and phone messages seeking comment. \nThe countersuit seeks a judge's ruling that Depp is to blame for his financial troubles, and $US560,000 in fees The Management Group said it is owed. \nThe money being sought comes on top of $US4.2 million the firm announced on January 13 that it was seeking from Depp for repayment of a loan it said it made to the actor. \nDepp is not the first blockbuster star to take his former managers to court alleging mismanagement. \nNicolas Cage sued his former business manager seeking $US20 million for alleged mismanagement in 2009 and the manager in a countersuit cited the actor's spending for his financial troubles. \nThe case was resolved before trial. \nAP First posted February 01, 2017 13:19:06 Top Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:26:58.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
