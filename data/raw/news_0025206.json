Rana , 44, became an active member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party-Nepal (RPP-N) recently, and she is likely to contest the election for the central council which, if she wins, would make her a delegate to the party’s national convention. \nHer father, Pashupati Shumsher Rana, is one of the three contestants for party chairmanship. “In the meantime, she will be seeking permission from the UN agency in Delhi that she works for, to get actively involved in politics,” an RPP-N source told The Sunday Express. \nDevyani left Nepal within a week of the massacre on June 1, 2001, in which Crown Prince Dipendra, the man who wanted to marry her, allegedly shot nine members of the royal family, including his parents — King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya — allegedly over the latter’s opposition to the match.
