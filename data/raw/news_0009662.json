(Photo: Ben Moffat/The Republic) \nArizonans on Saturday reacted with a mixture of joy, dismay and fear to news that a federal court judge Friday night had halted President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban . Advocates on both sides vowed to continue to fight as the issue advances through the courts.\nFamily worries Jany Deng came to Arizona from Sudan when he was 16. He said despite the court ruling blocking President Donald Trump's travel ban, he is still worried about his family.   (Photo: The Republic) \nJany Deng was still sleeping when he heard his phone. It was a text, just a few words from a friend, telling him a judge had lifted a ban on travel to the U.S.\nDeng was 16 in 1995 when he escaped war from his home country of what is now South Sudan. A Phoenix family sponsored the teenager’s refugee application. Arizona families accepted thousands of “Lost Boys,” the name given to the displaced South Sudanese children who fled their villages amid war.\nRELATED: Arizona 'Lost Boy' gives back, and you can see it \nLately, Deng’s life has revolved around watching the news about refugees and immigrants.\nTrump on Jan. 27 signed the executive order, which sought to block people from seven majority-Muslim countries, including Sudan, from entering the United States for a 120-day period. Friday night, U.S. District Senior Judge James Robart of Seattle issued a nationwide restraining order blocking the order.\nRELATED: Trump's immigration ban: How we ended up back where we were 9 days ago ... for now \nDeng said he hopes the judge's order is a sign that things will change.\n“You have to recognize something good happened and you have to celebrate that,” he said. “It’s a positive for those people who are stuck, who are worried about what will happen to them.”\nDeng is still worried. He spoke by phone with his brother early Saturday. They talked about his brother’s children, the nephews and nieces Deng has been trying to bring to safety in Arizona.\n“He told me, ‘We were just hoping for them to go with you, but now, because of what your president is doing, it’s just destroying everybody’s hope all over the world,’ ” Deng said.\nDeng became an American citizen in 2005. He counts the day among his proudest moments. He is struggling to understand the shift in some Americans’ attitudes toward refugees.\n“America, that’s the country everybody looks up to, now people are losing hope,” he said. “It’s very sad. We should be welcoming them, we should be saying, ‘Let’s save your life.' ”\nSome lawmakers disappointed Rep. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, said he supported Trump's executive order as a means of protection and said the temporary halt of visitors from select countries would have given lawmakers the opportunity to examine the federal vetting process. He said he was disappointed and worried about the court ruling.\n\"The order was meant to protect our country from improperly vetted refugees,\" he said. \"If the (court) order stands, the country will be less safe. ... If we are to do anything we should err on the side of safety.\"\nSen. Steve Smith, R-Maricopa, said he supported Trump's executive order as a means of protection for U.S. citizens. He said it aimed to properly vet travelers and denied it was a \"ban on Muslims.\" He said he disagreed with attempts to delay or abolish it.\n\"I think (the executive order) means to protect the people of our country,\" Smith said. \"Ensuring safety is my job and the job of any other elected official.\"\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer released a statement saying the Department of Justice would appeal the decision as the president aimed to \"protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people.\"\nSteve Kilar, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, said in a written statement to The Arizona Republic that the Washington ruling is merely one step in the long process.\n\"The courts are rightly acting as a check on the president and his unconstitutional ban targeting Muslims. We've now seen several members of the independent federal judiciary put a temporary halt on portions of the executive order, relieving many people from unfair and unnecessary travel restrictions,\" Kilar said. \"There will be more litigation to come before this ban is permanently reversed, including from the ACLU, but for right now we're glad that the chaos and confusion caused by this ill-conceived and unlawful order is easing.\"\nDemonstrators pleased Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Immigration ban protested at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

She criticized Trump's order and said that though some freedoms are compromised for the sake of safety, the United States should never shut its doors to refugees or immigrants.\n\"People are being profiled and are being separated from their families. We do not profile based on religion and that's what this order does,\" she said.\nShe said she remains cautiously optimistic about the recent development.\n\"Given Trump's response to the ruling, it shows that it's not over yet,\" she said.\nSattler had planned another Sky Harbor rally for Saturday but canceled it due to the unpredictable nature of the litigation. She said it was important to take time analyze the situation.\nUsman Karriem, chairman of the Islamic Community Center of Tempe, said the court ruling shows that demonstrations like one he helped organize Friday succeeded in sending the message that the Trump administration actions are \"aggressive, uncivil and unconstitutional.\"\n\"With all the rhetoric going on, the vile and vitriol, I really want people to look back at founding fathers. One of the things it says in the Constitution is, 'We the people.' It doesn't say we the Christians, we the Muslims, the Jews or atheists,\" Karriem said. \"Inclusiveness is what this country is built on. That's what we're here for and that's what we're fighting for.\"\nKarriem said he was pleased that action is being taken to prevent the administration from doing what it desires. He said many in the community are ready to defend themselves against injustice and pointed attacks.\n\"Look at your own ancestors and see how they were challenged to get into this country. See how they were persecuted in their own countries and sought safer places to grow and raise their families,\" he said. \"This is the new civil rights movement and we have to come back again together to object these actions.\"\nLawyers remain available Ruben L. Reyes takes a selfie with other lawyers at Terminal 4 in Sky Harbor International Airport on Saturday, Feb. 4, 2017.   (Photo: Ruben L. Reyes) \nA group of lawyers joined together at about 5:30 p.m. Saturday to sit in Sky Harbor's Terminal 4 waiting for International flights to come in. They said they were there just in case anyone needed help or wanted to get involved.\n\"You can take a defensive drive class and your parents can teach you how to drive but you still buy the insurance because you never know,\"said Ruben L. Reyes with the Arizona Chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \"We're the insurance. We are making sure that if something does happen that they will be there.\"\nEven with the court order halting the ban, Reyes said they plan to have lawyers at the airport daily over the next week or so. He said if people don't \"witness, document and track the abuses\" then there can be no protection of liberties.\nHe said no one on Saturday reported a detained family member or friend, but said the lawyers got a lot of weird looks and high-fives. The group stayed until 9 p.m.\n\"We encourage people to get active,\" Reyes said. \"If they feel there is something they should do, then they should do it.\"\nOther residents weigh in Diane Spirk, 78, of Scottsdale said she is most concerned about illegal immigration but had been following Trump's travel ban. She said she supported setting additional limits on refugees who enter the country, but she did not think it should apply to individuals with U.S. visas. She said she agreed with the judge's ruling.\n\"I think the immigrants who have visas should be able to get in, but I think that definitely we kind of have to watch who we do let in,\" Spirk said.\nHer husband, Donald, agreed, saying, \"(Immigration) should be well organized and legal.\"\nTatè Walker, 33, of Phoenix said she supports the decision to delay Trump's executive order.\n\"I think it’s a good example of actual law and policy coming through versus conjecture or alternative facts,\" she said. \"I hope we see more of this in the future.\"\nJane Armour, 64, of Phoenix said she was appalled with Trump's ruling and was pleased to see that a judge had chosen to temporarily suspend the ban.\n\"(The executive order) was just a bad move,\" Armour said, giving the court ruling a thumbs-up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:32:28.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
