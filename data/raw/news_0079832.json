Picture: The Sun. Source: Supplied \nShe said: “I’m very open-minded about sex and public places — I love the thrill you may get caught.\n“But obviously I never thought we’d get caught like this and end up all over the internet.”\nBuilder Craig, 31, said: “After ordering the pizza we talked about all the places we’d had sex with each other.\n“Our top five include a bus, a van, a hotel, swimming pool and a field. We wanted to see if we could top it.\n“We got a bit frisky and one thing led to another. Domino’s is definitely now our number one — going to be hard to top it.”\nDaniella kneels in front of Craig at the counter. Picture: The Sun. Source: Supplied \nThe couple had spent the weekend drinking in Leeds celebrating Craig’s birthday when they got the train to Scarborough on Saturday evening.\nThe pair, from Bridlington, East Yorks, booked into a local pub but felt peckish so headed across the road to Domino’s.\nDaniella added: “We laughed as we walked home. We’ve done it all over the place but never anywhere that risky — never with people that close before.\n“We got back to the hotel and continued where we left off.\n“We woke up the next morning and our friends told us about the CCTV- we just laughed about it going viral.\n“That’s just the type of thing that happens to us.”\nThe couple, who started dating three-and-a-half months ago after meeting in the pub where Daniella works, say they won’t stop.\nDaniella added: “Everybody we know has had sex in risky places. It’s just one of them things that people do.\n“Unfortunately for us it ended up on the internet.\n“We’re open minded. We won’t do it in Domino’s again. Maybe Pizza Hut.\n“So long as you’re not hurting anyone else I don’t see what the problem is.\n“You can’t please everyone — but at least Craig is happy.”\nThe couple refused to blame the Domino’s staff member who posted the CCTV on Twitter and said they would have done the same.\nBut they now fear arrest from the cops for public indecency. Pals have supported them on Facebook but their family remain tight-lipped.\nThe pair plan to celebrate Craig’s 31st birthday. Craig added: “We’re going for an Indian.”\nDaniella advised critics online: “Rule number 1, never waste ya boyfriend’s b***r and always opt for stuffed crust.”\nAsked about the incident, a spokesman for the Domino’s shop said:\n“We can’t comment on something like that — it’s a no comment from us.”\nThis article originally appeared on The Sun .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:51:53.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
