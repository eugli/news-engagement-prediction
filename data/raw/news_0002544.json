A destination for devotees and novices alike to read about, learn about, and share their appreciation for beer and celebrate the culture around it. The site is being launched in partnership with ZX Ventures, AB InBev’s incubator and venture capital fund that focuses on increasing awareness and excitement around beer and brewing culture. \nOctober will offer a wide range of content, including beer ratings and in-depth crossover features, such as “ What Rolling Rock and The Deer Hunter Can Teach Us About Product Placement in Movies .” October will be a resource for beer drinkers much in the same way that Pitchfork is for music lovers, and will use beer as the lens with which it approaches all elements of beer culture and beyond. \nThe site will exist as an independent editorial property, overseen by Pitchfork’s creative studio and in collaboration with Michael Kiser of Good Beer Hunting , Eno Sarris of BeerGraphs , and many other leading voices. October’s Executive Editor Kiser and his own GBH previously won SAVEUR ’s 2016 and 2013 Drinks Website of the Year, Imbibe Magazine ’s “people to watch in 2016,” and three North American Guild of Beer Writers awards among the team. \n“Good Beer Hunting has always had a unique voice in the beer industry with an inside-out perspective,” said Kiser. “With October, we have an opportunity to tell an even broader story about beer, while having fun with an audience that has experienced the craft beer explosion first-hand.” \nFollow October on social media at @ReadOctober on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram . And look out for October videos, podcasts, and events.
