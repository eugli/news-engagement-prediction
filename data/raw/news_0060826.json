It’s a shrewd move that puts the 3-time MVP and 5-time NBA champion in prime position to shape the look of one of basketball’s most enduring, historic, and successful franchises. Already, Johnson has been making moves, trading Lakers shooting guard Lou Williams to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Corey Brewer and an unprotected first-round draft pick in 2017. Most of us have transitioned into new leadership at the workplace before, so we’re dropping some Men’s Health advice on how to impress your new (mega-mogul, world-famous) boss. \n1. Research your history \nPrivacy Policy | About Us \nJohnson loves leveraging the connections he built up over his playing days, and as a result basketball greats like James Worthy and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar still orbit the Lakers organization. A new executive or athlete entering the Lakers’ system would do well to study up on the franchise’s 16 championships, or the president’s 9 first-team all-NBA honors. \n2. Take Initiative \nThe Lakers have a young squad. They have a first-year coach in Luke Walton and they have nine players with less than five years NBA experience. It’ll be important for a new arrival to come in and set the tone with some assertive veteran leadership. Johnson will be looking for players who can step in and make an immediate impact on the young homegrown talent. \n3. Know When To Be A Suck-Up \nListen, flattery isn’t the worst thing in the world, especially when it comes to a guy like Johnson, with his world-class smile and deep rolodex of powerful friends. In addition to hiring Magic, Los Angeles has fired GM Mitch Kupchak and VP of Basketball Operations Jim Buss. There are openings at the top. Put yourself in position to rise.
