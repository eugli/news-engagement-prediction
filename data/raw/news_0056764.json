Greg Abbott in Austin requesting that he meet with some of them who have used medical marijuana to treat service-related conditions like PTSD, traumatic brain injury or chronic pain. \nThe group will hold a new conference at 10:30 a.m. in front of the Vietnam Veterans monument at the state capitol. \nThe same letter was sent last year to Gov. Abbott's office but organizers said they received no word whether a meeting would happen. \nThis time, organizers said they will add the signatures of more than 1,400 Texas veterans in a bid to build support for legislation allowing the use of medical marijuana as a \"safer alternative\" to prescription drugs.
