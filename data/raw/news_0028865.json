Bouncer Howard Young ensured his customers were safe before racing to confront the attacker (Photo: Peter Bolter) \n“He attacked a couple of people and then he went to his vehicle,” Howard said. \nThey then tried to stop the thug driving off. \n“My colleague opened the door of the van and I said ‘Get the keys, get the keys.’ \n“But he put his foot down and swerved out to the right.\" \nHoward was at the side of the van. Burgess swings the saw at one man in the melee (Photo: WALES NEWS SERVICE) \n“The driver’s door was open so it hit me,” he said. \n“I stayed on my feet but I travelled backward. It happened so quickly, it was a split second. \n“My concern was trying to stop him leaving and getting him out of the vehicle. \n“It could have been much worse.” Burgess was handed a 16-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months (Photo: WALES NEWS SERVICE) \nBurgess went on the rampage in Merthyr Road, Cardiff, last November 6 after spending the day of the Wales vs Australia autumn international drinking in the city centre. \nThe 35-year-old, from Washford Avenue, Llanrumney, then drove to Miss Jones, where he parked on double yellow lines. \nHe couldn’t get in because it was closing – so he threatened to “slash” and “stab” people. Burgess was swinging wildly with the 18-inch saw (Photo: WALES NEWS SERVICE) \nOne man suffered a wound to his arm that needed four stitches. His girlfriend was left with cut hands after trying to stop the assault. \n“All we could think of was to protect who we could and get the saw off him,” Howard said. \nA CCTV camera captured the incident that showed Burgess brandishing the weapon. Customers fled as Burgess came close to the bar (Photo: WALES NEWS SERVICE) \nHe denied dangerous driving after being arrested. \nA breath test showed he had 61 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath – the limit is 35.

The attack happened outside the Miss Jones Bar and Grill in Whitchurch, Cardiff (Photo: South Wales Echo) \nCardiff Crown Court heard Burgess had previous convictions for drink-driving, drunk and disorderly behaviour, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. \nHe was given a 16-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, after admitting drink-driving and making threats with an offensive weapon.

Burgess was over the drink drive limit (Photo: WALES NEWS SERVICE) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T11:50:23.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
