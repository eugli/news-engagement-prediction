Now, he’s detailed the upcoming novel. It’s called The Whiz Mob and the Grenadine Kid , and it’s out October 24. It’s illustrated by his wife Carson Ellis . Publishers Weekly previously described it as a “middle grade novel about an impressionable young American who falls in with a ragtag group of pickpockets in 1961 France.” Meloy and Ellis worked together on the fantasy novel series, Wildwood Chronicles . \nThe Whiz Mob and the Grenadine Kid will follow the previously announced The Golden Thread , a picture book biography about the late Pete Seeger . (Ellis also illustrated that book.) The Golden Thread is scheduled to arrive this summer via Balzer + Bray . FOLKS! Feast yr eyes on the cover for my new book, my 1st collab w/ @cfellis since #wildwood ! THE WHIZ MOB AND THE GRENADINE KID.
