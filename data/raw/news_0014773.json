The star All Black has rejected a megabucks move to France. Today, he revealed why. \nAll Black fullback and vice-captain Ben Smith has re-signed with New Zealand Rugby through to 2020 after resisting a lucrative move overseas. \nSmith's plans after the upcoming British and Irish Lions series had been the subject of intense speculation particularly after it was suggested he was considering a move to French club Pau, where he would reunite with fellow World Cup winner Conrad Smith. GETTY IMAGES \nBen Smith has re-signed with New Zealand Rugby through to 2020. \nThe 30-year-old had remained silent on his future over the off-season, until Tuesday afternoon, when an Instagram post revealed a decision was imminent. \nPhotographed on a blue and gold picnic blanket, a smiling Smith asked the question: \"Speights or Champagne?\" with a hand on a bottle of each. \nREAD MORE: A photo posted by Ben Smith (@bensmith1100) on Feb 6, 2017 at 5:17pm PST \nHe revealed his answer at Forsyth Barr Stadium about two hours later when toasting his decision with a bottle of Otago's finest. IAIN MCGREGOR/FAIRFAXNZ \nSpeights or Champagne? Ben Smith opts for beer and a new deal to keep him in New Zealand until 2020. \n\"It's been an interesting few months as we have worked through what was best for my family and career over the next few years. In the end we are happy with our decision to stay in New Zealand,\" Smith said via a statement released by NZR. Ad Feedback \n\"Obviously, the All Blacks, the Highlanders and Otago are three teams that I really enjoy playing for, and I'm pretty excited about a few of the opportunities and challenges we'll have over the next few seasons.\" \nThe future of Smith and fullback rival Israel Dagg have been a focus since first five-eighth Aaron Cruden confirmed last month he had signed a $3.6 million deal to join French club Montpellier after his NZR deal expires this season. \nHowever the backline linchpin, who has played 60 tests for the All Blacks since debuting against Italy in Milan in 2009, has opted to stay, pleasing All Black coach Steve Hansen. \n\"To have the most consistent player in world rugby re-signing is great news for New Zealand rugby and a real credit to our game. \n\"It's a real confidence booster for us to keep a player of this calibre in our country and we now look forward with excitement knowing that our vice-captain is going to be with us through to 2020. GETTY IMAGES \nBen Smith has resisted the temptation to head to French club Pau and play alongside Conrad Smith at the end of this season. \n\"Obviously, it's taken a wee while to reach an agreement but good things take time,\" Hansen said. \nHighlanders head coach Tony Brown echoed Hansen's sentiments as he prepares for his first campaign at the helm of the 2015 Super Rugby champions. \n\"It's fantastic news that 'Bender' has decided to stay. \n\"I know these decisions are never easy, but now that it's done, we are looking forward to having him back leading the side again (as co-captain). \n\"As a coach you can't ask for much more from your players than he provides us week after week, but more than being the consummate professional and a great rugby player, he's just an outstanding Highlander Man.\" \nAttention now turns to Dagg given the 28-year-old, 61-test veteran , has also mentioned as a possible target for Toulon and Irish club Leinster. \nShould Dagg opt to stay he faces a renewed challenge for a place in the All Blacks back three from Nehe Milner-Skudder - who re-signed through to 2019 on January 25. \nMilner-Skudder was a stand out at the 2015 World Cup in the first choice back three comprising Smith and Julian Savea while Dagg missed the squad because Beauden Barrett and Milner-Skudder could also cover fullback if Smith suffered an injury at the tournament. \nDagg subsequently resurrected his All Black career after Milner-Skudder sustained a season-ending shoulder injury early in last year's Super Rugby competition. \nSmith was initially linked with Irish club Munster although rumours that private investors were being sought to bankroll the deal were scotched because the club that famously beat the All Blacks in 1978 supposedly had a policy of developing or signing players eligible to play for Ireland. \nMunster distanced itself from Smith shortly before Christmas and in the New Year Pau emerged as a possible destination according to Midi Olympique while the Highlanders star quietly focused on preparing for the arrival of his second child in March. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:03:04.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
