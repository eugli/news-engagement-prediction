Women’s March releases details of Day Without a Woman (snicker) Posted at 10:30 am on February 27, 2017 by Sam J. \nEver since the Women’s March announced their next big event, “Day Without a Woman,” people have been asking what they’re supposed to do on this specific day. \nLuckily the event organizers finally released the details … and yeah, they are less than inspiring. 1. Women take the day off, from paid & unpaid labor2. Avoid shopping for one day3. Wear RED in solidarity https://t.co/fOW1CkULJy \n— Women's March (@womensmarch) February 26, 2017 \nWomen take the day off work — whether you are paid or unpaid. (ROFL) Refrain from shopping for the day — or if you must shop, choose small, women- and minority-owned businesses. (don’t buy clothes from evil white women though) Wear red in solidarity with those participating in and supporting the strike. (even though it will totally clash with your pink vagina hat) \n\nTwitter of course had input and ideas of its own: 4. Pink slip on Tuesday5. Burn pussy hat on Wednesday \n— The 57th State ℅EF™ (@EF517_V2) February 26, 2017 \nHad to take it a little further right? This is all so confusing…. so pink pussy hats are out…. so red pussy hats now…or big boob hats? 🤣 @EF517_V2 @womensmarch @bustle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:45:27.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
