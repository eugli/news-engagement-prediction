Proving himself a key part of Antonio Conte's Chelsea by having the flexibility to become part of a back three. People preferring to call him 'Dave' rather try to pronounce his surname. \nBut being the man who plays more passes than anyone else in the Premier League? Even the biggest Chelsea fan might be a little surprised to hear that the 27 year-old was the top-flight's top pass master last weekend. \nNot Paul Pogba, David Silva or Mesut Ozil. The Chelsea defender passed the ball more frequently than any other Premier League player. \"Good job, Dave\" (Photo: Darren Walsh) \nThe stats - courtesy of EA Sports - show that 'Dave' completed 103 passes in the 1-1 draw against Burnley. He didn't attempt 103 passes. He played 103 successful passes. \nIn fact, he was the only player to reach three figures. Most completed passes \nNo doubt many of you will currently be furiously screaming at your screen/phone, yelling about the fact that defenders just play more passes because they are in their own half, knocking the ball from side to side. \nIf you are one of those people, prepare to be silenced by this table: Most completed passes \nAzplicueta played 53 successful passes in the opposition half at Turf Moor, meaning he completed more attacking passes than anyone else this weekend. \nNo wonder they love him at Stamford Bridge… \nData Courtesy of EA SPORTS, the Lead Partner of the Premier League.
