The virtual currency is up 10 days in a row as we noted previously t hat the Chinese have discovered a workaround for the PBOC's crackdown on Bitcoin exchanges. \nRecord highs in USD terms... (not yet record highs in Yuan terms) \n\nAs we noted previously , China’s central bank has stepped up oversight of bitcoin exchanges this year, leading major trading platforms to impose halts on withdrawals and other checks to appease the regulator. But, as Quartz reports, Chinese traders aren’t playing along—they are apparently flocking to peer-to-peer marketplaces to continue buying and selling bitcoin. \nAs Yuan trading on bitcoin exchanges has plummeted... \nQuartz notes that one of the longest established peer-to-peer marketplaces is LocalBitcoins, which acts as a kind of directory for buyers and sellers to find each other.
