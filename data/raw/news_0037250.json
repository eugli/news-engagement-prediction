Regardless if the food is actually good (or even edible), I will tell whoever cooked it that it is absolutely delicious. \nAnd so should you, unless you want to be attacked over a plate of “just OK” pasta. \nJason Martin was eating lunch made by his girlfriend Jodi Ecklund when she asked him how he liked her spaghetti. He replied it was “OK.” \n“OK,” Jason?! JUST OK?! She slaves over a hot pot of boiling water for roughly eight minutes, unless you want it al dente, and the most you can say is “OK?!” \nJodi didn’t take this too well. So, she had a conversation with him asking him to be more appreciative of the hard work she does to make his life a little bit easier. \nJust kidding, she allegedly hit him in the head, threw his stuff into the parking lot, barricaded herself in their apartment and now faces six felony charges. As you do. \nPolice were called to their home in Merrimack, New Hampshire and Jodi treated them to leftover pasta an hours-long standoff. \nJodi allegedly threatened to kill any officer who tried to get inside. At one point, she allegedly told them, \nI got the safety off, you can come in now. \nPolice were forced to evacuate the apartment building while they attempted to reason with her. \nDenise Roy, the Merrimack police chief, told Union Leader , \nThere was more than one gun inside of the residence. \nJodi eventually surrendered and was taken to the hospital to treat self-inflicted injuries. During her arraignment hearing, she said, \nI have bipolar disorder. I’m not this monster. \nRegardless, she faces charges of criminal mischief, domestic violence simple assault, criminal threatening and reckless conduct. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
