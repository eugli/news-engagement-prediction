Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThis is the first picture of a university law student who fell down communal stairwell at the halls of residence at Plymouth University. \nPolice believe Luke Johns, 19, from Pontypridd in South Wales, suffered a fatal head injury in a tragic accident. \nFloral tributes have been laid to the popular student near the stairs at Discovery Heights Halls where he died - next to lit candles, a bottle of scrumpy and cans of cider. \nA note reads: \"We send our heartfelt sympathies to friends and family through this difficult time. Rest in peace. Love 805.\" \nFriend Summer Louise Otton said: \"This is the beginning of what people have been placing in Discovery in memory of the wonderful Luke Johns.\" \nThe tragedy happened at around 2:30am at the block of flats in Cobourg Street on Sunday. \nLuke is understood to have been at an \"after-party\" in the halls - with one witness last night describing panicked scenes, saying he was still \"haunted\" by what he saw. Tributes laid by the stairs near where Luke died at the halls of residence (Photo: Summer Louise Otton) \nAn investigation has been launched into the circumstances surrounding his death, the Plymouth Herald reports. \nMeanwhile numerous tributes have been posted online by \"devastated\", \"heartbroken\" and \"shocked\" friends - both in Devon and in Wales - who variously described Luke as \"the nicest\", \"a true friend\", \"such a good person\", \"a top guy\" and \"true legend\". \nThe football club Luke used to play for back home in Pontypridd, Lllantwit Fardre FC, posted a touching tribute online. \nIt said: \"Our condolences go out to the family and friends of our former player Luke 'Johnsy' Johns who tragically passed away this weekend. #oneofourown RIP\". \nA JustGiving page has been set up to raise money for the funeral of the friend they called \"Johnsy\" - which has raised £1,685 in less than 24 hours. \nIt describes Luke as \"a friend, a brother and a loving son\" adding: \"We are going to raise as much money as possible to help Luke's family really give him the send off he deserves.\" \nIt was set up by his best friend Sam Roberts, who posted online: \"A day and a life never to be forgotten, sleep tight big man. RIP Johnsy\". \nAnother friend, Max Galeozzie posted a photo in tribute online saying Luke was \"a great character who should never have been taken away from us this early\". \nHis friend Nathan Cousins said online that it had been \"both a pleasure and privilege to have got to spend so much time with such an amazing friend\". \nA local band called The Brocklebank paid tribute - sayingL \"Luke always supported us. From recording the EPto rehearsing for shows he was there. We've lost a brother.\" \nAn eye-witness of the horrific accident told The Plymouth Herald how there was panic in the aftermath of the tragic fall. \nThe man, who did not wished to be named, said a small group had attended a gathering at the block of halls after police shut down a large student party. \nThe witness said there were roughly 10 people in the flat at the time of the incident, some of whom did not even know anything had happened. \n\"My friend and I went down to the ground floor to leave to go to North Hill,\" he said. The tragedy happened at the Discovery Heights student apartment block at Plymouth University (Photo: Plymouth Herald) \n\"I opened the doors and saw a boy who was laid on the floor with severe head injuries. \n\"The paramedics had just arrived, and were screaming at us to get out. \n\"The security guards were guiding us up to the first floor to exit – we left immediately.\" \nThe eyewitness said the party was still in full swing after the accident, because many had no idea it had happened. \n\"It was an after-party to the one we had previously been at,\" he said. \n\"I recognised [the boy] from when we walked from North Road East but I don't know who he was with. \n\"Everyone was extremely drunk. An investigation has been launched into Luke's death (Photo: Plymouth Herald) \n\"We all go out and have fun with our friends. \n\"Nobody saw what happened, everyone was still upstairs at the party. \n\"When I arrived people were hanging out and drinking on the stairs.\" Read More Shocking moment nightclub ceiling collapses on screaming revellers - who hold it up to save themselves \nHe said he was \"haunted\" by what he witnessed and had been unable to sleep since the accident. \nThe eyewitness said: \"You see this kind of thing in films but I never expected this to happen on Saturday night. Luke is understood to have been at an \"after party\" in the block (Photo: Plymouth Herald) \n\"I haven't slept for two days. What I saw was absolutely horrific, even the paramedic's reaction is haunting me. \n\"What happened will stay with me forever, it's going to take me weeks to get over what I saw. \n\"It just goes to prove how precious life is.
