Rato, 67, had denied any wrongdoing.\nBankia was rescued in 2012 at huge public expense.\nAbout 200,000 small-scale savers - who had been persuaded to convert their savings into shares before Bankia's flotation in 2011 - lost their money.\nDuring the trial, Rato argued that the corporate credit cards were part of his pay package.\nAll the card purchases during that period were not declared to the tax authorities.\nRato resigned as head of Bankia shortly before its near-collapse in 2012.\nHe led the International Monetary Fund in 2004-07. Before that he served as Spain's economy minister.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/DB11/production/_94818065_b750e8e0-1187-479a-a243-529eec95e594.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-23T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:20:25.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
