Instagram \nThe happy couple told ET , \nWe are so overjoyed and excited for this baby! We absolutely LOVE kids and are so happy to finally be starting a family of our own. \nWow, three pregnant stars of “The Hills?” I wonder if Brody Jenner feels the way I do every time I look at Facebook and see all my high school friends married and pregnant? \nWahler said he’s excited to see his child speak their first word and walk for the first time. He said, \nAll of it is such an incredible journey and blessing we get to be a part of. \nHe couldn’t even contain his excitement in his Instagram post. \nAshley posted the same image to her Instagram with the caption, \nLOVE + MARRIAGE = BABY #werehavingababy #happiness #love #soexcited #august #2017thebestyearyet #babywahler. \nAshley and Jason, who were married in October of 2013, know what gender their baby is, but haven’t revealed it yet. They plan on throwing a gender reveal party for close family and friends in March. \nI suspect my invitation has been lost in the mail… \nThe couple are expecting their little one to arrive in August of this year. \nWay back on “Laguna Beach” and “The Hills,” Jason had a tumultuous relationship with Conrad, in which he frequently cheated on her and dealt with substance abuse issues. \nThankfully, they’re both in fully committed and happy relationships, and Jason is now sober. \nOn 10th anniversary special of “The Hills,” Conrad said, \nJason’s story has a happy ending. He is sober now and married and very happy. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
