Brian Vigneault died during a 24-hour charity video game marathon on Sunday. (Facebook) \nA cause and manner of his death are still pending, a Virginia Department of Health spokeswoman said. \nFellow gamers said that Vigneault was fond of smoking, and it was not immediately clear if his gaming marathon contributed to his death. \nThe 35-year-old father of three was broadcasting his exploits on the game World of Tanks via Twitch, an Amazon-owned social media platform that allows players to stream to their followers.

Maybe the saddest lines can not really be written, and the saddest thoughts can not really be uttered,” posted a group of fellow gamers called FAME. \nAn obituary for Vigneault said that he will be remembered at a memorial service on Tuesday. \nA moderator on his Twitch channel shared a GoFundMe page for his family that had raised more than $3,000 as of Wednesday afternoon.
