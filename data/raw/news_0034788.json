Africa crushed New Zealand by 78 runs in the one-off Twenty20 International in Auckland. cricket Updated: Feb 17, 2017 15:01 IST Reuters Imran Tahir picked up his maiden five-wicket haul as South Africa thrashed New Zealand by 78 runs in the one-off Twenty20 International in Auckland.(AFP) \nLegspinner Imran Tahir underlined why he is the world’s top-ranked bowler in limited overs cricket as he bamboozled New Zealand’s batsmen to help South Africa to a 78-run victory in their only Twenty20 match at Eden Park on Friday. \nTahir, who was on a hat-trick in his second over, had his figures ruined by successive sixes from Colin de Grandhomme but still finished with 5-24 in 3.5 overs, with the New Zealanders unable to pick his googly. \nThe 37-year-old did reap the benefits of a superb bowling performance by the rest of the team with Chris Morris, who was also denied a hat-trick, having figures of 2-10 in his opening three-over spell. \nAndile Phehlukwayo took three wickets, including the important wicket of New Zealand captain Kane Williamson, as the hosts crumbled to 107 in 14.5 overs while chasing South Africa’s 185-6. \nThe loss was New Zealand’s first at home this summer. \nBoth sides had said beforehand they felt just having one Twenty20 clash before the five-match one-day series did not have much meaning and more games should have been scheduled. \nThe South African top order, however, underlined how dangerous they would be in the one-day series with nearly all making telling contributions. \nWhile Quinton de Kock fell for a duck in the third over, Hashim Amla (62), captain Faf du Plessis (36), AB de Villiers (26) and JP Duminy (29) all scored quickly. \nAmla’s innings was particularly impressive as he played just pure cricket shots to hit nine boundaries and a six in his 43-ball innings. \nThe opener also combined with du Plessis in an 87-run partnership from 8.3 overs and the visitors looked well set to score in excess of 200 if the pair could stay at the crease. \nDe Grandhomme, however, dismissed both du Plessis and de Villiers to leave their side on 145-4 in the 16th over ensuring the all-rounders needed to push the innings on. \nOpening bowler Trent Boult finished with an impressive 2-8 from four overs. The first one-day international is at Seddon Park in Hamilton on Sunday. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:29.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
