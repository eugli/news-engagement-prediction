Clearly the accessory of the night will be the @ACLU ribbon, reminds me of the early days of AIDS AWARENESS & the red ribbon, #NeverForget \nSo far we’ve seen Lin Manuel Miranda (“Hamilton”) and Ruth Negga (“Loving”) with the light-blue fashion-political statements: Lin-Manuel Miranda and his mom #oscars pic.twitter.com/pvDJ4aGAkP \n— Sandy Cohen (@APSandy) February 26, 2017 Ruth Negga looks incredible — as does the ACLU ribbon she's wearing on her gown #Oscars pic.twitter.com/vJ3dEOW1rO \n— Jarett Wieselman (@JarettSays) February 26, 2017 Trending Michelle Malkin questions Twitter's priorities: #TrayvonMartin vs. #WorldTradeCenterBombing \nHopefully interviewers ask these pro-ACLU celebs what they think about the organization’s recent defense of disabled gun owners: How unpopular was this rule?
