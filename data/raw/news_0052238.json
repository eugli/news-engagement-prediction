Beyonce pulls out of Coachella 2017 on doctor's orders \n‘I lost my dad last year, but I also became a dad,’ said Duncan. ‘I was sending a lot of time after getting over the shock trying to work out what would I want my son to know about his grandad.’ \n‘And I think it will be the same thing that most of my dad’s fans have taken in the last 50 years, that he has always been there supporting people who are a bit weird or a bit strange, or a bit different and he’s always been there for them.’ \nHe finished: ‘So this awards’ for all the kooks and all the people who make the kooks, thanks.’ \nLittle Mix also had a good night, scooping their first ever Brit Award and dedicating the gong to their ex-boyfriends. \nThe girls took home British Single of the Year for their smash hit Shout Out To My Ex and during a speech in which they thanked each other and admitted that without their friendship ‘they wouldn’t still be going’, they also took the time to thank the lads who had broken their hearts and led to the writing of the song. \n(Notably, Zayn Malik .) \nTaking the mic Jade Thirwall said: ‘Cheers to our exes for helping us to do an amazing song, this one’s for you lads.’ \nOther big winners of the night included The 1975 who won Best British Group and One Direction who took home the publicly-voted award of the night, Best British Artist Music Video for History. \n‘One Direction is who we are and who we always will be,’ said Liam Payne, who accepted the award on behalf of the boys. Rag ‘N’ Bone Man continued his success by taking home Best British Breakthrough Act, just months after being named the Brit Awards Critics Choice Winner .
