For the first eight years it was hidden, felt rather than seen. Then, in 1987, it became visible with Air Max. The revolution had begun. It quickly spread, from running to basketball to training and tennis, at the same time becoming a coveted lifestyle product across the globe. After 30 years, Air Max continues to evolve.

This fresh line-up of Air, including the long-awaited Nike Air VaporMax, proves the potential of Air has never been stronger at Nike.
