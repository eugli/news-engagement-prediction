He will be interviewed by the police on his plans after he returns to Malaysia,” he added. \nSelva Kumar, 57, was convicted at two separate trials more than two decades ago of drugging and sexually assaulting 30 women. \nMeanwhile, Wanita MCA chief Datuk Heng Seai Kie hit out at DAP Gelugor MP Ramkarpal Singh for playing down the wing’s call for a sex offenders registry as a safeguard against the return of Selva Kumar as a contravention of the Federal Constitution. \nHeng, who is adviser on national unity and integration in the Prime Minister’s Department, urged Ramkarpal to read Wanita MCA’s statement in full as their stand was clear, constructive, and neither unprecedented nor uncalled for. \nShe said he missed the wing’s point about enacting laws so that Malaysians who committed sex offences overseas are made to face charges back home. \n“We had cited British courts of sentencing serial paedophile Richard Huckle to 22 life sentences for paedophilia committed in Malaysia. \n“We may not be the top constitutional lawyer or expert, but we know it is our duty to protect our people,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:38:46.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
