But the name, says Lootz, has been taken “totally, totally out of context.\n“The Tupac latte is not on our menu, it was never, really, meant to be on there,” he said.\nDuring a media interview, a customer “who had been playfully ordering” the drink since the café opened, happened to order it, said Lootz, which is how word of the drink got out.\nThe five dots of milk to represent bullet holes “happened on the spot” for the photo, said Lootz, adding that prior to that there was just regular latte milk art for it.\n“The drink is not even on the menu. It will not be available in the future despite a swell of demand from the controversy out of sensitivity to those who may take offence,” said café owner, Jihae Chae,\nBut references to murdered black hip hop artists are not limited to the latte. A post on the café’s Instagram shows a sandwich-board sign with a chalk drawing of The Notorious B.I.G. holding an espresso cup saying, “Who double shot ya?”\nLootz says the café would “never disrespect such a huge legend, (Tupac), and pretty much the cornerstone of my youth.”\nThe media attention has been earning the café lots of “likes” on Instagram, he said, adding “I think for the true hip hop heads and fans out there they get the reference.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:43:05.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
