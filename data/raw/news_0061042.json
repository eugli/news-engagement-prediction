Media caption White supremacist Richard Spencer: 'Donald Trump's arrow is pointing in our direction.' \nHe condemned Mr Schneider's speech as \"totally stupid\", and in a tweet paraphrased a Mahatma Gandhi quote: \"First they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they fight you. Then you win.\" \nAs he was talking to reporters, a security guard approached to escort him from the conference. \nShortly after the election of Donald Trump, who Mr Spencer supports, he came to Washington where he led an alt-right gathering in making Nazi salutes while chanting: \"Heil Trump!\" \nHe was also punched in the face during protests that shook the US capital in the days after Mr Trump's inauguration as US president.
