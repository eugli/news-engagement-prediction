The officers continued to help with donations and other support after she and her son, 1-year-old Martin Hernandez, Jr., lost their home. \n\"I came to understand the gift of life is to be appreciated and not to be taken for granted,\" Garcia posted on Facebook as she marked the anniversary of the Feb. 19, 2016 fire. \"Asking everyone to cherish each and every second we have with our loved ones because we truly never know when is our last.\" \nTHROWBACK PHOTOS: Pasadena police pose with mysterious gorillas in the '70s \nGarcia said her only warning of the fire, at the Maple Trail apartments at 2001 Burke Road, came from a neighbor who shouted at her from the apartment below. \nIt was about 4 a.m., and she was trapped in her second-story apartment with her cousin, Jesus Ramirez, and her baby, who was then 4 months old. \nRamirez broke an apartment window and escaped, but suffered a serious laceration to his arm and passed out. Garcia said she looked out the window and saw a police officer yelling to her from below. \n\"He was trying to convince me to toss my baby out the window,\" Garcia said. After thinking about it briefly, she complied, and little Martin escaped with just a few scratches. \nGarcia then jumped and was caught by two people. She suffered a severe cut on her hand that rendered it unusable as it healed, and caused lasting damage to two fingers. \nGarcia's neighbor, David Brown, 62, died in the fire, as did his dog. \nRuth Garcia shares video of the apartment complex where she and her infant son escaped a deadly fire through a second-story window. Media: MediaOS Video \nPasadena police officers John Lisano and Ryan Childers are credited with saving Garcia and Martin and received commendation for their actions . \nAfter being released from Memorial Hermann Hospital, Garcia said she received donations from local fire fighters and her coworkers at a Stripes convenience store to help her get back on her feet and find a new place to live. \nShe has since moved to another Pasadena apartment complex, on the first floor. \"I can't do second floor anymore,\" she said. Garcia also has two other children, 9-year-old Daniel Amador, Jr., and 7-year-old Delyla Amador, and shares custody of those children with their father and grandparents. \nNewly inspired to get the most out of life, Garcia has gone back to school at San Jacinto College Central, where she is studying sonography. After school in the morning, she goes to work at the Flying J travel stop in Baytown. \n\"It's a sacrifice, but I have to better myself for me and my kids,\" Garcia said. \nShe's also appeared in a Pasadena police recruiting video, telling her story as an example of how officers can make a difference. \nMartin turned 1 last fall, and Garcia threw him a first responder-themed birthday party. She hopes a story he's too little to remember will inspire him as he gets older. \n\"I want to show him what I have done for him, for him to appreciate life,\" Garcia said of her son. \nGarcia said the Pasadena Fire Marshal's Office has completed an investigation on the cause of the deadly fire. Officials were not available to comment on the investigation at press time.
