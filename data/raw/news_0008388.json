Thank you. @HonJohnMcCallum and @HonStephaneDion have given decades of service to Canada, and continue to make our country a better place. pic.twitter.com/AVBq9BmZQG \n— Liberal Party (@liberal_party) January 31, 2017 \nDion, who represents a Montreal riding, was shuffled out of cabinet earlier this month in favour of Chrystia Freeland, a move widely seen as part of the Liberal government’s response to the ascendance of Donald Trump. \nREAD MORE: Cabinet shuffle: Changes come as Canada braces for President Donald Trump \nDion did not initially accept the “senior position” he was offered by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , a sign that he was not happy about the decision to relive him of his portfolio. \nMcCallum, the Markham-area MP who was also shuffled out of cabinet earlier this month, has already agreed to serve as Canada’s ambassador to China. \nIn a statement, Trudeau hailed Dion’s continuing dedication to public service. \n“Stéphane’s commitment to Canada knows few parallels, and I am grateful he has agreed to undertake this unique and important task.
