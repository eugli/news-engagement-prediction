(Susan Walsh/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   6:55 PM \nAny attempt to renegotiate NAFTA will have to be a hat trick, Canadian officials said Tuesday — because all three nations need a chance to even the score. \nThe discussion of a possible do-over of NAFTA has been kicking around D.C. since President Trump’s election. \nThe Republican won support from many union rank-and-file with his vow to put America first in trade agreements — and even some labor leaders now say that’s a Trump goal they can get behind. \nBut there will be no talks with Canada unless Mexico is also involved, Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s foreign minister, said Tuesday at a conference on the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement. \nTrump takes softball questions at talk with Canadian leader \n“We very much recognize that NAFTA is a three-nation agreement and were there to be any negotiations, those would be three-way negotiations,” Freeland said. \nBut that’s not the way Trump — who claims that free trade treaties have stolen away thousands of American jobs — wants talks to go. \nHis main focus is on rewriting the elements of NAFTA that deal with the U.S. relationship with Mexico. \nTrade ties with Canada only need a few minor alterations to be perfect, Trump has said. \nTrump’s trade war with Mexico could cause illegal immigration \nMexico’s foreign minister Luis Videgaray had the same message as Freeland when he spoke to reporters Tuesday at Toronto’s trade conference. \n“NAFTA is a three-party agreement and any conversation we have regarding that ... will be a three-party conversation; it has to be,” Videgaray said, according to Reuters. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Canada won't exclude Mexico from NAFTA talks. (Jae C. Hong/AP) \nEither way, a wholesale rewrite of NAFTA — at least the parts touching the U.S. and Mexico — is not likely, experts agree. \nBut talks about some changes are expected to begin this summer, the Mexican government believes, according to Ildefonso Guajardo, the country’s economy minister. \nFormer Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who helped launch the original NAFTA talks in 1994, dismissed any discussion of Canada trying to freeze out Mexico. \n“This under-the-bus stuff is for losers, not for winners,” he told the conference. \nBoth Canada and Mexico also indicated they are still eyeing Trump’s picks for commerce secretary and trade representative, which have yet to be confirmed. \n“We all have to collectively be careful not to get ahead of ourselves,” Freeland said. \nPierre Trudeau had an important message for Donald Trump in 1981 \nAs for Trump’s oft-repeated threat that he will impose border tariffs on Mexican exports, especially those made by U.S. companies, officials Tuesday dismissed it out of hand. \n“Nothing in the new NAFTA should be a step backward. We will definitely not include any type of trade management measures, like quotas, or open the Pandora’s box of tariffs,” Guajardo told Reuters. “That will be disastrous in any process moving forward.” \nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:18:32.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
