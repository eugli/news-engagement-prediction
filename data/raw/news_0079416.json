His boat is struck by a huge cargo ship. Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. \nThe iPad is not perfect. CNET \nWe've come to believe that technology can do everything for us. \nPerhaps that's how we've come to be the thoughtless beings that we are. \nI drift into philosophical waters because of David Carlin and a fascinating accident report just released by the UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch. \nLast May, Carlin, 34, was at the helm of a 50-foot oak and mahogany boat named Peggotty. It hailed from the days of World War II and Carlin wanted to sell it. So he decided to sail it from Grimsby to Hull for a survey and brought along a representative for the potential buyer. \nThe Peggotty was, however, blessed with neither a compass, nor fully working navigational equipment. \nStill, what could go wrong? The other man in the boat had an iPad. \niPads have apps that can do everything, after all. And, indeed, his passenger -- who had previously worked as the captain of a safety boat -- opened his navigational app and began directing the way across the Humber Estuary, a waterway that enjoys quite some traffic. \nThen the Wi-Fi failed. \nThe mental navigation system in your mind already tells you that the Peggotty was struck by trouble. More precisely, it was struck by the Petunia Seaways, a cargo ship 1,400 times larger than the 50-footer. Indeed, the Petunia Seaways is so big that she felt nothing. She wafted along to Sweden. \nMeanwhile, Carlin, who had heard one lone fog signal but wasn't sure where it had come from, had to issue a mayday as his boat began to sink. He and his passenger were rescued by a passing boat. The Peggotty had, indeed, strayed into a shipping lane. \nThe report says that the master of the Petunia Seaways reacted too late, as the Peggotty was visible. The master should also have sounded his foghorn more than once. \nYou might imagine that Carlin wasn't an experienced captain. However, even though this was off-duty activity, he's a pilot with Associated British Ports.
