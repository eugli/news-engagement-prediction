The curved screen of the S7 remains as does the 3.5mm headphone port. The phone looks very similar to its predecessor though it’s missing the physical and capacitive buttons found on the previous model. Instead, it looks like Samsung is employing a row of software buttons. \nThe videos are short and do not show off much of the phone’s design. Though with the phone’s official unveiling a month away, there will likely be more leaks and previews. 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:15:45.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
