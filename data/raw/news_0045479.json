Cricket terms should be 'gender neutral', argues Australian official Cricket should promote 'gender neutral' terms, according to an Australian cricket administrator Credit: AP Mark Molloy 21 February 2017 • 1:14pm \nG ender neutral terms like batter and 12th should be introduced in cricket to make the game more inclusive for women, an Australian cricket administrator has said. \nThe current male-centric terms used “disrespect half the population” of Australia, Western Australia Cricket Association chief executive Christina Matthews argues. \n“Here we are, in 2017, using terms such as 12th man, batsman, fieldsman and nightwatchman,” she told PerthNow . \n“In my view, there’s no common sense reason why [the terms can’t be changed]. I think it’s just something people have held on to.” Indian women's cricket team captain Mithali Raj, left, and her South African counterpart Dane van Niekerk Credit: AP \nS he added: “Words matter, and words demonstrate respect as well. By not changing the terms, you’re disrespecting half the population. \n“I’m not saying people are deliberately trying to offend but it’s a bit like bullying – whether you’re bullied or not is dictated by the person who is on the end of it, not the person who’s doing it.” \nPerth Scorchers fast bowler Piepa Cleary agreed that attitudes to female cricketers needed to change, but admitted it could take a “long time”. \n“Everyone still says female athletes or female cricket, but we’re athletes playing cricket,” she said. \n“We need to stop being compared to the men’s game and be recognised for playing the sport in our own field. \n“It’s going to take a long time to change, but hopefully it will start to happen sooner rather than later.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:18:53.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
