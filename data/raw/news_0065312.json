Even if Sunday and public holiday rates were further lowered, he said, they still would not meet the costs of staffing. \n“To be honest, the rates going down won’t alleviate the need for a surcharge on public holiday,” he said. \nUnder the new rules, fulltime and part-time hospitality workers will have Sunday rates slashed from 175 per cent to 150 per cent and Sunday rates for casuals will remain at 175 per cent. \nIf they’re on the national minimum wage, $17.70 per hour, an eight-hour Sunday shift will earn them about $248. \nUnder the changes that drops to $212. It’s a difference of about $35 for the shift, but it’s still significantly more than the $141 the boss would have to fork out for their shift on a weekday. \nOn public holidays, rates for fulltime and part-time workers have also been cut from 250 per cent to 225 per cent, and casuals will remain at 250 per cent for public holidays. Hospo workers will be paid less on Sundays, but don’t necessarily expect that saving to be passed on. Picture: iStock.

They don’t apply to workers covered by the restaurant industry which include reception centres, night clubs, cafes and road houses, and restaurants where employees aren’t employed under the hospitality industry award. \nThe restaurant award, however, is expected to undergo similar changes too. \nMr Hart said in businesses covered by both of these awards, the money employers spend on staff accounts for around half of everything they make, so even with the reduced rates, they’re still likely to charge a little extra to get by. \n“At 225 per cent (on a public holiday), you’re still paying more than double time,” Mr Hart said. \n“As it stands at the moment, wages are nearly 50 per cent of turnover. Even with these changes you’re still in a place where there is an extraordinary amount of additional cost, which isn’t met by any sort of surcharges.” \nNot everyone shares Mr Hart’s gloomy view. \nHerron Todd White’s research director Rick Carr has said he believes the changes mean surcharges should eventually disappear, giving a boost to local economies, particularly in high-traffic and tourism areas. \n“The dreaded Sunday surcharges should disappear, tourists and locals will have more choice on where to go each Sunday, and the overall economy should benefit,” he told the Cairns Post . \n“At the same time economic theory says that if Sunday penalty rates are cut then fewer people will be prepared to work on a Sunday as the financial reward for doing so is no longer there. \n“Businesses could find it harder to recruit staff for Sunday work, make fewer businesses actually able to operate on Sundays, and have a net economic disbenefit.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:14:37.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
