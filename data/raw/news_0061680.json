Horror footage shows tiny dog ‘strapped with explosives by ISIS’ Suicide PUPPIES? Horror footage shows tiny dog ‘strapped with explosives by ISIS’ DISTURBING new footage has appeared online of a tiny dog wearing a form of suicide-vest in Iraq. PUBLISHED: 11:46, Sat, Feb 25, 2017 | UPDATED: 12:12, Sat, Feb 25, 2017 PMU Islamic State have reportedly strapped homemade suicide belts to dogs \nThe authenticity of the video is currently unclear but it appears to show Islamic State jihadis, known for their improvisations on the battlefield, wrapping the tiny animal’s torso with explosives before sending it across the front line. \nThe horrifying video was apparently uploaded online by fighters with the Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Units. \nThe PMU, or Al-Hashd Al-Sha'abi, is a group of militia, brought together and state-sponsored to battle with jihadis in Iraq. \nIn 2014 the group was incorporated into the country’s armed forces to help fight on the battlefield as major cities were overtaken by terrorists. \nThree fighters crouch over the small animal in the video, one resting a knife on the ground as they speak to the camera about the find.
