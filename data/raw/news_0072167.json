Jay Onrait (left) and Dan O'Toole on set in Los Angeles. By Raju Mudhar Tech Reporter Thu., Feb. 23, 2017 Fox Sports 1’s great Canadian sports broadcasting experiment is over. According to a report from John Ourand of the Sports Business Daily, the network has cancelled Jay Onrait’s and Dan O’Toole’s Fox Sports Live show and will not be renewing their contracts, which are up in March. There is already speculation the pair might return to TSN, where the two were beloved by Canadian sports fans as they honed their on-air partnership and irreverent take on sports highlights as the late nights host of SportsCentre from 2003 to 2013. FS1 hired away the pair — along with their producer Tim Moriarty — from TSN in 2013, with Onrait and O’Toole moving to California to be the headliners of Fox Sports Live, that network’s flagship launch show. At the time, their move was highly publicized, but the show has suffered from many format changes, rotating personnel and low ratings. Despite that, the pair has also been favourites of U.S. sports media critics, like Sports Illustrated’s Richard Deitsch, who praised them for not changing their style. Fox Sports Live’s last show aired Wednesday night, and the cast and crew were reportedly informed of the decision Thursday morning. Article Continued Below Sentiment online had many Canadian fans hoping the pair would return to Canada, and author James Miller, who wrote the oral history These Guys Have All The Fun: Inside the world of ESPN, tweeted after the news broke: “Silver lining for @JayOnrait after cancellation of @foxsportslive — Hearing he will be returning to @TSN_Sports in Canada.” One of the reasons the show was reportedly cancelled is that FS1 has changed to a strategy of having more opinionated hosts and Onrait and O’Toole’s humorous take didn’t fit in with that plan.
