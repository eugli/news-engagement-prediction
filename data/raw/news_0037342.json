UCLA fans fill the student section for a game against Indiana State in 2012 at Pauley Pavilion. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) Ben Bolch ’s iconic basketball cheer, Larry “Frisbee” Davis would feel affirmation in the earsplitting response of Bruins students inside Pauley Pavilion.\nYes, that’s a basketball. Yes, that’s the court. Yes, that’s the l sing team. \nAs he watched a student perform his cheer last month during a game against Arizona, Davis experienced considerably less pleasure. He felt his raucous delight had turned into a hollow version of itself. \n“I’m sitting up there and the students are doing the cheer,” Davis said this week in a telephone interview, “and it’s terrible, absolutely terrible. Now the way they perform it, it’s an afterthought. It’s really an embarrassment. It’s nothing compared to what I started and what it became.” \nThe Frisbee Cheer has devolved, its inventor feels, into something more sterile and choreographed than originally intended. The student leading the cheer stands in one spot, holding a basketball aloft while facing a camera that projects his or her image onto the scoreboard video screen. \nFor the roughly 25 years he led the chant, first as a student and then as an alumnus, Davis preferred to face the students directly. He also enjoyed the freedom to roam the court, sprinting up to Larry Brown on the sideline the night Brown made his debut as Bruins coach in November 1979. Davis pointed at Brown before commencing an ad-libbed routine that played off the coach’s purported charm. \nThe Joe E. Brown All-Stars, Bank of America and Universal Pictures don’t find their way onto UCLA ’s schedule anymore. \nIt may sound like the stuff of Hollywood, but those were actual opponents of the Bruins in the 1930s and 1940s.

Equally surreal was what was happening in the rivalry between UCLA... (Ben Bolch) \nIs this Larry Brown? Is he our new coach? Does he have charisma? \nEvery part of the cheer Davis popularized now seems mundane to him. \n“It’s depressing and it’s frustrating,” Davis said, “because I know how good it could be and I know how much fun everyone could have doing it if it were done properly.” \nIn the dozen or so years since he last regularly performed his cheer, Davis said he’s reached out to representatives of the Den, UCLA’s student athletics organization, in an effort to teach the nuances of the routine. Sometimes he’s gotten no response, he said, and other times he’s been told the students needed to go through the athletic department “and it goes nowhere.” \nA UCLA spokesman said the Den had not been contacted other than receiving a forwarded email from Davis about his wanting to lead his old cheer at a game, something he last did with the school’s permission in 2011. The spokesman added that allowing a different student to perform the cheer at each game served as a tribute to Davis’ legacy, providing those students with their own memories of a lifetime. \nDavis, who remains a constant presence at UCLA football and basketball games, wanted to make it clear that he’s not groveling. \n“Remember now, I’m not going to go up to an 18-year-old kid and beg to do something that I started before his parents were born, OK?” said Davis, a longtime estate planning attorney based in Northridge. “I’m 61 years old. There comes a point where you say, ‘That’s it. The school knows how to reach me.’ ” Ben Bolch \nUCLA continues to fare better with Associated Press poll voters than those who are projecting NCAA tournament seedings. \nThe Bruins climbed four spots to No. 6 in the AP rankings on Monday but have remained inert in postseason prognostications despite winning four consecutive games. \n. \nThe NCAA tournament... \nUCLA continues to fare better with Associated Press poll voters than those who are projecting NCAA tournament seedings. \nThe Bruins climbed four spots to No. 6 in the AP rankings on Monday but have remained inert in postseason prognostications despite winning four consecutive games. \n. \nThe NCAA tournament... (Ben Bolch) \nDavis was the one trying to reach his fellow students when he started the cheer as a UCLA undergraduate majoring in biochemistry. Interest in the school’s basketball team had waned a bit in the two years after legendary coach John Wooden retired, with attendance at Pauley Pavilion dipping about 1,000 fans per game from Wooden’s final season in 1974-75. \nDavis got the idea while watching Pepperdine water polo players perform a similar cheer in support of their school’s volleyball team during a match against UCLA. He later learned it had been performed previously at a Pepperdine swim meet, where a student stood up and asked, “Are those the starting blocks? Is that a diving board?” \nDavis did something that made the cheer entirely his own. He copyrighted it. \nThe unveiling of the cheer at Pauley Pavilion during the 1976-77 season was modest, Davis starting with a small group of classmates before it quickly mushroomed to the entire student section. Davis was soon given access to the court, allowing him to engage the whole crowd. \n“Every once in a while,” Davis said, “I was able to get the alumni into it and that made it really fun when you could get 10,000 or 12,000 people doing it.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:46:45.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
