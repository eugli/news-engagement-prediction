And while today's might not be a brand new look at Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which was last month's surprise alongside the title reveal, you greedy lot, the poster promoting April's Star Wars Celebration event in Orlando will instantly pull at the heart strings and make you feel all nice, warm and fuzzy inside. That's because it's laced in nostalgia and is a glorious call-back to the franchise's long and storied history. You can have at it below.

It's the sort of poster that you could proudly hang on your wall or even get tattooed on your face. OK, the latter might be stretching it, but it's still very pretty. \nAs well as the above poster, new details regarding Orlando's Star Wars Celebration have also come to light. And since 2017 marks the 40th anniversary of the release of Star Wars: A New Hope , the event has a spectacular array of nerdy shenanigans for fans to enjoy. \nIn fact, Star Wars Celebration's organizers have now confirmed that a very special tribute to the 40th anniversary of Star Wars will kickstart the entire weekend. This panel will be hosted by Warwick Davis, who played the Ewok Wicket in Star Wars Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi , and it will also feature Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy. Rather than simply being a back-and-forth between the duo, Star Wars Celebration has also teased that some of the franchise's brightest stars will also be part of the discussion, without confirming who they will actually be. \nDavis, Kennedy and whoever they can convince to join them will then talk at length about the impact of Star Wars on the pop culture landscape, and how the fans and viewers have helped to evolve the series beyond cinema and into a bona-fide phenomenon over the last 40 years. \nSince Star Wars Celebration lasts from Thursday, April 13 all the way through to Sunday, April 16 at Orlando's Orange County Convention Center, a whole heap of revelations and surprises regarding the franchise's past, present and future are set to be announced during the extravaganza. \nMost recently there has been speculation that the very first footage for Star Wars: The Last Jedi will debut at Star Wars Celebration. It's then expected that, to save those of us that are unable to attend from gut-wrenching jealousy, this trailer or behind-the-scenes clip will then be uploaded to the internet soon after. Either way, stay tuned to CinemaBlend in the build up to and throughout Star Wars Celebration, as we'll provide constant updates on the array of revelations that will undoubtedly be made over the course of the four days.
