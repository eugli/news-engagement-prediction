Linked to that is that the coach of Bayern Munich pays 5,000 euros to the Sepp-Herberger charity.\" \nThe DFB charity is named after the late Germany coach and works on several social projects.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:23:30.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
