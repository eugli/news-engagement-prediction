Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA homeowner claims he has been 'overcharged' so much by Npower that he is now £20,000 in CREDIT. \nTwo-and-a-half years ago David Redfern's energy bills for his three-bedroom house rocketed from £60 a month to nearer £500 for no reason he could fathom. \nAll that time he's been locked in dispute with the utilities firm - and in the meantime he has had to keep paying his bills, fearing he would be cut off. \nSince he got his meter replaced in November, his gas and electricity has subsequently shrunk by more than £430 a month - from an enormous £478.89 to more manageable £48. \nAccording to calculations, David should now not have to pay another bill for the next 33 years. \nBut he has been stressed out all this time trying to cope with the huge bills - and trying to use less power. David Redfern did everything he could to cut his electricity usage (Photo: Nottingham Post / SWNS.com) \nThe online marketing expert told the Nottingham Post how he has been constantly fighting the utilities firm - but carried on paying the huge monthly amount in the meantime. \nThe problem was finally solved in November, when Npower agreed to change the meter at his home in Newthorpe, Notts. \nDavid has now spoken out about how the enormous bills affected his and his partner's living habits - as he wants to try and warn others who have been wrongly charged. \nHe explained: \"We have been paying them a lot of money for a long time now for a three-bedroom house. \n\"It's a crazy amount of money, we are now that much in credit. \n\"Our electricity bill just went up dramatically. Npower says it is investigating (Photo: PA) \n\"I assumed it was because we had a hot tub, or maybe that just electricity prices are rising. \n\"I even went to the trouble of replacing every single lightbulb and light with LED. \n\"We hardly use any electricity - we are extremely cautious. But with these bills, it was like we had a fairground running. \n\"My business doesn't even use as much as this. \n\"I used the washing machine once a day, but thought that was being excessive. \n\"I've been arguing with Npower for years and years. \n\"I just knew I shouldn't be using this much, even when I bought consumption meters. \n\"But I knew I had to pay it. The Npower bill reduced when his meter was changed (Photo: PA) \n\"I don't think it's fair on all these other people who are probably affected. \n\"I have been in the fortunate position where I've actually managed to pay it, but a lot of other people wouldn't have been in that position and could have been cut off. \n\"There are probably other customers around the UK who have had this problem. \n\"People should really look into this and not just accept it. \n\"We need to help all these people who are potentially struggling. \n\"It's detrimental to people's lifestyles.\" \nA tweet David shared on his seo77 Twitter account, expressing his anger at the over-charge, has been retweeted more than 4,000 times. \nDavid said once he successfully got Npower to change his meter over, he saw his bills drop to £60. \nHe said the stress of paying the massive bills had taken its toll, and he had to throw himself into his business to ensure he could keep up the payments.
