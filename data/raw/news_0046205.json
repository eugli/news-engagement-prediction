The anger within Labour led to him being challenged for the leadership within days of the June vote.

If you just want a three word slogan, that’s not his style.” \nHe called the media coverage of the campaign “an argument over two sections of the Right”. Dylan Martinez / Reuters Corbyn's campaigning for Remain led Labour colleagues to question his position on Brexit \nWhen O’Brien put it to him that this may have been due to Corbyn’s failure to step up, Loach said: “May well be... I’m not in his office. \n“But the overwhelming central point is you’ve got to look at the vast number of MPs who refuse to put out what the members want and what the leadership is asking.” \nHe said these MPs were “refusing to promote the very policies that people need.” \nHe praised Shadow Pensions Secretary Debbie Abrahams for committing to abolishing assessments that allow the Department of Work and Pensions to overrule doctors who say benefits claimants aren’t fit to work. \nThis is central to his film I, Daniel Blake, which is about a 59-year-old joiner forced to look for work, despite being unwell after suffering a massive heart attack. \n“If you listen to Jeremy Corbyn he is making it,” Loach said, when O’Brien asked why Labour was failing “to make the case you’re making in cinemas.” \nThe film maker added: “The problem lies with the Labour MPs who don’t represent the party membership, that voted 60% or more for Jeremy Corbyn. \n“They don’t promote the policies and so the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell is left stranded.” \nIn an interview with HuffPost UK last year , Loach said he voted to remain in the EU despite his issues with the bloc, which he called “a project to support big capital.” Related...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:07:58.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
