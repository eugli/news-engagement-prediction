The talent won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Moonlight at the 89th Academy Awards. { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"live\", \"id\" : 4422, \"name\" : \"Hit Nation\", \"description\" : \"All of Today's Biggest Hits\" } } \nThis was the very first nomination for Ali, who's been acting for over 15 years now. So, imagine his excitement -- and ours -- when he received this honor the first time he was considered for it. Many actors/actresses have been nominated time and time again without ever having the honor of taking home any trophies, in their careers. \nBy Ali winning this Oscar, history was made tonight (Feb. 26). He became the first Muslim to win an Academy award! Being that the United States is currently in a very critical, divided time; this win meant just that much more. \"It was about Juan. It was about Chiron. It was about Paula.\" Congratulations to Mahershala Ali, an inspiration to us all. #MOONLIGHT ✨ pic.twitter.com/gGKKgB80Ha — MOONLIGHT Movie (@moonlightmov) February 27, 2017 \nDuring his acceptance speech, Ali thanked the cast and crew members of Moonlight , as well as revealed that he just welcomed a newborn daughter four days ago with his wife. What a great week he's having! \nListen to his speech below. Mahershala Ali thanks his wife: \"She was in her third trimester during awards season. We just had our daughter 4 days ago.\" #Oscars pic.twitter.com/WpRi6RYlGr — Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017 \nCongrats, Mahershala Ali! And thank you for making history!
