The 34-year-old Irish actor appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Tuesday, and revealed why he decided to shave his head months after wrapping on the filming of the erotic book-turned-movies. \"It's for work,\" Dornan -- who is rumored to be starring in Robin Hood next year -- said of his haircut. \"In my early '20s, I used to have a shaved head quite a lot. So, I know that I don't have one of those weird shapes.\" While Dornan has come up quickly in Hollywood, he admitted that he got turned off at the idea of living in Los Angeles after he ran into '90s model Fabio at the gym a number of years ago.

He was doing pull-ups and had a crowd around him.\" Photo: Getty Images This display didn't impress Dornan, who added, \"He was doing enough [pull-ups] to form a crowd. I didn't join the crowd. I just sort of went, 'Well maybe L.A.'s not for me.'\" Kimmel joked, \"Maybe [Fabio] could be part of your Rat Pack.\" MORE: Fifty Shades Darker Star Jamie Dornan Isn't Interested in S&M -- 'It Doesn't Float My Boat' \"He'd look great in a tux,\" Dornan replied. Kimmel didn't grill Dornan about his sexy scenes with Dakota Johnson in Fifty Shades Darker, but the actor did speak exclusively with ET about how much nudity fans can expect on his part. \"The truth is that I don’t know the answer to that,\" he said when asked about full-frontal scenes. \"You’ll have to wait and see.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T17:15:19.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
