Apparently Flynn's demise was pure Team Obama: the ends justify the means. https://t.co/Lz7OgsqQle \n— Varad Mehta (@varadmehta) February 14, 2017 \nMichael Flynn may have been a crappy, inept choice for national security adviser, but as The Week’s Damon Linker points out, even those pleased at Flynn’s ouster should be concerned by how it came about: 1/8. My new column, about how no one should be cheering the way Flynn was brought down. https://t.co/NsJXzFe4Mx \n— Damon Linker (@DamonLinker) February 14, 2017 2/8 Flynn was brought down by a disinformation campaign orchestrated by unelected, anonymous members of the surveillance state. \n— Damon Linker (@DamonLinker) February 14, 2017 3/8 @EliLake is right to call this police-state tactics. https://t.co/ybjyVlnNv2 \n— Damon Linker (@DamonLinker) February 14, 2017 4/8 Now the Free Beacon reports a key player in promulgating the story re Flynn was @brhodes https://t.co/IwCilZYFuE \n— Damon Linker (@DamonLinker) February 14, 2017 5/8 Rhodes isn't just a former Obama staffer. \n— Damon Linker (@DamonLinker) February 14, 2017 6/8 You'll recall from David Samuels blockbuster NYT Mag profile last May, Rhodes is someone who excels at manipulating the media. \n— Damon Linker (@DamonLinker) February 14, 2017 7/8 Message to media: You're being played—turning yourself into what Bannon insists you are: an opposition party deploying weaponized spin. \n— Damon Linker (@DamonLinker) February 14, 2017 8/8 Worse, you’re working to destroy reputations w clandestinely acquired information peddled by people hiding behind a cloak of anonymity. \n— Damon Linker (@DamonLinker) February 14, 2017 PS: Down this road lies the end of democracy in America. \n— Damon Linker (@DamonLinker) February 14, 2017 Trending 'Shame on you': Conservatives blast Bill Kristol for this post-Flynn-resignation tweet \nThe end of Democracy in America? We’re not quite there yet, but it would definitely behoove the media — and any liberals — rejoicing at Flynn’s resignation to remember that this knife cuts both ways. If the “deep state” can mess with Trump’s administration, they can mess with a Democrat’s, too. \n***", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:52:33.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
