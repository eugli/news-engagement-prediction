Max Bretos of ESPN summed up the bizarre trend: Maximiliano Bretos @mbretosESPN 2/26/2017, 10:31:04 PM Suddenly, lesser-known drivers such as Cole Whitt and Aric Almirolo were leading the most famous race in the sport. Joey Logano and Elliott eventually took over and battled for the lead with the race finally clearing up. Those in contention moved to single file with under 10 laps remaining, with Elliott leading the pack. When it seemed as though Elliott would come away with his first career win, he ran out of fuel with just two laps remaining. The same happened to Kyle Larson, who briefly led before fading in the final laps. Earnhardt was one of many on edge watching the nerve-racking conclusion: Dale Earnhardt Jr. @DaleJr 2/26/2017, 11:23:00 PM Busch ultimately came through with the win, largely because he avoided catastrophe during a wreck-filled day. The NASCAR season is now in full swing, with the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 taking place next Sunday at Atlanta Motor Speedway. While the year is just getting started, all of these drivers know how valuable getting an early win would be. Post-Race Reaction \"My rearview mirror fell off with 30 to go,\" Kurt Busch said after his win, per Performance Racing Network . \"I said that's an omen.\" If that didn't sum up the craziness of the race, he elaborated on it later. \" The more unpredictable it becomes at Daytona, the more predictable it becomes in its unpredictability ,\" Busch added, per Heather Tucker of USA Today . Kyle Busch likely wanted to end the race in his car, but he at least got a chance to watch his older brother earn his first Daytona win: Kyle Busch @KyleBusch 2/26/2017, 11:33:53 PM Another notable driver who didn't finish the race remained upbeat afterward. \"We had a great car,\" Earnhardt said, per Nate Ryan of NBC Sports. \"At least we went out leading the race.\" The long list of drivers who made early exits can only hope to bounce back with a more favorable finish next week in Atlanta.
