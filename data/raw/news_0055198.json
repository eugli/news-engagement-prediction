Thundercat’s collaboration with Kendrick Lamar, “Walk On By,” follows closely behind, while Young Scooter and Young Thug’s “Cook Up” sizzles with production from Metro Boomin and Zaytoven in the fourth position. Audio Push’s “Smokeout ’99,” an instrumental version of De La Soul’s Grammy Award-nominated And The Anonymous Nobody , Khalid’s “American Teen,” Jidenna’s “Bambi,” Belly and Future’s “Frozen Water,” Ace Hood’s “Guess Who,” Locksmith’s “Nobody,” and a freestyle from Dreamville Record’s J.I.D also help reel in the weekend. Dive in. migos f. 2 chainz –“deadz” \nMigos continues its winning streak with a new video for “Deadz” featuring 2 Chainz, which follows their chart-topping album, Culture . Directed by Daps, who also directed the winterized cinematic video for “T-Shirt,” the video has a similar dramatic feel with an orchestra and dead presidents in a collection of caskets. Dressed to kill, the four rappers swap lyrics over the bass heavy, Cardo-produced track, sending a little message Migos is here to stay … at least for now. Check out the video above. Thundercat f. kendrick lamar. –“walk on by” \nBass impresario Thundercat is preparing to release his third studio album, Drunk, Friday (February 24) and in anticipation of the event, has shared a third single from the album, “Walk On By,” featuring the one and only Kendrick Lamar. The groovy track follows “Friend Zone” and “Show You The Way.” Listen quickly. It’s been vanishing from sites left and right. young scooter f. young thug –“Cook up” \nWith production from highly sought after beatmakers Metro Boomin and Zaytoven, Young Scooter’s “Cook Up” also finds Young Thug along for the ride. Scooter is preparing his Jugg King project, which is due out later this year and this track serves as the second single from the album. Audio Push –“Smokeout ’99” \nPrice and Oktane of Audio Push are back with another chilled out track, “Smokeout ’99,” which offers production from Larry Belafonte. The track uses the same sample from T.I. and Young Thug’s “About The Money,” but revolves around their favorite extracurricular activity. “Smokeout ’99” comes on the heels of the duo’s My Turn 3 EP . Lay back and enjoy. De La Soul –“And the anonymous nobody (instrumentals)” \nDe La Soul has released an all instrumental version of the New York City trio’s Grammy Award-nominated album, And The Anonymous Nobody . Although they didn’t take home the coveted golden gramophone, the project is still one of the Hip Hop pioneers’ most creative and eclectic bodies of work — and that’s saying a lot. khalid- “american teen” \nEighteen-year-old Texas singer Khalid is on a roll with his latest single, “American Teen,” the title track from his forthcoming album. The song cleverly utilizes ’80s synthesizers and electric drums as the El Paso native sings about being “from the 915” and “high off my American dream.” Pre-order the album here. Jidenna –“Bambi” \nDirected by Fear and Fancy, Jidenna’s new video for “Bambi” depicts the artist chasing after a lost love (in slow motion) once he finds out she’s marrying another man. Apparently, her name is Bambi and alas, he does not get the girl. The song comes from his highly anticipated album, The Chief, which he released earlier this month. Cop the album here. belly f. Future- “frozen water” \nBelly is back with the Future -assisted visuals for the brooding track, “Frozen Water,” which was featured on the Roc Nation signee’s 2016 mixtape, InZombia. Directed by Rollo Jackson, the video follows the pair as they creep around a run-down motel. ace hood- “guess who” \nAce Hood returns with “Guess Who,” which follows his 2016 mixtape Body Bag 4. The song serves as his first offering of 2017 and features production from Murda Beatz. j.i.D- “shade 45 Freestyle” \nJ.Cole’s latest Dreamville Records signee, J.I.D, stopped by the Shade 45 studios to show off his lyrical prowess with an impromptu freestyle on DJ Tony Touch’s segment. The ATL representative did a decent job riding the beat of Outkast’s “Elevators (Me & You)” and made it clear why he’s one to watch. locksmith- “nobody” \nBay Area spitter Locksmith has been heavily on the grind since releasing The Lock Sessions project and picks back up with another new video, this time for “Nobody.” The black and white visual adds to the dramatic verbiage of the track, which revolves around the trials and tribulations of his life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:32:33.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
