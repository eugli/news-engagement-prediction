Now Clooney, who heretofore has not been responsible for more than a pet hog , is opening up about his reaction to impending first time fatherhood, particularly as the experience comes later in life for the actor. \nClooney was in France over the weekend and stopped by the French show Rencontres de Cinema . Ostensibly there to talk about the honor he received at the Caesar Awards, Clooney took the opportunity to break his silence and gush about the exciting development. \"We are really happy and really excited. It’s going to be an adventure,\" he said. The star, who is reportedly expecting one boy and one girl come spring, added, \"We’ve sort of embraced it all…with arms wide open.\" \nGeorge Clooney also shared an anecdote about how the surprising news went over with his \"very supportive\" friends. \"It got really quiet, and they all just started making baby crying noises. And the whole table just busted up laughing,\" he revealed. \nAs to how he's anticipating the particular challenges that will come with becoming a father in his 50s—Clooney is 55 now and will be 56 by the time the babies arrive—the actor is keeping his characteristic cool. He pointed to the likes of 89-year-old French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, who welcomed a child when he was 70, as proof that it can be done. \"So, I’m feeling a little better about being 56 by the time [they come],\" he said. And, hey, appropriate amount of panic aside, it's not like the silver fox has to worry about fatherhood turning him gray.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:17:41.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
