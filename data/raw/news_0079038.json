Well, even Hollywood's biggest stars are the same way when it comes to winning Oscars. After taking home the award for best actress for her role in La La Land on Sunday night, Emma Stone gave a breathless and heartfelt acceptance speech . But it wasn't until she got backstage that she really let her guard down. Brie Larson, who won the exact same award in 2016 for her role in Room , caught up with Emma shortly after her win to congratulate her. After Brie embraced Emma in an adorable hug, the two friends started crying over the happy moment. When they finally let each other go, they both wiped away their tears before walking away together. While we've been loving Emma's close bond with her costar and longtime friend, Ryan Gosling , we might have to shift our focus to be on this girl power a bit more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:09:08.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
