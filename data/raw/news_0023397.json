(HT Photo) \nThree-and-half-year-old Eva, a female Gull Terrier and a pet passport holder of France, was unable to keep her injured leg on the ground for the past three months as she suffered from anterior cruciate ligament rupture, a knee injury that is also common in football and hockey players. \nThe pet owner, 48 year-old NRI Sanjeev Kumar Jangwal, took her to a hospital in France where he learned about her knee injury. “The hospital staff told me that entire cost of the treatment will be 4,500 Euros. As treatment cost was too expensive in Paris, I decided to bring Eva to India,” said Jangwal. \nWhat followed is reportedly a rare case of veterinary tourism as Jangwal flew his pet all the way from Paris to Ludhiana, where it was successfully operated upon at a meagre cost of Rs 800 at Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), an amount almost negligible when compared with the proposed treatment cost in France. “The hospital staff in Paris told me that entire cost of the treatment will be 4,500 Euros. As treatment cost was too expensive, I decided to bring Eva to India,” pet owner Sanjeev Kumar Jangwal said. (Google maps) \nThe overall cost of treatment for a knee injury is nearly 4,500 Euros (around Rs 3.22 lakh) in France while the pet got the entire treatment in less than Rs 10,000 in India, including imported thread for stitching, medicines, surgery and other expenses. The travel expense of Eva is between Rs 50,000 and Rs 60,000, the pet owner said. \nJangwal, who belongs to Jalandhar, said: “Eva underwent the surgery on January 31 and is on course of recovery. I was surprised to know that the cost of surgery was just around Rs 800 in GADVASU.” \n“However, I faced some problems in bringing my pet to India as agents, who deal in arranging transportation of pets, created unnecessary hassles. Earlier, I had taken Eva to the US without any problem. The Indian government should also initiate steps to make the process easy so that foreigners can bring their pets here for treatment,” Jangwal said. \nAssociate professor at GADVASU Dr Arun Anand said Eva was suffering from a knee injury and such injuries are common in big-breed dogs. “The only cure for anterior ligament cruciate rupture was surgery. Stitches have been removed and Eva will be able to walk in 15 days,” he said. \nVice-Chancellor Dr AS Nanda said he see a big scope in veterinary tourism and wants to promote it. “We have trained faculty to deal with such cases. We are also running exchange programs with foreign universities,” said Nanda.
