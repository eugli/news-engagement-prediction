Mumbai: It is a known fact that Kamaal Rashid Khan often goes ranting about numerous films and people on Twitter and most of them choose to ignore him. But there are some celebrities like Ajay Devgn, who raised his voice against KRK during the ‘Shivaay’-‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ clash, and Vikram Bhatt, who had filed a defamation case against him for comments against an actress.\nBut there is a celebrity who didn’t take any such step and calmly conveyed her feelings towards KRK.\nKaran Johar, who KRK had claimed, had paid Rs 25 lakhs to speak positively about ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’, recently shared posters of Swara’s upcoming film ‘Anaarkali Aarah’. KRK replied to the post that the film will be 'super duper disaster of the year’.\nAnd Swara, who was going on a spree of retweeting all the tweets that had shared the posters, gave the most sarcastic reply one could think of. The actress, while calling KRK’s comments ‘unasked filth’ also called it a ‘compliment’ and a ‘character certificate’.\nThe reply, however, didn’t make any difference to him, who went on defending his comments.\nThis time, the actress chose the best option perhaps, of ignoring him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:15:39.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
