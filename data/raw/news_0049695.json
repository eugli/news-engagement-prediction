Williams, then in his twenties, was a key figure in the longest prison riot in British history. \nThe month of disruption started as a protest against poor conditions at Strangeways, and led to the authorities losing control of Manchester’s Victorian prison compound. \nEven after hundreds of prisoners surrendered following the first couple of days of disorder, a hardcore of rioters continued to stage a rooftop protest at the Southall Street jail.

He was later jailed for ten years for riot. And, in the years following his release, he was in and out of prison for burglaries committed to feed his heroin addiction. \nThen, in November 2015, he committed an act of shocking violence, stabbing Sian Roberts to death in a case which even the lead prosecutor described as ‘something of a whodunnit’. Glynn Williams during the Strangeways riot \nSian, 36, was a hairdresser who had grown up in Cheetham Hill. Bad relationships and family bereavements had led to her using heroin, and she knew Williams as a fixture in the local drug scene. \nWilliams denied Sian’s murder in Manchester Crown Court trial which ended last week, although he did not give evidence. \nThrough his barrister, throughout the hearing, he accused an innocent man, Joel Gordon, Sian’s former boyfriend, of having killed her. Read More How Williams was jailed for life for the murder of Sian Roberts \nMr Gordon was the perfect foil. He had served life for the 1997 knife murder of teenager Craig Pearse in Crumpsall, and reported finding Sian’s body to police on November 29. \nWhen officers got to the address they found a confusing scene. Handcuffs and a sex toy lay by Sian’s body, and a knife was lying across her left palm. View gallery \nThe killer had clearly attempted to throw investigators off the scent. But there were a number of clues that pointed to Glyn Williams being the real killer - including two full English breakfasts. \nOn the morning she was last seen - November 28 - Sian bought two English breakfasts from the Godfather cafe in Cheetham Hill before going back to St Helier’s Drive with Williams at around 10am, CCTV revealed.
