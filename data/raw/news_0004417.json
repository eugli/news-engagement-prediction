I still enjoy a cup of kopi-0 and bread for breakfast.\n“Perhaps, eating simple and healthy is my secret to good health,” she told reporters during the visit by Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng at her family home in Kuantan Road here yesterday.\nThe house also doubles up as a shop where her third son Koay Hock Soon, 71, is running a family business of making and selling tau sar pneah pastries and other types of traditional biscuits.\nBorn in 1914, life has not been easy for Gooi, whose family comprises 70 members.\nWhen she first came to Penang with her husband in 1937, she had to take on several odd jobs to help support her 10 children. Her husband was a trishaw rider.\nA grandson Koay Kai Hoe, 30, said she used to work as a matchmaker, a confinement lady and even a guard at a construction site.\n“Sometimes, she had to carry (one of) her children on her back while she worked. Both she and my grandfather had to move from one place to another before finally settling down here in Kuantan Road. \n“She has been living here for over 50 years,” said Kai Hoe, who is also helping in the family business.\nKai Hoe said his grandmother has more than 10 siblings, with some of them still living in China and Hong Kong.\n“She has visited them a few times in China and her last visit was when she was 92,” he said.\nKai Hoe said his grandmother has 10 children, of whom two daughters and a son had passed away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T11:10:38.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
