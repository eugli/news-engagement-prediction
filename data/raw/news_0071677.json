Transgender people hailed the step as victory for their civil rights. \nMr. Trump, a Republican who took office last month, rescinded those guidelines, even though they had been put on hold by a federal judge, arguing that states and public schools should have the authority to make their own decisions without federal interference. \nThe Justice and Education departments will continue to study the legal issues involved, according to the new, superseding guidance that will be sent to public schools. \nAbout 200 people gathered in front of the White House to protest against Mr. Trump's action, waving rainbow flags andchanting: “No hate, no fear, trans students are welcome here.” \nThe rainbow flag is the symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual andtransgender, or LGBT, people. \n“We all know that Donald Trump is a bully, but his attack ontransgender children today is a new low,” said Rachel Tiven, chief executive of Lambda Legal, which advocates for LGBT people. \nConservatives such as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whos pearheaded the lawsuit challenging the Obama guidance, hailed the Trump administration action. \n“Our fight over the bathroom directive has always been about former President Obama's attempt to bypass Congress and rewrite the laws to fit his political agenda for radical social change,\" said Mr. Paxton, a Republican. \nTransgender legal advocates have criticized the “states' rights” argument, saying federal law and civil rights are matters for the federal government to enforce, not the states. \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration was pressed to act now because of the pending U.S. Supreme Court case, G.G. versus Gloucester County School Board. \nThat case pits a Virginia transgender boy, Gavin Grimm, against officials who want to deny him use of the boys' room at his high school. \nAlthough the Justice Department is not a party in the case, it typically would want to make its views heard. The Trump administration action on Wednesday also withdrew an Education Department letter in support of Grimm's case. \n“I've faced my share of adversaries in rural Virginia. In ever imagined that my government would be one of them. We willnot be beaten down by this administration,” Grimm (17), told the protest outside the White House. \nCOURTS MAY HAVE FINAL SAY \nThe federal law in question, known as Title IX, bans sex discrimination in education. But it remains unsettled whether Title IX protections extend to a person's gender identity. \nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the Obama guidelines “did not contain sufficient legal analysis or explain how the interpretation was consistent with the language of Title IX.” \nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman vowed to ensure Title IX and his state's civil rights protections are enforced. \n“President Trump's decision to rescind anti-discrimination protections for transgender students is yet another cruel move by an administration committed to divisive policies that rollback the clock on civil rights,” he said in a statement. \nThe courts are likely to have the final say over whether Title IX covers transgender students. The Supreme Court could pass on that question in the Virginia case and allow lowercourts to weigh in, or go ahead and decide what the law means. \nObama's Education Department issued the guidance in responseto queries from school districts across the country about how to accommodate transgender students in gender-segregated bathrooms. \nIt also covered a host of other issues, such as theimportance of addressing transgender students by their preferrednames and pronouns and schools' responsibility to preventharassment and bullying of transgender children. \nThirteen states led by Texas sued to stop the Obamaguidelines, and a U.S. district judge in Texas temporarily halted their full implementation. \nThe White House previously boasted of Trump's support for LGBT rights, noting in a Jan. 31 statement that he was the first Republican presidential nominee to mention the community in his nomination acceptance speech. \n“Revoking the guidance shows that the president's promise toprotect LGBT rights was just empty rhetoric,” James Esseks, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT project,said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:43:47.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
