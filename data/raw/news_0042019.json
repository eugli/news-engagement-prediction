Barrio Cafe at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport was not closed because Esparza does not own it, she said.\nClosed. #DayWithoutImmigrants #Phoenix üá≤üáΩ @BARRIOCAFE1 @chefSILVANAphx pic.twitter.com/0w5OkXClG7 \n‚Äî Michael Edgecomb (@TheEdgePHX) February 16, 2017 Other Arizona restaurants that announced closures as part of the protest include Tres Leches Cafe and Mariscos Playa Hermosa in downtown Phoenix, Tortas El Manantial in Maryvale and Salsa Brava in Flagstaff.\nMore absences at schools In Phoenix Union High School District, some schools saw as much as a third of the student population not at school, according to spokesman Craig Pletenik.\nCamelback, Metro Tech, North and Trevor Browne high schools each had about 400 more absences Thursday than on a normal day, he said.\nMaryvale High School was up about 600 absences, Pletenik said, while Betty Fairfax and Cesar Chavez high schools in Laveen saw no meaningful difference. As of noon Thursday, there were no protests or walkouts on any campus, and no meaningful difference in staff and teacher attendance, he said.\n\"We didn‚Äôt want to promote it but we didn‚Äôt want to discount it, because we know for some of our kids it's an especially difficult time for them and their parents,\" Pletenik said. \"We respect the right of students for self-expression and peaceful protest but we also know school is the best and most productive place for all of our students to be.\"\nMesa High School senior Ivette Godinez tweeted a video showing that just half of her college-preparation class showed up Thursday.\n16 students showed up out of 32 students #DayWithoutImmigrants pic.twitter.com/9ZOdfv1NgV \n‚Äî Ivette Godinez (@iggodinez15) February 16, 2017 ‚ÄúI don't agree with students missing school but I do agree with people not showing up to work,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWithout these people, many business aren't going to make their sales or aren't going to get their work done. Many say, ‚ÄòThis is stupid and it's not the right way; it won't solve anything,‚Äô but then what is the right way? There's no right way. People are doing what they think is right.‚Äù\nSeveral schools in the Mesa Public Schools district also had higher than average student absenteeism, but employees attended work at the average rate, according to spokeswoman Helen Hollands.\nImpact on other businesses A handful of non-restaurant businesses posted that they also were closed in protest, including Jam Sports in Desert Sky Mall.\nLegends Event Center in Phoenix, which is a popular location for quincea√±eras, moved a planned open house from Thursday to next week in order to participate in the protest.\nPost by facebook . Tucson poet Enrique Garc√≠a Naranjo posted a thread of tweets explaining that even people who couldn't skip work or school could show solidarity by patronizing Mexican- or immigrant-owned businesses.\nI know some Mexican restaurants can't afford to close 2day, so I'm tipping good & eating well, to send em home early. #DayWithoutImmigrants \n‚Äî e. garc√≠a naranjo (@yungvat0) February 16, 2017 Check back for updates.
