Cooking class: (L-R) Calum Fuller, Dean Masters, Aldo Zilli and Abdul Lelo Ndambi \n“I was homeless at 16 when I left my home in Italy and moved to Munich,” he said. “I moved there because I lived in a fishing village where, in the winter, there was nothing to do and no jobs. \n“I had somewhere to go when I got there but, when I arrived, I was let down. It was a struggle at the beginning.” \nMr Zilli was homeless a “short amount of time” before getting a job in a kitchen – which sparked his interest in cooking.

Centrepoint resident interns at the Evening Standard \n“It is all about improving their lives, what they are doing and where they are living.\" \nAbdul Lelo Ndambi is one of the young Centrepoint residents who is taking part in the scheme. \nAfter being trained by Dean he has managed to get a placement at Mod Pizza in Leicester Square. Enthusiastic student: Abdul Lelo Ndambi with chef Aldo Zilli \n“Centrepoint gave me a lot of links which, if I was at home, I don’t believe I would have had,\" he said. \n“Right now I am just building the foundation but one day I would like to own a restaurant.” \nThe money raised by the Standard’s Young and Homeless helpline appeal will also help fund workshops like the one Abdul attends. \n“The helpline is great and will be good for young people who need it in the future,” he said. “It won’t be hard for them to get help straight away. \n“It would have been good for me because I would have had advice which would have made things easier. The extra support will be there for the kids in the future now and I am happy to see that.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:00:39.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
