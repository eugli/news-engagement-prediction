If it is difficult for you to stop yourself from raping someone, ask a trusted friend to accompany you at all times. \n4) Carry a rape whistle. If you find that you are about to rape someone, blow the whistle until someone comes to stop you. \n5) Don’t forget: honesty is the best policy. When asking someone out, don’t pretend that you are interested in them as a person. Tell them straight up that you expect to be raping them later. If you don’t communicate your intentions, they may take it as a sign that you do not plan to rape them. \nThe pamphlet adds at the bottom: ‘Rape culture directs women to police their clothing, beverage, behaviour and sexuality at all times to avoid men. It portrays men as powerless against their violent sexual urges. Rape culture demeans everyone and everyone should speak out against rape culture.’ \nIn March 2015, comedian Sarah Silverman shared this list of rape prevention tips .
