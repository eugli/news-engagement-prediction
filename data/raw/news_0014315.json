He has established a legion of fans and admirers within the music industry, when he hosted shows at Z-100 in New York, KIIS FM in Los Angeles and then back again at KTU in New York, and all becoming #1 in the Arbitron ratings in a short amount of time.Sean Hamilton always dreamed about becoming a Disc Jockey, and his dream started when he was six-teen years old and constructed an illegal pirate radio station in the basement of his parent's home. Sean admits 'I knew I wanted to pursue a career in this business when I caught the bug back then illegally, speaking to 6 people on a clear day. It was such a great feeling that I decided I wanted to speak to a few more.' When his pirate radio station was pulled off the air by the Federal Communications Commission he Immediately landed his first job in commercial radio in his hometown of Reno, Nevada. In 1990 New Line Cinema released a motion picture called 'Pump up the Volume' starring Christian Slater, which was loosely based on Sean's life.
