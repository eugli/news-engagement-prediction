He has never harmed a woman or a child, he was originally imprisoned for armed robbery in 1974. \n“He is no longer a violent offender but an artist. Yet he spends 22 hours a day in solitary confinement because of something that happened 17 years ago. \n“Without the chance to go back into the general population of a prison he cannot prove he is now safe to start his journey through rehabilitation to release. After all, isn’t that what our penal system is meant to also be about; rehabilitation?” 9 Paula has raved about her love for ‘Charlie’ and was seen visiting him this week \nShe adds: “Charlie’s parole hearing is coming up this year and I urge people to please sign and share this petition to allow Charlie to begin the process of working back through the penal system, both myself, Charlie and his supporters ask that he be taken off Segregation and transferred to a category A or B prison and reintroduced into general population. \n“Only then can he prove that he really is a changed man. We aren’t asking to open the door and release him, we are just realistically asking to allow him the same rights as other prisoners have.

What a bootiful bum.” \nThe portrait shows Bronson in a straight jacket and appearing to scream, with a mouse on his shoulder and a bird resting on his ear. \nHe also appears to be wearing a bandanna which has the word “Salvador”– the name Bronson prefers to go by – written on it. \nAbove his head are the words: “Born to love an angel.” \nThe prisoner, who was originally imprisoned for armed robbery but has had his sentence extended repeatedly due to prison violence, also writes in the piece: “I’m an artist, not a gangster.” \nThe former bare knuckle fighter proposed to Paula, who has appeared in Coronation Street and has played a stripper in Emmerdale , on Valentine’s Day. \nBronson, who is trying to reinvent his hardman image, also recently raised £1,650 for brave cancer battler Bradley Lowery, by getting pals of his to auction off other artwork. related stories FIGHT FOR OUR FREE PRESS Don't let the Government and rich celebs deny YOU a Press free to expose wrongdoing ART attack Britain’s most notorious inmate Charles Bronson paints colourful picture of his jail home to raise money for cancer tot Bradley Lowery NO HOLDS BARRED Three name changes, six world records, an award-winning artist and 41 years behind bars...
