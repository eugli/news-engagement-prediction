Euan Morton stars as Hedwig and Hannah Corneau stars as Yitzhak, Hedwig's beaten-down husband and assistant, in Hedwig and the Angry Inch, which continues through Feb. 12 at the Winspear Opera House. Jeffrey McWhorter/Special Contributor \nBut the first song, \"Tear Me Down,\" sets up the story, which is for mature audiences only, to perfection. As Hedwig, the extraordinary Euan Morton opens the rock concert show within a show as a failed star armored to the hilt with bitter glitter. Through the dark journey of his performance, which riffs with clever ad libs as his character flips from rage to purr to pain and possibility, Hedwig slowly sheds that armor, while the songs tell of a vulnerable gay youth growing up with a starry idea of love only to face disappointments, including a botched sex-change operation. \nWhile often described as genderqueer, Hedwig is a character who, for all the flamboyance, makes category seem irrelevant to the larger question of whether Hedwig can break through rejection, trauma and self-loathing to embrace the continual possibility of love. The musical began its life off-Broadway in 1998 with a book by John Cameron Mitchell and music and lyrics by Stephen Trask and received a fine regional production by Uptown Players in 2015. \nEuan Morton performs as Hedwig, a failed star armored to the hilt with bitter glitter. (Jeffrey McWhorter/Special Contributor) \nThe national tour pulls out the flashiest of bells and whistles including a wild light show, clever projections, dancing wigs and a program for Hurt Locker the Musical , supporting the storyline that Hedwig is performing on a set for a failed musical that hasn't yet been struck. The sharp onstage four-person band, \"The Angry Inch,\" offers witty, wordless commentary on the action. \nThe production pays homage to the Uptown Players show, even offering an exhibit of the costumes designed by Derek Whitener and Victor Brockwell in the lobby. Because here's the thing about Hedwig: It's not the kind of show that you see once and you're done. It's a story that changes with time and the actors that inhabit Hedwig and Hedwig's beaten-down husband and assistant, Yitzhak, poignantly played by Hannah Corneau as a former drag queen who has given up the spotlight and beloved wigs at Hedwig's insistence. ‘Hedwig’ a rousing, rock ‘n’ roll journey at Uptown Players \nAs the national conversation turns to walls, Hedwig provides subtle, pointed notes on that, too. Hedwig grows up in post-World War II East Berlin when there was a wall between East and West Berlin. The wall serves as a metaphor for all that keeps people apart, with a particular emphasis on walls that keep apart those who are meant to be together as two parts of a whole. \nThe dig about the failed musical, Hurt Locker , reminds us it's also very much about how hurt can distract us from seeing love that's in plain sight. Those who have been walled off create walls, perhaps for revenge or maybe because they're the only way we know how to live. Hedwig's journey is a universal one that reminds us that \"The Origin of Love,\" to quote one of his songs, is when we let ourselves and others be who they truly are.
