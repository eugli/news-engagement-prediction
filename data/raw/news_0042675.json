Keri saw that almost instantly,” Royce wrote in a Facebook post last week that has since been shared thousands of times.\nRoyce, a writer, said that his wife has proven her strength numerous times during their eight-year marriage, but that this time he was most impressed.\n“It hit me that not only am I married to my very best friend, but to a truly remarkable, special human being,” he said.\nHis wife was also very public about the difficult decision to go through with the birth, something she’s grappled with even though she is pro-life.\nClick for more from The New York Post.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fkeridyoung%2Fposts%2F10104623234732427&width=500", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fkeridyoung%2Fposts%2F10104872288097487&width=500", "https://www.facebook.com/ryoung?pnref=story", "http://www.nypost.com/", "http://nypost.com/2017/02/21/mom-will-give-birth-to-terminally-ill-daughter-to-donate-her-organs/"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:14:38.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
