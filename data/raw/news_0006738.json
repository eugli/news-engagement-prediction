The edict also shut U.S. borders to refugees. \nTrump’s edict erased $3.75 billion in market value from five major U.S. carriers Monday, as concern that the U.S. restrictions would expand or spark retaliation by other nations pushed a Standard & Poor’s airline index to the biggest tumble in four months. After that drop of 2.9 percent, the index extended declines Tuesday with a slide of 1.9 percent at 12:58 p.m. in New York. Two Tweets \nIn two Twitter messages Monday, Trump said “big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage, protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer.” That was a reference to Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, who called the travel ban an “evil order.” \nDelta canceled more than 100 flights that day as it recovered from a computer breakdown the night before. The systems fault began about 6:30 p.m. on Sunday. Delta didn’t comment on Trump’s tweet about the service disruption. \nAdministration officials grappled with fallout from Trump’s order over the weekend, clarifying on Sunday that it didn’t apply to holders of so-called green cards and moving to mitigate the effect on Iraqis who have worked with the U.S. Chief executives at many of nation’s largest companies warned of business disruptions. \nThe International Air Transport Association, which represents airlines, asked the U.S. government to clarify aspects of Trump’s executive order. The trade group also urged all governments to provide advance coordination of changes in border-entry requirements for passengers. Additional Burdens \n“The EO was issued without prior coordination or warning, causing confusion among both airlines and travelers,” IATA said in a statement Monday. “It also placed additional burdens on airlines to comply with unclear requirements, to bear implementation costs and to face potential penalties for non-compliance.” \nThe Association of Flight Attendants-CWA called on the Department of Homeland Security to exempt attendants from the executive order. Without that, employees from the affected countries could be barred from re-entering the U.S. after working on international flights. \n“Despite the enhanced government security clearance flight attendants are required to obtain before working for a U.S. airline, this arbitrary and sudden EO will cause the loss of good, well-paying American jobs,” the union said in a letter to the agency. “The implementation of this action is different than anything we have seen.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T07:43:13.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
