Presenting to the world, courtesy of the Bharatiya Janta Party: Alternative-history. According to a report in The Indian Express , three senior ministers of the Vasundhara Raje government have backed a proposal to rewrite history. This proposal suggests altering what is being taught at the university level; quite specifically about the Rajput ruler Maharana Pratap. \nAccording to Satish Chandra’s Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals - Mughal Empire , the Battle of Haldighati, fought between the forces of Akbar led by Man Singh and those of Maharana Pratap, assisted by an Afghan contingent led by Hakim Sur, failed to break the stalemate. The battle, Chandra notes, can neither be considered a struggle between Hindus and Muslims, nor be considered a struggle for Rajput independence. Original historical photograph. Not Photoshopped at all. [Photo: DailyO] But the proposal backed by former higher education minister (presently health minister) Kalicharan Saraf, school education minister Vasudev Devnani, and urban development and housing minister Rajpal Singh Shekhawat suggests rewriting it to fit a thoroughly different narrative. According to their proposal, Maharana Pratap won the Battle of Haldighati against the Mughal army of Akbar. As per Kalicharan Saraf, Akbar was a foreign invader, and Maharana Pratap actually won the battle. “Yes, it has been established. A distorted version of history has been taught to generations of students. But the fact is that Akbar was a foreign invader and Maharana Pratap was a brave, patriotic ruler. And if there is a proposal to correct this mistake and tell students that Maharana Pratap actually won the battle, then what is wrong with it?” Saraf told The Indian Express . Alt-history, ladies and gentlemen. But perhaps, there is some truth to the BJP version of history. A little shallow digging on Google revealed a well-documented series of photographs that prove that Maharana Paratap did indeed win the battle and it is the liberal media and anti-national, pro-Mughal pseudo-historians who gave us the wrong version of history. We present to you a list of photos that provide nothing but damning evidence against the secular narrative provided by historians in India.
