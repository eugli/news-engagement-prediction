Man lost a bet so downed a litre of vodka in 40 seconds \nThe substitute teacher, who worked at Washington High School, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, also sent the boy X-rated photos of herself. \n‘We had sex – almost daily – in his car, my car, his mom’s house, and his dad’s house,’ she told Dr Phil in October. \nHaglin, who became ‘Bambi’ the lap dancer after she was sacked, initially said the pupil was the one who seduced her and she was the victim. \nMORE: This guy hilariously trolls people who ask for their photos to be edited Mary Beth Haglin sent sexy snaps to the pupil (Picture: Facebook) \nShe claimed she tried to break up with him but he said he would tell people about the affair if she did. \n‘He did so with such intelligence and such an elevated vocabulary that I was completely duped by the whole facade,’ she added. \nBut District Judge Kevin McKeever didn’t buy her defence and convicted her of sexual exploitation of a student. She was jailed for 90 days (Picture: KCRG) She became a lap dancer after quitting her job (Picture: KCRG) \nHe handed Haglin a 360 day term on Friday but she will only serve 90 days after he suspended part of the sentence. \nJudge McKeever added: ‘Any violations of that section of terms of probation could result in additional consequences including an extension of the parole period or a revocation of parole.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T19:44:18.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
