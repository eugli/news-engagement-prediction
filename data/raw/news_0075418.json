Diners at the Ibis hotel in Luton, Bedfordshire, were horrified when they noticed First Group director Michael Barker, 58, had been handcuffed to his chair by his female companion. A court heard the pair also made 'spanking' gestures with a metal ruler and the woman, believed to be a sex worker, then groped Barker beneath the table before producing a beaker. They then went to the toilets together 'four or five times'. The pair were arrested and led away in handcuffs after their fellow diners complained about their behaviour to police. Barker has now admitted outraging public decency. He also quit First Group shortly before his appearance in court.
