Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFootball hero David Beckham has called in cops over fears 'more embarrassing revelations will leak including BANTER with mates'. \nThe ex-England captain is still reeling from the details of angry emails between him and his advisers becoming public knowledge on Friday - dubbed 'The Beckileaks'. \nThe messages - which were revealed on a website called Football Leaks and published by media in Europe - accompanied by reports that Beckham 'carried out charity work in a bid to earn a knighthood'. \nIn a foul-mouthed outburst it is said that he called the Honours Committee \"unappreciative c****\" - and allegedly slammed other stars getting awards. \nAnd the reports claimed that the Unicef ambassador 'demanded the charity pay for a business-class flight for him to attend an event - to which he took a private jet'. \nWhile still to comment publicly, in an attempt to pour cold water on the revelations yesterday, Beckham insisted through friends he was simply a \"normal person\" who was just \"extremely disappointed\" at being passed over for a knighthood.

He gets very passionate about his work and particularly about his country, Great Britain. That’s what drives him. \n\"He spent a lot of time and effort getting the London Olympics to the UK which had such a positive effect on so many people, but for it not to be acknowledged made him very emotional. Who wouldn’t be?\" \nAs 'Brand Beckham' crumbles, today the ex-Manchester United legend is reportedly scared of more leaks - \"conversations between him and his PR Simon Oliveira and best pal Dave Gardner \" - which it's feared could further tarnish his reputation.

They share pretty much everything. \n“David is also very close to Oliveira, who has been with him for years and been instrumental in building up his brand.

It has gone right to the top. \n“They have confirmed they are investigating a serious case of football leaks, without actually naming Beckham.

It has gone right to the top. \n“They have confirmed they are investigating a serious case of football leaks, without actually naming Beckham. \n“But the feeling is that they have spoken to Beckham’s people and they are very keen to get to the bottom of this and find the hacker.” \nBeckham - who has donated more than £1m to Unicef - denies he used his charity work as part of a conscious effort to win an honour. \nGood Morning Britain host Piers Morgan wrote on Twitter: \"Oh. My. God. RIP Brand Beckham.... \n\"Nobody will be envious of David Beckham by tomorrow. They will be sickened by him.\" \nHe later added: \"We can forget about 'Sir David Beckham' ever happening.\" 'The Beckileaks' emails with PR man Simon Oliveira : \nBeckham on the Honours Committee: \n\"They’re a bunch of c**** I expected nothing less... Who decides on the honors? (sic) It’s a disgrace to be honest and if I was American I would of (sic) got something like this 10 years ago... It’s p****d me off those old unappreciative c****.\" \nBeckham to Oliveira: \n\"Katherine Jenkins OBE for what? Singing at the rugby and going to see the troops plus admitting to taking coke… F joke and if you get asked we should think of a cutting remark.\" \nOliveira to Beckham: \n\"My honest advice to you is that we should not do anything that jeopardises it and remain positive… Why waste time on a cutting remark as that will only rile the committee? We need to remain dignified if asked but if you want me to work up something cutting I will work up one but my advice is it’s not productive.\" \nBeckham to Oliveira: \n\"I agree but it’s p****d me off those old unappreciative c****.\" \nBeckham on suggestions that he should put $1 million into a Unicef dinner: \n\"I don’t want to put my personal money into this cause… To pour this million into the fund is like putting my own money in. If there was no fund, the money would be for me.
