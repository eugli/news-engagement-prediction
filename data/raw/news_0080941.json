Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nA couple of weeks ago, a student activist group at Howard University called Concerned Students 1867 issued a list of demands, including that President Donald Trump be banned from all campus buildings and that the university provide students full disclosure of any interaction between school administrators and the Trump administration. [CAMPUS] ICYMI: Concerned Students Issue Demands to Howard University and President Frederick https://t.co/bYkDVCWTth \n— The Hilltop (@TheHilltopHU) February 26, 2017 \nTrump and Vice President Mike Pence had quite a bit of interaction with administrators from historically black colleges Monday, and the news was good for the educators. Through an executive order, Trump means to strengthen the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities and move its office into the White House. Pres Trump welcomes officials from Historically Black Colleges & Universities into the Oval Office. Plans to issue Exec Order on HBCUs. pic.twitter.com/prx4jJNokX \n— Mark Knoller (@markknoller) February 27, 2017 Great move by President Trump to increase support for HBCUs https://t.co/dElUzXV7w7 \n— Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) February 28, 2017 Trump has decided to move the WH Office on HBCUs into the West Wing. \nMcClatchy DC reports: \nThe potential is huge. Federal agencies have thousands of contracts with colleges, universities and think tanks worth billions of dollars, primarily for research that includes studying everything from cancer to poverty. \n“It would be truly, truly historic,” said Leonard Haynes, a longtime educator who ran the office and is helping to write the executive order. “It’s part of a long time dream…none of (the other presidents) had the courage to do it.” \nNot surprisingly, the members of Concerned Students 1867 and others weren’t pleased that Howard University President Wayne A.I. Frederick would agree to meet with Trump and Pence, regardless. Pres. Wayne A.I. Frederick will be meeting with Mike Pence at the White House today. pic.twitter.com/ieMpcIfPyG ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:52:17.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
