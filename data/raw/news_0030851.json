(Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWill Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor really get it on? \nMoney talks, and no one expresses his love for cash more than Mayweather, the retired former champ. He also knows a matchup with McGregor is \"easy work,\" as he likes to say. That's because any fight between the two will be in a boxing ring with eight-ounce gloves, not a UFC octagon. \nAlthough the fight has not been finalized, both men continue to talk it up, and there were news media reports from around the globe on Tuesday, including Mayweather telling ESPN, \"we're getting very, very close,\" that negotiations are progressing. \nWith that in mind, here are nine questions about the potential superfight. 1. What will it take to consummate the fight? \nA lot. Both fighters have massive egos, and even trivial things, such as who comes out last and who is billed as the A-side, will be contested. \nOf course, it all comes down to money, and the purse split will be a nightmare to squabble over. UFC president Dana White offered Mayweather a $25 million flat guarantee, which caused Mayweather to say \"he's a comedian.\" In this instance, Mayweather is right to be insulted. \nHIs fight with Manny Pacquiao, the richest in history, netted him more than $200 million. Surely a fight with McGregor is worth more than an eighth of that. If the fight is going to get done, Mayweather is going to want at least 60% of the pie, the same deal he had for the Pacquiao bout. \nBut there are two other massive issues. See below. 2. Will White allow McGregor to participate? \nMcGregor swears he'll fight Mayweather with or without the UFC's backing, but it's not that simple. McGregor is under contract to the UFC and has four fights remaining on his deal. White isn't about to stand on the sideline when there's cash to be made. \nPlus, if Mayweather embarrasses McGregor in the ring, the UFC's lone remaining cash cow returns to the octagon perhaps with his marketability damaged. 3. Will a state athletic commission sanction the bout? \nMcGregor already holds a boxing license in California and is attempting to gain one in Nevada, where he has some issues to clean up following a water-bottle incident with Nate Diaz. \nSimply holding a boxing license doesn't mean you're sanctioned for any fight. McGregor has never competed in a boxing ring — pro or amateur — outside of sparring sessions. In his most highly publicized workout, fringe contender Chris Van Heerden toyed with McGregor. \nSure, McGregor is an incredible mixed martial arts fighter, and his stand-up game is strong for the UFC ranks. But boxers are masters of one particular style of fighting, not jacks of all trades. \nIt's hard to see a top commission such as Nevada or California allowing a fighter in his pro boxing debut to face an all-time great. But money could solve this problem. \nAnd even if one of those states won't approve it, there are plenty of places that will. When Mike Tyson lost his boxing license in Nevada after the leg-biting incident with Lennox Lewis, they were forced to bring the heavyweight championship bout to Memphis. 4. When and where would the fight take place? \nIt's likely everybody prefers Las Vegas but that might not happen for reasons listed above. Outside of places such as Memphis and New Orleans, there are also international options. What about Belfast? Or maybe even Dubai, where money is no object. \nAs for the timing, the fall makes the most sense. September, October and November are generally reserved for big fights. Mayweather also will have to work his way into boxing shape after his last fight in September 2015, while McGregor would need a lengthy camp dedicated to boxing before even he begins the actual training period. 5. What kind of fighting shape do we believe Mayweather to be in? \n\"Money\" retired following his 49th victory, a shutout decision over Andre Berto in 2015. Mayweather is revered for his conditioning and stamina. During recent public appearances, the soon-to-be 40-year-old looked to be in great shape. And with a big fight on the line, there's little doubt he would work his way into tip-top fighting condition. 6. How much do they stand to make? \nHundreds of millions, depending on how many pay-per-view buys the fight generates. Mayweather-Pacquiao sold 4.6 million pay-per-views, which shattered the previous record of 2.8 million set by Oscar De La Hoya and Mayweather. \nIf this fight generates 3 million, both men stand to make hundreds of millions. The gate, too, plays into their purses, and filling up T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas would bring a large one. 7. What weight would the fight take place at? \nMayweather last competed at 147 pounds, but also has fought at 154. Mayweather said that McGregor told him he would want the fight possibly at 150, which is doable. McGregor competes at lightweight, with a weight limit of 154 pounds. 8. Who would televise it? \nMayweather insisted last month that if the fight takes place, Showtime would distribute the fight on PPV. Mayweather fought on HBO for a long time, but signed a six-fight deal with Showtime in 2013. \nWhite surely will want UFC to own the rights. Could a partnership be worked out where they share rights? This has happened twice between HBO and Showtime for Mayweather-Pacquiao and Lewis-Tyson fights. 9. Who wins? \nThis one is easy. Mayweather wins in a laugher. That's no disrespect to McGregor, an elite UFC fighter who surely would wipe the floor with Mayweather in the octagon. But this is boxing, and Mayweather is perhaps the greatest fighter of this era. \nIt's difficult to fathom the Irishman winning a single round. The biggest drama would likely come from seeing if Mayweather can score a knockout.
