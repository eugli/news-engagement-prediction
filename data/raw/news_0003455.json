Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times President Trump is settling into life at the White House , which is well-stocked with his favorite foods. The city’s restaurateurs are curious to see if the president, who is a homebody compared with his restaurant-hopping predecessor, will show any desire to engage with a culinary scene that became vibrant during the Obama administration. We asked a group of chefs, general managers and restaurateurs to give their recommendations for the commander in chief. Try some (more) steak. \n“I was happy to see him when he went to Jean-Georges with Mitt Romney and he had the scallops on the table. I know he likes his steak well-done. 701 would be good for him.” — Ashok Bajaj , whose Knightsbridge Restaurant Group operates several eateries, including the Bombay Club, 701 Restaurant and Rasika. \nTry some fancy chicken. \n“One of my favorites that could fit in with the president is called Memphis Raines. It’s a hand-breaded chicken cutlet that we dip in hot sauce. It’s the best dressed-up buffalo chicken cutlet you’ve ever had.” — Casey Taylor Patten , the founder of the Washington-based hoagie chain Taylor Gourmet, who noted Mr. Trump’s fondness for fried chicken. Try some menu classics. \n“We have some of our staple items from the very beginning. Our braised short rib was on the menu from Day 1. I don’t think we would change it based on our clientele.” — Joseph Cerione , the general manager of Blue Duck Tavern, who also praised the bone marrow appetizer and an “Americanized” version of Peking duck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:39:29.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
