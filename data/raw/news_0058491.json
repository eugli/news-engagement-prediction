Ask for a receipt Shutterstock \nA former London McDonald’s employee wrote in a Quora thread that during certain hours there are customers who’ve been paid to go and rate their experience. They always ask for a receipt so they can get the meal reimbursed. \nThe user said these periods, referred to as “Gapbuster Times,” are typically 12-2 p.m. and 5-7 p.m. Employees are urged to be on the lookout for these mystery customers. \nIt never hurts to have an employee think you’re there to secretly give them a score. So if you’re picking up a quick lunch or dinner, ask for a receipt to ensure the best service and freshest quality. 2. Get the cheap Big Mac McDonald’s McDouble \nDon’t have $3.99 to splurge on the McDonald’s signature dish? This life hack, hailed as the poor man’s Big Mac, gets you the same taste for half the price. \nOrder the McDouble ($1.39) without ketchup and mustard, but add Mac Sauce and lettuce. It’s the same thing, minus the middle bun. \n“Shoot you can order three and still be under-budget from a solitary Big Mac,” wrote a former employee on Quora. He added you might be charged for the lettuce. 3.Order four-piece Chicken McNuggets Shutterstock \nOne box of four-piece box of McNuggets is only $1.19, whereas a 10-piece box is $4.29. So three four-piece boxes will get you 12 McNuggets and save you 72 cents. But for the best bargain, order the 20-piece box, with 20 nuggets for $4.99. \nWho ever only ate four McNuggets anyway? 4. Hold the pickles Shutterstock \nYour burger is more likely to get grilled on the spot if you ask for it without pickles, sauce or onions — just pick one. The deviation from the standard “works” setup will force the restaurant to make a new burger for you. \nOne person who claimed to be a former employee wrote on Quora that – for example – you order a Quarter Pounder without pickles, the cook will grill up a new a patty. \n“The difference between a burger that’s sitting for who knows how long and one right off the grill is phenomenal,” the user wrote. \nAnother user wrote that you can also just ask for a burger “fresh,” and they’ll grill a new one. The same user added that workers usually don’t mind this request because it lets them slow down for a second. \nEither way, you might have to wait an extra five minutes (or 10-15 during busy times) if you prefer your Big Mac fresh. 5. Double the dessert Shutterstock \nCombine these McD classics for a sweeter finish. Order the Hotcakes and a Fruit ‘N Yogurt Parfait, then fold the Parfait into the Hotcakes for a “McCrepe” Order their apple pie and a McFlurry and ask the server to blend in a piece of the pie. Order a chocolate, vanilla and strawberry milkshake blend for a Neapolitan Shake. Finally, order the Hot Caramel Sundae and ask your server to top it off with apple slices. 6. Ask for fresh fries Shutterstock \nOrdering fries without salt will get you a fresh batch, but this is an order that’ll make you that customer. \n“This is true but also a pain in the ass,” one former employee wrote of the advice floating around to get unsalted fries. “The fry person will need to wipe down the station, the fry scoop, and clear the area for the new batch to keep salt from contaminating the new batch.” \nJust like the burger, the user wrote that all you have to do is ask for “fresh fries.” Again, you’ll be waiting a few extra minutes, but you’ll get the latest batch. \nA different user wrote that the “fresh” trick also works for ordering Filet-O-Fish, without cheese. 7. Order the “round” eggs Shutterstock \nFor the best breakfast, order a “round egg” on your non-McMuffin breakfast sandwich. \nA Quora user, and former McDonald’s employee, wrote that the “round egg” is “definitely the best egg we have (and definitely real!)” \nThis magical egg is poached, and it’s cracked and cooked in a ring on the spot. McD’s other egg “forms” are a folded scrambled egg patty which is made from a powdered mix, and scrambled eggs that are used in the breakfast burrito. But, you can ask for the round egg to be used in any sandwich. \nThe user, a self-proclaimed “poor high school girl working at McDonald’s on the side,” recommended asking for it on the bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit/bagel. 8. Ask for a steamed bun WikiCommons \nAccording to web intel, the McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish sandwich is served with a different bun than the rest of their menu. \nIt’s lighter, it’s fluffier, it’s….steamed. \nThe airy bun makes the fried fish and tartar sauce taste like, not fast food. And you can substitute the regular, old toasted sesame bun for a steamed bun on any sandwich. 9. Skip the grilled chicken McDonald’s Artisan grilled chicken sandwich. \nIn 2015 one Reddit user who claimed to be a McDonald’s manager held an AMA. In addition to confirming that “grill orders” will get you a fresh patty, he cautioned against ordering one menu item in particular. \n“DON’T order… the grilled chicken.” he wrote. “It’s horrible frozen chicken that we defrost and steam and it’s a bit gelatinous.” \nLuckily, with options like the McGangBang, you shouldn’t have to.
