As a result, I was remanded for five days and was detained at the Shah Alam police headquarters. \n\"This, I believe, has tarnished the name of the party and its leadership, especially in Selangor. \n\"As someone who loves the party, I take full responsibility over my actions and would like to resign from my posts. I will adhere to any decision made by the party,\" he said in the letter dated Feb 7. \nHe then shared several photos of him speaking to Noh in Putrajaya, however, did not divulge details of their conversation. \nJamal was arrested with nine of his friends on Feb 2 for trespassing into gambling dens around Selangor. \nFollowing his release on Monday, Jamal announced his intention to resign from Umno, stressing that it was for the sake of the party. \nHundreds of his supporters however turned up at his home on Tuesday, urging him to not give up his posts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T13:19:44.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
