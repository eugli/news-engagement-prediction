GETTY SNP ministers were taking a car journey, that only takes 10 minutes to walk on foot Last month the Scottish Government unveiled a blueprint to slash greenhouse gas emissions by two-thirds over the next 15 years. Ministers believe tackling city and town centre road pollution will help to cut them by 66 per cent by 2032. In September it was revealed ministers made almost 100 journeys of half a mile or less in official cars. The most frequent route was between St Andrew's House and the Scottish Parliament, despite the fact it only takes around 10 minutes to walk between the two buildings. GETTY Journeys of half a mile or less were often taken in official cars John O'Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance: \"Scottish ministers will sometimes need official travel so that they can work on confidential documents in a secure environment but that doesn't mean that chauffeur-driven cars should be used as a matter of course. \"There are other, cheaper modes of transport that could be used when travelling securely isn't a necessity, which would save a lot of taxpayers' cash. \"All areas of the public sector should be looking for savings and government ministers should not be exempt from these expectations.\" The Scottish Government said it \"continually looks for ways to minimise\" the use of official cars. A spokeswoman added: “Maintenance costs have reduced by over 30 per cent and travel and subsistence by 75 per cent. We are on track to deliver savings on vehicle hire this year. \"We are committed to leading by example on tackling climate change and reducing carbon emissions, and constantly review the make-up of the fleet to ensure it is as environmentally sustainable as possible.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:10:09.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
