He took Tk 5,000 and Tk 3000 in cash from them. \nIt was found that the bribe-taker is Obaidur Rahman, a sub-inspector (SI) of the police's Criminal Investigation Department (CID). He went to investigate a case relating to alleged abduction of a four-and-half-year-old child in Savar's Ashulia. \nOne of the persons from whom the CID officer took money has been identified as Md Masum who is also an accused in the case. \nThe missing child was named as Shawon who was abducted from the Ashulia of Savar more than a year ago, according to his father's statement. \nWhen contacted, the accused Masum said, Obaidur used to take money threatening him that he would be awarded with 'capital punishment' in the case. \nThe investigation officer has already taken as much as Tk 222,000 from him, Masum alleged. \nWhen the CID official was reached over phone, he confirmed his identity. But once As Prothom Alo reporter induced him, the CID official cut off the phone call saying, \"It's a wrong number.\" He even did not reply to any SMS sent to him. \nWhen contacted, the Dhaka division special police superintendent Abu Sufian confirmed that this number belongs to SI Obaidur Rahman. \nAsked about the video clips that showed Obaidur Rahman taking money from two men, CID Dhaka division assistant police superintendent Khorshed Alam said the money-taker is SI Obaidur Rahman who is an investigation officer in a case filed with Ashulia police station on 12 March 2016 over abduction of a child. According to the victims' father Sheikh Sumon, Shawon went to play at a nearby field behind the Purbadhania Starling Garments factory on 20 December 2015, but he did not return home. \n\"The neighbour Shawon and his associates abducted my child and kept him in an unknown place,\" Sheikh Sumon alleged. \n\n* This report, originally published in Prothom Alo Bangla print edition, has been rewritten in English by Toriqul Islam.
