Suddenly Kai Parker pops up in The Grill in Mystic Falls, having escaped from hell. Except, wait, Kai can’t taste or feel anything. Still, he can siphon magic and can definitely kill people. (Sorry, waiter.) \n\nAs Kai explains in present day to Alaric and Damon , it seems he’s stuck between worlds, nether in or out of hell and life. \nDuh, Alaric isn’t too pleased to see his potential brother-in-law, who killed Jo, but Kai still wants to strike a deal: Find a way to get him out of hell for real and Kai will help them kill Cade. Oh, and he’ll bring back Elena , too. \nThere’s more drama across town, though. Matt and Caroline realize that, when Stefan turned human, everyone he compelled got their memories back, and now he’s wanted for some blood-sucking crimes. \nCaroline cleans up Stefan’s mess by re-compelling them and sending them money, but all her fiancé’s bad deeds are definitely getting to her. \nOne of those people who remembers is Stefan’s kidnapper, who finally shows his face: It’s Dorian Williams, Alaric’s assistant. Turns out, years ago, Stefan killed his father and sister, Ripper-style. \nHe compelled Dorian to believe they instead died in a fire. \nStefan apologizes, but a gun-wielding Dorian won’t hear it. Instead, he makes Stefan dig a grave. \nAnd then he shoots him. \nMeanwhile, magic-less Bonnie is trying to reach Enzo in hell, but she’s having no luck. Damon interrupts, hoping Bonnie’s hell-escaping solution would work for Kai. He uses the “breaking her and Elena’s soul bond” excuse, so Bonnie clearly realizes dead Kai is back in all our lives. \nShe realizes there’s only one person who can help all of them: Cade himself. \nKai’s nose starts bleeding, and it’s clear there’s a ticking clock on how long he can stay out of hell, meaning their biggest chance of killing the devil and saving Elena . \n“I can’t go back there. You’re on fire all the time, ghosts from your past come back to pull your skin off, and occasionally on really bad days you come face-to-face with Cade, who is literally torture incarnate,” Kai says. It becomes overwhelmingly clear why everyone is trying to stay out of hell. \n(Tears for our man Enzo!) \n\nKai decides maybe he can save himself from going back by feeding Cade with the soul of a truly evil person. Luckily, right there in the Grill, there’s a totally horrible, sexist cook, and they set their sights on him. \nDouble luckily, Dorian has a crisis of conscience and tries to help the Salvatore brother. He calls Matt to tell him what he did, but Caroline overhears first and takes off to find her love. \nAlaric and his girls are hunkered down at the Armory, but Alaric tells Caroline he wants to bring them home to see Caroline because, whuh oh, it seems the Gemini twin magic is starting to emerge. \n\nMeanwhile with Bonnie, things just got real. She approaches Cade at a coffee shop and straight-up asks how to get Enzo out of hell. Cade tells her to ask him herself. As we suspected, Bonnie’s tragic event (which one, are we right?) awakened new powers. \nAs Bonnie remembers Enzo dying needlessly at the hands of her friend, she is transported to their burned-down cabin, and Enzo is there. OMG. \nAfter a hug and a kiss, Enzo warns Bonnie not to trust Cade — that he’s not in hell, but Cade is trying to bring him there. Back in the coffee shop, Bonnie lies to Cade and says she didn’t see Enzo. \nSorry, but Cade is the legit devil and he doesn’t believe it. He tells Bonnie her scream at the moment of Enzo’s death opened up another dimension (similar to the prison world), where Enzo is hiding. \nIt’s just like when Cade made hell, because Bonnie is a badass. \nWhen Cade reads Bonnie’s mind, he finds out Kai Parker is out of hell , too. \nThere’s more bad news. Stefan passes out, still in the woods with Dorian, when Caroline arrives. In this state, Stefan sees Cade, who tells him he is dying, and that he because he is already destined for hell, he should release Caroline from his burden and just die already. \nThankfully, Stefan doesn’t agree and wakes up. \nStill, Dorian can’t accept that he almost killed a man. Stefan realized this would be the case, and gets Matt to give Dorian all of the case files and evidence against Stefan, going back years. If Dorian wants him in jail, it’s quite literally in his hands. \nDamon knows Cade is coming for Kai, so he has a new plan: Find a way to redeem Kai so he won’t belong in hell anymore. (Um, we think that Damon hopes this for himself, too, right?) \nThe redemption? Bring Elena Gilbert back to life , now. \nCaroline goes to find Stefan in the hospital, and he’ll make a full recovery. However, it’s not clear that his guilty conscience will ever make a full recovery, because he decides he wants to move on and leave Mystic Falls. \nAlone. \nNow that Bonnie knows her full powers, she again tries to reach Enzo. And she does, even though he’s not fully “there.” We’re all crying as she hugs Enzo and says, “never leave me again.” \nElsewhere, Alaric shows up to Caroline’s house with the twins, Izzie and Josie . The happy reunion is cut short when Izzie grabs Caroline’s arm and accidentally siphons from her. Josie responds by trying to do a spell on Izzie. \nThings are clearly out of control with the newest Gemini twins. \n\nMeanwhile, Gemini twin Kai and Damon go to Elena’s casket. But Kai doesn’t intend to wake Elena. He siphons from Damon instead. \n“I’ve been in hell long enough to know there’s no such thing as redemption, “Kai says. “There are only promises and bargains and tricks we play on ourselves to make us believe we are good people.” \n“I’m not a good person, and if I go down, I’m going out with a bang.” \nAnd he makes Elena’s casket disappear, while Damon falls to the ground. \nThe Vampire Diaries Season 8 airs Fridays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint ’s coverage of The Vampire Diaries Season 8 below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T07:09:30.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
