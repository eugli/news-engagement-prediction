DOMINICO ZAPATA/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe 20 people were rafting down the Waikato River. \nThere was no immediate concern for the rafters' safety. They were being monitored by a police officer who got aboard a person's boat, he said. \n\"Looks like most were drifting towards the bank at the Pukete boat ramp, north of Church Road.\" \nMalcolmson said most if not all of the rafters, aged between 18 and 50, managed to make it to the shore unaided. \nThey swam to the side and scrambled out of the shallow water on to the riverbank. \n\"The next thing is to go and rescue the raft,\" Malcolmson said. \nLeaving it posed a hazard to any other river users, he said. \nAt 4.30pm, police were seen to be towing in a large raft consisting of a trampoline and basketball hoop to the side of the river. \nA scattering of people remained on board. \nThere were a number of smaller rafts attached to the craft by rope. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T11:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:05:23.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
