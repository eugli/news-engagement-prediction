NOKIA Nokia is reportedly preparing to introduce a new version of the iconic Nokia 3310 \nThe refreshed version of the Nokia 3310 (which we can only hope will ship with a copy of Snake II preinstalled) is expected to cost set customers back about €59 (roughly £50). \nThe budget mobile phone is rumoured to be announced at the Mobile World Congress tradeshow in Barcelona on February 26th. \nNews of the latest Nokia announcements comes from renown leaker Evan Blass, aka Evleaks, who claims to have contacted someone briefed with the Finnish company's plans. \nAlongside the revamped Nokia 3310, tipster Evan Blass claims that HMD Global – the company behind the Nokia brand – will also announce a new flagship smartphone. \nDubbed Nokia P1, the new smartphone will purportedly run the latest Android operating system out-of-the-box.
