It looks like the answer may be a tablet. Samsung just sent out invitations for its MWC press event complete with a shadowy image of what seems to be a new slate. The invite doesn’t give away any details, but a supposed Galaxy Tab S3 did pass through the FCC earlier today, and Korean outlet ET News claims the device will have a 9.6-inch 2048 x 1536 display, a Snapdragon 820 processor, and 4GB of RAM. The 2015 Galaxy Tab S2 was a solid tablet with an exceptionally slim design. It wasn’t particularly cutting-edge even upon release, though, so Samsung’s mainstream tablet line is due a refresh. The event is on February 26th at 1PM ET, and of course The Verge will be in Barcelona to bring you all the news.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:44:16.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
