Image: Julio Cortez/AP/REX/Shutterstock By Marissa Wenzke 2017-02-08 03:28:08 UTC \nSpotify has tapped an unexpected source to cue up a perfect playlist for your day: the weather report. \nPartnering with Accuweather, Spotify built Climatune , a website that generates playlists based on the weather in your location. The playlist-generator follows a yearlong research project that compared music streamed on Spotify to data compiled at 1,000 weather stations. Turns out, the weather seems to play a factor in the music you stream. SEE ALSO: A day in the life of a pianist \n“For almost all of the top cities around the world, sunny days translates to happier-sounding music,” Ian Anderson, a Spotify data researcher, said in a blog post by the streaming service. \nRainy days tend to call for slower-sounding acoustic music and snowy days tend to have you seeking instrumental songs. \nSome songs are more popular in certain cities, depending on the weather. For instance, sunny Denver sees a lot of plays of \"American Boy\" by Estelle and Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun.\" Rainy Los Angeles, meanwhile loves \"7 Years,\" by Lukas Graham and \"i hate u, i love you,\" by gnash. \nImage: spotify \nThe strength of the weather's impact varies a bit by location. \n“Sunny weather has a bigger impact in Europe,\" the blog states, although the Brits seem to have quite a different take on gloomy weather. \nFor one, Leeds plays happier music on cloudy days while Liverpool and Manchester both play more energetic music when it snows.
