As the Nation reported, Mnuchin eventually flipped OneWest to a financial holding company named the CIT Group for $3.4 billion in a widely protested merger.\nThe extent of Mnuchin's wealth also became an issue during the confirmation process when Senate Democrats accused him of failing to disclose hundreds of millions in assets.\n\"Mnuchin's failure to initially disclose his relationship with the funds, along with his minimizing the scope of foreign investment in them during the hearing, has Democrats questioning whether it was part of a deliberate effort to steer them away,\" CNN reported.\nJust one Democrat, former West Virginia governor and current Sen. Joe Manchin, voted to confirm Mnuchin, replicating his earlier lonesome support for Trump's U.S. attorney general, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions .", "external_links": ["http://fortune.com/2017/01/11/trump-cabinet-steven-mnuchin-net-worth/", "https://www.thenation.com/article/the-worst-of-wall-street-meet-donald-trumps-finance-chairman/", "https://twitter.com/markknoller/status/831300518609829888", "https://twitter.com/SenateMajLdr/status/806273397592326144", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/31/politics/steve-mnuchin-treasury-secretary-trump/index.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/steven-mnuchin-confirmed-treasury-secretary.html?_r=0", "https://theintercept.com/2017/01/03/treasury-nominee-steve-mnuchins-bank-accused-of-widespread-misconduct-in-leaked-memo/"], "published": "2017-02-14T09:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:46:48.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
