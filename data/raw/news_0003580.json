You're weak. And it was such a weak deal. So now he's going overboard with their star, Brady.\" \nHe added: \"The commissioner is a dope. He's a stupid guy.\" \nBy far the best deal Kraft ever made was hiring Belichick, Trump said. Who, by the way, is also \"a great, great friend\" of Trump's, even though everyone just assumes he's \"a really rough guy.\" Read or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/donald-trump-roger-goodell-dope-nfl-patriots-super-bowl-51-ray-rice-deflategate/ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:41:00.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
