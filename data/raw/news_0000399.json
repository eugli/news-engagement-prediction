Editor Advertisement \nToday at about 6.45pm, we encountered this inconsiderate big fxxked taxi driver who park his or her comfortdelgro taxi (SHA9303S) on the \"no parking lot\" today, blocking me and my wife and my young child's way. We have to walk one big round to reach our preferred route as my son is too young only 2 yrs old to walk our desired route home. \nThe illegally parked taxi has also blocked the pavement leading to the Handicapped lot as well, causing inconvenience to the less-fortunate, the elderly and also family with young child or with baby strollers. I think the undermentioned driver is indeed very selfish. This incident happened at block 445, Tampines st42 carpark area. \nJackie Chun \nA.S.S.
