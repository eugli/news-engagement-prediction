The Ambassador also alleged that Malaysia was 'colluding and playing into the gallery of external forces'.\" \nIn response the foreign affairs ministry \"emphasised that as the death occurred in Malaysian soil under mysterious circumstances, it is the responsibility of the Malaysian Government to conduct an investigation to identify the cause of death. \n\"This investigation has been conducted in the manner prescribed by Malaysian law.\" \nThe statement also added: \"The Embassy was informed that the death had been classified as sudden death and as such, a post-mortem would have to be carried out. The Embassy has also been informed that once the investigation are concluded, the body would be handed to the next of kin in accordance with existing Malaysian laws and procedures.\" \nThe ministry said that the Malaysian government has been transparent and that the North Korean embassy has been kept informed of developments as well as the processes involved under Malaysian law. \nOn Monday, Kang Chol met with Malaysia's Deputy Secretary General for Bilateral Affairs, Ambassador Raja Nushirwan Zainal Abidin, the ministry's statement said. \nThe Malaysian Ambassador in Pyongyang has also been recalled to Kuala Lumpur for consultations. - CNA ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T10:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:36:19.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
