Proceed at your own risk. Being the Bachelor is not for the faint of heart! \nNick Viall reportedly had a very difficult time deciding who he wants to spend the rest of his life with on The Bachelor finale — shocker! — and it basically caused a mental breakdown. \nFans of the hit ABC show have all witnessed the leading man or woman struggle with their final decision, but it may have been even harder for the four-time Bachelor Nation alum. \nIt got so bad, in fact, the 36-year-old was forced to create a “pros and cons list” just to decide between his final two women, Raven Gates and Vanessa Grimaldi , sources tell Life & Style. \nPros and cons, Nick? Was it not enough to trust your gut? \n“Nick told produc­ers he felt like he was in hell,” says the source. “He was having a complete breakdown and needed re­assurance on who he was picking.” \nAs expected, Nick turned to Chris Harrison for help during his dark moments. \nHe even reportedly had to stop filming three different times just to talk with our favorite TV dad host. \n“Nick was having mixed emotions,” the source continues. “He’s in love with both [women].” \nOh no! Is Nick going to pull a “Mesnick” at the After the Final Rose special? Or is he going to take a page out of Ben Higgins’s book and tell both women he loves them? \nWe’ll just have to watch and find out! \nThe Bachelor Season 21 airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint ’s coverage of The Bachelor below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:32:07.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
