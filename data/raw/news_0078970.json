Typically, a member wishing to filibuster will ask to speak and, in an attempt to stall legislation action, hold the chamber's attention for hours at a time. There are few rules that govern a filibuster because the Senate believes its members have the right to speak as long as they want on any issue. \nThe record for the longest filibuster is held by the late U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957 , according to U.S. Senate records. In the modern era, Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky staged a daylong filibuster in 2013 that captivated conservatives and libertarians as well as the national news media. \nCritics call the filibuster unconstitutional at worst and unfair at best. Others believe it to be a historical relic. Practitioners of the filibuster insist that it protects the rights of the minority against the tyranny of the majority. \nRelated Story: The 5 Longest Filibusters in History \nBy their nature, filibusters are meant to draw attention to a specific issues and have the potential to inspire compromise. According to the US Senate website , the word filibuster comes from a Dutch word meaning \"pirate\" and was first used more than 150 years ago to describe \"efforts to hold the Senate floor in order to prevent action on a bill.\" How Filibusters End \nFilibusters rules allow the delay tactic to go on for hours or even days. The only way to force the end of a filibuster is through parliamentary procedure known as c loture , or Rule 22. Once cloture is used, debate is limited to 30 additional hours of debate on the given topic. \nSixty members of the 100-member Senate must vote for cloture to stop a filibuster. At least 16 members of the Senate must sign a cloture motion or petition that states: \"We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to a close the debate upon (the matter in question).\" \nImportant Dates in the History of the Filibuster \nâ€‹Here's a look at some of the most important moments in the history of the filibuster and cloture. 1841 : Henry Clay threatened to change the Senate's filibuster rules to \"allow the majority to close debate\" when Democrats blocked a bank bill. 1872 : Vice President Schuyler Colfax ruled that \"under the practice of the Senate the presiding officer could not restrain a Senator in remarks which the Senator considers pertinent to the pending issue.\" 1919 : First use of Rule 22 when Senate invoked cloture to end debate against the Treaty of Versailles. 1935 : U.S. Sen.
