Advertisement \nThe comments - which breached rules about not discussing party matters in the media - came before a meeting of the NSW Liberal state council that was due to consider the issue, which has split the party along factional lines. \nMr Cameron is prominent among a group of right faction MPs, including former prime minister Tony Abbott, agitating for the introduction of plebiscites, while the left and centre-right factions argue that such a system would lead to branch stacking. \nMs Berejiklian is a leading member of the dominant left faction. \nOn Sunday morning Mr Cameron said the free speech issue is \"not about me.\" \n\"The question is about us, the Australian people, about whether the Australian constitution preserves the right to express freely a sincerely held, non violent political opinion or not,\" he said. \nMr Cameron said that \"those who seek to regulate opinion throughout history have sided with the vested interests.\" \n\"Robert Gordon Menzies, the founder of the Liberal Party, made some remarks on this subject when he said that the single greatest crime of fascism and of its twin brother national socialism was the suppression of free opinion,\" he said. \n\"We know what happened in 1945. I'm saying to you the greater crime of the Holocaust would not have taken place if national socialism had not first suppressed free opinion.\" \nLast month NSW Liberal Party president Kent Johns condemned Mr Cameron's comments at a Q Society fundraiser as \"highly offensive\" and accused him of becoming \"nothing more than a circus act\". \nDuring an address to a fundraiser held by the anti-Islam group Mr Cameron referred to the The Sydney Morning Herald as the \"Sydney Morning Homosexual\" and said the NSW Liberal Party was \"basically a gay club.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:16:42.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
