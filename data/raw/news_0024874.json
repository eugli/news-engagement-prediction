For starters, some of them think Nick was the hottest member of the Backstreet Boys. Even though it’s so clearly Kevin. \nBut that’s nothing compared to our political differences, which have come a major sore spot for all friendship groups in recent times - now that the world has changed so significantly. Brexit and Trump have challenged families, lovers and pals in the most intimate of ways. The perennial question: Kevin of Nick? Credit: EPA PHOTO AFPI/LUCY NICHOLSON /EPA PHOTO AFPI/LUCY NICHOLSON \nT here’s evidence that politics can even tear relationships apart. Don’t just take it from me; this week an American woman announced that she was divorcing her husband of 22 years, all because he fell for Trump! “It totally undid me”, she said. \nI expect she’s exactly the same sort of liberal who preaches unity over division, and “hope” over hate, yet happily bins her husband because he doesn’t hold her beliefs. The hypocrisy is astonishing, and doesn’t set a good precedent for how we should treat others with conflicting ideals. Watch | Married couple split due to differing views on Donald Trump 01:37 \nI say this mostly out of self-pity. No one in my circles shares my politics, which tend to be unfashionably right-leaning. If it wasn’t for my friends being so open-minded, I’d be Chazza No Mates - or have to live somewhere where they only talk about goats and apple picking. \nThough, I don’t think politics has to be a deal breaker in any relationship. Not least because the six members of my family share completely opposite views on everything. I was the only one, for instance, who voted Brexit, but they still gave me tea and hugs when I came home. Friction is positive. If you’re angry, you’re having to think. Debate expands the mind, and is the only way to shift politics \nW hat I’ve found is that it’s actually healthy to sit around the dinner table, wanting to punch each other. In general, people tend to avoid debating politics because of the friction it causes. But friction is positive. If you’re angry, you’re having to think. Debate expands the mind, and is the only way to shift politics. \nOne positive example of a family which has its disagreements is the Camerons. Twice, David Cameron’s mum has publicly contradicted his policies. Last year she opposed his spending cuts ; at an awards ceremony on Monday she mocked him, and praised Jeremy Corbyn instead . \nEveryone called this embarrassing, but David didn’t seem to care. “I’m incredibly proud of my mother”, he told the press. Could it be that, in the Cameron household, it’s not so bad to disagree over politics? Perhaps quarrels around the quinoa made the Houses of Parliament not quite as frightening. Most people - left and right - vote for the same reason: to make society better \nW hen people shun others because of their views, it’s as if they’re saying “politics define you”. But I’ve never thought this to be true. \nThe average person does not subscribe to political parties to be “bad”, as many liberals see Conservative types. Most people - left and right - vote for the same reason: to make society better. What they differ on is how this can be achieved.

She decided it was over with her husband after he told friends over lunch of his intentions to vote for Trump. Surely, if this was so terrible, she could have talked it over with him - instead of cutting all ties? She could have even swayed him over to the Democrats. I’ve pretended to like Blink 182 for love - a choice for the Democrats is nothing in comparison! \nSubscribing to a political system really isn’t so rigid as people think, like having brown hair or blue eyes or anything else that’s fixed. It can be molded and influenced. Just like I might be convinced that Nick Carter is the hottest member of the Backstreet Boys (but, let's be honest, Kevin has amazing eyebrows). \nStill, none of that will happened if we put up invisible division lines between those we disagree with. It achieves nothing, other than big surprises when it comes to voting time. \nWe need to be more bolshy; we need to be like David Cameron’s mum.
