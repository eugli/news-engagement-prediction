ID: 10436980 10. There was more confusion after Quebec police announced that only one of the men being detained was a suspect. Initial reports claimed Alexandre Bissonnette and Mohamed Belkhadir were both suspects. But police later released Belkhadir after determining he was a witness. View this image › Twitter/@CBCNews When the police said Bissonnette was the only shooter, most news media deleted their tweets and updated their reports. \nBissonnette and Belkhadir were first identified as suspects by TVA , based on anonymous police sources who spoke with the Quebec-based TV station. Other outlets followed. (Belkhadir’s name was given as Mohamed Khadir in initial reports.) ID: 10436501 ID: 10436507 12. But not all media treated the new information the same way. Fox News left an old tweet online that said the attacker “was of Moroccan origin.” They replied to it with new information and updated the associated article, but the tweet is still being cited. View this image › Twitter/@FoxNews Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s director of communications, Kate Purchase, later sent an official complaint to Fox News. \n“These tweets by Fox News dishonour the memory of the six victims and their families by spreading misinformation, playing identity politics, and perpetuating fear and division within our communities,” Purchase said. \nBecause police sources initially named Belkhadir as a suspect, many people pushed unfounded theories about a jihadi attack or, perhaps, internecine violence between Sunnis and Shiites . \nBut as subsequent reporting later made clear, Belkhadir was actually one of the heroes of the night who called 911 and tried to help the wounded even while the actual shooter was still on the loose. \n“I was trying to give first aid to my friend who was on the ground,” the 29-year-old university student told reporters after being released from jail. When he thought he saw someone with a gun, however, he fled. \n“I got scared. It was an image of a man who had a gun. I didn’t know it was a police officer. I thought it was a shooter who had come back.” ID: 10436528 13. But even though Belkhadir was cleared by police, some media outlets continued to cast suspicion on him. One of the Canadian media outlets still questioning Mohamed Belkhadir’s innocence is TheRebel.Media, which also bought the domain QuebecTerror.com shortly after the shooting. ID: 10437235 14. Rebel reporter Faith Goldy went to a vigil in Quebec City and asked people there whether they were “worried that there was another suspect” long after Belkhadir’s release. YouTube ID: 10436723 15. The Rebel further muddied the waters when it published a post and video about the supposed “bitter rivalry” between the affected mosque and another one nearby, even though this had nothing to do with the shooter.
