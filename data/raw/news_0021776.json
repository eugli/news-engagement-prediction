What would have happened if things had gone the other way? Then Britain becomes completely different, neighbours are spying on neighbours, there’s an Orwellian 1984 feeling.’ The action starts in November 1941. Southern England has been under Nazi control for a year. The Germans and Russians are about to celebrate what they call Friendship Week, where officers from both sides come to London for the removal of Karl Marx’s body from Highgate Cemetery so that he can be reburied in Communist Russia. SS-GB is an ambitious five-parter that, with its glamour, intrigue and complex characters, could be this year’s The Night Manager The series was filmed mainly in London, and the cast found it chilling when they went inside buildings and found them filled with swastikas and men in German uniforms. Sam says he was especially taken aback in scenes later on in the series when the Nazis’ racist laws start being enforced. ‘It’s one thing seeing German phone boxes in London and all these uniforms, but one scene that really sticks in my mind featured an extra with a Star of David pinned to his back. It was shocking seeing it. I spoke to the actor and he was Jewish, and it was really emotional for both of us, so frightening. And when you see it in the context of a British civilian it really makes you think about things.’ HITLER'S PLANS FOR BLACKPOOL Both Len Deighton’s book and the show draw on Nazi documents that detailed their plans for Britain after they’d invaded. One dossier showed the stately homes earmarked for Third Reich ministers to live in, and said that Eton was the school of choice for their children. Hitler particularly wanted Blenheim, where Churchill was born, and von Ribbentrop fancied St Michael’s Mount in Cornwall. While industrial sites in places such as Birmingham and Coventry were to be destroyed, Blackpool and Windsor Castle were to be saved. Blackpool was to be Hitler’s ‘personal playground’ and he hoped to see his troops marching down the Golden Mile, which is why it escaped the Blitz even though Wellington bombers were built there. The story is told entirely from the point of view of Archer. Sam, best known for his films Control – playing Joy Division singer Ian Curtis – and Maleficent with Angelina Jolie, dominates almost every scene. Although off-screen the Yorkshire-born actor is surprisingly awkward, on-screen he’s mesmerising. Ironically, Sam now lives in Berlin with his German actress wife Alexandra Maria Lara and their three-year-old son, and says he lobbied hard for the role when he heard it was being directed by acclaimed German director Philipp Kadelbach. Kate jokes they nicknamed the director ‘The Horny Hun’ because of the sex scenes. But Sam insists he refused to prepare for topless scenes. ‘My ambition was not to have a six-pack,’ he smiles. ‘Which I achieved. But I did get to wear a very nice suit and trilby.’ SS-GB will inevitably be compared to Amazon’s hit show The Man In The High Castle, which is set in a 1960s America that’s under joint German and Japanese occupation, but it’s grittier and closer to what could actually have happened. The recent popularity of dramas set during the war – ITV’s The Halcyon is another – comes at a time when fascism and racism are on the rise across Europe. ‘It’s very easy for those ideas to come around again,’ says Sam. ‘Once you start blaming a type of person for your problems, it can quickly slide into something very frightening.’ The fear of living in a fascist country – where one misplaced word or stupid action can result in instant death – is palpable from the start (Above: Sam Riley as detective Douglas Archer) The fear of living in a fascist country – where one misplaced word or stupid action can result in instant death – is palpable from the start. PANZER TANKS AT HIGHGATE CEMETARY The images of a bomb-damaged Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament draped in Nazi flags are computer-generated, but real London landmarks were used. The team spent three days filming at Highgate Cemetery for a scene showing the opening of Karl Marx’s grave. The Germanborn writer of The Communist Manifesto was buried there in 1883. ‘It felt amazing,’ says Sam Riley who plays Archer. ‘For the ceremony the swastika was mixed with the Soviet sickle on the flags. There were Nazi soldiers and Panzers nearby. You really do think about what might have been Part of that was achieved by using documentary-style hand-held cameras which make you feel like you’re part of the action. In one scene Archer’s secretary and lover Sylvia mucks about on a hotel balcony wrapped only in a Nazi flag after a night of passion. Then the phone in the hotel room goes and the terror of who it might be, what it might mean, crosses both their faces. The British Resistance are almost as terrifying as the Nazis. ‘Many of them are fundamentalists who’ll do anything to bring America into the war,’ says Sam. ‘It’s fascinating.’ He admits it made him wonder how brave he’d be if he’d been placed in that situation. ‘Archer speaks fluent German after studying it at Oxford, and the Germans use him as a totem. People are suspicious and even his own son asks if he’s working for the Gestapo. Meanwhile the Resistance are trying to threaten him into joining them. Archer’s a widower with a young son and as a parent you’re so much more vulnerable. That’s how it started in Germany; they terrified people. It was hard to stand up to them, especially if you have a lot to lose. I’d like to think I’d stand up to it, but who can say for sure?’ SS-GB will start on BBC1 later this month.
