The waiting time for hiring cab is also far away from the normal. \nCabs are available on Ola and Ubers apps throughout the day in the national capital since Saturday. Ola even started sending a notification to its customers on Saturday evening saying \"We are back in full strength\". Also Read: Court sides with Uber and Ola but cabs yet to return to Delhi roads \nSarvodaya Drivers Association of Delhi (SDAD), who claims to represent 1.5 lakh of drivers in Delhi-NCR, claimed although around 70 per cent of cabs plied in the morning, a major section of drivers in evening were off the capitals roads. \nSDAD vice-president Ravi Rathore, who is currently admitted at RML Hospital after his condition deteriorated as he was a hunger strike since Friday, said, \"We have so far not called off our strike. It will continue till our demands are met. Hundreds of drivers are still on dharna at Jantar Mantar in favour of their demands.\" \nRathore said that there was still no fresh communication from either Ola, Uber or the Delhi government. \nPinky Sharma, a resident of Gurugram, said that in morning, she was charged Rs 679 by an app-based cab aggregator for a ride to her office in New Delhi, but during normal days, the fare used to be around Rs 350. \nThousands of drivers are on strike since February 10 in Delhi-NCR demanding an increase in fares from the existing Rs 6 per km and also want the 25 per cent commission the app-based aggregators charge on every booking to be discontinued.
