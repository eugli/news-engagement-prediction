He pleaded guilty last week to three counts of damaging a door and floor over a six-month period from February to August last year. \nWhen police interviewed Camblin, he could offer no explanation other than to describe the act as “spontaneous”. Gives a whole new meaning to that phrase. Source: News Corp Australia \nInitially the man who owned the home sought £5,406 (AU$8762) in compensation, claiming he paid over £1000 (AU$1620) on a new front door. \nHe also cited the cost of the CCTV camera, services of a cleaning doctor, and his inability to rent the property out over the six-month period as further compensation claims. \nThe judge questioned this amount, and in the end ordered the offender to pay £500 (AU$810) in compensation. \nThe offender was suspended from work, and he later resigned. He is now being financially supported by his wife of 17 years. \nHe has been placed on 12 months’ probation and ordered to do 100 hours of community service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:01:05.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
