Following in the national-scale footsteps of Sharknado: The 4th Awakens , the latest installment will go international with its shark-storm carnage; if anyone wants to wager on whether a shark will end up knocking over the Leaning Tower of Pisa or impaling itself on the Eiffel Tower, we’ll be happy to take that bet. \nBut the most tragic thing about a fifth Sharknado movie—besides remembering a more innocent time, when the series’ winking stupidity was kind of refreshing , instead of deeply tiring in our cartilaginous bones—occurred behind the scenes. Rest assured, Anthony C. Ferrante is returning to direct his fifth Sharknado film. But for the first time ever, he won’t be joined by screenwriter Thunder Levin.
