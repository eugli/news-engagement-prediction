He’s just like me. \n“He’s going to come out and fight, it ain’t going to be a boring fight. He ain’t gonna hold me or nothing like that. He’s just going to come out swinging and banging like I always do.” \nThe possibility of a matchup between Lewis and Hunt probably has UFC matchmakers salivating at the chance of putting those two heavyweights into the Octagon together, but some business has to be handled first. \nHunt already has a fight scheduled for UFC 209 in less than two weeks when he faces Alistair Overeem in a featured bout on the main card for the pay-per-view. \nIf Hunt can get past Overeem, a showdown with Lewis could be the perfect fan-friendly matchup to put the winner one step closer towards title contention. \nAs for Lewis, he’s planning a vacation after keeping a very busy fight scheduled between 2016 and the start of 2017, so don’t expect him back in the Octagon until the summer. \nLewis told the FS1 post-fight show that he doesn’t want to get a call from the UFC for at least three months while he enjoys some rest and relaxation before climbing back into the cage for his next fight. \n“I’ve just been fighting every other month or every two months. I just want to clear my head a little bit,” Lewis said. “After my last fight, I wanted some time off but my coaches called me at a bad time when everybody was drunk and asked me if I wanted to fight Travis and I said yeah I’ll fight him. \n“This time right here I just want some time off, just relax my mind. Because I think by fighting constantly all the time and it’s just bringing problems at my house because I’m so serious with everyone.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T11:18:55.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
