Those 14 catches represent a new Super Bowl record, breaking a mark formerly held by Demaryius Thomas , via Pro-Football-Reference . Pro-Football-Reference \nWhite's 14-catch game made him one of 13 players with double-digit receptions in a Super Bowl, and the fourth member of the Patriots to join that club. Super Bowl XXXIX MVP Deion Branch tied the record with 11 catches back in 2005 and held it until Thomas had 13 in the Broncos ' loss to the Seahawks in 2014. Wes Welker also tied the record with 11 in 2008, while Shane Vereen had 11 in 2015. \nNow, White stands all alone at the top of the list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:49:45.720+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
