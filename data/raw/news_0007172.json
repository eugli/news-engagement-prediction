Article continues below \nThe dab is almost certainly - we hope - one of those strange trends in football that is forgotten about almost as quickly as it caught on. \nJudging by Pogba's Instagram, even the midfielder seems to have moved on. Whether that's a good thing or not, you be the judge. Article continues below Kevin Nolan signs himself for Notts County \nAs you'd expect, Lingard is in on the act too. \nHere, they are, summing up everything that is wrong with the state of modern football as we know it: \nIf you ever wonder what Premier League players get up to once the hard slog of training is over, this may be a rare insight. \nTo the younger generation of fans, this may not be a problem. However, it's not going down well with everyone: \nThen again, after Danny Welbeck's appalling 'Salt Bae' celebration at the weekend, it could always be worse. \nPogba, Lingard and co are now preparing for yet another fixture against 19th placed Hull City. \nJose Mourinho will be expecting a much better performance than when the two sides met in the EFL Cup last week, the Tigers running out 2-1 winners on the night - even if United still progressed to the final on aggregate. \nIt was Pogba who scored the Red Devils' goal in that game, but his celebrations were fairly muted - let's hope his new dance doesn't get an outing if he repeats those exploits on Wednesday night. \nWhat do you think of Pogba and Lingard's celebration?
