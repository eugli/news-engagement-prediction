As the Prime Minister said cyber threat is akin to bloodless war,\" Prasad said. Assembly Elections 2017: Will Modi magic work in UP, Uttarakhand, Goa, Punjab & Manipur? NEW DELHI: The IT Ministry today launched botnet cleaning and anti-malware analysis centre for Rs 90 crore to provide free anti-virus to computers and mobile phones for removing malicious softwares. \"I would like ISPs (Internet Service Provider) to encourage their consumers to come on board, there is a free service available. Come and use it in the event some malware has sneaked in to the system,\" IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said at the launch of Botnet Cleaning and Malware Analysis Centre. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (Cert-In) will collect data of infected systems and send it to ISPs and banks. These ISPs and banks will identify the user and provide them the link of the centre, launched in name of Cyber Swachhta Kendra. The user will be able to download anti-virus or anti-malware tools to disinfect their devices. \"The project has budget outlay of Rs 90 crore spread over period of 5 years,\" CertIn Director General Sanjay Bahl said. As of now 58 ISPs and 13 banks have come on board to use this system. The ministry also launched M-Kavach for security and anti-theft solution for mobile phones, USB Pratirodh to ensure only authorised person is able to access pen drive and AppSamvid for identifying genuine applications at the time of installations on computers. The minister directed Cert-In to also set up National Cyber Coordination Centre (NCCC) by June. The government has approved Rs 900 crore for NCCC which will monitor and handle cyber attacks on Indian internet space in real time. \"Safety and security is integral. As the Prime Minister said cyber threat is akin to bloodless war. I don't have slightest doubt cyber security is not only going to be big area of Digital Swachh Bharat but also going to be big area of digital growth, digital employment and digital commerce,\" Prasad said. To encourage startups in the field of cyber security, the minister announced that government has reduced testing fee for their product by half. At present Standardisation Testing and Quality Certification (STQC), a division under the Ministry of Electronics and IT, charges testing fee in the range of Rs 8-10 lakh per case but startups in the field of cyber security will need to pay only around 4-5 lakhs. To strengthen cyber security ecosystem in the country, Prasad said that CERTs will be set up at state level as well and 10 more STQC testing facilities will set up.
