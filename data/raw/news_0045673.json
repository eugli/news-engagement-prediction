Before tax earnings jumped to $604 million for the half year, as indicated by the company last month. \nThe result was helped by a big fall in asset write-downs, more cost cutting, as well as lower redundancy and restructuring costs. \nAlthough the higher Australian dollar, higher income tax and finance costs partly offset the good numbers. \nInvestors will get a higher interim dividend of 4 cents a share and the company has launched a share buyback plan worth up to $150 million. \nEarnings were boosted by BlueScope's outright purchase of US steelmaker North Star in late-2015. \nBlueScope chief executive Paul O'Malley said the company's restructure was reaping results with positive trading conditions across most of its businesses. \n\"We are now seeing the benefits of our strategic initiatives flowing through to the bottom line,\" he said. \n\"Our current focus is to further grow our business, particularly in Asia, which is seeing a rapid rise in the wealth of the middle class.\" \nHe said that demand for the company's premium steel products made in Australia continued to be strong. \nMr O'Malley said the Australian business had done an excellent job of boosting profitability after the 2015 decision to keep the Port Kembla steelworks, near Wollongong in New South Wales, operating. \nHowever, he said productivity improvements had to continue. \n\"We need to deliver returns necessary to support a decision in 10 to 15 years to reline the blast furnace (at Port Kembla),\" Mr O'Malley said. Chinese steel demand leads turnaround \nIt is a big turnaround for the steelmaker after years of painful restructuring and layoffs amid a glut of steel on global markets. \nBut a surge in Chinese demand since late 2016, because of policy changes in China and supply cuts, saw a big turnaround in both steel and iron ore prices. \nIron ore prices are currently trading at around $US90 a tonne, near a two-year high. \nChinese steel prices are at their highest level in four years. \nHowever, demand for steel in China softened for the fourth month in a row in February. \nThe Global Platts China Steel Sentiment Index fell by nearly 9 points from January to 25.21. \nA reading below 50 indicates contraction. \nSenior managing editor of steel and raw materials for S&P Global Platts, Paul Bartholomew, said the Chinese market was still finding its feet after the Chinese New Year holiday. \n\"Domestic demand for rebar will start to improve as the weather warms up and construction activity gathers pace,\" Mr Bartholomew said. \nBlueScope expects underlying earnings before tax for the second half of 2017 to be up to 50 per cent higher than the $340.4 million it made in the second half of 2016. \nEarnings before tax for 2017 are expected to come in around $1.1 billion. \nHigher cashflow saw net debt fall to $531.3 million in December 2016, down from $1.4 billion in December 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:38:14.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
