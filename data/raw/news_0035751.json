This Friday? HBO dropped the tech comedy’s first trailer for this new batch of episodes. \nRichard (Thomas Middleditch) has a big announcement that he needs to drop on the Pied Piper crew: He’s quitting. But he is taking the name Pied Piper — which we last saw being repositioned as a video chat company — and is going to try to build something else. Maybe a new internet? That sounds crazy. But maybe? Probably so crazy, it just might work. \nWatch Richard and Jared (Zach Woods) celebrate a new beginning in the trailer for season 4, which gets underway April 23. \nWant to revisit the big moments of the Silicon season 3 finale with T.J. Miller? Go here . \nHBO also released an image from the new season, which may have been taken before Richard’s announcement. But also? Maybe not.
