Former Razzie nominee Mel Gibson won the new Razzie Redeemer award, honoring \"a humbling transformation from crap-meister to creative genius, or at least the inkling of a solid attempt.\" Gibson was honored for directing the Oscar-nominated \" Hacksaw Ridge .\"\n\"From rant to rave, miracles do happen,\" Razzies video narrator Bill A.
