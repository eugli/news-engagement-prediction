He announced the winner as 'The King'. I found Elvis a surprising choice, but relaxed when Noel looked up to the heavens to clarify that he meant Bowie, who died rather more recently and therefore deserves all the awards he can get. Bowie was awarded two posthumous Brits: Best British Solo Male Artist and Best Album for Blackstar. We are always so much more comfortable telling people how fantastic they are after they have gone — it's a very British thing. Noel Gallagher gestures as presents the award for British Album of the Year to David Bowie's Blackstar at the Brit Awards at the O2 Arena in London Talking of uncomfortable, the heavily muted performance by Grime artist Skepta was difficult to watch for all the wrong reasons. He played in a complaint call from a viewer — a posh young lady who said she felt intimidated by his performance. (I currently have an OfCom complaint against me for using the word 'pussy' on the radio — I called the women's marches by their colloquial name, the pussy marches. I may play this into studio next week and simultaneously dance about in a hoodie making menacing gestures to highlight my grime / gangland credentials.) Fans were not happy — not happy because Skepta wasn't allowed to swear a lot, live on prime time TV. Fans were also not happy that Skepta didn't win. 'So … from no black UK artists nominated in 2016 to no black UK artists winning today? Is that what went down?' Which reflects the same kind of shock and awe felt amongst liberals that Clinton didn't win, even though she was a woman. As if having a vagina could trump Trump. If you are black, Mexican, Spanish speaking, from a minority group, LGBT or Muslim, liberals believe you should get a free pass to the final. And preferably win. I believe their confusion stems from the thoroughly modern belief that an award show needs to not be too white. And to be a successful award show, black people also need to win. Regardless of the competition. The Oscars have paved the way for this kind of thinking and I think you will agree it represents real progress for liberal types: don't win in spite of your colour, win because of it. A colour quota, if you will. A female film critic was torn apart earlier this week for daring to criticize the movie Moonlight as not being 'necessary', 'important' or 'urgent, demonstrating precisely what happens if you fail to follow the approved script on this. Simon Cowell failed to follow the autocue, and was plunged into darkness as he gushed with fatherly pride over Liam Payne from One Direction. Perhaps the lighting guy had had enough of him — hadn't we all? Robbie Williams performs on stage at The Brit Awards 2017 at The O2 Arena on February 22 Even 'Brit Icon' Robbie Williams failed to impress — and we were counting on him to relieve the boredom. He was about as iconic as meatballs. The most exciting moment of Robbie's set was when one of his backing dancers' nipples broke free, hoping it could entertain us instead. And this is just the start of it; award season is looming large. Beyond the Oscars there's still the Golden Globes, the Critics' Choice Awards, the Hollywood Film Awards… The list goes on. Endless opportunities for those with no mandate to lecture us as if they do, for desperate attempts not to be #ohsowhite, and for an endless parade of over-indulged egomaniacs to display their bleeding-heart credentials. If only entertainment could be as entertaining as politics. These days, it simply cannot compete.
