NRA cheers nomination of Neil Gorsuch, seen as gun rights defender Read more \nThe nominee requires 60 votes in the Senate, meaning that at least eight Democrats must offer support to avoid a filibuster, unless Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell changes Senate rules to lower the threshold to 50 votes – a scenario known as the “nuclear option”. \nOn Wednesday, Trump gave his approval to this manoeuvre. “Yes, if we end up with the same gridlock we’ve had in Washington for longer than eight years, in all fairness to President Obama, a lot longer than eight years,” he said in the White House, “if we end up with that gridlock, I would say, ‘If you can, Mitch, go nuclear.’ Because that would would be an absolute shame if a man of this quality was put up to that neglect. I would say it’s up to Mitch, but I would say, ‘Go for it.” \nTrump was meeting with “Scotus [supreme court] groups” in the Roosevelt Room and expressed hopes that Democrats would find his nominee acceptable. “We want to watch him go through an elegant process as opposed to a demeaning process,” he said of Gorsuch. “They’re very demeaning on the other side. They want to make him look as bad as possible. Of course, the media can very demeaning, as well. \n“I really think he’s a very dignified man, and I would like to see him go through a dignified process. I think he deserves that. And hopefully it will go quickly. And we will see what happens.” \nTrump noted that Democrats had previously supported the Denver-based Gorsuch, currently on the 10th circuit court of appeals. “I think there’s a certain dishonesty if they go against their vote from not very long ago. He did get a unanimous endorsement … You can’t do it better, from an educational ... from any standpoint. A great judge, he’ll be a great justice. I feel it’s very dishonest if they go back.” \nThe nomination of Gorsuch, 49, looks set to trigger a bitter political battle as Democrats look for ways to resist the Trump White House. \nSome have already announced their opposition. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said on Wednesday: “I plan to stand up for individuals over corporations and oppose his nomination, and I will insist that his nomination meet a traditional 60-vote threshold.” \nJeff Merkley of Oregon said: “This is a stolen seat being filled by an illegitimate and extreme nominee, and I will do everything in my power to stand up against this assault on the court.” \nBut others are reserving judgment. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Senate judiciary committee member, said: “I think that he is owed what Judge Garland never got, which is a full hearing, a chance for the American people over several days to better understand his views on the constitution and a wide range of the rights that are central to our republic.” Gorsuch expected to follow Scalia's lead in opposing abortion on supreme court Read more \nDemocrats will also face pressure to resist from liberal groups and non-government organisations. Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said: “After unnecessarily holding open a vacancy on the supreme court for nearly a year under President Obama, any effort now by Senate Republicans to rush this process should be resisted.” \nGorsuch was welcomed by Senate Republicans to Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Accompanied by the vice-president, Mike Pence, he met first with McConnell, who called him an “outstanding appointment” and declared: “We’re all thrilled and looking forward to getting the confirmation process started.” \nGorsuch’s conservative legal philosophy is seen as similar to that of Scalia. Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T22:18:00.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
