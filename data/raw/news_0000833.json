Fiscal 2016 was a long year for Apple. But they did not just get it over with - they ended it with a lot of bangs. Amid a year of historic results misses, questions on resilience and controversial releases, the technology giant once again flaunted it's never-bet-against-us mantra as it produced record-shattering results during its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2016, with iPhone sales and revenue leading the way. \"We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way,\" CEO Tim Cook said in a Press release along with the earnings call that began at 1:30 am Dubai Time. \"We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-times revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch.\" Cupertino, California-headquartered Apple posted new all-time high quarterly revenue of $78.35 billion, handily pipping the $75.9 billion posted in the year-ago period; the figure was up 67 per cent and three per cent over the previous and year-ago quarter, respectively. Profit was at $17.89 billion, while per-share profit was at $3.36. iPhone sales - propped by the latest 7 and 7 Plus models - were at 78.3 million, beating FactSet's average analyst view of 77.42 million, up 72 per cent from the previous quarter and easily topping the previous record of 74.8 million also set a year ago. Revenue was at $54.38 billion, besting last year's $51.64 billion and almost double that of the previous quarter at 93 per cent higher. iPad sales were at 13.1 million, up 41 per cent from the third quarter but down 19 per cent from last year, posting a $5.53 billion revenue, up 30 per cent but down 22 per cent, respectively. Mac sales were at 5.37 million, 10 per cent better from the previous quarter and almost flat compared to last year. Revenue for the segment was at $7.24 billion, 26 per cent and seven per cent better, respectively. Services raked in $7.17 billion, up 13 per cent from the third quarter and 18 per cent higher from last year. Revenue from other products - which includes the Apple Watch - pitched in $4.02 billion, ballooning 70 per cent from the previous three-month period but eight per cent lower than last year. Again, no specifics were given for the wearable device. The Rest of Asia-Pacific region had the biggest leap in regional revenue, rocketing 119 per cent to $5.86 billion from the previous quarter's $2.67 billion. The Americas ($31.97 billion, 58 per cent), Europe ($18.52 billion, 71 per cent) and Japan ($5.77 billion, 33 per cent) also posted positive results quarter-over-quarter. And while Greater China - identified as a key market for Apple - was up 85 per cent at $16.23 billion sequentially, it was down 12 per cent year-over-year. App Store purchases churned in $3 billion in December alone, the best for a single month. Revenue from Apple Music and Apple Pay also increased, with the latter, according to the company, witnessing a more-than-500 per cent rise in transaction volume. Apple has forecast, for the fiscal second quarter, revenue between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion. 'iPhone 8' hints? \"Outstanding results,\" Cook said at the beginning of the conference call with analysts immediately after the release of the results. The CEO also reiterated Apple's goal of transforming its Services unit into the size of a Fortune 100 firm, and that it would double it in the next four years. Chief financial officer Luca Maestri also took a jab at Apple's main rival: App Store revenue was more than double that of Google Play last year. Customers and revenue at Apple Stores worldwide, meanwhile, also posted double-digit growth. Apple now has $246.1 billion of cash at its disposal. \"We returned nearly $15 billion to investors through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter, bringing cumulative payments through our capital return programme to over $200 billion,\" Maestri said. And answering a question about the next iPhone - \"iPhone 8\", as it has been tagged so far - Cook said it was still \"early\". He did, however, talk about software improvements such as those for home, car, and health, but gave no clue on hardware upgrades. Apple's board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of the company's common stock. The dividend is payable on February 16, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 13, 2017. The company's shares were up 2.8 per cent after an extended trade. - alvin@khaleejtimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T07:32:38.582+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
