It is the first time that anyone other than Kinney's X-23 had been mentioned for Logan, but it throws some interesting theories out there. In the comic books there have been allusions to an X-24, although there is no official #comicbook character out there under the moniker of X-24. The Weapon X program clearly didn't stop with Kinney, while the Innocence Lost comic saw Dr. Rice reveal incubation pods for #24â€“#50. We already know that Richard E. Grant's Rice is behind the creation of X-23, so is there someone else on his side as well? Who, or even what, X-24 will be remains to be seen, but with Boyd Holbrook's Donald Pierce being queued up as the film's Big Bad, could Mangold move away from Pierce's comic book storyline and have him weaponized by Rice? Sorry to bring it up, but we saw a similar thing happen in X-Men Origins: Wolverine when Ryan Reynolds's (first) Deadpool was turned into Weapon XI. Either that, or we could see an army of Kinney clones taking on X-23 and Logan, which to be honest, sounds a bit too Resident Evil for my liking.

As for the spoilers, the tracklist probably gives away more than it is supposed to, and we know that Holbrook has promised that there will be some \"surprises\" on the way. Weapon X-24 going up against Wolverine and Kinney would be one hell of a way to bow out of the franchise. Only time will tell, but with all the hype around Logan , and some calling it one of the greatest #superhero films of all time, we know we're in for a treat. While the album is expected to go live alongside the film's theatrical release, the physical album will probably be around toward the end of March, but is available for pre-order on Amazon. \nCheck out our video for the Logan Easter Eggs, and don't forget our poll below! \nWant more Movie Pilot video?
