The legends and the myths.\" \nBut he's not like the other guys who did stuff! He is no Achilles, he's just a sensitive dude advertising his willingness to settle. And then the beat drops. \nThe song is from The Chainsmokers' forthcoming debut album, Memories...Do Not Open , which Martin is very much looking forward to. excited for @thechainsmokers ' album; I've heard some songs and I love them. cm \nâ€” Coldplay (@coldplay) January 22, 2017 \nBasically, it's just a pretty forgettable pop song with EDM flourishes that pitches dullness as a virtue and complacency as romance. There aren't even any of the Chainsmokers' hyper-specific and weirdly compelling details about pool parties soundtracked by pop punk and yes, alcohol. It's almost commendable how meta the song gets, \"How much are you willing to risk?\" Apparently, the answer is nothing. \nIt will, however, help a lot of teens convince their parents to let them go see those nice boys who write songs with Chris Martin so a cursory Google search doesn't ruin everything. \nThe video will probably involve a bunch of rainbow smoke and lights to jazz things up a bit.

Is there a greater pain than watching a bromance go down in flames?
