He was booked in a sleeper class (S-2) compartment of the train like an ordinary prisoner. \nRajendra Nagar Terminal station was turned into a virtual fortress by the police administration as a large number of supporters of the former MP jostled to get a glimpse of the gangster-turned-politician. \nThe former MP from Siwan was moved out of the Beur jail at around 4 pm in a prisoners' van, which was followed by more than 10 police vehicles. \nAccording to sources, over 20 policemen from Siwan were also booked with him on the train. \nOn Saturday, Shahabuddin was brought to Patna amidst tight security with a team of special task force (STF) along with top district administration officials accompanying him. \nAccording to a police officer here, Shahabuddin was kept in Beur jail under tight security. \nShahabuddin is a criminal turned politician and locally known as 'Bahubali'. He faces 35 criminal cases including murder, extortion, kidnapping and has been convicted in seven. He is also suspected to be the mastermind behind the sensational murder of journalist Rajdeo Ranjan last year. \nRajdeo Ranjan was the Siwan Bureau Chief of Hindi newspaper Hindustan, which is part of the Hindustan Times Media company.
