He hopes to publish his book and teach kids about dwarfism by putting it in schools. \n“Younger kids might not know about uncommon things like dwarfism, putting this in the school systems will be a teaching lesson,” says Windeler. “Even though these people have differences, there’s something to learn off them.” \nWindeler says his condition never stopped him from being a normal kid and participating in all the things his friends could.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:32:26.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
