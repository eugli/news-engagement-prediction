Yahoo7 Be - Yahoo7 \nFirst it was Amber Sherlock and Julie Snook's fiery clash over a white shirt, and now Christie Hayes and Sarah Cumming have had their own wardrobe malfunction! VIDEO Christie Hayes mocks Jacketgate. Source: Channel Seven Christie Hayes mocks Jacketgate \nAppearing on The Daily Edition , Christie joined the panel to talk about her new role on Wollongong’s i98FM breakfast show wearing an off-the-shoulder pink dress, while co-host Sarah was also sporting a dress in the same shade! Christie wore pink on The Daily Edition. Source: Channel 7 But so did host Sarah Cummings! Awkward! Source: Channel 7 \n\"Sorry about the colour. I should have gotten a blazer,\" Christie said, referring to the moment Channel Nine's Amber insisted Julie put on a jacket when she turned up also wearing white for a live TV segment. \nThe 30-year-old former Home and Away star then jokingly called out to producers: \"Can I get a blazer please? We're both wearing pink.\" \nOf course, it's hard to forget Julie and Amber's catfight that went viral last month after the outburst, which took place just before they went to air, was caught on camera and leaked by an unknown source. \n\"I need Julie to put a jacket on, because we're all in white,\" Amber says at the start of the footage, which shows the two women in different studios. Fellow commentator psychologist Sandy Rae laughs, presumably thinking Amber must be joking. Three women in white in the viral video.

I'm a big believer that the universe doesn't give you what you can't handle so when this came up I thought there was no way I could say no.\" Christie and husband Daniel on their special day last year.
