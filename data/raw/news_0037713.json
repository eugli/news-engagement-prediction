Footballs (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 1:22 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 1:22 a.m. ET \nThe Salt Lake City Screaming Eagles were playing the first game in franchise history and their fans got a little too excited following a touchdown. \nThe Screaming Eagles played host to the Nebraska Danger at Salt Lake City's Maverik Center, but were trailing 14-0 in the first quarter. \nMORE: Super Bowl commercials really aren't that great \nWith just under 5 minutes remaining in the first quarter, receiver Derwyn Lauderdale caught a short touchdown pass from quarterback Verlon Reed. Each of the Screaming Eagles offensive plays were called by fans through the team's app. \nFans were so proud of themselves for choosing a scoring play, they decided to storm the field, with 4:47 remaining in the first quarter. The first quarter. It cannot be stated enough that this occurred in the first quarter and the extra point was delayed for several minutes. The team's sideline reporter used the opportunity to do an on-field interview with Lauderdale, who said he was proud to be part of history after scoring the team's first-ever touchdown. \nOnce fans were finally cleared off the field, the snap for the extra point was bounced back to Lauderdale, who was the holder. There was a penalty called against Nebraska, so the Eagles got another opportunity for the kick, which was then missed. \nBy the way, those fans who were so excited at the beginning of the game were long gone by the time the Danger completed a 78-47 victory. \nThe entire game was live-streamed on Sports Illustrated and included commentary from comedian Norm Macdonald. The ridiculous fan storming occurred about an hour into the broadcast. If you go to the 3:30 mark, a camera spanning the remaining fans spends about 20 seconds on a young boy with his finger up his nose. \nIt's classy stuff, folks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T13:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:25:04.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
