The character’s Japanese roots in the sci-fi source material sparked claims of whitewashing around the movie adaptation. \nFurther enflaming the backlash was a report claiming the producers ran tests that were later scrapped to make the actors appear Asian; the studio stated Johansson wasn’t involved in those tests. \nProducer Steven Paul later defended casting Johansson in an interview with BuzzFeed . “I don’t think it was just a Japanese story,” he said. “ Ghost in the Shell was a very international story, and it wasn’t just focused on Japanese; it was supposed to be an entire world. That’s why I say the international approach is, I think, the right approach to it.” \nIn a behind-the-scenes featurette released for the film, Mamoru Oshii, who directed the original Ghost in the Shell anime movies, gave his blessing to the new adaptation. \n“Scarlett Johansson, playing Motoko from beginning to end, has gone above and beyond my expectations for the role,” he said. “I’m sure this will be the most gorgeous film in the series so far.” Oshii further asserted Ghost in the Shell remains “very true to the anime.” \nDirected by Rupert Sanders, Ghost in the Shell also features Michael Pitt, Rila Fukushima, Juliette Binoche, Pilou Asbæk, Ran Wei, and Chin Han. The film opens in theaters March 31. Show Full Article ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T20:28:19.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
