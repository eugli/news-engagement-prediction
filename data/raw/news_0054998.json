Who will he face? Who should he face? Right now, Conor McGregor and Michael Bisping are GSP's two preferred choices, it appears, with Bisping being the frontrunner. Do these fights make sense? Are they the right calls? We'll examine the possibilities and weigh them to see which works best for all parties involved as well as the sport. \nWe'll also recap the two events from over the weekend, UFC Halifax and Bellator 172 . We'll discuss what's next for winners like Derrick Lewis , Johny Hendricks , Paul Felder and Sara McMann . We'll also examine what might be next for those who came up on the losing side of the equation, e.g. Josh Koscheck , Travis Browne and Josh Thomson . \nAs usual, we'll also dig into other forms of news and notes you may have.
