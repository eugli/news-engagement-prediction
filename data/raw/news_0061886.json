By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 25, 2017 1:05 PM PM’s visit is a part of campaigning for the two-phased Assembly polls in the state. (PTI) \nAddressing a campaign rally in Manipur’s Imphal, Prime Minister Naredndra Modi on Saturday said that country’s development is incomplete without Nort East’s development. Taking a dig at Congress , the PM said that Grand Old Party ‘ignored’ region for the past 15 years. “In 2014 when I was PM candidate,there was a rally at same place, but even half the ground was not occupied. Today its packed with crowd,” PM Narendra Modi said in Imphal. “No work done in 15 years, Congress ignored North East,” he added. “Until North-East does not progress, the country’s progress will never be complete,” PM Modi said. PM’s visit is a part of campaigning for the two-phased Assembly polls in the state. The venue of the rally was shifted from Kangla Fort to Langjing Achouba after Irom Sharmila’s People Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA) raised objections. Voting will be held on 4th and 8th of next month. 266 candidates including ten women are in the fray. Congress and BJP are the two main players in the election fight.

Among the regional parties, Naga People’s Front has fielded 16 candidates and People’s Democratic Alliance (PDA) one. Twenty three Independents are also in the fray. \nThis is a developing story.
