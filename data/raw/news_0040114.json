Kyrus Branch admits he’s a little nervous to dust off his dancing shoes. \n“I am absolutely nervous. I cannot dance,” said Sgt. Branch. “One of the prerequisites is that we have to dance with the kids. I’m looking forward to it.” \nSgt. Branch’s partner, 11-year-old Lamya Bolden, said her father doesn’t live in the area and couldn’t attend the dance. \nLamya exclaimed “of course!” when Sgt. Branch asked her if he could take her to the dance. \nSgt. Branch’s fellow officers found out about the dance and signed up. He said the dance is personal to him. \n“I grew up in a single-parent household as well. So it’s two-fold,” said Sgt. Branch. “It’ll leave a positive impact on me… a lot of officers are so delighted to be doing this.” \nWith the school’s cafeteria turning into a dance floor, the officers hope to make a night to remember for the girls. \n“It just shows that fathers care,” said Sgt. Branch. “Hopefully it’ll leave a positive impact for a lifetime.” \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.   rewritten, or redistributed.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:04:24.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
