Young, Ivanka Trump's senior director of marketing told Refinery29. \"We believe that the strength of a brand is measured not only by the profits it generates, but the integrity it maintains.\"\nOf course, Young's statement could just be alternative facts.\nGet non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed.
