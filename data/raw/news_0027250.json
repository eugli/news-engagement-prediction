It depends with the level of indulgence. As a juvenile, I used it. I was also in India where the plant is legalized but it is vital if people are disciplined. You can choose not to use it,\" said Okong’o. \nHe stressed, \"As a House, we can come up with regulations that encourage deterrence. The government can allow it but have regulations that restrict use.\" \nIn particular, the senators shifted focus and pinned down Okong’o on whether his candidature was as a result of the state of mind he finds himself in, after consuming the drug. \nALSO READ: Kalonzo: I am best Opposition's flag-bearer in August elections \nSenator Haji also pleaded with his colleagues not to disallow the petition, arguing that even Senator Okongo used the plant but still managed to become a legislator. \n\"The gentleman's petition should be allowed and he should appear before the committee to explain himself. Senator Okong’o used it but it didn't prevent him from being a legislator,\" said Haji. \nOkong’o defended his decision to run for the presidency, saying he was a former consumer of bhang and it didn't have any negative effect on him. \n\"I used to use it sometime ago. It didn't inform my decision to contest for presidency. If the senators want to know about the plant, the House should organise for a retreat to discuss the same,\" said the besieged senator.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T18:19:03.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
