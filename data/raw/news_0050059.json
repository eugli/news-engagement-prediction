These people are traumatised and they need urgent basic amenities as they return home. Rehabilitation has to do with their survival as human beings first,” Zoro added. \nMembers said several provisions appeared questionable. \nZoro noted, “Maybe, you must first give us the mandate of the PCNI. You have N184m for screening programme for humanitarian activities. \nWhat does that mean? \n“There is N150m on advocacy and early warning system and N165m for conflict management. \n“You are going to deliver security equipment for N200m. What type of security equipment? Then another N2.5bn for security outfits. \n“Are you telling us that part of your role is to fund the operations of the military in the North-East? The military have their own budget already. \n“Why are you not talking about food, shelter, medical care and schools for these IDPs?
