It incorporates an uptempo, high energy style. Hyphy is also characterized by witty lyrics and rugged beats.

You'll know a trap track by its beat--stuttering kick drums, hi-hats, 808s, and oodles of synthesizers. \nKey Artists : Future, Gucci Mane, Young Thug More »", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:08:48.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
