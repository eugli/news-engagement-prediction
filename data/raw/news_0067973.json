With the specialty nature of the Brazilian, it should be treated with extra care. Prep: Find someone crafty . All Estheticians and most Cosmetologists (depending on your state) are licensed to perform waxing. You don't want someone who simply offers the service just because they can. Rather you should choose a tech that has much experience, is skilled, and would consider bikini waxing their specialty. It's even more important when removing hair on the genitals. Seek out referrals from friends, family or reputable review sites. Waxing Salons are another great place to start, as this is their specialty.

Your skin is often more sensitive the time near your period, and waxing can be more painful than normal. Make appointments at least a few days before or after your period. Most places will not perform, or prefer not to peform this service while you're on your period. Cleanliness. Shower and lightly exfoliate your entire bikini area right before your appointment using warm, not hot water. Make sure you're extra clean and have gotten all the nooks and crannies. Skip this step. Don't use any lotions or oils in the bikini area . These moisturizers can interfere with the wax process by not allowing the wax to adhere well to the hair. Hair for now. You need some hair growth for the wax to hold onto, but not too much length which can make the waxing hurt more than it needs to or cause breakage and missed hair. Let the technician trim hair down to just the right length at your appointment, or follow the salon's instructions for trimming. Pain preventers. Take a pain killer, like Tylenol, 30- 45 minutes before your appointment if you're worried about discomfort. (Aspirin and Ibuprofen may not be the best choices as they both are known to thin blood.) Numbing creams are another option to make skin less sensitive during the process. During: Know exactly what you want. This service often removes hair from the behind and between your legs. Sometimes a strip of hair or triangle is left in the front. Don't be afraid to communicate to your tech exactly how much hair you want to keep and be removed. Remember, you can always create your own. Check out the styles for women and styles for men . Be prepared. If you've never had this service, you may not know that you might be asked to help to hold skin and move around so the tech can get to every last hair. Learn about the different techniques used. A little hurt. Everyone is different in their tolerance and perception to pain, but some discomfort is generally expected. See tips for reducing pain . Watch your fashion choices. Don't wear tight pants or panties for the next few days. Hands off. Keep hands away from touching freshly waxed skin, as this can encourage irritation or small pimples (see more: prevent side effects of waxing ). Opt for a shower. Don't take a hot bath for the rest of the day as soaking in water could cause unnecessary irritation or pimples. Too hot. No tanning beds, saunas or steam rooms for the next two days. Short-term abstinence. Sexual activity should be avoided for at least 24 - 48 hours. Exfoliate. Two full days later, if there isn't any redness use a mild exfoliator. This helps prevent ingrown hair . My pick is an Ayate washcloth. I love that it gently exfoliates skin alone wet but also can be lathered up with body wash and is more mold-resistant than loofahs.
