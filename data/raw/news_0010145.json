ADVERTISEMENT \nFor Lea, this two-night musical affair—happening at the Philippine International Convention Center’s Plenary Hall on Feb. 17 and 18—is a venue for experimentation and for highlighting fantastic songs that the audience do not hear often (call 891-9999). \n“I’d like to take this opportunity to test new pieces, songs people do not expect me to do,” she said at a recent press conference. “We are avoiding a lot of those tried-and-tested songs—para naman hindi ’yun na lang ng ’yun. That way, I get challenged; it makes me excited and nervous all at once. And that is a good thing!” \nThe Tony- and Olivier-winning artist is slated to bring to the fore lesser-known compositions by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Claude-Michel Schönberg and Stephen Sondheim. \n“We have a lot of the older stuff, but we will put a spin on them. By using new arrangements, we hope that the songs evoke something different, or convey another story that has nothing to do with the musical they came from,” related Lea, who is collaborating with director Bobby Garcia, musical director Gerard Salonga and the ABS-CBN Philharmonic Orchestra for the gig. \nBecause it has been about 15 years since Lea has done a major concert with such a concept, she made it a point to include songs from musicals that have come out since, such as “Waitress,” whose music is written by Sara Bareilles and, of course, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “Hamilton.” \nWhile she did not go into the specifics of her intended set list, she did reveal that she was going to sing the torch song, “Burn,” from the hip-hop-infused Broadway hit, “Hamilton,” which is touted by not a few critics and theater fans as the most important production in recent times. \n“Burn” is a heart-wrenching ballad performed by the character Eliza Hamilton, upon learning about the infidelity of her husband, the American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton. “If you’re craving for “hugot,” then look no further, Lea quipped. \nIt is a song that the singer readily connected with. Sitting in front of a trash can, burning letters and photos while the smoke wafted—she had been there before, she related. But even though “Burn” can be emotionally agonizing to sing, it is also a cathartic experience. \nWhen asked if she would still slip in a few songs from “Les Misérables” or “Miss Saigon” here and there, Lea said “yes,” but most likely not the staples. \n“[But] when I sing something that I have been singing for years, I make sure that my storytelling is clear—and that helps keep it fresh,” Lea said. \n“There would be instances—in rehearsals, especially—when you would inadvertently do something you didn’t know could be done. And when that small tweak works, you breathe new life into the song,” Lea said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:32:52.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
