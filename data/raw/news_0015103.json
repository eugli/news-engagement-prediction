These are brave courageous stories but most are from a long time ago. \nI think people would like to believe that was then and this is now and surely things have changed, surely our kids will be safe but this is misguided and simply isn’t true. \nMy question is: for the poor child in the “Evil 8” case, in a society where we are supposed to be so aware of the scourge of sexual abuse, could we have stopped this sooner? \nWere there signs of the abuse? If so, where were her teachers who have mandatory reporting responsibilities? Where were the rest of the family? Her friends? Doctors? The rest of us? \nMy intention is not to lay blame on others after the fact because we know that child sexual abusers are cunning, their methods of control are powerful and their threats are targeted and heinous. Ryan Trevor Clegg, 42, jailed last week as one of the Evil 8.

We must work hard to make the reporting processes easier and we must empower all in the community with the knowledge they will be listened to. \nWe also need to fix the laws in relation to punishment of convicted paedophiles. \nToo often we hear of punishments that are too lenient when the survivor of the abuse gets a life sentence. \nWe need courageous law makers and judges, police and prosecutors to do all they can to protect our kids. Dawid Volmer: the former pastor was jailed after admitting he stupefied the blindfolded girl with an inhalant and raped her in front of her father.

How did this happen? \nWe need tighter bail and parole conditions so that convicted child rapists don’t get easy access to other kids in circumstances where they are not rehabilitated, and we need our governments to do more to rehabilitate offenders so that when they are released, the don’t go back to their previous behaviour. \nWe need to keep the current Royal Commission spotlight on institutional responses but we also need to broaden our lens. \nAbuse in institutions is only a part of the problem, it is now happening more often within the home and family. \nPerhaps we need to look again at the education campaign for our kids about what they can do if this is happening to them. Maybe we all need a reminder on how to respond if we suspect that this is happening. \nAnd if it does happen we need to wrap all of our arms around the victim of the abuse. \nWe need to ensure support, counselling, treatment, love and care are all easily available. We need to give them a voice again. \nAs all the media focuses on the monsters in the Evil 8, my thoughts are with the victim — who I hope with all my heart is a survivor. \nLisa Flynn is an abuse law expert with Shine Lawyers “We need courageous law makers and judges, police and prosecutors to do all they can to protect our kid”.
