Sponsored 13 realities of going wedding dress shopping \nThe proud papa posted a snap of Emily feeding their son Theodore James with the caption: ‘I walked in and saw this. Just perfect #hungrylad.’ \nAnd while, on the most part, the image garnered the reaction of ‘stunning’ and ‘lovely’, it also received furious backlash for his ‘overshare’. A photo posted by Peter Andre (@peterandre) on Feb 9, 2017 at 1:57pm PST \nMany followers were not impressed that the 43-year-old had given such an intimate insight into his family wrote. \nOne commenter wrote: ‘Do we really need to share this moment with them? I don’t think we do, we don’t want to share their sex life, arguing, going for a s***, popping a spot etc.’ \nAnother added: ‘It is beautiful, but private between a family, not on Instagram. Sorry Pete, disappointed.’ \nThe image was also blasted for not ‘giving an accurate portrayal of breastfeeding’. \nOne user wrote: ‘This is a beautiful pic and I am so happy Emily is willing to have her pic BF’ing put out there but in my view this isn’t a natural pic of breastfeeding, breastfeeding is amazing and wonderful, but it hurts your back, neck, boobs etc etc. \n‘There is no way Emily would be sitting in that position on that chair just bf’ing. Make it more natural next time to truly make your point !’ Peter received backlash for his Instagram snap (Picture: Instagram/Peter Andre) \nThankfully, the response wasn’t entirely negative, with one fan telling the dad of four: ‘Promoting breastfeeding is what this country needs. Re educate and lead by example. Beautiful pic X’ \nOne joker added: ‘Bless her my oldest cat used 2 suckle on me when he was a little kitten bless Xx.’ \nAt least we hope that’s a joke. Peter recently welcomed his second child with wife, Emily MacDonagh (Picture: Instagram) \nThe 27-year-old gave birth to the little lad back in November, which proved to be a pretty traumatic experience.
