They are like any other business person,\" said Hwang of the roughly 250-strong group.\nBut they would think twice before sharing news of the assassination with friends or family when they go home.\nEach North Korean family living abroad reports to the local embassy every month for a debrief and when they return, they undergo \"re-education\" before being allowed to return to the general population, he said.   \nOn Saturday, around 40 North Koreans made their way to the embassy in Kuala Lumpur, South Korea's Chosun TV reported as its journalists quizzed the group over the killing which Seoul's spy chief said was carried out by agents from the North.\nAnalysts believe Jong-nam may have been seen as a rival to his younger sibling, in a dynastic regime that has never loosened its grip on power in three generations.\nWhen asked whether Pyongyang could have been responsible, one North Korean said, \"This is dog talk (nonsense)\" before walking away and telling the reporter to leave him alone.\nNorth Korea's ambassador has spoken of \"hostile forces\" acting in the investigation into the killing, and accused Seoul of defaming Pyongyang in a bid to distract from a corruption scandal at home.\nThe incident has rapidly cooled relations between North Korea and Malaysia, which had been unusually warm, with a reciprocal visa-free travel deal for visitors.\nUp to 100,000 North Koreans are believed to be working abroad and their remittances are a valuable source of foreign currency for the isolated regime.\nNorth Korea commentator Park Sokeel said it was likely the Pyongyang Koryo waitresses had no idea about the killing, as workers living outside the closed state are kept on a tight rein with their access to media limited to approved material.\n\"They are very likely to be tightly controlled by a North Korean company where they interact only with each other and will not be allowed to leave the premises,\" he said.\nAnd even if workers did catch a glimpse of the international press they would find it difficult to understand the news, as most would not know their leader had an elder half-brother.\n\"It's not even a question of whether people know that he died because people didn't even know that he was born,\" he said. - AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T08:32:56.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
