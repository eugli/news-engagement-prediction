He also said the UK would do its best to avoid a “cliff-edge” effect.\n“A never-ending transitional status is emphatically what not we need, not what we seek,” he said. “But a phased process of implementation of new arrangements - whether immigration controls, customs systems, the way we operate and cooperate on criminal and civil justice matters, on future regulatory and legal frameworks of business will be necessary for both sides.”\n\nBut there was no development on the future legal status of EU nationals living in the UK or British expats abroad, after the white paper said it had “not proven possible” to reach agreement on future rights with the European Union. \nBehind the scenes, a number of senior Tories, from both the leave and remain camps, are pressing No 10 to unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU citizens to remain in the UK but the government has not yet relented given the lack of an EU-wide deal. \nBrexit white paper: key points explained | Jon Henley Read more \nIn the House of Commons, Theresa Villiers, the former cabinet minister and Brexit campaigner, was one of those who asked for greater certainty, highlighting the case of a constituent, an EU national who has cancer.\n\nVilliers said she was “very anxious to be able to give her certainty as soon as possible that she will continue to have access to the NHS”.\nNigel Evans, a Tory MP and leave supporter, said it was a “form of mental torture and trauma” for EU leaders not to agree to a deal securing the regarding the rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU.\n\n“Will he redouble his efforts to get this deal done as quickly as possible and make the announcement as quickly as possible?” Evans asked.\n\nOn the question of guaranteeing EU citizens’ rights, Davis said there was “no question that this is not going to happen”, arguing it was simply a matter of the timing of a joint announcement by all EU member states. He said it was clear that nobody would be “throwing people out of Britain” as a result of the Brexit deal.\nThe document says that providing certainty to EU nationals already in the UK is an early priority but that securing access to healthcare for UK nationals in EU countries is also a key priority.\n\nIt added: “We recognise the priority placed on easy access to healthcare by UK nationals living in the EU .... The government would have liked to resolve this issue ahead of the formal negotiations. And although many EU member states favour such an agreement, this has not proven possible. The UK remains ready to give people the certainty they want and reach a reciprocal deal with our European partners at the earliest opportunity. It is the right and fair thing to do.”\nThe paper, entitled The United Kingdom’s Exit From And New Partnership With The European Union, was published a day after MPs voted overwhelmingly to permit May to press ahead with starting withdrawal negotiations.\nIt contained a number of new policy suggestions including potential dispute resolution mechanisms for a trade deal with the EU, which could see a new arbitration system set up.\nIn an introduction to the report, May said the UK does “not approach these negotiations expecting failure, but anticipating success”.\nKeir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, criticised the government for publishing the white paper only after MPs had voted in favour of Brexit and revealing little new in the document.\n“Flicking through the white paper I see ... all that’s said about the final vote is that the final deal that is agreed will be put to a vote in both houses of parliament. \n\n“We have amendments down next week seeking a meaningful vote – a vote in this house before a vote is taken in the European parliament,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T16:37:42.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
