The teams end the first quarter tied at 0-0, with sacks and punts being the main theme so far. The Falcons won the opening coin toss and deferred, giving the Patriots the ball to start the game. It was an uneventful three-and-out, with Falcons linebacker Deion Jones stuffing LeGarretter Blount on third and 1, forcing a punt. Atlanta’s first drive got off to a roaring start with Devonta Freeman ripping off a 37-yard run to midfield. However, the drive stalled from that point and Matt Ryan ate a sack on third down, setting up the Falcons’ first punt. Tom Brady got the Patriots near midfield with strikes to Danny Amendola and Chris Hogan that got chunk yards. But the Falcons’ defense stiffened up once again, and Courtney Upshaw dropped Brady for a 9-yard loss, taking the Pats out of field goal range. James White couldn’t haul in a deep pass and Brady got sacked again on third down, ending the possession without any points. On the Falcons’ next drive, they used Freeman and Tevin Coleman to get some yards on the ground, but another Ryan sack led to yet another punt. The quarter ended with New England sitting at its own 40-yard line.
