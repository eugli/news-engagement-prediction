It’s one way for the city to compete with suburbs that are increasingly attracting large companies with wide open spaces for new offices. \nThe city created a tax increment district and has a development agreement with Beck Ventures, which owns the biggest piece of Valley View, to start tearing down the mall by April 22. There are two other main owners, and one of them has started demolishing the former Macy’s. \nShot June 13, 1970 - aerial photo of Sears store which opened first before the rest of Valley View Center opened in 1973.

Tom Dillard / staff photographer Sears \nSears is the only department store still open at Valley View. \nSeritage Growth Partners owns the Sears store and 22.5 acres. It’s the prime northwest corner of Preston Road and LBJ Freeway that fans out from the mall and includes parking, its auto center and the Jared jewelry store. \nSeritage is a big holder of mall real estate but doesn’t have a huge track record yet. The publicly-traded real estate investment trust was formed in July 2015 from 235 properties and more than 30 joint-venture interests from Sears. Seritage leased back almost all the properties to Sears including Valley View. \nThe Valley View Sears store has consolidated into a portion of one level. Seritage has a right to recapture all of the space from Sears to lease it to another tenant or for redevelopment purposes but hasn’t exercised that right yet.

(Rose Baca/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer \nSeritage declined to say what it plans to do with the Valley View property. In general, Seritage has told investors that its plan is to repurpose significant components of its portfolio from Sears stores into “first class, mixed-use and retail projects.” \n“From what I understand, Seritage doesn’t want to cancel the Sears lease until it has a new tenant,” said Scott Beck of Dallas-based Beck Ventures, which purchased the common areas of the mall in 2012 and has since made seven more purchases. Beck owns the largest piece of the mall property. \nKDC specializes in corporate headquarters. It’s building Toyota’s more than 2 million-square-foot North American headquarters and other office buildings in Plano’s Legacy West. That project will be finished this year. KDC also led the development of State Farm’s new CityLine campus which was completed last year. \nKDC declined to comment on the prospects for the Sears which opened in 1965 and predates the mall which was built in 1973. \nAMC Theater is the other big tenant still operating and likely will be open through the end of this year, Beck said. AMC does a pretty good business, he said, with lower prices on premium movies including $4 matinees. Customers will still be able to access the theater’s 16 screens while other areas are demolished, he said. Rebuilding Valley View Center is really about rebuilding Dallas Macy’s \nMacy’s is the first part of the mall to start coming down. It closed in early 2008 and was followed out of the mall by Dillard’s later that year. J.C. Penney closed in 2013. \nWhile the Macy’s work has started, but is going to take a couple months before the building is demolished, said Karen Owen, chief financial officer of EF Properties. In addition to asbestos remediation, which is a slow process, the company is trying to salvage valuable materials such as escalators before the whole building comes down, she said.

Beck also owns outlying buildings facing Alpha Road that include Chuck E. Cheese and the Sportsplex. \"We control all the access points,\" Beck said. \nWhile the initial pieces are coming together for demolishing Valley View, the redevelopment is expected to take 10 to 20 years to complete. \n\"We see this as a critical area,\" for future growth of Dallas, Beck said. Proposed new streets and development of a larger region called the Midtown District that includes Valley View Center on the east side and Galleria Dallas on the west. Valley View Center, built in 1973, will be scraped. Beck Ventures Beck referred to the time it’s taken for Uptown neighborhoods to develop into what they are today. \nHe predicts the broader region that they are branding Midtown District. will have as big of an impact on Dallas as Uptown. It includes Valley View north of LBJ and bordered by the Dallas North Tollway and Preston Road, extending north of Alpha Road. \nThese local developers are counting on Preston and LBJ becoming the close-in option to outlying suburbs for companies looking for new office locations in North Texas. \nA Dallas address is still highly sought after, and many companies based in the suburbs tell the outside world they’re based in, ahem, Dallas. \n“This is a large area in a great position to be very successful,” said Hammond Perot, assistant director of the city’s Office of Economic Development. “We’re looking for the highest and best use and a response to people looking at the suburbs.” \n“The mall has been underperforming for a long time and the property is underutilized,” Perot said. “We’re looking for a sustainable neighborhood.” \nIt’s just going to take a while. \nTwitter: @MariaHalkias", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:13:22.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
