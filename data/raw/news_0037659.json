Donald Trump's controversial pick for the job is the only cabinet member to be receiving such protection. A spokesperson told Politico that the Marshals Service 'is not aware of providing a protective detail for the U.S. Secretary of Education in the past' and that the move was authorized by the Attorney General. Previous education secretaries have had a security unit coordinated by the Education Department and it is not clear whether there is coordination between the two bodies for Devos.

DeVos, whose nomination only cleared the Senate after Vice President Mike Pence broke a tie following a contentious process, was greeted by parents, retired teachers, and a small band of aggressive protesters as she visited a middle school in southwest Washington. She ultimately made it inside, but not before having to retreat to her government SUV while getting shouted at by protesters who stood just a few feet away from her.
