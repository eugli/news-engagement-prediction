Denver linebacker Miller was next at 17 in balloting announced Saturday night. Khalil Mack (Photo Credit: Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images) \nMack was, by far, the standout player on a Raiders defense that ranked only 26th overall. He had 11 sacks, took part in 73 tackles, forced five fumbles and recovered three, and even had an interception for a touchdown. He’s the second Oakland defender to win the award; cornerback Lester Hayes got it in 1980. \nMiller also had a big year with 13½ sacks, 78 tackles and three forced fumbles for the fourth-rated Broncos. \n– By BARRY WILNER, AP Sports Writer \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
