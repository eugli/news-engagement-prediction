Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party is keen to make a comeback in the state. \nHome minister Rajnath Singh, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and seen as a potential chief ministerial candidate, has been crisscrossing the state for several weeks now. \nHe had a busy Wednesday as he visited Tarabganj, Sahajnava, Ghanghata, Isouli and Sultanpur among other places. He, too, has been camping in Lucknow. \nSmall industries minister Kalraj Mishra, a prominent Brahmin face from Uttar Pradesh, was busy campaigning in Jalalpur, Kapilvastu and Mahadeva. \nWhile only a few senior ministers campaigned in Goa, Uttarakhand and Punjab, which voted earlier this month, UP is a different ball game.

It even shifted its polls cell, operated by mid-rung leaders, from Delhi to the state capital Lucknow. \n“Only one senior person has stayed back in Delhi. Everyone else is in Lucknow,” a source in the party said. \nFor the BJP, the outcome in UP will decide the direction its government will take at the Centre. A win in the bellwether state will embolden it to go ahead with economic reforms. \nThe party wants to put the bruising defeat in Bihar behind it and as Rajnath Singh told HT “UP will compensate for the loss in Bihar”. \nIt will also help improve the ruling coalition’s tally in the Rajya Sabha, where it is in minority, and put it in a more comfortable position ahead of the presidential poll in July. \nPoll duties, however, are not at the cost of the government work. On Wednesday, all ministers were in the Capital for a cabinet meeting. \nThe party will be missing the services of external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, a good orator and a crowd-puller, who is recuperating from a surgery. Otherwise, all senior ministers are taking turns to the campaign roster. \n“The maximum campaign duty naturally has been given to people who belong to the state,” a source said. \nThe outcome of the push will be known on March 11 when results of all the five state polls, including Uttar Pradesh, will be declared. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:27:42.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
