Alexander Acosta to serve as U.S. secretary of labor, an administration official said on Thursday, one day after Trump's original choice withdrew.\nTrump is scheduled to announce his pick on Thursday at a 12:30 p.m. ET news conference.\nAcosta is dean of the Florida International University College of Law in Miami and is Trump’s first Hispanic nominee.\nBefore returning to the private sector, Acosta had a decades-long public service career, serving in three presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed positions.\nHe was appointed to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) by former Republican President George W. Bush, who also appointed him to be assistant attorney general in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.\nHe was then appointed to be U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where he went after high-profile defendants such as Jack Abramoff and UBS, resulting in the Swiss bank paying more than $750 million in fines for a tax-avoidance scheme.\nThough Acosta signed hundreds of opinions at the NLRB, some of which are sure to draw scrutiny from progressives, those familiar with his work described a careful, cautious public servant whose career trajectory suggested he may someday vie for a federal judgeship.\nHaving gone through multiple vettings by the U.S. Senate, it is also unlikely that there are surprises in his background that could derail a second Labor Department nomination.\nTrump's first labor secretary pick, Andrew Puzder, the chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc, removed his name from consideration on Wednesday amid concerns he could not garner enough Senate votes to be confirmed.\n(Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T20:04:32.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
