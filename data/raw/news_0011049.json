Surrounded by caped dancers, she segued into a theatrical take on “Born This Way,” complete with a crotch grab straight from Michael Jackson’s own 1993 halftime show.\nLady Gaga performs during the halftime show of the NFL Super Bowl 51 football game between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons Sunday, Feb. 5, 2017, in Houston. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings)\nAs thrilling as her army of dancers was, perhaps she should’ve stayed on her high-flying wires a little longer, as her halftime’s show’s risky stunts — and hair-raising surprises — ended as soon as she unhooked from her harness.\nRunning quickly through her repertoire of hits, Gaga teased a potential Beyonce cameo on “Telephone” (who never came out) before emerging in a spiked golden jacket with a keytar for “Just Dance,” the lyrics projected in lights held by fans on the field. The orbs quickly changed to warm candlelights, as she sat at a piano and declared,”We’re here to make you feel good,” before a stirring take on “A Million Reasons” that lingered just a little too long.\nGaga’s “Mad Max”-channeling performance continued with the night’s best, and last, performance. Backed by a stage full of dancers in dystopian white getups, Gaga quick-changed into a high-waisted crystal underwear and a bondage-inspired crop top for “Bad Romance,” flames erupting behind her.\nLady Gaga performs during the halftime show of the NFL Super Bowl 51 football game between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons Sunday, Feb. 5, 2017, in Houston.

Show over.\nAfter last year’s politically charged statement from Beyonce during her cameo in Coldplay’s halftime show, and Gaga’s history of supporting Democratic causes, many predicted that predicted that Gaga would unleash a Trump statement, a political protest that never arrived during her set Sunday.\nLady Gaga performs during the Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl 51 Halftime Show at NRG Stadium on February 5, 2017 in Houston, Texas. (Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)\nAt her pre-Super Bowl press conference Thursday, she suggested that her performance wouldn’t be free of politics. “The only statements I’ll be making during the halftime show are the ones that I’ve been consistently making throughout my career. I believe in a passion for inclusion, the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country, one of love and compassion and kindness,” she said .\nMaeve McDermott, USA TODAY\n Super Bowl halftime show lady gaga", "external_links": ["https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/633950566_66862251.jpg", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/633950566_66862251.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=676", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66862205.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682?w=1024", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66862261.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682?w=450", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/deborah-cox-in-the-bodyguard-0044r-photo-by-joan-marcus.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66862261.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2017/02/02/complete-guide-lady-gaga-super-bowl-halftime-show/97358396/", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66862205.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/633950566_66862251.jpg?w=454&h=300", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/screen-shot-2017-02-05-at-8-18-41-pm-e1486348022196.png?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66862261.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682?w=1024", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66862205.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682?w=450", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66862261.jpg?w=150&h=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/633950566_66862251.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=676?w=454", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66862205.jpg?w=150&h=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/ad.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/633950566_66862251.jpg?w=150&h=99", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66862205.jpg?w=450&h=300", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66862261.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/633950566_66862251.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=676?w=1024", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66862205.jpg", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66862205.jpg?w=768&h=512", "http://wp.me/p7fJAs-21CO", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66862261.jpg?w=768&h=512", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66862261.jpg?w=450&h=300", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/633950566_66862251.jpg?w=768&h=507"], "published": "2017-02-06T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T09:22:14.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
