I thought I would become a popular actor like him. An actor can become a star, but to retain that position like Shah Rukh Khan, Salman (Khan) or Aamir (Khan) for 25 years is difficult.” \nAsked about the challenges she had to face in the industry, she said: “Those depend on your journey. Those who come without any reference are tagged as an outsider... like me. The most challenging part for them is to make an identity in the crowd. However, the positive side is that the industry always recognises good work.” \nShe cited the example of actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui, saying how he once played a character who was beaten up by Sanjay Dutt in Munna Bhai MBBS and has now become one of most acclaimed actors in the industry. \n“One needs to be stubborn when you have to face the world. Though our elders think that being stubborn isn’t a good quality, but it is important when you go out,” added the 28-year-old Nil Battey Sannata actress.
