Who is this man seen walking away from where bodies of two girls were found? \nRodriguez had told police that he and his girlfriend had ‘rough sex’ and then had fallen asleep but officers later found photos on his phone of her lying on the mattress surrounded by blood. \nMs Rodriguez, who was also a student at New Mexico State University, was found in an apartment at midday the following day. \nA preliminary autopsy determined she bled to death from severe internal injuries that apparently took place during sex, the El Paso Times reported. Fierro was jailed at 384th District Court (Picture: Google Maps) \nDuring a bond hearing in 2015, the defendants lawyer Thomas D. Carter IV explained the pair were ‘in love’ but had engaged in consensual but rough sex. \nBut prosecutors told the court that many of Fierro’s ex-girlfriends had told investigators that he had a tendency for using objects during sex. \nFierro, who also worked as a personal trainer while studying at the University of Texas, had charges of aggravated assault with a weapon dismissed.
