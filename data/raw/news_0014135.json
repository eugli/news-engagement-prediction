When Titan FC MMA fighter Andrew Whitney allowed his frustrations to boil over after a defeat last Friday, however, the consequences were much more serious than he intended. \nWhitney, nicknamed 'The Beast', had been on a four fight win streak before he encountered Farkhad Sharipov at Titan Fight Championship 42 last week. \n'The Beast' would go onto lose the bout 49-46, 48-47, 48-47 and upon hearing the announcement of the result, lashed out, completely unaware that an unsuspecting ring girl was stood behind him, catching the full force of Whitney's fist in her face. \nWhitney did go to catch the girl immediately after realising what had happened, and fortunately, according to Titan FC CEO Jeff Aronson, who spoke to Daily Mail Australia about the incident, she was more surprised than injured by the punch. \"Our ring card girl was attended to by the ringside doctor and officials. She indicated she was fine and was more surprised by the punch than injured. \"Titan FC is broadcast around the world and we expect our athletes to conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times. \"We have spoken with Andrew Whitney and his management and are taking appropriate actions to make sure this unforeseen incident is not repeated.\" \nWhitney has yet to comment on the incident. \nIt's a good job it wasn't someone in a similar stature to Kimbo Slice, Brock Lesnar or Stipe Miocic or else it could have been a lot worse!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:29:50.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
