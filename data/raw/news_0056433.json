(Angela Rowlings/AP)  27 PM \nAaron Hernandez might want to hang up the prison phone moving forward. \nMassachusetts prosecutors filed court documents Wednesday that include phone transcripts of Hernandez speaking with former University of Florida teammate Mike Pouncey about what the Commonwealth contends may help convict Hernandez in his upcoming double homicide trial. \nJury selection is ongoing for the trial that is scheduled to open on March 1, but the court documents highlight conversations between Hernandez, who has previously been convicted for the murder of Odin Lloyd, and Pouncey, also an NFL player. \nProsecutors pointed to one phone call on April 3, 2015 and stated that Hernandez felt he was being \"tried\" or tested by clubgoers in Boston. \nAlexander Bradley, a former Hernandez associate who was with Hernandez the night of the alleged murders, is expected to testify that Hernandez felt disrespected by Safiro Furtado and Daniel de Aubreu in a night club before Hernandez allegedly shot and killed them. Mike Pouncey (Wilfredo Lee/AP) \nA second phone call with Pouncey took place on April 28, 2015 and involved discussion of a tattoo that Hernandez wanted. The court papers quote Hernandez: \n\"During this call, [Hernandez] stated words to the effect of, 'I’m going to get another tattoo that looks like a stop sign that will say, ‘Beware, no hesitation.’ [Hernandez] said, 'You feel me? Like try me and there’s no hesitation.'\" \nHernandez is accused of killing de Abreu and Furtado as retaliation for someone bumping into him and spilling a drink in a Boston club. \nPouncey has been one of the few teammates to publicly support Hernandez since he first became a suspect in the Lloyd killing.
