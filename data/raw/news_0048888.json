(Photo: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd) Share Get daily   \nA charity fundraiser and event organiser died in his sleep from a deadly cocktail of cocaine and ecstasy after a Christmas jumper party. \nDarren Batey, 32, had mixed the drugs with alcohol during a party to celebrate \"tacky Christmas jumpers\". \nBut it is feared he may have succumbed to their powerful effects during the night he spent with Paul Sutemire at his flat in Hulme . \nHe was found dead in bed by his flatmate on December 21 last year, 24 hours after Mr Sutemire was seen leaving the apartment carrying his shoes in his hands. \nMr Sutemire, 33, was quizzed by police but was cleared of any wrongdoing after tests on Mr Batey’s body showed there were no signs of violence. \nThe dead man – whose friends included Coronation Street actor Antony Cotton – had worked for the Albert Kennedy Trust, which cares for young people in the LGBT community and had helped raise £100,000 for charities including Macmillan Cancer Support. Darren Batey was a popular charity fundraiser.

It was his annual tacky Christmas jumper party and if you didn’t go, it wasn’t even worth talking to him. \n“I did not see Darren take any other drugs before we left the house but whilst we were in the pub he went off to purchase more cocaine. At around 4am we all went home at about the same time.” \nMr Apsley-Thompson's husband James said: “I saw Darren taking drugs and had seen this previously so it wasn’t a surprise. But something about his appearance made me question if he had taken anything else. \n“His hair looked out of place when it had been previously styled and he was making erratic actions with his hands. He seemed a lot more animated.” Darren Batey 'was a huge character and very outgoing' (Photo: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd) \nMr Sutemire told the hearing: “I had met Darren previously at a party – probably about a couple of months before that night. On the 19 December I wasn’t at Darren’s party but I had been out myself. I was my work’s Christmas party. \n“I went home around 1am which isn’t far from Darren’s house. I carried on drinking with my flat mate and his friend. Darren and I were chatting on the dating app Grindr and we decided to meet up and I got a taxi to his. I can’t remember whose idea it was to meet up. \n“I had also taken cocaine. I think I got to Darren’s at around 6am. I don’t remember anything after getting to his flat, I don’t even remember if we had sex.” Read More Pensioner dies after being hit by lorry in Cheetham Hill \nMr Sutemire said: “The only thing I remember is going to the bathroom at some point to be sick. I remember seeing Adam the next morning. \n“I went to go and charge my phone and then I fell asleep on the couch. I woke up and that is when I left. I didn’t see Darren before I left. I didn’t go back to Darren’s bedroom after 9am and when I left the room he was asleep. To my understanding he was alive and asleep and did not complain of feeling unwell.” \nHe added: “I didn’t have any of his friends on Facebook so I didn’t feel it was appropriate to speak to any of them about it when I found out. I didn’t find out about Darren’s death till a couple of weeks later. It didn’t even occur to me that it happened after the night that we spent together. \n“The police came to me for questioning but I never volunteered any information. Looking back now I should have done.” Darren Batey raised thousands of pounds for charity. \nMr Batey was found lying face down on his bed in the foetal position. Tests showed he had died from drug toxicity with traces of MDMA, cocaine and methadone in his system and he was also the equivalent of twice the legal limit for driving. \nDet Insp Anthony Lee of Greater Manchester Police said: “We couldn’t speak to the last person who had seen Darren alive. We wanted to investigate further as Adam had claimed that he had heard the couple having sex. \n“Mr Sutemire actually left the property at 12.21 hours and was wearing jogging bottoms and grey hoodie. He was carrying his shoes in his hands.” Read More Storm Doris to hit Greater Manchester with winds of up to 80mph \nRecording a narrative conclusion of drugs related death, Senior Coroner Nigel Meadows said: “There were no signs of any kind of assault or natural explanation for his death. Darren was an adult and if he wished to take drugs and alcohol that was up to him but sometimes that can have very adverse effects. Nobody really knows what the effect of taking these kinds of drugs are as they are not medicinal. \n“Mr Sutemire’s statement is very vague about that night but there is nothing to suggest that even if they did have sex it was not consensual. We do not know when Darren died, only when he was found. It could have been a few hours before he was found or it could have been the night before. \n“I will just say that anyone who takes drugs and alcohol are are risking death.” \nFollowing Mr Batey’s death, Mr Cotton, who plays Sean Tulley in Coronation Street, tweeted his condolences, along with Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North in London, who knew Mr Batey through the National Union of Students.
