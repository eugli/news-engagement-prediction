'I couldn't believe my luck. But then he pulled it back and lit it and said 'I'll give you some change, I've changed it into fire.' He added: 'It was absolutely disgusting. It was horrible. Just plain nasty. I suppose it's better than getting punched and kicked or even spat on because that has happened before.'

Not only removed from the University, but be made to work voluntarily for 200 hours in a homeless shelter.' 'Horrible young man,' another wrote.
