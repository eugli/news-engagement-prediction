There’s a lot more downforce, a lot faster through the corners, everything you know of, and that means more load on the driver, which, it’s quite a considerable amount more than before, which is a good challenge. \n“We’ve not done any work to get the balance perfect, today is really just about ticking off all the list, all the check points with the car, and then getting mileage for reliability. And I think in the days to come we’ll start to improve the car.” \nMeanwhile, Hamilton had mixed feelings about the new cars in general: “I think the cars look fantastic. The wider wheels, the wider body, the wider chassis, I think it does look fantastic – and hopefully it’s great for the fans. I was driving behind a couple of cars, it’s harder to follow, it’s going to be harder to overtake, tires don’t degrade. So yeah, it’s going to be very interesting.” 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:09:00.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
