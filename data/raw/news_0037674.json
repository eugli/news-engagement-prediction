(Submitted By Jennifer Power Scott)\n\"I think people need to watch out for them,\" Buchanan said.\nJennifer Power Scott, who first saw the birds on Thursday, agreed.\n\"I saw one guy backing out while the ducks were very close to the rear end of his car,\" Power Scott said.\nSomeone also, clearly, thought they looked hungry. On Friday morning, the ducks were walking around quacking — accompanied by a few of the usual mall seagulls — as they munched on a pile of birdseed.\n\"I think they wait around for the feeding,\" Buchanan said.\nDucks are fine Longtime birder Jim Wilson, thinks  the weather — as well as the availability of tasty birdseed — is why the ducks have left their usual habitat in Marsh Creek.\n\"We've had a tremendous amount of snow, and pretty cold weather, so some of that open water might have become more restricted and maybe frozen over,\" Wilson said.  \n\"As they push snow into the marsh, that may have also displaced the birds.\"\nUp to 100 ducks have been spotted near the edge of the parking lot since Monday's blizzard, and birder Jim Wilson said the weather is likely partly to blame. (Submitted by Jennifer Power Scott)\nBut he said there's little reason to be worried.\n\"Mallards are very hardy and adaptable,\" he said. \"They can certainly handle the cold. If they needed to migrate in order to eat, they probably would have already done so.\"\n\nIf people feed them, he recommends sunflower seeds, cracked corn, or other grains.\nBut \"if food becomes available, one duck might come, and then others will soon gather,\" he said.\nThe bottom line is that the mall mallards will move out when they're good and ready.\n\"These birds are very mobile,\" Wilson said. \"If they were hard done by, if they didn't have enough food or open water, they could easily fly elsewhere.\n\"So their life isn't threatened or anything like that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:10:52.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
