So much of what passes for contemporary conservatism is wedded to a kind of radicalism—fantasies of global hegemony, the hubristic notion of America as a universal nation for all the world’s peoples, a hyperglobal economy.\" The American Conservative offers a refreshing change from the usual ranting that has come to characterize so much of today's political discourse.

In the area of foreign policy, our editorial point of view is based on avoiding foreign entanglements and going to war only when necessary to defend our country and citizens.\" Put simply, The New American offers excellent content for those looking for a decidedly paleoconservative perspective.
