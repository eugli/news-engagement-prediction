THE SUN After meeting at a taxi rank, Ammelia and Lewis Bloor ended up in bed together THE SUN Ammelia had no idea he had a girlfriend until her friend Googled him \nShe claims he showed an interest in her straight away – and was begging to “snog” her. \nHours later the stunning recruitment agent and Lewis were kissing passionately beneath the covers of a Central London hotel – watched on by her gobsmacked pal who captured the encounter on her phone. \nIn the video – obtained exclusively by The Sun online – Lewis can be seen running his hands over Ammelia’s body as she straddles him. \nMarnie posted a cryptic tweet reading: “Don’t make eternal life long promises with a deceiver They wont change.And u always end up getting your ♥️broken.” \nMeanwhile Lewis posted: “Good things come to an …” \nIt is not clear if Marnie dumped Lewis after finding out about his antics last Wednesday night. THE SUN 12 She claims he showed an interest in her straight away – and was begging to “snog” her \nAmmelia told The Sun online: “My friend spotted him as we were queueing up for a ride back to our hotel after the gig. \n“We asked what he was doing and he said his mates had gone back to Essex without him. \n“As a joke I asked if he wanted to come in to Central London with us and he jumped in the back. THE SUN 12 Lewis in the back of a taxi – where he apparently pleaded with the driver to let him have a cigarette \n“As soon as we got in to the car he started telling me he wanted to kiss me – I thought it was really funny as I didn’t fancy him in the slightest. \n“He was so drunk, and kept asking the driver if he could smoke in the car. \n“That was a no, but the driver did pull over so he could buy some more booze, he picked up a bottle of vodka and a bottle of Red Bull. THE SUN 12 The reality star asked the driver to stop so that he could buy more alcohol \n“There was loads of traffic and we were playing drinking games in the back – he was begging me to spit neat vodka in to his mouth.” \nBack at the girls’ hotel near London Bridge, Lewis accompanied them to their room so they could continue drinking. \nAmmelia, a recruitment agent from Bristol, claims the fitness app boss continued to show he was interested in her, touching her and telling her “I wanna snog you.” Marnie Simpson and Lewis Bloor are a favourite with fans who saw them fall in love on CBB last summer \nShe added: “He was really pervy from the start. \n“We just went back to the hotel room to chill out – we aren’t from London so didn’t really have any idea about where to go after hours. \n“We continued to drink loads, Lewis was really drunk and chatting about random stuff.” \nBut it wasn’t until after he went to the bathroom that Lewis mentioned having a girlfriend, Geordie Shore star Marnie Simpson. \nAmmelia was taken aback when her friend Googled the reality star and discovered that he was living with the 25-year-old, who he met when he participated in the summer series of Big Brother. INSTAGRAM 12 Lewis posted this tribute to Marnie Simpson just hours before he begged another woman to spit vodka in to his mouth \nShe said: “I couldn’t believe it, when he got out of the toilet we asked him about having a girlfriend. \n“He said it’s not like that, it’s just for the money. \n“That’s why we stay together.” \nEarlier that day, Lewis posted a gushing tribute to the Geordie Shore star as she filmed scenes for the new series of the MTV show in Switzerland. THE SUN 12 Lewis was very touchy-feely with his new friend – and claimed his relationship with Marnie wasn’t all it seemed \nBut despite appearing like a devoted boyfriend online, that night in Ammelia’s hotel room was a different story. \nShe said: “I was so shocked when I found out that he had a girlfriend, but by that point we had already kissed several times. \n“He admitted that they lived together but stressed that they weren’t happy. \n“My friend and I really wanted him to leave the room – he’s so tall he seemed to take up all available space in there – but he just didn’t take the hint. INSTAGRAM After the gig, Lewis posted a picture taken of him and his friends at the Drake concert \n“He wouldn’t leave the room, and kept acting really pervy towards me. \n“Lewis kept saying ‘come and give me a cuddle’ and trying to kiss me – it actually became really annoying.” 12 The pair got together during Celebrity Big Brother in August and moved in together before Christmas \nShe added: “He said that he was going to pick her up from the airport on Monday but that meant that he had Friday, Saturday AND Sunday to take me out. \n“I was a bit taken aback.” \nWhen Ammelia refused to give Lewis her phone number, she claims he started following her on Instagram so that he could keep in touch and arrange to see her again. THE SUN Lewis and the girls in the hotel – his purple wristband from the O2 is clearly visible THE SUN 12 Later the same wristband is visible from beneath the covers of the girls’ bed as he kisses Ammelia \nAt about 4am Ammelia and her friend got in to their shared double bed, and she claims that Lewis eagerly climbed inside and began touching her suggestively. \nAmmelia said: “He got in to the bed and slid under the covers and was trying it on with me. \n“I kept pushing him off me, but he kept telling me ‘I’m not with Marnie’. \n“I was drunk too and eventually I did kiss him back.” THE SUN Lewis and Ammelia posed up for an Instagram picture together as their boozy night progressed \nShe added that he seemed eager to take things further but was respectful towards her. latest in TV and showbiz HEATING UP?
