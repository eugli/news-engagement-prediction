They fluctuate between us and a couple of other [churches] I think - they've only moved here recently and are just trying to settle in.\"I don't know them very well but they are nice people - they've got six children I think.\" \nRobertson admitted he was surprised to hear of the case in the US - a call from Stuff was the first he knew of it. \nThe District Attorney in the US alleges that the boy, Seth, died in a vomit soaked bed after a weeks-long illness that his parents failed to properly address, instead administering \"medical honey\" and praying over him. Facebook \nThe accused in their since-deleted Facebook profile image. \nTimothy and Sarah Johnson are accused of gross misdemeanour child neglect charges. \nThe couple didn't show up to their first court appearance on Tuesday in the US. A warrant was issued for their arrest on Thursday, with a bail set at US$12,000. \nA county attorney claimed the couple have fled to New Zealand. New Zealand police say they are aware of the case but refused to comment further. \nThe charges against the pair have a maximum sentence of one year in prison each. They stem from the death of their adopted son Seth, who died in March of 2015. \nHOW SETH DIED \nThe District Attorney alleges that Seth died in a vomit soaked bed after a weeks-long illness that his parents failed to properly address, instead administering \"medical honey\" and praying over him. \nDoctors found that he died of acute untreated pancreatis and possible sepsis. He had sores on his body indicating long periods of immobility. \nThe Johnsons told police they had noticed substantial changes in Seth's behaviour in the weeks leading up to his death, including shaking, lesions, insomnia, and self-harm. They told investigators Seth would throw himself down the stairs and hit his head. \nAccording to court documents, the pair did not seek medical attention for Seth as they had \"issues with going to doctors,\" instead undertaking their own research and diagnosing their son with post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury. \nThey also referred to a fetal alcohol syndrome diagnosis but no evidence has been found of said diagnosis. \nMedical honey and an antibiotic ointment were administered to Seth. \nOn the days leading up to his death on March 30 the Johnsons were out of town for a wedding, and left Seth in the care of their 16-year-old son, court documents show. \nHe called them up the day before Seth died to note that he was lethargic and was not eating, speaking, or getting out of bed. They considered leaving the wedding early but did not. \nUpon their return later that night Seth remained unresponsive, the court documents show. They prayed for his health and considered calling the authorities, but put off the decision till the morning, instead equipping an alarm that would alert them should he get up and off his mattress. \nThe next morning they awoke to find him covered in vomit and unresponsive. Emergency services were called but Seth was announced dead at the scene. \n\"We cannot comprehend how a parent would leave a very sick seven-year-old to the care of a 16-year-old so they can go away for a weekend,\" County Attorney Mike Freeman said in his statement. \n\"Nor can we comprehend how the parents refused to come home Sunday morning to care for their sick child when they were notified of his serious condition. Nor can we comprehend why the parents did not call an ambulance Sunday night to immediately obtain medical help when they finally got home.\" \nFUNERAL COSTS \nFollowing his death the Johnsons raised over NZ$9,000 to cover funeral costs on crowdfunding website YouCaring. \n\"Seth Mariano Johnson, our bright and beautiful boy, died unexpectedly on March 30th, 2015 at the age of 7 while at home,\" they wrote on the page. \n\"Most importantly, his parents taught him about God's love. What it meant to be loved. What it meant to give love. To be a child of grace. A child of God. Our time with Seth was too short. We miss him. But we rejoice when we think of his new home, and we are comforted knowing we will see him again.\" \nThe YouCaring page was taken down but a cached version shows at least US$7680 was raised. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:42:27.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
