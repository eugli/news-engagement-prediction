Jarrod Singh with the Durham Regional Police Service in Toronto responded to a call Sunday about a fight in downtown Oshawa, CBC Toronto reported. Instead of a fight, he stumbled upon the University of Ontario Institute of Technology dance troupe filming a music video, CBC reported. \n\"I saw eight people gathered around one person, so I can see how a member of the public thought it was a fight,\" Singh told CBC. \"But when I got closer I could see he was break dancing in the middle, and there was someone filming it.\" \nAfter checking out the scene, Singh decided to show the dancers his moves. \nNot too shabby!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T19:22:50.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
