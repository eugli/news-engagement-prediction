And it is the land ice - not the floating ice in a shelf - that adds to sea level rise.\nIf Larsen C were to go the same way it would continue a trend across the Antarctic Peninsula.\nIn recent decades, a dozen major ice shelves have disintegrated, significantly retreated or lost substantial volume - including Prince Gustav Channel, Larsen Inlet, Larsen A, Larsen B, Wordie, Muller, Jones Channel, and Wilkins.\nDr Paul Holland from BAS commented: \"Iceberg calving is a normal part of the glacier life cycle, and there is every chance that Larsen C will remain stable and this ice will regrow.\n\"However, it is also possible that this iceberg calving will leave Larsen C in an unstable configuration. If that happens, further iceberg calving could cause a retreat of Larsen C.\n\"We won't be able to tell whether Larsen C is unstable until the iceberg has calved and we are able to understand the behaviour of the remaining ice.\"\nThe removal of the ice would also enable scientists to study the uncovered seabed.\nWhen Larsen B broke away, the immediate investigation chanced upon new species.\nUnder the Antarctic Treaty, no fishing activity would be permitted in the area for 10 years.\nThe big bergs that break away from Antarctica are monitored from space.\nThey will often drift out into the Southern Ocean where they can become a hazard to shipping.\nThe biggest iceberg recorded in the satellite era was an object called B-15.\nCovering an area of some 11,000 sq km, it came away from the Ross Ice Shelf in 2000.\nSix years later fragments of the super-berg passed by New Zealand.\nIn 1956, a berg of roughly 32,000 sq km - bigger than Belgium - was spotted in the Ross Sea by a US Navy icebreaker. But there were no satellites at that time to follow up.\nMany of the bergs that break away from the Weddell Sea area of Antarctica get exported into the Atlantic. A good number get caught on the shallow continental shelf around the British overseas territory of South Georgia where they gradually wither away.\nThe study of the Larsen C Ice Shelf is led by Swansea University through its MIDAS Project , which involves BAS.\nThe remnants of many such bergs end up at South Georgia Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/#!/BBCAmos", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6BB9/production/_93677572_thinkstockphotos-91597079.jpg", "http://www.projectmidas.org/"], "published": "2017-02-22T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:50:11.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
