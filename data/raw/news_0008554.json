ICJ said Malaysia in reference to other conditions of Article 61, also asserted that the new fact was not known to Malaysia or to the Court when the\"Judgment\" was given because it was only discovered on review of the archival files of the British colonial administration after they were made available to the public by the UK National Archives after the judgment was rendered in 2008. \n\"Malaysia also argues that its ignorance of the new fact was not due to negligence as the documents in question were confidential documents which were inaccessible to the public until their release by the UK National Archives.\" \nMalaysia, ICJ said, asserted that its request was also in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Statute, in so far as the timing of its application was concerned. \n\"It indicates that the Application was being made within six months of the discovery of the new fact, since all of the documents that established this fact were obtained on or after Aug 4, 2016, and that it was also being submitted before the lapse of ten years from the Judgment date of May 23, 2008.\" \nICJ noted that Malaysia was requesting for the Court to adjudge and declare its application for revision of the 2008 judgment as admissible and asking it to \"fix time-limits to proceed with consideration of the merits of the application\". - Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:04:26.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
