The book was written by Steven I Wilkinson. \nThe media has misquoted him, the Times of India quoted Ghafoor as saying, adding the general didn't make any such comment about \"emulating India\". \nThe Nation's article last week had sent shockwaves through India and Pakistan, which has seen military rule in the recent past. \n\"Till now, there has been no attempt to portray Gen Bajwa as a parallel, competing powerhouse, with strong political undertones, unlike the past when an orchestrated campaign was directed and aimed at raising the profile of the then army chief to mythic proportions. \nâ€œGen Bajwa, through his public statements, has stressed that the army will support and assist the civilian government for national interest,\" TOI quoted the Nation article as saying.
