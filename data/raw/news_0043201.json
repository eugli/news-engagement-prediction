Featured alongside current runway stars including Mica Argañaraz and Adwoa Aboah was a series of modeling legends: Jan de Villeneuve, the 70-year-old British star who posed for David Bailey and Norman Parkinson, made an appearance, as did Benedetta Barzini, the Italian actress, model, and Irving Penn muse whose image helped to define 1960s standards of beauty. Fans of Peter Lindbergh’s evocative portraiture were sure to recognize Marie Sophie Wilson, whose otherworldly presence was regularly featured in magazines during the ’80s and ’90s, as well as Cecilia Chancellor, the perennial British stunner who has been an industry standard for more than three decades. Lest we forget, this was a week that began with an anti-age discrimination protest staged by older models. With the help of casting director Piergiorgio Del Moro, Rocha’s lineup felt both timely and nostalgic. By including women with impressive histories, Del Moro added another layer of enjoyment to the collection. Seeing Chancellor, Barzini, Wilson, and de Villeneuve in the show was a welcome trip down memory lane for veteran model fans, and for the social media generation, it was an introduction to fashion’s pre-digital age. Getting to know this modeling dream team via Rocha’s runway was its own reward.
