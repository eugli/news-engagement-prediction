I wanted to be a star … but I never really wanted to be someone else\") provided a mid-song interlude, and the pop legend stuck around on-screen to provide the climactic \"brought me to my knees\" high note in the second verse. Michael and Martin closed out the song together, singing the final chorus in a duet. \nIntroduced by Ridgeley as Michael's \"eternal eulogy,\" \"A Different Corner\" was Michael's first single as a solo artist in the U.S., though it still appeared Stateside on Wham!'s Music From the Edge of Heaven LP. It peaked at No. 7 on the Hot 100 in June of 1986. \nVideo will be added when it's available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:10:45.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
