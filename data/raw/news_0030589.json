Uber says that the requirement would have been unique to London, as none of their drivers are required to have cameras in any other Canadian community where they operate.\nThe London Taxi Association says they will have a response to the reversal on the cameras issue but that it will not involve job action. Originally some members of the taxi industry said that they would pull their service if the camera provision was scrapped.\nCaranci did not go into detail as to what their response will be.\nRelated Stories Rock, council, hard place; Uber threatens to leave, cab drivers threaten to halt services", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T17:03:12.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
