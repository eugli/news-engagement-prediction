I will remain neutral.” Article continues below Chelsea preparing £100m summer spending spree on three players [Mirror] \nSince retiring, Rosberg has taken on an ambassadorial role with Mercedes and has backed his team to continue their winning ways despite his departure and the massive overhaul in regulations for the coming season. \n“I will, of course, continue to follow developments and I’m looking forward to seeing the new car and will definitely be at the track for five or six races. I will continue to work with the sponsors. \n“We are simply the best team and have the best chance. But Red Bull and Ferrari can never be underestimated. I’m still a huge fan of our sport and I’m already excited about the first tests.” \nRosberg also took the opportunity to put an end to rumours he could feature in up-and-coming all-electric series Formula E, despite Mercedes potentially making the grid for the 2018/19 season. \n“No, I don’t think so,” he said when the question was raised. “I’m interested in Formula E. It’s certainly increasing very quickly. \n“We’re seeing how much success it’s having. It’s very new, it’s going in a different direction. It’s cool to follow. It has a good future and I’m definitely interested in it.” \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
