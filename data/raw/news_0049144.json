(Supplied: Facebook) \nThe mountain is a towering backdrop to Hobart and it is a popular destination for day trips. \nBut the area has remained largely undeveloped since the grand Springs Hotel was destroyed in the devastating 1967 bushfires . \nBusiness owner Megan Spillane sold coffee from a caravan at the site for 18 months before opening her new wood-clad shipping container cafe this week. \nMs Spillane said it was important for her and her business partner, husband Chris Spillane, the venture had minimal impact on the environment. \n\"I think that is one of the reasons it was approved,\" she said. \n\"If anything ever does go forward, it can just be picked up on a truck and taken away.\" \nShe said it was a great honour to be open the first cafe at the site in 50 years. \n\"We are making history I guess ... it is pretty special.\" \nAt The Springs site on Tuesday morning, reaction to the venture was mixed. \nHobart residents Michelle Izard and her husband Brent Norris supported more tourism ventures at the site. \n\"This is revolutionary for the mountain really. To actually get a hot drink and have somewhere to stop on the way up is fantastic,\" Ms Izard said. \nItalian tourist Lorenzo Barini, who planned to hike up to Mount Wellington's summit with his German friend Johanna Kayser, disagreed. \n\"I hate this kind of stuff, I think that cafes spoil the atmosphere,\" he said. \n\"I think city stuff should stay in the city, if you want to go out of the city there is a reason, you do not want to see the same stuff.\" Photo: The Springs Motel was one of many buildings lost in the Black Tuesday bushfires of February 7, 1967. (Supplied: Marjory Woolford) Permanent developments under consideration \nCommercial tourism ventures at Mount Wellington have been a controversial issue, with some people fearing the area's natural beauty will be ruined by developers. \nTwo other much discussed tourism ventures, a cable car and a hotel at The Springs site, are on hold .

(ABC News: Rhiana Whitson) \nA government spokesman said a decision on Mount Wellington Cableway Company's proposal would be announced \"in due course\". \nHobart City Mayor Sue Hickey said architect Robert Morris-Nunn's proposal to build a 60-room hotel at The Springs site was deferred pending the outcome of the cable car decision.

(ABC News: Rhiana Whitson) \n\"There is a lot of drama trying to do any construction on the mountain, let alone public opinion, you have to get through the ownership of the councils, which is between Glenorchy and Hobart, and there is also the Mount Wellington Trust,\" she said. \n\"A lot of people go up ... and do not realise that there are not any facilities for a drink or something to eat.\" \nA spokesman for the anti-cable car group Respect the Mountain welcomed the opening of the cafe and said the lobby group had long since pushed for an information centre. \n\"The Springs has historically been a common entry node to the mountain. It is inclusive location means that visitors that are walking or cycling the many tracks or visiting the summit can all access information on the area,\" the spokesman said.
