While some states have similar demarcation on the licenses of undocumented immigrants, activists say the breadth of Georgia’s proposal is unprecedented . \nUS border agents could make refugees and visa holders give social media logins Read more \n“[This] is the first time that I’ve heard of any state considering … passing this kind of divisive action,” said Naomi Tsu, referencing the bill’s focus on immigrants living here entirely lawfully. Tsu is the deputy legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s (SPLC) Immigrant Justice Project. “We’re pretty concerned about this idea of branding some residents with a ‘scarlet letter’.”\nRepresentative Alan Powell, who sponsored the provision, cited preventing non-citizens from registering to vote as one of the bill’s merits. “I don’t care if you’re a regional vice president for Mercedes,” Powell said before the the motor vehicles committee passed the bill, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution . Powell noted that for non-citizens in the US that are able to get a driver’s license, “it at least ought to have on there ‘non-citizen’”. \nGeorgia’s department of driver services already issues distinct licenses to non-citizens that have the words “limited term” printed on the card, according to the department . ( Twelve states allow undocumented immigrants to have driver’s licenses. Georgia is not one of them.) \nTsu said: “We’ve just got to ask ourselves, ‘What good is going to come of this bill?’ ... It only exists to put up differences between people.” \nThis isn’t the first time this sort of branding has been threatened against immigrants, though previous legislation has focused on undocumented immigrants. In 2013, the North Carolina legislature considered placing a pink stripe across licenses held by undocumented persons, but faced pushback by immigrants’ rights advocates.\nThe bill “calls into question” Georgia’s reputation as being a welcoming state –including toward businesses, said Tsu. \nCould US local government curb Trump's worst excesses? Read more \nThe proposed legislation comes amid groundless concerns about widespread voter fraud . Trump blamed his loss of the popular vote in last year’s presidential elections on fraudulent votes cast against him by undocumented immigrants. In Georgia, where more than 4m votes were cast, officials have opened investigations into only 25 cases. \nOne-third of the almost 900 reports of harassment and intimidation the SPLC received in the 10 days following the election were directed towards immigrants, said Tsu.\n“With President Trump’s Muslim ban and other executive orders that affect immigration, it’s continuing to play out this real sense of ‘us versus them’, when really here we’re talking about people who should be part of ‘us’,” said Tsu.\n“They’re people who are here lawfully … and yet there’s this sense that they need to be labeled and divided and pushed out.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T17:03:40.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
