Revenue: $2.28 billion vs. $2.19 billion expected by Thomson Reuters. \nIn a letter to shareholders , the company said it received a record number of orders for its Model S sedan and Model X sport utility, and it expects to deliver 47,000 -50,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in the first half of the year. \nCash increased by $300 million, from $3.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. \nThe company plans to produce 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week before the end of the fourth quarter of this year, and reach 10,000 per week \"at some point in 2018,\" Tesla said in its shareholder letter. \nLater this year, Tesla will also finalize locations for its third, fourth, and possibly a fifth Gigafactories — the company has one Gigafactory in Nevada, where it makes batteries and will make Model 3 component, and a second factory in New York where it makes solar power products. \nThe solar business, resulting from the acquisition of SolarCity, added $77 million of cash in the six weeks following the close of the deal. \nThe Model 3 rollout represents a big step for the company, as it will mark Tesla's transition — in the auto industry — from a small niche manufacturer of high end electric vehicles to a mass market manufacturer.
