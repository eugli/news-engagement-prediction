There cannot be a separate law for any one,\" the RSS leader added. \nIndresh also had a personal poser for Nitish and Lalu, \"Will they allow their sons to give talaq to their wives?\" \nIndresh said that those, who are against one nation-one law theory, are free to leave the country for any other place. \nA debate has emerged over the government's stand to oppose the practice of triple talaq in Islam with some leaders including Lalu and Nitish accusing the ruling dispensation of making unnecessary noise over the issue. \nNitish and Lalu have also spoken against the introduction of Uniform Civil Code (UCC) -- a proposal that seeks to replace the personal laws based on the scriptures and customs of each community with a common set governing every citizen.
