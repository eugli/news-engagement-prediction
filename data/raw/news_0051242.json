I hadn’t been to Nashville before — I drove in with everything I owned in tow. I wanted more mild weather. But I was shocked by the cost of rent. The market just didn’t seem ready for the city’s big population boom. \nDid you buy right away? \nAt first, I rented this little house, sight unseen, but when I got there I said, “Oh no, this isn’t going to work.” After a couple of months, I kept seeing these cute houses for sale, and I looked into what it takes to buy, to see if I could do this. After realizing I could more or less pay a mortgage for what I was paying in rent, I took the leap. It all went so fast. In the end, I pay $100 more a month to own a house double the size of my rental, in a safer neighborhood, on nearly an acre of land. \nHow did you save for it? \nBecause I used an FHA loan for first-time home buyers, my down payment was a lot lower. And it helps that my boyfriend pays rent. \nBut buying this house actually came at one of the most broke times in my life — a good chunk of my savings went into moving and reestablishing in Nashville. So I buy smart. I budget. I keep my day-to-day living expenses fairly low, and save the rest. I’m a huge thrifter, so I’m not distracted by shiny new things. I have a 2006 Jeep that’s paid off. I went to a state college where I could get in-state tuition and a state scholarship. My story isn’t one of privilege or wealth — I literally worked hard and saved. \nDid you have to give up anything? \nMy only sacrifice would be that in consumer terms, I did not buy all the stuff that my peers did. I don’t go out every weekend, I make coffee at home, hang out at friends’ houses, and watch movies on Netflix . \nWhat did you feel when you moved into your own place? \nPride. There’s a confidence that comes from making things happen on your own. I’m having so much fun DIY-ing my space. I’m starting a garden this spring. I’m cooking more. What no one tells you is that unless your house is brand new, you will want to change things — and once you do, you’ll want to keep going. I just ripped up my cabinets, and I’m about to go home and sand the walls that I just puttied. \nGabriella Cuzzola, 27 — bought a condo in Jersey City Heights, N.J., with her husband Job: Works on special events at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and as a real-estate agent Income: Around $175,000 combined Home price: $380,000 Down payment: 10% Mortgage: 30-year fixed at 3.75%. (“I thought we had locked in a 3.65% but we forgot a signature. It was so upsetting, so frustrating. Freaking paperwork.”) Family status: Engaged \nWhy did you buy? \nI loved living in the Hoboken, N.J., area, but rent was so high and I felt like I was throwing money away. It didn’t feel smart. My fiancé and I saw Jersey City Heights as an up-and-coming area where we could get more space and still be close to our old neighborhood. We were seeing cool bars and restaurants slowly pop up and it felt like a good investment. \nHow did you save for it? \nWe actually got engaged right around the time we were starting to seriously discuss buying a place. My parents were generously going to be paying for a large part of our wedding, so they encouraged us to take that money and use it toward the down payment — we originally weren’t going to be able to put down 10%. \nUnlike a lot of other people in our generation, we didn’t have a lot of student loans, and we just finished paying them back. But that pushed back when we could save up enough. We also cut back on traveling and spending in general as best we could. \nI took on a second, part-time job as a real estate agent the summer before we bought our condo, working a lot of nights and weekends. All the money I made went right toward the down payment and closing costs. Another benefit of being an agent: We bought the condo from someone we knew, who wanted to cut out the realtor and sell the place by owner so he wouldn’t have to pay commission. If we’d had to use an outside agent, he would have priced the place a bit higher. \nWe also have two friends who are living with us right now during our first year and contributing toward the monthly costs. Because we have roommates, we are able to save that money throughout this year and use it toward wedding costs. \nIs that a big sacrifice? \nWe are really lucky that the people we live with are our good friends, so it ends up being a lot of fun. Working a second job and living with roommates can be stressful, for sure. But I would never change the decision we made, because we’re in such a better financial position. \nHow does it feel to live in a house you own? \nWe are really lucky that my dad has built and renovated houses, so we call him a lot. We’ve already done some big projects, and learned some lessons. I think that was part of my reason for wanting to own something – there are a ton of life skills you need to learn to be able to maintain your home, and I wanted us to get started on that. \nTanner Callais, 32 — bought a single-family home in Austin Job: Runs a cruise travel website .
