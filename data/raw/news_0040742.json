Valentines Day: Strictly a woman’s affair? On 9:17 pm In News , Woman by Okogba Comments \nMrs. Anuli Obijiaku , School proprietress, Cuddly Kids, Amuwo-Odofin, Lagos. \nValentine’s Day celebration is marked everyday in my home though, but February 14, each year is special in my house because it is my first child’s birthday. I do not believe Valentine’s day should be strictly a woman’s affair despite the fact that people believe buying gifts should be strictly a man’s thing. Despite the economic situation in the country, couples needed to unwind just to ease pressure. This, I think should not also be elaborate because no money in the country. •Funke Osae-Brown and Egbunike Fidelia Obijiaku \nFunke Osae-Brown , founder, The Luxury Reporter, an online portal. \nValentines Day fell on a week day. I spent most of the working hour during the day attending to some official assignments in the office. Later in the evening, it was a mini celebration in-house with my husband and children, popped a bottle of wine and unwind. For us in my family, everyday is Valentine’s Day because we share love among ourselves everyday. Love defines us, we live it. I believe Valentine’s Day should be a woman’s affair because women deserve to be celebrated more often. I don’t think men celebrate us enough \nPaulina Eje , Makurdi \nValentine’s day should not be really centered around boy friend or girl friend. It is something you can still do on any other day. But if you are a lady and are in love with a guy and you feel you must show him you love him on a special day, you do not have to wait for him to make the first move. You could just surprise him. It spices up the relationship. \nOluwole Asetoye , Warri \nPersonally I took my wife out just to make her day. The major difference between this years Valentine’s celebration and the last was financial constraint. Having less money made it more fun because we had to think of exciting things to do. It has even made our love wax stronger. Okogba ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:11:00.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
