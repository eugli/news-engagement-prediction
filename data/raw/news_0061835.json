Just moments after McGeary defeated Brett McDermott at UFC 173 on Friday night, the promotion announced that he will turn around and face Linton Vassell on May 19 in London. The 34-year old McGeary (12-1) defeated McDermott via second-round TKO (doctor stoppage) in Belfast at Bellator 173, in his first bout back since losing the title against Phil Davis in November. Linton, a fellow Englishman, is riding a two-fight win streak, his latest coming against Francis Carmont in November. Overall “The Swarm” Vassell has won three of his last four, with a victory over Emanuel Newton also in his resume. Bellator 173 will take place at the SSE Arena in London, England, and will feature a headlining bout between welterweights Rory MacDonald and Paul Daley. Also announced for the card is a bout between Derek Anderson and British phenom, Michael Page.
