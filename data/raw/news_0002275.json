Now you (Modi Government) have all the money and at least give Rs 15,000 to people instead of 15 lakh,” he added. \nEarlier on January 29, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh in their maiden joint road show in Lucknow shared tight hugs and warm handshake besides donning same coloured jackets. \nIf the PM was targeteted by Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati lost no time on training guns on the Akhilesh government, accusing it of failing to provide adequate security in the state.
