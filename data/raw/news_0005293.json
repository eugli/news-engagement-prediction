Shhh, she’s busy stepping in it again, let her. @sallykohn Calling this a \"Muslim Ban\" is pretty disingenuous. Did you read the proposal? \n— Jamie Bloom (@JamieBloom_) February 2, 2017 \nOf course she didn’t. It’s much easier to scream about MEAN OL’ TRUMP than to actually read and understand what’s happening here with the order. If she read it her outrage would look stupid … well, it still looks stupid, just not to her. @sallykohn @sox_morgan didnt obama bomb 5 of those 7 countries and ban cuban refugees and iraqis? Why no outrage then? Hypocrite \n— Luv'n America!!! (@bberube10) February 2, 2017 \nObama bombed more countries than W. did, but hey, it’s okay when a president she likes blows stuff up. \n— Beaver Falls Hosiery (@subBurgher) February 2, 2017 \nSo sweet. Ha! @sallykohn not a Muslim ban. Also, remember when it was disrespectful to not call the president the president? Being honest is so hard! \n— Bob Butts (@realbobbutts) February 3, 2017 \nHonesty is not a strong point on the Left. @sallykohn So you don't believe terrorism is a fundamental threat?
