Terrill/Associated Press Scott Polacek Featured Columnist February 28, 2017 The New York Mets are in Florida for spring training, but general manager Sandy Alderson told reporters Tuesday that third baseman David Wright is in New York with a \"right shoulder impingement.\" Anthony DiComo of MLB .com noted Alderson said Wright \"won't throw for 'a couple weeks'\" and called him questionable for Opening Day. Injuries are nothing new for Wright, and it is fair to worry about physical problems for the 34-year-old as the Mets chase a third straight postseason appearance. He dealt with a herniated disc in 2016 and played just 37 games after he appeared in only 38 games in 2015 because of spinal stenosis. Wright hit .226 with seven home runs in limited action last year. The third baseman has struggled to establish consistency in recent years because of injuries, but he was a dangerous force in his prime as one of the faces of the Mets franchise. He counts seven campaigns with a batting average better than .300 and five with more than 25 home runs on his resume. Wright, a seven-time All-Star and winner of two Gold Gloves and two Silver Slugger awards, provides a veteran presence in the locker room with 24 postseason games under his belt. The Mets will likely turn toward a combination of Wilmer Flores and Jose Reyes if Wright misses significant time. Flores hit .267 with 16 home runs as a versatile contributor in 2016, while Reyes provides veteran experience and versatility. While Flores and Reyes can carry the load in the short term for New York, Wright is an established star who can help lead the Mets back to the postseason if he returns to health.
