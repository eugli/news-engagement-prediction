I was just over the limit.'\nOn his two successful bids to return to the US, Tun admitted he paid 'coyotes' to smuggle him across the border. After his first deportation he spent $8,000, while his second attempt was $5,000.\nHe said in his experience, Donald Trump's planned wall along the border is bound to fail claiming the human traffickers will simply charge more money for the inconvenience it poses.\nDistrict Attorney George Brauchler, Tun's case is not unique.\nHe said: 'There’s no more patience or forgiveness. People get outraged and they are entitled to get outraged. Does anybody think he’s not coming back? Why would you have any hope of that?'\nHe added: 'If someone wants to come into our country from the southern border they just do. There’s very little we can do to dissuade or stop them.'", "external_links": ["http://denver.cbslocal.com/2017/02/02/5-duis-deported-twice-but-still-in-colorado/"], "published": "2017-02-03T14:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:17:30.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
