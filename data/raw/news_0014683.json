Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nAmazon \nTVs are a pretty major purchase. Unlike smartphones, which most people upgrade every two years, or computers, where many people upgrade every five or six, a TV can easily last a decade. \nThey're by far the biggest screens in our house, and they get used for a lot of different tasks, whether it's displaying regular broadcast TV or playing video games. \nBut that doesn't mean you have to spend a fortune on one. \nYou certainly can , however, there are some good TVs out there that cost 1/6 the price of that $3,000 LG model. There's no question that they won't be as good, but if you're a true videophile, no budget TV is likely to please you. \nThese three TVs are solid choices if you're looking for a good screen, a few extras, and, most importantly, a good price. TCL 32-Inch 720p Roku Smart LED TV Amazon \nThis is the perfect TV for someone who's just looking for a decent-sized screen in a smaller room, like a guest bedroom or dorm. Its 32 inches is more than sufficient if you're watching from only a few feet away. It's not full HD, but it won't matter as much on a smaller screen.With three HDMI ports, you won't have any trouble if you use this TV for watching actual TV, playing video games on multiple consoles, and connecting your computer.It also has a Roku built into the TV, so not only do you have access to a ton of streaming services, you don't have to buy a separate set-top box or dongle to make your TV smart. At this price, it's hard to argue with what you're getting: a good sized screen, smart functionality, and a good number of inputs. TCL 55-Inch 1080p Roku Smart LED TV Amazon \nThis is the last TV's bigger sibling, and while it carries all the benefits of the smaller TCL set I've recommend, it has a couple of extras that make it worth a look. The first is that it's huge. I have a 50-inch TV in my apartment and I'm constantly amazed at its size.Second, it's a full 1080P screen; at this size, the difference between 720p and 1080p is noticeable. This is the kind of TV that you want in your living room: It's big, smart, and has the same three HDMI port setup that ensures you'll have enough inputs for all of your gadgets. LG 43-Inch 4K Smart LED TV, $447, available at Amazon Amazon \nIf you're making the leap to 4K, and I suggest you do , a good TV in this price range is this model from LG.It's 43 inches, which is plenty big for an apartment or bedroom, it has 3 HDMI ports, which is enough for most people, and it's a smart TV.Its best feature is arguably the fact that it supports HDR (High Dynamic Range), something that's just coming to most TVs now. HDR offers richer color reproduction, and better black levels. Both of those make the picture more rich and lifelike.
