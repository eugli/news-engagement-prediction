Nothing to complain about,” the president vowed.\n“Obamacare, remember — it is a disaster,” he added.\nTrump: We will submit \"a great health care plan that's going to take the place of the disaster known as Obamacare\" https://t.co/cZogIonewA\n— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) February 18, 2017\nTrump, throughout his campaign for president both in the Republican primaries and general election, vowed that if he ever got elected to the White House, a “repeal and replace” of Obamacare would be his number one priority — a similar promise congressional Republicans have made for years.\nPrior to taking office last month and shortly afterward, the Trump administration appeared they planned to make good on their health care promises in record time. However, their momentum has since slowed.\nTrump even said in a pre-Super Bowl interview with Fox News host Bill O’Reilly that Americans may have to wait until the end of 2017 or 2018 to see an Obamacare replacement.\nIt’s also unclear when the ailing health care law will be repealed by Congress, although the Trump White House, along with most GOP congressmen, have said they want the law to be simultaneously repealed and replaced, ensuring that the 20 million Americans who gained health care access under former President Barack Obama’s law don’t lose their health insurance.\nStill, the first major executive order that Trump signed following his inauguration sought to loosen regulations on the health care industry, which many pointed as the first step toward uprooting the law.\nSince, reports indicate that the IRS under Trump’s leadership won’t reject tax returns that fail to answer the questions about health care coverage, which were mandated under Obama.", "external_links": ["https://t.co/cZogIonewA", "https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/833088172653498368", "http://reason.com/blog/2017/02/14/irs-blow-to-obamacare-individual-mandate"], "published": "2017-02-19T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T16:50:50.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
