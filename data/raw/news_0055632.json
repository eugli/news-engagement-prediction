By Rebecca Murray Updated May 05, 2016 . \nWhen it came time to put together a top list of horror films, compiling this 'Best Of' list was relatively easy.

You're a brave moviegoer if you can make it through all ten without screaming. © Warner Home Video Buy from Amazon \nIt's impossible to put together a Top 10 Horror Movies list without placing The Exorcist at or near the top. Linda Blair stars as the young daughter of an actress (played by Ellen Burstyn) whose imaginary friend turns out to be the Devil.

Looking back on it now, it's not as scary as The Exorcist and other horror classics. But since I still remember how much it scared me back then, it deserves a spot on this list.
