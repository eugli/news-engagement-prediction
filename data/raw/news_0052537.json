Emmanuel Macron visited No 10 for talks with Mrs May today as part of a visit to London to canvass 200,000 French voters in the British capital. He is leading the race for the Elys√©e Palace in an improbable run as an independent that appears set to see him overhaul the establishment parties to reach a head to head contest with the Front National's Marine Le Pen. Mr Macron quit Francois Hollande's Socialist government to campaign as an independent and is now set to beat both the Socialists and Republicans to the final round. Emmanuel Macron, the front runner for the French presidency, dropped into No 10 for talks with Theresa May, telling her he was committed to a 'fair Brexit' Mr Macron is the improbable front runner and appears set to overhaul the establishment parties to contest the run off with Front National candidate Marine Le Pen Downing Street said it had been happy to accommodate Mr Macron's request for a meeting but said the non-engagement policy with Ms Le Pen's far right party was unchanged. Speaking outside No 10 after his talks, Mr Macron said he assured Mrs May of his willingness to seek a 'fair execution of Brexit' which protects and defends French and European interests. And he reaffirmed his intention to co-operate with the UK on defence under an 'improved' Le Touquet deal.
