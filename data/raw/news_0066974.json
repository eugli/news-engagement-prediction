Save LG \nThe problem with having a smartphone that you want to use all the damn time is that you'll spend a big chunk of your day wedded to an outlet . LG believes that nobody should have to suffer such an indignity, and has launched the X power2 as a remedy. The smartphone is designed to operate for an entire weekend on a single charge thanks to the 4,500mAh battery tucked inside. It'll also recharge nice and quick, too, taking just two hours to go from flat all the way back up to 100 percent. \nUnfortunately, like the first-generation LG X power phone , the capacious battery is the only noteworthy thing about it. The 5.5-inch display has a HD resolution, and is using an off-brand 1.5Ghz octa-core chip that we're guessing is made by MediaTek. In addition, there's either 1.5GB or 2GB RAM paired with 16GB storage, which will hardly pull up any trees when most flagships are packing twice that amount.Rounding out the spec list is a reasonably-decent 13 megapixel primary camera and a five megapixel wide-angle front facer. You'll also get barebones LTE connectivity along with 802.11 b/g/n WiFi and Bluetooth 4.2, so nothing much of interest here. On the upside, the device runs Android 7.0, and shouldn't be too expensive, since it's one of LG's mass-market devices, although there's no word on actual pricing. For comparison, the first-generation X power cost just $150, making it a decent backup device for road warriors.The LG X power2 will launch in March in Latin America, and will subsequently roll out to \"key markets\" in the US, Asia and Europe soon after.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T15:51:39.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
