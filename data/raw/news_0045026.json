Truex, USA Swimming programs and services director, told NBC News. \"We hope that it speaks to any Asian-American athlete or family regardless of where they are in this progression. If we have a family signing up for swimming lessons, we want the guide to speak for them. If we have Asian Americans already in the pipeline, we want them to know...we're thinking about programming and services that will benefit them.\" July 2, 2016; Omaha, NE, USA; Nathan Adrian at the start of the men's 50m freestyle finals in the U.S. Olympic swimming team trials at CenturyLink Center. Rob Schumacher / Reuters \nUSA Swimming has released a total of four cultural inclusion resource guides — including ones for the LGBTQ , African-American, and Hispanic/Latino communities — to provide resources and mentorship programs to underrepresented groups in sports. The organization also plans to release a fifth guide for Native American communities. \nAccording to the most recent guide, a total of 339,903 year-round athletes are currently registered with USA Swimming, the national governing body and member service organization for the sport of swimming. Of that number, approximately 5.3 percent — 18,107 — are Asian-American or Pacific Islander. Sixty-six percent of Asian Americans don't know how to swim, according to USA Swimming. An infographic taken from the USA Swimming \"Asian American Cultural Inclusion Resource Guide\" \nBarriers to swimming participation identified by research referenced in the guide includes fear, swimming ability, physical appearance, parental influence, access to role models, and access to athletic facilities. \n\"It's really trying to create communication and education between USA Swimming and the community we're trying to reach to understand what's the motivation and what are some of the barriers, and trying to create ways to collaboratively figure out how to bridge the gap and attract them to the pool,\" Truex said. \nOne of the goals of the USA Swimming guide is to also retain current athletes by providing diverse role models, Truex said.

That person or that coach can be me.'\" \nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and Tumblr .
