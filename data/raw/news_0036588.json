Share Save \nNews keeps trickling in for the Switch as we await its public release next month. Befitting a Nintendo console, they range from exciting to bizarre , often taking the system's novel points and running into unpredictable territory. Such is the case with the upcoming Ultra Street Fighter II , as a new video emerged confirming rumors that we will, at last, get a first-person hadoken-throwing experience. \nAlright, it's not perfect. The latest episode of Capcom TV showcased the new mode, \"Way Of The Hado,\" which looks more like a House Of The Dead-style rail shooter than the fluid combat Street Fighter is known for. The host ends up flinging his motion-control Joy-Con controllers around to erratically activate Ryu's trademark fireball, uppercut and spin-kick special moves to take down waves of Shadaloo grunts. Maybe the activation gestures will get tightened up before release, but the video gave me flashbacks to the controller-flailing heydey of Wii Sports when precision took a backseat to spastic jabs and prayers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:50:51.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
