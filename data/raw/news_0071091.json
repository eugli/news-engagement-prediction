Albert Morales will meet Andre Soukhamthath in a bantamweight matchup and Cynthia Calvillo takes on Amanda Cooper at Las Vegas’ T-Mobile Arena. MMAJunkie initially reported the fights on Thursday. Morales (6-1-1) is still searching for his first UFC victory in his third fight. He drew with Alejandro Perez in September and was TKOd in a wild slugfest against Thomas Almeida in November. The Rhode Island-based Soukhamthath (11-3), brings a three-fight win streak, all via knockout, into his UFC debut. Cooper has an official record of 2-2, but that doesn’t count her pair of exhibition wins on The Ultimate Fighter 23. The Michigan native reached the finals, where she lost to Tatiana Suarez . Cavillo (3-0), from San Jose, joins the UFC just seven months after her pro debut. Two of her three wins are via finish. UFC 209, which is headlined by the Tyron Woodley - Stephen Thompson welterweight title rematch, is now finalized with 12 bouts.
