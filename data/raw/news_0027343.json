Clamber down the steep, narrow staircase to cross the threshold of this Gothic-style 19th-century wine cellar- the oldest in London. Although located on busy Villiers Street, this institution of a wine bar (and former home of Rudyard Kipling) is preceded by an anonymous, even derelict-looking exterior. With nothing but a few cobweb-covered jars in a neglected window, only the faint lettering that begrudgingly spells the word 'Gordon's' invites you in. Downstairs, Londoners in the know huddle beneath low arches and antique clocks to enjoy wines from across the globe by candlelight. Besides the myriad of wines on offer, Gordon's has a noteworthy selection of sherry, port and Madeira served from wooden casks behind the bar. Also available is a variety of light dishes and continental cheeses with a generous hunk of French bread and butter.
