He is dressed in jeans, a dark shirt and a pale blazer, with a black backpack slung over his shoulder. \nOnce he arrives at the entrance of the departure lobby, he stops momentarily to look up at the flight schedules. \nAfter checking the flight schedules, he then moves to a nearby self-check-in kiosk. \nIn a flash, the next scene shows two women approaching Kim, one in a whitetop appearing to lunge as she places her hand over Kin’s face. There is a flurry of movement, then after a matter of two ir three seconds, the three break apart. \nThe woman in white - whose hair and dress resembles a woman dressed in a top with an “LOL” slogan who Malaysian police said was connected to the killing - walks briskly away. \nThe other woman cannot be seen. \nThe footage then shows Kim approaching two policeman, who lead him to a medical clinic in the airport. There is then another flurry involving a stretcher, but the details cannot be seen. \nMalaysian police say four suspects linked to the killing of Kim have fled the country. \n“I confirm today the perpetrators, the four suspects are from North Korea (without diplomatic passports) have left our country on the same day (of Kim Jong Nam’s killing),” said police inspector Noor Rashid Ibrahim at a press conference on Sunday. \nIn addition to the four suspects who fled the country, police are looking for three other new suspects, whose pictures were displayed at the conference. \nOf these three, one has already been identified as a North Korean national. \nMalaysia also shot back at North Korea’s allegations that authorities were purposely delaying the investigation, including the release of Kim Jong Nam’s remains. \n“North Korea can say anything, but, as far as we are concerned, we follow the legal requirements of our country,” Noor Rashid said. \nPyongyang is behind the death, a South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman alleged Sunday. \n“The government assumes that North Korea’s regime is behind the incident,” Defense Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon Hee said, adding that there would be no further comment while Malaysian police conduct their investigation. \nKim Jong-nam, the 45-year-old eldest of former dictator Kim Jong-il’s three sons, had been due to travel from Kuala Lumpur to Macau last Monday but was apparently killed when he was sprayed with a poisonous substance at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. \nMalaysian police previously said the investigation can’t be concluded until the person’s family comes forward to identify him. \nAuthorities are waiting on pathology and toxicology test results to determine the exact cause of death. \nNoor Rashid mentioned that Malaysian authorities are not investigating based on politics but merely trying to understand why the killing took place in Malaysia.
