Nigel Farage \nNigel Farage has posted a picture of himself dining with Donald Trump in Washington DC. \nThe former UKIP leader dined with the President, his family and close advisors at Trump International Hotel, less than a mile from The White House . \nMr Farage was in the United States to address the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) where he spoke of the “global revolution” that started with Brexit. \nReferring to the “Brexit mania” he had seen in the US he said: “I’m proud to be part of that campaign, I really am.” \nHe told the crowd the UK’s “real friends” speak English, in a comment seemingly aimed at the European Union. \nIn the picture, posted on Mr Farage’s twitter feed, he appears to be dining with the US president, his daughter Ivanka, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Govenor Rick Scott. Dinner with The Donald. pic.twitter.com/KAdvZ84d2Y — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) February 26, 2017 \nHe captioned the post: “Dining with The Donald”. \nIt is not the first time Mr Farage has been pictured in the company of the US President. \nIn November he caused a stir when he was pictured meeting Mr Trump at Trump Tower in New York City, making him the first British politician to meet the newly elected president. \nFollowing the meeting Mr Trump shocked Westminster with a late-night tweet declaring that Mr Farage would do a “great job” as Britain’s ambassador to the US and that “many people” wanted to see him as the UK’s senior diplomat in Washington.
