He led the team to 5-11 and a fourth-place district finish in his first year; this season, the Stallions are 2-11 headed into the postseason.\nIn addition to directing the Florida Vipers, McThay, 32, coaches the 17-and-under team for the top-10 nationally ranked AAU program. His father said McThay is taking on additional duties with the club, which plays on the Under Armour Association summer circuit and last week was ushered into its new home — DS Sportsplex, a 72,000-square-foot facility in Deerfield Beach.\nUse of the facility, located at 3650 SW 10th St. and also housing the Developmental Volleyball Academy, will be part of McThay's expanded role with the Vipers.\nLast July, the Vipers' U-17 team — made up mostly of South Florida high school basketball standouts — competed at the UAA nationals in Atlanta and also advanced to the national semifinals of the Las Vegas Fab 48 tournament.\nCalvary Christian 7-footer Victor Uyaelunmo (Southern Cal signee), Westminster Academy forward Jason Strong (Northeastern), Dillard forward RaiQuan Gray (Florida State), St. Andrew's guard Anthony Polite (FSU) and Calvary guard Jerald Butler (Butler) played key roles on the squad.\nThe Vipers' seventh-grade team, meanwhile, won the 2016 national championship in Atlanta.\n\"This new facility will help by enhancing our exposure, building relationships and partnerships,\" Brandon McThay said. \"I will be able to reach out to more kids and impact more families within our community by having more space and flexibility.\"\nThe Vipers will have nine boys teams (grades 3-11) in 2017 and four girls squads. Tryouts for the Vipers' boys 9th-11th grade squads will be held Feb. 26.\nDS Sportsplex is not open to the public, owner Larry Dezenzo said.\n\"It is like a training center\" for basketball and volleyball, Dezenzo said, with eight indoor hoops courts and eight for volleyball. The complex, which will have sports medicine staff on hand, will also host elite performance training by Fast Twitch.\n\"This is the only place like this in the state of Florida,\" Dezenzo said.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-58992d40/turbine/fl-hs-bb-vipers-new-gym-0207-20170206"], "published": "2017-02-07T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:24:18.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
