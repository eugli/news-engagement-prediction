The television had been sitting on the property for more than a year.\nThe items were ultimately handed over to police. Officers were able to use the banking records to locate the owner.\nThe owner, a 68-year-old man from Bolsover, Ont., which is located near Kawartha Lakes, told police that he had put the money in the television for safe keeping.\nThe man says he forgot about the cash and eventually the television was given to a family friend, who brought it to the recycling centre.\nPolice are thanking the employees at GEEP for their honesty.\nPhotos A sign for the Barrie Police Service can be seen in Barrie, Ont. on Tuesday, Sept.15, 2015.
