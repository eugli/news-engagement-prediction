Our IT sector would not have been successful if we did not have skilled professionals from India,” he said. \nSoon after taking over last month, Trump had decided to overhaul the work visa programmes like the H-1B and L1, a move that will adversely hit the lifeline of Indian tech firms and professionals in the US. \nPressing for early resumption of negotiations for the EU -India Broad-based Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA), McAllister said the delegation urged Indian leaders to resume the talks as the pact will significantly boost two-way trade. \n“We deeply regret that we are not being able to move ahead. We will use the visit to call for resumption of talks for the agreement,” he told reporters. \nThe EU delegation, the second one in India, will hold talks with a number of Union ministers, national security adviser Ajit Doval, the vice chairman of NITI Ayog Arvind Panagariya and Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan, among others.
