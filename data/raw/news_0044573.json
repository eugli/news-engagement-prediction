I think as his game continues to develop and mature, you'll see him make less mistakes, whether it's [in the field] or on the bases.\" \nBen Zobrist , who was bumped from second base to the outfield, understands how talented Baez is. \n\"He's such an elite defender, you have to have him in there,\" Zobrist said. \"You have to feel good about that as a team guy. \n\"Last year, I played second for the first half of the year and then I moved around in the second half,\" Zobrist said. \"I kind of expect that. If there are injuries or things, there are times when I will get entrenched in one position a little longer. When you have guys rise to the occasion who play certain positions, I could be moved around, too. That's Javy last year at the end of the season and in the postseason. He did such a phenomenal job for us, we have to get him in there. He's such an elite defender.

Last spring, Baez asked the super-utility veteran how he prepared for different positions. \n\"It was the same way I was doing it -- during [batting practice], go out there and shag and take ground balls, just look at the angle that the ball's going to be in and be ready for it,\" Baez said. \nBut Baez also noted Zobrist has more pregame work to do as an older player. \n\"I can just get to the field and be ready to go,\" Baez said. \nAnd Zobrist? \n\"I feel like I need a month and a half to get ready for the season,\" Zobrist said about the difference between himself and his young teammates. \"I know if I do the right things that I need to do and take care of the rest part of Spring Training, too, I'll be ready to go in April.\" has covered the Cubs since 1987, and for MLB.com since 2001.
