(David Cannon/Getty Images) \nSave a couple of stops on the West Coast Swing (Torrey Pines South and Riviera), the value of par really doesn’t resonate until the PGA TOUR embarks on its annual Florida Swing, which begins in earnest at this week’s Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens. \nAveraging 1.768 strokes over par last year, PGA National’s Champion Course was the hardest par 70 of all non-majors for the second straight season. Of the 10 times that the tournament has been contested here, Adam Scott’s 9-under 271 marked the eighth time that the winning pace was single digits under par. \nPOWER RANKINGS: The Honda Classic \nRANK Adam Scott \nThe defending champ is par or better in his last eight rounds at PGA National. He’s also connected six straight top 15s since October. Leads TOUR in strokes gained: putting. \nThe defending champ is par or better in his last eight rounds at PGA National.

Can pile on now at PGA National where he finished T10 last year. \nLook for Thomas Pieters, Danny Willett, Martin Kaymer, Paul Casey, Brooks Koepka and other notables in Tuesday’s Fantasy Insider. \nThe Champion Course tips at just 7,140 yards, but it has a dozen water hazards with undulating, TifEagle Bermudagrass greens that average just 5,500 square feet and prepped to run as fast as 12 feet on the Stimpmeter. Toss in rough of two-and-a-half inches and ubiquitous winds, and you immediately understand why par is a good score. \nLast year’s field averaged just 10.79 greens in regulation per round, 12th-lowest of the season. It converted those opportunities for eagle and birdies only one-quarter of the time (eighth-lowest clip of 2015-16). And when the field of 144 was scrambling to save par, it did just so just over half of the time, making PGA National the fifth-stingiest. \nIt wouldn’t be a preview without a peek at holes 15, 16 and 17, otherwise known as The Bear Trap. With respective pars of 3, 4 and 3, it averaged 0.478 strokes over par as a group last year. Scott scored 5-over on the set for the week, ultimately surviving a quadruple bogey-7 on 15 in his third round in which he still signed for a 4-under 66. \nWind and rain will headline the weather early and late this week, but neither can be ruled out as a threat at any time. Daytime temperatures will climb into the mid-80s, so it’ll feel a little sticky out there.
