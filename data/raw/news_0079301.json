(ABC Central West: Melanie Pearce) Leaving the days of Space Food Sticks behind \nEducation Minister Rob Stokes said he remembered buying Devon and sauce sandwiches, Space Food Sticks and bags of mixed lollies when he was at school. \nBut Mr Stokes said the new system struck the right balance between nutrition and freedom of choice. \n\"Obviously this is not about restricting choices for parents and students but it's about ensuring those choices are as healthy as possible,\" Mr Stokes said. \nHe said the new system was \"simpler and easier to understand\" than the old traffic light system but it would take some time to implement. \n\"We need to be very careful to recognise that school canteens are an important source of revenue for our schools as well so we want to work with schools to ensure that healthy eating becomes an every day fact of life,\" Mr Stokes said. \nReducing childhood obesity has been on a list of Premier's priorities for a number of years in NSW.
