Suhani Singh | Posted by Devarsi Ghosh A + A - \nIn the recent episode of Koffee With Karan, Kangana Ranaut spoke about Karan Johar referring to her as a \"great actress\" with a \"magnificent absence\". \nKoffee with Karan is known for its rapid fire round where one of the questions posed to celebrity guests has been to rank the five female actors. Three-time National Award-winner Kangana Ranaut's name never featured in the list with preference given to Katrina Kaif . \nWhen asked if it bothers her that some of her industry peers still don't recognise her even after delivering a Rs 150-plus-crore hit in Tanu Weds Manu Returns, Ranaut, who has been busy promoting Rangoon, said, \"No, I don't seek it from people like Karan Johar for sure. There are people I look up to and who can make a difference by simply acknowledging and appreciating you work.\" \nOne of them, Kangana said, is of course, Rangoon filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj; the others being Ritesh Batra whose film Ranaut has been rumoured to star in and Ketan Mehta, whose Rani Laxmibai is Ranaut's next project. \nBut Ranaut wasn't done with Johar. In his book An Unsuitable Boy, Karan Johar referred to Ranaut as \"a great actress\" who has \"made a branding out of her absence...People have a magnificent presence; she has a magnificent absence.\" \nRanaut hasn't read the book but her friends did make her aware of the remark. \"I don't get it,\" she said. \"Is it a jibe or a compliment? Is the absence because I'm missing from his parties or on his gossip circle or skipping filmi parties and award shows. I don't feel I am absent.\" \nRanaut recalled how about the time she met Vishal Bhardwaj in Paris and expressed a desire to work with him and he surprised her by showing \"a very fierce picture\" of hers and calling it 'This is my Julia'. \n\"This is so fulfilling for any performer,\" she said. \"You seek validation from people you look up to. Not people that you don't care about. Vishal Sir has written a character in which I can see a genuine appreciation for me as an actor and a genuine regard for my art. It is not just talk where you are praising someone sitting there and then never want to work with them.\" \nRanaut, who made her debut with Gangster in 2006, has completed a decade in Bollywood. How does she see her journey so far? \n\"I do feel that I have been chosen for things that were extraordinary,\" she said. \"My complicated relationship with my parents and later falling prey to the most unbelievable traps that the industry has, going through a struggle of a lifetime, then leading this amazing movement of women empowerment through my film Queen. I have paid a heavy price for all of it. But I'm OK with it. My life will always be of extremes.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:38:35.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
