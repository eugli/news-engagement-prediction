Being the first resident DJ at the club means that he will always be the headline act, with the club expected to pull in thousands of party-goers. \nIt cements his status as one of Africa's greatest DJ exports \nSure, Black Coffee has performed at Coachella and at some of the biggest festivals in the world, but the mark of a true musician is their ability to stay relevant. With a residency in the centre of Ibiza, Black Coffee will not only stay relevant, but will also no doubt push his brand to new heights. All of that while opening Ibiza for other South African acts. We have failed to encourage greatness in black, says JR \nHe will no doubt be partying with some of the world's biggest celebs. \nIt's no secret that some of the world's most famous stars like to head to Ibiza for the summer. \nAnne Hathaway, Justin Bieber, Drake and Kim Kardashian are just some of the stars that frequent the party island. Ibiza is known for its club-hopping culture, which means that Black Coffee may soon be entertaining some really big stars. \nDon't forget that Black Coffee already counts the likes of Swiss Beats, P Diddy and Paris Hilton as fans of his work. \nWith all that, we can't help but bow to King Black Coffee!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:39:23.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
