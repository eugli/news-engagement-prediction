Those who cannot spend much time reading or want to see visually as to what happened, this news presentation is a welcoming move and I wish Gulf News all the very best in the years / decades to come. Sonia \nVery nice! Very well presented without resorting to big drama. Talat Rashid 13 November 2013 15:38 \nWonderful, I read Gulf news almost every day, now this new look is even better. I bet lots of people are flocking to this your website every day. Good luck and keep up the best tradition of bringing world to us..
