The Imps claimed a Premier League scalp with a 1-0 win over Burnley on Saturday, and now could face Arsenal in the last eight Share Comments By David Maddock 22:30, 19 FEB 2017 Sport The Imps are flying in the FA Cup still - and toast is to thank (Photo: Clive Brunskill) Arsenal FC They may have plotted one of the FA Cup’s greatest shocks, but for Danny Cowley and his brother Nicky, the next few days will not be about glory - but toast!\nThe Lincoln management pair pulled off an audacious coup at Burnley, using the team’s unique strengths to undermine the Premier League side on their home turf, to become the first non-league team of the modern era to reach the quarter finals.\nAnd the secret of their success is an obsessive commitment - which is Marmite fuelled, according to their experienced keeper Paul Farman.\n“The way they live and the way they look at football can’t be healthy. It can’t be healthy, I swear. All they do is eat toast and watch football,” he explained.\n“All they eat is marmite on toast! You can always smell toast when you walk past the office. They are sat there all the time watching videos of football.\nFarman loves marmite on his toast (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) Lincoln's team of heroes (Photo: Getty Images) Toast for the lads (Photo: Rex) Read More Lincoln hero Sean Raggett is an Arsenal fan who's NEVER seen them live “When they come to training in the mornings you look at their eyes and they look shattered. But as soon as it switches 10.30 and we are on for training they are like men possessed.\n“There is only one word for them and that is workaholics. They have turned us into that and gave us this winning feeling of you’re never too high or too low, you have to embrace everything about it.”\nDespite their sudden fame, it will be business as usual for the brothers today, as they pour over at least three videos of North Ferriby United, who they meet in the National League tomorrow night.\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in Lincoln fans celebrate FA Cup draw Share this video Watch Next The meticulous planning that went into not just beating Burnley, but at times out-performing them, will be applied equally to the team currently bottom of the National League, as manager Danny explained.\n“The next 24 hours will be watching football. We have a lot of invites including going up to the Blackburn v Manchester United game,” he explained.\n“But nothing is going to get in the way of watching North Ferriby. Nicky and I owe it to the boys. Being promoted into the Football League can change our lives so we owe it to them to put the same amount of focus into them as we did against Burnley.\n“Three 90 minutes matches of their most recent games. That is the detail. We like to watch them together and banter off each other.\n“Our training plays a big part in our success so we can’t just part-train we are going to have to be clever with how we do it.”\npoll loading Will Lincoln City make the SEMI-FINALS of the FA Cup? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Arsenal FC Newsletter Follow @mirrorfootball Subscribe to our Arsenal FC Paul Farman Lincoln City Football Club Premier League Football League Ltd.
