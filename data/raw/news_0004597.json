(Supplied: BOM) \nMr Anand said it had cooled down slightly in the region today, with Applethorpe reaching 25C by 11:00am. \n\"It's cooler today in those areas compared to yesterday, but we do expect it to warm up again into the weekend and next week,\" he said. \nToday's highest temperatures so far have been in the Channel Country in the state's south-west. \nBy 11:30am, it had hit 41.3C in Birdsville and 40.4C in Windorah. \nBirdsville could surpass its hottest February day — currently 45.8C — today or tomorrow. \nMore temperature records could be broken next week unless a high pressure system over the Tasman Sea arrives to cool things down. \nThe hot weather is the continuation of a low pressure surface trough over southern Queensland that contributed to higher than average temperatures in January. \nOvernight minimums in January were the highest on record for a large area of southern Queensland, while maximum temperatures were in the highest 10 per cent of historical records for nearly all of the state's southern half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:07:12.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
