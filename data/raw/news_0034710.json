Flynn, the national security adviser, during a news conference on Monday. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Washington — Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, faced an uncertain future on Monday as the White House sent out a series of conflicting signals about whether he had the confidence of President Trump and whether he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of a call between Mr. Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the United States. “The president is evaluating the situation,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. “He’s speaking to Vice President Pence relative to the conversation the vice president had with General Flynn and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is: our national security.” The statement from Mr. Spicer came shortly after the president’s counselor, Kellyanne Conway, said in a televised interview on MSNBC that Mr. Flynn had the “full confidence of the president.” Video Trump’s Controversial Security Appointee Gen.

Watch in Times Video » embed The White House has examined a transcript of a wiretapped conversation that Mr. Flynn had with Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, in December. The call in included a discussion about sanctions against Russia and other issues. But Mr. Flynn is believed to have told Mr. Pence that sanctions and other policy was not discussed. Mr. Pence later said on television that Mr. Flynn’s call with the Russian ambassador was an informal chat. \n  Even the mere discussion of policy — and the apparent attempt to assuage the concerns of an American adversary — represents a remarkable breach of protocol, and is only the latest in Mr. Flynn’s growing list of questionable engagements with Russian officials, including his appearance at a party in Moscow sitting next to President Vladimir V. Putin in December 2015. Current and former senior officials said that the F.B.I. has been looking into the phone call. A former administration official said that the transcript is ambiguous enough to give the White House justification, should Mr. Trump want to retain Mr. Flynn. Got a confidential news tip?

Learn More Classified information does not appear to have been discussed, the official said. But current Trump administration officials and former Obama administration officials said that Mr. Flynn did appear to be reassuring an adversary that if any sanctions were imposed, it was a decision being made by the Obama administration, and that American policy could change in the Trump administration. The overall message, the former official said, was that the Obama administration was Moscow’s adversary, not the United States. The former official said Mr. Flynn urged that Russia not retaliate against any sanctions because an overreaction would make any future cooperation more complicated. Mr. Flynn never explicitly promised sanctions relief, the former official said, but he appeared to leave the impression that it would be possible.
