And the U.S. is not prepared, says Mark Cuban, the billionaire software developer and owner of the Dallas Mavericks. In a recent interview on Bloomberg TV , Cuban warned that even people with in-demand skills like computer coding could soon be displaced. “That might have been a great job a few years ago, but you might be out of work in five years,” he said, citing what he called “the automation of automation,” where computers learn how to write software better than humans can. “We’re going to have a lot of displaced workers — the nature of work is changing,” he said. So a new skill will become more in-demand than it ever has been: creative thinking . “I personally think there’s going to be a greater demand in 10 years for liberal arts majors than there were for programming majors and maybe even engineering,” he said. “When the data is all being spit out for you for you, options are being spit out for you, you need a different perspective in order to have a different view of the data.” In particular, experts in philosophy or foreign languages will ultimately command the most interest from employers in the next decade, Cuban said. Cuban went on to say that America should be investing in programs like Americorps, which leverages community-building and creative thinking to create social impact. But that type work isn’t always seen as valuable, Cuban said. “Making it a real job…that’s what we’re going to need,” he said.
