[but] what they share is immediacy and intense emotion.\" \n\"These are incredible,\" Slate's Amanda Katz tweeted in response to a series of Wilson works tweeted by her colleague Rebecca Onion. \nThe exhibition, which includes Wilson works not publicly exhibited since the 1920s, is at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts through April 9 before moving to New York and Nashville . \nWilson was one of the few American artists who saw combat in the war. He was one of even fewer who was on the battlefield as a soldier, serving as a second lieutenant in the Marines and winning a citation for bravery under fire. \nArt historian David Lubin, who is one of the curators and the author of \" Grand Illusions: American Art and World War \" (and this reporter's father), says Wilson's artistic contributions were unmatched in America. He writes: \"World War I did not produce an American artist of [German painter Otto] Dix's brilliance and depth, but Claggett Wilson was the closest equivalent.\" \nAlthough critically acclaimed, Wilson's works didn't sell well initially and were left to languish for decades in storage. As one 1935 article declared, \"Like the bursting of a shell, an arresting brilliance, then silence, is the fate of these paintings which were once considered America's most ambitious contribution in art to the memory of the Great War.\" \nWith permission from PAFA, we're running a set of works by Wilson below. View As: One Page Slides Wilson's dreamlike painting of Marines at Bois de Belleau shows the beginning of one of the deadliest battles in the history of the Corps. \"First Attack on the Bois de Belleau, June 6, 1918, at Five O’Clock—3rd Battalion, 5th Regiment of Marines Advancing\" (1919) by Claggett Wilson Smithsonian American Art Museum Wilson himself was gassed during the battle and found himself stranded in no man's land for three days. Here's his painting of another shell-shocked soldier. \"Runner Through the Barrage, Bois de Belleau, Château-Thierry Sector; His Arm Shot Away, His Mind Gone\" (1919) by Claggett Wilson Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC Another work from Bois de Belleau shows wounded French troops retreating. \"Stragglers—French Wounded in the Retreat of Château-Thierry\" (1919) by Claggett Wilson Smithsonian American Art Museum Wilson's works are hard to categorize. This painting of an explosion resembles abstract expressionism, but it's grounded in reality by the poor figures in the corner. \"Flower of Death—The Bursting of a Heavy Shell— Not as It Looks, but as It Feels and Sounds and Smells\" (1919) by Claggett Wilson Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC Wilson often painted exaggerated facial expressions, drawing inspiration from traditional Japanese art and theater—as in this painting of a German grenadier shocked as a concussive force shatters the tree in front of him. \"Grenadier Cut Off in the Flaming Woods\" (1919) by Claggett Wilson Smithsonian American Art Museum Critics have pointed to works like \"Front Line Stuff\" as \"pure cinema.\" \"Front Line Stuff\" (1919) by Claggett Wilson Smithsonian American Art Museum Other works were theatrical, like an \"Encounter in the Darkness\" framed by the ruins of a farmhouse. \"Encounter in the Darkness\" (1919) by Claggett Wilson Smithsonian American Art Museum Some works showed the bleak absurdity of war, like the \"Dance of Death\" of German soldiers caught in barbed wire. \"Dance of Death\" (1919) by Claggett Wilson Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC/Art Resource, NY \nSource: \" Grand Illusions \" Wilson was in his early 30s when he joined the Marines. Before that, he had studied with modernists in New York and Paris and taught at Columbia University's progressive Teachers College. \"Rosalie, Rosalie! Rosalie is the Nickname for the French Bayonet\" (1919) by Claggett Wilson Smithsonian American Art Museum \nSource: \" Grand Illusions \" Wilson's battlefield works, notes the catalogue, are \"harrowing and sometimes hallucinatory watercolors that call attention to the loneliness and despair of soldiers on the front lines ... [that] depicted his former adversaries, German foot soldiers, as fellow victims of the collective insanity of war.\" \"Symphony of Terror\" (1919) by Claggett Wilson Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC/Art Resource, NY ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:00:09.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
