As Statista's Dyfed Loeche reports, in total there are an estimated 11.1 million unauthorized migrants in the U.S. of which some 6.75 million took refuge in the big metropolitan areas, according to data collected by the Pew Research Center . Some of these metro areas have so-called sanctuary cities at their center. \nYou will find more statistics at Statista \nUnder Trump’s order, mayors defending their sanctuary city status are essentially imposing a defiance tax on local residents. On average, this tax amounts to $500 per man, woman and child. Major cities like Washington, D.C., New York and Chicago have the most to lose, and nearly $27 billion is at stake across the country. \nThe threat of losing nearly $27 billion in federal funding seems to be having an effect on some cities. In fact, Miami already reversed their sanctuary city policy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:15:15.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
