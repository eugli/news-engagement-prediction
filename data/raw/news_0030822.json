Generators are similar to mutants — people who are genuine oxygen thieves,\" the post read. \nMs Robinson said she was often called a \"generator\" during Ms McCarthy's critical visits to the store. \nIn another post after working with Ms Robinson in November 2012, the manager allegedly posted: \n\"What a day! It is difficult to soar with the eagles when you are surrounded by turkeys. Is it too late to pursue a different career?\" the post said. \nMs Robinson left the company in December 2012 on stress leave and has not been back. Company 'vehemently denies' Ms Robinson's claims \nHowever in an unusual move, the multi-million-dollar company read a statement to the media a day-and-a-half into the proceedings. \nThe company's head of people and culture, Emily Bourke, addressed the media at lunchtime today saying: \n\"As an employer of more than 2,000 people we take the claims being taken against the company very seriously,\" she said. \n\"We have conducted a through internal investigation and vehemently deny Ms Robinson's claims. \n\"We have workplace policies and procedures in place that very clearly state the company's position on workplace bullying and harassment and it was not tolerated in any circumstances. \n\"This is the first time in the company's 27-year history that we have been involved in proceedings of this nature. \n\"We will allow the legal process to run its course and we look forward to all evidence being presented to the court.\" \nMs Rourke would not take questions outside court after the statement.
