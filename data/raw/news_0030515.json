That action prevented the federal government from barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations and suspending, then limiting, the nation’s refugee program. \nTrump himself had threatened to pursue the case through the Supreme Court, but Monday’s motion indicates the White House will hold off on that approach — for now. \nThe motion confirms one of the multiple scenarios that Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to Trump, said the White House was considering to keep the measure alive. \nPresident Trump calls most recent court setback 'disgraceful' \nThose options, Miller said Sunday, included seeking an emergency stay at the Supreme Court, continuing the appeal with the panel, requesting an emergency hearing before the full circuit and “going to the trial court at the district level and trial on the merit.” \nThey also included “the possibility of new executive actions designed to prevent terrorist infiltration of our country,” Miller said during a blitz of appearances on political talk shows Sunday morning. Protesters rally in NYC against Trump's travel ban \nMiller reiterated the administration’s belief that Trump can do whatever he wants — simply because he is the President. \n“We have a judiciary that has taken far too much power and become in many cases a supreme branch of government,” Miller said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” \nWhite House looking at all options to keep Trump travel ban alive \n“Our opponents, the media, and the whole world will soon see, as we begin to take further actions, that the power of the President to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.” \n“The President’s powers here are beyond question,” he added — directly contradicting the San Francisco court’s ruling. \nThe California panel of three judges, reviewing a decision by a federal judge in Seattle that blocked parts of the order, noted in its ruling that the states raised serious allegations about religious discrimination and, in plain language, rejected the Trump administration’s argument that his executive orders are “unreviewable.” President Trump had suggested several possible responses to the federal appeals court ruling upholding an injunction on his travel and refugee ban. The White House on Monday began its first formal response.
