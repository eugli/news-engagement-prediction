PUBLISHED: 12:11, Thu, Feb 9, 2017 | UPDATED: 13:06, Thu, Feb 9, 2017 \nThe cleverest Scottish children are a year’s worth of schooling behind at science compared to before the SNP took power, think tank the Sutton Trust found. \nBoth Ruth Davidson and Kezia Dugdale attacked the SNP during FMQs on Thursday, as they accused Ms Sturgeon of failing to uphold and improve Scottish educational standards. \nMs Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said: “It is a generation of Scottish children who are being left behind in the race for qualifications and future jobs. \n“Scotland used to lead the world in education. Why under the SNP are we always playing catch up?” \nIn response, Ms Sturgeon said her political rival had done a disservice to pupils and teachers across Scotland. \n“I do not and never will shy away from the challenges we must address,” she said. SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT Nicola Sturgeon was accused of failing a generation of Scottish children \n“In our education system today we have record high exam passes and record numbers of young people going into positive destinations after they leave school.” \nNicola Sturgeon said it was important to note that the Sutton Trust's report was based on data that pre-dates its latest measures to close the attainment gap. \n\"It is an important report. It is one that aides our understanding of the challenges we need to address in order to tackle the attainment gap,\" she said. \n\"I think it is important to note, though, that the Sutton Trust does not present new data. \n\"It is analysis of the Pisa scores that were published in December. Of course, the Pisa scores are based on a survey that was carried out two years ago. SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT TV Kezia Dugdale also cited the Sutton Trust report It is a generation of Scottish children who are being left behind in the race for qualifications and future jobs Ruth Davidson \n\"A survey that pre-dates the Attainment Challenge and pre-dates the reforms to our education system that are under way.\" \nMs Dugdale, the Labour leader at Holyrood, said the report had exposed the SNP’s “catastrophic failures” on education. \nShe said the subjects most critical to growing Scotland’s economy were the ones the SNP was failing the most. \n“The SNP are leaving the poorest children behind,” she added.
