Indeed, in the 2000s, under former CEO Steve Ballmer, Microsoft became better known for its efforts to preserve its control of the PC industry than for innovation . \nNow, Nadella is a big believer in making Microsoft more driven by a sense of purpose — in 2015, he declared that Microsoft's mission is \" to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.\" And he's encouraged the company not to rest on its laurels . \nUnder Nadella, Microsoft has taken the focus off Windows and the PC and pinned its hopes to the rise of the Microsoft Azure and Office 365 cloud computing products, both of which are growing as its older businesses stagnate . While this approach hasn't translated into huge revenue growth yet, it's revitalized the company's image. \nFor his part, Gates tells USA Today that he \"[enjoys] working with\" Nadella, serving his twice-removed successor as a special advisor, and helping guide the company's investments into cutting-edge technology as it competes with Apple, Google, and Amazon.
