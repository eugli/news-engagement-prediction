You were baking if you were in central Virginia, where the temperature jumped into the upper 70s, while residents north of the Potomac were stuck in the 40s-50s all day. But it’s the wind that will become the main hazard over the next 24 hours as a high wind warning will go into effect for much of the region later tonight. \nThrough Tonight: Some scattered showers will move through late this afternoon into the early evening, with most of the precipitation focused to the south of D.C. An isolated rumble of thunder with one or two of these storms cannot be ruled out. Strong northwest flow picks up around 7 p.m. (earlier in elevated spots to the west), dropping temperatures into the mid- to upper 30s tonight. Northwest winds at 15-20+ mph through midnight, when winds will ramp up to a sustained 20-30 mph. Winds will gust to 40-50+ mph during this time frame. Minor damage and scattered power outages are likely. \n\nView the current weather conditions at The Washington Post. \nTomorrow (Monday): Monday morning is likely to feature the strongest winds for the D.C. metro area, creating some hazardous driving conditions for the morning commute. From approximately 6 a.m. to noon, much of the region will be under sustained northwest winds at 20-30 mph, with gusts approaching 50 mph. Winds should begin to calm somewhat in the afternoon, though still expecting gusty conditions of 25+ mph through 5/6 p.m. Mostly sunny and cold. High temperatures in the low to mid-40s, with wind chill in the 20s. Partly cloudy tomorrow night with much calmer conditions. Lows in the upper 20s, with winds at 5-15 mph. Pink skies at night.
