IU has now lost five games in a row, and seven of its last eight. \n“This is our 12th game where it’s three points or less under a minute to go,” IU coach Tom Crean said. “It’s disheartening that we play as hard as we play — we make our mistakes, as do the other teams — to not have it go our way. They’re working their tail off.” \nPeter Jok, the Big Ten’s leading scorer, led all players with 35 points, while Robert Johnson scored a team-high 19 points before fouling out. \n• BOX SCORE: Iowa 96, Indiana 90, OT \nIndiana (15-13, 5-10) couldn’t have asked for a better start. Seven Josh Newkirk points, coupled with some ugly Iowa offense, let the Hoosiers build a quick 12-2 run. \nHawkeyes (15-13, 7-8) coach Fran McCaffrey responded by benching his starting five, and by the second media timeout of the half, he’d already used 12 players. A pair of 3s steadied Iowa, and a zone slowed IU down, but couldn’t trim the deficit immediately. \nIU actually led 17-4 early, shots falling and Iowa reeling. It was the kind of stretch we haven’t seen out of Indiana in weeks now, the Hoosiers using aggressive offense to feed sharp defense and dictate the terms of the game to an opponent. \nFor a moment, Indiana looked like running away. For a moment, Indiana looked something like what we once believed Indiana could be. \nThe moment did not last. \nIowa dug its heels in, and waited for IU’s old weaknesses to infect its performance. They did, to the tune of 22 turnovers, 35 fouls, 34 Iowa points in the paint. \nNot a year ago, these two teams were fighting for a league title. On Tuesday night, they were fighting to avoid a Wednesday appearance in the Big Ten tournament, and possibly for NIT positioning. \nSuddenly, any postseason at all is looking questionable at best for Indiana, given Fred Glass’ declaration in 2014 that “we’re Indiana. We don’t play in the (College Basketball Invitational).” \nGlass was behind the bench Tuesday, courtside for a game that carried more Big Ten tournament implications than NCAA tournament implications. \nBut Indiana didn’t just start brightly. The Hoosiers actually led for nearly all of the game, beating back one Iowa run after another. \nFollowing that initial burst, Indiana still kept the Hawkeyes at arm’s length for much of regulation. The game fell into a repetitive pattern, the Hawkeyes surging, IU answering, the Hawkeyes falling back, regrouping and surging again. \nFive of the game’s nine ties came after Iowa took its first lead, with just 2:10 remaining in the second half. \nBut fouls began to mount. IU would eventually finish with four starters disqualified because of them, and Jok shot and made more free throws (22-of-23, an Iowa record) than Indiana managed as a team (16-of-19). Crean said postgame that he didn’t realize the free-throw disparity until after the game, and declined to comment on it. \n“I had no idea until I got back in here and saw the stat sheet,” he said. \nThe free throws weren’t all that kept Iowa close, then pushed Iowa ahead, then won Iowa the game. Turnovers too often killed Indiana’s momentum, or created Iowa’s. \nAnother familiar refrain. \n“It’s times we just get away from the fundamental base, and post feeding, or driving the baseline, when the post is loaded. It’s not how we practice,” Crean said, trying to diagnose IU’s 22 giveaways. “But again, what I’ve got to look back at is, at the end of the day, we’re right there to win the game. It goes to overtime. We don’t win it, with the mistakes that were made. But then you look at the stat sheet, and I don’t know how we were in the game. But we were.” \nCrean’s right. A listless performance against Michigan aside, IU has been within touching distance in the other four losses that round out the Hoosiers’ current streak. \nThey almost give this five-game skid even more weight, Indiana repeatedly coming so close, and repeatedly authoring its own undoing. \n“I think Tom's done a great job keeping them together, keeping them fighting,” McCaffrey said. “It's got to be difficult.” \nIt wasn’t the first time McCaffrey defended his counterpart this week. \nIowa’s coach reportedly fielded a call on his weekly radio show Monday raising the question of Crean’s job security in Bloomington. McCaffrey shot the question down emphatically, but the moment spoke for itself — IU’s season of seemingly limitless frustration has spread across the conference. \nThere were Kansas and North Carolina, and the heady moments when we thought these Hoosiers could play into April. What’s transpired since is the product of an almost perfect storm of injuries and uncorrected flaws, the same story repeating itself over and over in arenas across the Midwest. \nMcCaffrey, who starts multiple freshmen and is dealing with team-wide flaws of his own, can relate. And Iowa met Indiana on a three-game losing streak of its own. \nSo McCaffrey spoke with understandable pride postgame, about his team's resolve. \n“There were a number of times where we could’ve packed it in, and we didn’t,” McCaffrey said. “That says a lot about our guys.” \nIt said a lot Tuesday night, and not just about his guys. \nFollow IndyStar reporter Zach Osterman on Twitter: @ZachOsterman.
