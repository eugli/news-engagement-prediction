(Harry How/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  50 PM \nAny far-fetched hopes the Knicks might’ve had about landing free-agent-to-be Chris Paul probably followed Charles Oakley out the door Wednesday night. \nPaul was appalled with the way the Knicks handled things with Oakley at the Garden, specifically the team’s statement about the incident and the line “we hope he gets some help soon.” \n“Hope he gets some help soon? Not the right way to portray Oak,” Paul tweeted Thursday afternoon. “... always had my back and the realest person our league has seen #UncleOak” Hope that he gets some help soon? Not the right way to portray Oak...always had my back and the realest person our league has seen #UncleOak — Chris Paul (@CP3) February 9, 2017 \nPaul joins his friend LeBron James in publicly supporting Oakley following the ugly scene; James shared a photo of Oakley on Instagram, calling the retired All-Star forward a legend. While the Clippers were in town, Paul was not with them; he’s rehabbing from torn ligament in his left thumb. \nOakley was arrested and charged with three counts of misdemeanor assault after he got into it with security guards, shoving one of them. The 53-year-old was seated behind Garden chairman James Dolan — Oakley first said he bought the ticket only to later say that it was given to him — and things quickly escalated from there. When Oakley was asked to leave, he objected and the situation spiraled. Charles Oakley is removed from Madison Square Garden by arena security Wednesday night. (Frank Franklin II/AP) \nWhile the Knicks have been celebrating their 70th anniversary, and inviting many former players back to the Garden, Oakley has been excluded. The Daily News’ Frank Isola reported that Oakley has been hurt by the Knicks ignoring his place in the team’s history. \nOakley insisted that he didn’t say anything to Dolan, who was in his normal courtside seat, Wednesday night.
