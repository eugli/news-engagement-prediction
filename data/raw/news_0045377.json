Diastasis Recti: What is it and why you need to know about it if you're pregnant \nUlcerative colitis (UC) is, is a form of chronic bowel disease that affects (and inflames) your rectum and colon. \nThe disease produces ulcers in said areas, resulting in bloody, loose stools and painful diarrhoea, stomach cramps, weight and appetite loss. And if left untreated, it can be life-threatening. \nSo that’s the pleasantries out of the way. (Picture: Getty) \nI’ve no shame or embarrassment in saying I have UC and have had it for around 11 years, since the age of 21. \nIt’s not a pleasant thing to have throughout your 20s but one key thing about living with UC is accepting you have it and to not feel coy about discussing it. \nAfter all, everyone excretes – it’s as natural as breathing – so why the sheepish attitude to talking about bowel disease and poop? \nBut coping with UC is not simply about managing the disease, it can severely affect your mental health too. \nFor example, anxiety and depression are heavily associate with having the illness. \nHere are seven ways that UC can affect you, and how you can effectively deal with them. You’re overwhelmed by the diagnosis (Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for Metro.co.uk) \nIt’s very easy to come out of hospital after a diagnosis, with all sorts of meds and lifestyle changes to consider, but there’s nothing in place to address the thoughts running through your head. \nIt’s a massive bombshell to be told that you’ve an incurable disease, which you need to take pills for, for the rest of your life. \nThere’s very little mental health assistance during this time of your life. Or at least there wasn’t when I was diagnosed back in 2006. \nIn fact, not a word was uttered in terms of discussing inner feelings with a counsellor or professional, which left my anxieties and personal thoughts to fester. \nGet in touch with Crohns & Colitis UK – they’ll provide some good support and tips on coping with the disease. ‘Why me?’ (Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for Metro.co.uk) \nIt’s too easy to fall into a depressive mindset with UC, especially if your health has been poor for a lengthy period of time. \n‘Why me’ or ‘or ‘I’m never gonna be normal and healthy again’ are phrases you’ll notice floating around your thoughts. \nThe way I see it is, there’s zero point dwelling on or getting upset over how you’ve been singled out. \nYou haven’t been – UC is more common than you’d imagine. It’s also not a world away from IBS, which loads of people have. \nI often come across people who tell me their uncle, or parent, or sister has UC so don’t convince yourself it’s only you suffering. \nYes, you will be OK. You’re having a bad spell, you’re on medication but time and medication will aid your recovery. You’re worried about other diseases (Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for Metro.co.uk) \nWhile it’s true that having UC can increase the risk of getting a number of things including anaemia and bowel cancer, you need to remind yourself not to spend your days worrying about what might happen. \nThe reality is, if someone – anyone, for that matter – gets cancer there’s nothing the person could’ve done to prevent it. \nSimilarly, there’s no point worrying about things like going out shopping in case you’re hit by a bus. \nMy point is, with UC, you cannot spend your life worrying about scenarios that may never even happen. \nRemember: flare ups are exacerbated by stress and worry, so do everything in your power to lead a stress-free, well-paced life. \nAnd that does include both your job and personal life. You’re worrying about how you look (Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for Metro.co.uk) \nRunning to the loo, dehydration, a lack of appetite, and general apathy can take its toll on your body – both on the inside and outside. \nWhen I emerged from hospital after my diagnosis, I’d lost over two stone and wasn’t in the best shape. \nTry not to panic about weight and feeling physically good about yourself. \nThe more you begin to eat – and assuming it’s the right kind of healthy and diet-appropriate foods – the sooner you’ll notice that weight go back on. \nCombining it with exercise and gym work, you’ll be feeling good about yourself within months. You worry about going out (Picture: Getty) \nUC sufferers can be serial worriers, especially when having off days or suffering from a flare up. \nUnlike people with regular bowel function, when we gotta go we gotta go – sometimes within seconds – so going out can prove stressful when you’re not 100%. \nMake sure you know where the loos are and plan your journeys to cover yourself. \nIf you know there’s a loo nearby then that halves the anxiety in itself. You’re embarrassed about going to the toilet so much (Picture: Getty) \nYou’re having a bad week and you’ve dashed to the toilet half a dozen times and it’s not even mid-afternoon. \nDon’t worry.
