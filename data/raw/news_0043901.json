The late British sculptor Henry Moore inspired every aspect of this collection , from structured designs to a contoured beauty look and the set in Makers House. Burberry partnered with the Henry Moore Foundation for this show, celebrating the organizationâ€™s 40th anniversary and Mooreâ€™s work.\nA long list of house favorites and celebrities gathered at the Soho venue Makers House, including Naomi Campbell, Penelope Cruz, Suki Waterhouse, Donald Glover, Adwoa Aboah, and Freida Pinto. A huge crowd of girls gathered outside for Kris Wuâ€™s arrival.\nSuki Waterhouse, Naomi Campbell, and Penelope Cruz. Photo: David M.

She covered a song by Christine and the Queens as the first models walked â€” singer HÃ©loÃ¯se Letissier, who performs as Christine and the Queens, sat front row and smiled at the song choice.\nSeventy-nine looks walked past Mooreâ€™s sculptures lining the runway, with the artistâ€™s works informing the collectionâ€™s shapes and neutral palette â€” in white, ivory, navy, and gray fabrics. An ivory jacket and black boots opened the show, followed by ruffled white shirts and blue shirt dresses, cutout beige knit sweaters, and one-shouldered dresses with trench coats.\nPhoto: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images Like last season, there were unisex designs â€” both male and female models wore shirts embellished with frills and lace. A dress and a few menâ€™s shirts were printed with images of Mooreâ€™s sculptures.\n@burberry #burberry #londonfashionweek #womenswear #london #fw17 #rtw #aw17 #fashion #lfw #bfc #catwalk #fashionstyle #fashionaddict #fashionlover #runway #fashionblogger #fashiondaily #blue #beautiful #fashionicon #navy #prints #fashionist #style #outfit #stylish #ootd See more at www.firstVIEW.com \nA post shared by firstVIEW (@firstviewphoto) on Feb 20, 2017 at 12:14pm PST \nRuffled shirts and knit jackets were worn over striped shirts with loose pants.\n@burberry #burberry #londonfashionweek #womenswear #london #fw17 #rtw #aw17 #fashion #lfw #bfc #catwalk #fashionstyle #fashionaddict #fashionlover #runway #fashionblogger #navy #fashionoftheday #beautiful #fashionicon #stripes #blue #white #style #outfit #stylish #ootd See more at www.firstVIEW.com \nA post shared by firstVIEW (@firstviewphoto) on Feb 20, 2017 at 12:18pm PST \nModels wore simple black boots and carried cylindrical bags or structured rectangular purses in navy, dark green, orange, and black leather.\n@burberry #burberry #bags #londonfashionweek #womenswear #london #fw17 #rtw #aw17 #fashion #lfw #bfc #catwalk #fashionstyle #fashionaddict #fashionlover #runway #fashionblogger #fashiondaily #fashionoftheday #beautiful #fashionicon #fashioninspiration #fashiontrend #fashionist #style #outfit #stylish #accessories See more at www.firstVIEW.com \nA post shared by firstVIEW (@firstviewphoto) on Feb 20, 2017 at 12:10pm PST \nThe finale was easily the best part, and a surprise: Models reappeared with ornate collars and headpieces pieces added to their looks, referencing Victoriana.
