Koreans praise missile test despite sanctions 03:00 Strained relations In their first meeting, new US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday stressed to Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, the growing threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. Tillerson urged China to \"use all available tools to moderate North Korea's destabilizing behavior,\" said acting US State Department spokesman Mark Toner. 4 ways Donald Trump could deal with North Korea While pledging to strictly implement UN-imposed sanctions, Wang told reporters in Germany -- where both he and Tillerson were attending a G20 ministerial conference -- that there is still hope to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue through diplomacy, and Beijing is willing to facilitate multilateral talks, according to a statement released by the Chinese foreign ministry. In late January, several Chinese ministries jointly issued an extensive list of prohibited items for export to North Korea in compliance of Resolution 2321. That ban covered military-civilian dual-use articles related to weapons of mass destruction -- including not only chemicals and weapons technologies, but also design software, high-speed cameras and truck chassis. A foreign ministry official pointed to the list at the time as clear evidence to rebut skepticism over China's determination to implement UN sanctions against North Korea, its neighbor and longtime communist ally. Beijing remains Pyongyang's biggest trade partner, providing an economic and political lifeline to the increasingly isolated regime. China views North Korea as a strategic buffer between itself and South Korea, which has a sizable US military presence. It also fears a potential refugee crisis on its doorstep if the Pyongyang regime suddenly collapses.

The Chinese leadership is said to be growing frustrated with Kim's defiant stance on the nuclear issue and the resulting instability in Northeast Asia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T11:07:01.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
