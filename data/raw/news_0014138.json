That could be for a lot of reasons. \nThe Bulldogs signed elite players at quarterback and running back. They also grabbed a quartet of big receivers. But what has caught the eye of many in Bulldog Nation with the 2017 class is the offensive linemen. \nA group that averages over 6-foot-5 inches tall and over 330 pounds, Chaney believes it's a group that, from a physical standpoint, can help the team right away. (Photo: Andrew Ivins, 247Sports) \n\"I believe everyone we’ve been able to bring in on that offensive line is going to be able to do that,\" Chaney said. \"I don’t feel like there’s a young man that you can say, ‘Boy, he’s going to have to sit out a few years and gain that size and that strength,’ like in the old days when we used to do it. Most of these kids are walking in the door with the size and the speed that you’re looking for to be able to compete. Now, how quick can they pick up the playbook and how quick can they adjust to the speed of the SEC game? Who knows those questions? But they’re walking in and look right. I’m excited about watching that group of kids.” \nThe group includes a pair elite tackle prospects in Isaiah Wilson and Andrew Thomas . It also consists of two other four-star tackles, D'Marcus Hayes and D'Antne Demery who have the tools teams covet in a bookend. Then there's Cedar Grove teammates Netori Johnson and Justin Shaffer , who'll begin their Bulldog careers at guard. Not a member?

Since the Bulldogs offensive scheme relies on getting movement at the point of attack, Chaney believes that the influx of size and talent up front will help UGA do just that. \n“I believe strongly in physicality and the ability to win a football game in the trenches, to run the ball with a certain amount of physicality,\" Chaney said. \"If you look throughout this signing class, we’re able to sign some kids with some stature who will inevitably help with the physicality we’re trying to get to.\" \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
