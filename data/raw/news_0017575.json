It is absolutely wrong and unacceptable to throw the blame on one person. “Ramaphosa cannot deny the fact that he and Mthethwa were in contact in the days leading up to the massacre. \nWe are convinced that these discussions must indeed [have] had some bearing on the decision that was taken to employ live ammunition. “COPE believes that the truth can never be concealed‚ sooner or later the country will know the truth. We want to reiterate that Zuma and his government must not use Phiyega as a scapegoat. \n“Mthethwa and Ramaphosa must also be fired from their positions and be criminally charged for the massacre of the 34 mine workers at Marikana‚” Bloem stated.
