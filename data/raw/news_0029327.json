To kick off New York Fashion Week, a Boiler Room party hosted sets by Migos , 21 Savage , Lil Uzi Vert , and Abra. Luckily, the whole night was filmed and has now made its way to YouTube. \nWhile the first few sets went very smoothly, by the end of the night there was a huge gathering on stage, making it a little harder for the performers to do their thing. By the time Metro Boomin was on, stage crashers were being to asked to make their way back to the crowd in order for the show to proceed. The good news is, it seems like people were having a great time. \nBy the time Migos came on stage, they were having some mic trouble, but everything came together when they performed \"Bad and Boujee,\" which had the crowd going insane. Later on Lil Uzi Vert and Playboi Carti would perform their collaboration \"Of Course We Ghetto Flowers,\" while 21 Savage would do both \"X\" and \"No Heart.\" \nWatch the performance above.
