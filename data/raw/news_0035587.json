These models have the best car tech we've tested. Next \nBuying a new car ranks right up there with visits to the dentist and tax audits as most people's least favorite experiences. And it's gotten even more frustrating and complicated thanks to all the new technology coming to modern vehicles. \nIt doesn't help that the latest connected cars can vary widely in user-friendliness and available features. So it's essential that you know what to look before starting to shop for a new vehicle. And given that a new car is such a large purchase—and you'll likely be holding on to a vehicle for at least a few years—you have to live with that choice much longer compared with, say, deciding which new smartphone or tablet to buy. \nHere are some of the main technologies you want to keep in mind when shopping for a new car: Infotainment Interfaces \nInfotainment is one of the most difficult tech features to judge, since there are no industry standards. It's also an area where automakers (and car buyers) are struggling. Controlling audio playback, navigation, and in-car apps when behind the wheel is a lot different than tapping away on your iPhone when sitting comfortably in your living room. A couple of infotainment interfaces we find easy to use are Toyota Entune and Volvo Sensus Connect for the former's configurable interface and the latter's large display layout. Connectivity and Apps \nConnectivity is what lets you access navigation, real-time traffic updates, local search, and more while on the road. That's why automakers are aggressively adding connectivity and in-dash apps to vehicles in three varieties: embedded, tethered, and a hybrid approach. \nEmbedded means there's a modem in the vehicle (and a subscription is usually required) to connect to the cloud, as with Mercedes-Benz mbrace2 system. Tethered systems leverage the connectivity—and data plan—of your portable device by syncing to the car's infotainment system, as with Chevy MyLink . The hybrid approach uses a combination of the two: embedded connectivity for critical functions such as automatic crash notification, and tethered connectivity for, say, infotainment apps. \nWe prefer the tethered approach (and not paying a monthly subscription) that's best exemplified by systems that feature Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . Apple and Google's tethering ecosystems offer broad support across multiple infotainment platforms. \nFor a closer look at connectivity options, read Buying a New Car? Know Your Connectivity Options . Audio \nMusic was the original consumer electronics technology to enter the car. And today there's more ways than ever to get great road tunes in your ride: AM and FM (now in HD), satellite radio, CD and DVD, in-dash hard drives, portable device integration via USB and auxiliary inputs, SD cards, and streaming music apps. But no matter how many music sources you have in your car, they'll only be as enjoyable as the stereo system they're played through. The good news is that premium audio in cars is better than ever and range from the expensive and esoteric, as with the Bang & Olufsen systems in several luxury makes with tweeters that rise out of the dashboard, to the low- or no-cost options like the sweet-sounding Infinity systems in many Kia vehicles. Navigation \nKnowing how to get where you're going is vital when driving, which is why in-dash navigation systems have made paper maps almost obsolete. And nav systems have gotten better with cloud connectivity, allowing for real-time traffic info, local search, and compatibility with portable devices. Audi's MMI system is a good example of just how far navigation has come. It offers Google Earth mapping, parking information that lets you find available spots in advance, and even a \"picture navigation\" feature that uses the geotagged information from a digital photograph to find an address and route the car to it. Of course, if you aren't happy with your vehicle's built-in navigation, you can always turn to a free GPS app . Bluetooth \nBlueooth was originally just for hands-free phone usage, but has evolved into providing streaming music from a portable device. It also serves as the link between a car's infotainment system and designated apps on your smartphone. Compatibility issues that have plagued the connection between phones and cars can still be a problem, however. That's why it's important to make sure your devices and new car can communicate with one another. \nIn fact, when you're test-driving new vehicles, make sure to spend time trying out the tech features. Get to know the operation of the infotainment system, understand how the car connects to the cloud and which apps are available, listen to the audio system and check out its music sources, enter a destination into the navigation system, and pair your device with the car via Bluetooth and make a few phone calls. This way you lessen your chance of buying a car with poor technology that you'll be stuck with for years to come. Safety \nLast but not least is one of the first things you should consider when buying a new vehicle, and that's safety. Modern driver-assist systems use various combinations of cameras and sensors to keep track of dangers you may not notice, like the car ahead of you suddenly hitting the breaks, or another car approaching in your blind spot. Depending on the driver assists in your vehicle, you might receive an alert warning you of potential hazards, while some systems will automatically take over for you. And that's worth a heck of a lot more than a new sound system.
