Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nGiven that when we're on a plane we're (more than likely) heading off on an exciting holiday or adventure, you can forgive passengers for getting a little overexcited. \nOr, when you're on the way back from your dream holiday, being thoroughly miserable. \nBut spare a thought for the flight crew who have to put up with this all every day and night they are on shift. \nIn a Reddit thread , flight attendants were asked to reveal the things they really want passengers to stop doing. \nAnd they didn't hold back at all. Here are the things you should probably stop doing if you don't want to annoy your cabin crew on your next flight. 1. Keeping electronics on \nThis was a very popular discussion on the thread, with passengers saying they couldn't work out what the big deal is about turning electronics off. \nFlight attendants explained that it is their responsibility to ensure all passengers have electronics turned off before the plane can taxi to the runway - so you can imagine how annoying it is when they see those phone screens lighting up. \nSad_Pandaa said that it was the worst thing about the job, commenting: \"The most challenging thing is telling a plane full of adults to turn the electronics off multiple times. Just put your phone away for 20 minutes (Photo: Getty) \n\"We have to make sure all devices are off before we can taxi. Just do it so we can all get on our way. \n\"This applies to pretty much any announcement, if we're saying something it is most likely because it's required of us by FAA. We do appreciate it cooperation.\" \nAnother flight attendant commented: \"Whenever I see someone who doesn't turn off their electronics once the announcement is made, I just get filled with some sort of irrational rage. \n\"They all know the rules. They all know what is expected of them. Just f***ing do it!\" 2. Tripping them up/elbowing them \nThis is something all passengers are guilty of doing. Flights are so cramped, with such limited space in the seats, that part of you is destined to stray out of your imaginary seat boundary into the aisle - mainly feet and elbows, but occasionally the odd bag strap or jacket will do so also. \nSad_Pandaa commented: \"Be mindful of your feet, backpack straps, elbows in the aisle. I understand planes are incredibly tight and uncomfortable so I do my best to dodge these objects. \n\"The aisle is my very small workplace though and it's unpleasant to get elbowed in the bum, tripped by a leg, etc.\" There isn't much room on planes (Photo: Getty) \ntjean: I had my foot smashed into the armrest of the chair in front of me by a drink cart once, and let me tell you was it painful! I had fallen asleep with my one leg crossed over my other on an international flight, and I guess my foot was in the aisle and the attendant didn't see it at all and smashed it. I wasn't mad at all, because it was totally my own fault, but the super bitchy look she gave me definitely wasn't needed especially when I was apologetic. 3. Feeding kids sweets \nOne former flight attendant stressed the importance of not over-feeding children before they get on a flight, commenting: \"Please please please do not feed your kids a bunch of food and candy before you get on the plane. Sweets might not be the best for hyperactivity, either (Photo: Getty) \n\"Their little tummies are most sensitive to turbulence and the tend to throw up, a lot, without warning. But do bring them a a beverage with a lid and straw and maybe some gum because their little ears can't adjust as easy to the altitude and it puts them in pain.\" 4. Asking which drinks they have \nThere's a menu and shop list for a reason. When you see the flight attendants coming down the aisle with their drinks trolley, maybe start having a little peruse of the drinks items on the menu. \nCabin crew apparently don't like being asked which drinks they're stocking - to be fair, it would take a while if they had to list them off to every passenger. Just have coffee. (Photo: Getty) \nSuq_Madiq_Beech explained: \"Being asked what drinks you have gets old. If I had to list off every single beverage we had off to everyone who asked, everyday I would lose my voice. \n\"Just ask for something and if we don't have it we'll go from there!\" 5. Piling rubbish up on trays \nThink you're doing them a favour by putting all of your rubbish in a neat pile on your food tray? \nYou're not. \nReddit user yookskar explained: \"Don't pile up all your dinnerware and food stuff on the tray after a meal service. She won't be happy if you pass that back to her all piled up (Photo: Getty) \n\"They have to jam all the trays back into the tiny slots of the cart they came on, so it's so much easier if the height of debris on your tray doesn't exceed the height of the little plastic coffee mug.\" 6. Don't bring your carry-on when evacuating \nThis one's pretty self explanatory. Just leave your bags in the overhead lockers - your life is more important. 7. Leaving stuff on the plane \nMake sure you don't leave important or valuable items behind when you finally disembark. \nAs one flight attendant put it: \"Do a very through check for your things before you leave the plane. Do you have your coats and wallets and cell phones and laptops and sunglasses and luggage and children? Don't drop your passport (Photo: Getty) \n\"I've had every one of those left on my plane. If it was a wallet or electronic device I often held on to it and would make extra effort to get it to its rightful owner. \n\"I'd look for a name, phone number, email, address, etc and spend my own time and sometimes money for postage to get it back to you. \" 8. Ignoring them \nThis is one most passengers will have been guilty of doing at some point in their lives - ignoring the safety briefing. \nYes, you might have heard it many times before, but what if it's changed? It's only a few minutes of your life. Just listen before you put your headphones/earplugs in and start reading your book. \n\"Please pay attention to our safety briefing,\" one flight attendant said. \"Hopefully you will never ever have to actually use the information in the briefing, but what if you do? \n\"Pull out the safety manual, actually notice where your closest exits are, and find your back up exits as well.

You do know how to use the oxygen masks? \n\"Does the plane you are on even have oxygen masks? Hint, not all planes do. The truth is most flight attendants are not so much terrified of an emergency situation, they happen all the time and most often are not deadly crashes. \n\"What we are terrified of is the thought of a plane full of passengers that are panicking and have no clue what to do because they didn't pay attention during the safety briefing.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T19:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T14:39:53.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
