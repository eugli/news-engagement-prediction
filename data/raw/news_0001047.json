Half Dome and the Yosemite high country covered with snow. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Matt Hamilton . It’s unclear how many people were infected in total. \nSchool officials notified parents of students at John Adams Middle School on Sunday, and officials at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health have helped trace the outbreak to the Yosemite trip. \nAbout 190 7th-graders were on the trip, along with the teachers and parents. The group returned Friday from Yosemite but did not step onto campus until classes resumed Monday morning, district officials said. \nOfficials believe the same illness spread to other students at the school who were not on the Yosemite trip, as well as to siblings who attend other schools within the district. \n“The challenge with this highly contagious illness is that a child or adult may still feel well when they are contagious, making containment difficult,” according to the district’s letter. \nSchool officials said they were working with public health officials to prevent the spread of the illness. Classrooms and other facilities were being cleaned with special products recommended by public health officials. \nOn the trip, students rode by bus to Yosemite and slept in tents in Curry Village and dormitories in Crane Flat. The trip was billed as a way to stay “far away from any shiny screens and electronics,” according to the school’s website. \nNorovirus is a contagious organism that can be spread through contaminated food or water and human interaction, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . \nBetween 19 million and 21 million illnesses are caused by norovirus each year, and it is considered the most common cause of food-borne disease outbreaks in the U.S. \nThose infected typically experience inflammation of the stomach and intestines as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach pain.
