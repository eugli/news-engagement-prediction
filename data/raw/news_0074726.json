This picture is just the latest in a long line of mind-bending puzzles to sweep the web The makers of Highland Spring created the brainteaser to highlight how natural hydration can help us improve our productivity and concentration.

Once you've seen spotted the child in the foetal position then you won't be able to unsee it - and you'll wonder how you missed it before. The red outline shows a baby in the photograph that you now won't be able to unsee - but did you spot it to begin with? It seems that every optical illusion that crops up online claims to be trickier than the last.
