February 26, 2017 10:08am by Staff writers with AFP Source: FOX SPORTS ROBERT Lewandowski’s treble as Bayern Munich hit eight goals, Fabinho puts Monaco top of Ligue 1, and Real has a new joint leader at the top of La Liga. \nCatch up on all the overseas action in EuroBeat! \nBUNDELISGA: Lewandowski leads Bayern to new rout against Hamburg \nRobert Lewandowski netted a hat-trick as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich handed Hamburg an 8-0 thrashing at the Allianz Arena on Saturday in Carlo Ancelotti’s 1000th match as a coach. \nKingsley Coman came off the bench to score twice while Arturo Vidal, David Alaba and Arjen Robben were also on target as Bayern got back to winning ways after last weekend’s 1-1 draw at Hertha Berlin. \nThey stay five points clear of second-placed RB Leipzig, who were 3-1 winners at home to Cologne. Munich's Robert Lewandowski celebrates with Douglas Costa. Source: AP \nFor struggling Hamburg there was a depressing predictability about the outcome of their trip to Bavaria - they had conceded 36 goals in losing their previous six away league meetings with Bayern. \nThat run included two 5-0 defeats, a 6-0 loss, one 8-0 drubbing and a 9-2 humiliation in March 2013. \nAfter the match, Ancelotti was understandably pleased with his team’s performance. “Perfect day, perfect game. The team was fantastic and I’m delighted,” Ancelotti said. \nHe also praised out-of-form forward Muller, who was the provider for Bayern today despite finishing goalless. “Thomas was the key man for us today. The best player on the field. He was involved in every attack,” Ancelotti said. Munich's coach Carlo Ancelotti (R) receives a bouquet from CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.

Sokratis Papastathopoulos converted from a Marco Reus free-kick to put Thomas Tuchel’s side in front and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang picked up his 18th and 19th goals of the season to secure the three points. \nDortmund manager Thomas Tuchel hailed his striker’s return to form after a recent dry spell. “We need an Aubameyang who doesn’t think too much and is constantly looking forward to his next goal-scoring opportunity,” Tuchel said. \n“That’s the Aubameyang we need”. \nIn Saturday’s late game, Hertha Berlin defeated the visiting Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0, leapfrogging them into fifth place in the table. \nElsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen slumped to their 10th league defeat of the campaign, going down 2-0 at home to Mainz. \nBottom side Darmstadt’s horror season continued as they went down 2-1 at home to Augsburg despite taking the lead through Marcel Heller early in the second half.

Monaco's Brazilian defender Fabinho (L) and Guingamp's forward Alexandre Mendy. Source: AFP \nReigning champions Paris Saint-Germain are six points behind the leaders in third place before they visit bitter rivals Marseille on Sunday evening. \nTeenage sensation Kylian Mbappe, on from the bench, was put through on goal by Fabinho but was brought down by ‘keeper Karl-Johan Johnsson and a penalty was awarded. \nFalcao missed from the spot against City and also squandered a penalty against Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League earlier in the season. \nFabinho, though, has a superb record from the spot and he scored his 11th penalty out of 11 taken in Ligue 1 in style. \n“They are both great players and expert penalty takers. Neither of them have missed a penalty in Ligue 1, but it was the right decision (to have Fabinho take it),” Jardim said. \nDidot’s crisp finish from the edge of the box had Monaco hanging on for the last few moments, but they held on for the win and are now unbeaten in nine league outings. \nIn later games Lille, under new ownership and with celebrated Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa set to take over in the summer, surrendered a 2-1 lead at home in going down 3-2 to Bordeaux. \nLorient lost 1-0 at Rennes and Bastia went down 3-0 at Angers to leave both deep in relegation trouble. City edge Monaco in classic 1:17 \nSERIE A: Mandzukic inspires Juve to easy Empoli win \nMario Mandzukic overcame a wasteful first half to inspire Juventus to a 2-0 home win over Empoli that edged the Turin giants closer to a record sixth straight Serie A title. \nJuventus, claiming their 22nd win in 26 games, moved 10 points clear of closest challengers Roma ahead of their visit to Inter Milan late on Sunday. \nNapoli remain third but are now 12 points off the pace after a shock 2-0 defeat at home to Atalanta virtually ended their hopes of challenging for a long-awaited scudetto. \nA Roma defeat at the San Siro would deliver a significant blow to their scudetto hopes, but Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said nothing is won yet. \n“Absolutely not,” he said when asked if Juve had one hand on the title. “Roma could be seven points behind us by tomorrow, we still have a lot of games to play, Napoli could get to 90 points and Roma 95. Juventus' forward Mario Mandzukic. Source: AFP \n“We need to win a lot of games and tonight, against Empoli, wasn’t so simple. It took us until the second half to break the deadlock.” \nEarlier, a brace from Juventus-bound Mattia Caldara torpedoed Napoli’s scudetto hopes as 10-man Atalanta underlined their growing Euro ambitions in style with a shock 2-0 win at the San Paolo. \nNapoli welcomed high-flying Atalanta looking to tighten their grip on the third and last Champions League qualifying spot. \nBut less than a week after suffering a 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid in the competition, Maurizio Sarri’s men saw a 14-game unbeaten streak ended by their second successive league defeat to Gian Piero Gasperini’s men. \nAtalanta’s 16th win moved the Bergamo side up to fourth, ahead of Inter Milan before they welcome Roma to the San Siro. \nBut coach Gian Piero Gasperini played down hopes of trying to qualify for the Champions League: “We have already targeted a place in the Europa League.” \nLA LIGA: Sevilla beat rivals Betis to go joint top \nSevilla boss Jorge Sampaoli hailed his side’s second-half “rebellion” to take the spoils once more in the Seville derby with a 2-1 win over Real Betis on Saturday and move joint top of La Liga. \nDanish defender Riza Durmisi’s well-struck free-kick gave Betis a deserved first-half lead. Sevilla's players celebrates after winning. Source: AFP \nHowever, the hosts’ porous defending at set-pieces was exposed as first Gabriel Mercado and then captain Vicente Iborra stretched Sevilla’s unbeaten run over their local rivals to 10 games. \nVictory also takes Sampaoli’s men level on 52 points with Real Madrid. However, the European champions have two games in hand, the first of which comes away to Villarreal on Sunday. \nBarcelona slip to third on 51 points ahead of their trip to Atletico Madrid on Sunday. \n“In the first-half we had zero chance of getting something positive and it took the rebellion of the second-half for that to happen,” said Sampaoli. \n“Betis are one of the teams that have caused us most damage, but we have to keep thinking about what we did in the second-half to be able to dream about staying at the top of the table.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
