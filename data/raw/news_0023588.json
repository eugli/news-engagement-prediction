'Reaching worlds; finding delight in our differences. If you are one of us, and you would like to explore more of this great planet ... we're ready to take you there ... it's time.'\nScroll below for video\nA-list endorsement: Morgan Freeman, 79, delivered a rousing performance in a Turkish Airlines ad broadcast during the Super Bowl on Sunday\nMultiplicity: The ad showed a plane populated with different incarnations of the cerebral Oscar-winner\nThe camera panned out to see multiple incarnations of the five-time Oscar nominee seated on an aircraft, relaxing amid his travel. Then, it showed him seated amid a number of lush backgrounds, such as a gorgeous green field, a snowy mountain and a tropical beach setting.\nThe Academy Award-winning Million Dollar Baby star then plugged the airline with their slogan: 'Widen your world ... Turkish airlines.'\nThe spot, while not overtly political, clearly had undertones of acceptance and diversity, relevant amid the ongoing controversies swirling around U.S. President Donald Trump and his recent motions toward an immigration ban aimed at refugees.\nOne for the sky: The actor delivered a soothing monologue in his trademark tones\nCelebrated: Freeman has been nominated for an Oscar five times, claiming one in 2005 for Million Dollar Baby\nThe Memphis, Tennessee native, who said he voted for Hillary Clinton in the election this past November, recently opened up to AARP: The Magazine in an exclusive excerpt provided to DailyMail.com.\n'Now it feels like we are jumping off a cliff,' he told the publication in the interview, which was conducted prior to Trump's executive orders aimed at refugees last month.\nAll around the world: The ad blended technology and nature to showcase the varied locations the airline takes its passengers\nNeed a jacket: The Shawshank Redemption actor ended the spot imploring viewers to 'widen your world'\nSeeing the world: The advertisement preached tones of wanderlust and embracing different locales\nStaying upbeat: Freeman did not vote for Donald Trump nor does he support his policies, but he is trying to be positive about what the former reality star turned leader of the free world will do\nCover star: The actor spoke in this month's AARP: The Magazine\n'I'm holding out hope that Donald Trump has to be a good president. He can't not be. What I see is a guy who will not lose.'\nMorgan spoke of what it takes to be a great leader when reflecting on meeting and playing the iconic Nelson Mandela.\n'Well, yes, he's a hero, but he's also just a guy. He has all this courage, and that's what it takes to be Mandela. You can do anything with enough kindness and compassion.'\nMorgan has played a president twice - in Deep Impact and Olympus Has Fallen - and even lent his famous voice to an advertisement for Trump's adversary Clinton.\nDeep Impact was released in 1998, long before the U.S. had a black president, and in a time when many thought that may not happen.\nMorgan told the magazine: 'Some people thought Hollywood wasn't ready for a black president, but I didn't consider it.\nPresidential drive: The actor said, 'I'm holding out hope that Donald Trump has to be a good president. He can't not be. What I see is a guy who will not lose'\n'It feels like we are jumping off a cliff': Morgan said he is hoping Trump (pictured Monday) will find his feet\nChanging times: The interview was, however, conducted prior to the recent Executive Orders made by the President (pictured Monday) that included an immigration ban targeting refugees\n'I'm not a professional black actor; I'm a professional actor. I can remember only once in the movies playing black, and that was Driving Miss Daisy.'\nDriving Miss Daisy earned him an Oscar nomination, but it was Million Dollar Baby that saw him finally take home a statute.\nBut after being nominated three times prior to that - and once since - Morgan said it was not as exciting to finally make the podium as you would think.\nImportant qualities: It is not clear if his view has changed in light of recent developments, but the star did speak of what it takes to be a great leader when reflecting on meeting and playing Nelson Mandela, saying 'You can do anything with enough kindness and compassion'\nHe told the magazine: 'The truth? It was anticlimactic. I was up for best actor three times. The Oscar for Million Dollar Baby was for best supporting. I keep the statue at home in a little room in Mississippi that has tchotchkes in it, and all of the high-end awards are there: the Screen Actors Guild, the People's Choice, Golden Globe. I've stopped waiting for the best actor Oscar, because you get to a point where it's better to be nominated over and over. It's more fun that way. You get to stay in that crowd.'\nMorgan now tries to live a quieter life in Mississippi, away from Hollywood and New York.\n'It's beautiful. It's quiet. It's green. I started going to Mississippi in the 1970s, after my folks moved back there. I couldn't do New York anymore â€“ living in a cave, concrete everywhere. I get to have a normal life in Mississippi. Nobody bothers me. I stay home. I golf with friends.\nBeen there done that: Morgan has played a president twice - in Deep Impact (pictured) and Olympus Has Fallen - and even lent his famous voice to an advertisement for Trump's adversary Clinton\n'I go have dinner. I survived inner-city South Side of Chicago, which was a hellhole, and worked hard over the years. I figure I owe it to myself to have some peace at this point in life.'\nBeing a film star came later in life for Morgan after starting of his career in the Air Force before becoming a dancer then an actor in a touring company that saw him become, in his own words, 'a lady-killer'.\nBut, when the world dried up, he then turned into a hot dog sales man.\n'Was I a lady-killer in those days? Big time. Big time. Tall and good looking, what was my secret. We went to 14 cities. A lot of the places were colleges, so it was a feeding ground. But then the show ended, and there was no work. The magic wore off. I got a job and Nedick's, which was like McDonald's before McDonald's caught on.'\nHe was 50 when he landed his breakout movie role in Driving Miss Daisy which landed him an Oscar nomination.\n'I'm 50 years old, playing off-Broadway opposite the incredible Dana Ivey. Driving Miss Daisy changed everything. We heard Warner Bros. was making the movie, but they never hire New York actors.\n'When the movie's director, Bruce Beresford came backstage, I said, ''So, do I get the job?'' he said, ''You're kinda young.'' He wanted Sidney Poitier. But when they went to Sidney, Sidney said, ''Go with the kid.'''\nMorgan has been awarded AARP's Movies for Grownups Achievement Award.\nLong time coming: He was 50 when he landed his break out movie role in Driving Miss Daisy which landed him and Oscar nomination", "external_links": ["http://www.aarp.org/magazine/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-06T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:09:05.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
