Currently only council-controlled secondary schools are advised to teach children about sex in biology classes. \nThere is no such requirement on academies or free schools which make up the majority of secondary schools in England. The changes are proposed in an amendment to the Children and Social Work Bill which was published in the House of Commons last week. \nMs Greening has already hinted that the Government wants to take action, but has yet to publish further information. \nThe changes come after The Telegraph led a Better Sex Education campaign which called for teaching – which has not been changed since 2000 - to be modernised to reflect the risks facing children online.
