His Threat Still Raised Alarm. By Sarah Brown and Katherine Mangan February 03, 2017 President Trump at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday. Earlier that morning, he tweeted his annoyance with Berkeley's decision, amid violent protests, to cancel a conservative speaker's talk. The tweet may have carried a hollow threat, but it put universities on notice that they need to tread carefully in free-speech controversies. B ack in October, when President Trump vowed to \"end\" political correctness on college campuses, it was unclear how the then-presidential candidate planned to go about doing that.\nOn Thursday, he dropped a hint: He threatened to cut off federal funding to the University of California at Berkeley after violent protests there there prompted campus leaders to call off a talk by a far-right provocateur. \nMilo Yiannopoulos is a Breitbart News editor and Trump supporter who has for months traveled to campuses to give talks that often draw protests and have sometimes resulted in violence. He was once permanently banned from Twitter for his role in a harassment campaign against the actress Leslie Jones, and he has drawn heavy fire for his insulting comments about feminists, Black Lives Matters protesters, Islam, and other topics he considers part of leftist ideology. \nMr. Yiannopoulos was scheduled to speak on Berkeley’s campus late Wednesday, as part of his \"Dangerous Faggot\" tour, and more than 1,500 students gathered outside the venue to peacefully protest. Then about 100 additional protesters — mostly nonstudents, Berkeley officials said — joined the fray and hurled smoke bombs, broke windows, and started fires. The violence forced the campus police to put Berkeley on lockdown and led university leaders to cancel the event. \nThe following morning, a political commentator suggested on Fox & Friends First that President Trump should take away Berkeley’s federal funding. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Trump decided to weigh in. If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 \nNot surprisingly, Mr. Yiannopoulos liked that idea. On Facebook Thursday, he linked to a Breitbart article about the federal money Berkeley receives, adding, \"Cut the whole lot, Donald J. Trump.\" \nOthers were quick to condemn the president’s threat. U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, a California Democrat whose district includes the Berkeley campus, tweeted back: \"President Trump doesn’t have a license to blackmail universities. He’s the president, not a dictator, and his empty threats are an abuse of power.\" \nLater, in a statement, Ms. Lee said Mr. Yiannopoulos \"has made a career of inflaming racist, sexist and nativist sentiments.\" Meanwhile, she wrote, \"Berkeley has a proud history of dissent and students were fully within their rights to protest peacefully.\" \nCould Mr. Trump take away a university’s federal funding for what he sees as a violation of the First Amendment? Not on his own, and not entirely, some scholars say, though there are ways he could advocate for cutting some of it. \nRegardless, Mr. Trump’s singling out of Berkeley is worth paying attention to, they say, because it serves as a message to other campus officials that they may soon be put in the position of responding to the president’s social-media whims. How Berkeley Prepared \nBerkeley’s chancellor, Nicholas B. Dirks, went to great lengths last week to explain why the university would not give in to demands to cancel Mr. Yiannopoulos’s appearance. The First Amendment, the chancellor wrote, does not allow the university to censor or prohibit such events. \n\"In our view, Mr. Yiannopoulos is a troll and provocateur who uses odious behavior in part to ‘entertain,’ but also to deflect any serious engagement with ideas,\" Mr. Dirks wrote. \nBut, he added, \"we are defending the right to free expression at an historic moment for our nation, when this right is once again of paramount importance.\" Mr. Dirks went on to warn that the university \"will not stand idly by\" if anyone tries to violate university policies by disrupting the talk. \nStill, the furor over the protests delighted many activists who have been arguing for years that pressure to be politically correct on campuses has stifled those with conservative views. \nAmong them were members of the \"alt-right\" movement, a loosely affiliated group characterized by its white nationalist, sexist, and anti-Semitic views. \nThe group clearly felt vindicated by the president’s assertion that Berkeley doesn’t allow free speech, which came on the heels of the online discussion group Reddit banning an alt-right community for publishing personally identifiable information about people it is criticizing. The Left is trying to shut us down because they are losing. We’re the real opposition on the Right. We’re... https://t.co/Q9HayfRhSD — AltRight.com (@AltRight_com) February 2, 2017 \nOn Thursday, Mr. Dirks released a statement doubling down on his earlier comments about the campus’s commitment to free speech. The violence, he said, was perpetrated by \"more than 100 armed individuals clad all in black who utilized paramilitary tactics to engage in violent, destructive behavior\" designed to shut the event down. \n\"We deeply regret that the violence unleashed by this group undermined the First Amendment rights of the speaker as well as those who came to lawfully assemble and protest his presence.\" \nThe university had anticipated a large crowd of protesters at Mr. Yiannopoulos’s talk on Wednesday night and had brought in dozens of police officers from across the university system to help maintain order. But \"we could not plan for the unprecedented,\" Mr. Dirks wrote. The event was called off only after the campus police concluded that the speaker had to be evacuated for his own safety, he added. “We could not plan for the unprecedented.” Mr. Trump’s threat was also criticized by a group that is known for condemning campuses that it sees as violating free speech rights. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, known as FIRE, released a statement Thursday objecting to \"both violence and attempts to silence protected expression.\"\nThe group said, however, that it had seen no evidence that Berkeley, as an institution, had made any effort to silence Mr. Yiannopoulos, and that the university had, in fact, resisted calls to cancel his visit until the situation got out of hand. \nFIRE added a caution that seemed to be directed at President Trump’s threat to strip funding from Berkeley. \"To punish an educational institution for the criminal behavior of those not under its control and in contravention of its policies, whether through the loss of federal funds or through any other means, would be deeply inappropriate and most likely unlawful,\" its statement said. Withholding Federal Funds \nThe idea of punishing colleges for free-speech controversies was originally Ben Carson’s idea, said Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of the history of education at the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Carson, a neurosurgeon and former Republican presidential candidate, said in October 2015 that he would have the U.S. Department of Education \"monitor our institutions of higher education for extreme political bias and deny federal funding if it exists.\" \nTerry W. Hartle, a senior vice president at the American Council on Education, took the question mark on the end of Mr. Trump’s tweet literally. The president might have been asking, Could I withhold federal funds from Berkeley? Mr. Hartle said.
