NOT!” Trump tweeted. \n \nThis tweet follows a social media dustup that started after Trump alluded to an unknown event in Sweden during a campaign stop in Melbourne, Florida on Saturday. \n\"You look at what's happening in Germany. You look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers and they're having problems like they never thought possible,\" Trump said. He later stated that he was referring to a Fox News story on immigration in Sweden. \nTrump received a swift rebuke on Twitter for his comment. Hashtags, such as #LastNightInSweden and #PrayForSweden, popped up, and dozens of notable people, including Chelsea Clinton, chimed in to criticize the president. \n\nTrump's 'Last night in Sweden' comment fuels Twitter firestorm By Rebecca Morin \nThe Swedish embassy in the U.S. responded to Trump’s tweet on Sunday night, linking to Trump’s tweet referencing the Fox News story and writing, “We look forward to informing the US administration about Swedish immigration and integration policies.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:21:22.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
