However until then expect to hear more things like this big money move. \nAll the talk of China at the moment seems to surround the potential move of Wayne Rooney, especially after Jose Mourinho didn't fully rule out the possibility of his captain moving before Tuesday. \nThis morning Rooney's agent was reportedly spotted in China but most are suggesting that it's more likely the United record scorer won't be moving until the summer, whether that's China or not. \nBut old Wazza isn't the only one being chased from the other side of the world with Tianjin TEDA having reportedly made a £34 million bid for Sporting Lisbon front man Bas Dost. \nDost has had a mixed career, scoring 32 goals in one Eredivise season for Heerenveen, earning himself a move to Germany with Wolfsburg, but only scored more than 10 league goals in one season scoring 16 in 21 appearances in 2014/15. \nIn the summer the Dutch forward got himself an £8 million move to Portugal where he has once again found his scoring boots knocking in 17 goals in just 18 appearances. \nThat prolific rate has clearly caught the eye in China with Sporting set to make a massive £25 million profit in just a few months if they and the player accept the offer. \nShould Dost move to Tianjin then he would join former Premier League players John Obi Mikel and Brown Ideye. \nSam Allardyce tried to sign the 27 year old in the summer when he was Sunderland boss but missed out. \nWho else will move to China?
