The Gabba or Metricon Stadium could stage AFLW grand final is Brisbane finishes on top of the ladder.

SIGN UP NOW > \nMcLachlan said should Carlton and Melbourne finish first and second on the ladder, the grand final “without being definitive” would likely be played at Ikon Park, as AFLW has helped fans connect with the “romance” of the game. \nSpeaking to SEN, McLachlan added that the game would likely to be ticketed to avoid a replica of the Round 1 lockout for the league’s first game between the Blues and the Pies. \nBut the league boss insisted that the grand final — no matter where it was played — would still be free of charge to the public. \nAsked about a better pay deal for AFLW players — the average wage for a player is $8,500 — and the potential renegotiation of the TV broadcast rights, McLachlan said there would be no immediate movement on both fronts until after the two-year deal had ceased. \nOn the expansion of the eight-team AFLW, the league boss said the five clubs with provisional licenses — Geelong, Richmond, West Coast, St Kilda and North Melbourne — would be the “first cabs off the rank” for winning new spots in the competition, with McLachlan revealing the possibility of a 12-team league split into two conferences. \nMcLachlan said he was thrilled with the hype around the competition in its first year. \n“This is here to stay,” McLachlan told SEN on Friday morning. \n“The quality of the game is going to improve dramatically and it’s going to be a big part of the football landscape.” \nHere’s what McLachlan had to say on the other big footy issues. ON THE CBA \nMcLachlan said negotiations between the AFL and the AFL Players’ Association were tracking well, despite no deal being agreed upon less than a month out from Round 1. \n“There’s no issues. We’re working amicably and there’s a lot of things to work through,” McLachlan said. \nThe AFL boss said the two parties were meeting regularly and that the “tonality is good” from the feedback he’s received. \nMcLachlan said the league agreed with the principle of the players being “aligned to the growth of industry”, claiming both parties were “just working through execution”. \n“We’re committed to having a fair deal for the players and if you go in (to negotiations) with that mindset, it’ll happen,” he said. \nMcLachlan’s absence from meetings and discussion with the AFLPA has drawn some criticism, but said a big reason behind that was trusting and “respecting” his staff. \nHe added that he had already met the with the union’s board and made a presentation to it. \nON THE POTENTIAL FOR A TWILIGHT GRAND FINAL \nMcLachlan said a decision on the timeslot of this year’s AFL Grand Final would be made prior to Round 1, adding that a twilight match could “technically” occur. \nIf not this year, McLachlan said a twilight Grand Final would happen at some stage during the league’s six-year broadcast deal. \nHe said he was a big fan of the twilight timeslot, pointing to the thrilling atmosphere of last year’s preliminary final between the GWS Giants and Western Bulldogs at Spotless Stadium. \n“If you were at the GWS prelim last year, there was something special about starting the game in the day and finishing in the night,” McLachlan said. \nMcLachlan said the league faced a tough call on when and how to implement a twilight Grand Final, saying balancing the pros of a bigger TV audience and the night atmosphere with the cons of potentially hindering tradition and history was a difficult task. \nHe also joked that his ideal musical act at Grand Final would be Bruce Springsteen. \nON THE CENTRE BOUNCE \nMcLachlan was also asked about the hot topic of the week in the longevity of the centre bounce, with fresh calls this week to scrap it altogether. \nWhile he didn’t shed any light on its future, he admitted he wasn’t aware until this week of the link between the bounce and injuries and issues umpires faced. \nMcLachlan also said it could be a big barrier for aspiring AFL umpires who have come from a local level. \n“It’s a difficult skill that prohibits a lot umpires from making it to the highest level because they can’t perfect it, including females,” McLachlan said. \nON THE 17-5 FIXTURE \nLastly, McLachlan said the 17-5 fixture model is being discussed as a potential fixture solution at league headquarters. \nWhile the positives to the model are obvious, McLachlan said it was important to identify the cons as well. \n“Looking at it, we’ve got to work out the problems with it, because there’s a lot of upside,” McLachlan said. \nHe said one of the big issues club memberships, as the lack of security and certainty could make selling packages difficult.
