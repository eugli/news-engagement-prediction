As he announced on Twitter, he bought out every showing of Jordan Peele’s new horror film Get Out today at Chicago’s Chatham 14 theaters on 87th Street so everyone who wants to see it can do so for free: I bought all the tickets to #GetOut at Chatham Theatre on 87th Just pull up with ID and enjoy the movie. — Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) February 26, 2017 \nEarlier this morning Chance tweeted that Get Out was “incredible” and the “best film across any genre in a while,” so clearly he’s pretty hyped on the movie. Chance hasn’t really said anything else about why he decided to do this, so it really just seems like an excuse to do a cool and fun thing for the people of his city. DID I NOT TELL YALL #GETOUT WAS INCREDIBLE!! BEST FILM ACROSS ANY GENRE IN AWHILE GO SEE IT TODAY! Cc: @LilRel4 @JordanPeele — Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) February 26, 2017 \nHe also tweeted that he just left the area around the theater but might go back for a later showing, so you might want to hang around 87th if you’d like a chance to see Get Out with a Grammy winner. Who needs to watch the Oscars anyway? It’s already bussin, I just left and might have to come back for a later showing!! #getout https://t.co/tlWWspgMH5 — Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) February 26, 2017 \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:15:54.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
