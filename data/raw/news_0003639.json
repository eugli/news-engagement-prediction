Afinidad-Bernardo (philstar.com) | Updated February 3, 2017 - 10:27am Feng shui expert Princess Lim Fernandez Released \nMANILA, Philippines — January 28 might be the first day of the Chinese lunar year, but February 3 is the official beginning of the Year of the Fire Rooster. Babies born after 11:36 p.m. on February 3 will already belong to the Fire Rooster Zodiac sign, while those before that hour still have the Fire Monkey as Zodiac sign. \nAccording to feng shui expert Princess Lim Fernandez of the Yin & Yang Shop of Harmony at New World Hotel, February 3 is considered “Everybody’s Birthday” and thus, is considered as a day of celebration and gatherings. She suggests marking this day with noodles for longevity and good health. \nHere are Fernandez’s prescriptions for every animal sign for the entire year. \nRooster – There is career good luck, but not so in relationships and health, so rejuvenate and do not attend wakes and funerals. Be careful not to engage in conflict. Nonetheless, you have the chance to shine and show off your skills. \nRabbit – Watch out for injuries; be careful when driving, walking and spending because money will be “easy comes, easy goes.” Invest more in tangible assets. Stay out of funerals, invest in visible assets, and go to happy occasions to imbibe good energy or positive “chi.” This is the best time to return to school or study more. \nDragon – This sign is the compatible sign of the Rooster. This is your time to go out and shine. Lifestyle Feature ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: \nSnake – This year will not be as rosy as last year, so think things through before you make a decision and before you act. \nHorse – The more you travel, the more you earn. This sign, this year, is one of the luckiest signs of the Zodiac, because it has the phoenix star, which is the benevolence star, and two prosperity stars. So, if you have investments last year, this year, you will earn more from those. But horses this year has a negative romance star, so love will be have a bittersweet romance. Do not overindulge. \nGoat – Watch out for backstabbing and what you say because once you said something, you cannot take it back. You will be riddled with criticism, but do not be impatient. Watch your health, do not tire yourself. \nMonkey – You had a bad year last year, but it will be better this year. You will have some opportunities for travel and merriment. Watch your health. Do not sacrifice sleep. Prioritize getting enough rest. This year, you have opportunities for travel. \nDog – You had a fluctuating year last year, but you have lucky stars this year. The dog has a good male benefactor. There will a good chance for promotion or career growth. But try not to be too emotional.Do not let your emotions get the better of you. If you feel it coming, take a break and change environment. Do something different. \nTiger – Last year was rough, with many ups and downs. This year, you can rest well because there will be more progress and money luck. Put water in the southeast, near your kitchen. \nPig – It will be a tough year ahead. Travel more so negative stars will not follow you. If you are following the same routine, eventually, you will fall off. If you travel, you can start afresh. \nRat – You have a happiness star this year, so there will be occasions for celebrations. But be careful not to miss even small details because if you do, the result will not be good. \nOx – You have an achievement star but it comes with a price, so nurture your relationships. \nSheep – You will hit it big time. \nKnowing what lies ahead, Fernandez says, enables one to plan ahead and to not take things for granted.
