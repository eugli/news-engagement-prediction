Photo via the men's basketball team's Twitter feed \nTravis Ford’s mind had moved well past the events of Wednesday night when he walked into the best attended news conference of the season Thursday at Chaifetz Arena. \nThe St. Louis University basketball coach had watched game tape all morning in preparation for his team’s next game, and he had a practice to run. But there was a little matter that he had been asked to address. \n“I appreciate everybody coming out to talk about last night’s game and Saturday’s big game,” he said with a straight face. “I’m sure that’s why you’re here.” \nAt least that was his wish. \nInstead, Ford faced a steady stream of questions about the driver and team bus that disappeared from the arena at St. Bonaventure in New York, leaving the travel party temporarily stranded. He was at times clearly uncomfortable talking about an incident that resulted in the arrest of the driver, who was charged with driving while intoxicated in a commercial vehicle. \nThe impact on the Billikens, he said repeatedly, was insignificant. The departure from the arena was delayed an hour and a half. Another bus delivered the team to pick up its belongings in the original bus. The team then went to the airport to catch its chartered flight. \n“Our team is safe and we made it back after we were delayed a little bit,” Ford said. “It was unfortunate. There’s another side that is someone’s life. I got up and prayed for the lady this morning. I feel for her.” \nBus driver Linda Edmister was picked up by the New York State Police and arrested after a test showed her with a blood-alcohol content of 0.22 percent, which is more than five times the legal limit of 0.04 percent for commercial drivers. \nShe had driven the Billikens to their hotel when they arrived the day before the game, to practice and to the arena Wednesday. \n“I did spend a little time with her in a 24-hour period,” Ford said. “She was nice.” \nEdmister was still in the bus outside the arena with about eight minutes left in the game when a SLU manager went outside to retrieve pizzas that had been delivered for the team’s postgame meal. \nWhen players emerged after the game, a 70-55 loss, the bus was gone. \nThe SLU women’s team will play at St. Bonaventure on Saturday and will charter a flight. \nAthletics director Chris May said the school has used the Grand Tours company for transportation with no previous issues. \n“Obviously this is a tough deal for them,” May said. “We’ve never had a problem. If there was ever an indication of a problem, you ask questions, which we’re doing now, making sure the women get there. There’s no reason to believe there will be (a problem) again.” \nThe bus was able to be tracked because Ford had left his iPad onboard, allowing for a GPS app to be used to find the bus’s location. The driver had gone from Olean, N.Y., to Randolph, N.Y., which is about 40 miles west. \nSt. Bonaventure athletic officials worked with the police and arranged for another bus to take the SLU contingent to Randolph. After picking up personal and team belongings, including some player IDs, the players and coaches traveled 40 miles in the new bus to an airport in Pennsylvania to catch the flight. \n“St. Bonaventure was unbelievable,” Ford said. “If not, we wouldn’t have made it back. ... They were on top of it.” \nThe story took off on social media, catching Ford by surprise. He heard from friends and family after the game as people sought to make sure the players and coaches were OK. Meanwhile, photos were posted of players waiting in the arena while playing cards and sleeping in lounge chairs. \nThat was preferred to the option of being in the bus with an intoxicated driver. \n“We talked about that,” Ford said. “Things happen for a reason. From that standpoint it was positive. Our team is OK. She’s OK — no accident occurred. ... I worry about my kids driving every day with drunk people on the roads. We hear about bus accidents, and there was one with Georgetown the other day. It can happen, but I’m glad it didn’t.” \nThe Billikens returned to St. Louis a bit later than scheduled, getting to the campus at 2:30 a.m. Ford was up early to begin preparation for Saturday’s game against Duquesne.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:43:19.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
