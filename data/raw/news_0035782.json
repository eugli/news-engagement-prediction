The superstar, who has previously hosted several hit shows on small screen is set tor turn host for yet another biggie. \nTED (Technology, Entertainment, and Design) talks will be featured in a language other than English and this will be for the first time ever. Star India is coming up with `TED Talks India: Nayi Soch` to be hosted by SRK. \nAccording to ANI, this is for the first time that TED, a nonprofit organisation has tied up with a major network and star to produce a TV series featuring original TED Talks in a different language, reports The Hollywood Reporter. \nThe show will air on Star Plus and feature speakers sharing big ideas in TED`s signature format of short talks. \nShah Rukh Khan, has previously hosted shows like 'Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?' 'Kaun Banega Crorepati'. \nANI quotes him as saying, \"Star India`s legacy of using television as an instrument of social change, and TED`s unequivocal drive to showcase simple but unique ideas in an effort to spark debate and conversation are a very powerful combination. I believe `TED Talks India: Nayi Soch` will inspire many minds across India. It is a concept I connected with instantly, as I believe that the media is perhaps the single most powerful vehicle to inspire change.\" \nThe show will launch later this year. However, further details such as a specific date and a lineup of speakers have not been revealed. \n(With ANI inputs) First Published: Thursday, February 16, 2017 - 12:01 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:01:25.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
