SUPPLIED \nVolunteers rescued a girl, bottom left, from under the rubble of a collapsed building in the Tishreen neighbourhood of Damascus. \nIt showed its volunteers trying to rescue a girl from under the rubble of a collapsed building after an airstrike on the Tishreen neighbourhood. \nREAD MORE: \nThe rescuers said the words 'God is great, God is great' as the girl, who the Daily Mail reported was called Aya, was taken to safety. SUPPLIED \nThe girl is pulled from the rubble alive. \nThe extent of her injuries were unclear. \nJets believed to belong to the Russian or Syrian Air Forces pounded the Barzeh and Qaboun neighbourhoods in the northeast corner of the capital, leveling several buildings, and also wounded at least 12 people, the activist-run Barzeh Media Center and Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. \nThe side-by-side Barzeh, Qaboun, and Tishreen neighborhoods form one of the last two footholds of the Syrian opposition inside the Damascus city limits. \nThe two neighbourhoods connect to a vast, opposition-held district in the suburbs of the capital through a network of smuggling tunnels, according to Syria researcher Aron Lund, in a report for the US-based Century Foundation policy institute. Ad Feedback \nPro-government forces have so far failed to collapse rebel defenses inside the Eastern Ghouta district, despite besieging them there since 2013. \nAlso on Monday (Tuesday NZT), the Russian military reported the deaths of four of its servicemen when they their vehicle was struck by a roadside in the centre of the country last Thursday. \nThe loss raised the total Russian combat casualties so far in Syria's war to 27. \nThe four died when they were travelling as part of a Syrian military convoy to the central city of Homs on Thursday from the Tiyas air base, which is close to the ancient town of Palmyra held by the Islamic State group. \nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the bomb was detonated by remote control. Two other servicemen were wounded in the blast. \nPalmyra, about 60 kilometres away, is one of the focal points of the battle against the extremist group. \nNo group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but blame is likely to fall on IS. - AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:30:44.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
