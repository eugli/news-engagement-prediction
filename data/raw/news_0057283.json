So no, I don’t see that challenge,” he added, referring to the racial makeup of the city’s ACS workers. In Fiscal Year 2015, 81 percent of the agency’s more than 6,000 employees were black or Latino, one of the highest percentages of minority employees among city agencies. \n“I’ve always tried to give the mayor the benefit of the doubt, but at this point, I’m going to say the mayor is using alternative truths,” said Joyce McMillan, director of programming at the Child Welfare Organizing Project. She said there is \"absolutely\" racism in the child welfare system. \n“How can there not be, when disproportionately it’s only people of color who are affected? How can it not be?” \nDe Blasio made the remarks while announcing his appointment of new ACS Commissioner David Hansell following the resignation of Gladys Carrion, who stepped down as head of the agency after the high-profile deaths of several children in the city’s child welfare system. \nThe mayor’s statements on the role race plays in the city’s system contradict statements Carrion made while she was serving as ACS commissioner. \nIn a 2015 interview with Al Jazeera, Carrion said racism was one of the factors contributing to disproportionately high numbers of black children in the child welfare system. \"I think we should be honest about that,” Carrion said at the time. She added that she didn't think there was \"intentional racism at work\" in the system, but said \"we certainly see the net result.\" \nDe Blasio’s remarks also contradict the city’s ACS website . “Racial Disproportionality refers to the overrepresentation of children of color in child and family serving systems, and can be attributed to multiple factors including racism, poverty, less than responsive organizational culture and service strategies, and inadequate resources,” the website says. \nIn a statement Tuesday evening, de Blasio press secretary Eric Phillips said the mayor actually does agree that racial bias is a factor in how families come into the child welfare system, but said the agency itself isn’t biased. \n“Commissioner Carrion has said there are bias issues involved how families come into contact with an agency like ACS. The mayor agrees with that. That, of course, does not mean that the organization itself is any more or less prone to an internal culture of bias than anyone else. In fact, as the mayor made clear, the ACS workforce is among the most culturally diverse and racially reflective in government,” Phillips said. \nThe mayor’s ACS comments, though, mark a stark contrast to the way he speaks about the impact of structural racism and individual bias in the city’s police force. During his first term as mayor, de Blasio implemented a requirement for police officers of all backgrounds to undergo implicit bias training, a measure he has said will help address continuing disparities in the numbers of black people arrested for low-level marijuana offenses, for example. \n“I’m very proud, right now with the NYPD, we’re introducing Implicit Bias Training to say explicitly, we are all humans, we all come with biases, we have to explicitly help our police officers to understand those biases, to weed them out,” de Blasio said in February last year, during an interview with the New York Times’s Paul Krugman. \nBut the NYPD is also whiter than ACS — 52 percent of its more than 52,000 employees were black or Hispanic in 2015, while 40 percent were white. \nDe Blasio’s nuanced remarks on racial bias in policing, which criminal justice reform advocates say has had an outsized impact on people of color in New York City, made de Blasio’s comments Tuesday all the more surprising to child welfare advocates, who say the child welfare system is analogous to the criminal justice system in its potentially devastating impact on poor people of color. \n“For a mayor who has shown such sensitivity to racism in the criminal/legal system, it’s really troubling that he’s so blithely overlooking it in the child welfare system,” said Lisa Sangoi, the Soros Justice Advocacy Fellow at NYU Law’s Family Defense Clinic. \nChild welfare experts said a diverse workforce at the ACS isn’t necessarily a prophylactic against bias. \n“I don’t think implicit bias only refers to white people looking at people of color,” said Nora McCarthy, who heads Rise, an organization that represents families who’ve been involved with the city’s child welfare system. \n“It’s better to have a diverse workforce, but I don’t think a diverse workforce is necessarily protective against implicit bias,” McCarthy said. \nResearchers who study the country's child welfare systems generally agree that racism accounts for at least some part of the disproportionate representation of black and Latino children in the systems. That problem, experts say, extends to New York City. \nIn New York City, in 2010, “relative to white children, black children are 5.2 times as likely to be reported to SCR, 6.6 times as likely to be indicated, 13.6 times as likely to be admitted to foster care, and 13.4 times as likely to be in care,” according to data from the state’s Office for Children and Family Services. \nThose statistics show the disproportionate representation of black children in the child welfare system at every single stage. \nIn 2010, black children made up 28.2 percent of the population of children under 18 in New York City, but comprised 38.7 percent of the reports of abuse or neglect to the state’s registry and 46.6 percent of the children entering foster care, according to the most recent available data from OCFS. White children made up 27 percent of the child population in the city, but comprised just 7.1 percent of all reports of abuse or neglect made to the central registry and made up just 3.3 percent of the population entering foster care. \n“In both NYC and rest of state, as measured by rate per 1 000 children in population, black children are more likely than Hispanic children, and Hispanic children are more likely than white children, to be reported to SCR, indicated for abuse/neglect, enter foster care, and in care,” OCFS reported in 2011. \nChild welfare advocates say that the vast majority of ACS investigations in New York City are for reports of neglect, as opposed to abuse. Neglect is defined as “failure of a parent or caretaker to provide needed food, clothing, shelter, medical care, or supervision to the degree that the child’s health, safety, and well-being are threatened with harm,” while abuse is inflicting physical or sexual abuse on a child. \n“What’s racist about it is that they misconstrue, purposely, poverty to be neglect,” said McMillan. “They say the parent didn’t have adequate housing for the child. That’s not an issue of neglect -- that’s an issue of poverty. They say the parent didn’t have adequate food - that’s not an issue of neglect, it’s an issue of poverty,” she said. \n\"Until New York City does more to address poverty, neglect cases will continue,\" said Emma Ketteringham, managing attorney at the Bronx Defenders’ Family Defense Practice. \nShe said \"the vast majority\" of families in the child welfare system are there not because of abuse, but because they are charged with neglect due to homelessness, lack of quality child care, and the private means to address a crisis.\" \n“Until we address an economic system that entraps 40 percent of African-American children in poverty and continue to fail to address the disadvantage and material conditions of low income families in our city, children — and particularly children of color — will continue to suffer the trauma and countless disadvantages of being removed from their homes and growing up in foster care,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:53:54.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
