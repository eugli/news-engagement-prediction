Here are a range of Valentine’s Day treats to spoil your loved one — from cheap as chips to high-end dining. \nSome loved-up couples will be splashing out well over $100 per person on multi-course menus, with high end restaurants across Brisbane reporting strong bookings — some up 10 per cent on last year. \nBrisbane riverside Japanese eatery Sake is one such venture, with diners forking out $110 for their seven-course dinner with champagne. \n“Despite the lure of a more casual dining scene across Brisbane, when romance is in the air customers are still willing to splurge on that special someone,” said Rockpool Dining Group CEO Thomas Pash, which are behind Sake. \nIt’s a similar story at South Brisbane fine diner Bacchus at Rydges hotel, which has sold out its $169 a head dinner tonight, following a flurry of last-minute bookings over the weekend. \n“It started out a little bit slowly, but we just put it down to the fact that it’s fallen on a Tuesday night this year,” Rydges executive chef Dominic Rose said.
