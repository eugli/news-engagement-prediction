Sheppard yanked from committee after voting against tax cuts jason sheppard.JPG Rep. Jason Sheppard, R-Temperance, was relieved of a committee assignment after allegedly lying about which way he'd vote on a plan to cut the income tax. (Courtesy of Michigan House of Representatives) comments \nLANSING, MI -- Rep. Jason Sheppard, R-Temperance, was swiftly relieved of a committee chairmanship less than an hour after voting against a proposal to cut the state's income tax. \nSheppard was one of 12 Republican representatives who voted against the tax cut, which went down 52-55. But he was the only one, said Rep. Tom Leonard, who lied about it. \n\"The representative from Monroe County looked me in the eyes, told me he was going to be a yes vote, and voted no,\" Leonard told reporters after a 12-hour meeting of the body that resulted in the failed vote. \nThe proposed tax cut would have taken the Michigan income tax from 4.25 percent to 3.9 percent over four years, provided the state's rainy day fund had more than $1 billion in it for the last two years of implementation. \nMichigan House votes down income tax cut after late-night session \nThe House Clerk after lawmakers had exited the chamber read Sheppard's punishment into the record: Leonard was removed as chair of the House Financial Services Committee. \nHe was replaced by Rep. Diana Farrington, R-Utica, who had previously served as majority vice chair. That position will be filled by Rep. Joe Graves, R-Argentine Twp., who will join the committee. Both Farrington and Graves voted for the tax cut plan. \nLeonard spokesperson Gideon D'Assandro said Leonard removed Sheppard from the committee because Sheppard lied. \n\"He's got to have people on the Financial Services Committee that he can trust, the Michigan taxpayers need people on the Financial Services Committee that they can trust,\" D'Assandro said. Sheppard did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this article. He remains a member of the Health Policy and Tourism and Outdoor Recreation committees.
