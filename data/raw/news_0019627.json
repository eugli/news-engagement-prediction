About 7 arrests made without force. Everyone remains safe so far. Hoping for continued cooperation and no more criminal conduct.\nâ€” Phoenix Police (@phoenixpolice) February 9, 2017 Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, the woman in the van, was arrested in a 2008 ICE workplace raid, convicted of a felony and served six months in ICE detention before being released later that year, according to CNN affiliate KPHO/KTVK . On Wednesday, Garcia de Rayos showed up at the ICE office for a routine immigration check. She was then issued an order of deportation. It's not clear if she was being taken by van to be deported immediately or if she would be held at a detention center. Read More Garcia de Rayos could be the first Arizonan to be deported under the President Donald Trump's new executive order focused on removing undocumented immigrants with a history of arrests, Garcia's attorney told CNN affiliate KNXV . Immigrant rights group Puente Arizona says that Garcia is a victim of the policies of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Workplace raids, like the one where Garcia was arrested nine years ago, were unconstitutional and amounted to racial and ethnic profiling, the group says.. I n 2015 , a federal judge ordered Arpaio to stop enforcing identity theft laws, one of the most well-known tools used to crack down on illegal immigration in the border state by the man who called himself America's toughest sheriff. Controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio loses In 2013, a judge ordered a federal monitor to keep tabs on Arpaio's office and make sure officers weren't racially profiling. His reelection run was imperiled when a federal judge ordered him to be tried on a criminal contempt charge, accusing him of disobeying a court order in a racial-profiling case. Protesters gather Garcia de Rayos' husband and teenage children also joined protesters outside ICE headquarters on Wednesday evening. \"I'd ask him 'why he would want to take her from me?' She hasn't done anything wrong and I'm not scared of him,\" said Garcia's daughter Jaqueline, told CNN affiliate KNXV , of what she would ask President Trump if she could. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released the following statement to CNN affiliate KNXV in regards to Garcia de Rayos' case: \"Ms. Garcia De Rayos is currently being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) based on a removal order issued by the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review which became final in May 2013. Relevant databases indicate Ms. Garcia De Rayos has a prior felony conviction dating from March 2009 for criminal impersonation.\" A crackdown on illegal immigration The immigration executive orders signed by President Trump could amount to a vast expansion of authority for individual immigration officers and a dramatic increase in efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. The order lays out a series of categories of undocumented immigrants that immigration law enforcement officials should prioritize for removing from the country, a reaction to what was criticized by the right as lax enforcement of immigration law by former President Barack Obama. The Obama administration had prioritized expulsion of undocumented immigrants who threatened public safety or national security, had ties to criminal gang activity, committed serious felony offenses or were habitual misdemeanor criminal offenders. Trump's order goes far beyond that, using a sweeping definition of \"criminal\" and giving a single immigration officer the ability to make judgments on threats to public safety. The order says the priority will be removing deportable immigrants who \"have been convicted of any criminal offense; have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved; have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense; have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency; have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or in the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T12:55:40.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
