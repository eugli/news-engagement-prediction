It is the thought rather than the act which is reprehensible. 12497 @Madhulika_ra Ostentatious, vulgar and uncalled for. Perhaps these are words which come to mind when you see politicians splurge innocuously without batting an eyelid. The curious case of Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, popularly known as KCR, who offered jewellery worth about Rs 5.59 crore to Lord Venkateswara Swamy in Tirumala Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh on behalf of his government, is not the first and nor is it going to be the last. The act in itself holds a record of sorts. KCR , who was the flagbearer of the agitation for a separate Telangana state, had taken a vow during the movement that he would offer gold jewellery to Lord Venkateswara, also known as Lord Balaji if Telangana got statehood. In the country where political ambition has taken a form akin to holding a kingdom rather than entering public service for the good of the public, acts like the above would perhaps increase in the years to come. Appeasement of God in the said way seems to be the most likely consequence of a fulfilled wish. It is ironic that the wealthiest temples have their home in this country, given the palpable poverty which co-exists right outside the temple premise. It is futile to count the ways the money could have been used for the development of the state, which in turn could have ensured long-term benefits not only to the state but to the man himself. If KCR would have been prudent enough to allocate the money more judiciously, would he not be hailed as a politician? It is the thought rather than the act which is reprehensible. The thought that a chadava or a bribe to a deity would reap us benefits. An act which has so seamlessly pervaded the psyche that it seems like the most natural thing to be done. Pleasing the deity translating into pleasing the one who holds power. It seems that even though singular acts like KCRâ€™s would indeed draw flak, no one would question the premise of the same. The premise which has led us to believe that pleasing or sycophancy or some sort to the deity (can be exchanged for a boss, political leader) would indeed yield results, which actual work would not. Is it not time where merit be the judge rather than the targeted pleasing? If KCR would have been prudent enough to allocate the money more judiciously, would he not be hailed as a politician? But it is a mindset which makes us believe that the act is justifiable, a mindset which is seen in the countrymen they rule over. While some would come out and call it a reprehensible act, someone somewhere would be planning to appease the lord with an increased sum if his wish were to get fulfilled. #Gold , #Telangana , #KCR The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of DailyO.in or the India Today Group.
