Staff members in the offices of Ryan and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady referred questions about it to the White House. A spokesman for McConnell had no immediate comment after a scheduled meeting Friday between the Kentucky Republican and the president. \nTrump's mention of a tax outline on Thursday took House and Senate Republicans by surprise, said Henrietta Treyz, a macroeconomic policy analyst at Height Securities, an investment-research firm. She cited conversations with high-level congressional staff members. \"It was news to them; they had no idea it was coming,\"she said. \nRegardless, GOP leaders in the House broadly expect Trump will support their tax plans, which include a controversial proposal to tax US companies on their domestic sales and imports, while excluding their exports, Treyz said. Ad Feedback \nCohn said last week that he has been meeting with members of Congress and working on two key goals: cutting corporate income taxes and individual income taxes. He emphasised during a Feb. 3 interview with Fox Business News that he has been focused on tax cuts for low earners. \n\"We're not spending a lot of time with the high earners,\" Cohn said during that interview. \nDuring his campaign, Trump adopted a plan favoured by House Republican leaders that would consolidate the existing seven individual income-tax rates to just three. The top rate would be reduced from 39.6 per cent to 33 per cent. \nCohn also said during an interview on CNBC last week that all options for corporate tax reform are being considered, including the plan favored by Ryan that would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 per cent and tax US companies on their domestic income and imports, while exempting their exports and offshore income. That so-called \"border-adjusted\" plan has run into widespread opposition from retailers, oil refiners and other industries. Major exporters, including companies like General Electric Co., have expressed support. \nThe former banker has also called for using proceeds from a special tax on US companies' offshore earnings to help fund an ambitious public-works program. Under current US tax law, companies can defer paying income taxes on their offshore profit until they return those earnings to the US As a consequence, US companies have stockpiled an estimated US$2.6 trillion ($3.6 trillion) in income offshore. \nTrump campaigned on a plan to apply a much lower tax rate - 10 per cent or less as opposed to 35 per cent - to those overseas corporate earnings. Companies would then be free to return that money to America if they wished, and the US Treasury would see a multibillion-dollar infusion. \nSome Trump advisers have suggested using receipts from that \"repatriation\" tax to pay for US$137 billion in tax credits for private businesses that invest in public-works improvements. In all, Trump has called for spending as much as US$1 trillion to upgrade roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure. - The Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:36:54.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
