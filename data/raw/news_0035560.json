It's not too bad, it's a nice place, shut up ya face \nFirst was that Australian home prices relative to incomes are pretty much in line with comparable countries.

(Supplied: RBA) \nThe problem is that many of the countries we are compared to are widely argued to have housing bubbles of their own, such as New Zealand and several large cities in Canada. \nIncidentally, Ms Ellis' own graph shows that Australia's price-to-income ratio is around the level Spain's was at the time of its property market crash, while the fact that we are a little short of Ireland's pre-crash peak surely shouldn't offer too much comfort. Rich hold debts \nSecondly, Ms Ellis argues that Australia's high mortgage debts are relatively safe because the biggest debts tend to be held by higher income households. \n\"Most of the mortgage debt in Australia has been borrowed by those most able to service it,\" she boasts. \nSuperficially, this makes sense. But think about how high some of the debts are for those wealthier households, as well as their generally much larger living expenses, and how safe from default are they?

(Supplied: RBA) \nHow many dual income, high earning households are there in Australia who could keep paying their mortgage if one partner lost their job and couldn't find another one for six months or more? \nCertainly, the older ones who might have got ahead on their mortgage and paid much of it off would probably be OK (and of course the older age groups are more likely to be in the higher earning category), but what about the younger, recent buyers? \nThat's not to mention the inequality that Ms Ellis skirts over, trumpeting the fact that most investment property debt is held by higher income households, without joining the dots that this is making lower income families the rental serfs of a landed class. Relationship status determines housing status \nA third argument is that the falling rate of home ownership amongst younger people (25-34 years old) started before home prices really took off in the mid to late-1990s, and is therefore due to demographic change more than lack of affordable housing for purchase. \nThere's probably truth in this, but it ignores another steep downturn in ownership rates amongst this demographic from the mid-2000s. \nIt also ignores the fact that ownership rates have also dropped noticeably in the 35-44 and even 45-54 demographics, with a smaller decline for older groups.

No-deposit home loans a recipe for financial disaster \nNo such reservations from Nationals MP Andrew Broad, however. \nHe has floated the idea of no-deposit loans for people who can present three years of reliable rental history. \nThis is financial lunacy. \nThe idea of a deposit when buying a home is to protect both the bank and the buyer. Renters in Australia are putting up with poor-quality housing for fear of being thrown out. \nFor the bank it means that it is unlikely to take a loss if the borrower defaults — unless the home's value has fallen by more than the size of the deposit since the loan was issued. \nFor the borrower it means that they have a buffer against going bankrupt if they default on their home loan. \nWithout a deposit, if the home's value has declined when the bank repossesses and sells it, the borrower is liable for the difference. If they don't have the cash, and can't cut a deal with the bank, they're bankrupt. \nFor the financial system and economy as a whole, widespread no-deposit lending would probably push home prices even higher and then expose banks to large losses and potential collapse in the event of a real estate crash. \nInstead of finding new and ever more creative ways of boosting demand and further stretching Australians' already tortured ability to pay for over-priced homes, how about we look at some ways to start kicking our housing habit? \nCapital gains tax discount reduction, negative gearing reform and/or a national land tax could be a start. \nAfter all, increasing tobacco taxes has helped Australia in the battle against smoking, so why not raise property taxes in the fight against non-productive land speculation?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:50:42.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
