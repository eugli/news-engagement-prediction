You define yourself as an athlete, are very skilled at your craft, and have given 100% to be the best you can be. You’ve enjoyed championships, awards, and accolades from friends, parents, faculty, the media, and almost everyone you meet. You’re pretty pumped about the prospect of playing at the next level! \nWhy not, right? \nBefore I answer that question, let’s be clear: I absolutely love sports. I love to watch. I love to play and I particularly enjoy college sports. I strongly believe that college athletics provide amazing opportunities to students to go to exceptional schools and get life-changing educations. \nSo, my perspective isn’t that of a “hater.” I just want to bring a bit of reality to the party. Also, my son was talented enough to play at the D1 level, but ultimately chose not to play after receiving a unique academic opportunity that led him to pass on doing so. Given that, I have first-hand experience, having been through the college recruitment process as a parent. \nAll that said, playing college sports is not a risk-free proposition. There are definite tradeoffs involved, and you’ll want to navigate the process wisely to make winning choices in your decision-making process. Below are questions you should definitely ask yourself before choosing to play college sports at a given school. Would You Attend This School If You Weren’t an Athlete? \nThis is a critical starting point – and a question that you must answer honestly. Choosing a school that is not a fit based on your academic profile so you can play sports is significant life decision. \nSaid another way, if you scored a 27 on your ACT, but a school recruiting you has an average of a 22, you’re academically overqualified for the school. On the other hand, if you scored a 25, and a school has an average ACT of a 32, this can be an incredible win for you, if you’re willing to work hard in the classroom. \nAll colleges are not created equally. All programs of study within a college are not created equally. \nIf you choose a college without a strong reputation in your field of study or a strong overall “brand” to play your sport, you may not be making a great long-term decision. By the way, beyond looking at admissions data, one other great way to kick the tires is by visiting the career center at a given school to find out who hires student from that school (and in what number) in the major you’re interested in pursuing. Is it “really” a good financial deal? \nEveryone loves to get a scholarship. It’s free money, sounds great to family and friends, and can significantly lower the cost of getting an education. Both a student and her parents feel like they were “successful” in the process and that all the hard work and cost of getting there paid off. Tough to argue with this, right? \nWell, maybe. \nIf the school offering you the scholarship has an annual price tag of $50,000, including room and board, and you’re splitting a scholarship with 4 other students, so getting a $10,000 reduction, is that really a better deal than attending a great state school that costs $27,000 at full price? It may still be a good choice to attend the more expensive school if it is an outstanding academic institution (see question #1), but otherwise, the math doesn’t work to go to the “scholarship” school. Will You Be a Student-Athlete or an Athlete-Student? \nCollege sports require a great deal of time. That time can be time spent on your passion – which is wonderful, but at a Division 1 school, the commitment can be as much as five to six hours per day, six days a week while your sport is in season, and two to three hours per day when your sport is of season. \nAdd game days — both home and away — to the mix, and it’s a huge commitment. \nThe commitment at a Division 2 school may be a little less, and a Division 3 school substantially less, but practice time plus training time will eat up a huge part of your day. And, regardless of the level at which you’re playing, your coach wants to win – so he or she is likely trying to outwork their conference opponents to better prepare you to make a run at a conference championship next year. \nSome academically elite Division 1 schools (and many Division 2 and 3 schools), will be more committed to your academic success than other schools, but understand a given school’s athlete graduation rate, what jobs those grads have gotten in the past couple of years, and talk to players to get a sense of how committed the coaching staff is to truly allowing you to be a “student-athlete.” Will You Go Pro and Make a Living Doing This? \nI would be neglectful if I didn’t mention this issue. If you have the right physical tool set, work ethic, play the right sport, stay healthy, and have a number of other variables fall into place, you could play in “the league” in your given sport. If you were Mr. or Mrs Basketball in Indiana and are going to a D1 school on a full ride, you have a legitimate shot of being in the less than 1% of NCAA athletes who go pro in their sport and make a living doing so. In this case, I might be willing to compromise on your academic fit and other factors mentioned above, but please be realistic in your assessment of your chances of going pro in your sport before doing so. \nAs a final thought, for the next 60+ years of your life, when you meet someone, one of the first questions he or she will ask you is “where did you go to school?” Make sure you feel good about answering that question with the name of the school you’ll be attending before you sign on the line. If you do, you’re in a great spot – and ready to move forward. \nPlaying sports in college can be an amazing experience. Leveraging sports to get into a college that you may not have been able to gain admission to without your sport is a huge win. Earning a reduction in the cost of getting that education can be truly life-changing. And, of course, playing the sport you love for four more years can be a lot of fun, and lead to lifetime memories and friends. Not bad. \nJust remember that every school (or coach within a given program) you’ll encounter as you pursue this journey does not have your best interest at heart. Be an educated consumer, understand the tradeoffs you’re making, and take your next step as a fully informed student-athlete.
