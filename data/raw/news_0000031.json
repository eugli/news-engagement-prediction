Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJose Mourinho has taken an incredibly obvious pop at Jurgen Klopp regarding the way they are being treated by match officials. \nThe Manchester United boss was speaking after his side's goalless home draw with Hull on Wednesday night. \nSeveral incidents in the match occurred - including two shocking challenges by Oumar Niasse - which caused Jose Mourinho to lose his cool on the touchline. \nThe Red Devils boss was told by the fourth official to sit down or risk being sent to the stands.

Jose Mourinho feels he's being treated unfairly (Photo: Julian Finney) \nSpeaking in his post-match press conference, Mourinho said: \"You know clearly that I am different. \n\"I am different, the rules for me are different. I am different in everything. I watch my team in the hotel, I was forbidden to go to the stadium. Wenger recently received a four-game ban for pushing a fourth official (Photo: Sky Sports) \nMourinho even took a thinly veiled dig at Arsene Wenger before popping at Klopp. \n\"My assistant had a six matches stadium ban, I didn't touch anyone,\" he said. \n\"Yesterday one fourth official told to a manager, 'I very much enjoy your passion, so do what you want to do.'
