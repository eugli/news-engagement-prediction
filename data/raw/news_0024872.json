The combination of eccentric guests, Cilla Black's Liverpudlian charm and a 'lorra lorra' terrible jokes made it compulsive viewing for families\nWhile those who managed to make fame stick - including Amanda Holden, Jenni Falconer and Ed Byrne - have been well documented, what happened to the more pedestrian contestants... who left the show with a 'lorra lorra' nothing at all, and certainly not love?\nHere, FEMAIL trots down memory lane and unearths a handful of the more memorable characters who found themselves sat in one of the famous daters' chairs.\nScroll down for video\nTHE UNDERCOVER JOURNALIST WHO GOT CAUGHT OUT BY CILLA\nWhen Nicola Gill, then 27, told the Blind Date team she was a secretary, she strolled through the auditions and onto the set to pick date Paul Mankelow...\nBut not much got past Cilla...and Gill - actually a journalist for Cosmopolitan - was sniffed out by the Blind Date team...and humiliated live on air\nWhen Cosmopolitan journalist Nicola Gill, then 27, was tasked with going under the radar to report on the show's inner workings, she came undone in front of a live audience.\nGill pretended she was a secretary and plucked innocent Paul Mankelow out for a date.\nHowever, when the couple regrouped with Cilla on the sofa following their rendez-vouz, the veteran entertainer revealed the show knew what exactly she was up to.\nCilla said: 'Well Nicola, I have to say I've got more than a little surprise for you. 'Cause I know what you're at and I feel awfully, deeply saddened by this. You don't work as a temporary secretary.\n'I know for a fact that you're actually an undercover journalist and you've robbed somebody of coming on a proper Blind Date. You work for Cosmopolitan magazine...\nGill, still a journalist, wrote a piece about her strange television encounter after the event and described the awkward moment Cilla revealed she knew her real job as 'TV hell'\n'It's just a shame you tried to pull the wool over our eyes... but you didn't!'\nGill wrote after the show aired in 1998: 'Paul looks stunned. I feel sick. The studio is spinning. The audience is booing. [...] All I can do is keep smiling, mumble about the fantastic time I've had and wait for this TV hell to end.\nTwenty years on and now a mum, Nicola is still plying her trade as a journalist.\nTHE GAY COUNT WHO PLAYED IT STRAIGHT\nIn 1994, flamboyant Count Roberto Luigi Michieli, then 29, wowed Cilla - and viewers with his red coat-tails, deep tan and perfectly coiffured hair.\nThe right show, the wrong sex: Aristocrat Count Roberto Luigi Michieli admitted he was actually gay after appearing on Blind Date in 1994\nStill partial to a regal coat! Count Roberto gave a twirl of his colourful tails in 1994\nThe jet-setting count from Venice still leads a charmed life according to his Facebook profile\nThe aristocrat from Venice later confirmed that he was in fact gay and continues to enjoy a privileged life living in London; his Facebook page carries his family crest and under the header: Work, are the words: 'What's that mean \"Work\"?'\nTHE MAN WHO TOOK A SOOTY PUPPET ALONG\nGeoff from Cheshire brought along a little friend...and a unique pair of trousers when he appeared looking for love in 1989\nBrummie Cheryl was left wide-eyed when she clapped eyes on Geoff's interesting atttire\nThe 'tash has gone but Carter still looks partial to a zany expression - and describes himself as a traveller and film-maker now\nWhen Cheshire's Geoff Carter arrived on screen wearing patchwork trousers and accompanied by a Sooty puppet, 1989 audiences couldn't get enough of his colourful charm. When asked what he was looking for in a woman, he said: 'Same as me with long hair.'\nNeither could Birmingham-based contestant Cheryl...although she was more than a little shocked by the watching crowd's reaction when she plumped for 'number three'.\nNearly 28 years later, Carter clearly thinks of his time on Blind Date fondly, even reappearing, this time wearing a more sober outfit, in 2013 on a celebration of Cilla Black's career, hosted by Paul O'Grady.\nHis Instagram account is littered with images from his travels in South East Asia and his Twitter bio sees him describing himself as an: 'International Traveller, film maker for youtube (Geoffcarter) Cook, Artist. Dj. and all round top banana.'\nTHE ONLY CONTESTANT EVER TO WIN A DATE TWICE\nJon Wiltshire impressed Cilla first time around with his unique leather hat - covering his billiard ball-smooth bonce - in 1996. When the celebration show aired in 2013, he was back in the chair...and won the chance of a romantic tete-a-tete again.\nJon Wiltshire (pictured in 1996) can hold claim to a unique title...being the only contestant to win a date more than once. He appeared in a show celebrating Cilla Black's career in 2013 and found himself behind the screen of love once more\nStill partial to unique headwear, Wiltshire describes himself now as a writer and lecturer\nClearly a fan of popular television shows, he also cooked up a storm on Channel 4's Come Dine With Me.\nNow working as a children's author, artist and lecturer, the quirky three-time television star also has his own YouTube channel .\nTHE WOMAN WHO SANG HER WAY THROUGH THE SHOW\nGirl can sing! Claudia Patrice became memorable for belting out lines during her appearance on the 1989 show\nPatrice kept on singing and has worked with some of the music industry's biggest names\nClaudia Patrice was determined to use her 1989 appearance to show off her pipes and sang her way through much of the show.\nShe's still singing and lists an illustrious set of names she's worked with on her website including Kylie Minogue, Chaka Khan and Jocelyn Brown.\nTHE TRENDY VICAR\nPerhaps not the first place a vicar might look for love, Simon Gatenby unsurprisingly didn't find it in a London television studio. What he did find was ex-kissogram Polly Anderton - who turned into a lasting friend.\nVicar Simon Gatenby appeared on the show hoping for romance; he found a long-term friendship with former kissagram Polly Anderton\nStill a man of god, Gatensby shared that he had chatted to his one-time date Polly when Cilla Black died in August 2015\nThe trendy man of god continues to wear the dog collar and describes himself on Twitter as a lover of; family (enthusiastically), God (doggedly), soul & funk (passionately), Bolton Wanderers (religiously), malt whiskey (experimentally) & life generally.\nWhen Cilla Black died in August 2015, he tweeted that he'd been in touch with his former date, writing: 'RIP Cilla!
