Zuzu Verk disappeared nearly 500 miles away from home, now remains found in West Texas are in Fort Worth for identification . \nToday Verk’s family could learn if the body at the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification is in fact that of the missing 22-year-old. Zuzu Renee Verk \nVerk hasn’t been seen alive since last October. The Keller native was attending college at Sul Ross State University in Alpine. Her boyfriend, Robert Fabian, was arrested over the weekend and remains behind bars. He is facing charges related to concealing a corpse. \nFabian, 26, is expected to go before a judge this morning for arraignment. His sister, Jocelin Carrillo, told the local CBS station KSOA that she doesn’t believe her brother committed a crime. \n“The only question that keeps going through my mind is if the body hasn’t been identified why was he arrested, because the body has not been identified?” she asked. “Everybody’s focusing on my brother when somebody’s out there probably sitting around saying, ‘I got away with this.’” Alpine police arrested Robert Fabian on a warrant for tampering with or fabricating physical evidence by concealing a human corpse in relation to remains found in a West Texas town. (Alpine PD) \nIt was late last week when investigators set up camp just west of Alpine, about 220 miles southeast of El Paso near the U.S.-Mexico border. It was there where a border patrol agent found a body in a shallow grave – just a few miles from Fabian’s home. \nPolice had searched Fabian’s home before the remains were found and said information gathered then and later led them to take action. Alpine Police Chief Russell Scown said, “We had evidence to begin with. We recovered more evidence at the scene, and so we felt the time was right to make that arrest.” \nInvestigators say the body had possibly been disturbed by wildlife and was unidentifiable to police. The autopsy is being performed at the UNT Health Science Center. \nThe Verk family issued a statement that said, in part – \n“As our family awaits the likely news that our worst fears have been realized, our sorrow has grown alongside a sense of relief from the constant state of not knowing. Zuzu has been a bright light in our lives. It has been our greatest challenge to go forward these last months without her joyous laugh, fierce idealism and heart-melting smile, knowing we may all never have them again. We could not have maintained our strength without the comforting embrace of our family, friends and community.” \n  redistributed.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T19:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T15:12:26.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
