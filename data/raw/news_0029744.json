Inauguration Photo Features Embarrassing Trump-Style Misspelling A challenge \"to\" great for the Trump administration: Spelling. 02/13/2017 12:34 am ET Mary Papenfuss Trends reporter, The Huffington Post Library of Congress \nFor a man known for his frequent misspellings in his bombastic tweets, what could be better than an official inauguration photo of Donald Trump featuring a guote from him with a ... misspelling. \n“No challenge is to great” gushes the caption under Trump’s photo — except for the challenge, apparently, of spelling words correctly. \nThe entire quote reads: “No dream is too big,” (got it right there), “no challenge is to [sic] great. Nothing we want for the future is beyond our reach.” Signed: “President Donald J. Trump.” \nThe photo with caption was for sale by the Library of Congress shop for $16.95, with a sales plug that it “captures the essence of Donald Trump’s campaign for the presidency of the United States.” For sure. \nThe photograph quickly sold out once the embarrassing glitch was spotted— and it was yanked off the web site Sunday by the, ahem, library . No joke: Purchasable copy of Trump's Inauguration Print, direct from the Library of Congress site. A 5th grader would've spotted this typo. pic.twitter.com/zomWsMojYV — Jules Winnfield (@paulm4749) February 12, 2017 \nIt’s not clear who was responsible for the mistake, and who missed it in proofreading. But Trump has certainly set a tone in his administration as the Misspeller-In-Chief . His tweets have been riddled with mistakes, including words like “payed,” big “shoker,” “loose” instead of lose, “big honer,” and “leightweight choker” (referring to Marco Rubio). Possibly everyone’s favorite concerned China’s “unpresidented” seizure in December of a U.S. Navy drone. (It has since been erased from Trump’s site.) RealDonaldTrump This is madness. A 7:30am Saturday escalation of diplomatic crisis w China via Twitter, w misspelling. https://t.co/p9QPZsr2yv — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 17, 2016 \nAnd that’s just the beginning of a parade of mistakes from within the administration that is possibly the best argument for funds not to be cut from the Department of Education — though the authors were probably all products of private schools. \nWhen the administration last week printed its list of terror attacks that allegedly haven’t been reported by the media , the word “attacker” was repeatedly misspelled as “attacker.” There are more typos in the White House's \"unreported terror attacks\" list than there are unreported terror attacks — Chris York (@ChrisDYork) February 7, 2017 @MerriamWebster please define 'attaker' — Laurapied (@laurapied) February 7, 2017 \nThen on Sunday, none other than the Department of Education tweeted about civil rights activist “W.E.B. DeBois,” which the rest of know is actually W.E.B. Du Bois. The department offered deepest apologies — except it also misspelled that as “ our deepest ‘apologizes .’” . @usedgov *W.E.B. Du Bois — Ryan Wyatt (@Fwiz) February 12, 2017 Thanks, Betsy DuVos. https://t.co/U1h4Q7zxqo — Elizabeth Hackett (@LizHackett) February 12, 2017 \nThe Republican Party tried to get in on the action by making up a quote from Abraham Lincoln to celebrate what would have been his 208th birthday Sunday— “And in the end, it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years” — but we have our hands full keeping up with the misspellings. His leadership brought us together; his legacy inspires us still.
