An entrance to Mojave National Preserve on Zzyzx Road near Baker, Calif. (Don Bartletti / Los Angeles Times) Associated Press \nA nonprofit group has donated more than 3,000 acres of desert land to the Mojave National Preserve. \nThe Mojave Desert Land Trust announced Wednesday that it had handed over ecologically and historically significant land to the park. The 110 parcels already are surrounded by the national preserve. They include juniper and yucca stands and a century-old homestead site. \nThe trust has an ongoing program to buy up private land that survived within the boundaries of the Mojave National Preserve, Joshua Tree National Park and Death Valley National Park. \n“Development of this private land can degrade neighboring park resources, impact public access and cause management problems for park staff,” a trust statement said. \nOver the past decade, the trust has conveyed about 23,000 acres of land to the National Park Service. \n“Our great desert parks are immeasurably enhanced” by the work, Greg Gress, regional realty chief for the National Park Service, said in a statement. “Scenic views, sensitive habit and historic resources that might otherwise be lost are now protected in perpetuity for all to appreciate and enjoy.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss \nRussia denies that intelligence agents were in contact with Trump's campaign team. 100,000 people living downstream of the Oroville Dam are now allowed to go home .
