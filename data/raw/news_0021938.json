Wong Queer Voices Senior Editor, The Huffington Post \nRapper iLoveMakonnen made waves in the music industry when he came out as gay last month, but a trio of fellow MCs say they are less than impressed by the move. \nIn a candid interview with Rolling Stone magazine , Migos had harsh words for iLoveMakonnen, suggesting that the rapper’s artistic credibility may be at stake following his decision to open up about his sexuality on Twitter. \nWhen writer Jonah Weiner said that iLoveMakonnen received support from fans after coming out, the trio ― comprised of Atlanta-based rappers Quavo, Takeoff and Offset ― responded apprehensively. \n“Damn, Makonnen!” Quavo bellows after an awkward interlude. “They supported him?” Quavo asks, raising an eyebrow. “That’s because the world is f*cked up,” says Offset. “This world is not right,” Takeoff says. “We ain’t saying it’s nothing wrong with the gays,” says Quavo. But he suggests that Makonnen’s sexuality undermines his credibility, given the fact that “he first came out talking about trapping and selling Molly, doing all that.” \nHe frowns. “That’s wack, bro.” \nIn the article , which was published Wednesday, Weiner notes that the eyebrow-raising remarks came shortly after Quavo cited “diversity” as one of the things he likes most about Atlanta. Meanwhile, the trio also spoke about their longstanding support of Sen. Bernie Sanders , even paying tribute to the former presidential hopeful in a song. The Sanders-referencing lyrics, however, were scrapped once Hillary Clinton became the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee . \nThe Huffington Post has reached out to Migos’s representative for further comment. \nFor the latest in LGBTQ entertainment, don’t miss the Queer Voices newsletter .
