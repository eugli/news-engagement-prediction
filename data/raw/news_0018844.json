Neighbouring Pakistan ranks 44th with 8.37 score. \n\"Although India has made incremental progress, the government needs to build upon the positive rhetoric of its IPR policy with the substantial legislative reforms that innovators need,\" he said. \nHirschmann said reforms can improve its reputation as a destination for doing business, foreign businesses' ability to invest in and 'Make in India', and India's own innovative industries. \n\"If Indian policymakers wish to deliver the kinds of results the Modi administration once hoped for, they can act to address issues that impact Indian innovation, such as software patentability, life sciences patents, copyright protection and enforcement, and trade secrets protection,\" Hirschmann said. \nIn a statement, US Chambers of Commerce said in addition to its anemic Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) policy, the report cited challenges with the scope of patentability for computer-implemented inventions, Section 3(D) of the Indian Patent Act and the recent High Court of Delhi decision regarding photocopying copyrighted content. \nThe report said the slight improvement in India's overall scores is largely because of a relatively strong performance on the five new indicators included in the Index and not from any actual improvements to their national IP environments. \nOn the contrary, in India, for instance, several developments have had a pronounced negative impact, it said. \nOf note is the High Court of Delhi judgment in the long-running case between some of the world's leading academic publishers (including both Oxford and Cambridge University presses as well as Taylor & Francis) and the University of Delhi and a?local photocopy shop, the report said.
