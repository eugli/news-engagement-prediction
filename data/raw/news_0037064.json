Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images \nThen, addressing Bey directly, she said, \"We all got to see another side of you that you don't always let us see, and we appreciate that. All us artists adore you. You are our light. The way that you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel is empowering, and you make them stand up for themselves. I love you. I always have. And I always will. Grammys, I appreciate it.\" \nWhen she went backstage, she broke her award in half (a la Mean Girls ) to give a piece of it to Queen B. \n\"Like I said in my speech, my Album of the Year is Lemonade . So, a piece of me did die inside, as a Beyoncé fan—not going to lie,\" Adele said. \"I was completely rooting for her, I voted for her. I felt like it was her time to win. What the f--k does she have to do to win Album of the Year?\" TAGS/ Solange Knowles , Beyoncé , 2017 Grammys , Grammys , Twitter , Top Stories Additional  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:01:36.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
