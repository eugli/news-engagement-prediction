Around one in 30 £1 coins currently in the system are believed to be fake.\nHowever, 87 per cent of Britons are unaware of the October 15 deadline to spend their current £1 coins , according to Mastercard’s survey of 2,000 people.\nThe study found that people tend to have £15 in £1 coins lying around in their home, rising to £25 among young adults aged 18 to 24.\nJust 17 per cent of respondents said they knew about the introduction of the new coin on March 28.\nThe new 12-sided coin comes into circulation on March 28 Credit: David Rose “We were shocked to discover just how few people are aware of when the current £1 coin goes out of circulation,” said Mark Barnett, president of Mastercard UK and Ireland.\nL ast month, the Treasury urged savers to check in coat pockets and sofa cushions for forgotten £1 coins. \n“We are calling on everybody – from conscientious children saving pocket money in piggy banks to families who like to hold on to their coins for a rainy day – to be ready for this change,\" chief secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said at the time. \nWe were shocked to discover just how few people are aware of when the current £1 coin goes out of circulation “You have until autumn to spend your round pounds or exchange them for the edgy new version at your bank.”\nT he new 12-sided coin, featuring a gold-coloured band around a silver plate similar to the £2 coin, will be “the most secure coin in the world” when it is introduced on 28 March, according to the Royal Mint. Thinner, lighter and larger than the current £1 coin, with a diameter around 1mm bigger than the current coin, the replacement also has milled edges, a hologram-like image and a “hidden high security feature” to thwart future counterfeiting.\nAs of March 2014, there were 1.55bn £1 coins in circulation. The Royal Mint is introducing 1.5bn of the new coin, and the current ones will cease to become legal tender in mid-October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:57:32.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
