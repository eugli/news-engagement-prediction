Some said Pakistan targeted alleged militant camps inside Afghanistan, while others said the camps were on not across the border areas. \n\nDar reportedly said yesterday that PM Nawaz Sharif empowered the Army to act against terrorists across the border after obtaining \"concrete evidence that Afghan soil had been used to launch recent acts of terrorism in the country\". The Prime Minister had authorised the Army \"to take out terrorists wherever they might be.\" \n\nThe minister was talking about last Thursday's suicide terror attack on the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar that killed 88 people. Immediately after the bombing in Sindh province, Pakistan claimed the attack was planned in militant sanctuaries in Afghanistan. \n\nThe minister reportedly also said \"it had been established beyond doubt that foreign soil had been used to orchestrate the two latest attacks - in Lahore and in Hayatabad\" in Pakistan. The country forwarded names of 76 terrorists to Afghanistan, Dar added. The Pakistan army also summoned Afghan diplomats to its headquarters, demanding action against Afghanistan-based militants involved in carrying out attacks in Pakistan, The News International reported. \n\nAt the time Dar made these statements he appeared unaware that Afghanistan had hit back against Pakistani belligerence by giving it a list of 85 Taliban and Haqqani network militants and their 32 hideouts in Pakistan. \n\nThere have been at least eight terror attacks this month, in which more than 100 people have died, PTI reported.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:44:37.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
