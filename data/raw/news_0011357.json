He [Bono] told them that he was playing with the dog by feeding it bread and then when it started eating, he took the bread away. \n\"I think this angered the dog and it bit him,\" she said, adding that she thinks that her son was innocently playing with the dog. \n'I don't know how I feel about dogs now' \n\"I was honestly shocked that he was bitten by our own dog. When I was going home I thought that he had been bitten by another dog, I was shocked that our dog did this.\" \nKubheka said the family kept the dog for security reasons, like most of their neighbours. \n\"Now I am really not sure what to do, I am considering alternatives because how will I know whether it will attack the children again. I honestly don't know how I feel about dogs right now.\" \nKubheka said she was considering contacting the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for an assessment on the dog so that she can make an informed decision. \nBono is recovering well and was chuffed that he could skip school on Tuesday.
