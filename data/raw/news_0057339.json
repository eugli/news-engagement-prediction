Beauty is something Naples-born Ambrosio, one half of the cult cool-girl label, Attico, cares a lot about. After all, it’s in her DNA: No matter how busy an Italian woman is, she will always make sure her lengths are well-groomed and her nails cleanly manicured, the 25-year-old explains. Picking up time-tested self-care secrets from her grandmother, Ambrosio admittedly spends hours at her local salon, where she gets her hair blow-dried to pin-straight perfection up to four times a week, but she shaves off time when it comes to makeup, which, she says, Italians approach in a “gentler” way than Americans. Below, Ambrosio breaks down the Italian beauty playbook with insider tips, her top Milanese addresses, and the secrets to achieving that belladonna glow.

Italian women are always on fleek [with] blow-dried hair and perfect nails. It’s something they don’t procrastinate, even on a busy day. Italians are not really used to some of the beauty hacks Americans have. Lashes and makeup in general are way more gentle.” On Beauty Icons “I grew up with Fellini movies, so Anna Magnani, Sophia Loren, and Virna Lisi are my Italian muses! And Monica Bellucci. It’s a cliché, but she embodies the Italian aesthetic.” On Glowing Skin “I never wear makeup, but I continuously put on all of the moisturizing creams I have. La Mer and Carita make my favorites. The Mediterranean diet is something that really makes you glow. You can tell by the way your skin is much brighter and clearer.” Photo: Courtesy of Gilda Ambrosio / @gildaambrosio On Perfect Hair “Three times a week you can find me at Romans Club, getting my hair blow-dried and drinking a healthy juice. I never wash it at home. That’s why it’s always so perfect. On a messy day, a bun and a red lipstick are my way to feel better.” On the Beauty Pit Stops “ Mimi Luzon has the best treats for your skin. I also really like the Four Seasons spa in Milan [for] massages.” On the Ultimate Italian Segreto “My grandma’s is the best place where I get all my [beauty] hacks. I can’t say how old she is, but she doesn’t have a single wrinkle on her face.” In This Story: Milan Fashion Week Recommended For You ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:45:09.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
