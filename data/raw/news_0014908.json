Related Tech CEOs Blast Trump Muslim Immigration, Travel Ban: ‘So Un-American It Pains Us All’ \nThe filing is the most unified stand yet by Silicon Valley against the Trump administration’s action, which is purportedly aimed at restricting the ability of terrorists to enter the U.S. (Amazon, however, was not a signatory to the brief although the the company has supported legal action against the Trump order in Washington State.) \nThe amicus brief comes after Trump’s anti-Muslim travel and immigration order was struck down Friday by a federal judge in Washington, and the appeals court denied the White House’s motion for an emergency injunction reinstating the ban earlier Sunday. \nAn open letter to Trump from several big technology firms voicing their concerns about and opposition to the ban was reportedly in the works last week. Earlier, several tech CEOs publicly blasted the Jan. 27 executive order — including Netflix chief Reed Hastings, who labeled it “un-American” — and last week employees of Google and Comcast staged protests against the ban. \nIn their amicus filing Sunday, the 97 technology firms said Trump’s Executive Order “makes it more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to recruit, hire, and retain some of the world’s best employees. It disrupts ongoing business operations. And it threatens companies’ ability to attract talent, business, and investment to the United States.” Filed Under:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:54:00.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
