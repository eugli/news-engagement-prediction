It had one great trailer, it was setting up an exciting new cinematic universe, and it was headlined by the two biggest superheroes on the planet. Unfortunately, the movie didn't live up to expectations, completely dividing fans and critics in the process. Though the blockbuster was a commercial success, it crawled to the goalpost instead of the flat out sprint it should have been. Now, it'll have the unfortunate reputation of winning some Razzies , having won quiet a few of the available categories, with a few notable exceptions. \nTaking place right before the Oscars, the diametrically opposed 2017 Golden Raspberry Awards, also known as the \"Razzies,\" celebrates the \"worst in film\" from the whole year. This year, Batman v Superman locked down a number of nominations in most of the main categories, which included Worst Picture, Worst Actor, and Worst Director, to name a few. Per The Hollywood Reporter , the results have come in and the superhero blockbuster has won four awards for Worst Supporting Actor ( Jesse Eisenberg ), Worst Screenplay, Worst Screen Combo (Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill), and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel. \nThe awards show wasn't totally against Batman v Superman , though. The Razzies got political and Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party won every other category, with the exception of Worst Supporting Actress (that went to Kristen Wiig for Zoolander 2 ). Hillary's America was crowned Worst Picture of the Year while also sweeping Worst Actor, Worst Actress, and Worst Director. The political documentary has definitely not received any sort of fanfare, currently sitting at a 4% on Rotten Tomatoes and critically loathed. \nIf any of these \"wins\" for Batman v Superman upset you, take solace in knowing that the Razzies essentially mean nothing. While you can argue the same thing about the Oscars, people at least remember what wins an Oscar. It's popular to shit on Batman v Superman , which is why it even had such a strong presence at the Razzies to begin with. \nWhile Batman v Superman was certainly not without its faults, there are elements deserving of praise in the blockbuster. It's handling of Wonder Woman, though brief, has been praised with plenty of \"woops\" whenever she's on screen, and you absolutely can't ignore the cinematography from Larry Fong. Even at it's worst (\"WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME?!\"), the film is still memorable and that at least counts for something. \nHopefully, the worst is behind the DCE as we look forward to Wonder Woman , hitting theaters on June 2, 2017, and followed by Justice League on November 17, 2017.
