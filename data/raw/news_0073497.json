Sanctuary cities, which limit their agencies and local law enforcement officials from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration laws, are facing a similar question.

Mr. Sini told Ms. Solis and other advocates at a meeting in January, “If a victim or a witness comes to us, we don’t inquire about their immigration status.” But still, some are not convinced. At the Brentwood office of Make the Road New York, an advocacy group that works with undocumented immigrants, members said that the anxiety over Mr. Trump’s policies trickling down to local policing was evident. “You see this fear that they are going to attack us, the Hispanics, because they have power from higher up, and the sheriff is cooperating,” said Luis, 41, a father of two daughters, who immigrated from El Salvador without authorization 10 years ago. He did not want his last name to be used because he is afraid for his older daughter’s safety in the high school, he said. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story That was the same school — Brentwood Ross that Kayla Cuevas and her best friend, Nisa Mickens, attended. On Sept. 13, they were killed by members of the gang MS-13, the police said, their bodies discovered by a cul-de-sac near an elementary school.

Credit Johnny Milano for The New York Times Kayla’s mother, Evelyn Rodriguez, approved of Mr. Trump’s aggressive tactics toward deporting gang members. “I believe everybody should have that American dream, coming here and working hard for your family and doing the right thing,” Ms. Rodriguez, whose parents came to New York from Puerto Rico, said in a recent interview. “I do not accept the ones that are coming over with the criminal record long as ever and doing the crimes here and killing our kids.” Police officials say that not every MS-13 member is an undocumented immigrant, but that the gang recruits heavily from a base of unaccompanied Central American minors who have recently entered the country illegally. Since Sept. 13, the police in Suffolk County have arrested more than 90 MS-13 members, with many in federal custody as officials gather evidence to charge them under organized crime law. The gang, also known as La Mara Salvatrucha, was responsible for the killings of 11 people in Suffolk County last year, the police said. It was not clear if the murders will be included in the charges. As part of Mr. Trump’s executive orders, he directed the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to expand its gang-fighting crime initiative. Even before the orders, Suffolk County had rejoined a joint gang task force with the F.B.I. and increased its own street patrols last fall. But to Ms. Rodriguez, it is not enough. “I told the Third Precinct, I want you to be pressing on this,” Ms. Rodriguez said, referring to the police precinct that covers Brentwood. “If you see three, four individuals in front of a store, I want you to roll up on them and see ID and if they don’t have ID, then you bring them in.” Even as Mr. Sini has tried to mak the police department more transparent within the community, he does so amid Suffolk County’s tangled history with Latino immigrants.

Credit Johnny Milano for The New York Times In 1986, at the height of the civil war in El Salvador, the Suffolk County Legislature declared the county a place of sanctuary for refugees fleeing conflict in Central America. But once the population grew from a couple of thousand to almost 7,000 immigrants, attitudes changed. By 1993, that resolution was reversed. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story According to census statistics through 2014, 58,426 Salvadorans live in Suffolk County, and nearly a third live in Brentwood. Including immigrants from Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic, Hispanics and Latinos represent 68 percent of the population in Brentwood. Over the years, law enforcement policies toward undocumented immigrants have hardened. In 2006, the Suffolk County sheriff, Vincent DeMarco, invited Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to station themselves permanently in the county jails. Officers would comply with the enforcement agency’s requests to hold prisoners 48 hours after their scheduled release so that their legal status in the country could be investigated.
