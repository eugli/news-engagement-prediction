I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let's do it. All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down,\" he said. \n\"I went and got it at half time from the kitchen, I had it all prepared and ready to go. It was meat and potato.\" \nSutton manager Paul Doswell was not impressed by his reserve keeper's stunt, saying fame had gone to the big man's head. \"I think Wayne has become this global superstar on the back of being 23 stone,\" Doswell said. \"I don't think it shows us in the best light.\" \nClub chairman Bruce Elliot said Shaw was a \"top man\" but added that the club would \"soon bring him back to earth.\" A UK bookmaker offered 8-1 odds if Shaw ate a pie live during the match.
