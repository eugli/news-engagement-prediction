Meanwhile, the staging company is also getting a fee (typically 1% of the sales price) from the sellers for making their home look cozy and livable to potential buyers. The pros and cons of live-in home staging \nLive-in home staging is still relatively rare. However, Matt Kelton , COO of Showhomes, which offers this expanded service, believes that buyers are drawn more to a house occupied by a real person than a nicely staged shell of a home. \n“Something about having food in the pantry … it’s hard to put my finger on it, but there’s some kind of emotional connection that happens,” he told NPR . \nHome sellers also have the satisfaction of knowing that someone is keeping an eye on their place. \nBut not everyone is gaga over the idea. For one, while it might be nice to have a place look lived-in, it’s not so nice if home buyers pop in to see the place when the home manager’s Chinese takeout containers are on the kitchen counter. \n“The most difficult part is making certain the home is perfect every time we walk out the door,” admits Mike Callahan , owner of a Showhomes franchise in Fox Valley/Naperville, in Illinois. He and his wife, Janine , are seasoned pros—they’ve been home managers since 2010 and are currently living in their 11th home. Even after all that time, they confess that keeping the house ready to show is probably the hardest thing about their job. \n“You just finished dinner, a friend calls to say they are going to a movie in 20 minutes . Normal people can just get up and leave; not so with us,” he says. “We first have to make certain all evidence of the meal is out of sight and the rest of the home is show-ready.” Just like newlyweds entering their first home, Mike Callahan carries his wife, Janine, over the threshold of every staged home they live in. Adorable!\nMike Callahan \nWoo Shin of One Two Six Design, a traditional home staging company in Santa Clara, CA, argues that live-in staging falls short because certain aesthetic elements get sacrificed for comfort. For instance, live-in home stagers might not want a delicate vase perched on a tiny side table lest it get knocked over and smashed to bits. And that throw blanket arranged just so on a couch might be grabbed for warmth as they lounge in front of the TV. \n“When we stage homes, we focus on creating a space that’s aspirational and maximizing what the space can be. This doesn’t always equate to functionality,” says Shin. Natalie Way is an associate editor at realtor.com.
