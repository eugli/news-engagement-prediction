(Christine Mai-Duc / Los Angeles Times) \nWhen Republican Sen. Janet Nguyen (D-Garden Grove) was removed from the state Senate floor Thursday after she tried to make a statement about the late Tom Hayden and his opposition to the Vietnam War, many predicted it was just a matter of time before California Republicans highlighted the incident at their convention this weekend. \nThey were quickly proven right. \nOn Friday, a lunch for party leaders, Central Valley Republican Marcelino Valdez referred in a speech to an unnamed young Vietnamese refugee girl seeking freedom, an obvious reference to Nguyen. \nBy Saturday morning, attendees were sporting hastily printed stickers that read \"I Stand with Janet Nguyen.\" The phrase was a play on the hashtag #IStandWithLiz, spawned after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was silenced by Republicans on the floor of the U.S. Senate. \nAt a luncheon headlined by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), Nguyen was introduced with a video highlighting the incident and her personal story of fleeing communist Vietnam. \n\"We have to stand strong and protect everybody's First Amendment rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom to have a different perspective. Because in the country I come from, that's not allowed,\" Nguyen told the crowd, shortly before leading them in the Pledge of Allegiance.
