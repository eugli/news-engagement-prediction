THE LEGION D'HONNEUR: A GIFT FROM NAPOLEON The Legion D’Honneur (pictured) was established in 1802 by Napoleon The Legion D’Honneur was established in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte and is the highest decoration in France, both military and civilian. In order to receive the redribboned medal, a non-French national must have served France or upheld its ideals. It has been awarded to soldiers, celebrities, novelists and journalists and Peter Mandelson joins nearly one million other recipients in the honour’s 215-year history. France, which on Tuesday gave the award to a dozen British servicemen, is in the process of awarding the medal to all British D-Day veterans. Other recent British recipients include Sir Paul McCartney (2012) and Harry Potter author JK Rowling (2009). Other non-French holders include Bob Geldof, Bono, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Barbra Streisand, Clint Eastwood and Bob Dylan. British novelists Graham Greene (1967) and Nancy Mitford (1950) also received the award. The first occasion was in 1996 when he took a loan from the then paymaster general Geoffrey Robinson to buy his Notting Hill home. He failed to declare it and the error cost him his job as trade and industry secretary. He came back as Northern Ireland secretary ten months later and lasted a year before being embroiled in a row over a passport for an Indian billionaire who wanted to give £1million to New Labour’s Millennium Dome project. He officially departed from public life six years ago to pursue a lucrative business career. He also set up a secretive consultancy called Global Counsel, whose client list includes BP. The grandee will take up an appointment as chairman of the Design Museum later this year. He has also been given a role as a Brexit adviser by London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan, who is known to harbour ambitions to lead the Labour Party. When Labour was in power, Lord Mandelson (pictured centre with Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling, right), a close supporter of Tony Blair, survived a number of scandals and was brought back into the government despite being sacked twice Britain passed the point of no return in its historic battle to cut ties with Brussels tonight as MPs backed the Brexit Bill Lord Mandelson has not always been so admired by the French government. He fell out with former president Nicolas Sarkozy, who accused him of ‘selling out’ French farmers’ interests. On Tuesday, the French embassy gave the same honour to 12 British D-Day war veterans. The French embassy could not be reached for comment last night.
