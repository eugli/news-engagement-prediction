It’s a little noise, it’s not like we are rampaging you, we're making a little noise, sometimes little movements, it can’t do that much harm. \n“Deal with it, we can’t help it.” \nThere are kids all across Australia dealing with Tourette’s every day and Trudy found a camp that supports them through the TS Association of Australia. \nFor Bailey – who hadn’t met anyone with Tourette Syndrome besides his father – the camp was an incredible experience. \n“I just feel like I fit in there,” he says. \n“I'm trying to fit into different puzzles, but at Tourette's camp is the right puzzle that I can fit my piece into. \n“The Tourette's camp can keep building, more people can add their puzzle pieces, they can all fit in… most of my Tourette's friends are going to be friends for life.” More Tourette's What is Tourette Syndrome?
