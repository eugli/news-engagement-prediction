Now, a condom SiliSponge hack has taken over our feeds, and we're left, well, pretty much speechless. Yes, we said \"condom.\" Like of the birth control, STD-prevention variety. We're not sure we've ever used the words \"makeup\" and \"condom\" in the same sentence before—actually, no, we definitely haven't—but we like to think of ourselves as adventurous. In the bedroom, in our beauty routines, and apparently in the strange Venn diagram where the two intersect. Beauty vlogger Laila Tahri was one of the lucky ones who got their hands on the original SiliSponge , which has now been sold out for months. After testing it out, she realized she still preferred the softness and flexibility of a regular makeup sponge, but wanted a similar smoothing effect from the silicone. That's what led her to this condom SiliSponge hack. She recently shared her tutorial on Instagram and YouTube, where the posts have each gotten thousands of views. \"I came up with this idea because of that I love using a sponge. But it absorbs so much product. With using the condom around it HAHA it doesn’t absorb any product and it applies super smooth,\" she captioned her Instagram video.

Before applying any makeup on the sponge, she rinses off all of the lubricant ( which can actually make a good primer if you have dry skin and absolutely nothing else to use ). Then come the eye-opening results. As she begins to apply the foundation, you can see that all of it is absorbing into her skin—not the sponge—and none of it is absorbed by the condom. She is left with full and even coverage, perfect for a photo-ready IG makeup look .
