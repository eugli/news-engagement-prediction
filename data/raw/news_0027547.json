Here’s Sheryl Crow in a long duster coat, cowboy boots, and not much else. \nAlicia Keys wore this bizarre combination of a sari and jeans to the 2002 Grammys. \nKnown for her revealing looks, Lil Kim’s satin dress left lil to the imagination. We doubt the tiny fur stole provided much warmth. \nCarrie Underwood wears mostly monochromatic gowns these days. We love the vibrant color print of this Zuhair Murad gown. \nFergie reportedly called this canary yellow Calvin Klein column dress her “glass slipper.” She looked like a princess in it. \nBeyonce looked out of this world in a futuristic, silver and blue Elie Saab gown. \nCher looked like she had gone through hell and back in this distressed, heavy gown. \nRapper M.I.A. not only walked the Grammys red carpet while she was pregnant, the awards show actually fell on her due date. She wore a flouncy dress and flats for maximum comfort. \nBackstage, M.I.A. flaunted her baby bump even more in this sheer shirt and short skirt. \nRihanna always turns it out at the Grammys, as she demonstrated in this regal high collared Elie Saab creation. \nLady Gaga looked out of this world in this custom Giorgio Armani Prive dress, complete with star accessory. \nRihanna turned heads again in this Jean Paul Gaultier gown with strategically placed bands. We can only imagine what the fitting was like! \nNicki Minaj had us seeing spots in this leopard look and sky-high hair. \nKaty Perry (and then-husband Russell Brand) looked heavenly in this custom Armani gown complete with angel wings. \nCee Lo dressed up as a giant muppet while performing with the Jim Henson creations on stage. \nFergie flaunted her lady lumps in this bright orange, laser-cut, lace Roberto Cavalli gown. \nCyndi Lauper looked like a cross between Bellatrix Lestrange and Michael Jackson. \nKaty Perry always goes the elegant route at the Grammys, exemplified by this breathtaking blue Elie Saab gown. Even her updo was color-coordinated. \nNicki Minaj made a dramatic arrival a hooded Versace robe and a faux pope as her accessory. \nJennifer Lopez had a leg up (or should we say leg out) on the wardrobe restrictions set by CBS in 2013. This body baring Anthony Vaccarello dress was simple, yet sexy. \nFlorence Welch’s style is as unique as her voice. This green, studded, reptilian dress was definitely one-of-a-kind. \nNo one could ever say Katy Perry’s style is one note, especially in this ethereal gown that looked like sheet music. \nThis white lacy Michael Costello gown put the “Project Runway” alumni on the map. Beyonce has favored this sheer look in recent years. \nWe’d be all smiles like Miranda Lambert in this custom red Pamella Roland gown. Just classic. \nMiley Cyrus showed off lots of skin in this Alexandre Vauthier creation. \nMadonna’s ornate bullfighter-inspired Givenchy get-up was very revealing from the back. Trust us on this one. \nAnother sheer orange dress, this time courtesy of Joy Villa. The Latin songstress’ modesty was only preserved by a pair of pasties. \nTaylor Swift surprised everyone is this modern, ombre blue Elie Saab gown — a total departure from her typical red carpet look. Magenta Giuseppe Zanotti shoes added another pop of color. \nRihanna saved the day in this voluminous pink Giambattista Valli dress.
