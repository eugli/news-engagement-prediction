SkyTracker Weather \nPartly to mostly cloudy skies are expected into the middle of the day, helping warm us up a degree or so into the minus teens for an afternoon high before clouds clear out later on. \nThursday-Friday \nThursday will start out under sunny skies with cooler temperatures and wind chill values pushing into the low -30s before cloud cover builds in during the day. \nA low pressure system developing in Alberta will help push in milder conditions, with the mercury rising up right through the minus teens to around -11 with a chance of snow into the evening. \nSnow is expected to move into Saskatoon late Thursday into Friday. SkyTracker Weather \nThat system will slide through on Friday, bringing with it the clouds and a good chance of snow during the day as we warm even further into minus single digits for a daytime high. \nWeekend Outlook \nSaturday will likely start out with some clouds that will then clear out during the day as temperatures rise into mid-minus single digits. \nWe get into some more sunshine for Sunday with an afternoon high around or possibly even just above the freezing mark as a moderate westerly wind kicks in. \nHere is your Saskatoon SkyTracker 7-Day Weather Forecast.
