Getting there was easy – either by cable car, monorail, ferry or, following its construction in 1992, the Sentosa Causeway. The novelty of the cable cars meant scores of lovebirds would flock to the island to take in the then-newly built attractions: among them the Sentosa Coralarium and its lookout tower, Palawan beach lagoon, the Butterfly Park, and the musical fountain that a few of you might still remember from your childhood. There was even a roller-skating complex that opened there in 1975 – and who can forget Fantasy Island in the ’90s? COUPLE TALK Saadah Khamis, 53, and Ramli Ani, 56 ‘There weren’t many places to go around Singapore back then, and Sentosa was the place to be – we’d go on double dates with our friends. Most of our dates were spent either here or in a cafeteria in Changi Airport that’s since closed down, sadly.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T15:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T10:15:42.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
