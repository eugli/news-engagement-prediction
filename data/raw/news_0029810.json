More videos Trump knew of Flynn's calls with Russia \nUS President Donald Trump knew for weeks that national security adviser Michael Flynn had misled the White House about his contacts with Russia but did not immediately force him out, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. \nNo doubt too, that Trump was \"instinctively correct\" in declaring that the real story here is the tidal wave of administration leaks that flushed former USA Army General Michael Flynn from his White House security perch. In ignoring the enmeshing​ political, legal, security and diplomatic dimensions of the first, tempestuous month of his presidency, Trump seemingly is of the view that he can shut this thing down. \nBut too many questions still need answers. And too many investigations and inquiries already are on foot with calls for more, even by Trump's Republican allies in congress, for the mess that is the triangle of Trump, Flynn and Moscow to go away any time soon. Related Content Russian lawmakers rush to the defence of General Michael Flynn \nDemands by prominent GOP senators that Flynn be hauled to the Capitol, to be grilled before a Senate investigation, signal that the whole Russia/Trump/Flynn story will get much bigger, before it gets so small that Trump might then have time to go after the leakers (bless their souls). \nSo let's do this by the numbers - six questions: Advertisement \n1. Were it not for the leaks did Trump intend to keep Flynn by his side and pretend that his indiscretion and his lies were of no account, and that his administration might soldier on with a national security adviser who has been deemed a likely target for foreign blackmailers in the country's most secret councils. \n2. If, as the White House acknowledges, Trump was advised of the circumstances and blackmail risk as far back as January 26, why did he feign ignorance when quizzed on February 10, about The Washington Post' s latest explosive report? SHARE US President Donald Trump on Tuesday. Photo: Bloomberg \n3. Flynn's reputation as a loose cannon notwithstanding, who else in the Trump transition team might have work-shopped the NSC chief's offending December phone call to the Russian ambassador? As Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told CNN: \"I find it hard to believe General Flynn would just go rogue, seems more likely someone directed him to engage the Russians.\" \n4. Spicer said that Flynn had to go because of \"the evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation…\" – which would be Flynn's call to the Russians. But he continued: \"…and a series of other questionable incidents\". What are these other career-destructive incidents? SHARE US President was \"instinctively correct\", says Sean Spicer, White House press secretary. Photo: Bloomberg \n5. Did Flynn lie only to his administration colleagues or, as reported, to the FBI as well? Will he be charged? \n6. How does Trump, the I-love-Putin candidate, navigate demands from the likes of Republican Senator John McCain that Congress codify the existing suite of US sanctions on Moscow, as a block on Trump unilaterally agreeing to Russian requests to be freed from the sanctions? SHARE Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Photo: AP \nThere's already a blizzard of overlapping investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, with three Trump associates under investigation by the FBI and other agencies for their contacts with Moscow. \nThey are former campaign chief Paul Manafort and advisers Carter Page, and Roger Stone. Now Flynn seemingly joins their ranks, prompting this tweet by former Obama adviser Ben Rhodes: \"When campaign chairman and NSA [director] both resign over Russia ties there is more - Manafort and Flynn had nothing in common except Russia and Trump.\" SHARE House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Photo: AP \nRussia's computer hacking ventures that US intelligence has concluded were intended to embarrass Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and to help Trump's campaign, is still being investigated by the security agencies and by congressional committees. \nAlso being investigate by the agencies is the so-called \"dodgy\" dossier, the work of a former senior British spy, the 35-page document makes two key points. It alleges that the Trump campaign was in collusion with Moscow, and the agencies have confirmed the veracity of some of the dossier; but they have confirmed none of its more salacious element – that Moscow holds a so-called sex tape, made during a 2015 visit by Trump to the Russian capital, with which it intends to blackmail the American president. SHARE Before working with Donald Trump, Paul Manafort worked with an ally of Vladimir Putin. Photo: Bloomberg \nThe US Army is separately investigating if Flynn, as an ex-military officer, broke the law by accepting payment from a foreign government – his fees for appearing at a Moscow event organised by Russia Today, the Kremlin-funded cable news channel. \nCalling for a full-scale investigation, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tod reporters: \"The truth and consequences of the Russia connection: the American people deserve to know the full extent of Russia's financial, personal and political grip on President Trump and what that means for our national security. \n\"Flynn's resignation is a reflection of the poor judgment of President Trump and demands answers to the grave questions over the President's involvement. By what authority did Flynn act and to whom did he report?\" \nThat's very much a \"well ,she would say that, wouldn't she?\" take on developments. More troubling for Trump will be the calls for investigations by some of his GOP colleagues in congress. \nDemanding an exhaustive investigation of Trump's ties to Russia, Missouri Senator Roy Blunt, a Republican, told a radio interviewer: \n\"I think everybody needs that investigation to happen and the Senate intelligence committee, again, that I serve on, has been given the principal responsibility to look into this. And I think that we should look into it exhaustively so that at the end of this process, nobody wonders whether there was a stone left unturned, and shouldn't reach conclusions before you have the information that you need to have to make those conclusions. \n\"What did he know? What did he do? And is there any reason to believe that anybody knew that and didn't take the kind of action they should have taken?\" \nFlynn's demise is cast as a direct hit by the US intelligence services in their war with the Trump administration. Maligned and mocked as incompetent by Trump and Flynn, many in the agencies will celebrate that they were acting competently when they eavesdropped​ on the phone call that was Flynn's undoing. \nBut over at Breitbart News the spin is different – and it's not necessarily fake news. \nClaiming to be well briefed by sources at the White House, where former Breitbart boss Stephen Bannon is Trump's chief strategist, the news site casts the Flynn flame-out as a war between GOP establishment forces and the high-octane, near anarchists led by Bannon. \nBy their logic, if the outsider Flynn had been made to fall on his sword, then so too must Trump chief of staff and former RNC chairman, Reince Priebus.
