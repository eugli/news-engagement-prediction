Let's Make a Deal! Lonzo Ball Blocked By Cybersquatter ... Let's Make a Deal! \nAnswer -- It ain't Lonzo Ball . \nTurns out, the site was snatched up by a huge basketball fan named Jeremy back in 2013 ... in the hopes the kid would blow up one day. \nNow, Jeremy's prediction has come true -- and it puts him in a very precarious position. \nObviously, Ball -- who some say could be the #1 overall pick in the NBA Draft -- would want that domain to launch his official website. \nBut don't expect Jeremy to just hand it over. We spoke to the guy who says he'd definitely be willing to part with the domain if the price is right. \nSo, what are Ball's options? He could pick a legal fight if he doesn't want to pay ransom money for the site ... but that could take way more time, energy and money than just writing a check. \nOur prediction ... Jeremy will probably get paid -- but were guessing Ball's future agent will probably be the one to foot the bill. \nAfter all that's what agents are for, right?
