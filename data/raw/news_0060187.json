But finding the right fit without the markup that many clothing brands bake into the price is tough. With Indochino Suits however, you get a made-to-measure suit built with top quality components and thoughtful construction. They take 14 measurements from you to the exact dimensions for a fit that looks and feels like it was made for you and you alone. And the fit isn't the only thing that will make your suit stand out, as Indochino offers a great selection of fabrics and customization options — from lapels to linings and more — to personalize your look. So instead of grabbing a suit off the rack or spending more for the right fit, hit up Indochino online or at one of their showrooms for the upgrade your closet desperately needs.
