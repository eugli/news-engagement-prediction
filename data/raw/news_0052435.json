Palaniswami in the Assembly. \nThe DMK on Tuesday wrote to the Tamil Nadu Assembly Secretary seeking a no-confidence motion against Speaker P. Dhanapal. \nThe move comes a day after DMK working president M.K. Stalin filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition challenging the vote on Motion of Confidence moved by Chief Minster Edappadi K. Palaniswami in the Assembly on Saturday last. \nMr. Stalinâ€™s counsel Shanmugasundaram on Tuesday alleged in the Madras High Court that the Speaker and Assembly Secretary are attempting to tamper with the records of the House proceedings of February 18. \nSenior counsel urged the First Bench of Acting Chief Justice Huluvadi G. Ramesh and Justice R. Mahadevan to urgently hear Mr. Stalin's petition, which prayed the court to declare the decision of the Speaker in accepting the vote of confidence as illegal, null and void. \nThe PIL would be heard on Wednesday. \n(With inputs from PTI )", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:34:04.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
