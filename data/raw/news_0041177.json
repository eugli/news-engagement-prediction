But luckily it doesn't affect our relationship. He's the strongest rock I could ever ask for.' But it's not just sex that makes her pass out - other triggers include not getting enough sleep, temperature, laughing, exercise and anything that causes her heart rate to increase, like watching a horror movie. Mrs Crow, who has been with Ben for eight years and married for nearly five, had been perfectly healthy up until she fell pregnant with her son Dylan in late 2009 - but out of the blue she started fainting, sometimes several times a day. After numerous tests, she was finally diagnosed with PoTS in 2011. She said: 'When I was around four weeks' pregnant, I passed out and went to the doctors. 'I'd never fainted in my life until then. 'The first doctor I saw said it was just part and parcel of pregnancy, but another doctor sent me for tests. 'I think I had had the PoTS before then, but it just took the pregnancy and the 'trauma' to my body to trigger it.' At one point, she was passing out up to seven times a day. But after having her second two children - Ralph, three, and one-year-old Faith - her symptoms started to ease. She still has to be careful to try and avoid situations that can lead to fainting - but with a husband and three young children, it's not always possible. Mrs Crow said: 'We did think twice about having more children - but at the time they didn't know if it was a hormone problem that had triggered the PoTS, so it potentially could've gone away with another pregnancy. 'It did get better - I used to pass out seven or eight times a day, but after my second and third pregnancy it's only once or twice a day. 'Laughing is also tricky - Ben is a tickler every time he tickles me I laugh myself to a faint! 'Even when playing with my children - we could be running around, joking and laughing, and the next minute I'm on the floor. 'But I'm not going to stop laughing or having sex in the name of PoTS.' Now, she generally only faints once a day, but she has to have a carer with her 24 hours a day just in case she passes out. She also struggles with other conditions linked to PoTS, including Elhers-Danlos Syndrome, inappropriate tachycardia syndrome and dis-associative seizures. Mrs Crow is now looking into applying for a support dog, which will be able to alert her when she's about to faint, so she can get some of her independence back. She said: 'Even when I don't pass out, the symptoms are debilitating in themselves - I also have to be careful about doing things which will trigger fainting, which could be anything! 'I can't be the mum I want to be - I dreamed of being a 'normal' mum who could do the school run by myself, do sensory classes with my babies without falling unconscious, who can stand on the playground every day without any assistance or pop out with the kids and get an ice cream. 'The children are amazing though - my six- and three-year-old are registered as young carers. 'Even my one-year-old will sit and stroke my hair while she waits for her dad to rush over after I've passed out. 'It breaks my heart that they almost have to look after me, but they're incredible and they know no different. 'It's tough with Ben as well - I'm the wife that can't be tickled, can't be loved, who can't let their husband out without having a carer to look after me. 'I hide so many emotions through smiles, but thanks to my amazing husband and three gorgeous children I have the strength to keep going.'
