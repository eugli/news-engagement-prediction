The video that Ben Baller shared to his Instagram shows the chain sparkling as it‚Äôs removed from its packaging. It didn‚Äôt come cheap, though, TMZ has reported that the chain cost around $100,000. \nBaller also shared some reflections on his history with Drizzy. \n‚ÄúI met @champagnepapi at the Apple Store in the Beverly center in 2008. From that day on I fucked with The Boy heavy. I was picking him up from the airport, getting him cars, trees and showing him my city like a real big homie does. #SoFarGone dropped and shit hit the fan. Then #ThankMeLater , then #TakeCare and He would take me on tour to be apart of the show giving out chains to random girls in the audience. One time at a sold out show in San Jose, Drake forgot where we were because he screamed out ‚ÄòLA what‚Äôs good???!!!!'‚Äù \n‚ÄúAnd that Bay Area crowd boo‚Äôd ?LOUD?. It felt like that southwest commercial, Wanna get away? I back stepped off that stage dumb fast ? In 2012 I started my family and he became the biggest superstar in the ? and we lost communication‚Ä¶ So 9 years later were here in Manchester U.K. to finally have our full circle moment. More life and more jewels to come bro.‚Äù A video posted by Ben Baller üá∞üá∑ (@benballer) on Feb 11, 2017 at 11:26am PST \nDrake shared some shots of him in the chain, as well as a CeeLo at the Grammys -inspired meme.
