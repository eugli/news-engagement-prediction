Article continues below \nAll of those sides have a history of spending money, and it appears as though the latter is looking to steal two of the Premier League's biggest stars this summer in a bid to truly compete in Europe. \nPSG boss Unai Emery added attacking trio Julian Draxler, Goncalo Guedes and Giovani Lo Celso to his ranks in the January transfer window, and despite an outlay of around £68 million, the Parisians remain keen to do more business in the summer. Article continues below Watch: The moment Zlatan Ibrahimovic ended Christian Fuchs' career \nAccording to Goal.com , Alexis Sanchez and Sergio Aguero are the two forwards they are targeting, and both men may have different, but equally strong motivations for the move. \nManchester City forward Aguero has recently lost his spot in the team to Brazilian wonderkid Gabriel Jesus, who has scored three goals in his first two starts. \n“Yeah, fine, normal,” Aguero said of his current situation when asked by Goal. “Sometimes this happens. When you’re on the bench you have to wait for your opportunity. I have three months to do my best and try to help the team and we’ll see what happens with my future.” \nWhile Aguero's words will encourage PSG to chase him in the summer, it's Sanchez's actions that will give the French club hopes of securing his signature. \nThe Chilean superstar was virtually anonymous against Chelsea on Saturday in a clash where Arsenal's title aspirations would either live or die. \nHe also threw a strop against Bournemouth last month after failing to beat the south coast club at home and rumours continue to circulate that he will not sign a new contract at the Emirates Stadium, forcing the club to move him on in the summer with his current deal expiring in 2018. \nPSG sporting director Patrick Kluivert has shown he is not afraid to spend the money necessary to get top players since taking on the job and has a penchant for getting deals done. \nThis summer will be a big test of his abilities, but, both players seem more than attainable right now. \nDo you think both players will seek pastures new in the summer?
