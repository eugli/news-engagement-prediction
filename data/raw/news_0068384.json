GETTY IMAGES \nIt's the kind of performance Mariah Carey might've shut down mid-song . \nREAD MORE: \nThe pop star, long criticised for her lack of vocal range, took the stage at the Grammys with Bob Marley's grandson Skip for a rendition of her anticipated comeback single Chained to the Rhythm . HOLLYSCOOP \nKaty Perry is back on the scene with the release of her music video for “Chained to the Rhythm.” And let’s just say, it’s a tad weird, but that’s typical Katy Perry. \nBut the performance, coming mere minutes after Beyonce's scene-stealing extended ode to motherhood , was panned by viewers, both for its shaky delivery and vague political jabs, with the duo ending the song in front of a projection of the US constitution. \nDespite the awkward live debut, the single – co-written by Sia and Max Martin – has quickly become a top five hit, because no one listens to vocals on the radio anyway. It also set a record on Spotify for highest first-day streaming for a single by a female artist. \nThe clip is a stark contrast to a similar mic feed leaked from Lady Gaga's performance at the Super Bowl earlier this month, which showcased the singer's powerful vocals. \nThe clip, which saw Gaga kick off a medley of her biggest hits with a mashup of God Bless America and Woody Guthrie's This Land Is Your Land – which many read as a subtle protest of Donald Trump's divisive policies – quickly went viral, racking up over a million views and praise for the singer. \n\"Can she sing? You don't say. A singer should be able to sing,\" wrote one commenter. \nWell, not necessarily, it seems. - Sydney Morning Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:04:13.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
