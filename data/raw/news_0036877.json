Setting it up is relatively simple: You take out your current light bulb, screw the LampChamp into your lamp, and screw your bulb into the LampChamp. Any standard-sized bulb will work, and if your bulb doesn't fit, Olens Technology (the creators of the LampChamp) will send you an adapter. \nIt doesn't have as many ports as other USB hubs I've recommended, but the two it does have should be sufficient if you use the LampChamp with a lamp you have next to your bed. It eliminates the problem of having to choose whether to charge your phone, use your lamp, or buy a surge protector . \nI've been faced with this choice dozens of times and I've always chosen my phone over light. \nThis tech accessory is mostly about convenience; apartment dwellers like myself often have to find creative ways to keep all of our devices charged without stringing cables everywhere. At 2-amps, the USB ports on the LampChamp might actually charge your phone more quickly than the adapter that comes with your phone, which is a nice bonus. Best of all, this doesn't interrupt your use of your lamp. \nIf outlets are at a premium where you live, but lamps are plenty, it's well worth checking the LampChamp out â€” those of us with overhead lighting will have to come up with our own solution. \nLampChamp USB Light Socket Charger (2-Pack), $29.99, available at Amazon Disclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
