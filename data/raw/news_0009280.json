It appears that the Brooklyn duo is about to take another right turn. They have announced a new project called Renaissance and released its first track, \"Gotham Nights.\" \nProduced by Joshua Heflinger, \"Gotham Nights\" is a nostalgic tribute to '90s New York City rap. The Underachievers offer a humble prayer that a higher power will keep them \"segregated from haters.\" \nListen to the song while in a car, or while on a subway train trundling over the Williamsburg Bridge at dusk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T17:05:37.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
