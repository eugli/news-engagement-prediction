I use my iPad Pro a lot , and actually bought this stand when I was using my iPad Air 2 last summer. \nUnlike most stands, which are fixed in one way or another, you can adjust the angle of this stand to better suit your posture and preferred viewing angle. This is great if you find yourself using the stand in different parts of your house, where table and chair height can differ. \nThe main reason I love this stand is that it's small enough to fit in a pocket or purse. I've used it on an airplane's tray table before, and setting it up at the perfect angle took all of 10 seconds. Then, when I was done typing, I folded the stand and slipped it into my backpack. \nI've used a number of different stands in the past, some of which have better designs or are made of nicer materials, but it's this TechMatte stand that I keep coming back to. \nWhile I've primarily used this stand with an iPad, it's small enough that it won't look silly if you slip your iPhone into it on a plane ride to watch a movie. When paired with an Anker keyboard, TechMatte's stand is an iPad writer's dream â€” I'm writing this column using this method right now. \nIf you're looking for an inexpensive stand with a small profile and adjustable viewing angles, then it doesn't get as simple or useful as this. TechMatte's stand may not reinvent the wheel, but it's a really good wheel. \nTechMatte Stand, $8.99, available at Amazon \nThis article was originally published on 8/5/16 Disclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
