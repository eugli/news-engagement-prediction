Continue for updates. Report: Braves Nearing Deal For Phillips Saturday, Feb. 11 Per Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports, the Atlanta Braves are \"close\" to getting Phillips from the Reds. Rosenthal also noted the Braves are interested in Phillips because Sean Rodriguez will undergo surgery on his left shoulder and is expected to miss three to five months. Rosenthal also reported the Reds' potential return in a trade involving Phillips \"will be minimal\" because the team just wants to clear space on the infield. The Braves signed Rodriguez to a two-year deal in November. He was expected to be their starting second baseman when the season began after posting career highs in average (.270), on-base percentage (.349) and slugging percentage (.510) in 140 games with the Pittsburgh Pirates last season. On January 30, per ESPN.com , Rodriguez, his wife and their two children were T-boned by a stolen police cruiser in Miami. Rodriguez's wife and two kids were hospitalized as a result of the accident. Phillips has seemingly been a constant presence on the trade block since at least 2015 . Rosenthal reported the former All-Star even blocked a trade to the Braves earlier this offseason, but now he appears to have had a change of heart. Adding Phillips would make sense for the Braves, who will need a primary second baseman with Rodriguez's status for this season uncertain. Phillips is only signed through 2017, so the rebuilding Braves aren't making a long-term financial commitment to a 35-year-old player in the twilight of his career.
