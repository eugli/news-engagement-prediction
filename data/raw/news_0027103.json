How would resolving Kashmir stop the Taliban, who are aimed at creating their old Islamic order in Afghanistan,\" former Pakistani ambassador to the US Husain Haqqani told a Washington audience on Friday. \n\n\"So sometimes ... making this a hyper nationalistic argument on the side of Pakistan and a very simplistic (one) that we have no choice in Pakistan's approach in America ... We want both sides to actually rethink their positions,\" he said. \n\nHe said this during a discussion on a report, released by nearly a dozen top American thinktanks, that urges the Trump administration for a tougher line against Pakistan, involving both pragmatic engagement and consequences for uncooperative behaviour. \n\n'A New US Approach to Pakistan: Enforcing Aid Conditions without Cutting Ties'- co-authored by Lis Curtis of The Heritage Foundation and Haqqani of the Hudson Institute- stops short of recommending declaring Pakistan a 'state sponsor of terrorism'. \n\nAuthored by a group of eminent US-based Pakistan experts, it calls for a sharper, clear-eyed US policy approach towards Pakistan. \n\n\"Pakistan needs to do a little introspection that can we continue this for ever and ever and still have credibility,\" Haqqani said about Islamabad's continued support to terrorist activities against its neighbours. \n\nDuring the discussion, Haqqani was joined by Curtis and Christine Fair, a Georgetown University scholar and South Asia expert. \n\nFair, in her intervention, said Pakistan was \"obsessed with trying to illegally occupy\" other's territory. \n\nThe discussion witnessed acrimonious scenes when a group of pro-Pakistani people, including officials from the Pakistan embassy here and journalists, tried to disrupt the event. \n\nOne of the individuals was forced to leave the venue, as he repeatedly tried to disrupt the proceedings. While leaving, the individual accused Haqqani of being a \"RAW agent.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:45:18.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
