A case was registered based on the youth's complaint at the local police station. \n\nAccording to the youth, Rohit Kumar who works as a customer care executive with a private company in south Delhi, the incident happened on February 6 when he had gone to the ATM to withdraw cash for his daily expenditures. \n\nHe said that the notes had Rs 2000 printed in the same font as the original currency that was issued under the name of \"Children's Government\". It also had \"Churan Patti\" written in place of the watermark. The notes even bore a pledge which said \"I promise to pay the bearer a slip of Rs 2000\". \n\nSenior police officers say that when the policeman probing the case tried to withdraw cash from the ATM, he too got similar bills, following which an FIR was registered under sections of forgery and cheating. \n\nPolice have also contacted the bank authorities and have initiated an inquiry into the incident.
