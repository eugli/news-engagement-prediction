Thank you for all you have done for everyone around you, and all the creatures on this blue planet we call home. Jonah Bryson, left, and \"Toronto filmmaker Sharkman\" Rob Stewart, last year. Stewart died a few weeks ago while diving off the Florida Keys. ( Jonah Bryson photo ) By Jonah Bryson Mon., Feb. 13, 2017 My dear friend and mentor, Rob Stewart, lived his life educating the public using the power of film, showing people why we must live in balance with nature, and inspiring them to be the change they wished to see in the world. One of the millions the Toronto filmmaker has touched with his message, is me — an introvert who cares deeply about the future of the planet, and who quite frankly is more comfortable around fish than kids his own age, which is now 17. I remember seeing Sharkwater for the first time, and dreaming of the idea of working with Rob. And sure enough, impossible dreams do come true sometimes. In 2013 I reached out endlessly, left and right and up and down, to any place that had anything to do with him. I called, wrote letters, sent emails, begging to meet with Rob. And soon after, he emailed me back. In his own words, I “hunted him down.” I couldn’t believe it actually worked. I was a nobody; a kid with a dream but no resume, and Rob Stewart — my hero — said I could come up to his Muskoka cottage and help him with a movie. It was one of the best few days of my life. My mom and I had dinner with him, and I was so excited to meet him in such personal environment that I could barely talk. But something made sense between the two of us. Rob and I, from the very beginning up until the last time I saw him, had funny moments where we didn’t talk, but awkwardly made eye contact and laughed, and he’d often hug me afterwards. The bond was strong and mutual. He apparently saw a lot of his young self in me and that’s why he loved working together. But for me, I was inspired to an unimaginable degree by his message and stunning work, and that’s why I loved working with him. Article Continued Below The first night I stayed at his cottage, I remember the fire alarm wouldn’t stop beeping. So he jumped up on the railing, punched it off the ceiling, and it fell straight to the first floor. The problem was fixed. We could all go to bed. I thought: ‘WOW! He really IS a ninja like in the movies!’ That was the real Rob Stewart. If there was a problem anywhere, he would go out to solve it in his own, unique way. In the morning, I got to start collaborating with him. We headed out, filmed together, and before I knew it, I co-directed the movie with him. He gave me the opportunity of a lifetime. This was a true bucket list item for me checked off. Together, we made The Fight For Bala , which we released in the summer of 2015. Rob supported me far beyond what I could have ever asked for. He always called me something like “Dynamo Kid.” Rob taught me the basics of filmmaking when I started out; how to structure a film, why every good film needs a villain, etc. He spent time on Skype showing me his techniques and style. He tried sneaking me in at parties to meet other successful industry leaders. He’d text me asking if I was around when he was so that we could talk about our projects and about life. He invited me to film premieres. And whenever I had a question or an idea, he’d make himself available, he would listen, and help as much as he could. I am thankful for him not only for helping me become the filmmaker I am today, but for vigorously fighting for the future of the planet my generation will inherit. His life was taken far too early — two weeks ago at the age of 37 diving in the Florida Keys — but he lived it to the fullest, aware of the risks, with one goal in mind: to make the world a better place. And he succeeded. “Operation Find Darth Vader”— that was the subject of the last email I got from Rob, on Oct. 19, 2016. He wanted me to find a corporation (AKA “Darth Vader”) that was contributing to the extinction of sharks, so we could hunt it down, and go film its illegal practices together to show the world what was happening. I really hoped we could’ve done that together. Rob is only beginning his journey of inspiring the world to save the sharks, the oceans, and humanity. Though he is gone, his films will thankfully live on forever, and continue to make a change. It’s up to us now, to navigate the ship and continue his legacy. Rob: I love you. I will miss you forever. I hope to make you proud as I apply all the important lessons you’ve taught me, to my life and my work. You are such a dear, dear friend. Thank you for all you have done for everyone around you, and all the creatures on this blue planet we call home. The world is truly a better place because of you. Let all the tears we individually shed, come together as one big ocean of love, and remind us that we must, in honour of Rob, keep marching forward with optimism. Rest In Peace, Sharkman. — Your friend Jonah Bryson Jonah Bryson is a young Toronto filmmaker and musician with a passion for entertainment to make the world a better place.
