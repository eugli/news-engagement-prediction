BuzzFeed reports that the video of Clinton, who has largely steered clear of politics since the campaign, was met with cheers from the room. \n“Nearly 66 million votes are fueling grassroots energy and activism,\" she said, a reference to the number of votes she received in the 2016 election. \"And everywhere, people are marching, protesting, tweeting, speaking out, and working for an America that’s hopeful, inclusive, and big-hearted.\" \nOn Saturday, Democrats will elect a new national committee chair. The two leading candidates are former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who was under consideration to be Clinton's running mate, and Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, who endorsed Bernie Sanders in the primary. The race has been seen by some as a proxy battle between the establishment wing of the party and the grassroots; Clinton, however, didn't make an endorsement in the DNC race. Source: The Democrats on YouTube \nAlthough Clinton didn't mention Trump by name, she spoke approvingly of those who've protested the president since he took office, and suggested that some people who are protesters today could be leaders of the Democratic Party tomorrow. \n\"From the Women's March to airports, where communities are welcoming immigrants, refugees and people of every faith, to town hall meetings, where people are speaking up for health care, the environment, good jobs and all the other issues that deserve our passionate support,” Clinton said of the recent protests against President Trump and Republicans in Congress. \"Among those millions making their voices heard are future mayors, city and state officials, governors, members of Congress, even future presidents.\" \nAlthough there were no bombshells or huge surprises in the video, Clinton still indicate that she still believes the Democratic Party is the best vehicle to advance progressive change in the country, a belief that isn't quite universal amongst the American left right now. Additionally, she suggested that she will continue to play a role in strengthening the party, although the specific capacity in which she plans to do this remains unclear. \n\"Let resistance plus persistence equal progress for our party and our country,\" Clinton said at the end, a clear shout-out to the \"resistance\" moniker many Trump opponents have embraced since the election. \"As long as we stand together, and work together, with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions and love for our country, our best days are ahead. So keep fighting, and keep the faith — and I'll be right there with you, ever step of the way.\" Must Reads ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:48:39.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
