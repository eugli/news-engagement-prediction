If he doesn't turn up, we will turn to other legal provisions to compel his presence,\" he said. \nWhen asked if the suspects had been given an antidote for being exposed to the nerve agent, Comm Abdul Samah said there were discussions with the hospital to run some tests. \nJong-nam was at KLIA2 at 8am on Feb 13 to board a flight to Macau when two women suddenly appeared before him and wiped his face with the palms of their hands which contained a poisonous liquid. \nJong-nam sought help at a customer service counter at the airport and was rushed to the Putrajaya Hospital but died on the way. \nHe had come to Malaysia on Feb 6 and carried a passport bearing the name Kim Chol. \nThe police had arrested two women - one bearing an Indonesian passport and the other a Vietnamese passport - and two men, one a Malaysian and the other a North Korean, following the murder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:58:57.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
