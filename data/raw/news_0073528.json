The film introduces “Star Wars” fans to a lot of new characters, but that’s not how they always looked. \n“ The Art of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story ” goes behind-the-scenes with beautiful illustrations showing off the expanded “Star Wars” universe in great detail. \nThe 256-page is a perfect companion for any fan who’s seeing the movie. Not only is it filled with tons of concept art showcasing the development of locations and characters from Jyn Erso to the many, many designs that imperial droid K-2SO underwent, but there is also a great deal of commentary from the artists and costume designer who worked on the film. \nAbrams Books shared several pieces of concept designs from artist and co-costume designer Glyn Dillon with INSIDER from the newly-released book. Keep reading to see some of the early designs for character looks in the movie. Among the designs for Director Krennic are ones with various hats. This one appears to show him a little roughed up.

Disney Originally, the story wasn't supposed to be framed so heavily around the Rogue One leader, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones).

Used Under Authorization Two designs for Jyn's 'concho.' \n'Felicity (Jones) wanted Jyn to have an Eastern influence -- which is appropriate for 'Star Wars,' with so many Japanese influences,' said co-costume designer David Crossman in 'The Art of Rogue One.' 'The mountain mission on Eadu was going to be a completely wet, freezing cold environment, so we tried to combine some Eastern looks with a poncho, and we ended up with this thing that we called the 'concho,' because it's a crossover coat mixed with a batwing poncho.' Rebel extremist leader Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) had a lot of different looks.

Multiple designs were made for how his eyes should appear. Here's one of them. The Art of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story by Josh Kushins, and Lucasfilm Ltd. © Abrams Books, 2016 (C) 2016 Lucasfilm Ltd.

Different. 'Star Wars' can't be a reality show!' says Yen in the behind-the-scenes book. 'There were debates and discussions, but I said that seeing a Chinese character with blue eyes would be so spectacular. A Caucasian or a European -- not a big deal. But for a Chinese character, that is so fresh.' This version of his buddy Baze (Jiang Wen) shows him with slightly shorter hair and a fuller beard.

The partial armour, the boiler suit, the cool gun, the backpack,' said David Crossman. 'It was really driven by what we thought audiences would like -- what you'd want to see in a mercenary character like this. (Director) Gareth (Edwards) really responded well to the red, so we put some red in Chirrut as well.' Here's the duo in the final film.
