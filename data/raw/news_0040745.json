TOURING BIKE & ALL POSSESSIONS STOLEN #Kingston on Thames, Friday night. Blue Kona Rove + 4 bags, cam, comp, clothes. Pls help & RT pic.twitter.com/46aDhU4L8T — Rob Lutter (@robertlutter) February 11, 2017 \nBut on Friday, his Kona Rove bike, together with £8,000- worth of equipment including his laptop and camera, were stolen from outside a Co-op shop in Kingston, after he briefly left it unlocked while popping inside to get a snack. \n“I’d had some road rage problems in Kuala Lumpur and got chased through the city,” he said. “But nothing bad had really happened until I got back to England, which made me a bit depressed about England.” \nIn Kazakhstan, he had been forced to leave his bike under a train tunnel in the desert for a while so that he could go to a farm and ask for water and directions. He was helped by the people he found there and managed to get a lift back to the bike which was still there. Rob with his bike bags on tour \n“I thought that I might get robbed,” he said, “but people didn’t want anything from me.” \nPolice have said they are investigating the theft of the bike, but, not having backed-up his laptop, Mr Lutter lost thousands of images that he had collected over four years and about 60 per cent of the book he had been writing about the trip, which he had received funding for on Kickstarter . Rob was trying to raise £10,000 for charities on the ride \nMr Lutter had also been trying to raise £10,000 for charities, including Mind, on his journey through 30 countries, which took him through Europe, Asia, Australia and America. \n“I don’t take photos for myself,” he said, “I just wanted to share the journey. But I lost all those faces that I met in the Himalayas.” The travel bucket list: 25 things to do before you die \nHe is currently walking to Cambridge, having been given a new backpack, where he is due to house-sit. \n“I’m just going to have to start the book again. You can dwell on these things or just speed it up and get over it by going on a hike. \n“It’s a shame but I still have the memories of it all.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T14:27:09.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
