Karanvir and Priya seem to have aced the looks. (Munna S) \nKaranvir said in a press statement, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tribute to Sonia and Rajiv Ji‚Äôs love story, but it‚Äôs is fiction. Neither does it have any political agenda nor is it an attempt to grab eyeballs. It is a simple story which is made to create a different content for audience.‚Äù \n‚ÄúIt is a tribute to love & peace worldwide. I am an actor and my job is to act but sometimes you come across a idea and you don‚Äôt want to wait for someone to back it. This is one such product, may be few year ago it would have been difficult to take such step. But now, thanks to the growing reach of internet, it is easy to showcase one‚Äôs creativity so I took this step. I‚Äôve always been fascinated with classic love stories of the 50‚Äôs and the 60‚Äôs. They don‚Äôt white such stories or make such movies anymore,‚Äù he added. Read more Divyanka Tripathi and Vivek Dahiya celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day in Goa. See pics and videos \nElaborating on what made him go for an old love story, Karanvir said, ‚ÄúI happened to watch Rendezvous with Simi Garewal with late Mr Rajiv Gandhi. I was so mesmerized by the way he spoke and the way he carried himself - with such elegance. The way he spoke about Sonia Gandhi ji, the way they met and how he geared up the courage to ask permission to his mother, it was all mesmerizing. And that‚Äôs where my film ends. They call it the Eric Segal love story of India. It‚Äôs my tribute to him and to all the people in love. A reaffirmation that true love exists.‚Äù Me too....I'm giving a @TEDTalks on the 25th of Feb for #topiwalamedicalcollege hope you can see it online üòä https://t.co/lQUSiMZkuJ ‚Äî Karanvir Bohra (@RealKVB) February 16, 2017 \nPriya Banerjee, who was last seen in Jazbaa, said, ‚ÄúIt was very sudden & pleasant for me, when Karanvir came and asked me to be part, I could not refuse.
