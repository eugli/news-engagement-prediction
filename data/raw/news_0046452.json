WRESTLEMANIA PLANS \nHowever, the situation has left the WWE’s creative team wondering which direction they could go in as April 2 edges closer. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Article continues below \nHowever, recent rumours suggest that Joe will be part of a stable featuring The Game and Kevin Owens, while Shane is set to battle AJ Styles. \nInstead, WWE could be looking to Finn Balor as Rollins’ potential replacement, per The Inquisitr. THE GAME VS. THE DEMON? \nRing Side News reported that Balor is scheduled for some Raw house shows in March, but doesn’t have any WrestleMania plans if Rollins does make it back in time to face off against Triple H. \nIt’s definitely a great option, as fans have wanted to see the demon entrance on a massive stage, and it doesn’t get bigger than WrestleMania. \nStoryline-wise, it’s tough but the WWE can make it work considering Balor is technically one of Triple H’s NXT guys – and he also had a bitter rivalry with Samoa Joe for the NXT Championship. \nTechnically, Balor should return and target Rollins once more, but now that he’s also a face it doesn’t seem as if WWE will revisit that anytime soon. \nTriple H is a safe worker so whether it’s Balor or Rollins, they’ll be in good hands when it comes down to business. \nIf Rollins does make it back, though, and Balor is also cleared to return then the WWE have another perfect match between the demon and Joe. \nWould you like to see Finn Balor or Seth Rollins face Triple H at WrestleMania 33?
