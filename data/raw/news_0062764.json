Perhaps boosting bitcoin activity, too, is the prospect of bitcoin exchange-traded fund creation and bitcoin storage providers. \nIn the past, bitcoin rallies have frequently been seen as signs that investors are turning away from conventional assets, and hunting for places to stash their money. But as bitcoin has developed more \"mainstream\" business uses, Maley argued, it has become more correlated with equities. \nA look at bitcoin's performance relative to the S&P 500 's over the last five years does not show any particularly close mathematical relationship between the two. \nNobel laureate and economist Joseph Stiglitz said in January at the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, that the United States moving toward digital currency would have meaningful benefits like curbing corruption and increasing transparency in global financial markets, two themes from this most recent meeting. \n\"There are important issues of privacy, cybersecurity, but it would certainly have big advantages,\" he said. \nBitcoin is not fiat currency, with no backing from a government that issues it, and the space is volatile given its lack of regulation. This month alone, bitcoin has risen 25 percent after dipping nearly 5 percent in January. It has climbed nearly 22,000 percent in five years while the dollar is up 28 percent in the same time period. \n\"The big fear around bitcoin is just one day when the governments come out and say, 'We're no longer going to allow this,' and we're going to shut it down. But in a world of Armageddon, where the world ends, currencies will go by the way of the countries; bitcoin, like gold, will still have value because of the blockchain-ing that goes on behind it,\" Dennis Davitt, portfolio manager at Harvest Volatility Management, said Wednesday on \"Trading Nation.\" \nThe digital currency has a ways to go before becoming a full-on \"mainstream\" currency, but it's very much a real system of payment, Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, told CNBC on Wednesday. Given bitcoin's volatility, every time investors buy the currency at new highs, \"you kind of want to hold your nose,\" Colas said, given its volatile nature and all the hills and valleys that come along with it. \nMt. Gox, a Tokyo-based digital currency exchange, went bankrupt in 2014 after substantial losses in the bitcoin space, sending the value of bitcoin tanking. \n— CNBC's Alex Rosenberg contributed reporting.
