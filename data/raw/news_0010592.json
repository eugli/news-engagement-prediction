Ano bang pagkakaiba nila sa Abu Sayyaf? The Abu Sayyaf kidnap people and they get money. The NPA will threaten those businessmen and also get money,\" said Lorenzano. \n\"There's no difference at all,\" he added. \nDuterte on Sunday said tagged the Communist Party of the Philippines, New People's Army, and National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) as terrorist groups after suspending peace talks. \n\"From now on I will consider the CPP-NPA-NDF a terrorist group,\" Duterte said. \nDuterte has since urged communist leaders involved in peace talks to return to the country and surrender themselves. \nShare ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:42:55.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
