Car buyers can now borrow up to 70 per cent of the purchase price – up from 60 per cent – for cars with an open market value (OMV) of S$20,000 or less. Buyers of cars with OMVs of more than S$20,000 can now borrow up to 60 per cent of the purchase price, up from 50 per cent. The loan tenure was also raised from five to seven years. \nFEWER DELINQUENT DEBTORS \nDespite the heavier debt commitment, the CBS study found there was a decline in the number of delinquent debtors. Just 1.3 per cent of car loan holders had instalments overdue by more than 30 days in December 2016 - the lowest since January 2015 - compared to 2 per cent in December 2015. This compares to the record delinquency rate of 3.82 per cent in 2012, just before the MAS curbs were introduced. \nCBS executive director William Lim said the \"healthy equilibrium\" between growing balances and low delinquency rates was a result of banks offering \"responsible loans\" and consumers being more financially prudent amid a sluggish economy. \nHe added that the fall in delinquency rates cut across all age groups, even for younger motorists aged 21 to 29 years old. \nMotorists aged 50 and above, however, made up the largest group of new motor vehicle loan holders. Four in 10 motorists who took up a loan in 2016 were at least 50 years old, with the next largest segments being those in their 40s (32.4 per cent) and 30s (27 per cent). Consumers in their 20s formed only 4.9 per cent of new loan holders. \nMr Lim said the bureau expects the situation of rising loan balances and stable delinquency to continue, \"barring any economic distress\". \nThe study was based on data for 244,488 car loan holders who took loans from member banks of CBS: Bank of East Asia, Citibank, DBS, HL Bank, Hong Leong Finance, HSBC, Maybank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), OCBC, SIF, Singapura Finance, StanChart and UOB. - CNA/mz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:16:08.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
