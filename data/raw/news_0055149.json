Check out excerpts from Domain's live auction coverage. Investor nabs tightly-held Rozelle cottage at auction A Marrickville home held by the same family for more than 90 years sold for $1.77 million above reserve on Saturday, as developers battled for the prized piece of real estate. \nFlanked by apartments, the original-condition, Victorian-style home at 5 George Street was one of about 950 home scheduled to go under the hammer on what was Sydney’s busiest February auction day on record. \nA crowd of 80 braved the wet weather to watch as five of the 19 registered bidders, all with plans to redevelop the 860-square-metre block, competed for the deceased estate. \nAuctioneer Jesse Davidson of AuctionWorks at the auction of 5 George Street, Marrickville. Photo: Fiona Morris \nUnwilling to take an opening offer of $1.8 million, auctioneer Jessie Davidson of AuctionWorks called for proceedings to start at $2 million, before accepting a bid of $1.9 million. \nThat bid went unanswered for almost a minute before a rival piped up and two parties traded $100,000 and $200,000 bids, until it reached $2.45 million. \nAt $2.7 million and $3 million, two other bidders joined in, with the eventual winning bidder later joining the fray at $3.35 million. \nThe 860-square-metre property is flanked by apartment blocks. While it doesn’t have any existing development applications, the area zoned for redevelopment.

Selling agent Michael Marano of Oxford Agency said the $2.1 million reserve was was set by the NSW Trustee and Guardian based on an independent evaluation. \n“We’d had a price guide of $2.5 million,” Mr Marano told Domain after the auction. “I was confident it would sell for $2.5 million to $2.8 million, but there was no way I imagined that it was going to go over by so much.” \n“Marrickville is going from strength to strength,” he added. “The market here has been very strong and stock has been a little low.” \nUnsuccessful bidders Chris Zafeirakopoulos and Joseph Metlej.

It sold for $1.2 million above the reserve price. \nBidding for 34-36 Macpherson Street started at $4.4 million, with bidding going up in $100,000 increments, before dropping down to $50,000 increments after reaching $5.2 million. \nIt was after that point, that the eventual buyer – a local investor – joined in the bidding. He secured the property with a winning bid of $6.2 million. \nThe vendors, who bought the property more than 30 years ago for $136,000, were ecstatic with the result, according to selling agent Edward Brown of Belle Property Bondi Junction . \n“It was an incredible result, that show that there is really strong demand for good quality investment opportunities and prime real estate.” Other results from the day: \nNorth", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:43:57.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
