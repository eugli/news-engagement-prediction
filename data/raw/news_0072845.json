Jeremy Kleiner thanked fellow producer Brad Pitt who “continues to inspire us with his curiosity and his desire for good work”. 'And the Oscar will go to' … who shall win the 2017 Academy Awards, and why Read more \nThe film also won best director for Barry Jenkins, best cinematography, best editing, the Robert Altman award and the prize for best screenplay for Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney, whose semi-autobiographical play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue was the inspiration for the project. \n“There are a lot of people who pushed that script away from their desks,” a tearful McCraney said. He went on to thank those who made the decision to sign onto the film without worrying about the potentially damaging effect a gay film would have on their careers. \nOscar nominee Isabelle Huppert won best female lead for her role in darkly comic thriller Elle, winning out over Natalie Portman and Annette Bening. “I think good cinema is always independent,” she said. “I want to thank [Elle director] Paul Verhoeven for being so independent.” The team behind Manchester by the Sea: producer Matt Damon, writer/director Kenneth Lonergan and award-winning star Casey Affleck.

At the end of his speech he made reference to Trump’s government, saying: “The policies of this administration are abhorrent and they will not last. They’re really un-American.” \nHell or High Water’s Ben Foster beat out category favorite, and Oscar nominee, Lucas Hedges for best supporting male for his role in the heist thriller while an excitable Molly Shannon picked up best supporting female for playing a mother dealing with terminal cancer in comedy drama Other People. \nThe award for best documentary was won by O.J.: Made in America, the critically acclaimed seven-hour film that’s also the favorite to win the same award at tomorrow’s Oscars. Another Oscar front-runner, German comedy Toni Erdmann picked up best international film. “I’m really happy and proud to stand here as a female director because it’s still not normal enough that women are directing films,” director Maren Ade said. The acclaimed film was recently picked up for a Hollywood remake, set to star Jack Nicholson and Kristen Wiig. \nPeriod horror tale The Witch was awarded best first feature while writer-director Robert Eggers picked up best first screenplay. He thanked “all the Puritans” for writing so much of their lives down, making his job easier. Hosts John Mulaney and Nick Kroll.

He then claimed that, using the same eight year forgiveness logic, Steve Bannon will be featuring at the Oscars in 2024. \nHis comedy partner John Mulaney made the first political reference of the night, referring to the downbeat nominees: “These films are, to quote the president ‘sad!’” \nThe hosts also predicted that speeches throughout the night were likely to include more Trump jabs. But given the small scale of the ceremony, Kroll joked: “In terms of impact, you could give your speech direct to camera or you could whisper it in the bathroom.” Why Moonlight should win the best picture Oscar Read more \nMulaney added: “Hey Trump, you and Robert Durst are both rich sociopaths from New York real estate empires but somehow Robert Durst is more likable” \nThe awards arrive on the eve of this year’s Oscars where Moonlight is one of the front-runners with eight nominations alongside La La Land and Manchester by the Sea. \nBest feature ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:33:25.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
