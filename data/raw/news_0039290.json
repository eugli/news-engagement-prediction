It is required for everything from using a laptop to dealing with the bank or buying items online.\nWe seek advice on how to create codes that fraudsters should not be able to crack.\nWe must remember a mind-boggling array of passwords and PINs to survive the technological challenges of the 21st Century.\nAccording to credit-checking agency Experian most of us use at least two dozen of these online codes on a daily basis.\nThey are required not just for regular tasks, such as getting in to a computer, paying a utility bill and online shopping. But they are also necessary for using mobile phones, chatting on social media, club memberships and watching online TV.\nIt is not surprising a majority of us struggle to juggle different passwords in our head. Indeed, a quarter of us forget at least one login detail every day. This means we often adopt easy-to-remember ‘weak’ passwords that use familiar names such as a beloved pet or a family member.\nSecurity experts believe this is a dangerous strategy and a relatively easy one for criminals to crack. It is suggested ‘strong’ passwords of up to a dozen characters randomly chosen – letters, numbers and even symbols – offer much better security.\nThree-quarters of us also use the same password for more than one account. But to stop fraudsters getting hold of your details it is recommended each service you use has its own password.\nThere are ways you can create and remember secure passwords – in imaginative ways that will not leave you worried or with a headache.\n'Be random': Pickpocket entertainer James Freedman helps to advise police\n1. STOP PEOPLE READING YOUR MIND\nThe average password is not as safe as you might imagine with a third of us using something personal, such as a date of birth, maiden name, address, pet’s name or close member of the family. This means a criminal could quickly unlock your secret passwords.\nMagician and mentalist Katherine Mills says: ‘I like to get inside people’s heads, using a combination of psychology and sociology to read their mind. Using tricks of the trade you would be surprised at how easy it is to crack a password and that is why it is vital you only use a random code.’\nThe magician, who has her own TV show Katherine Mills: Mind Games on cable channel W, is not keen to divulge how she can crack codes. But she admits there are ways passwords can be ‘seen’ through facial and body movements in response to subtle questioning.\nUsing tricks of the trade you would be surprised at how easy it is to crack a password The Magic Circle member says: ‘Unfortunately, when it comes to thinking of a password far too many of us use ones we feel are safe but are commonly used – mothers’ maiden names, children’s names and sequences such as 123456.\n'One of the most popular ones adopted is the actual word password.’\nOther obvious combinations to avoid include ‘qwerty’ – a line of letters on the top left corner of a keyboard – and using the same number such as ‘1111’.\nPickpocket entertainer James Freedman agrees being random with your password choice rather than using something familiar is essential.\nFreedman, a UK fraud prevention adviser for the City of London Police, says: ‘Understanding the psychology of the bad guy can stop you becoming a victim.\nLook at the fingerprints you leave behind about your identity on the internet ‘Look at the fingerprints you leave behind about your identity on the internet. Social websites and other sources can divulge family information, address details, holidays and work facts. They will provide a jigsaw that when pieced together can give a thief the tools to possibly work out your password.’\nHe adds: ‘Remember, the easier the technology is to use, the easier it is to abuse. You would be surprised how many people also keep details of their PIN numbers and passwords in a wallet or purse. Once a pickpocket gets this, it unlocks a mass of private information about you.’\nFreedman, who starred in his own West End magic show, Man Of Steel, a couple of years ago, believes there is nothing wrong with writing down passwords in case they are subsequently forgotten. But he says this should only be done if they are kept somewhere safe and also written down in a code form to make them difficult to crack.\nMind-blowing: Mr Memory, played by James Hayter in the 1959 version of The 39 Steps, had amazing skills\n2. DEVELOP BETTER MEMORY SKILLS\nMr Memory was a secret agent in the 1935 Alfred Hitchcock movie thriller The 39 Steps who had incredible skills at memorising information.\nAlthough he was a fictional character played by James Hayter in the 1959 remake, mnemonist Dominic O’Brien is a modern-day equivalent with astonishing memory skills.\nAs eight-times World Memory Champion and in the Guinness Book of Records for memorising the sequence of 54 packs of playing cards, he has the ability to remember hundreds of passwords.\nO’Brien says: ‘If you can remember your own name, then you can remember a password or PIN. All that is required is imagination. For example, “My Name is Dominic”. I add up the number of letters in each word of this simple sentence to make 2427.’\nHe adds: ‘When it comes to passwords it is a matter of making an image in your mind and then turning this into a sequence of pictures to create a mini-journey. If these are linked to a location it will help you remember what a password is for – enabling you to hold a range of secret codes in your mind rather than repeating the same one.’\nAn example he gives is using a password for a gym membership that might involve an image of you going on a journey to this gym.\nPerhaps you could imagine driving yourself there in an Alfa Romeo car and turning on the stereo which is blaring out a hit by 1980s band ABC – a memorable favourite such as Poison Arrow.\nYou could then envisage an American footballer from the San Francisco 49ers sitting in the back seat. On your way to the gym you also pick up Prime Minister Theresa May from her home at 10 Downing Street as she is also keen to start on a fitness regime.\nFrom this visual image you can come up with the password ARABC4910. A tough code to crack, but with strong imaging one that is easy to remember.\nYour imaging should have a combination of three elements – association, location and imagination. Together these stand for Ali – a boxer who packed a punch O’Brien says: ‘Let your imagination run riot – it helps when trying to remember passwords.\n‘If you regularly have to change a password then perhaps you could visit a library in your imagination and pick out a different book when it is time to come up with a new code.\n'Your imaging should have a combination of three elements – association, location and imagination. Together these stand for Ali – a boxer who packed a punch.’\nThe mnemonist points out that although these are useful tips that can help boost memory skills, you still need to concentrate your mind. He has written several books on improving memorising skills, including How To Develop A Brilliant Memory.\nFive-step action plan to beat fraud 1. BE VIGILANT\nIf you have a password or PIN code that relates in any way to your personal life or is easy for others to remember, change it immediately. It is also a good idea to change your password once every year or so as a precaution against thieves.\n2. CREATE A STRONG PASSWORD\nGo for something random using ‘mini journey imaging’. Take your time working out what you will use – your financial security is at stake. Consider a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols.\n3. IMPROVE MEMORY SKILLS\nWith strong imaging you should not forget your password. There is nothing wrong with writing it down but only somewhere hidden and safe. Write it in a code form and do not keep it in a wallet.\n4. USE TECHNOLOGY\nTake advantage of ‘password manager’ software – but trial it first before making a commitment. Some companies are now embracing biometrics that can read fingerprints, irises of an individual’s eye and speech patterns that add another valuable layer of security.\n5. REPORT CRIME\nCheck bank statements every month and be wary of any unusual messages via email or post indicating someone else could be using your identity. Be wary of so-called ‘phishing’ and never share passwords. Report anything of concern to police at ActionFraud.\n3. CONSIDER USING SOFTWARE\nA so-called password manager is software that allows you to store secret codes in an online bank vault. The codes are encrypted so no one else can read them.\nWhen you visit a website that requires a password you simply press on a security button logo provided by the password manager that should appear in the corner of your computer screen. It should then automatically fill in the secret details on your behalf.\nThere is a wide selection of password managers from which to choose and many are free. Unfortunately, not all the software available is necessarily going to be compatible with your computer or operating system.\nHelp: Sian John recommends a password ‘manager’\nFor example, password manager Norton Identity Safe works only with PCs and not Macs. RoboForm can be difficult to work on the operating system Google Chrome but should be fine on Firefox. Although it can take time to get to grips with security software, it will cut out the hassle of remembering passwords.\nSian John, a strategist at online security company Symantec – owner of Norton software – says: ‘You may not think you have a problem remembering your passwords right now, but as time goes by you will inherit more that must be remembered. A password manager overcomes this challenge.’\nJohn says a master code at least eight digits long is needed to unlock the online vault – and this must be changed every three to six months.\nShe adds: ‘If you lose a master password then you will be in serious trouble, so make sure it is etched in your brain. But in an emergency, the software company should be able to help.’\nAmong the most highly rated password managers are LastPass, Dashlane, RoboForm, KeePass, Sticky Password, 1Password and Norton Identity Safe.\nThese all have basic free options that allow you to try them out at no cost. It is often a case of personal preference as to which one feels right for you as they tend to offer a similar service.\nBut be aware that once signed up they may try to reel you in with a more comprehensive ‘premium’ service, perhaps offering unlimited password syncing between devices such as smartphones and laptops. This can cost up to £30 a year – but if it keeps passwords secure, it will be money well spent.\nJohn says: ‘When choosing a password manager it is worth finding where all your encrypted secrets are going to be stored. You don’t want to keep them on a laptop or phone as these can get lost or stolen. You are better off having them kept in a so-called “cloud” – an internet storage facility.’\nImproved technology is also helping with a range of biometric passwords that include voice recognition and fingerprint comparisons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:56:25.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
