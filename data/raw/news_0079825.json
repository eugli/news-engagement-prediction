Keep pets protected: Vets \nThe director of Sydney's Exotic and Rabbit Vets David Vella said the vaccine was crucial for protecting domestic rabbits from becoming infected. \n\"This virus potentially can cause obviously death in rabbits that are unvaccinated and not protected,\" he said. \n\"The main thing you should do is keep your vaccination up to date. \n\"[And] if possible you should be keeping the rabbit in a mosquito proof environment because that is the main way the virus is spread â€” via mosquitos.\" \nBlue Mountains resident Naomi Whitfield brought her pet rabbit Kenji into Mr Vella's surgery to get vaccinated. \n\"We received the notification about the new strain of the calicivirus being released and ... [Kenji is] ... my baby so we wanted to make sure he's protected,\" she said. \n\"The risk is always there so we want to make sure he's protected.\" Farmers hope virus is successful \nThe NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) said rabbits were Australia's most significant pest, costing up to $200 million a year in agricultural production losses. \nThe DPI's manager for invasive species research John Tracey said the department would monitor numbers before and after the release to measure its effectiveness. \n\"Basically what we're looking at is a post count about 30 days, a month, after the initial release,\" Dr Tracey said. \nThe original calicivirus that was released in 1996 killed off about 90 per cent of the rabbit population, but was less effective in cool, wet regions. \nKevin Edwards, who farms near Orange in central-western New South Wales, said the 1996 release had not been effective locally and he was eager for the latest rollout. \n\"I'm really hoping that it is successful, because of the way the virus has worked, they'll take out virtually a whole area,\" Mr Edwards said. \nMr Edwards said rabbits were having a crippling impact on producers. \n\"Virtually any plants that I plant, they never make it past the seedling stage because they just get ravished by the rabbits,\" he said.
