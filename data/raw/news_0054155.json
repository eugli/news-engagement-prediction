The star, who was expected to headline the popular musical festival in April, will be headlining the event in 2018 instead. A statement read: \"Following advice of doctors to keep a less rigorous schedule, Beyonce has made the decision to forgo performing at the 2017 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival. However, Goldenvoice and Parkwood are pleased to confirm that she will be a headliner at the 2018 festival. Thank you for your understanding.\" Although the festival have yet to confirm who will be replacing Beyonce, Radiohead and Kendrick Lamar are still confirmed to be performing over the two weekends. A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST \nFans expressed their disappointment to the news after having purchased tickets to see the Love on Top singer perform, with one tweeting: \"Lol @ me spending thousands of dollars to go to Coachella this year and her cancelling,\" while another added: \"Wait, did Beyoncé really pull out of Coachella.\" However, many people saw the upside to the news, with one writing: \"This is Bey way of telling us we need to get out coins together & don't be broke by 2018 when she comes back. That's all. Get. It. Together.\" Another person tweeted: \"Beyoncé being moved to headline 2018 Coachella is a blessing because now I can get on a payment plan for a ticket.\" \nGALLERY: the best festival hair inspiration from the stars at Coachella \nBeyonce showed off her blossoming baby bump during her Grammy awards performance in early February, where she also won two Grammys for Best Music Video and Best Urban Contemporary Album.
