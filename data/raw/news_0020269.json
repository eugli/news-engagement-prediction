Debra Clayton and Orange County Deputy First Class Norman Lewis on Jan. 9, once again, we donned our mourning bands to honor these two fallen heroes. The black bands are also a solemn reminder to the communities we serve that our crime-fighting efforts and promise to protect and serve come at a price. \nDebra and Norman were both great law-enforcement officers and remarkable people. Each had an infectious smile and drew people in with their loving personalities. In the days following their tragic deaths, this community learned about their lives, the sacrifice they and their families made, and the everlasting impact they had on the people of Central Florida. \nIn the past 30 days, we have all heard the stories about their remarkable contributions to our community. People would say that even after they received a ticket from Deputy First Class Norman \"Big Norm\" Lewis, they would thank him because of the kindness, compassion and humor he showed them in a routine traffic stop. \nWhile Lt. Clayton was a great patrol officer, she found her niche in specialized units and community policing. Debra loved those programs because they helped humanize police officers. She knew that something as simple as a smile could lead to a real connection — and she forged those connections throughout Orlando. When she was killed, the community reaction was so profound because so many people knew her. They had talked to her, walked with her in “Stop the Violence” marches. They listened to her when she urged people not to give up on their police department. \nThe loss of these two beautiful people, who gave everything to this community, only strengthens our resolve to fight for justice. The support law enforcement received following their tragic deaths— and the subsequent capture of their killer — has been overwhelming and deeply appreciated by our officers. \nWe are grateful for this community and know it understands the ultimate sacrifice these two heroes made while working to keep all of us safe. \nIt is difficult not to get emotional when I put that black mourning band over my badge. But it will be just as difficult and heart-wrenching on Thursday when the band must come off. \nAlthough there will no longer be a physical reminder over our hearts, we will always carry the loss and grief deep inside. We will never forget these two heroes. And our law-enforcement officers will continue to risk their lives every day for the community they love. \nOrange County deputies late Monday identified the deputy killed in a traffic crash while helping search for a murder suspect as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis.
