PHOTO FROM THE OFFICE OF BONG REVILLA \nFormer senator Ramon “Bong” Revilla Jr., detained for plunder over the pork barrel scam, has asked the Sandiganbayan for furlough to be with his ailing father when the latter undergoes surgery. \nIn his urgent motion, Revilla asked the antigraft court’s First Division to allow him to be with his father on Feb. 8 from 6 a.m. to 12 noon at the St. Luke’s Medical Center in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City. \nRevilla also asked for furlough to visit on Feb. 9 from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. ADVERTISEMENT \nRevilla said his 82-year-old father Ramon Sr. had been diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and was set to undergo trans-arterial aortic valve replacement. \nThe surgery will be on Feb. 8 at 9 a.m. with the preparation starting at 7:30 a.m. \nRevilla said he felt it his obligation to be at his father’s side to provide assurance and support. \nAccording to him, his father requested that he be at his side during the surgery. \n“Deeply worried and concerned about this recent unfortunate development, Senator Revilla again respectfully implores this Honorable Court’s kind consideration and compassion that he be allowed to visit, and be with his ailing and weak father while he is undergoing this major surgery,” Revilla said through his lawyers. \nIn the past, the court granted Revilla’s request to visit his father, who is at the intensive care unit of St. Luke’s in Bonifacio Global City. \nRevilla told the court that his father was again rushed to the hospital on Jan. 20 due to coronary heart disease. \nRevilla Sr. was in and out of the hospital from Jan. 26 to 31. \nEarlier, Revilla’s father was hospitalized due severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia. \nRevilla recently lost his petition before the Supreme Court, which sustained the finding of probable cause for plunder against him.
