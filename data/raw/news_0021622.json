President Trump’s eldest son helped start the company in 2010. It failed two years later. Credit Kate Thornton for The New York Times South Carolina regulators on Tuesday rejected an effort by the Trump Organization to limit its environmental cleanup liabilities at an industrial site once owned by President Trump’s eldest son. The decision is a rebuke of the Trump Organization and could result in millions of dollars in added costs for the company. It followed a refusal by the organization to provide regulators with required information about business and financial relationships between the president and his son Donald Trump Jr. The Trump Organization had no immediate comment. The issue grew out of the younger Mr. Trump’s involvement in Titan Atlas Manufacturing, a company that he helped start in 2010 in North Charleston, S.C., and that failed two years later. In 2014, Donald J. Trump, while he was still running the Trump Organization, bailed out his son, who was then facing payment of a $3.65 million bank loan to Titan Atlas. The elder Mr. Trump created an entity called D B Pace, which took over the loan and the six-acre Titan Atlas site. Last year, D B Pace applied to take part in a state program that would limit the company’s liabilities for pollution on the property, like chemical contamination of groundwater. \nAdvertisement   To qualify for such protection, however, the buyer of a contaminated property must not be affiliated with a former owner or have had earlier involvement with the site. The safeguard is in place to prevent polluters from evading their legal responsibilities. A Trump Organization lawyer, Michael Cohen, stated in D B Pace’s application that it met that standard because it had no ties to Titan Atlas and had never been involved in the management of the North Charleston property.
