A job with a law firm in Minneapolis led to his work at the players’ union. His departure from the union led to a political career in which he was known for a liberal voice on issues like the environment and campaign finance in his private law practice and as an unsuccessful candidate for governor and the United States Senate. “He was an economic justice warrior,” said Scot Ross, the executive director of One Wisconsin Now, a progressive advocacy organization. “He thought you should get a fair day’s wage for a fair day’s work. And he was a social justice warrior.” \n  Mr. Garvey was renowned in recent years for organizing the annual Fighting Bob Fest, a gathering for progressives featuring speakers and panels and named for Robert M. LaFollette Sr., a former Wisconsin senator and governor. Mr. Garvey described Mr. LaFollette’s politics as “synonymous with reform, getting corporate money out of politics and getting rid of the spoils system in government.” Mr. Garvey’s liberal politics placed him at odds with Scott Walker, Wisconsin’s Republican governor, who has clashed with labor unions. Working with the Republican-controlled state Legislature, Mr. Walker has cut taxes, expanded school vouchers and limited early voting. Mr. Ross said that Mr. Garvey thought the governor was “in the pocket of corporate special interests.” At a speech in Madison in 2011, Mr. Garvey exhibited his trademark wit when he said had been asked to say “something nice” about Mr. Walker. “It’s not that he lies,” Mr. Garvey said, “But that he has such a higher regard for the truth that he uses it sparingly.” Mr. Garvey is survived by his wife, Betty, and three daughters. Further information on survivors was not immediately available. He never won elective office. During his losing race for the Senate in 1986, his past in sports was used against him by his opponent, Robert W. Kasten. Mr. Kasten ran a television commercial that contended that $750,000 from the N.F.L. players’ union had “disappeared” when Mr. Garvey was its executive director. Mr. Garvey sued for libel, and Mr. Kasten eventually conceded that the ad was inaccurate. In settling the suit the next year, Mr. Kasten said that he had not intended to challenge Mr. Garvey’s integrity. “Of course he meant to challenge my integrity,” Mr. Garvey said. “That’s why he spent more than $200,000 to air that commercial repeatedly even after I offered proof that it was false and demanded that it be taken off the air.” A version of this article appears in print on February 23, 2017, on Page B15 of the New York edition with the headline: Ed Garvey, Who Took On the N.F.L. And Then Conservatives, Dies at 76.
