It’s generally assumed that the next-generation service will include faster speeds than today’s LTE standard and aim to better connect the Internet of Things. The FCC has started the process of making wireless spectrum available for “5G” use, too. But it’s still more of a concept than a finished product right now. \nWhat Verizon is calling 5G here is a preliminary standard it helped develop as part of its Verizon 5G Technical Forum , a group formed in 2015 that includes chipset and software makers like Cisco, Ericsson, Intel, Qualcomm, Samsung, LG, and Nokia. That tech aims to provide faster and smoother connections than 4G either way, but Verizon is hoping its moves here can influence what genuine 5G might look like. \nVerizon says that its Forum partners are “well on their way” to commercializing chipsets and devices that will use its spec, but it has previously noted that it may have to update the 5G equipment it plans to deploy to adhere to the eventual universal standard. \nThe other big caveat here is that the program won't include truly mobile internet service. Instead, it'll aim to provide a fixed wireless replacement for home and office connections that may rely on cables. \nNevertheless, while we’re still years away from true 5G being a part of everyday life, the announcement is another reminder that the day is coming in some form or another.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:51:47.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
