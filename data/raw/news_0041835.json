INQUIRER PHOTO / LEO M. SABANGAN II. \nThe Capital is Penshoppe’s biggest and newest flagship store! \nThe Capital is unlike any Penshoppe branch you’ve ever seen. Housed in UP Town Center in Quezon City, Penshoppe’s newest and biggest flagship store has your every fashion need from top to toe. Put it on top of your summer destination list because the brightest season only requires the hottest OOTDs. \nCOOL DISTRICT aka accessory central Caps section: If Justin Bieber had a walk-in closet for his snapbacks, it would probably look like this. Control your inner hoarder when you spot caps in teal suede, classic denim, embroidered designs of fries, finger hearts, cool beagles, “how about no” and “cocky” statements. (They Should Really Have This Sign: Cap Hoarder Alert!) ADVERTISEMENT \nFootwear: Patches and sneakers? Penshoppe’s comfortable kicks feature our favorite pairings: beer and pizza, bacon and egg, cheeseburger and fries. Find all the good combinations for your OOTDs here! \nSundazed: From lightweight steel frames to chunky sunglasses with a vintage retro vibe, Penshoppe has peepers for each face shape. The Capital is Penshoppe’s biggest and newest flagship store! \nEXTRA FRESH \nWho knew they had this much scents AND toiletries? The Capital has Penshoppe’s every product line! The Capital’s Denimlab is unlike any other you’ve seen, it’s literally a house of denim. \nDENIMLAB \nIt looks like a store on its own! We love how it transports us to a house of denim. All kinds of jeans are neatly stacked by style so you can easily find that perfect snug fit that you’re looking for. \nMEN ’S GRAPHIC TEES \nShirts are framed and displayed like art. (We’re tempted to buy the same shirts and DIY our own shirt gallery at home, TBH!) Maybe you’re a social media freak? You’ll definitely find an internet-themed statement shirt here that will give you loads of likes! (The designs to cop: Follow Me, Snap) There are also some winner tees that would make us think there was a Drake x Penshoppe collab, these include “Over and Sober” and “Fake friends showing fake love to me.” Embroidered statement tees will also appeal to those who like sporting the minimalist aesthetic. \nMEN ’S ALL DAY \nThis will be your favorite spot in the store if you’re OC AF. Shirts are neatly folded inside pigeonholes and are arranged in an apparent color gradient. Every shirt is also neatly arranged in every corner of this segment. All your basic needs are easily found here: T-shirts, polos and button downs. \nMEN ’S FRESH DROPS \nAre you into Japanese street style? We found the coolest oriental-themed bomber jackets here! Every piece got us saying “Swaaaag!” The Penshoppe Park was the Capital’s mini Coachella. DJs Tom Taus and Sanya Smith took over the music. \nFRESH DROPS BOUTIQUE \nA showcase room-like segment of the Penshoppe Capital lets you in on their latest fashion pieces and style. It’s the hot spot for all the cool new items. \nWOMEN ’S FRESH DROPS & ALL DAY \nWe seriously want to cop the mannequin’s outfit in Fresh Drops, a basic white cotton shirt paired with an olive green denim dress. You’ll find a baby blue button down with cat prints, and snug sweater with our eternal morning mantra: no talking before coffee in this new arrivals section. \nWOMEN ’S GRAPHIC TEES \nFor the girls who wear their hearts on their sleeves. Whether you air out your angst through fashion, or wear prints of things you love, there’s definitely a comfy find stacked in here for you. Don’t forget to pose behind the shirt wall with your #PenshoppePicks! \nCASHIER \nStaying in line has never been such a breeze, all thanks to the gorgeous faces of Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner, Sandara Park, Mario Maurer, Lucky Blue Smith and Cameron Dallas that you’d see on the Penshoppe screens as you wait your turn. \nSEATS \nPlace your non-shopaholic boyfriend here as you try on your #PenshoppePicks. It’s strategically placed near the men’s section, so he can check out the cool gallery-like aesthetic of the graphic tees, too. \nTag us on your social media photos and posts when you visit the Penshoppe Capital! #SuperXPenshoppe #PenshoppeUPTC Find out why hundreds lined up as early as 7 a.m. to get the first peek at the Penshoppe Capital on Sunday’s Super.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T14:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T11:25:41.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
