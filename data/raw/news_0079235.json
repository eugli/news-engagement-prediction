Few things in life bring Donald Trump more joy than live-tweeting cable news. Other billionaires may travel, kite-surf, or drive race cars to get their kicks; all Trump needs is his Android and a cable subscription. And the mogul’s eccentric pastime has served him well — you can’t kite-surf your way to the Oval Office, but you can, apparently, tweet your way there.\nBut with great power comes great responsibility.\nDuring his first month in the White House, Trump continued to pursue his passion, waking up to MSNBC’s Morning Joe every day, and sharing his impressions of the program with the good people of Twitter.com. When Joe Scarborough suggested that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon might be “calling the shots” in the Trump administration earlier this month, the president offered a prompt reply.\nI call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 But in the weeks since, Trump has begun to appreciate the enormous complexity of his new job. He realized that health care is actually complicated — and judicial review is a thing that exists . And so, the president decided to make the ultimate sacrifice. Per the Associated Press :\nThe White House looked to be finding its footing for a stretch last week …One of the most notable changes was made by the president himself, who scaled back his use of Twitter for a few days, particularly in the pre-dawn hours … One aide said the reduction in Trump’s early morning tweets was a result of his ending his habit of watching “Morning Joe,” the MSNBC show hosted by Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, longtime friends of the president who have been critical of some of his early moves. Trump is putting America first. (And less critical morning-cable-news programming second.)\nTags: morning joe president trump tweets cable news Trump Has Kicked His Habit of Live-Tweeting Morning Joe Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories President Trump: ‘Nobody Knew Health Care Could Be So Complicated’ Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on How Mattis Can Stand Up to Trump Trump’s Rollback on Transgender Bathroom Rule Is Just the Beginning Most Viewed Stories Kellyanne Conway Has an Interesting Way of Sitting on the White House Sofa President Trump: ‘Nobody Knew Health Care Could Be So Complicated’ Jimmy Kimmel Gives His Play-by-Play of Last Night’s Best Picture Mix-up, Revealing the Oscars’ True Hero: Denzel Washington Caitriona Balfe Is Here to Assure You That Outlander ’s Claire and Jamie Will Still Have Smokin’ Hot Sex 20 Years Later Why the Casey Affleck Sexual-Harassment Allegations Just Won’t Stick Everyone Realized All at Once That Was Mel Gibson’s Girlfriend, Not His Daughter The Best, Worst, and Most Headbanded Looks of the 2017 Oscars Rosie O’Donnell Will Lead a Protest Against Trump Before His First Congressional Address Did Democrats Just Begin an Electoral Comeback by Winning in Delaware?
