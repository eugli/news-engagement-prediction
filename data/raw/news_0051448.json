Ismail was arrested the same day, before he could deliver the drugs to Ong. He gave investigators information leading to Ong’s arrest the next day. \nOn the stand, Ong said his first encounter with cannabis, also known as weed or marijuana, was in the US where he studied in the 1990s. Marijuana was “freely and readily available” there and he developed an addition, he said. \n“Marijuana calmed me down, helped me focus, helped me sleep”, he said, explaining that he suffers from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and insomnia. \nSince his arrest, “he has weaned himself off” cannabis, Mr Tan said, adding that Ong was “ready to face the music”. \nOn Monday, Ismail had denied that Ong worked with him to traffic cannabis and testified that Ong had no idea from whom or where the drugs came from, or even how much they cost. \nThe investigator in charge of the case had also testified earlier this month that he never found any evidence suggesting a third party was involved, or that Ong intended to on-sell the drugs. He only said that by buying the drugs, Ong was abetting the trafficking of cannabis – to himself. \nThe trial continues on Tuesday afternoon. - CNA/mz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:44:07.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
