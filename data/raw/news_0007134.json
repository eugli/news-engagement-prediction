Photo: Johan Swanepoel/Getty Images/iStockphoto An asteroid the size of a house flew by Earth this afternoon , passing within 101,000 miles of us at 3:23 p.m. First spotted on January 30 and named 2017 BS32, the asteroid is the fourth giant space rock to have a close encounter with Earth since the start of 2017.\nLast Sunday, a truck-size asteroid zipped by Earth at a distance much closer than today’s. Passing at just 32,200 miles, the 19-foot asteroid was six times closer to Earth than the Moon is. Asteroids also gave Earth a “close shave” on January 9 and January 24.\nThree of the four asteroids to pass Earth so far this year have been discovered just days before whizzing by, something that astronomer Paul Cox from the Slooh Observatory says “raises a few eyebrows.”\nIf it’s complete global destruction you’re worried about (or hoping for) when you hear about these asteroids, you should not be concerned. Astronomers estimate that it would take a rock much bigger than any that have passed in 2017 to wipe out the entire planet.\nTags: outer space asteroids Top Stories Trump Throws Curveball at Bibi, Urging No ‘Unilateral’ Action on Settlements An Asteroid Buzzed Earth Today, the Fourth Near-Miss of the Year Most Americans Disapprove of Trump — and His Executive Orders Most Viewed Stories U.S. Military Sources Claim Trump Approved Yemen Strike Without Enough Preparation The Serial Creators’ Next Podcast Series Sounds Like a Juicy, Bingeable Delight Trump Is Reportedly Obsessed With How the People Who Work For Him Dress America’s Leading Authoritarian Intellectual Is Working for Trump What’s New on Netflix: February 2017 There Was One Explicit Sex Scene in Girls That Even HBO Wouldn’t Allow This Poll Is the Best News Liberals Have Had in a Long Time Here’s the Full Beyoncé Maternity Photo Shoot You Were Waiting For A Brief History of ‘Cash Me Outside, Howbow Dah?’ White House Considers Deporting Legal Immigrants for Being Poor Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer Who Are the ‘Black Bloc’ Protesters Who Rioted on Inauguration Weekend?
