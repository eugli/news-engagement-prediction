This is especially so as the victims are poor peasants struggling for survival. \n“It is most disheartening that people labouring and striving for their daily bread in accordance with the commandment of God and charter of the United Nations could be so savagely kidnapped by unscrupulous elements. \n“To visit such act of mindlessness and wickedness on some people who believe in the dignity of labour is the very definition of man’s inhumanity to man,’’ he said. \nThe lawmaker said that activities of kidnappers on Lagos waterways and coastal areas had become a source of worry, especially for the governor and the Assembly. \n“Crime does not pay; every criminal will have a date with the law. Braimoh said. \nAccording to him, no criminal has ever operated unchecked for more than five years. \n“These criminals must halt this unacceptable spate of kidnapping so as to allow the performing Gov. Akinwummi Ambode to retain his tempo and focus for the benefit of all.” \nNAN reports that the kidnapping of the guards and farmers in a farm at Igbodu area of Epe by gunmen in military camouflage occurred barely two weeks after kidnappers invaded the same community and abducted four persons. \nKidnapping in Lagos State now attracts death sentence if the victims die in the hands of their abductors, while the act of kidnapping attracts life imprisonment. \nThe punishments were provided for by the state’s Kidnapping Prohibition Bill, 2016, which was signed into law by Ambode on Feb.1. \nThe state Assembly had passed the bill into law on Jan. 5. adekunle ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T18:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:22:44.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
