Even common people like us need to take stock of all our assets and liabilities at some point in our lives. Although this may sound scary, but the fact is no one has come to live in this world forever. Whoever gets born has to leave this world one day. Therefore, if you want to keep your financial house in order as well as make the financial future of your loved ones secure, then you must plan and do certain things in life to ensure that they not only know your financial details, but are also cared for properly in the unlikely event of your departure.\nHere are the top 10 financial steps to consider before departing from this world:\n1. Make a list of all assets & liabilities\nYou don’t have to be a millionaire or billionaire to do this. Even common people like us need to take stock of all our assets and liabilities at some point in our lives. But keeping the uncertainties of this world as well as to manage your finances well, the early you do it, the better it would be for you and your family. Also, keep updating the list at least annually so that things are easier on your family in your absence. Your assets may include physical assets like your home, jewellery, etc, and also financial assets like insurance policies, bank accounts, and PF accounts, among others. You also need to include in your list all your outstanding debt and other liabilities.\n2. Protect yourself and your loved ones\nAfter taking stock of all your assets and liabilities, you need to protect yourself as well as your loved ones from the uncertainties of life, and make them as much financially secure as possible. “Taking adequate life cover (like term insurance) for yourself is the safest and cheapest way to secure your family’s financial future. This will ensure that your family members and other dependents won’t have to face any financial problem if something untoward happens to you,” says Ashish Kapur, CEO, Invest Shoppe India Ltd.\nYou may also watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:37:50.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
