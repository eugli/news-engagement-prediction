It still takes place at Winchester University, which is just brimming with racial tension, and in the above teaser, we see that advising them of what costumes are appropriate for Halloween is still a must. Judging from the teaser up above, while we're sad to see Tessa Thompson not returning as Samantha White, Logan Browning is more than capable of filling her shoes. Interestingly enough, she says that while she didn't get feedback from Tessa's performance in the film, she says that she feels that she \"watched the film enough times to gather her take on Sam,\" although she made sure to mention that Tessa's a \"superstar,\" and probably doesn't have the time, given her HBO and Marvel commitments. Browning did break down what Sam's all about for those who might not have seen the film: \"Sam is a bi-racial student at this Ivy League school, Winchester,\" Browning says. She is just sick and tired of the racial tensions and stereotypes on campus.\" How does Sam combat the nonsense on campus? By starting a satire radio station on campus entitled Dear White People to \"stick it to the man.\" Either way, Dear White People will truly be one-to-watch.
