Photo: Josh Robenston \nTo begin, one car – the newly-released Model X – will be on display on the sixth floor of the Myer store. There are plans to expand the initiative to other stores and states. \nPriced at $115,000, the Tesla will easily eclipse the most expensive thing currently on sale at Myer. It's all part of the retail giant's push to bring in new and innovative brands to the shop floor.

The Tesla deal is part of the \"new Myer\" strategy, which is spearheaded by chief executive Richard Umbers, to give consumers \"what they want, when they want it\".

Technology has shortened the supply chain, so we're competing with the biggest and best,\" Mr Scott said. \nSince Mr Scott's arrival, Myer has made deals with several \"disruptors\" including Uber and Virgin Australia, proving that for major brands, who you hang out with is becoming as valuable as what you do.
