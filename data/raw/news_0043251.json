His car remained upside down as it slid down the apron. Safety crews, after determining Fontaine was responsive, flipped the car and had to cut the roof to extricate him. \nFontaine, 19, of Fletcher, N.C., was making his first ARCA start. \nThe race was called due to time constraints and the need for repairs to the SAFER barrier. \nAustin Theriault, who was running first at the time of the crash, was declared the winner. Terry Jones finished second, followed by Shane Lee, Dalton Sargeant and pole-sitter Tom Hessert. Theriault passed Jones for the lead with eight laps to go. \nThe Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series is slated to open tonight with the Advance Auto Parts Clash. \nFollow Tucker on Twitter @HeatherR_Tucker \nSafety crews transport Justin Fontaine after he was extricated from his car, which had flipped upside down.
