The range closed three decades ago, but several buildings remain, including the bunkers, which are under mounds of earth.\n“Snakes like deep, dark places,” said Crocodile Lake manager Jeremy Dixon in a press release about the pythons.\nThe harmful python has been a persistent problem in the Everglades, and scientists fear they snakes are now moving south “where several Keys species are defenseless against the large, invasive reptiles.”\nDixon said the area at Crocodile Lake is also home to black rats and hundreds of feral cats, both of which are food sources for the snakes.\n“The easy availability of food means the pythons could thrive on the Keys just as easily as they have multiplied in the Everglades,” the press release said. “For more than two decades, an array of big snakes have spread and bred in the Everglades. Their presence has had a devastating effect on native birds, deer and other species in the park.”\nWildlife officials encourage anyone who sees a python to report the details so hunters can try to remove it.
