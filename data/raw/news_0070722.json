GPS evidence from Roof's car showed he slowed and then stopped at the church for two to three minutes, according to prosecutors. \nThe U.S. government said the similarities between the two churches suggested Roof \"intended to continue his racially-motivated violence at Branch AME Church that night and, more specifically, that his intended targets were African-American congregants at a church.\" \nDefense lawyers in court documents disputed that Roof stopped at the church. He did not carry out another attack and ultimately drove to North Carolina, where he was arrested the following morning. \nKearston Farr comforts her daughter, Taliyah Farr, 5, as they stand in front of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church Joe Raedle/Getty Images \nRoof told Federal Bureau of Investigation officials after his arrest that he was “worn out” by the Emanuel shooting and did not plan to commit more killings after he fled Charleston. \nProsecutors did not discuss the second church during Roof's trial. \nThe court filing said GPS evidence showed Roof had visited the Branch AME Church before, scouting it out in February 2015 as he prepared for an attack. \nProsecutors said Roof admitted he researched various targets, including other African-American churches and a “black festival” before choosing Emanuel AME Church for the shooting. \nDuring Roof's trial, prosecutors showed jurors a list of black churches in South Carolina that investigators had found in a backpack in his car after his arrest. \nThat list included Emanuel AME Church but not the Branch congregation, according to the newly unsealed court documents. \nRoof, who earlier this month made a motion for a new federal trial, also faces a second death sentence if he is convicted of murder charges in state court. No trial date has been set. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:37:47.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
