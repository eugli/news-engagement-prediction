They have also lodged complaints with the Kota collector and the divisional commissioner. \nTheir counsel Dileep Sharma said, “The litigants have sent a PIL to the chief justice of the high court accusing MB International School authorities of letting their staff sing the English version of the national anthem during Republic Day celebrations; the staff took 67 seconds, instead of the laid norm of 52 seconds, to finish singing, which is a violation of constitutional provisions.” \nMayor and school director Mahesh Vijayvargiya said Rabindranath Tagore’s English rendering of the national anthem was sung at a cultural programme in the evening on the Republic Day and not during the flag hoisting. “There was no disrespect to the national anthem. While the video was of 67 seconds, the anthem was sung in around 56 seconds,” Vijayvargiya told HT on Thursday. \n“I am not sure whether the singing of the anthem is a violation. I have talked to legal experts who have said it is not a violation. If at all it is an error, I on behalf of school authorities am ready to apologise,” said Dinesh Vijay, another director of the school. \nAsked for his opinion on the issue, advocate Akhtar Khan ‘Akela’ said, “There is no clarity in the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 and also in the Supreme Court rulings regarding singing of the national anthem in any language other than Hindi, or the time limit; so it cannot be said with certainty that singing the anthem in English or in more time is an offence. The court can take appropriate decision on it.” \nArticle 51A(a) of the Constitution enjoins every citizen to respect the national flag and anthem. In December last year, the Supreme Court said all cinema halls across the country should play the national anthem and that those present “must stand up in respect” to “instill a feeling within one a sense of committed patriotism and nationalism”. \nThe order touched off a debate on whether forcing someone to sing the anthem infringes fundamental rights. Section 3 of the 1971 Act, (as amended in 2005) does not dictate whether a person should sit or stand when the anthem is playing or sung. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:53:37.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
