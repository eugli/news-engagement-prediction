Photo by: Pagani \nIt's based on the fixed-roof Huayra, but it's actually lighter and stiffer than the coupe. Photo by: Pagani \nCertain exterior parts between the two models differ, like bumper and wheel designs. Photo by: Pagani \nTwo fixed roofs are available -- a carbon-fiber hard top, and a fabric soft top, the latter of which is easier to install and remove. Photo by: Pagani \nDespite losing its roof, the Huayra Roadster retains its gullwing-style doors. Photo by: Pagani \nPower comes from a Mercedes-AMG V12 engine. Photo by: Pagani \nIt makes 764 horsepower and 737 pound-feet of torque. Photo by: Pagani \nPagani promises a max cornering figure of 1.8G, which is the highest of any car equipped with road tires. Photo by: Pagani \nIt'll officially debut at the Geneva Motor Show in March.
