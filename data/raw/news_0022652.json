By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Wednesday, February 8, 2017 - 21:23 0 Follow @ZeeNewsSports \nNew Delhi: Anil Kumble is not your ordinary coach who would give instructions from the sidelines. \nKnown for his strict regimes and serious drills, the spin legend was seen in a 'high-octane' fielding session with Ajinkya Rahane and Abhinav Mukund. \nHere's the video shared by the Indian cricket board on Tuesday: \nRahane is coming back from an injurt lay-off, and is expected to feature in the one-off Test against Bangladesh starting tomorrow. \nThe Mumbai batsman last played a Test in November last year. \nBut, Mukund's chances of playing the match is still a matter of conjecture. \nHe is making a comeback to Indian squad after five years. Mukund has played five matches, with the last one coming way back in 2011. \nVirat Kohli & Co will host Bangladesh in an one-off Test at Hyderabad.
