A win for any of Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Hull City this weekend would put the Foxes in the relegation places. Wins for all three and they would be bottom by the time they face Liverpool on what will now be a highly charged occasion at the King Power on Monday. \nAfter 26 games last year they were top on 53 points, two ahead of Spurs. This season they are 17th after 25 games, with only 21 points. Last season they had lost only three games compared with 14 in this campaign, and conceded only 29 goals compared with 43 this term. Indeed, they only conceded 36 in the entire 2015-16 season. \nThe difference is stark and, very clearly in the opinion of Leicester's owners, dangerous. Read more from Phil McNulty \nPat Murphy, BBC Radio 5 live \nI understand some influential players in the dressing room, who were part of the Nigel Pearson squad a couple of years ago, were making graphic contrasts with team spirit and the organisational qualities of Pearson compared with Ranieri this season. \nThe club never really lost faith in Pearson this time two years ago. Despite the fact they were in the parlous position, the general feeling was that he had the dressing room and knew where he was going. He left in the summer of 2015 for different reasons - personal reasons associated with his son, who was on the staff. \nQuite clearly, Ranieri had lost a lot of key allies in that Leicester dressing room with long memories. What did Leicester say? \nOn 7 February, Leicester issued a statement saying Ranieri had their \"unwavering support\". Sixteen days later they sacked the 65-year-old Italian, who had signed a new four-year deal in the summer. \nHis departure came a day after the Foxes won praise for their performance despite losing 2-1 in their Champions League last-16 first-leg tie at Sevilla. \n\"Ranieri was told he was sacked on Thursday afternoon in Leicester once the team returned from Spain, but the suggestion is the owners decided before that defeat by Sevilla,\" said BBC sports editor Dan Roan. \n\"The decision was taken very reluctantly but the club's owners are desperate to avoid relegation and its consequences.\" \nFoxes vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said: \"This has been the most difficult decision we have had to make in nearly seven years since King Power took ownership of Leicester City. \n\"But we are duty-bound to put the club's long-term interests above all sense of personal sentiment, no matter how strong that might be. \n\"Claudio has brought outstanding qualities to his office. His skilful management, powers of motivation and measured approach have been reflective of the rich experience we always knew he would bring to Leicester City.\" \nSrivaddhanaprabha added: \"His warmth, charm and charisma have helped transform perceptions of the club and develop its profile on a global scale. We will forever be grateful to him for what he has helped us to achieve. \n\"It was never our expectation that the extraordinary feats of last season should be replicated this season. Indeed, survival in the Premier League was our first and only target at the start of the campaign. \n\"But we are now faced with a fight to reach that objective and feel a change is necessary to maximise the opportunity presented by the final 13 games.\" \nA news conference with Leicester assistant manager Craig Shakespeare will take place at 13:00 GMT on Friday.
