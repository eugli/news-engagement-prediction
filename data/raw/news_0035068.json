Freud says it comes out of the fact that subconsciously, they find them fatherly, and for a young woman, her father is the ultimate epitome of manlihood.\nSmooth operators \nOlder men may not be as wild as young ones, but they surely know the tricks of the trade. They know how to flatter with poetry and pun, make every stroke a master's, and charm like a gentleman things where little lads often fail.\nReady and able \nOlder men have had decades to work on their act, and are ready to take the plunge.\nFull of surprises \nElderly men were more likely to surprise women with flowers and chocolates, as compared to men half their age.\nMr. Moneybags \nOlder men are financially stable, so, they can afford to shower their partners with gifts.\nThe romance factor \nConsultant psychiatrist YA Matcheswalla says that while there is no age limit for romance, agrees that for men in their fifties, romance depends on the overall quality of the relationship. \"Younger men tend to be more self-absorbed and egotistical.
