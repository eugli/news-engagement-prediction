Now, the challenge reached its final stages, and Motorola selected 12 finalists who have the chance to see their Moto Mods become commercial products. The 12 final Moto Mods include some models that we've seen before. For example, we've got a pretty thin Moto Mod that features wireless charging and an IR blaster (costing $45), or a Moto Mod Edge that has a built in multi-LED system for customizable, illuminated notifications (starting at $55). Other interesting options include a Moto Mod with a 2200 mAh battery and integrated solar cell (for charging on the go), two walkie-talkie Mods, a wallet Mod with GPS and a 1200 mAh battery, and a digital recorder Mod. In March, Motorola will choose grand prize winners who will have the chance to visit the company's headquarters in Chicago, and even to receive an investment of up to $1 million from Lenovo to further develop their ideas.For now, the Moto Mods that have the highest number of backers on Indiegogo are the one with wireless charging, and the Moto Mod Edge. But there's still plenty of time for the other ideas to be funded, as campaigns last from 1 to 2 months. You can check out - and fund, if you wish - all the 12 Moto Mods at the first source link below. After you do that, feel free to tell us which of these potential Mods you'd like to have. The Moto Mod Edge is one of the interesting options selected by Motorola Popular galleries", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:42:00.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
