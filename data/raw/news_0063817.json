Jerry Brown Floodwaters surround homes and cars on February 22, 2017, in San Jose (CBS). \nSACRAMENTO (AP) â€” California Gov. Jerry Brown wants to spend $437 million on flood control and emergency response in the water-logged state. \nBrown said Friday he would do that by redirecting $50 million from the state general fund and requesting a $387 million appropriation from the voter-approved 2014 Proposition 1 water bond. \nBoth actions require approval by the state Legislature, and Brown is asking that it be done as soon as possible. \nBrown also is seeking updates on flood inundation maps and emergency action plans as well as enhanced dam inspections. \nThe governor says that overall the state has $187 billion in unmet infrastructure needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:51:56.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
