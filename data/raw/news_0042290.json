"highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "Articles The best resorts for weekend skiing Two or three days on the slopes can be just as rewarding as a full week Credit: La Clusaz 15 November 2016 • 6:00pm \nA short break can be just as fulfilling as a whole week on the slopes. With just a hop, skip and jump from the airport to the mountains, these 10 resorts are ideal for a quick getaway. \nUnless otherwise stated, prices are per person, half board, based on two sharing, including flights and transfers. Mayrhofen, Austria Best for: Hitting the park \nMayrhofen will be whatever you want it to be, and very successfully too. It can rock, it can rap, it can be the king of cool, all wrapped up in a picturesque, heavily‑timbered, rustic village that has strictly maintained traditional Tyrolean architecture as it has grown. Innsbruck airport is close, about 70km/an hour’s drive away. \nThe Vans Penken Park at Mayrhofen is widely regarded as one of the very best terrain parks in the Alps. At 2,100m, beneath the Sun Jet chairlift on the main Penken mountain, its six sectors are rammed full of kickers, boxes and rails, including the huge Rainbow Box and the massive, multi-faceted Beastbox multi-jib. It has a separate kids’ area, also with its own lift, as well as dedicated spaces set aside for intermediates, advanced and pro riders. Mayrhofen's ski area has an extensive network of red runs Credit: Frank Bauer \nThe ski area is full of red runs (including blues which are tricky enough to qualify as reds) and suits decent intermediates perfectly – but it also has Austria’s steepest marked run, the Harakiri. And after fresh snow there is a respectable amount of off piste not far from the marked runs. The resort’s main nursery slopes are on the Ahorn mountain, on the opposite side of town from Penken. The slopes back down from Ahorn are pleasantly steep, very quiet in the mornings and usually freshly groomed. \nMayrhofen has a busy centre and is well served by equipment rental, clothing and high-end winter fashion shops. Après is manic here – it starts in huts up the mountain when lunch is hardly over. Bars surround the top of the Penken gondola at 1,800m, and more are waiting in the village, with Europop throbbing from the speakers. The Ice Bar next to the bottom gondola station goes completely wild between 5pm and 8pm. Harakiri Bar in the main street shows some sophistication, and is the place for a quieter drink either early, pre-dinner or late. It hosts a pleasantly mixed crowd, for all age ranges, and snacks are served too. Where to stay \nHotel Kramerwirt is a traditional inn run for generations by the Kröll family. Ski Solutions ( skisolutions.com ) offers a four‑night stay in the Altes Forsterhaus annex directly opposite the hotel for £375 per person, half board. The price includes use of all hotel facilities, with meals served in the hotel’s dining room – the food is particularly good. Courmayeur, Italy Best for: Putting on the ritz \nCourmayeur lies less than two hours from both Geneva (115km) and Turin (150km), allowing for the essential weekend component of easy transfers from a choice of airports with lots of flights. This charming, traditional mountaineering village sits at the Italian end of the Mont Blanc tunnel, with Chamonix in France at the other end. \nWell-heeled Italians from Milan and Turin arrive in numbers on Friday evening. They throng the pretty pedestrianised Via Roma, with its smart designer boutiques and comfortable cocktail bars. You may be forgiven for thinking that the pistes will be crowded in the morning, but, fortunately, only a small proportion hit the slopes. They come for the party rather than the piste. Courmayeur is a charming traditional Italian village \nThe ski area, which best suits confident intermediates, isn’t huge and can easily be covered in a single weekend. Restaurants both in town and up on the mountain are of a particularly high standard, and Courmayeur is one of the spiritual homes of the long, lazy lunch. \nThe off-piste terrain offers considerable challenges. There are classic runs from the Cresta d’Arp (2,755m) at the top of the lift network, while the Skyway Monte Bianco cable car from Entrèves, a five‑minute drive from Courmayeur, provides access to serious descents from Punta Helbronner (3,462m), including the famous Vallée Blanche. Upgraded last season, the new cable car has 360-degree rotating cabins for taking in the view from all angles. Where to stay \nThe friendly three-star Bouton d’Or has spacious rooms and plenty of parking, and is close to the village centre, with its wide range of enticing restaurants. From £395 for three nights’ b&b with Momentum Ski ( momentumski.com ). La Clusaz, France Best for: A traditional feel \nClose to Lake Annecy and around 70km/an hour’s drive from Geneva airport, La Clusaz is all too often overlooked by skiers and snowboarders making their way to the Trois Vallées and other famous resorts of the Tarentaise. However, it has well‑groomed intermediate and advanced slopes to offer, as well as an unmistakeably French village ambience. \nLa Clusaz and smaller Manigod share 132km of slopes, while those of Le Grand Bornand and its lift-linked satellite village, St Jean de Sixt, are 10 minutes away by free shuttle bus. All four are covered by the same Aravis lift pass, and together they have 220km of terrain. Most of the slopes are intermediate, but the Balme area of La Clusaz offers long runs and considerable challenges. \nLe Grand Bornand has a dedicated freeride area that is neither patrolled nor groomed, but is avalanche protected. It’s sufficiently extensive and challenging to satisfy even the most demanding skier or snowboarder. New for the 2016/17 season there’s also a 200m covered magic carpet for beginners in the Rosay sector of Le Grand Bornand, and improved snowmaking facilities in the Maroly sector. Best weekend ski holidays \nAs well as making La Clusaz an ideal spot for the weekend, airport convenience explains in part why so many Brits have bought chalets and apartments here. However, their presence is muted – the Aravis resorts are mainly frequented by the French and, unlike in some big-name destinations, you feel you’re actually on holiday in France. \nLa Clusaz is a thriving community all year round. Le Grand Bornand is the home of Reblochon cheese, an inescapable inclusion in all its forms from fondue to raclette on every restaurant menu in the region. Where to stay \nThe three-star Hotel Alpen Roc is located in the centre of La Clusaz, 150m from the lifts, with panoramic views from the bar/lounge area. From £123 for two nights with Peak Retreats ( peakretreats.co.uk ), excluding flights and transfers. Engelberg, Switzerland Best for: Big off-piste routes \nEngelberg is situated at 1,050m above beautiful Lake Lucerne. It’s easily reached in 75 minutes by car from Zürich airport, 100km away, or by train in two hours. This attractive small town has been dominated for the past 900 years by a magnificent Benedictine monastery, which looms vast and ancient amid Swedish-run bars and ski shops. The younger of the remaining monks can still be found enjoying the pistes, but sadly they no longer ski in their habits. The rotating cable car is one of Engelberg's notable features \nThe real action is on Mount Titlis with some superb pistes and long powder runs from 3,028m. An eight-seater walk‑in gondola, the Titlis Xpress, new for 2015/16 and accessed by escalator from the base, whisks up to 2,400 people an hour to the mid-mountain hub of Stand via a mid-station at Trübsee, an ascent that takes just 16 minutes. The sunny pastures of Brunni, on the opposite side of the town, form an ideal beginner and intermediate ski area dotted with huts providing welcome refreshments. \nEngelberg hosts many non-skiing Asian visitors, summer and winter. The resort’s long-standing rotating cable car to Titlis, with its stupendous views, is a draw – as is Engelberg’s use as a location for Bollywood films . But in winter it’s mainly the domain of skiers and snowboarders. At weekends there’s full-on nightlife and an influx of young freeriders from Zürich and Lucerne. Where to stay \nDating back to 1898, the charming three-star Hotel Bellevue Terminus sits right opposite the train station, with the ski bus stop outside. The hotel has a lively après bar called Buena Vista and the Yucatan restaurant, which serves innovative dishes with a twist, such as Mexican spare ribs and teriyaki beef. From £696 for four nights b&b with Flexiski ( flexiski.com ). Sölden, Austria Best for: Snowsure partying \nWithin an hour’s drive of Innsbruck airport, 80km away, Sölden offers high-altitude, intermediate-friendly slopes in the same Ötz valley as Obergurgl , and historically has fewer British holidaymakers. But that may be changing after Sölden’s role as a backdrop in 2015 Bond film Spectre put it on more people’s radar. \nSölden’s record for reliable snow stems from its two glaciers, the Rettenbach and the Tiefenbach, and its season continues for most of the year. There are 33 lifts and 145km of piste, but the slopes seem much more extensive than this suggests, largely because the three mountains above are well connected, without any annoying paths between them. Most of the pistes are intermediate, but there are lots of off-piste opportunities. best ski resorts in Austria \nThe ski area closes at the beginning of May, but reopens for summer in June. Apart from a few weeks’ closure in September for maintenance, it remains open in the autumn and into winter. \nSölden is certainly not the prettiest resort, stretching for 2km with hotels and shops dotted about the main valley road with no real centre. However, its nightlife is younger and wilder than that of its more conservative neighbour Obergurgl. Where to stay \nThe three-star Hotel Tyrol is on the resort’s main street, midway between the Giggijoch and Gaislachkogl gondolas. From £516 for three nights with Ski Weekends ( skiweekends.com ). Kitzbühel, Austria Best for: A last-minute break \nThis medieval silver-mining centre, with its heavily buttressed walls and delicate painted frescoes, rightly deserves its reputation as the most beautiful ski town in Europe. Salzburg (75km) and Innsbruck (95km) airports are both within an hour’s drive. Kitzbühel’ s one serious disadvantage is its low altitude. It’s usually at its snowy best in the last week of January and the first three weeks of February. \nKitzbühel is famous for the Hahnenkamm , the meanest and scariest downhill race on the World Cup ski circuit. But in reality, away from this single crazy race weekend, Kitzbühel is a piste pussycat that packs more miaow than kapow, with tons of largely intermediate terrain that seems to go on forever. The main ski sector is Hahnenkamm (home to the Streif downhill course, which is a family‑orientated run once the jumps have been removed), reached by a modern gondola from the edge of Kitzbühel. The others, all seperate from each other, are the Kitzbüheler Horn, and neighbouring Bichlalm, a little area given over to freeride. Skiers can try the infamous Streif run Credit: Erik Guay \nThe pedestrianised Vorderstadt, the town centre inside the heavy old city walls, is set against a backdrop of the jagged teeth of the spectacular Wilder Kaiser Mountains. Old coaching inns that have been converted into hotels vie for space in the ancient streets alongside smart fashion boutiques, wickedly expensive cafés and a buzzing nightlife scene. The Londoner is the resort’s long-established British pub, which has been entertaining party animals for nearly 30 years. The coolest nightclub in town is Club Take Five (club-takefive.com), which has been running for almost 20 years. It has three elegant bars, a large VIP area, a range of cocktails and resident DJs. Where to stay \nThe four-star Hotel Schwarzer Adler in the centre of Kitzbühel offers state-of-the-art design and superb facilities, including a spa and rooftop pool with stunning views. From £735 per person for three nights with Snowscape ( snowscape.co.uk ). Barèges/La Mongie, France Best for: Great-value France \nOnly an hour away from Lourdes airport (50km) or 90 minutes from Pau (110km), these two contrasting resorts share the 100km of pistes in the Grand Tourmalet ski area – one of the biggest in the Pyrenees. Packages to these resorts can cost half as much as in the French Alps. \nBarèges is a centuries-old spa town a bus ride away from the lifts while La Mongie, over the Col du Tourmalet pass (closed to cars in winter, frequently used in the Tour de France during the summer), is a purpose-built ski station that’s lacking in charm but convenient for the slopes. The best ski resorts youve probably never heard of \nThe runs suit intermediates best, but there’s also some challenging off piste, including from the Pic du Midi observatory (where it’s possible to stay the night), which is reached by cable car from La Mongie. The terrain above La Mongie is open and treeless and includes black runs that are considered to be among the toughest in the French Pyrenees. The slopes in Barèges are gentler and tree‑lined, but much smaller in area. Where to stay \nThe ski-in/ski out Residence Le Montana is close to the centre of La Mongie. Apartments have a balcony or terrace, plus sauna, hammam and fitness room access. From £297 for a self-catering studio apartment that sleeps up to four, for four nights, with Erna Low ( ernalow.co.uk ), excluding travel. Innsbruck, Austria Best for: Staying in the city \nFinding a hotel in the Alps that will take bookings of less than a week is not always easy. That’s not a problem in Innsbruck, with its huge choice of accommodation. It boasts a medieval old town of narrow cobbled streets and colourful buildings along the River Inn, while short transfers and regular flights with BA or easyJet make this a very convenient hub. Innsbruck provides the chance to combine skiing with a city break \nApart from being the Tirolean capital, Innsbruck is a ski resort in its own right, with considerable charm and fine restaurants. You can be on the slopes within an hour of leaving the airport, as the Nordkette ski area is reached by a funicular and a cable car from the city in 20 minutes. From Hafelekar (2,256m), novices can admire the city and Alpine views, and experts can tackle Karrinne, one of Europe’s steepest ski routes with plenty of gnarly off piste. There are 11km of mostly red pistes, and a small terrain park with kickers, rails, rollers and boxes. \nAs well as Nordkette, the OlympicWorld lift pass covers 300km of piste in eight other ski areas, including Kühtai and the Stubai Glacier, all easily reached from Innsbruck by free ski bus. Where to stay \nAn Olympia SkiWorld package offers four nights’ half-board accommodation in Innsbruck and a three-day lift pass. Hotel choices range from comfortable three-star options to five-star splendour at the Grand Hotel Europa. Prices start at €395, excluding travel. Book through the tourist office ( innsbruck.info ). Morzine, France Best for: Clocking up the miles \nThe 650km of terrain in the Portes du Soleil ski area covers 13 resorts in two countries. An 85km/75-minute drive from Geneva airport , Morzine is a great base for the area, ideally suited to families. Catch an early flight and you can be cruising down the pistes above the resort well before lunch. \nThe Portes du Soleil’s variety of slopes suits everyone, from complete beginners to veteran powderhounds, and in a winter when there’s good snow cover the area goes straight to the top of the class. Morzine’s one disadvantage is low altitude. Pistes are not always open the whole way back down, so think carefully before booking an early- or late-season holiday here. best ski resorts in france \nMorzine isn’t just a ski resort – it’s a proper little Alpine town that has a year-round life stretching far beyond having fun on the mountains. One of the livelier French resorts, Morzine has a good après scene. Several places around the base area get busy as the slopes empty, before the party moves to venues nearer the resort centre. The Cavern in town is open from 4pm till 2am with two daily happy hours, occasional fancy dress parties, and enough shots to keep you dancing into the small hours. Where to stay \nThe Farmhouse ( thefarmhouse.co.uk ) is the common name for Le Mas de Coutettaz, Morzine’s finest chalet-hotel. Originally built in 1771 and converted into its present form 20 years ago, it now has 11 bedrooms in the main house and the annex. Guests dine at a communal banqueting table. From €152 per person per night, including afternoon tea and wine with dinner, plus shuttles to and from the slopes each day. Chamonix, France Best for: Off-piste challenges \nChamonix lies just 100km/an hour’s drive along the Autoroute Blanche from Geneva airport. It’s populated on winter weekends by a 21st-century breed of dedicated skier – the City Commuter. CCs have the funds to rent a flat for the season and buy all their airline tickets for the winter months well in advance. However, you don’t have to be a serial weekender to enjoy its four ski areas. \nChamonix’s setting beneath the cliffs and tumbling glaciers of the Mont Blanc massif is tremendous, and the bustling town isn’t lacking in charm. Its old buildings have kept their sedate Victorian and more fanciful Belle Epoque look, and now that the centre is traffic-free, it offers pleasant strolling, with cafés overhanging the river Arve’s torrent and a wealth of interesting shops. Chamonix is a freeride playground Credit: M Dalmasso \nMuch of the resort’s legendary status is due to the Argentière/Grands Montets sector. The upper part is an immense freeride playground, much of it glacier, punctuated by two long black pistes. Renowned runs such as the Pas du Chèvre, Couloir du Dru and Rectiligne have pitches of up to 45 degrees – not for the faint-hearted. \nIn the centre of town, the two-stage cable car to Aiguille du Midi (3,842m) gives access to the famous off-piste Vallée Blanche, which runs back down through the glaciers, delivering some of the most spectacular scenery the Mont Blanc range has to offer. If the run is open all the way back to town, it’s a vertical of 2,800m and 24km in length. If not, it means taking a gondola near the end of the run followed by a train home. Watch | The most annoying mistakes Brits make on a ski holiday 02:11 \nDon’t rule out Brévent-Flégère on the sunny side of the valley. Adrenalin junkies who obsess about Argentière spend hours in line there when they could be enjoying great conditions at Flégère – powder, spring snow or groomed corduroy depending on the time of day and year. Le Tour/Vallorcine is ideal for entry‑level off piste to build confidence, with an easy link to the attractive woodland runs and more rugged terrain above the village of Vallorcine. Where to stay \nThe cool, modern Hotel Le Morgane in the centre of town, near the Aiguille du Midi cable car, has a pool, spa and a Michelin‑star restaurant. A four‑day guided Belle Traces off-piste course with Ski Weekend ( skiweekend.com ) plus four nights b&b at the Hotel Le Morgane starts at £999 per person, based on a group of four to six people, including airport transfers but excluding flights.
