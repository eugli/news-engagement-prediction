Some dragonflies found in the app: Aurora bluetail (damselfly) Found: Australiawide Australasian slimwing (dragonfly) Found: Northern NT, costal and northern Queensland Australian tiger ( dragonfly). Found: northern Australia Blue percher ( dragonfly) . Found: northern Australia, southeast Asia Iridescent flutterer (dragonfly) Found: northern Australia Tiny longlegs (damselfly) . Found: northern NT, Cape York, New Guinea Palemouth (dragonfly). Found: northern Australia, New Guinea \nPart of Northern Territory folklore, flocks of dragonflies are viewed as a sign the dry season is about to begin. \nDragonfly expert Professor Jenny Davis from Charles Darwin University created the app to remove some of the mystery surrounding the insect after studying it in Kakadu National Park. \n\"The tropics are where dragonflies have diversified,\" she said. \n\"There's something like 300 species and 100 of those occur here in the north, so we have a third of Australia's fauna.\" \nThe species seen in the Northern Territory at the end of the wet season live in temporary water bodies, which become dry, Professor Davis said.
