Jeremiah Rivera was inside his home when he was attacked around 6:45pm, officials and relatives have said. His father, Joel Rivera, broke into tears as he recalled the moment he walked in to find his young son on the living room floor, choking on his own blood. Speaking to the New York Daily News , he said 'He didn't have a face, just teeth, that was all I could see. And the smell of raw meat.' 'I did the best I could to help that baby. I ran in there. It was so horrific. The baby was lying on the floor in a pool of blood and body matter,' witness Lloyd McCammon told the Daily News . 'All of his left face was gone. He couldn't breathe. I pressed a towel to his face but there was nothing left,' the 39-year-old said. He lives in the first floor Brooklyn apartment with his father, his mother, his two brothers and two sisters. Animal Care and Control took custody of both dogs, and their fate remains unclear Jeremiah has deep lacerations on his face and neck, and his father estimates there are as many as 2,000 stitches on his face. He lost two pints of blood One of Rivera's two dogs, who are typically kept in their crates, somehow escaped after Rivera made his children grilled cheese sandwiches and then fell asleep on the couch as they watched cartoons. He said that he believes he fought the dog to save his sisters. 'He made a noise, and started breathing. I yelled ans screamed so loud everybody came running. I ran in the street everybody started calling on their phones calling for help,' Rivera told the Daily News. Following the attack, witnesses saw his father running out of the house screaming 'Oh god,' before fainting on the front stoop. He sprinted after medics as they wheeled away his son, collapsing on the sidewalk after first responders pulled him away from the waiting ambulance. Looking at his bloodstained clothing, Rivera said: 'The last time I had his blood on me was when I cut his umbilical cord. I am responsible for this. This is my fault. 'Man's best friend? How you going to do this to my son and be called man's best friend.'
