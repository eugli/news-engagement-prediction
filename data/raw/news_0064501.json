You complain about it to your friends, and they all say the same thing, \"It's probably just muscle!\" which you wave off as hogwash. I mean, does muscle actually weigh more than fat? Could you drastically improve your body while maintaining the same number on the scale?\nWell, Adrienne Osuna, a fitness blogger based in Santa Maria, California, is here to prove that you definitely can. As the mother of four precious boys, Adrienne struggled for years with her weight, going back and fourth with yo-yo dieting. Finally, she decided that the key wasn't to stop eating, but to start working out, and to stop obsessing about the scale.\nThis place is a real life winter wonderland ❄️🌲✨ pictures don't do it justice it's amazing!\nA post shared by ↠a d r i e n n e o s u n a↞ (@adrienneosuna) on Dec 28, 2016 at 7:48pm PST\n\"I lost 60 pounds then I quit dieting (always gaining and losing weight and yo-yo dieting and I was so over it.)\" she wrote on her blog. \"I started heavy lifting and feel in love. I recompositioned my body with out dieting. I lifted heavy 4x a week and I intermittent fasting. Within a year or so if that I was down 3 dress sizes and the scale still hadn't moved. But everyone kept telling me how I looked so good and asking how much I lost which was really encouraging!\"\n But powerlifting makes you manly....💁🏼😉 Just posted a new blog post on how I started powerlifting 💖 #linkinbio\nA post shared by ↠a d r i e n n e o s u n a↞ (@adrienneosuna) on Jan 25, 2017 at 10:26am PST\nLast week, she shared a before/after photo of her progress. As you can see in the photo, she's only lost two pounds, but she looks so much leaner and more toned, because she lost fat and gained muscle.\n\"This was all hard work in the gym lifting heavy weights and intermittent fasting,\" she wrote in the caption. \"And for anyone just seeing this for the first time YESSS really 2 lbs, the scale doesn't measure fat vs muscle!\"\nThe comments I get are unreal 😒😠 I never post two of these pics back to back but this one is for all you sweet souls that stuck up for me, left me sweet comments, and sent me messages saying these help you so much. 💞 Here's a REAL side view for you. NO I WASN'T PREGNANT on the left 😂 the right was this morning. No dieting, just heavy lifting, which is anaerobic and uses stored fat for fuel, and intermittent fasting which also taps into stored fat especially from the belly, and hitting protein. I lost fat and gained muscle which made my weight pretty much stay the same but as you can see I've lost a lot of inches and dress sizes. I'll be answering questions I got in my story today 😘😘 Negative comments get deleted and ppl blocked 🙂🙂🙂\nA post shared by ↠a d r i e n n e o s u n a↞ (@adrienneosuna) on Jan 19, 2017 at 9:20am PST\nSo remember that the next time you step on the scale after an intense workout.\nFrom: Good Housekeeping\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BPdEFPPAhPP/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BOliZOigN8E/", "http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/news/a42986/adrienne-osuna-fitness-instagram/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQntpWdhZyM/", "http://www.adrienneosuna.com/p/about.html", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPsoa-qACTQ/"], "published": "2017-02-22T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:54:31.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
