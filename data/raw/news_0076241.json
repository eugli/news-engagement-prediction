For years, Sony had put out water-resistant phones, but didn't get much attention. But then Samsung introduced the feature in the Galaxy S5 in 2014, and Apple added it to the iPhone 7 last year. LG couldn't ignore that trend. \nThe addition of wireless charging -- which is only coming to the US -- was driven by the need to soften the blow of taking away the option to remove and swap out the battery. \n\"We pack everything we can to make it a premium smartphone,\" Hwang said. \"We reflect what people really want.\" Does it matter? \nBy targeting some of the rumored key features of its flagship rivals, LG hopes to plant an early flag in the ground when it comes to the premium phone market. \n\"The G6 is a truly thoughtful design,\" Lam said. \nThe question is whether consumers will entertain a third option for a premium phone, with Apple and Samsung dominating sales. The LG G6 in all its tall statuesque glory \nPhone enthusiasts have expressed disappointment that the G6 would run on Qualcomm's older Snapdragon 821 chip -- essentially last year's high-end processor. LG has said that the 821 was the best chip available when the company began planning the G6's development and opted not to wait. It's widely believed that the upcoming Galaxy S8 will be the first phone to use the new 835 . \nLG, however, may have some reason to be optimistic. Samsung could be vulnerable after the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. In his presentation to journalists on Saturday, Hwang made the point to say that the company added a battery puncture test during the development of the G6. \nBut a core problem remains the same: LG lacks the marketing heft of its larger rivals. It can't get in your face with ubiquitous ads like Samsung, and it lacks Apple's large loyal following. \n\"Compared to stiff competition from Samsung and Apple, don't expect LG to challenge either one of them,\" Lam said. \nThe G6 could very well be the phone of Mobile World Congress -- a tough task given the appearance of new Nokia and BlackBerry phones -- but that may mean little once Samsung rolls up next month.
