He was, he says, “a bit put out”. Two months later another letter arrived, signed by a number of local heads, warning of a dire funding shortfall if the government’s plan for a new national funding formula, taking money from some areas and giving more to others, goes ahead in its current form.\nAt this point, Fearon-Low says, “I was incensed” – not at the headteachers, but at the crisis they face. “They have to come to us to meet core funding. That any government can put them in that position is awful.” He launched a petition asking the education secretary, Justine Greening, to address headteachers’ concerns.\nA report by the National Audit Office has said schools face a funding reduction of 8% in real terms by 2019-20. They are already facing many increased costs: higher contributions to national insurance and teachers’ pensions, the introduction of the “national living wage”, pay rises and the apprenticeship levy. There’s no extra money for these, nor is funding per pupil rising in line with inflation. Schools have made some painful cuts in staffing and services, including counselling. Now some are begging.\nThere are no rules to prevent schools from seeking voluntary fees from parents, whether for extras such as trips, or for basics like books and staff salaries, as long as there is no link between that and admission to the school. But it doesn’t mean the idea is popular.\nCuts, cuts, cuts. Headteachers tell of school system ‘that could implode’ Read more \nMark Clutterbuck, the headteacher of Coombe Hill juniors, feels he has no option. “I really don’t like asking parents for money,” he says. “It feels uncomfortable.” He hopes parents’ response will be “frustration with national government because it’s a huge issue”.\nMany other schools are also turning to parents, it seems. A letter sent in September by the Hawthorns primary school in Wokingham says that despite lobbying its local MP and council for better funding, and trying to save money on staffing, the school is “still struggling to balance the budget, which is in conflict with our desire to offer the high-quality education and learning opportunities we want for our pupils”.\nIts headteacher, Pat Kerton, says: “I’d reached the point I couldn’t afford to update my reading scheme, and that’s a core essential for a core subject.” Her letter to parents asks for between £1 and £5 a month, while trying to reassure them that they should not feel “under financial pressure or feel guilty” if they cannot pay. Does she think she should have to ask parents for donations? “Absolutely not. Parents told me they were willing to do it, but it’s wrong. They’re already paying [for education] in their taxes.”\nAt Caversham primary in Reading, headteacher Ruth Perry has just asked parents for £1 a day, £190 per year, because of cuts to the education budget, and said the decision was “not one that we are happy to be making”. And in Muswell Hill, north London, Fortismere secondary school is linking its financial plea directly to unavoidable increased costs – rises in pension   contributions and pay increases – and the planned national funding formula. “Indicative numbers suggest that Fortismere will lose 1.5% of its budget in 2018/19 and 3% in 2019/20” says the letter, dated January this year. The school is asking each family for £25 a term, because despite previous fundraising efforts, “departments still face a large shortfall in funding compared to previous years”.\nGrammar schools are not immune. Ilkley grammar school has asked parents for up to £180 a year. Pate’s grammar school in Cheltenham has a button on its homepage called Making Ends Meet, which states it faces “such extreme revenue pressures that we have no alternative but to direct our entire fundraising efforts to help the ‘revenue pot’, rather than to purchase additional resources”. Pate’s is not asking parents to pay for extras – it’s clear that the £125,000 it is trying to raise this year is for core funding. Other grammar schools are threatening to follow suit.\nSo what do parents feel is acceptable? It seems to come down to what is a desirable “extra”, and what is essential to teaching and learning. Joanna Yurky, co-founder of the parents’ campaign Fair Funding For All Schools , says three schools in her area are asking for regular direct debit fees. “What has changed is the need for schools to depend on parents to plug the shortfall. It’s different from having a whip round for the Christmas show,” she says. “We make absolutely no criticism of the heads or governors – our criticism is aimed at the government, which is causing an unsustainable financial situation for our schools. It is no secret, but the government is trying to pretend that it is not happening.”\nA parent with children in a Bracknell secondary has been asked to pay £15 for art materials and £20 for design technology. She was then charged further sums for visiting speakers, which she had thought would be covered by an existing special activities payment of £35, which she had already been asked to pay for each of her children. “When you know not everyone will pay, it becomes a tax on those who do. I don’t think it’s acceptable.”\nSir Andrew Carter, chief executive of the South Farnham Educational Trust, based in wealthy west Surrey, and a favourite headteacher of Michael Gove, said recently that schools ought to be able to ask for fees of around £500 a year and seek private investment to help with their finances. But what works in South Farnham is less likely to raise the same amounts in poorer areas. Even in affluent areas some parents will struggle. One in north London says she has been asked for £700 this year. “We only pay part of it – we just can’t afford it.”\nYou can see the cuts in the NHS but the cuts in schools are as dire | Laura McInerney Read more \nSome heads say they will never ask parents for money on principle. John Tomsett, of Huntington school in York, says: “Until we are officially privatised and charging becomes the norm, I will continue to refrain from asking taxpayers to make additional contributions towards educating their children beyond the tax they have already paid.”\nAnd Marc Rowland, policy and research director at the National Education Trust, warns that asking parents for donations could deter poorer families from applying to certain schools. “There are subtler approaches being adopted too, like ‘you must buy a tablet or device for your child joining year 7’,” he says. “Those asking for contributions need to get inside the skin of their disadvantaged families and see it from their perspective.”\nAsked whether seeking money from parents was an acceptable solution to schools’ cash crisis, a Department for Education spokesperson said that school funding is at its highest level on record. The DfE is still consulting on the new funding formula, he said. “We are protecting per pupil funding so where pupil numbers rise, the amount of money schools receive will increase.”\nThis misses the point, says Yurky. “It’s really angering parents that [the government] is trotting out this line,” she says. “Our starting point should be that all schools can and should be funded adequately.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:53:20.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
