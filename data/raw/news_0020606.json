Stephen Curry (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:40 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:40 p.m. ET \nStephen Curry is notoriously quiet when it comes to politics, but he allowed a glimpse into how he felt about President Donald Trump on Wednesday. \nThe Warriors star responded to Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank's statement that Trump is an \"asset\" to the country. \nMORE: Check out the latest NBA jersey ads for the 2017-18 season \n“I agree with that description,” Curry told The Mercury News , “if you remove the ‘et'.\" \nSo, Curry, who is a huge endorser of Under Armour, is not a Trump fan. He said he thought he knew where Plank stood in regards to politics, which is why he was surprised to hear Plank praise Trump. \n“I spent all day yesterday on the phone with countless people at Under Armour, countless people in Kevin Plank’s camp, my team, trying to understand what was going on and where everybody stood on the issue,\" Curry said. \"Based off the release that KP sent out this morning, and what he told me last night, that’s the Under Armour that I know. \n\"That’s the brand I know he’s built and one that, as of Wednesday afternoon, is something that I’m standing on.” \nAccording to Curry, Plank distanced himself from Trump's controversial presidential policies and said he only meant Trump was an asset as a businessman. \nThat explanation seemed to soothe Curry, who said he was worried Under Armour would emulate Trump's values. \n“It’s a fine line but it’s about how we’re operating,” Curry said, “how inclusive we are, what we stand for. He’s the President. There are going to be people that are tied to them. But are we promoting change? Are we doing things that are going to look out for everybody? And not being so self-serving that it’s only about making money, selling shoes, doing this and that. That’s not the priority. It’s about changing lives. I think we can continue to do that.” \nFor now, it seems to be water under the bridge for Curry and Under Armour. Curry made it clear he doesn't want to talk politics with Plank or the Under Armour team — he looks at their partnership as business.
