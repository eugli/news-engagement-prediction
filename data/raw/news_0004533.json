Story continues below \nPennsylvania’s Punxsutawney Phil, arguably the best-known weather predicting whistle dog, woke around 7:20 a.m. and saw his shadow, forecasting another six weeks of winter. \nShortly after 8 a.m., Wiarton Willie emerged from his burrow and didn’t see his shadow, predicting an early spring \nPort Stanley was in on the fun again this year as the Pierside Pub hosted Princess Sandy Stanley. \nTaz and Jim from AM980’s sister station FM96 were broadcasting live from the pub as Sandy awakened around 8:10 a.m., and like Sam and Willie, didn’t see her shadow. \nPunxsutawney Phil, the American groundhog of the group, was the only one who saw his shadow. \nLast year, Canada’s furry forecasters had mixed predictions. \nSam and Sandy emerged from their burrows and both didn’t see their shadows, predicting an early spring. However, Willie saw his shadow, forecasting another six weeks of winter. \nRegardless of who saw their shadow Thursday, a typical Canadian winter usually doesn’t end until after March 16th. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
