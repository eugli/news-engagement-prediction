My focus is my children, our children and my focus is finding this way through. We are and forever will be a family and so that is how I am coping. I am coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer.” \nJolie filed for divorce from Pitt in September, citing irreconcilable differences. The actress also requested full custody. \nIn the months following the divorce announcement, Pitt was investigated for child abuse after an alleged incident between the “Burn After Reading” star and the couple’s son Maddox took place on a private plane. \nIn January, the former Hollywood golden couple released a joint statement about the split, stating they would continue with divorce proceedings in private from then on. \n“The parties and their counsel have signed agreements to preserve the privacy rights of their children and family by keeping all court documents confidential and engaging a private judge to make any necessary legal decisions and to facilitate the expeditious resolution of any remaining issues,” read the statement provided to The Huffington Post. “The parents are committed to act as a united front to effectuate recovery and reunification.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST: Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie: Their Romance In Pictures Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie: Their Romance In Pictures 1 of 26 In December 2005, Brad's publicist confirms that he is in the process of becoming a legal parent to Maddox and Zahara, who Angelina adopted in 2003 and 2005, respectively.
