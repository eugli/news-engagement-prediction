As the performance continued, two skeleton figures, one dressed in a suit with a red tie and the other in a red blazer and skirt, floated across the stage as the homes (with the help of backup dancers) began moving and parting the way for Perry and Marley. \nViewers were quick to point out that the skeletons were dressed in the same outfits that Trump and Theresa May, prime minister of the U.K. and leader of the Conservative Party, donned during May's visit to the White House back in January. \nPerry and Marley ended the performance by joining hands and defiantly pumping a fist in the air. Did anyone else realise the skeletons on Katy Perry's Brit Awards performance is Theresa May and Donald Trump? #BRITs2017 pic.twitter.com/0Li55hMHV4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:51:22.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
