I would find it terribly sad.” Leicester City produced a miracle to win the Premier League Credit: GETTY IMAGES \nL ineker, Leicester’s most famous son, also claimed the club’s fans would rather they were relegated on the back of a fairy-tale title-winning season than endure a decade of “mid-table safety”. \n“Even if they go down, it makes the legend even greater,” said Lineker, who kept a promise to present Match of the Day in his underwear on the opening day of the season following the club’s 5,000/1 shot triumph last year. \n“If they go from staying up, after being on the brink of relegation, to champions the following season and going down the next, it almost improves the miracle of winning the title. \n“It’s still the most staggering, astounding thing that’s ever happened. If you were to say to any Leicester fan, ‘We’ll take away the title in exchange of 10 years of mid-table safety’, they would all say ‘No, it’s fine – we’ll just get relegated’. \n“This is the reality; this is the price of living the dream and the miracle. \n“Fans will always worry about their team, and it’s not been as much fun for Leicester this year, that’s for sure. \n“But to have lived through what happened last year was magical, and if that means the knock-on effect has been difficult, so be it.” Claudio Ranieri has received a vote of confidence Credit: REX FEATURES \nL ineker began his own footballing career with boyhood idols Leicester before leaving to join Everton and later Barcelona. \nStar striker Jamie Vardy turned down a move to Arsenal last summer and Lineker said: “When you look at him now, with the benefit of hindsight, he may wonder if he should have joined Arsenal and he might have done okay for them.” \nLineker claimed Leicester were good enough to “just about hang on” and avoid the same fate as the Manchester City side of 1938 but was not as bullish about their chances of doing so while continuing what has been another dream run in the Champions League.
