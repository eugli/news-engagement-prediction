Well it is possible and while it may not be the most exciting of meals that you will be eating, the extra money in your bank account will really add up. \nIn addition, with far fewer unnecessary items in your shopping trolley, your weight is also likely to benefit, since we tend to eat the volumes of food that we purchase. \nThis weekly menu was developed using food items found at a mainstream (not discount) supermarket.

Not only can they be added to minced meat but also made into patties and soup and a single packet will give you at least 3-4 serves. \nBread — multigrain loaf $3.00 \nYou can find loaves of bread for a little as a dollar but a standard wholemeal or multigrain loaf allows you several lunch sandwiches as well as toast for breakfast several days each week will cost around $3.00. \nChicken Tenderloins — $7.00 for 500g \nYou can generally find stir fry beef or chicken tenderloins for around $7 at major supermarkets which in turn can be used for two dinners and as a sandwich topping. \nFruit 1kg — $3.00/kg \nToday apples and peaches were both available for this price, which would give you 4-5 pieces of fruit for snacks through the week.
