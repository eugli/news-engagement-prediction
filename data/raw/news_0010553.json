Here are the highlights: \n\n1. Bhukamp aa hi gaya, koi to kaaran hoga, dharti maa rooth gayi hongi (Yesterday there was earthquake. I express my sympathies who got affected by it. \n\n2. But I was wondering why did the earthquake come. \n\n3. Some see opportunity to serve in a scam as well. \n\n4. Kal bhukamp aaya, kendra sarkar Rajya Sarkar ke sampark me hai. \n\n5. Aakhir bhukamp aaya kyun,jab koi SCAM mein bhi seva,namrata ka bhaav dekhta hai to dharti maa bhi dukhi ho jaati hai aur bhukamp aata hai. \n\n6. We remember how democracy was under threat from 1975 to 1977, when opposition leaders were jailed, newspaper freedom curtailed: PM Modi . \n\n7. It is due to this 'Jan Shakti' that the person born to a poor family can become the Prime Minister of India \n\n8. There are many people like me, who could not die for the nation during the freedom struggle but we are living for India & serving India \n\n9. I had said it from the Red Fort- every Prime Minister has contributed to the nation. \n\n10. Let us understand & appreciate inherent strength of our people & take India to newer heights. Faith in Jan Shakti will give results \n\n11. Many of us, couldn't die for the nation during freedom struggle, but we're living for India and serving India: PM @narendramodi in Lok Sabha \n\nI had said it from the Red Fort- every Prime Minister has contributed to the nation: PM @narendramodi in the Lok Sabha \n— PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 7, 2017 12. I was surprised that there were some who made cleanliness also a political issue. Why can't we work together on ushering a Swachh Bharat \n\n13. Congress feels only 1 family got Independence for India. The root of the problem lies there \n\n14. When Rail budget was first presented, the transport sector was different. Now things are different & a more comprehensive look is needed \n\n15. When rail budget was first presented, transport sector was different. Now things are different \n\n16. Kisi ko to zimma lena padega ki jo chize gala ho gayi hain unko dekhe. Hum iss disha mein aagey badh rahe hain \n\n17. From Day 1, we have been clear- we are ready for a discussion on demonetisation but some were more keen on TV bytes & not debates \n\n18. Pehle din se sarkar keh rahi hai ki charcha ke liye taiyaar hain, aapne socha charcha hui to Modi fayda utha le jayega \n\n19. पहले होता था – कितना गया, अब होता है – मोदी जी कितना लाये...this is how discourse has changed after we have assumed office \n\n20. Kisi ko to zimma lena padega ki jo chize galat ho gayi hain unko dekhe. Hum iss disha mein aagey badh rahe hain \n\n21. It does not matter how big you are, you will have to give back what belongs to the poor. My fight is for the poor \n\n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:29:43.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
