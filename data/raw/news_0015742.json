A self-described “patron saint of the unloved and unlovely”, he was a parish priest in South Melbourne for nearly 40 years and the co-host of Sunday Night Safran on Triple J for a decade. \nWhile the 82-year-old has since retired from these roles, he remains at the helm of the Father Bob Foundation, which feeds about 600 of Melbourne’s homeless a week, supports at-risk children and advocates for the poor. He recently said his goal for 2017 was to help “tackle sadness”. \nAhead of his panel appearance at the Womadelaide festival on 13 March, where he will be discussing religion’s role in environmental responsibility, Guardian Australia will be meeting up with Father Bob to ask him your questions on any topic you fancy – be it priestly, personal or political. We’ll be recording his responses for a one-off podcast.
