The Oscar victory “hopefully creates some incentives to make movies like this,” he said. \n“Moonlight” had brought in $22.3 million in domestic ticket sales through Sunday, the smallest take among the best picture nominees, according to comScore data. \nOscar recognition can boost theater, DVD and digital sales for the winning films. Last year’s best picture honoree, “Spotlight,” took in $5.9 million at U.S. and Canadian theaters after the award, comScore said. \nFor Amazon and Netflix, the accolades provide bragging rights they can use in marketing to help win customers to their subscription video services. \n“It will make them a must-subscribe destination for film fans,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at comScore. \nAmazon paid $10 million for “Manchester by the Sea” at the Sundance film festival. The movie has earned $46.8 million at domestic theaters, and will appear later this year on Amazon’s Prime Video service. \nAmong all studios, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp ( LGFa.N ) took home the most trophies including six wins for musical romance “La La Land” and two for “Hacksaw Ridge.” Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) won four including best animated feature for “Zootopia” and best documentary for ESPN’s “O.J.: Made in America.” \n(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Sandra Maler) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:45:21.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
