Volkswagen became embroiled in an emissions scandal in 2015 Credit: PA \nAnalysis by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) found NO2 is estimated to be responsible for 23,500 deaths in the UK each year. \nGovernment advisory panel the Committee on Climate Change believes 9% of new car sales should be electric by 2020 for the UK to meet its legal obligation to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels. \nIn 2016 the market share of new car sales for alternatively fuelled vehicles was 3.3%, up from 2.8% the previous year. \nIn June last year then-transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin said it had been a mistake for former Labour chancellor Gordon Brown to slash taxes on diesel. \nMr Brown reduced duty on low-sulphur fuel in 2001, which contributed to an increase in annual diesel car registrations from 3.45 million to 8.2 million. \nA Government report published in April 2016 showed that diesel cars being sold in the UK emit an average of six times more nitrogen oxide in real-world driving than the legal limit used in official tests. \nThe Department for Transport investigation found all of the 37 top-selling diesel cars tested exceed the legal limit required for laboratory tests when driven for 90 minutes on normal roads. \nMinisters insisted no laws had been broken by the manufacturers as cars are only required to meet the lab test regulations. \nA scrappage scheme to boost the motor industry ran from May 2009 until March 2010, offering motorists #2,000 to scrap an old car for a new model.
