Historic. Ever. \nRachel Lindsay, a contestant on the current Bachelor season, will be named the next star of ABC’s The Bachelorette , TVLine has confirmed. That makes the Texas attorney the first African-American star of any Bachelor or Bachelorette season, after 33 combined seasons for the reality franchise. \nLindsay’s casting is set to be officially announced on Monday’s Jimmy Kimmel Live . But the pressure has been mounting on the franchise for years to put a non-white person in the role of Bachelor or Bachelorette. Executive producer Mike Fleiss teased on Twitter this morning that a “historic announcement” was in the works: We've decided to let our friend @jimmykimmel make the historic announcement during tomorrow night's show. #thebachelor \n— Mike Fleiss (@fleissmeister) February 12, 2017 \nBut there is one small detail yet to be ironed out here: Rachel is still in the running to win Nick Viall’s heart on the current season of The Bachelor ! Rachel got the coveted “First Impression” rose from Nick in the premiere, and seemed like a frontrunner all season long. But this news all but cinches that she doesn’t get the final rose from Nick at the end — which is a bit of a spoiler, really. So we can probably assume that Rachel gets eliminated tonight, clearing the path for her historic Bachelorette run. \nAre you excited to see Rachel as the next Bachelorette ?
