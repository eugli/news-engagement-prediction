The suspension resulted from claims the Patriots deflated footballs to gain a competitive advantage.\nA federal appeals panel reversed Berman’s decision. Brady served the suspension at the start of the season capped by Sunday’s 34-28 overtime victory against the Atlanta Falcons.\nBerman offered his congratulations to the Patriots, saying they showed “us all never to quit, everything is possible, and the importance of teamwork.”\n___\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:23:50.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
