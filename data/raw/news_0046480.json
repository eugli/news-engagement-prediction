You've got to live with the sorts of problems that Patty's got,\" he said. \n\"She had to hand in her car license, she can't drive a car anymore. She's been taken off the electoral role… things like that. But apart from that it's quite manageable at the moment.\" \nThroughout my time with her, I am struck by her lucidity about some things and her complete lack of memory about other things. 'I don't like dementia' \nThe Raabes, both in their 70s, have been married for 53 years and have three adult children. \nWhen she was younger, Pat was a busy working mum. As well as looking after her family, she managed a busy medico-legal psychiatrist's practice and enjoyed her work. She also had an active social life and a wide circle of good friends. \nBut in 2012, Pat was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Since then the condition has progressed slowly and steadily. \n\"I don't like dementia. It affects me remembering things. But I'm 'with it' a lot of the time,\" she said. \n\"It also affects me being spaced out and not knowing anything for 12 hours or something, and that freaks me out. I don't know who I am.\" \nShe hates losing her memory and she hates the loss of control. \n\"I hate it when I don't remember. I'm frightened of saying the wrong thing. I have always been so 'with it',\" she said. \nAfter spending time with Pat, I can picture her as a beautiful and vivacious woman who managed her domestic, work and social life so capably — and with a good deal of charm. I imagine her as the life of a party. \nNow she hates going out. She used to go out to community activities with other people with dementia, but stopped after a while as she hated being reminded of her illness. \n\"I don't join in anything anymore,\" she said. \n\"I like him to go out and mix. I don't go out anymore. I'll go over to the shopping centre. I'll go to family.\" \nPat's dementia has meant Ed has had to take on the role of carer. He spends much of his time doing chores around the house — pottering in the garden, preparing meals and caring for Pat. \nBut he does still take part in the social activities in their village. \n\"We have got our own bowling green down here. So I go down and talk to the ladies.\" \nWhen I ask Ed if Pat's needs confine him to the home, he says he doesn't see it like this at all. He reflects that when you grow old together, your needs change and mutual understanding evolves. Challenges of caring \nHe describes waking up one night to find Pat in the backyard, unconscious with cuts to her head. \n\"She'd fallen over and cracked her head. So we brought her inside and I found bowls of ice cream with chocolate sauce on them — everywhere. Even in the back seat of the car,\" he said. \nEd cleaned and dressed her wounds, but Pat didn't remember a thing even when he showed her the pictures on his phone. \nOn another occasion, Ed was woken by a neighbour at three o'clock in the morning. Pat had wandered over to their house in the middle of the night. \n\"I was embarrassed. I had an old daggy nightie on instead of a lovely nightie… I was so embarrassed. They had to wrap me up in a rug,\" Pat said. Knowing what's ahead \nPat knows more about dementia than many of us. She saw her mother die with the condition. \nWhile this has given her a better understanding of what's happening to her, it's also made her terrified of ending up in a nursing home. \n\"I have a terrible fear of going to a nursing home. It's very frightening and it haunts me,\" Pat said. \nWhen Ed describes the kind of experience Pat's mother had, it's easy to understand where her fear comes from. \n\"The thing about the nursing home is that when Pat's mum went into it, it was not a very good one in those days. You used to go there and all the ladies were sitting on potty chairs with no pants on. That's what Pat does not want to happen,\" he said. \nDespite Pat's fears, Ed cannot make any promises. One of the things all dementia carers are taught is never to promise a loved one that moving to a nursing home is out of the question. Conditions change — for example, the carer might become ill or the person with dementia may become too unwell or unsafe to manage at home. \nFor now, Ed says they can manage at home. Even though they both know things will get worse. \n\"All I can see is that it's not going to get any better for me. It's just going to get worse. It's something I'm finding very hard to cope with because it keeps coming,\" Pat said.
