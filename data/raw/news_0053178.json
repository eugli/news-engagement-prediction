GETTY IMAGES \nThe new America's Cup catamarans are 20 per cent smaller but 20 per cent faster than the giants that sailed in San Francisco in 2013 when Oracle defended the trophy in this foiling 72-footer. \nOracle released a video of Spence taking a tumble that saw him being swept back past the four knife-like edges of the foils and rudders. \nREAD MORE: â€” ORACLE TEAM USA (@OracleTeamUSA) February 23, 2017 \nIt was a huge moment of relief when the big Australian was spat out the back of the boat safely. \n\"You're very aware of everything that's around you,\" Spence said later. \n\"The four foils that are in the water with you, so I just kind of froze a little bit and was quite relieved to realise I was out the back of the boat.\" \nOracle skipper Jimmy Spithill said it was a nervous couple of seconds as they awaited Spence's fate in the water. Ad Feedback \n\"Any time someone goes over the front of one of these boats in any situation, the chances of not getting hit by the four appendages in the water are pretty slim,\" Spithill explained. \n\"It's a real fear. Any time you hear or someone go over the front, it's a real bad feeling. \n\"That time from when you see him go over the front to when you see him pop back up on the surface and give the thumbs up always takes too long.\" \nTeam France skipper Franck Cammas nearly had his right foot sliced off when he fell overboard in a training accident on their test boat in November 2015 and he hit one of the rudders. \nCammas needed extensive surgery to save the foot. He remains in charge of the French syndicate and will helm their boat in Bermuda. \nThe new America's Cup catamarans are 20 per cent smaller but 20 per cent faster than the 72-foot giants that sailed in San Francisco in 2013 when Oracle defended the trophy with their remarkable comeback against Team New Zealand. \nAll the teams are practicing extensive safety procedures. \nIn the buildup to the 2013 regatta Sweden's Artemis Racing suffered a training crash where crew member Andrew \"Bart\" Simpson was killed. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:02:42.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
