Eschenbach didn’t exactly usher in a new era for the NSO, but he hired a lot of new players, led a few stirring performances, and took the orchestra on several big tours. He also made a point of spotlighting principal players in solos with the orchestra.\nThursday night’s concert reflected what have come to be hallmarks of the Eschenbach years. It offered largely familiar repertoire, plus a concerto that gave a deserving principal player a moment in the limelight.\nIt also presented an uneven, but certainly distinctive, performance. And often, particularly in Beethoven’s Eighth Symphony,­ ­idiosyncratic though the reading may have been, everyone sounded as if they were having fun.\nAnd what is more fun than a trombone concerto? There’s something great about having a really loud instrument at the front of the stage, liberating the orchestra’s other sections from their usual obligatory restraint. In my opinion, the trombone generally doesn’t get enough time center stage, or enough respect for its urbane, mellow, golden sound, though it tends to make quite an impact when it does get a turn to come forward; this evening’s trombone concerto, by Christopher Rouse, won its composer the Pulitzer Prize in 1993.\nRouse has been steadily present on the orchestra scene throughout the years since, writing music that, like this concerto, is expressive, serious and often beautiful (the NSO will play his new organ concerto later this spring).\nAnd Craig Mulcahy, the orchestra’s principal trombone, played the piece with dignity, interspersing gleaming lines of sound with rapid passagework, from the moment when the notes woke from the depths of the timpani and the bottom of the trombone register, through a buildup that released the entire orchestra in controlled frenzy punctuated by several ­mallet-blows worthy of the Mahler Sixth, to the last bars when the sound subsided into quiet growling from the percussion and dark harp-plucks and a final springy, resonant, quiet chord, all underneath the trombone’s firm gold.\nEschenbach is a conductor who seeks to do things with the music, finding ways to put his stamp on it rather than letting it speak for itself.\nBoth the opening piece, Tchaikovsky’s “Serenade for Strings,” and the Beethoven suffered a little at the start from Eschenbach’s habit of plunging into the music in the middle of the stream, as it were, which sometimes means the players take a few moments to come bobbing up to the surface and orient themselves.\nBut once he had gotten past the clotted density of the first movement in the Tchaikovsky, he led a reading that was on the whole quite amiable. Similarly, the Beethoven, though sometimes a little repetitive and sometimes swayed with a grace that was more ponderous than dance-like, kept reclaiming itself in moments with a genuine lilt — music that brought a smile to one’s face.\nThere’s no arguing with that.\nThe program repeats Saturday night at 8.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:53:10.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
