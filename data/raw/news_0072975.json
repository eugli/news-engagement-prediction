They believe Rachel and Declan could be cared for elsewhere without them suffering, but there are no similar facilities in the city. Rachel Barton, 15, faces being moved from a specialist home in Salford because of council cuts \nRachel's mum Rebecca Howarth said her daughter’s life would change \"drastically\" if The Grange shuts. She led a protest outside Salford Civic Centre on Wednesday to try to stop the closure. \nShe said: “Rachel would find it very difficult being anywhere else. We have not been given any real options about her care elsewhere. \n“We don’t want her to go out of Salford. She’s very happy, very settled and is doing well there. \n“She would have to move home, move schools, be away from her family and see different health care professionals.” Read More Man's body found in city centre river \nRachel has complex needs, including autism, and suffers from and a rare genetic condition called tuberous sclerosis, which leads to tumours developing in different parts of the body. The youngster, who has been a full time resident at The Grange since summer 2014, also has epilepsy and learning difficulties. \n“Moving would have a massive impact,” said Rebecca, who is calling on people to support her and lobby the council for a U-turn. \n“We’ve spoken to the mayor and councillors and hopefully they’ll listen and they’ll reconsider. \n“Can you really put a figure on the impact for a severely disabled young person?” Rebecca Howarth is leading the campaign to save the home amid Salford City Council cuts (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nDeclan’s dad Andy said staff at The Grange \"are like magicians\" and have helped the teenager, who is autistic and has complex learning difficulties, completely turn his life around. \nHe has been at the home full time since October, but benefited from respite care there for six years before that. \n“He’s come on so much,” Andy added. “His speech has come on, he’s developed so much. The staff are amazing, he loves them. \n“The home is in an ideal location, close to his family, and I can’t imagine him being anywhere else.” Read More Parents stage protests alongside striking teachers at troubled primary school \nHe added: “The council might save £300,000, but that’s nothing in the grand scheme of things when Declan could be affected so badly. \nCity mayor Paul Dennett came out to speak to campaigners and had a \"decent\" conversation with them but the measure is being signed off as part of this year’s £16m cuts package . \nThe home was saved from closure in 2013 , but the majority of residents were moved to an adult home or put into foster care. Salford Mayor Paul Dennett spoke to protesters (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nCouncil bosses say the home is unsuitable for the two teenagers and that they can find facilities with more \"interactive and social environments\". \nBut the parents of Rachel and Declan say putting them in homes with an \"overwhelming\" number of other youngsters would not help because of their autism. \nLead member for children and young people’s services Coun Lisa Stone said bosses have Rachel and Declan’s \"best interests at heart\" and believe they can be cared for better elsewhere.
