Credit: Met Office Storm Doris is likely to cause travel disruption, damage buildings and send debris flying, forecasters have warned.\nSevere weather warnings have been put in place for much of the UK on Thursday, with people in the Border region urged to \"be prepared\".\nWinds of up to 80mph are expected to plague northern Scotland on Wednesday before Doris arrives from the Atlantic on Thursday, the Met Office said.\nYellow rain, wind and snow warnings are in force for Cumbria.\nThis means there is a danger of some localised flooding and travel disruption, as well as snow on higher ground, which will make for difficult driving conditions.\nGusts of 50-60mph are expected, with gusts of 70mph possible in coastal areas.\nAn Amber snow warning is in force in the south of Scotland, which is expected to disrupt transport and power supplies.\nYellow rain and wind warnings are also in place.\nWeather warnings are in force in the Border region. Credit: Met Office Storm Doris is expected to move on quickly, with the worst of the weather gone by Thursday evening.\nWhile further Atlantic gusts will bring more rain and wind through the weekend and into next week, they are not expected to reach the heights of Doris.\nStorms with the potential to cause substantial impact are named by the Met Office and Met Eireann, moving through the alphabet.\nThe first was named Abigail in November 2015, after members of the public suggested monikers for the \"name our storms\" project.\nForecasters are now in their second run through the alphabet. After Doris, Britons can expect to hear of Ewan, Fleur and Gabriel.\nStorm Doris's appearance contrasts with Monday's temperatures, where visitors to Kew Gardens, west London, enjoyed the warmest day of the winter so far, at 18.3C (64.9F).\n Weather Cumbria Scotland", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:47:50.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
