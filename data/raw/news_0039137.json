Ouch. \nBut in true Bachelor style, that’s not all! A very familiar face makes an entrance on next week’s episode and forces him to come face-to-face with his past: enter former Bachelorette star Andi Dorfman . \n“Hello Nick,” says Dorfman — who chose Josh Murray over Viall when she starred on season 10 of the ABC reality series — when he opens the door to his hotel room. \nThe Bachelor airs Mondays (8 p.m. ET) on ABC.
