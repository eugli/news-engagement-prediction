More recently, Jamie Spaniolo and Paul Methric dropped their The Continuous Evilution of Life’s ?’s album and spoke with HipHopDX during their LA tour stop. \nDuring our conversation with the rambunctious duo, the two talked about their status as unknown knowns within Hip Hop and their storied career, which once saw them signed to Insane Clown Posse ‘s Psychopathic Records. “We refuse to lose and every other day we find a new way to win,” said Spaniolo. \n“I think it challenges us musically to continue to keep going in directions of stuff that we might not normally be comfortable for,” Methric continued. “We always want to raise the bar. That say no attitude, we don’t know about it.” \nThe Continuous Evilution of Life’s ?’s features the single “Dead And Gone (Unh-Stop)” which DX premiered on the site last month. \nThough the two never crossed over into mainstream, there were a few significant moments like their guest appearance on Three 6 Mafia ’s When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1 album on the track “Just Another Crazy Click” alongside ICP. \n“I wanna say at the time, it was pretty cool of them,” Methric said. “They were doing the wicked shit. It was kind of risky of them at the time. More for them 100 percent. We didn’t give a fuck, we were the scumbags. For them to fuck with the scumbags, it was props to Three 6. They’ll always have a special little ventricle in our heart.” \nHowever, Twiztid also discussed how horrorcore artists including Three 6, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and even Eminem transitioned to more mainstream notoriety. \n“I think they found their niche and that’s what it was,” Methric said. They might have started off somewhere. Listen to the first Bone EP Faces of Death and they were on some wicked shit. Next thing you know they’re singing about Uncle Charles. It did take off though because to me, the biggest MC in the world [Eminem] is a wicked rapper. He kicks the wicked shit. It’s just he was created through the mainstream, we were not and what the mainstream doesn’t create, it doesn’t understand. They either take a chance and see what it’s about or they just shun it like they want nothing to do with it. I believe everything they’ve said about them is true and good enough for me.” \nAlongside the tour for The Continuous Evilution of Life’s ?’s , the two have much planned this year including a limited edition soda, 11 album releases on their Majik Ninja Entertainment label and annual 4/20 celebration concert.
