Gabas held his hands to his left eye, as he began to come to terms with what had transpired. \nThe Frenchman iced the wound but could not continue and had no option but to disqualify Wimbledon boys' champion Shapovalov. \nGabas was being taken to Ottawa General Hospital for a precautionary evaluation. \nCanadian team-mate Vasek Pospisil insisted on Twitter that the outburst was out of character for Shapovalov. External Link: @VasekPopisil: No one is nicer or carries themselves better for a 17 yo than Shapovalov. Everyone can see that today was an accident. Can happen to anyone\" \nEdmund had taken the first two sets 6-3, 6-4 and seemed on the way to victory in the third when everyone inside the arena was shocked by the sudden turn of events. \n\"It is a surprise what happened at the end there and it is a shame,\" Britain's captain Leon Smith told the BBC. \n\"I feel for the young lad. He's a great talent and he has learned a harsh lesson. External Link: @DavisCup: \"Chair umpire Arnaud Gabas has brusing & swelling of the left eye. He is going to Ottawa General Hospital for precautionary evaluation\" \n\"But Kyle, from what we saw on Friday to today, was fantastic. How he prepared, how he took command, his unbelievable serving and he kept pressure on the turns. It was a great performance.\" \nThe win capped a fine comeback for Britain, who had come into the day leading 2-1 before Pospisil levelled the world group first round tie with a 7-6 6-4 3-6 7-6 win over Dan Evans. \nThe victory means Britain will head to France for a quarter-final tie scheduled for April 7-9 \nReuters/ABC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T14:22:44.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
