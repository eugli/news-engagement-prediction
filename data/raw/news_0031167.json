The next day Raphela authorised a special payment request for the upfront payment, which she released on December 12. \nThe company is headed by Muthe Rambuwani, who won Standard Bank's Rising Star award in 2014. \nRambuwani declined to discuss his contract with the SABC, or his VAT payment. \n\"I'm not going to comment on any of that,\" he said before cutting the call. \nHe also failed to respond to detailed questions sent by SMS. \nSARS spokesman Sandile Memela said that anyone who \"wilfully and without just cause\" failed to register for VAT faced a prison sentence of up to two years. \nThe SABC's end-of-year splurge took place while a parliamentary committee was holding an inquiry into mismanagement at the broadcaster. \nIn an interim report released on January 27, the committee highlighted the financial cost of flouting governance and procurement rules. The report warned of a \"looming financial crisis\" that had left the SABC \"at risk of becoming technically insolvent\". \nTreasury rules allow state entities to deviate from normal procurement processes, such as competitive bidding or sourcing three quotes, if there is an unforeseen emergency or it can be proved that a company is the sole provider of a product or service. \nSABC sources said this was not the case with the suspect contracts and payments, the timing of which was suspicious. \n\"Why would it be necessary to do deviations in December when everyone's going on holiday?\" said one. \n\"And why would you pay upfront when there's nobody working?\" \nAnother company that benefited from the SABC's festive season rush to pay suppliers contracted without tendering or required procedure being followed was SekelaXabiso. \nIronically, the auditing firm was contracted to deal with irregular expenditure findings by the auditor-general that had amounted to R5-billion by the end of the 2016 financial year. \nThe firm was flagged by the parliamentary report under the heading \"Suspicious transactions\" because of what appeared to be irregularities in the awarding of contracts in the past two years. \nMost of the contracts were signed by former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng and acting CEO James Aguma. \nThe Times previously reported that Aguma had authorised irregular payments of R10-million to auditing firm PwC and awarded a lucrative contract to debt collection company Lorna Vision without inviting tenders. \nLorna Vision and PwC were also both flagged in the parliamentary report. \nThe report quotes \"oral evidence\" by the SABC's former head of procurement, Madoda Shushu, who said there was no justification for deviating from normal supply chain rules for the Lorna Vision contract. \n\"This contract did not meet the requirements of a deviation,\" he said. \nEarly in December former SABC group executive for risk and governance Itani Tseisi told the parliamentary inquiry that contracts were awarded to SekelaXabiso \"with little regard for supply-chain management regulations\". \nDespite Tseisi's warning, Raphela signed a new nine-month contract with Sekela- Xabiso worth R9.8-million on December 23.
