Ad Feedback \n\"At the same time, banks now are facing a changing dynamic around the increasing volume and cost of international funding needed to meet local lending requirements. With levels of local deposits failing to keep pace with the amount of lending banks are doing, the increased use of offshore funding has increased funding costs, reducing our net interest margin.\" \nShe said there had been pressure on funding costs as off-shore borrowing became more expensive due to increasing volatility in international markets. \nShe said interest rate costs were likely to rise over the next 12 months as banks had to go off-shore for funding because customers wanted to borrow more than they wanted to deposit with the bank. \n\"We have to go off-shore to hedge the gap,\" she said. \nThat increase in costs could be expected to flow through to retail rates. \nCommentators have said banks are getting tougher with their lending criteria, particularly for lending to property developers and investors. \nChapman said the bank wanted to support customers but was also looking at deals closely because there was such demand for money. \nShe said the result was a solid one for ASB. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:05:58.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
