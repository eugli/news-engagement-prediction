The owners bought for $545,000 in August, 2011. Source: Supplied \nHouse prices in the once-thriving mining town have plummeted at an eye-watering pace, taking the fortunes of many a mum and dad investor with them. \nAs seemingly every month, we hear housing affordability in Melbourne and Sydney has moved further from the grasp of the working and middle classes, those in the mining towns are left with mortgages that can be as much as triple the value of their homes. \nPiles of red dust rendered virtually valueless.

Picture: Robyne Cuerel Source: News Limited \nOne Moranbah house that sold for $589,000 as the boom was still climbing to its peak in September 2011, sold through mortgagee auction in November for just $118,000. \nOver in the iron ore centre of Port Hedland, in Western Australia’s north, it’s a similar story. \nA three bedroom 1960s home in the town centre, once earmarked as a development site when accommodation was in chronically short supply, sold to a first homebuyer in October for $235,000. \nJust four years ago, in November, 2012, it commanded $1600 per week in rent. The following year it was listed for sale for just under $1.1 million. \nMorag Lowe, principal of First National Hedland Real Estate, said no-one expected the prices of the boom to last. \nBut, equally, no-one expected the speed of the crash. While the astronomical house prices of the mining boom were never expected to last, the speed of the Port Hedland property crash shocked those who lived there. Source: AFP \n“A lot of people have been caught out, people very experienced in real estate were also caught out,” she said. \n“I think everyone in our town knew the abnormally high prices were not sustainable into the future and saw it as a windfall or bonus. \n“What we didn’t see was how quickly the downturn happened and the enormity of it. \n“We might have expected a period of adjustment, maybe a 10 to 20 per cent drop in value but the world seemed to change overnight. \nMs Exposito echoed similar sentiments. \n“We went to bed with the high of the boom and then woke up in the downturn,” she said. \nBoth women have been forced to watch, again and again, as everyday people endure the heartbreak of declaring bankruptcy. \n“We’re seeing mortgagee sales and not an insignificant number,” Ms Lowe said. \n“It’s absolutely horrendous but don’t make the mistake of thinking this is just something typical of mining towns. \n“I have an apartment in Perth I bought around height of demand six years ago when I was getting $680 per week rent. \n“Now, it’s down to $480. In fact, I’m talking to an agent today and it’s on the market.” 23 Flight Drive in Moranbah sold for just $118,000 in November, 2016, five years after it sold for $589,000. Source: Supplied \nLikewise, Ms Exposito bought a home in the central Queensland city of Mackay for $560,000 in 2013 that has recently been valued at $300,000. \nBoth cities had property booms due to their proximity to mining towns and subsequent downturns in the crash. \nMs Lowe said everyone knew the construction phase, that which saw thousands more people flood to the west and mining companies paying once-in-a-lifetime wages, would end. \nWhat they did not anticipate was that it would coincide with a dramatic plunge in Chinese demand for iron ore — an appetite that had once seemed insatiable — meaning a free fall in the resource price and mass job losses. \nShe said that the lessons of the West Australian market crashes are equally applicable to those on the eastern seaboard, in that, economically speaking, no-one can ever predict what is on the horizon. Morag Lowe, principal of First National Hedland Real Estate, says the fall in prices was faster and bigger than anyone expected.

Windfall was the word we used but we genuinely did not see the drop being so sudden.” \nThe director of economic forecaster BIS Shrapnel, Robert Mellor, said east coast property owners should not be fooled into thinking they are immune from downturns in property prices, albeit any corrections there are not expected to be quite so dramatic. \nMr Mellor said rapid property price rises could not be sustained due to the cyclic nature of the economy. This house in Sydney’s eastern suburbs sold at auction for $800,000 more than its reserve price. Source: Supplied \nThose who have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars above the value of their property in competitive markets such as Sydney would likely see a drop in the value of their homes in the next few years, he said. \n“People who have bought off the plan and those who have paid clearly inflated premiums for established homes will suffer most,” he said. \n“Those who have bought 10 to 20 per cent more than a property was anticipated to go for, might suffer a 10 per cent loss in 12 months time.” \nMr Mellor said interest rates were unlikely to rise, which would head off the threat of substantial mortgagee auctions in the major cities. \nHowever, he said in the climate of heavy borrowing to meet escalating prices, there was one sector of mortgage holders who were particularly vulnerable to any upward movement in interest rates from their current historic lows. \n“Particularly people doing interest only payments, everything for them is predicated on price growth, their investment strategy is going in for price growth,” he said. \n“They may even be started to be affected by a small movement in interest rates, so they could find themselves getting into trouble.” \nHe said investors looking to sell in the next couple of years would likely lose money if they had not had their property long, he said. \n“These abnormally buoyant conditions are not going to be sustained,” he said. \n“Perth is a good example. Perth house prices dropped by 10 per cent, thanks largely to an oversupplied market. Source: News Corp Australia \n“Prices there are down 10 per cent since December 2014, which just highlights you do not need rising interest rates to bring about a correction. \n“All you need is too much supply coming on stream, which, in Perth’s case was houses. \n“A 10 per cent correction by historical standards is a fairly substantial decrease. \n“Even in previous recessions, it’s been rare for prices to fall more than five per cent.” \nBrisbane apartment investors, and to a lesser extent their counterparts in Melbourne, are particularly at risk of heavy losses, he said, due to oversupply. \nHe said while the Melbourne market had shown unexpected resilience, Brisbane was in a free fall that could continue into 2020. Brisbane apartment prices are predicted to continue falling for at least three years. Picture: Glenn Hunt Source: News Corp Australia \nIn other markets, such as Sydney, he expected the price falls to start in late 2017 and continue into 2018. \n“What you are seeing in sales activity is a market that is heavily driven by investors and that’s potentially unsustainable,” he said. \n“The prices they are paying are over the top. A year ago I would have said the market was flattening out, and there was not a significant risk of price decline in Sydney, but if the latest data is correct, there is a risk the price correction later this year and into 2018 could be in the field of 10 per cent.” \nThe investor market is one both Moranbah’s Ms Exposito and Port Hedland’s Ms Lowe know only too well. \nWhile the risks of investing in mining towns always carried higher risks than those investing in capital cities, both say there has been a silver lining in having investors abandon their towns. Moranbah Real Estate Proprietor Bella Exposito says owner-occupiers are returning. Source: News Limited \nLong-term residents of the town who were either previously priced out of the market or who sold up at the peak of the boom to capitalise on the opportunity and left town, are now able to enter or re-enter the market. \nThe vast majority of houses sold in both towns are now made to owner-occupiers, predominantly first home buyers. \n“We are selling everything we have under $200,000,” Ms Exposito said. \n“A lot of our younger ones are purchasing property back in Moranbah.” \nIn Port Hedland, Ms Lowe said a feeling of optimism is returning. 23 Moore Street in Port Hedland once commanded $1600 per week in rent. It was listed for sale in June 2013 for just under $1.1 million and sold for $235,000 last October. Source: Supplied \n“I think that it’s a feeling we have hit the bottom and that some of the shoots of recovery are starting to be seen in the local economy,” she said. \nWhile the halcyon, beg-spending days of the boom are long gone, and the population of the town has almost halved, there remains plenty of mining jobs on offer as it transitions away from the construction phase and into the export phase. \nAnd that is good news for those who call Port Hedland home. \n“There is still a heck of a lot of activity in this town,” she said. \n“We have 22 properties under contract at the moment, the majority going to owner-occupiers. \n“There’s been an absolute turnaround for first home buyers and local residents. \n“If you can adjust to life in these remote mining towns, you can have a very comfortable lifestyle. \n“If you are in employment you are still going to be earning significantly more than you would in metropolitan areas. \n“No-one would ever have wanted this, absolutely no-one, but part of the nature of these towns is they are very resilient.” In West Australian mining town Karratha, 2/81 Nickol Road, built in 2002, sold for $890,000 in February, 2011. In December, 2015, it sold for less than half that price, $415,000.
