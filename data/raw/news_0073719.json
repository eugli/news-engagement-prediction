While that was a science fiction, the latest discovery by the Belgian telescope TRAPPIST and NASA’s Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescopes is science fact. \nNASA \nA group of seven earth-size rocky planets, orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star, named the TRAPPIST-1 system is probably the most important space find of recent times. In May 2016, TRAPPIST had discovered three planets in the system. Later, the Spitzer telescope discovered that the third planet was, in fact, three different planets and it also found two more in addition. What makes TRAPPIST-1 special? \nThe TRAPPIST-1 system is of particular interest to scientists because this is the first time that Earth-size planets have been found orbiting this kind of a star. Observations made so far have confirmed that these are rocky in nature, just like the inner planets of our solar system. \nNASA \nThe stars orbit is very near to their star, in fact all of them are closer to it than Mercury is to our very own sun. Interestingly, since the star is an ultra-cool dwarf, there’s a good chance of liquid water existing on the surface of the planets, despite the close orbit. \nEven more important is the fact that three out of the seven are located in the habitable zone. This means three times the chances of alien life existing there. But does it? \nNobody is certain about it. Not yet. Water is a pre-requisite for life to exist, so there’s a good chance it might evolve in the future. The habitable zone is that region around a star, where temperatures aren’t really too high or too cold, but just right so liquid water can exist. The earth orbits in the habitable zone and here we are - all alone in the universe. \nNASA \nTo be certain, however, NASA is going to utilise the James Webb Space Telescope to detect the chemicals that exist there, including water, oxygen, ozone, methane and others. So how earth-like are they? \nAll the seven planets in the system are between 0.77 to 1.09 times the radius of the earth, so they’re pretty much as big as the earth. But since they are so close to their star, if you were there, you’d be celebrating your birthday every 1.5 to 20 earth days!
