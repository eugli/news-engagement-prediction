Vouchers return, increased in value \nToday NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner bowed to pressure and announced the tradies vouchers would return, and extended to up to $4,000 for people who had not yet accessed the scheme. \n\"In listening and acting and responding sometimes you've got to put the Territory first and pride second,\" Mr Gunner said. \n\"We have listened, we have acted, we are bringing back the tradies' scheme bigger and better.\" \nFor those who had used a voucher already, they could apply to use another $2,000. \nUnder the new plan up to 50 per cent of the money in the voucher can be spent on materials. \nMr Gunner said $7.5 million was still available from the existing scheme, and the Government would borrow money to increase the pool available for the scheme to $15 million. \nBut he said he believed Labor would still meet another election promise, to return the budget to surplus by 2019/20. \nLast month a CommSec report showed business spending in the NT was down 38.3 per cent in the September quarter compared to the decade average, while housing finance was 25 per cent lower. Policy reversal 'the right decision' \nMr Gunner said the NT Government had already fast-tracked $120 million in infrastructure spending and introduced a 30 per cent buy local program. \n\"I have listened to the feedback and taken the decision to not only extend the Home Improvement Scheme, but to significantly boost it so that we have a raft of programs to support business,\" Mr Gunner said in a statement. \nNT Chamber of Commerce acting chief executive Brian O'Gallagher said the policy reversal was the right decision. \n\"It's pretty wet out there and pretty damp, but that hasn't stopped the Chief Minister and his government delivering a lot of sunshine to our small business community today,\" he said. \nBuilder Tristan McCulloch also spoke at Mr Gunner's press conference and said the extended scheme would allow him to stay in the Territory. \n\"I was looking at other states and trying to find work in other areas and trying to find other types of ways to make money because the money just wasn't coming in from building work,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:16:01.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
