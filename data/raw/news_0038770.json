It was his wildly popular hit single ‚ÄúYou're a Lady\", which reached number three in the UK Singles Chart in 1972, that brought him into the limelight.\nThree years later, he again made it into the charts with the song \"Hold On to Love\" which reached number 14. Skellern was best known for his love songs and ballads which drew on old folk traditions.\nHe continued to make records on and off throughout the 1970s and 1980s but spent more energy honing his career as a stage writer and composing scores for musicals.\nMore recently, Skellern has been writing choral music, including \"Waiting for the Word\", which was written for the BBC's Songs of Praise programme, Six Simple Carols and The Nativity Cantata written for a Hemel Hempstead choir called the Aeolian Singers.\nPeople have paid tribute to the singer on Twitter.\n\"A sad day today.
