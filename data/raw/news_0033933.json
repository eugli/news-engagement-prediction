That press conference got moved to Wednesday. Then on Tuesday night, it was canceled altogether. \nWoods released the following statement. After receiving daily treatment the last several days on his on-going back spasms, Tiger Woods has again been advised by doctors to limit all activities and will not hold a press conference Wednesday. It will not be rescheduled. \nWoods effectively withdrew from a press conference with a bad back. After his WD in Dubai two weeks ago with back spasms, which led to him pulling out of this week's tournament as well as next week's Honda Classic , the future is not a bright one for Woods. \nWhat will be fascinating now is to see when he plays again. Will he be ready for the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March, or will he wait until the Masters in April? Is he done for good? \nThe prevailing emotion I find myself drawn to when it comes to all things Woods, especially at an event where he is supposed to be host and we are supposed to celebrate the 25-year anniversary of his first appearance at a PGA Tour event, is profound sadness. \nSadness that he will never be the same. Sadness that he can't even try to be 50 percent of what he used to be. Sadness that I'm not totally 100 percent sure we will see him finish four rounds at a tournament this year. Everyone ages out of sports eventually, but this was not how this was supposed to go.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:54:04.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
