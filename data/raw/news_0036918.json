This volume, however, presents a lesser-known side of Valeri’s genius through a dazzlingly erudite set of comparative essays on core topics in the history of anthropological theory. Offering masterly discussions of anthropological thought about ritual, fetishism, cosmogonic myth, belief, caste, kingship, mourning, play, feasting, ceremony, and cultural relativism, Classic Concepts in Anthropology , presented here with a critical foreword by Rupert Stasch and Giovanni da Col, will be an eye-opening, essential resource for students and researchers not only in anthropology but throughout the humanities. \nReview Quotes Marcos P. D. Lanna, Universidade Federal de São Carlos “A great and unique master. . . . Valeri had an ability for amazement and wonder that came from a practice of ethnography which, rather than being a nominalist search for historical details, looked to life itself as a source of percepts as well as a producer of concepts.” Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney, University of Wisconsin–Madison “Any superlative diminishes Valeri and his scholarship, which is characterized by rich, subtle, and complex ethnographic and historical information, underscored by theoretical rigor based on extensive fieldwork.” For more information, or to order this book, please visit http://www.press.uchicago.edu Google preview here", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:38:46.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
