Give up our rights or go to jail. Now, give up our water or go to jail. We are not criminals.\" URGENT.My friends in Standing Rock just sent this to me & asked me to share it. They are surrounded by militarized police RIGHT NOW. pic.twitter.com/plR0Tfaagc — Shaun King (@ShaunKing) February 21, 2017 \nSince construction of the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) was greenlighted last year, water protectors have been protesting how it will rip through sacred indigenous land and burial sites, disrupting access to clean water. In December, the announcement that the Army’s civil works department would not approve the easement required for construction of DAPL seemed like a glimmer of good news to protectors. Less than a week into office, however, President Trump ordered construction to start back up, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers and governor of North Dakota issued an order for those in the Oceti Sakowin Camp to evacuate by Wednesday, Feb. 22. \nIn the video, women say they are at risk of facing arrests, police brutality, federal charges, and prison time. King's tweet also says they are currently surrounded by militarized police. Since Feb. 15, according to the Oceti Sakowin website, there has also been a \"soft-blockade\" in place that only allows emergency vehicles through the camp. \nFor those wanting to know how to get involved, the Oceti Sakowin has listed a number of actions on its site, from calling senators and oil company executives to donating supplies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:24:45.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
