Follow our live scoring updates here. Devonta Freeman (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:15 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:15 p.m. ET \nSuper Bowl 51 between the Patriots and Falcons promised two things based on Vegas oddsmakers' projections: a close game, perÂ the three-point spread Â in New England's favor, which would be out of the ordinary for the 2016-17 NFL playoffs ... and points, perÂ the over/under point total of 59 , a Super Bowl record. \nLIVE SCOREBOARD: Super Bowl 51Â updates \nOK, nothing was promised. New England wasÂ looking for its fifth SuperÂ Bowl championship of the legendary Tom Brady-Bill Belichick era. Atlanta set out to earn its first Super Bowl title in franchise history on its second try. ThoseÂ teams knew better than anybody thatÂ nothing was promised. \nTwo full weeks of micro-analysis had everybody beyond ready for Super Bowl 51. All the storylines â many of which were overrated Â â culminated right before kickoff. The NFL's top scoring defense vs. its top scoring offense. Tom Brady vs. Matt Ryan . Tom Brady vs. commissioner Roger Goodell. Julio Jones vs. the Patriots secondary. Chances are you were tired of the analytical nonsense and ready for the game itself. \nWe were, too. \nSN NFL writers David Steele, Vinnie Iyer and Alex Marvez all predicted a New England victory Â in Super Bowl 51. That was bad news to the majority of the country, which based on who-do-you-want-to-win poll results Â wanted Atlanta to interrupt its opponent'sÂ dynasty. The Patriots fatigue is real. \nSporting News is providing live Patriots-FalconsÂ updates during Sunday's Super Bowl. Follow along here. \nâ \n8:03 p.m. ET : Halftime ... aka Lady Gaga time. AtlantaÂ dominated the first half of the Super Bowl and punished Tom Brady in the process. \nBrady finished the first half 15 of 25 for 179 yards and one interception, which was returned for a touchdown, plus a couple sacks â a rating of 66.8. His QB counterpart, Matt Ryan, had no such bad luck through the first 30 minutes. The Falcons quarterback completed seven of his eight passes for 115 yards and a touchdown, a perfect rating of 158.3. He became the first quarterback ever to maintain a perfect passer rating through halftime of a Super Bowl. \nThe key for Atlanta in the first half was the pressure it was able to put on Brady, most of which was generated without aÂ blitz. The Falcons' secondary also played well in its man coverage scheme on the outside, supplemented by a zone in the middle, short part of the field. \nThe Patriots, who dominated first-half time of possession, 19:35 to 10:25, also maintained an edge in total yards, 210-189. The Patriots ran 42 plays in the first half compared to the Falcons' 19. \nDevonta Freeman easily was the game's leading rusher at halftime, with his 71 yards on six carries and a touchdown to boot. . @AtlantaFalcons head into the locker room with an 18-point lead! #RiseUp #SB51 pic.twitter.com/1Rrk2jhhTO â NFL (@NFL) February 6, 2017 \n8:02 p.m. ET â field goal : New England's first points of the game came in disappointing fashion. A potential touchdown drive was ruined when tight end Martellus Bennett was called for holding during a run that would have given the Pats a first down inside the Falcons' 10-yard line. The New England drive ended up lasting 10 plays and went 52 yards. 21-3, Falcons. \n7:57 p.m. ET : Atlanta's De'Vondre Campbell was ruled questionable to return with cramps. \n7:44 p.m. ET â touchdown : Tom Brady made a big, big, big mistake. His pass intended for Danny Amendola on a rub route was read perfectly and picked off by Atlanta cornerbackÂ Robert Alford, whoÂ returned it 82 yards for a touchdown. It wasÂ devastating for the Patriots not only because they had driven 52 yards in 12 plays to get near the red zone, but the pick occurred with just over two minutes to play in the half. It was the first time Brady had thrownÂ a pick six in the postseason.Â 21-0, Falcons. đ¨đ¨ PICK-6 ALERT! đ¨đ¨ @rockorocky takes TB12's pass 82 yards the OTHER WAY! #SB51 #RiseUp https://t.co/F3zp4FUYva", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:34:26.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
