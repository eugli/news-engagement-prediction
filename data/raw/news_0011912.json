Article continues below \nHowever, Holm told MMAFighting.com that she doesn't think she broke Rousey, which is something her coach has said, but admitted that taking a loss like Rousey did against Holm does affect a fighter's mind: \n“It’s really hard to tell your mind differently,” she said. “Your mind is very powerful, and I think that that wouldn’t have happened if I didn’t already knock her out before, because her mind had been there. If her and Nunes fought before Ronda and I fought, I do feel like that fight would have gone longer than it did. I really do. And I don’t think anybody would argue with me on that. So with that being said, who knows if Ronda’s really done or not. Maybe she’ll come back in the future. Maybe she just needs a little time to really take time off. I know she just had a year off, but it was a year off and back into a title fight. \n“I guess I don’t really feel like I broke her, but I do know that coming off of a knockout, when I knocked her out, yes — that helped the fight with Nunes [end] faster. I don’t mean that in any rude way.” \nHolm knows what she's talking about, having lost both of her fights since defeating Rousey. However, she'll hop back in the octagon at UFC 208 in Brooklyn next weekend.
