Some of those supplies will move to a new, smaller location over the next several days, said Tom Waldeck, president and CEO of Keep Phoenix Beautiful, which operates the project.\nA lawsuit over the parcel and a pending change in ownership ended the several-year run of the PHX Renews site. Garden beds and non-profit programs transformed the land owned by Barron Collier Cos. that sat vacant for decades.\nThe company ended an agreement to let people use the property as it prepares to settle litigation and transfer the site to the federal government. Leaders including U.S. Sen. John McCain and Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton lobbied the Department of the Interior for the authorization to stay.\nBut organizers never heard back from the department, Waldeck said. Some people will move to a new garden project at 19th Avenue and Pierson Street. Other groups are displaced and looking for land.\nIt's unclear what's next for the parcel. Barron Collier Cos. directed all questions to the Department of the Interior. A department spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment by Tuesday afternoon.\nIt’s possible the site could reopen to gardeners on a smaller scale, if the federal government grants permission. But after a failed rush to save the project, Keep Phoenix Beautiful also is looking forward to revitalizing other parts of the city, Waldeck said.\n“Once the shock and awe is over with, this really excites me,” he said.\nPHX Renews to move to 19th Avenue Some gardeners will get a new home just south of the light-rail line on Pierson Street. Work will start next week to convert a blighted lot into a community space.\nREAD MORE: \nPhoenix community garden seeks federal reprieve to avoid shutdown\nCrews will demolish two abandoned houses and clear weeds and piles of junk on the neighborhood lot. The landscape architect who designed the original PHX Renews project will help develop a plan to include shipping containers, garden beds and a solar house designed by Arizona State University, Waldeck said.\nOwner VIVO Development Partners purchased the land several months ago and has no immediate plans for it, development partner Jose Pombo said. The company was working to make the abandoned homes more secure for neighbors when it heard PHX Renews had to move.\n\"It made sense,\" Pombo said. \"It was something we welcomed completely.\"\nKeep Phoenix Beautiful signed a three-year lease, Waldeck said. Gardeners will receive a 90-day notice to leave if the site is developed, though the goal is to have a community garden included in the final plans, he said.\nWaldeck sees benefits to the new site, which is less than an acre. It’s only a few miles from the original gardens, and located near a school. The smaller scale is more manageable for Keep Phoenix Beautiful, he said.\nBut land costs are higher at the new site, which also requires new garden beds and security fencing. Keep Phoenix Beautiful will seek help with donations and volunteers to open by early to midsummer.\nStanton said in a statement that he was disappointed by the Department of the Interior, but that he believes the new garden will be “another inspiring success story.”\nRefugee farmers look for new land PHX Renews gardeners are planning a new garden at 1822 W.

Others might restart at places like Roosevelt Growhouse, which is moving within downtown after losing its original location .\nBut the change will put a strain on some organizations.\nSome non-profits will follow PHX Renews. Health and wellness organization NATIVE HEALTH, for example, will start a new traditional garden after dismantling its plots on Central Avenue, Communications Coordinator Susan Levy said.\nNATIVE HEALTH is looking ahead, but the loss was tough, Levy said. The previous location was significant for its proximity to the organization and for its history as the former Phoenix Indian School.\nThe group is interested in opening again there if the federal government grants permission.\n“It’s pretty heartbreaking,” Levy said.\nThe International Rescue Committee would also want to move back, Development Manager Nicky Walker said. Refugee farmers grew food there to sell at farmers markets for extra income, and as a way to integrate into the community.\nFarmers likely have already lost out on this produce season, Walker said. Even those who find other land soon wouldn’t start growing immediately.\nThe organization will relocate some refugees to other gardens, but not all are as close to public transit as PHX Renews, Walker said. The farmers grow food at a scale well beyond the planters proposed at the new site.\nThe committee is looking for leads on irrigated land. Apart from the original PHX Renews garden, though, that’s a rarity in the heart of Phoenix.\n“We don’t have a lot of answers for them at this point,” Walker said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:45:29.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
