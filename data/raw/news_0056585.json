Slot to 247Sports Links \nFormer Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney could soon own a piece of one of the most successful sports franchises in the world. According to a report by Jon Heyman of FanRag Sports , Romney and his eldest son are putting together a bid for a small percentage of the New York Yankees. \nMitt and Tagg Romney and family are bidding to buy a small stake in the Yankees months after their try for the Marlins stalled. \nTheyâ€™re expected to pay $25 million to $30 million per point and thought to be interested in one or two points. The Yankees are valued around $3 billion or more. \nThe Romneys are said to have offered $1.4 billion many months back to buy the Miami Marlins. But that appears to be off the table now, as the Romneys are talking about buying a very small piece of the Yankees instead. \nRomney has previously shown interest in the Marlins and Dodgers but both of those pursuits came up empty. The 69-year-old has previous experience in sports management, having served as CEO of the organizing committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
