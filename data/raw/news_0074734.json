In the initial sessions of the budget hearing in Kerala assembly, he said, \"To ensure deterrence, my government will set up a sex offenders’ registry, which will maintain all identification details of sex offenders. It will be kept in the public domain. A comprehensive victim relief fund and a special department for women’s safety will be formed accordingly.\" \nManeka Gandhi, the Cabinet minister of Union for Women and Child development has been repeatedly reminding the government of a need for such initiative. According to a report by The News Minute , the governor stated in his address, \"All necessary measures shall be taken to uphold safety and security to their lives. Let me assure this house that my government shall not pardon any action from anyone that is calculated to be an affront to women. My government has already heralded a new policy and created history by deciding to create a separate department for women which is in the final stage of operationalism. Taking such exemplary policies to the next level, my government will set up all women police stations at the taluk levels. My government has already started the first women battalion this year and is committed to increase women’s share in the force to 15% and believe it should be 50%. Homes under Nirbhaya cell will be modernised and upgraded.\" \nThis announcement is getting traction in the context of the news of a popular film actress molested and sexually assaulted in Kochi, in a moving car. Away from this official announcement by the government, there also have been some significant people-led efforts to bring pressure on the central government to formulate such thing. On account of it, there have been more than 59,000 signatures to vote for a petition to take action against sex offenders, by change.org \nThis is a much needed initiative to curb the increasing cases of violence against women and it is interesting to see other states in the country and the governments taking it up as well. \nDo you have an interesting story to share?
