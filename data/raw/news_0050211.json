The author, who voted today during BMC polls, posted a picture of an extremely obese police personnel, and wrote: “Heavy police bandobast in Mumbai today.” The tweet backfired at Shobhaa as Mumbai Police immediately issued a demolishing response to the author. Mumbai police tweeted: “We love puns too Ms De but this one is totally misplaced. Uniform/official not ours. We expect better from responsible citizens like you.” It seemed that the personnel, whose picture was tweeted by Shobha, didn’t belong to Mumbai police. This fiasco once again led to immense Twitter trolling of De, who was earlier trolled for mocking Indian athletes at Rio Olympics and advising EAM Sushma Swaraj to tweet ‘less’.
