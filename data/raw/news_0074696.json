Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email It was the biggest gaffe in Oscars history - a feat that hasn't been repeated in the 88 year academy's history.\nAnd as the conspiracy theories flood the internet - from the astonishing to the believable - it has emerged that Warren Beatty, who made the epic error with Faye Dunaway, refused to hand over the wrong envelope to producers after he burst backstage.\nAccording to Vanity Fair , Oscars stage manager Gary Natoli approached Beatty after the gaffe, politely asking: \"Security would like the envelopes, Mr. Beatty.\"\nWarren and Fay as they prepare to read the wrong name (Photo: AFP) (Photo: Twitter/Barry Jenkins) \"I'm holding onto them,\" Beatty said. \"I'll give them to Barry Jenkins [Moonlight director] at an appropriate moment.\"\nOscars producer Jennifer Todd was also heard speaking to a crew member: “But how did they both read the wrong thing?”\nThe cnew detail comes as the UK wakes up the biggest fail in the Oscars history. As the stage was filled by stars Emma Stone , Ryan Gosling and producers Fred Berger and Marc Platt began their acceptance speeches, members of the Oscars crew were seen running across the back of the stage.\nMoonlight wins Best Picture at Oscars after EPIC mix up when La La Land is announced as winner\n(Photo: REUTERS) (Photo: AFP) Producer Jordan Horowitz then appeared and told a stunned crowd: \"There's a mistake. Moonlight you guys won best picture. This is not a joke, Moonlight you won best picture. Moonlight best picture.\"\nHorowitz added: \"This is no joke I'm afraid they read the wrong thing.\"\n(Photo: AFP) Horowitz then held up a card towards the camera showing Moonlight had won best picture while the film's cast and crew were shown hugging in jubilation.\nA visibly shocked Kimmel intervened, saying: \"This is very unfortunate what happened,\" before joking: \"Personally I blame Steve Harvey\" in a not-so-veiled reference to Harvey announcing the wrong winner at Miss Universe in 2015.\nBerger said: \"I'm going to be really proud to hand this to my friends to Moonlight\" and hugged the film's star Mahershala Ali.\n(Photo: Getty Images North America) (Photo: REUTERS) So, how exactly did such a monumental screw up happen?\nAt first, Kimmel blamed Beatty, turning to the veteran star shouting: \"Warren, what did you do??\"\nAs La La Land's crew cleared the stage, Beatty returned to the microphone and said: \"I'll tell you what happened.\n\"I opened the envelope and it said 'Emma Stone La La Land' that's why I took such a long look at Faye and then you. I wasn't trying to be funny. This is Moonlight, best picture.\"\nIt seems Beatty was right. Eagle-eyed viewers spotted that the red envelope had 'actress in a leading role' emblazoned on the front.\nIt didn't take long for the internet to come up with some conspiracy theories as to how the wrong envelope ended up on stage.\n(Photo: AFP) (Photo: Rex Features) One Twitter user spotted that Leonardo DiCaprio had been holding the best actress envelope, which somehow ended up in Beatty's hands.\nThroughout the show Kimmel referenced his \"feud\" with Bourne star Matt Damon, leading one viewer to conclude: \"I'm convinced Matt Damon did it so he has something on jimmykimmel #AcademyAwards.\"\nIn yet another bizarre twist, actress Emma appeared confused as to how Warren Beatty had ended up with her card - as she had it in her hand THE WHOLE TIME.\nDiscuss her Oscar-winning turn in 'La La Land' backstage, she knew what was on everyone's minds: the best picture snafu.\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch Next Jessica Biel and husband Justin Timberlake stun a Watch this video again Watch Next Comedian and actress Sharon Horgan causes uproar 0:40 Stacey Dooley confronts Japanese man over use of 3:55 Coleen Nolan 'storms off' Loose Women as James Co 0:38 Watch heartbreaking moment Irish child has seizur 2:08 Jamie Lynn's daughter back to playing basketball 0:20 Sutton goalkeeper Wayne eats a PIE in the middle 0:30 Emmerdale: Faith Dingle ruins the big wedding 0:28 Playboy model Sara Underwood poses for sexy snaps 0:18 Take a sneak peek at Schofield's South African Ad 0:20 Danny Dyer talks about drinking in the Queen Vic 0:30 Video will play in Emma Stone reveals she had the envelope the whole time Share this video Watch Next After widening her eyes with a deadpan stare, she cracked \"You guys see that?\"\nAnd then she got the direct question. What did she think of the moment it was announced \"La La Land\" actually didn't win best picture?\n\"I f--ing love 'Moonlight!' God, I love 'Moonlight' so much! I'm so excited for 'Moonlight.' It was an amazing thing to hear 'La La Land' [named best picture] and of course we wanted to win.\n\"But we're all so excited for 'Moonlight.' I think it's one of the best films of all time, so I was pretty beside myself.\n\"I also was holding my best actress in a leading role card [from the envelope] that entire time,\" she noted, and paused, adding that she'd like to find out exactly why the mistake was made.\n\"I'm not trying to start anything, but I'm not sure what happened, and I really wanted to talk to you guys first.\"\n(Photo: Rex Features) Warren and Fay as they prepare to read the wrong name (Photo: AFP) To clarify, there are always two sets of envelopes at the Academy Awards: The PriceWaterhouseCoopers accountants bring two briefcases, then stand backstage, one on each side of the stage. They hand the envelopes to the presenters right before they walk out.\nBut Stone took the wild events in stride, putting a positive spin on the place she now has in awards history. \"Is that the craziest Oscar moment of all time?\" she asked the journalists backstage, to which several people shouted back a hearty \"yes!\"\nLike us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Celebs Newsletter Follow @mirrorceleb Subscribe to our Celebs newsletter Enter email Subscribe More On Faye Dunaway Barry Jenkins Marc E.
