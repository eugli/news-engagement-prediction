So it makes perfect sense why everyone on Twitter thought Leslie Mann's Oscars dress looked just like Belle's from the movie's iconic ballroom dance scene. \nRemember that lovely movie moment? You know, when Belle danced with Beast in that twirly yellow gown? Back in the day, the detail that went into that dress was top-of-the-line computer graphics — which might have something to do with why it's so memorable. Or, maybe it's just the fact that, I don't know... it was so elegant and yellow. \nWhen Mann appeared on the red carpet with her husband, director Judd Apatow, everyone's mind went right back to that 1991 movie, as well as all the recent movie posters featuring Emma Watson at Belle. (Oh, be still my childhood heart!) It was hard not to see the resemblance, what with the color and the draping, and the ball gown-ness of it all. \nSome users claimed Mann took inspiration directly from Belle herself. Others were half waiting for the Beast to stroll on up and join her on the carpet. Take a look below to see what I mean.
