In a subsequent tweet, she asked the network and show to “own” and “address” the joke, and to “empower our #Queer and #Bisexual youth & community w/accurate positive reflections.” \nRamirez also retweeted a Jan. 18 statement from the LGBTQ advocacy group PFLAG, which partnered on the episode in question. “We were so focused on the family acceptance portion of the episode that we completely missed the joke,” the statement said. “In hindsight, we should have caught it and we blew it. We should have done better and we will definitely do better next time. As allies we have a responsibility to own it when we mess up.” \nGalvin also addressed the joke last month on Twitter, writing that the show “respects and loves the bi community,” and that the joke represented “a panicky teen expressing his ‘deepest fear’ which was his boyfriend leaving him for a girl.” He added, “I am sorry if we offended anyone. I hope you know our show fights for visibility and inclusivity and we will do better in the future. BUT, we also have to remember, it’s a comedy.” \nABC declined to comment on Ramirez’s criticism. \nThe Real O’Neals previously found itself at the center of controversy last year when Galvin gave an interview in which he disparaged Eric Stonestreet’s portrayal of a gay man on Modern Family , derided Arrow actor Colton Haynes’ decision to publicly come out as gay, and made “false and unwarranted” allegations about director Bryan Singer. Galvin publicly apologized for his remarks. \n— Sara Ramirez (@SaraRamirez) February 16, 2017 And as someone who worked 4 them 4 10 years+,am truly disheartened & disappointed quite frankly.I will invest my brand where I'm respected. https://t.co/NQQAPDsFlU \n— Sara Ramirez (@SaraRamirez) February 16, 2017 Dear @ABCNetwork @TheRealONeals :own it,address it,clarify it,empower our #Queer #Bisexual youth & community w/accurate positive reflections \n— Sara Ramirez (@SaraRamirez) February 16, 2017 & while @PFLAG response was amazing,where is network's response?The actor's response wasn't enough 4 me. @ABCNetwork was in the same room. https://t.co/AwjPWPJk5B \n— Sara Ramirez (@SaraRamirez) February 16, 2017 To @BobbiiLance and everyone else that wrote to me about the Biphobic joke in last nights episode of #TheRealONeals pic.twitter.com/aERx1H70QI \n— Noah Galvin (@Noahegalvin) January 18, 2017 Show Full Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:25:31.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
