And the pancakes turned out really great,‚Äù she said.\nJasmine said cooking provides an outlet for her to express herself and be creative. ‚ÄúI really enjoy cooking.

Jasmine said she decided to audition after her mom heard about the search and local auditions at a hotel in Atlanta. She said the audition started with a lengthy interview and she was then asked to cook an egg on the spot. About the show: ‚ÄúI never would have dreamed I would make it to the top 40. It was wonderful to be in a competition doing something I love.‚Äù\nJustise Mayberry, 11, of Sugar Hill: Justise remembers cooking with her dad as soon as she could reach the counter, and by age 9 her parents trusted her to slice vegetables with knives and use the stove.\nShe said one of her top priorities when cooking is to prepare healthy meals. For example, she incorporates many vegetables, including onions, peppers and carrots, into a shrimp and linguine meal, one of her favorite dishes.\nAbout cooking, Justise said, ‚ÄúIt just makes me happy. It‚Äôs something that brings the family together and helps me not get bored.‚Äù\nBeing on the show has inspired her to prepare more ambitious dishes, she said. Since returning from filming the show, she recently made a steak dinner with Brussels sprouts, spinach and bacon. But this time, she made a bacon maple cream sauce to pour on top.\nIn the #MasterChefJunior kitchen, @GordonRamsay always has your back.
