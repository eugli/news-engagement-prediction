It's disgusting.\n'I keep getting threats since reporting him but I came forward to help other people but I have been shot in the foot for it.\n'I wasn't going to tell as I was embarrassed but he told people I was accusing him.'\nLaity had previously denied the two rape charges from the 2014 attack as well as two rape charges involving a second woman from 2012 and 2013.\nBut he changed his pleas to guilty in relation to the 2014 incident on the third day of his trial at Stafford Crown Court in November.\nProsecutors didn't seek a re-trial in relation to the second victim and Judge Eades ruled that those two rape charges should lie on the file.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:59:40.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
