Heatwaves kill far more people than other natural disasters. ABC Emergency has a checklist of things you can do to be ready. \nProfessor Barnett said the coolest suburbs tended to be those with a lower population density. \n\"[Suburbs] that have a lot of green open space and a lot of blue open space, playing fields, maybe a lake and good air flow,\" he said. \n\"But you can still have a well-ventilated house in a bad suburb and similarly you can still be in a good suburb packed in surrounded by houses and not in the way of any breezes. \n\"Certainly if you have a great house in a great suburb but are silly enough to have a black roof, your house is going to get a lot hotter than if you had tree shading. \n\"If the design of the building is bad then it puts people at risk.\" \nThe research project found suburbs with high population density and not much green space meant people there faced a higher risk of heat stroke or dehydration during a heatwave. \nResidents in cooler suburbs had a low number of hospitalisations during these hot weather events. House design key to beating heatwave \nQUT engineering expert Dr Wendy Miller said housing design was the biggest problem when it came to \"thermal safety\". \nShe said Queenslanders needed to start \"future proofing\" their homes against climate change. \nBut Dr Miller said the biggest hurdle was current state regulations, which only required a minimum six-star thermal rating for new houses, on the 10-star rating scale. \n\"Six stars is based on old climate data from 30 years ago. It is also based on assumptions of what electricity costs back then,\" she said. \n\"Essentially it is a measure of how many hours in a year your house will be comfortable without the need for air-conditioning. \n\"A six-star house might mean that 50-60 per cent of the year your house will naturally be between 20C and 26C and you will only need to pay for cooling for 40 per cent of the year.

Even now we can get away with a ceiling fan and it costs the same as a project home.\" \nDr Miller said it was critical homeowners started to switch their thinking when it came to building and recommended the Federal Government YourHome website, which offers guidance on environmentally sustainable homes.

It's only in extreme weather we start to think about comfort,\" she said. \n\"We should be building houses that will be comfortable for the next 50 years as we expect to have more heat waves and more hot days, rather than building to a past climate that was not as extreme.\" \nDr Miller said it was essential consumers were made aware of energy efficiency of comfort levels before they buy, build or rent. \nNew Queensland building regulations are due in 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:58:11.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
