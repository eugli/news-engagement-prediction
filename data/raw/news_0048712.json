Or at least that's how the legend goes. The story is that a chef named George Crum was frustrated with a customer who kept complaining his fried potatoes were too thick. Eventually, Crum sliced the potatoes razor thin, fried them to a crisp, and served them with extra salt. To his surprise, the customer loved them, and potato chips were born. \nIt's a cute story, even if it's not true, and maybe there's a metaphor in there. How often have you reached for another bag of chips and thought, \"This might be a mistake?\" \nWell, once again, Lay's, one of the best-known potato chip manufacturers in the world, is following in the grand tradition of snack-time mistakes, and asking the internet to name its new chip flavor and, as in the past , no one is taking the brand seriously.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:15:21.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
