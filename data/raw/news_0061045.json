Obviously, not long after this decision made headlines, celebrity allies for the LGBTQ community flocked to Twitter in order to SLAM the Trumpster for this civil rights violation. \nVideo: Ellen Creates A New Ad For Trump's Mar-a-Lago Resort \nSpecifically Ellen DeGeneres , Ellen Page , Brie Larson , and even Donald's Inauguration Day performer Jackie Evancho , ALL spoke out against this controversial decision. Be sure to ch-ch-check out their reactions on the matter for yourself (below)! \nJust seeing the news about removing laws protecting trans people. This isn’t about politics. It’s about human rights, and it’s not okay. — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) February 23, 2017 \nWe need to protect trans youth and stand up against this cruelty that hurts our kids. Support @Translifeline — Ellen Page (@EllenPage) February 22, 2017 \nThis is disgusting. This is unacceptable.
