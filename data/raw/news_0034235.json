It’s important to me to create an environment within my leadership team where people feel that they can trust each other and feel confident sharing their ideas, even if they seem unusual or seem to run counter to the way things typically have been done. I want them to feel that they can noodle ideas together, and can imagine alternate scenarios. So how do you set that tone? It’s important for me to be willing to make myself vulnerable, to put a crazy idea out there, and let people poke holes in it, just to let them know that it’s O.K. for us to be out on the fringe a little bit. I also am very clear that I don’t have all the answers, and so I try to be as open as I can to other people’s ideas. Any surprises about the job of president? I knew intellectually that I would need to be on pretty much all the time, especially in a small college in a small town. The neighbors want to get to know you, and that’s really important and great. But what I did not expect is that role of the president in a small, liberal arts college is often sort of an emotional, symbolic center as well. That means that when unexpected things happen in the community, people want me to say or write something that is intellectually appropriate but also heartfelt. They really want to know that the emotional center is authentic. I’m not sure I appreciated that before I started. I don’t mind it at all, though. It requires me to be my better or higher self. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story How do you hire? What qualities do you look for? I’m looking for energy, imagination, creativity and evidence of an ability to work collaboratively. I tend to ask about problem-solving ability. So I would probably ask you to describe a situation in which you needed to come up with a solution to a problem that you’ve never seen before. How did you go about figuring out how to get to a solution? Did you believe you were successful? And how do you understand failure in that context? It’s important that people who work for me understand that failure is not a death sentence, and that it’s an important part of learning. It’s part of every job. What career and life advice do you give to new college graduates? I first want them to realize that in many ways they are freer at that moment, right out of college, than they are likely to be ever again. They should embrace that and be open to whatever opportunities that present themselves, especially those that are exciting or unusual or things that are going to stretch them a little bit. That’s the moment for them to follow that path and see where it leads them. They have no way of knowing what the hidden lessons will be. \nEach week, Adam Bryant talks with top executives about leadership. Follow him on Twitter: @nytcorneroffice .
