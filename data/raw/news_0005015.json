This may include an education process and dialogue with residents, experts and officials which brings clarity and understanding to our shared relationship,” said Chief Chad Eneas in a statement issued to Global Okanagan News. \nBut Kryzanowski maintains the hunters should be prosecuted. \n“It’s necessary because you know what, everybody figures they can just go do it and it’s washed under the carpet,” she said. \nIt’s not known if charges will be laid. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
