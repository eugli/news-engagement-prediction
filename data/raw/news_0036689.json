That’s part of why NBC’s breakout series \"This Is Us\" is so special. The show follows a plus-size woman named Kate (played by Chrissy Metz ) as she joins a support group for overeaters in a quest to take back her life. Though her weight-loss journey is a major part of the story line, the show is so much more than that: Kate is funny, she’s awkward, she’s sexual—she’s multidimensional, and she’s real. For a plus-size actress in Hollywood, that’s a pretty damn big deal. Recently, Metz sat down with Yahoo! News to discuss the series, speaking at length about her role in re-shaping Hollywood’s historically narrow definition of “beauty.” Metz tells interviewer Katie Couric she’s “really happy” to be a part of the movement towards embracing diversity and promoting inclusivity. \"[S]o much of the mainstream media has taught us what beautiful is, but everyone is beautiful,\" she says. \"And everyone is exceptionally beautiful in their own way.\" You May Also Like Celebrity Ivanka Trump's Perfume Is the Top-Selling Fragrance on Amazon Right Now Though there was some controversy late last year about a contract requiring Metz to lose weight during the series (as her character embarks on a journey to do the same), Metz has said that if she does lose weight, it’s for personal reasons—not to conform to Hollywood’s standards. She tells Couric, \"We’re kind of taught that if you are a size two, you’re beautiful. But just because you’re a size two doesn’t mean you are beautiful, or that you’re healthy: mentally, emotionally or physically. So, it doesn’t always add up.\" Still, Metz says, she’s excited to be a role model in a movement that celebrates “embracing who we are.” She adds, “I think it’s wonderful.” Gotta say: We agree.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:23:54.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
