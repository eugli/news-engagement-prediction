If not, keep reading. Currently in its ninth year, the Saturday night party has thus far been held at local institution 1515 Broadway. This year, however, the night will be taking place for the first time at another venue in the city, Canfield, and will feature Brooklyn's Galcher Lustwerk, Detroit's Patrice Scott, as well as Kai Alcé himself on DJ duties. Like years past, the party will also be selling a coveted limited edition 12\" from Alcé's NDATL label. Head to Facebook for more info and tickets to what promises to be another great showing of true Detroit deepness.
