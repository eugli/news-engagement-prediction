He'd been waiting for this day, and when his doctor handed him the mirror... He had a new face, a face that belonged to another man. He is happy! His father, brother, his family was right there with him joined by several doctors and nurses at the Mayo Clinic. They watched him as he studied his swollen features. He still needed a speech therapy to help him speak quickly. He scribbled mere four words in a spiral notebook showing his gratitude: \"Far exceeded my expectations.\" All his hopes got answered by Mardini, a plastic surgeon whose speciality is facial reconstruction. His medical journey came to an end after 10 long years. It was difficult to get his way back. His world was shrunk. He was tired of hiding his truth from people.
