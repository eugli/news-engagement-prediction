Share via Twitter Natalie Portman —who's up for a Best Actress Oscar for Jackie —said today that she won't be attending the Oscars tomorrow—and she has a very good reason. Namely, she's pregnant : Portman is in her third trimester . The baby will be the second child with husband Benjamin Millepied . Portman was also unable to attend Saturday's Independent Spirit Awards , where Jackie is up for four awards, including Best Female Lead, Best Feature, Best Director, and Best Editing. \"Due to my pregnancy, I am unable to attend the Independent Spirit Awards and the Academy Awards,\" says Portman in a (lovely) statement to The Hollywood Reporter . \"I feel so lucky to be honored among my fellow nominees and wish them the most beautiful of weekends.\" We can't blame her at all, TBH. Both ceremonies are obviously a big deal, but it takes a ton of work to get ready for occasions like these. We hope she's at home and comfy on the couch, preferably with ice cream.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:49:25.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
