12:00am Tourism director Verna Covar-Buensuceso presents Madrid Fusion Manila 2017. With her are Filipino chef Myke “Tattung” Sarthou and Lourdes Plana of Spain’s Foro de Debate S.L., the organizer of Madrid Fusion \nMANILA, Philippines – When Madrid Fusión Manila began three years ago, the world barely knew about the cuisine and ingredients of the Philippines. \n“Today, food forecasts for 2017 have predicted the Philippines as the place where the next big food trend will start, and many articles have been written worldwide about how the food scene in the Philippines is heating up,” said Tourism director Verna Covar-Buensuceso at center stage of Madrid Fusión 2017 at Palacio Municipal de Congresos, Madrid. \nThis year the country marks another milestone with the third serving of Madrid Fusión Manila from April 6 to 8. \n“On our first year our theme was the 300 years of the gastronomic journey with Spain,” Covar-Buensuceso said. “Last year in celebration of the 450 years of the Manila Galleon trade, the theme centered on east-meets-west. This year, with the many issues facing our world, we have chosen a theme that is relevant to our times: Towards a sustainable gastronomic planet.” \nChef-presenters at Madrid Fusión Manila 2017 include Gert de Mangeleer (Hertog Jan, 3 Michelin stars); Jordi Roca and Alejandro Rivas (El Celler de Can Roca, 3 Michelin stars); Rodrigo de la Calle (El Invernadero, 1 Michelin star); Regis Marcon (Regis & Jacques Marcon, 3 Michelin stars); Pedro Subijana (Akelare, 3 Michelin stars); Paco Perez (Miramar, 2 Michelin stars); Julien Royer (Odette, 2 Michelin stars); Magnus Ek (Oaxen Krog & Slip, 2 Michelin stars); Akrame Benallal (Akrame, 1 Michelin star); Simon Rogan (L’Enclume, 2 Michelin stars); Kamilla Seidler and Michelangelo Cestari (Gustu, 1 Michelin star); Josean Alija, Nerua, 1 Michelin star); Tony Yoo (24 Seasons, 2 Michelin stars); Ray Adriansyah (Locavore); Vicky Lau (Tate Dining Room and Bar); Robby Goco (Green Pastures); Jordy Navarra (Black Sheep/Toyo Eatery); Gene Gonzalez (Café Ysabel); Tatiana and Katia Levha (Le Servan); and Filipino-American pastry chef Sally Camacho Mueller. \nMadrid Fusión Manila (MFM) has become the largest international gastronomy event in our country over the last three years. Held yearly in Madrid for the past 15 years, the event is part conference and part trade show, where some of the world’s top chefs showcase new techniques, ingredients and recipes.   \nMadrid Fusión first came to the Philippines in 2015. It was known as (MFM) and organized by the Department of Tourism (DOT), Tourism Promotions Board (TPB), Spain’s Foro de Debate S.L. (the organizers of Madrid Fusión) and Arum Estrategias Internacionalización (Arum), in partnership with members of the private sector. \nThe aim of MGM is to highlight the Philippines as an emerging culinary destination with an abundance of natural resources and cultural influences. \nCovar-Buensuceso thanked Madrid Fusión for allowing the country to bring this premier gastronomic event here, because, she said, “it has definitely expanded the gastronomic conversation to our side of the globe. On this, your 15th birthday, we would like to convey our congratulations to Madrid Fusión’s work in inspiring the current chefs and food enthusiasts to constantly innovate.” \nIn 2015, two of Filipino chefs, Margarita Fores and Myrna Segismundo, were invited to speak at Madrid Fusión 2015. At that engagement the two shared the origins of the famous Filipino dish kinilaw. \nKinilaw was chosen by the organizers of Madrid Fusión when they tasted it for the first time because of its being a local Filipino dish with various ways of cooking in different regions of the country; and was a good choice for sharing at Madrid Fusión 2015. \nThe following year, 2016, Margarita Fores was named Asia’s top female chef. \nIn 2016, another Philippine-based chef, Chele Gonzalez, presented on the Madrid Fusión stage. Chef Chele shared his own experience working with indigenous Philippine ingredients being sourced by local farmers. In 2016 his Philippine-based restaurant Vask, which uses locally sourced ingredients, was named one of Asia’s 50 best restaurants. \nThis year, the Filipino chef-presenter was Myke “Tattung” Sarthou, who spoke about Rediscovering Pre-Hispanic Filipino Cuisine and his advocacy on bringing back locally produced salt. \n“Our culinary industry has awakened our DNA and our chefs and chef students have been inspired by the best chefs in the world to share what they know at Madrid Fusión Manila, “ added Covar-Buensuceso. “As a result, many chef organizations have been born on our 7,107 islands.” \n“We ask you to join us as we continue to build on our efforts to establish the Philippines as the center of gastronomy in Asia,” she added. “Friends, let our gastronomic journey continue.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:28:30.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
