For example, if we lodge a complaint via WhatsApp, we are vulnerable to hate messages, which might become viral,” he added. \nSharing Amin’s sentiments is fellow fifth former Emily, who agreed that the digital platform is not a secure medium. \n“If students use these platforms, their identity could be exposed. Dropping letters in a complaint box allows the complainant to remain anonymous,” she said. \nHowever, Samuel Yesuiah, a tea­cher trainer in Seremban, questioned whether the ministry or schools are ready for the onslaught of complaints. \n“And will there be a standard procedure to solve them, and who will be the ones sorting them out?” he asked. \nMalacca Action Group for Parents in Education (Magpie) chairman Mak Chee Kin, too, was not in favour of the move. \n“It may seem like a selfish thought, but we send our children to school to seek knowledge, not to get themselves involved in other students’ issues or misconduct. \n“I want my children to study hard and mind their own business,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:04:52.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
