The court heard Chapman, from Poynton, Cheshire, was spotted holding his mobile at an ‘unusual angle’ behind the girls as he followed them. \n“He had his phone held in such a way that he was filming them or taking photographs of them,” said prosecutor Nicola Yeadon. \nManchester magistrates said they had ‘substantial grounds’ to impose a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for five years, adding that it was ‘proportionate and necessary’.

Police attended and seized his phone. \nThe court heard ‘various images’ of the two girls were found on his phone ‘with a focus on their bottoms’. Ms Yeadon said images of other women ‘and their lower halves’ were also discovered on Chapman’s phone. They had been taken on trains and in an office environment, the court was told. Paul Chapman \nChapman, who was arrested at the store, pleaded guilty to an act of outraging public decency by taking photographs on a mobile phone of the bottoms of young girls. \nIn a victim impact statement, one of the girls said: “The whole thing has made me more aware that there are people like that. It is not fair that you cannot go in a shop with people doing things like this.” Read More Pictured: Moment bungling burglar got stuck in bathroom window \nHer sister said it made her feel like she couldn’t enter supermarkets anymore. She added in her statement: “It has made my anxiety worse. It has made me not trust men.” \nMax Saffman, defending, said the offence wasn’t sexually motivated and there was a denial of sexual gratification and motivation by Chapman. Mr Saffman said: “He suffers from anxiety and depression. He was constantly messing around with his phone. He denies any sexual motivation or gratification.” \nThe court heard he has lost his job and the case has had a ‘considerable impact’ on his family. \nChapman, who had no previous convictions, was also sentenced to a three-year community order with a 60-day period of rehabilitation with the Probation Service, where he will attend tailored courses. He was ordered to pay £100 cost and £75 compensation each to his victims.
