Slot to 247Sports Links \nOle Miss announced on Tuesday that it has received a revised Notice of Allegations from the NCAA Committee on Infractions that adds eight new charges against the school, including lack of institutional control and a charge against Hugh Freeze for failing to promote an atmosphere of compliance. The school announced the charges and their intent to contest several of them in a 20-minute video posted to YouTube. The Rebels are self-imposing a one-year bowl ban and will forfeit their portion of the Southeastern Conference's postseason revenue sharing. \nThe charges against the Ole Miss athletics department now total 21, with eight added in the updated NOA. Athletics director Ross Bjork said that one of the previous charges was expanded from the initial NOA but that none of them were related to the incident involving Laremy Tunsil on the night of the 2016 NFL Draft. The next step is for Ole Miss to respond to the NOA and for the Committee on Infractions to set a hearing before rendering its decision.
