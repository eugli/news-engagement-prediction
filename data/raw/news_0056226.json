He said North Korean diplomat held the rank of second secretary at the embassy. \nKim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was killed at Kuala Lumpur International Airport last week while he was preparing to board a flight to Macau. \nKhalid told a news conference that police \"strongly believed\" four other suspects who fled Malaysia on Feb. 13, the day of the attack, had arrived in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. \n(Reporting by Rozanna Latiff; Writing by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore) Next In World News Iraqi forces fighting Islamic State set to storm airport, clear way to western Mosul \nSOUTH OF MOSUL, Iraq/BAGHDAD U.S.-backed Iraqi forces closing in on the Islamic State-held western half of Mosul prepared on Tuesday to storm the airport and a nearby military base on its southern outskirts to create a bridgehead for a thrust into the city.
