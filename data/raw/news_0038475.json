The “306” was a reference to his electoral college total. \nPelosi and Schiff, whose committee is already investigating Trump-Russia connections, cited the “severity and urgency of the counterintelligence threat from Moscow” in a letter to Michael Dempsey, who is acting as director of national intelligence ahead of a confirmation hearing for Trump nominee Dan Coats.

Trump on Thursday pledged over Twitter to put a “ spotlight ” on the “low-life leakers” even as he accused the media of making up sources for an array of stories that refute key aspects of the White House’s portrayal of those ties. \nThe intelligence agencies have seen Trump vacillate between cultivation, detente and hostility toward them several times since his election. Some within have feared a purge or a marginalization by Trump after assessing Russian interference in the campaign. Trump has accused leakers of “criminal” disclosures of intelligence, a seeming reference to – and perhaps accidental validation of – the Flynn-Kislyak intercepts. \nThose fears are likely to accelerate after a report in the New York Times that Trump intends to put a loyalist, Stephen A Feinberg, in charge of a long-rumored “review” of the intelligence agencies for structural changes. \nIt is unknown how Feinberg will work with Coats. Coats’ nomination is said to be in limbo while the Senate intelligence committee – of which, as an Indiana senator, he was once a member – scrutinizes his paperwork. Yet Coats is expected to have his confirmation hearing scheduled after the Senate returns on 27 February from a recess.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T20:06:19.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
