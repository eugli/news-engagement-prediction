Hopefully about four weeks of water,\" Bill Ward said. \n\"We grow zucchinis, gold squash, four different types of eggplant, watermelons, rockmelons and pumpkins. \n\"We grow some of the lines only for domestic use, as in Maryborough and Hervey Bay, and that's the market we're hoping to enlarge our participation in to go away from sending just to the Brisbane markets.\" External Link: Farmer documents dropping water level \nHis son Colin Ward said when they first bought the property 15 years ago, the family built the 3.2-hectare dam to ensure future water security. \n\"We were never going to have a problem with water. It was huge. Well, here we stand in the bottom of the dam,\" he said. \n\"It's good exercise to walk around the dam to see where the water used to be because there is a very large area of dam here and no water at all. \n\"Anything that isn't top of the range type of thing I've already cut off because we just cannot afford the water, and the more we cut off the less range we have, the less we can deliver to the local people, which is what we're trying to do. \n\"As far down as I can dig it's just dust all the way. Any hope of growing in there is, without decent rain, just not a chance at all. \n\"No rain, no crop. No crop, no us.\" Crowdfunding a new bore \nWhile things are looking bleak for the Ward family, Tracy Bullen, a keen bird photographer and regular visitor to the dam is doing her best to help. \nWhen she saw the family was in trouble she started an online Go Fund Me campaign to try to help them raise money for a bore. \n\"I rang up a couple of places to find out the cost, the general consensus was around $12,000,\" she said.

(Supplied: Tracy Bullen) \n\"If possible we'd like to get a lot of smaller donations from people because we don't want people to struggle trying to help out as well.\" \nMs Bullen is a regular visitor to the dam, photographing the huge array of bird life that called the waterhole home. \n\"It was absolutely beautiful, there would be black-necked storks out here and white-faced herons. You would have eagles that would come down, kites, just about everything,\" she said. \nBut now with the dam level falling lower and lower, Ms Bullen hopes that a crowdfunding campaign to supply a water bore could save the family. \n\"It's really hard to watch it just go down and down. [The family] don't know anything else,\" she said. \n\"I cry and it's not even my farm. \n\"They've been trying so hard to turn everything around and become more community minded rather than commercial growers, which was really exciting.\" \nBill said the forecast was for above average rain in April and May, with heavy rain for June and July. \nBut the reality is that rain is too far away. They need water and they need it today. \n\"The only thing that we can do is drill for water. It's the only thing. We've got streams under here, but it's a matter of getting to them,\" he said. \n\"But without rain and no bore, well, it will be another family farm down the drain. \n\"You're looking at 15 to 16 years of your life basically wasted because there is no coming back from it because if we lose our water we lose all our crops. \n\"To start all over again even if we've got the water, we've got to work the ground, we've got seed to buy, and seed is quite expensive these days, everything just mounts up on top of you. \n\"It gets to the stage where, you ask is it actually worth it? \n\"The thing that I feel for is the boys, because they put so much of their life into it. This is their life.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:50:36.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
