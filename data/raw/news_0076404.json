'Carnival is a very nice and democratic party,' said partygoer Nilse Azevedo. 'Whoever wants to pray, prays. Whoever wants to have fun in the street has fun.' But it was the odd opening to the iconic festival, which brings in more than $ 1 billion to Rio each year, that was the talk of the day. A dancer from the Tom Maior samba school performing during the opulent carnival parade in Sao Paulo on Friday Glamorous women wearing skimpy two-piece costumes and adorned with feathers danced the night away in Rio Carnival King Momo, Fabio Damiao dos Santos Antunes, held up the key to the city at the opening ceremony, marking the start of the celebrations. Mayor Marcelo Crivella had delayed the start of the ceremony, before skipping it entirely At the sambadrome, where top league samba schools begin competing on Sunday, revelers waited Friday for the traditional handing over of the city's key to 'Rei Momo,' or the king of carnal delights. This was always done with great fanfare by former Mayor Eduardo Paes. But the current mayor, Crivella, decided to send the head of Rio's tourism agency to represent him at the opening ceremony. Even stranger was the quick removal of Rei Momo, who did not give interviews as usual and was escorted out of the sambadrome by security guards. It isn't clear whether Crivella, a retired Pentecostal bishop who took office on Jan. 1, will attend any of the five days of parades at the sambadrome. Rio's city council has already authorized him to travel abroad on the next few days. Earlier Friday, when it was still unclear whether the mayor would come for the opening ceremony, Maria Cristina held the symbolic key to the city, appearing like somebody who had been stood up. 'I would also like to know what is going on,' said Cristina, the guardian of the key, when asked by an Associated Press reporter about what she would do with it.

The mayor 'should separate religion from politics at our Carnival,' said Marisol Portela, a homemaker who had come to the sambadrome. 'He will not be missed. We will throw our party anyway.' The annual Carnival celebrations come at a difficult time for many Brazilians. The economy is mired in recession, leading to daily announcements of job cuts and much angst about the future. Many states, including Rio de Janeiro, are so broke that thousands of public workers are being paid months late, if at all. Latin America's largest nation is also recovering from a brutal impeachment fight last year that led to the removal of President Dilma Rousseff for illegal mismanagement of the budget. The man who replaced her, Michel Temer, is deeply unpopular. Temer and several others in both chambers of Congress have been caught up, either through formal charges or in plea bargains, in a massive corruption probe that has jailed dozens of politicians and businessmen in the last few years. Temer denies wrongdoing. One of Rio's big block parties is dedicated to the president. It's theme: 'Out with Temer!' In Sao Paulo, where samba school competitions get started Friday night, there was heavy rain and thunder. Some streets in the eastern part of the megacity were flooding.
