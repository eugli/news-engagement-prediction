Ben Shapiro gives Bernie Sanders a lesson on fascism, and it ain’t pretty Posted at 10:43 am on February 23, 2017 by Sam J. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nIt all started with a tweet from Speaker Ryan about freedom being the ability to buy what you want to fit the need you have. Freedom is the ability to buy what you want to fit what you need. Obamacare is Washington telling you what to buy regardless of your needs. \n— Paul Ryan (@PRyan) February 21, 2017 \nMakes sense, yeah? \nOf course the idea of freedom and spending your money as you see fit freaked out Bernie Sanders (and a whole lot of other socialists who get confused about living in a Republic): What good is the freedom to buy the health care you want if you can’t afford it? https://t.co/2eKbRZoN5C \n— Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) February 22, 2017 Trending D MN! Ben Shapiro gives Bernie Sanders a lesson on fascism, and it ain't pretty \nHuh? It's a lot better than not being able to buy the health care I want even when I can afford it. That's fascism. https://t.co/Hh2XLL8U5u \n— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) February 23, 2017 \nBingo. The Left will never really understand basic capitalism. \nThis is not difficult. The Feds should never tell citizens they have to purchase a product or tell them which product they have to buy. And they sure as Hell shouldn’t penalize them with a tax if they can’t afford to buy said product. \nBecause yeah, that’s fascism. \nFascism BAD. \n— Adam Strange (@Adam_Strange) February 23, 2017 \nSadly it’s our healthcare that’s really ‘rekt’ these days. @benshapiro @SenSanders know what's really awful?Being FORCED to buy health INS (not care) that I can't afford. Costs more than my mortgage. \nFor some reason, Bernie thinks people paying for health insurance they can’t afford to use is freedom. \nSo much facepalm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:09:52.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
