A toddler could have predicted that one. \nYet the team with the next-best odds to win the whole thing caught Colin's attention, so he had to break down why the Dallas Cowboys are due for a bit of regression next season. Colin: The key to predicting how teams will fare next season is QBs \nCOLIN : \"So I'm sitting looking over some odds last night, and [an oddsmaker in] the NFL has the Patriots as favorites to win the Super Bowl, but their second team is the Dallas Cowboys. And I was sitting there last night, and I've had this belief — and I've done this for years and years — is that I've always been decent at predicting who's going to win and who's not going to win. \n\"And one of the things I look at is quarterbacks. How many Pro Bowl-level quarterbacks do you play?\" Colin: Pump the brakes on the Cowboys \nCOLIN : \"I think we're getting way ahead of ourselves on the Cowboys. I like the Cowboys, and I think they're going to be very, very good for the next five or six years, but let's slow down. I already know who the Cowboys play; you can find who the Cowboys play next year. \n\"We know they play a first-place schedule. So they're going to play first-place teams in the NFC. We already know they're going to host Green Bay. We already know they're going to host Seattle. We already know that. \n\"And we know they're going to go to Atlanta. Those are three tough games. We also know they face the AFC West next year. So I already know they go to Denver and they go to the Raiders. I know that. And I know they host San Diego/L.A. and Kansas City. Here's what's interesting.\" Getty Images Getty Images Colin: Dallas faces a gauntlet of elite QBs in 2017 \nCOLIN : \"So here are the quarterbacks — and I'm not counting Eli, Carson Wentz in his second year, and Kirk Cousins, capable — I'm talking the non-divisional quarterbacks Dallas will face next year: Carson Palmer, Philip Rivers, Alex Smith, Matt Ryan, Aaron Rodgers, Derek Carr and Russell Wilson.\" Colin: Cowboys had it easy in 2016 \nCOLIN : \"So this year, the Cowboys were ... 13-3. Everybody loves them. So we know their schedule's going to be tougher. I just laid it out for you. I'm going to make the argument it will be judged as the toughest schedule in the league. ... \n\"Here's the quarterbacks Dallas faced last year, just to give you some comparison: Brian Hoyer, Blaine Gabbert, Cody Kessler, Andy Dalton — Big Ben was good — Joe Flacco, Sam Bradford, a hurt Matthew Stafford, and Jameis Winston. Uhhh, got news for you. Not the same. \n\"And the second time they played Green Bay [in the playoffs], they lost, and Green Bay was beat up.\" Colin: One more reason for worry \nCOLIN : \"Never forget that RG3 and Colin Kaepernick blew us away in their first full years as starters. ... Now the NFL coordinators have an offseason to look at Dak. ... \n\"This is not a 13-3 team next year. Now, I think Dallas is very, very well built for the future. But do I think Dak's going to take a step back? Do I think the Cowboys are going to be something less than 13-3. Yep. \n\"Do I think they're going on this magical trip for two-and-a-half months, don't lose, and seemingly have two MVPs? I don't think that's going to happen. \n\"I think there's going to be a pullback for Dallas. I still think they're a playoff team, but when I look at these Vegas odds, I think we're getting way ahead of ourselves.\" Matthew Emmons USA TODAY Sports", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:12:20.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
