He's won the event four times. (Jeff Gross/Getty Images) \nTo a 10-handicap stuck at home in the wintry North, an exempt PGA TOUR member sitting out the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am could be construed as an insult. \nYes, playing golf for a living is an entirely different animal than planning a vacation to soak in the experience on the Monterey Peninsula, but there’s only one Pebble Beach! But of course, every touring professional can’t play every week. Well, it is logistically possible for some of the elite who are exempt into every event, but the pitfalls of that kind of commitment are obvious. With wall-to-wall golf for the first eight months of the calendar year, scheduling time off is a way of life. \nThat brings us back to this week’s 156-man gathering at Pebble Beach, Spyglass Hill and Monterey Peninsula Country Club’s Shore Course. Fans tune in to watch familiar faces and learn about a few others who will battle for the trophy, but also the celebrities who participate in the pro-am portion of the competition. It’s that dynamic that sheds light on the professionals who choose to show immaterial of the courses, locale and another opportunity to win. Those who aren’t necessarily desperate for FedExCup points and still attend reveal character and comfort levels that can’t be quantified. To them, it’s inherently enjoyable. They help construct the backbone of the tournament that turns 80 this year. \nLong rounds, amateur partners, three courses, Poa annua greens, often inclement weather. All of it contributes to the experience at the AT&T. \nSince only the host course is lasered for ShotLink purposes, measurements such as distance of all drives, proximity to the hole and strokes gained: putting are not gathered at Spyglass Hill and MPCC. So, the identifiers beneath the first table focus only on data collected on all three courses. Not all remaining tournaments during the 2016-17 season will utilize ShotLink, but the AT&T is the last event of the season contested over multiple tracks.
