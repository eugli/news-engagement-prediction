Some of which makes very little sense. \nIn some places, you can even pay to have a nice, deconstructed cup of the stuff , should you ever feel like invalidating the whole point of buying it in the first place. \nThis choice may seem like a good thing, but it can also be somewhat daunting (and annoying). \nSo, the next time you need a caffeine injection, you can eliminate at least five of them, as these are the options, according to PureWow , no self-respecting barista would plump for. 1. Extra-Hot Americano. \nThere's only so much heat a person can take. \nThere's also just the one fixed temperature at which water boils. An extra hot coffee probably isn't worth it (Photo: E+) \nSo, with that in mind, what exactly is the point in having an extra-hot drink? \nBy ordering your Americano extra hot, you are still buying the same boiling water as everyone else. \nPlus you have to wait even longer to enjoy your coffee. 2. 'Bone-dry' cappuccino. \nWe don't know what this means. Do you know what this means? \nAnyway, in case - like us - you don't, a 'bone-dry' cappuccino is simply espresso with some added foam, with the steamed milk left out. Don't order these 'bone dry' (Photo: Getty) \nThis may not sound so bad, but according to the barista not only is it a pain to make, but it's \"not even really a beverage\" - and therefore probably not worth the Â£4 you're being charged. 3. Skimmed soy latte. \nSkimmed milk exists. Soy milk exists. Skimmed soy milk, alas, does not. \nThis drink is a work of fiction. 4. Cappuccino with almond milk. Almond milk is a sweet and delightful alternative to whole cow's milk. But while whole milk can be turned into a dense, proper froth, almond milk simply turns a little thicker when steamed. Whole milk is best for bubbles and froth (Photo: Getty) 5. And forget the secret menu... \nTrue, many an eating establishment have created a secret menu , but if every coffee shop did have one, all of the best drinks would be on the regular menu anyway.
