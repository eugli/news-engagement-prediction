Whereas, the portrayal of this situation is unbelievable and could result in the undermining of faith in the FBI...\" the resolution states.\n\"Whereas, Director Comey demonstrated in the recent 2016 election that he does not need to be blackmailed to engage in illegal partisan actions, and ... Whereas Director Comey's infamous, partisan, and illegal letters resulted in the election of the man some refer to as 'not my president,\" the resolution continues.\n  Democrats have claimed Comey's late October announcement — that his agency had reason to continue an investigation into Hillary Clinton 's use of a private email server as secretary of state — cost the Democratic presidential nominee the election. Comey issued a follow-up statement a week and a half later saying they were no longer looking into the issue, but Democrats have said the initial press conference damaged her chances.\nThe DNC resolution adds: \"Therefore, be it resolved, that all US citizens are encouraged to have the same respect for the FBI as Director Comey demonstrated with his illegal actions.\"\n\"Designated Survivor\" — starring Kiefer Sutherland, whose character takes over as president after terrorists blow up the Capitol during the State of the Union address — involves a plotline where a top FBI official is blackmailed into confessing a crime he did not commit.\nThe Democratic National Committee will vote next week on a resolution to condemn the ABC show \"Designated Survivor.\" pic.twitter.com/I1f5dfr19G — Reid J.

The law gave states the option of denying drug users these benefits.\nBut Republicans opposed the rule from the Labor Department because it limited this option, by only allowing states to deny benefits to people in the transportation or pipeline management industries, those who use firearms in their job, or people in jobs that normally require drug testing.\nThe House voted\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 02/15/17 5:12 PM Top Story McConnell:   for Supreme Court McConnell   nomination.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 02/15/17 4:36  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:31:48.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
