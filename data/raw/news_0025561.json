But he won’t be coaching basketball in any official capacity. \n“I tried coaching,” he said of his brief stint on the sidelines in 1994. “I never wanted to be a coach.” \nThe job is apparently full time. Johnson said he’s handing over day-to-day operations of his businesses to executives at Magic Johnson Enterprises. \nHe said Lakers fans will need to be patient, however, as any return to glory will likely take several years. \n“It’s going to take three to five years to get them back and rolling again,” he said. “You have to develop your own players. You have to make sure you hit a home run when you draft.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:37:33.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
