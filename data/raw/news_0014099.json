Lamar Peters drove to the rim with Williams in pursuit. \nTennessee's freshman forward blocked the shot from the backside, pinning the ball against the backboard, but goaltending gave the bucket to Peters and a 59-55 lead to Mississippi State. \n“Instead of being a four-point game, it should have been a two-point game with us with the ball,” Barnes said, “and maybe we could have stopped the momentum.” \nTennessee led by 19, at 29-10, with 4:50 left in the first half. Mississippi State used an 18-3 run in the second half to get back in the game, as the Vols went over five minutes without a made field goal. \nXavian Stapleton put the Bulldogs up for good with a 3-pointer with 4:22 left. A Mario Kegler three on the next possession built the lead to four before Admiral Schofield answered in the paint with a bucket, making it 57-55 before the goaltend was called on the other end. \n“That was a big play from us because we were struggling,” Barnes said. “At that point in time, with momentum going their way, you don’t want something like that to happen. \n“I don’t want to take anything away from Mississippi State, but that is disappointing because we did make a great defensive play. We said we needed to get a stop right here, forced them in to drive the ball and (Williams) blocked it. Would have been a shot-clock violation and they got two points out of it.” \nWilliams struggled to find words for an answer when asked about the play. \n“It was a play,” Williams said. “It happens. We had to respond to it, and we didn’t.” \nLayups from Bone and Jordan Bowden cut the State lead to 60-59 with 1:05 left, but the Vols didn’t have any answers from there. \nSchofield was called for an offensive foul with 6:43 left, a call that was upgraded to a Flagrant 1 after officials went to the monitor to review the play. \nBarnes didn’t dispute that call. The goaltend was a different story. \n“They said it was an elbow to the face, but I didn’t see it,” he said of the Schofield foul. “They said elbow to the face. I would like to have had more of an explanation of the goaltend. \n“You go to the monitor, you can see an elbow to the face. That one you understand. I don’t think they went to the monitor and got it wrong. An elbow to the face, I have to believe they saw it and got that right. They didn’t get the goal tend right.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T06:55:54.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
