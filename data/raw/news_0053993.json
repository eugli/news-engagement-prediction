Image: netflix By Proma Khosla 2017-02-23 17:47:51 UTC \nWe have a release date . We have episode titles . We have an endless loop of Millie Bobby Brown videos to watch until Halloween, but what else can we pore over until Stranger Things comes back? For now we'll settle for nitpicking every known plot detail — it'll have to be October by then, right? \nHere's what we know for sure about Stranger Things 2 ...besides the fact that we'll love it. SEE ALSO: 'Stranger Things' is clearly the inspiration for this horror game Eleven is back, but how? \nActually, let's be clear: Brown is back, but Eleven isn't spoken for yet. In fact, the season at least begins with Mike mourning her apparent death in their fight against the Demagorgon — but we know that Sheriff Hopper ain't leaving no Eggos in the woods for the bears. While Season 1 was about meeting Eleven as she is now and seeing how she interacts with people for the first time, Season 2 will go deeper into her history and background. The new kids on the block \nDacre Montgomery and Sadie Sink are moving to Hawkins as step-siblings who become immediately entangled in the lives of characters we've come to love. Sink plays Max, who ends up hanging out with the young boys, while Montgomery plays her older, unruly brother. Will is definitely not okay \n'I'm just a slug boy, nobody loves me' \nImage: netflix \nThe young Mr. Byers burped up a slug in the Season 1 finale, and according to the show runners he's \" seeing images from the Upside Down \" which may or may not be real. Does this mean he could somehow get sucked back to the parallel dimension? Is he connected to the Demogorgon or becoming part of this other world? Also, can he taste food, or will Dustin continue to eat all the pudding? There's a new sheriff...in the lab \nPaul Reiser (of Aliens fame that inspired the Duffer brothers) arrives in Hawkins to clean up last season's supernatural mess, but we can't trust his character's motives. \"They told me who I was playing and they told me what they had in mind,\" he recently revealed . It was sort of nebulous — is he a good guy or a bad guy? To be honest, I’ve only read a few of the scripts so I still don’t know and I’m not sure they know.\" Hey, Eleven, care to comment? Hopper is trying to keep it together for the kids \nLike Joyce, Sheriff Hopper is trying to return to normalcy by covering up everything he and the kids went through in Season 1. \"He's struggling with the compromise that takes him to, having to lie and cover things up,\" actor David Harbour told EW . It is so like a grown-up to panic and forget supernatural adventures. Joyce is back in the dating game \nGaten Matarazzo, Noah Schnapp, Winona Ryder and newcomer Sadie Sink. \nImage: netflix \nWill and Jonathan's mother (Winona Ryder) deserves some love after her Yuletide decor meltdown in Season 1 (and, you know, almost losing her son). Bob (Sean Astin) is a former classmate of Joyce's who Rider says she brings in to give the boys a \"good father figure.\" And probably a few Goonies references. Barb is dead \nThis is no longer news, but it's important that no Stranger Things post should publish to the internet without furthering the cause of #JusticeForBarb. Dustin gets a pet \nAnd it's not a quiet, superpowered girl from a sinister lab. Actor Gaten Matarazzo told EW that Dustin acquires a \"polliwog-like pet\" (episode 6 is called \"The Pollywog\") that is \"obviously not from this planet or this dimension.” Pretty on-brand, Dustin.
