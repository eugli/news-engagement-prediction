Passengers facing problems with their hand luggage are a regular sight at airports. A new research revealed that passengers, who are unexpectedly made to put their hand luggage in the hold when at the gate, risk leaving valuable, uninsured items in an unsecured bag. The Which? Travel research found that many plane cabins only have capacity for half of all passengers' carry-on bags. Hoping to cut costs on check-in staff and fuel, airlines have been encouraging people to travel with only hand baggage for years. But on a full flight, many plane cabins only have capacity for half of all passengers' carry-on bags. So staff at the gate select a number of passengers' cabin bags to be placed in the hold at the last minute, often not warning them to remove valuables or giving them sufficient time to repack. According to the study, one in ten said they were asked to put their cabin luggage in the hold on their last flight, despite the bag meeting all size and weight requirements. On Easyjet, this figure increases to 15%. More than a quarter of Ryanair passengers were forced to put their cabin bags in the hold. Here are the restrictions on cabin baggage for 8 airlines, including information on weight and size restrictions: Ryanair More than a quarter of Ryanair passengers were forced to put their cabin bags in the hold. Passengers are allowed to carry \"one cabin bag per passenger (excluding infants travelling on a parent's lap) weighing up to 10kg with maximum dimensions of 55cm x 40cm x 20cm\". Did you know, you can bring a free 10kg bag & 2nd small bag on-board?
