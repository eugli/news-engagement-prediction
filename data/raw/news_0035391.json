Montreal city \nE dinburgh has moved up to 18th place from 33rd, Manchester rises 13 places to 23rd, while Glasgow is in 34th place, Coventry 39th and Nottingham 43rd. \nJust outside the top 50 are Birmingham in 55th place and Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 56th. \n\"One of the main reasons for London's increase is its 15-rank rise for affordability, reflecting the post-referendum weakening of the pound against the dollar,\" the rankings note. \nLondon also remains one of the world's most diverse cities, ranking 10th globally for student mix, it says, adding: \"Only Tokyo and Seoul rank above London for employer activity, suggesting that the quality of universities offered by London will ensure that it remains a desirable hunting-ground for the world's employers.\" Montreal leads the way \nMichèle Glémaud, Admissions Director at the Université de Montréal, said that Montreal is both multicultural and affordable, as well as being a “modern, young and vibrant city which is both a great place to study and to live.\" He added his thanks to the students, “who for the first time, had a say in the ranking.” \nMontreal has two universities, both of which are international leaders . McGill University is ranked as 30th in the world and offers courses in English. Université de Montréal offers courses in French, and is ranked 126th globally. \nMontreal’s success comes after higher rates of immigration to Canada compared to other Western countries and following concerns over entry to the U.S. \nA spokeswoman for the city of Montreal told the BBC that there had been a huge increase in international student number, especially from China and India. Students at graduation Credit: Chris Ison/PA International students in the UK \nI nternational students add at least £7 billion to the economy annually. UK training and education exports bring in around £14 billion per annum, and this could increase to as much as £26 billion by 2025. \nOver 40 percent of postgraduates are also international students, meaning the UK’s research base benefits - especially in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. US strength in numbers \nThe US, however, has the greatest number of international students , with over one million currently studying in the country. \nOverall, international students contribute $36 billion to the U.S. economy \n60 percent of students from abroad studying in America are from China, India, Saudi Arabia or South Korea. \nInternational students help prepare American undergraduates for “global careers, and often lead to longer-term business relationships and economic benefits.” Follow The Telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:11:55.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
