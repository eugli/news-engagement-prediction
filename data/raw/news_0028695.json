Basically quarantine it and hold it away. \n\"It's thanks to small cavities inside the muscle fibres where calcium accumulates â€“ called vacuoles - that the damage high calcium levels would otherwise cause to vulnerable muscle is reduced.\" \n\"The soreness a person feels is the body saying it is fatigued, that the muscles are vulnerable and it's time to rest.\" \nDr Launikonis said vacuoles then disappeared until the next round of strenuous exercise occurred. \n\"Prior to this, no-one had any idea this mechanism was happening,\" he said. \nThe UQ team hoped its results would help better understand muscle wasting diseases like muscular dystrophy, however more research is needed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:02:22.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
