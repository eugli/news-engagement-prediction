Henson, Ryan Gosling, Halle Berry and many more Oscar presenters practice for the big show, many with family in tow. by Twitter Amy Adams presenting with Bill Murray at the 2014 Oscars. She will also present at this year’s ceremony. Taraji P. Henson knows how to seize an Oscar moment. On Saturday, during Oscar rehearsals at Hollywood’s Dolby Theater, the Hidden Figures star grabbed the wooden trophy the telecast crew uses as its prop Oscar and started to scramble off the stage with it. Henson was on hand with her costars, Janelle Monae and supporting actress Oscar nominee Octavia Spencer , to practice their presenting for Sunday’s show. But the trio clearly have their patter down—they vamped a Charlie’s Angels -style pose when the curtain rose and Henson, squinting out into the audience and failing to find her seat, declared, “My star is bigger than the room, dammit.” The Hidden Figures cast were among several stars who made the pilgrimage to the Dolby over the weekend, to polish their teleprompter reading and work on their stage walking for Sunday’s event. Actors like Dwayne Johnson , Scarlett Johansson , Halle Berry , Jennifer Aniston , Ryan Gosling , Vince Vaughn , Dev Patel , Felicity Jones , Riz Ahmed , Dakota Johnson , Jamie Dornan , Salma Hayek , Samuel L. Jackson , Brie Larson , David Oyelowo , Alicia Vikander , Mark Rylance , and Amy Adams passed through the theater, most of them clad in jeans or sweats, and often with family in tow. Many scrutinized the room to figure out where they’d be seated on show night. “Oh yeah! Octavia’s nearby!” Patel said. “I’m sitting up there,” Ahmed said, pointing to the nosebleed seats (he’s not). Adams and her six-year-old daughter, Aviana , arrived in matching T-shirts that said “Good Vibes Only.” As Aviana sat in the front row, Adams joked with a stage manager about raising a camera to a more flattering angle, then locked eyes on her daughter and mouthed “So silly.” When Aviana stumbled while trying to run up the stage stairs to her mom, Adams joked, “You’re like Jennifer Lawrence.” Oyelowo’s family made themselves comfortable in the Dolby, too. As a stage manager instructed the actor that the stage would open and a tiny camera would rise while he spoke, Oyelowo’s wife and four children scouted out his seat in the audience. “Oh hi Dad,” one son said, when he found his father’s picture in a seat. “Mommy, look behind you!” Oyelowo’s daughter gasped, as a glittering curtain appeared behind her father on the stage. When Leslie Mann took the stage to work out some banter, her husband, writer-director Judd Apatow , snapped a picture from the audience, and conferred with a member of the telecast’s crew about Mann’s script. Vaughn took a hand in writing, as well, improvising his category’s introduction and telling a stage manager, “I’ll have something written for that part tomorrow.” Some presenters were paired off with people they clearly know awfully well. As Gosling and Stone rehearsed a category together, the La La Land stars took turns saying “sibiliance” into the microphone. As a stand-in delivered a mock acceptance speech for their category, Fifty Shades Darker co-stars Johnson and Dornan counted down the time on the 45-second acceptance speech clock. “10,9,8...” Johnson began. “7,6,5” Dornan continued. Many of the women wore their show night shoes, to try out walking the stage in them. Jones was in blue suede pumps, Aniston in sparkly sling-backs, Berry in silver heels, her hair worn curly and long and face free of makeup. Larson, who will be under far less pressure this year as a presenter than last year as a nominee and eventual winner, arrived wearing what is becoming the ultimate Hollywood casual accessory—an ACLU T-shirt.
