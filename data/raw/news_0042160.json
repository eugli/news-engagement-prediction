(Photo: NBA on TNT) \nVictor Oladipo is a fantastic singer. He has prove it in the past, for instance, that time he performed Ain't No Sunshine several years ago. Oladipo has also pretended he has no idea how to sing for a great video with his Thunder teammate Russell Westbrook , who may or may not sing him to sleep some nights . \nAnyway, on Saturday at All-Star Weekend this year, there was an event that aired on TNT called the NBA Talent Challenge. Oladipo was one of the participants, and he sang a beautiful rendition of I Believe I can Fly . . @VicOladipo was soaring high with his take on @rkelly 's \"I Believe I Can Fly\" #OLADIPOTALENT pic.twitter.com/wtjkawXCsB — NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 18, 2017 \nOladipo also shared a bit about his singing background: \n\"I believe there's a song for everything, so anything that reminds me of a song, I'm gonna sing it on the spot. I'm weird. I sing at the spur of the moment. \n\"My sisters growing up, they hated it, I mean, not hated it, but I was really annoying because I sang everywhere. That was the only way I could practice. In the shower, anywhere, I used to sing, and they could hear it, so it was kind of annoying to them. But my mom was like, 'My son can sing, my son can sing,' so she always had my back.\" \nHe humbly added that if people don't think he sounds good he can just say, \"Well, I don't know how to sing, I'm a hooper anyway.\" \nThe guy can sing, though. He really can.
