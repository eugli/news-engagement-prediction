Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nSatisfaction with Mr Turnbull's performance fell four points to just 29 per cent and dissatisfaction rose by five points to 59 per cent. \nThe Prime Minister dismissed the poll as a \"snapshot of opinion at one particular time\" and made an unprecedented attack on his predecessor - who launched a scathing attack on the direction, policy prescriptions and performance of the Turnbull government in a speech last week. Advertisement \nMr Turnbull said Mr Abbott had delivered \"an outburst on Thursday and it had its desired impact on the Newspoll. It was exactly as predicted and as calculated\". \n\"He knew exactly what he was doing and he did it. I'm not going to be distracted by that. It's a fact of life. That's what's happened. I'm focused on the jobs of Australians that we are protecting by delivering the leadership.\" \nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann, a former Abbott loyalist, also blamed Mr Abbott's outburst for the fall in the government's standing, arguing \"people mark us down for that\". \nThe criticism of Mr Abbott underscores deep anger within Coalition ranks over the former leader's frequent, publicly critical commentary of the Coalition. However, government MPs also believe the Fair Work Commission's penalty rates decision played a part in the fall in the government's standing in the polls. \nAs one MP, who asked not to be named, put it, the government had no choice to accept the decision because the Coalition's core small business constituency had been calling for a cut to penalty rates for years - but \"make no mistake, this is bad for us\". \nLabor used every single one of its questions during question time to probe the government over the impact of the penalty rates decision, asking about the impact on women, on regional workers and on workers in other sectors, such as health professionals, in the future. \nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten demanded to know whether Mr Turnbull would move to stop the cut \"to the take-home pay of nearly 700,000 Australians. What is the Prime Minister going to do to stop this pay cut?\" \nLabor also attempted to introduce legislation to stop the decision from taking effect, as well as ensuring penalty rates could not be cut in the future, but was blocked. \nMr Turnbull fired back by pointing out that FWC president Iain Ross was a former ACTU official and had been appointed president by the Opposition Leader when he had been workplace relations minister. \n\"The Labor Party previously said we must respect the independent umpire and suggested we would not, well we do. And we have. It is the Labor Party that has changed. We respect the independent umpire's decision. \nMeanwhile, Australian Council of Trade Unions president Ged Kearney will fly into Canberra on Tuesday to step up union lobbying efforts to stop the cut. \n\" Fair Work rules can be changed â€” the umpire can be given a new set of rules to referee the game. The Prime Minister knows this but, based on his current comments, seems more interested in pandering to his big-business supporters than in protecting these workers. The government intervened when it has suited it do so in the past and now it must step in to protect Australia's lowest-paid workers from this savage pay cut.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:42:26.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
