DeMarcus Cousins (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:53 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:53 p.m. ET \nArguably the best big man in the NBA could be on the move. \nArizona Sports' John Gambadoro reported Tuesday the Kings could ship off three-time all-star center DeMarcous Cousins to the Suns in exchange for former first-round pick center Alex Len, small forward T.J. Warren, a first-round pick and possibly more. \nDespite the Kings' 19-29 record, 10th in the Western Conference, the 6-11, 270 pound Cousins is enjoying the finest season of his seven-year career. The Kentucky product is currently fourth in the NBA in scoring, averaging 28.4 points per game to go along with 10.6 rebound and 4.4 assists. He's also shooting 37.6 from 3-point range and nearly 80 percent from the foul line. \nCousins signed a four-year, $65-million extension in 2013. He's set to earn $16.7 million this season, but has never played in the playoffs. Cousins, who's long stated his desire to remain in Sacramento, could sign a deal worth over $200 million should the Kings offer him a max contract. \nMORE: NBA trade rumors \nThe Kings are in desperate need of a point guard after dealing Celtics All-Star Isaiah Thomas, whom they took with the final pick in the 2011 draft, to the Suns two years ago. Acquiring a first-round pick from the Suns, could give them the opportunity to pursue Washington's Markelle Fultz, N.C. State's Dennis Smith, Kentucky's De'Aaron Fox or UCLA's Lonzo Ball among others in the 2017 Draft. \nThe trade would reunite Cousins with fellow Alabamian point guard and former college teammate Eric Bledsoe and fellow Kentucky products Devin Booker, Tyler Ulis and Brandon Knight.
