I deserved it,\" Mundine told Fox Sports. \n\"But history will tell a different story. \n\"People know in their hearts ... they know who was the better man.'' \nThe scoring of the judge that awarded the fight to Green 98-90 was particularly mystifying in a largely even bout.

He (Green) knows I won it. That is what makes it so tough.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:37:08.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
