I don’t think they’ve had anything like this for a few years so they are keen as mustard.” \nKerr, 33, will play a series of one-off games for country teams in Victoria, NSW and Tasmania, much the same as Brendan Fevola has done in recent seasons. \nHe’s already been booked for 14 appearances. \nStewart said it would be good to get Kerr at the start of the season while his body was fresh and hoped he’d make an impact. \n“He’s still fit as a fiddle,’’ he said. \n“I don’t think he’s going to be there to sit in the forward pocket and sign autographs all day. By the sound of it he’s pretty keen to have a kick. \n“If he tells me he wants to have a run around in the middle of the ground I won’t be arguing with him, that’s for sure. I reckon he’ll be pretty hard to stop.” \nStewart said 40-year-old Hall’s presence up forward would make the Dales players walk taller in Round 2. \n“I don’t think I’d want to be the extra defender dropping in front of him,” he said. \nKerr will do a sportsman’s night in the Pearcedale rooms with Ricky Nixon after the game, while Hall will speak at a Pearcedale luncheon before his game. Tickets are available form the club. \nLast season, almost 5000 fans packed out Frankston Park to watch Fevola kick six goals for the Frankston Bombers on Good Friday. \n*Stars on show at Pearcedale: \nSaturday, April 8: Daniel Kerr. \nFriday, April 14: Barry Hall. \n— via Frankston Standard Leader", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:07:31.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
