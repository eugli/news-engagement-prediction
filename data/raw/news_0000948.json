They stomped up the front porch and pounded on the front door with their fists,” the former “Star Trek” star wrote for the New York Daily News. \n“Tears were streaming down my mother’s face as we left,” he said. “For my parents, it was a degrading, humiliating, terrifying experience.” \nMr. Trump’s executive order signed Friday   nations that have     country,   Takei said the order violates the U.S. Constitution and should be grounds for Mr. Trump’s resignation. \n“Donald Trump is the chaos President — and it’s time that he resign,” he wrote. “He has failed this country in less than two weeks on the job, decimating sacred American ideals and sparking momentous protests in our streets and airports.” \nAnticipating Mr. Trump’s order earlier this month, Mr. Takei started a petition on Care2.com opposing any policies that may target Muslims unfairly. It had garnered more than 257,000 signatures as of Wednesday morning. \n“When he previously called for a ‘total and complete shutdown’ of Muslims entering the U.S. in 2015, I invited him to see my Broadway musical ‘Allegiance,’ based on my personal experience as a child in two U.S. internment camps during World War II,” Mr. Takei wrote. “We reserved a seat for him every night. He never came. I wasn’t surprised. I was on his show ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ and know how stubborn he is. Part of education is having students willing to learn. He isn’t willing.” \nThe actor said he would be happy to accommodate Mr. Trump’s schedule if he would like a private viewing of “Allegiance” at the White House. \n“We would love for him to get a little education on this important chapter in history,” Mr. Takei wrote. “But it likely wouldn’t change his mind.” \n“He is ignorant, and because of his ignorance, he is fearful,” he said. “Actually, the real terrorist is Donald Trump. He’s the American terrorist.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T18:34:11.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
