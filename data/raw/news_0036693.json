Palaniswami won the confidence vote with 122 members in favour. \nThe House witnessed unceremonious scenes with the Speaker claiming he was attacked and DMK MLAs alleging they were assaulted by Assembly marshals. Cameras captured DMK working president and Leader of Opposition M.K. Stalin walking out of the Fort St. George with his shirt torn. \nThough the incidents are unfortunate in a democracy, they are not unprecedented. \nThe Assembly witnessed similar scene on January 28, 1988, when the Janaki Ramachandran-led government sought confidence of the House. \nSimilarities galore \nJust like how Speaker Dhanapal was forced to adjourn the House twice, the then Speaker P.H. Pandian too adjourned the House twice. \nMr. Dhanapal was forced out of his Chair, which was later occupied by DMK MLA Ku. Ka. Selvam. In 1988, Mr. Pandian was pushed away by a Congress(I) member. \nWhile Mr. Dhanapal came out asking “To whom can I complain now?”, Mr. P.H. Pandian faced the media with an injured left eye. \nWhile the cause of ruckus this time was the Opposition’s demand for a secret ballot, there were different reasons in 1988. \nMr. Pandian had informed the House that five Congress (I) MLAs had told him over telephone that they were resigning from the House. E.V.K.S. Elangovan, who later went on to become TNCC chief, was one of the members who had “resigned”. Mr. Elangovan, who was present in the House, was caught by the shirt by fellow Congress (I) MLA P. Venugopal. \nAs the Congress (I) alleged the ruling side was trying to create rift in their party, violence broke out among Congress(I), AIADMK and other MLAs. Mikes and paperweights were swung at each other. \nAs plainclothesmen made their way to the Assembly, the Jayalalithaa-faction of the AIADMK headed by P. Nedunchezhian trooped into the Well, surged past the Chair and tried to block their entry, and Mr. Pandian adjourned the House. \n‘Mock Assembly’ \nAmid the violence, Sivaraman, a Congress (I) leader occupied the Chair and “conducted” the proceedings. He “removed” Mr. Pandian as Speaker, “declared” the confidence motion was voted out and “adjourned” the House sine die. \nWhen Mr. Pandian was back in the House, Mr. Sivaraman too occupied the Chair and even sat on the Speaker’s lap. \nThen, policemen headed by Commissioner W. I. Davaram lathicharged the MLAs, cleared the chambers and chased everyone from the lobbies. \nThe House reassembled for the third time with ruling party MLAs and few Opposition members. Mr. Pandian declared the government had won the trust vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T16:20:55.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
