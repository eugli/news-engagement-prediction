The toddler was released at 9pm having been given the all clear by medical staff. \n“Given the circumstances, a detective-led review of safeguarding took place, but initial thoughts are that this was an accident with a miraculous ending. A follow up will be made to ensure that the landlord fixes the latch.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T11:40:05.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
