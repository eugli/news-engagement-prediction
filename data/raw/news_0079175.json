The actress seemingly channeled the Academy’s signature gold statuette for a head-turning aesthetic that melded the actress’ Choctaw heritage with a heady dose of glamour. Loading View on Instagram Biel’s gilded column dress—designed by Kaufman Franco—struck a sculptural note, culminating in a metallic collar formed of strips of gold that fanned out like feathers. Above the neck, the actress’ brunette was separated sleekly at center and pulled back into a low, super-polished take on the chignon that veered slightly to the left, with not a single hair astray. Rather than finishing the look with a scene-stealing bold lip, Biel’s makeup palette skewed peach, with lips, cheekbones, and lids saturated in a warm, burnished glow. And the final touch? Dramatic flicks of black eyeliner, which coupled with the glossy updo, imbued Biel’s earthy glamour with a touch of Elizabeth Taylor-like vamp. Biel's takeaway from Oscars 2017? Be your own eye-catching prize.
