We can't stop him from practicing but we want to put a dent in his business and try to force him out of here,” Robinson told CTV News Toronto at the animal hospital, located at Welland Avenue and Bunting Road.\nIt has remained closed since videos surfaced showing pets being choked, their noses with clippers and a cat under anesthetic being held by its legs and swinging it as it was taken into surgery.\n“I have yet to hear him say he is sorry. He never apologized publicly or privately,” Robinson said. “If you are not remorseful, then I think you get what you get.”\nAnother dog owner, Brandon Fairbairn, started a Go Fund Me campaign to hire a lawyer and launch a civil suit after he alleged his dog Takoda, an Alaskan Malamute, was abused.\nTakoda appeared in the video footage “multiple times,” according to the Go Fund Me page, when he was only four months old.\n“He shouldn’t be able to touch animals for the rest of his life, at least, or own one,” Fairbairn said at the protest.\nBack in September 2016, the veterinarian was handed a 10-month suspension by the College of Veterinarians of Ontario but because he completed a series of “mentorship sessions” to learn about the proper handling of animals, his sentence was reduced.\nThe Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said they are still investigating to determine whether they will lay animal cruelty charges against Rekhi.\nRelated Stories Suspension of St. Catharines vet was 'appropriate,' College of Veterinarians of Ontario says Photos Protesters gathered outside a St. Catharines animal hospital on Monday, Feb. 20, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:37:20.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
