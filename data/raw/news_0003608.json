The RSPCA are investigating what happened to her\n'Her coat was a horrible brown-grey colour when it should have been a beautiful cream and she had huge matted knots and dreadlocks in her coat, which had made her skin sore and bleeding.\n'The coat was so bad that the only option we had was to shave it all off. Once we'd removed the fur, it revealed a number of sores and wounds to her skin.\n'Vets believe her coat has been left to grow for a considerable length of time. Poor Rosie must have been so uncomfortable.\n'Bathing and grooming your pet dog is an important part of caring for them, just like walking them and taking them to the vets.\n'Rosie has not ended up like this overnight so must have been suffering for some time.'\nOfficers are now urging anyone who might recognise her or know where she has come from to get in touch with the RSPCA by calling their appeal line on 0300 123 8018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:43:54.582+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
