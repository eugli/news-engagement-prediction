The steep climb, following four different trails, usually takes 8 to 12 hours to ascend and another 4 to 6 hours to descend. Many climbers time their ascent so they are able to witness the rising sun from the summit. 4 Trails Ascend to Summit \nFour trails ascend Mount Fuji-Yoshidaguchi Trail, Subashiri Trail, Gotemba Trail, and Fujinomiya Trail. Ten stations are found on each trail, each offering basic amenities and places for resting. Drinks, food, and a bed are expensive and reservations are necessary. The 1st Stations are found at the mountain base, with the 10th Station on the summit. The usual place to begin is at the 5th Stations, which are reached by bus. Other mountaineering routes with technical climbing are found on Fuji. Most Popular Trail to Summit \nThe most popular way to the summit is on Yoshidaguchi Trail , which begins partway up at Kawaguchiko 5th Station on the east side of Fuji-san. It takes eight to twelve hours for the round-trip hike from here. Several huts are found by the 7th and 8th stations on the trail. Ascent and descent trails are separate. This is the best trail for novice climbers. Climb Mount Fuji in Two Days \nThe best way is to climb to a hut near the 7th or 8th station on your first day. Sleep, rest, and eat, and then climb to the summit early on the second day. Others begin hiking in the evening from the 5th Station, trekking through the night so the summit is reached at sunrise.
