The arctic freeze across Europe: and its on its way HERE! Monday, 9th January 2017 Europe is in the grip of an icy, arctic freeze. With snowfall in Italy, Greece and Turkey, we're expecting the snow to fall in Britain soon. 1 / 13 Getty Images A man walks on snow covered road during heavy snowfall in Istanbul. “These events disrupt the stratospheric polar vortex and, more often than not, bring cold weather to the UK” Met Office \nMet Office experts are warning of a possible Arctic blast in their February to April forecast. \nThey noted: “These events disrupt the stratospheric polar vortex and, more often than not, bring cold weather to the UK.” \nThe Met Office’s Professor Adam Scaife said: “Sudden Stratospheric Warming involves a complete reversal of the high altitude polar jet stream. \nGETTY BRRRR..: The cold snap is set to last for three weeks \n“This can burrow into the lower stratosphere. \n“The Atlantic jet stream often weakens and moves south. \n“This allows cold air from the east into northern Europe and the UK.” \nColder and drier conditions are predicted by the Met Office from the end of next weekend for up to three weeks. \nGETTY ARCTIC COLD: The bitter condition will be caused by a rare North Pole phenomenom \nBritain was last hit by a SSW in 2013 when we had the coldest March for 51 years, with snow and a -12.5C low in Braemar, Aberdeenshire. \nThe phenomenon also triggered -18C lows in Powys, Wales, in November 2010 – starting a monthlong freeze – and -18.4C temperatures in the Scottish Highlands in February 2009. \nMeanwhile, cold easterly winds from Russia dubbed ‘the Beast from the East’ will arrive on Wednesday and last until the end of the week. \nGETTY FREEZING: Eastern England will bear the brunt of the cold weather \nTemperatures could fall as low as -4C – colder than parts of Greenland – with a possibility of snow. \nMet Office forecaster Mark Wilson said: “The winds’ original source is Russia. \n“There is potential for the cold to reach the West later in the week, with perhaps snow on high ground. It looks like staying colder than average.” \nLast night, the Met Office warned western Britain could face a week’s rain tomorrow.
