(Jesse Johnston/CBC)\nThe Princess and Pea Wally Martin loves both wood and a good challenge and that's what lured him to the area in 1997.\nHe bought a rundown hotel on the corner against the advice of many.\n\"It was a complete wreck,\" he said.\n\"A couple of council members at the time thought it was ridiculous to save that old bucket and they just said to haul it to the landfill.\"\nMartin knew the Murray family built the hotel in the 1880s and he believed he could restore it.\n\"There were quite a few elements that were pretty authentically old, like the floors, siding and some of the exterior,\" he said.\nAfter much hard work, Martin opened the Princess and the Pea Bed and Breakfast and injected new life into the intersection.\nThe old Porter's General Store building has stood in Langley since the 1880s. (David Horemans/CBC)\nPorter's Around the same time Martin was starting his new business, Porter's General Store across the street was closing.\nThe Porter family opened the store in the 1880s, ran it for a century and then converted it into a coffee shop that closed sometime in the 2000s.\n\"When we first started there was a lack of spots where the community could come together,\" said Bill Buurmeester, who reopened the building in 2011 as Porter's Bistro Coffee and Tea House.\nThe cash register behind the counter is the same one used back in 1911.\nKaren and Bill Buurmeester wanted to create a community hub when they opened Porter's Bistro Coffee and Tea. (Jesse Johnston/CBC)\nThere are even a few old receipts stashed in the original wood cabinets.\n\"I think some people still owe Mr. Porter money,\" Bill's wife Karen said with a laugh.\nOn Friday and Saturday nights, Porter's hosts live music nights and members of the Fraser Valley Maker's Space upstairs come down to hang out.\nThe FV Makers gather on weekends to create things with 3D printers and sewing machines.\nPorter's is a community hub again, just like it used to be more than a century ago.\nOld meets new One of the few changes the intersection has seen this millennium is a relatively new roundabout, which replaced five stop signs.\nThere was talk a couple of years ago that it should be replaced with a traffic light but many people in the community wanted things to stay the same.\nChange, after all, doesn't come often to the intersection.\nThat was fine with the blacksmiths who hung out there 130 years ago and it's fine with FV Makers who use their 3D printer there today.\nKeep listening!
