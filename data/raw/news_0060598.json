(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT) \nNEW YORK—Celebrated Grammy Award winning violinist Joshua Bell wants virtual reality to help spread the love for classical music. \n“I think it’s an incredible visceral experience. I’d love to see VR sort of bring classical music to people who might not go initially to a concert hall or to Carnegie Hall. Eventually after seeing the VR I hope they do do that.” \nI spoke with the superstar artist at a Sony PlayStation event in Manhattan, where he was promoting the recent launch of the Joshua Bell VR Experience, a free download for PlayStation VR owners. \nDonning a PlayStation headset and Sony headphones, I got to experience this fully immersive 360-degree VR experience myself, which as a fan of the music, and of Bell, sells itself. \nYou’re brought inside Air Studios’ Lyndhurst hall in London with Bell, who performs Brahms’ Hungarian Dance No. 1 , accompanied by pianist Sam Haywood. \nPlayStation VR takes advantage of binaural audio processing technology and directional surround sound. As you move closer to Bell, you can hear the sound emanating from the violin in greater detail. As you retreat, the natural reverb of the hall takes over. \nThe experience made me want to hear more. \n“I’ve always felt live performance beats recordings,” Bell said, before joking not to tell Sony, for whom he has recorded around 25 albums through the years. “Now VR can bring you that feeling like you’re right there.” \nBell believes the medium can be used as a teaching tool as well, though for now there’s a challenge for a student wearing a headset to play a violin at the same time. \n“I would think there will be a way to do that in the future,” Bell says. “Maybe eventually the VR glasses will be inside on your eyeballs, give it five or 10 years, I don’t know.” Bell points out that classical music is already being taught online. “And so VR could take it to the next level. I would certainly be the first one to jump in and try that.” \nIndeed, Bell describes himself as a big technology and gamer person, though in putting together the VR experience, “all I had to do was really perform and (Sony) did their magic with these cameras and some work afterwards to perfect it…I’m excited about seeing some other people doing what I did so I can be right up there close.” Bell is also eager for VR to be used “to bring us right up next to sporting events and all kinds of other things.” \nIn the physical world, Bell treats guests to concerts in his home. He imagines at some point inviting others, virtually. “This might be a way in the future to let people be inside my home as well, because of that intimate experience which is different from Carnegie Hall.” \nEmail: ; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lA98f3 Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:57:32.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
