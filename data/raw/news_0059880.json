For the special performance, Sheeran started out with “Castle On The Hill,” and then went into “Shape Of You.” But partway through the latter, Stormzy came out to rap. \nThe singer had teased his performance at the 37th Brit Awards during an exclusive interview with BBC Radio 1’s Nick Grimshaw on Monday. “I’ve got two things dropping on Friday that are pretty interesting. One that gets debuted at the Brits, which I think people will go a bit nuts for,” Sheeran revealed. “It’s something that I think nobody is expecting. I think it’ll be decent. I’ve managed to keep it secret up until now, which is good. \nHe added, “But tomorrow night, I think we’re the penultimate act.” Clearly, Sheeran was hinting to both Grimshaw and listeners that he would not be performing solo during the event. Sure enough, he was joined on stage by his rapper pal, and they hugged when the joint performance ended. We can't get over how great ALL our #BRITs performers were... — BRIT Awards (@BRITs) February 22, 2017 \nSheeran previously took home the awards for Best British Male Solo Artist and British Album of The Year in 2015, and won the award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2012. His highly-anticipated new album, Divide , will be released on March 3. \nEd is also set to perform during this year's iHeartRadio Music Awards on Sunday, March 5th at The Forum in Los Angeles. The superstar affair will be televised live on TBS, TNT and truTV at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT and simulcast on iHeartMedia stations nationwide, as well as on iHeartRadio, the all-in-one digital music and live streaming radio service.
