'I would certainly consider myself to be one of them, people who are sexually active younger.' Yiannopoulos resigned from Breitbart on Tuesday after half a dozen employees threatened to leave over comments he made around pedophilia The comments cost him first a $250,000 book deal, then a prestigious conservative speaking engagement and finally his job as technology editor of Breitbart. Publisher Simon & Schuster said: 'After careful consideration, Simon & Schuster and its Threshold Editions imprint have canceled publication of Dangerous by Milo Yiannopoulos.' Earlier, Yiannopoulos was uninvited from the the Conservative Political Action Committee conference because of the controversial comments. He is now trying to bounce back by releasing his book through a new publisher, and it is likely he will be able to stay in the U.S. thanks to his undisclosed new media role.
