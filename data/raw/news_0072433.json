June last year to the discovery of her badly decomposed body in Victorian bushland on Monday. \nFrom her brother-in-law Vasko to her stepson Anthony, Ms Ristevski’s relatives have placed themselves under public scrutiny with their bizarre, attention-seeking antics.\nMs Ristevski’s body was found by a passer-by wedged between two logs off a dirt track near Loch Rd at Mount Macedon about 12.30pm on Monday.\nOn Tuesday it was revealed that a witness told police he saw a man with a shovel at the spot where Ms Ristevski’s remains were found.\nThe witness had quipped: “What did you do to the body?” but was met with an expressionless face from the man, whose description has not been released.\nThe date of this alleged encounter has not been publicly disclosed but at least one local resident, Ian Flannery, has told reporters he noticed a rancid smell in the area around August last year.\nMs Ristevski’s family members have always denied any involvement in her disappearance.\nIn December, police searched properties at Toolern Vale, Gisborne and Diggers Rest — just 30km from Mount Macedon — after tracking pings from both Ms Ristevski and husband Borce’s mobile phones on the day she vanished.\nMs Ristevski, 47, was last seen at her $1.1 million property on Oakley Rd in Avondale Heights on June 29 last year, according to her husband.\nPolice have not named Mr Ristevski as a suspect in his wife’s murder but his lawyer today conceded he was the prime suspect in her murder. \nMr Ristevski reportedly told family members he believed his wife may have been snatched by a stranger.\nMr Ristevski also dismissed claims by his estranged son Anthony Rickard, a confessed ice user, that he had overheard Mrs Ristevski saying she would leave Borce when their daughter Sarah turned 21.\nMr Rickard, approached Channel 9’s A Current Affair in August in an attempt to sell an unsubstantiated story. He had also made the claim on social media in posts that were later removed.\nMr Ristevski told detectives Karen went out to “cool off” about 10am following an argument about money but police have been unable to find CCTV footage or confirmation from independent witnesses that she left the property alive.\nIt later emerged that there were several inconsistencies in the version of events he told detectives under questioning, including allegedly “forgetting” that he had taken his wife’s car for a spin after she walked out to “assess a faulty fuel gauge”.\nHe allegedly amended his story after records tracked his mobile phone and also his wife’s mobile phone to the Calder Highway on the day she vanished. \nMr Ristevski’s son from a previous relationship, Anthony Rickard, and his nephew Chris Ristevski have both tried to sell their stories.\nMr Rickard, a 30-something, self-confessed ice user who moved in with his father and stepmother as a troubled teen, has made wild claims on Facebook he had an affair with Ms Ristevski.\nHe has told both The Australian and the Herald Sun that he feared the conflict arising from their relationship led to her disappearance but that he didn’t believe his father had done anything to hurt her.\nIn a bizarre Facebook rant last year, he claimed his father turned a blind eye to his addiction and “allowed Karen to continue her fantasy of leaving u (sic) to run away with me”.\nYet perhaps the oddest statements of all have come from Mrs Ristevski’s brother-in-law Vasko Ristevski.\nIt was Vasko who raised the frankly bizarre suggestion (quickly discounted by the cops) that Karen had somehow secured herself a “fake passport” and “run away” overseas after tensions between Anthony, her husband and herself reached boiling point.\n“I don’t think she will come back. I reckon she’s gone for good,” he told the Herald Sun . \nThen Vasko’s son Chris went on A Current Affair to defend the family against Anthony’s sordid allegations, describing his cousin as a “toxic” human being who took advantage of his aunt and uncle after they took him in.\n“He’s used everyone around him, he’s used Karen and Borce,” Chris told the program. “(They) have both given him cars, which he’s totally destroyed. Money, accommodation and he’s just abused it.”\nBorce and Karen Ristevski in happier times. Picture: Facebook Source: Facebook \nKaren Ristevski and her brother Stephen Williams. Picture Facebook Source: Facebook \nHER HUSBAND \nAs the husband, Borce Ristevski has always been the prime suspect in Karen’s murder.\nHe told police that on the morning of her June 29 disappearance, he and Karen had an argument about money and that she went for a walk to “cool off” but never returned.\n“That was the last thing she said to me; ‘I’m going to go and clear my head’,” Mr Ristevski told reporters when the family appealed for information at a July 13 press conference.\n“She has always walked back in the door after calming down.”\nMr Ristevski, his daughter with Karen, Sarah Ristevski, and sister-in-law Patricia Gray walked out of that presser minutes later after a Channel Seven reporter asked him point blank if he had killed his wife.\nBorce Ristevski told police his wife went for a walk to ‘cool off’ after an argument over money and never returned. Picture: Eugene Hyland Source: News Corp Australia \nHe allegedly stopped co-operating with police following an July 8 interview with detectives in which he denied having anything to do with her disappearance.\nIt has since emerged that there are several inconsistencies in the timeline Mr Ristevski allegedly conveyed to police regarding his movements on the day of her disappearance.\nAccording to the Herald Sun , he initially failed to mention that he had taken his wife’s 2004 Mercedes Benz for a drive down the Calder Highway in order to “assess a faulty fuel gauge”.\nHe later told police that the problem had fixed itself after the car hit a bump in the road and that he subsequently turned around and went home.\nIt later emerged that “pings” from Mr and Ms Ristevski’s respective mobile phones had been detected by transmitter towers along Melbourne’s Calder Highway on June 29, the day of her disappearance.\nThe Australian reported that Mr Ristevski told police he went for a drive just half an hour after his wife walked out of the house and was on the road from 10.30am until about midday.\nThe paper also claimed Mr Ristevski received a request to work from ride-sharing company Uber but was unable to confirm whether he accepted the job.\nHis claim that he saw Ms Ristevski leave the house cannot be corroborated by any other witnesses and he has since stated that security cameras at the family property stopped working months before his wife went missing.\nMr Ristevski’s lawyer Katarina Ljubicic said her client had not been asked to make any further statements to police beyond the two he had already completed.\n“He’s not been asked to make another statement and he’s fully co-operated with police,” Ms Ljubicic told The Australian .\nThe site where Karen Ristevski’s badly decomposed body was found off Loch Rd, Macedon Regional Park, on Monday. Picture: Nicole Garmston Source: News Corp Australia \nHER BROTHER-IN-LAW \nMs Ristevski’s brother-in-law Vasko offered up the most bizarre theories after she vanished.\nHe glibly told reporters that tensions between Borce, Anthony and Karen, and her embarrassment over her alleged inappropriate relationship with her stepson had prompted her to stage her own disappearance.\nHe also repeated Anthony’s claims that the marriage was in trouble and that she planned to leave Borce once their daughter Sarah turned 21.\n“I reckon she’s run away, ” He told the Herald Sun just weeks after Ms Ristevski vanished.\n“That’s my feeling, what with all the rumours going on about Anthony (Rickard).\n“She’s been going overseas to America and Hong Kong each month for the past 10 years on business, and I’m told it’s fairly easy to get a false passport.\n“I did put the rumours (about Mr Rickard) to Borce, but he said Karen’s not here to ­answer them. I don’t think she will come back, I reckon she’s gone for good.”\nVasco Ristevski visits Borce and Karen Ristevski’s family home in Avondale Heights a day after Ms Ristevski’s body was found. Picture: Mark Stewart Source: News Corp Australia \nHER STEPSON \nAnthony Rickard, Borce Ristevski’s son from a previous marriage, claimed early on that he and his stepmother developed an inappropriate relationship after the couple took him in as a troubled teen a decade ago.\nMr Rickard’s relationship with the rest of the family had long been a source of tension . The self-confessed ice addict had previously posted violent messages on social media and once offered to sell the family’s story to A Current Affair .\nKaren Ristevski’s stepson Anthony Rickard in a photoshoot with the Herald Sun last year. Picture: Alex Coppel Source: News Corp Australia \nThe television show said it offered him $50,000 in a “fake” deal but claimed he demanded $200,000. Mr Rickard denied asking for money, claiming producers offered him the cash.\nLast year, he made wild claims on Facebook that he and Ms Ristevski had an affair and that she planned to run away with him after her daughter Sarah turned 21.\nIn a rambling post which appeared to be addressed to his father, Mr Rickard called his father a “coward” and accused him of turning a blind eye to his drug-taking which “allowed Karen to continue her fantasy of leaving u (sic) to run away with me”.\nMr Rickard, who lives in Diggers Rest in Melbourne’s northwest, posted dozens of cryptic, sometimes violent comments and memes on his Facebook page after his stepmother went missing.\nOne said “so many idiots, so few bullets” while another revealed he was experiencing problems but they were “nothing violence won’t fix”.\nHis latest, posted on Tuesday night, a day after Ms Ristevski’s body was found, said: “What’s done is done, and what’s gone is gone. One of the life’s most valuable lessons is learning how to let go and move on.”\nMr Rickard has publicly stated that he did not kill Ms Ristevski and has also said he does not believe his farther would have hurt her.\nThe rambling post by Karen Ristevski’s stepson Anthony Rickard in which he claims she had plans to run away with him. Picture: Facebook Source: Facebook \nHER DAUGHTER \nSarah Ristevski, 21, reportedly severed contact with detectives last year in protest of her father’s alleged treatment by investigators as the prime suspect in her mother’s murder.\nShe clung to him and sobbed as the pair stormed out of a July 13 press conference with Ms Ristevski’s sister Patricia Gray after a Channel Seven reporter asked Mr Ristevski if he “had killed his wife”.\nSarah, who worked at Bella Bleu, Ms Ristevski’s struggling Broadmeadows clothing boutique, has also been dogged by rumours that she and her mother were not getting on in the weeks before she went missing. News.com.au is not suggesting Sarah has anything to do with her mother’s disappearance.\nBella Bleu closed in February last year and caveats had been placed on the Ristevski’s Avondale Height’s home by lenders after Mr Ristevski resorted to borrowing cash from a notorious Melbourne loan shark on at least two occasions.\nBorce Ristevski and his distressed daughter Sarah after they walked out of a press conference in which Mr Ristevski was asked of he killed his wife.
