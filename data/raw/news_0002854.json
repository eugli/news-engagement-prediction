It’s like that but with the leader of the free world and nukes,” Bee said during a special Facebook Live segment of Full Frontal With Samantha Bee . “If you disagree with the tenets of Trumpism, there is no place for you within the government.” \nTo drive her point home, Bee quoted Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who in referencing State Department officials who disagreed with Trump’s immigration ban: “They should either get with the program or go.” \n“It took Richard Nixon three years to compile his enemies list,” Bee said. “But in less than two weeks the Trump team has already called the media ‘the opposition party,’ fired an acting attorney general, pressured the chief of Customs and Border Patrol into resigning, purged the State Department of seasoned, career diplomats, kicked the director of National Intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs off the National Security Council; replaced them with some crazy dude he trusts, because why not? And accused Lindsay Graham and John McCain, the proprietors of the 66 remaining vertebrae among Senate Republicans, of trying to start World War III. Sorry, guys, at the rate Trump is going, you’ll probably have to settle for starting World War IV.” \nWatch the segment below.
