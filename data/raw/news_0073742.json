Before the N.W.T. government purchased NTCL's assets in December — effectively ending the shipping company's 85-year existence — NTCL shares were held by both IDC and Norterra.\nN.W.T. bought NTCL assets to preserve 'a lifeline' to remote communities\nHowever, the Inuvialuit people had no voting shares in NTCL, putting all of the power of the shipping company in Norterra's hands.\nThe same was true of Canadian North and Weldco-Beales; Norterra was the sole shareholder of those companies.\nBesides having voting power, Norterra oversaw the companies' budgets, investments and senior management recruiting.\nWith NTCL out of the picture and Canadian North and Weldco-Beales now fully owned by IDC, CBC News asked Mark Fleming, a vice president at IDC, about Norterra's future.\n\"Norterra is not dissolved and will remain a private holding company,\" he said.\nNorterra's website remained active for a period after NTCL's assets were purchased, listing Canadian North and Weldco Beales as its remaining subsidiaries.\nBut the website was offline this week.\nRead the full IDC release below.
