Web Report Filed on February 6, 2017 | Last updated on February 6, 2017 at 08.12 am Share Vote After Leonardo DiCaprio's blink-and-miss appearance, we hear Rihana was in the city First, it was Leonardo DiCaprio who made a blink-and-miss appearance in Dubai a couple of weeks back. The Hollywood star was pictured checking out some eco projects in the city and even found time to eat at French restaurant La Mome, Nassima Royal Hotel. Now we've come to learn that Rihanna was in town over the weekend - when we spotted a picture of hers on the Instagram account of Caribbean eatery Miss Lily's at Sheraton Grand Hotel, Sheikh Zayed Road. The singer clad in a fetching black and white striped outfit is pictured taking a selfie along with what looks like a happy fan. While we are mostly used to A-listers making a hue and cry about their visit to Dubai off late we have had many drop by without a whisper making it to the mainstream media. Not that we are complaining. Rihanna's last visit to the UAE was when she closed the Abu Dhabi F1 concert in November, 2016. Wonder who will be the next big star to visit out Emirate?
