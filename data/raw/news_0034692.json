But it just did thanks to the man, the myth, the legend, Chris Stapleton. \nToday Stapleton announced a brand-spanking new tour, including his first headlining show at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. \nStapleton’s All-American Road Show Tour will come to our state on May 23. Tickets go on sale Feb. 24 at 10 a.m. A pre-sale will go live to Citi card members on Feb. 21 at 10 a.m. \nCount me in! I am a pretty simple guy. I like all the things a normal younger guy likes… Beer, girls, good music, and having a good time. I also really like getting to do what I love, being on the radio! I grew up in Northern Colorado, and it’s honestly a dream come true to get to entertain my friends and family, while making new ones along the way, right in my backyard!
