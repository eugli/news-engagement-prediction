Parents Nicola and Kevin McCormack with Josh Read More Hundreds turn out to pay tribute to brave five-year-old Josh McCormack who died of cancer \nThere will also be a charity football match. \nEvent organiser Lexy Ellis said: “It is great that so many people are coming together to raise funds for such a vital cause and in honour of Joshua who was simply an inspirational and amazing young man. \n“We’re hoping to raise as much as possible for Derian House and for Joshua’s family and to show our support for everyone affected by this disease.” \nJoshua passed away on January 13 and his mum Nicola invited friends to celebrate his life in an emotional post on Facebook. \nShe wrote: “My best friend has gone and it’s final. \n“Life will never be the same and we now have to live with grief for an eternity. \n“One final thing we have to do as parents (which no parent should have to do) is arrange the best send-off ever for the best, most charismatic and caring son.

Our dream came true with Joshua but lasted only 5 short years..the last of which cancer made our perfect dream become a living nightmare.” \nOn the day of his funeral hundreds of mourners lined the streets to pay their respects, with Darth Vader and a collection of stormtroopers leading his funeral cortege through Whitworth. \nJoshua was a huge Rochdale FC fan and staff, players and manager Keith Hill stood with their heads bowed as the hearse passed the football club on its way to St John’s Church in Whitworth. \nHe was named as a substitute for a match last November and the club retired the squad number he was assigned – 55 – in tribute after his death was announced. \nRaffle tickets and donations for the event on February 26 can be purchased by emailing superherojosh@hotmail.com via paypal.
