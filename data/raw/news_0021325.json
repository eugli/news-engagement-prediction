In addition to producing original video content, iDubbbz has made guest appearances in collaboration with other YouTube personalities, most notably Filthy Frank and Maxmoefoe . Online History \nOn August 30th, 2012, iDubbbz posted the first video to the iDubbbzTV YouTube channel, in which he is shown playing the game Overgrowth . In the beginning of his YouTube career, iDubbbz built his audience base through a series of Let’s Play -style walkthroughs and video game commentaries, before shifting his focus to more in-depth commentaries on social media trends and analysis of YouTube’s vlogging subculture with the launch of Kickstarter Crap in March 2013, followed by the premiere of Content Cop in December 2015. Many of his early videos have since been removed from the channel. As of February 2017, iDubbbzTV has more than 3.5 million subscribers on YouTube. Highlights Kickstarter Crap \nKickstarter Crap is a web series in which iDubbbz mocks and criticizes a variety of poorly conceived campaigns and projects found on the online crowdfunding platform Kickstarter . He later launched the spin-off series Indiegogo Excrement , investigating similar crowdfunding campaigns on Indiegogo. Content Cop \nContent Cop is a satirical web series in which iDubbbz offers his criticism and honest review of popular channels and content creators on YouTube. Each episode of Content Cop opens with a comedy sketch of iDubbbz dressed in a police uniform chasing after and bringing down a suspect, before cutting to iDubbbz’ production studio where he rants about the YouTube content creator in question at length. Since its premiere on December 13th, 2015, which featured a review of YouTube reaction vlogger Jinx (shown below), iDubbbz has released a total of ten Content Cop episodes on several celebrity vloggers, including Leafy, Keemstar and The Fine Bros, as well as popular subgenres of original video content on YouTube, such as hidden camera pranking , unboxing and other consumer product reviewers.

Controversies Feud with Leafy \nOn September 12th, 2016, iDubbbz released an episode of Content Cop in which he roasts the popular YouTube vlogger Leafy for having a “weak chin” complex, speculating that Leafy seems to be trying to hide the lower end of his face when posing for photographs (shown below). Within 48 hours, the video gathered upwards of 4.9 million views and 120,000 comments. In the following days, Leafy began to lose his subscribers en mass at a rapid rate, presumably as a result of iDubbbz’ Content Cop episode.
