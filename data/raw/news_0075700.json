We connected instantly. That very first day I knew Zach would be the face of the story I was searching for.' Zach lives in a cabin with a family of fisherman, Eric and his wife Cindy, who all work together on a floating oyster farm. Marble Island is so remote that Zach, pictured doing jobs around his cabin, sometimes goes six months without seeing a single human outside of the family The island, which is surrounded by whales and populated with prowling bears, is only reachable by boat or float plane Every couple of months, Eric and Zach venture back to civilisation to stock up on gas for the generators, the only source of power they have, and food they can't grow or hunt. Most of their vegetables, however, grow in their garden and forest, and all their meat - deer, halibut and oysters - they hunt themselves. This water is sourced from a small creek, which they collect in a tank. The island has no roads or phone service, and the nearest town is Ketchikan a two-hour flight away. Pictured is Zach on his boat with his dog Kahli He caught this rockfish one afternoon during a boat trip with Mr Osterman, and they later enjoyed it for dinner back at the cabin Mr Osterman tells MailOnline Travel: 'Zach was the first person I saw when the float plane landed in a Tokeen cove, which is a part of Marble Island where he and the Wyatt family live.' Pictured, an abandoned loggers camp on the island Zach saying goodbye to Cindy as he is dropped off for a long day of solitary work one early foggy morning Before spending time on Marble Island, Mr Osterman confesses he was confounded as to why anyone would choose to live so far from society. That soon changed, he says. 'You get the feeling, existing in a place with such a powerful history and untouched wilderness, that this is real life. Like you are not a fish in a tank anymore, you are free. 'All the anxiety just evaporates.' Rocks like this present a big danger to Zach and his boat due to the fast-changing tides, which rise six feet in the evening Zach pictured taking care of the oysters, ensuring they grow correctly from their baby size all the way to selling size Every couple of months, Eric and Zach venture back to civilisation to stock up on gas for the generators, the only source of power they have, and for food they can't grow or hunt Most of their vegetables, however, grow in their garden and forest, and all their meat - deer, halibut and oysters - they hunt themselves.
