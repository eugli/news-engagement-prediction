Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nHis brother-in-law, Peter Georgiou, placed as the number two candidate for One Nation, is considered most likely to fill the vacancy, with Mr Culleton having previously vowed to serve as his chief-of-staff. \nMr Culleton quit One Nation in early December, amid reports of a growing rift between himself, and party leader, Pauline Hanson, which emerged after Senator Hanson gave her party's support to the government motion referring Mr Culleton's election to the High Court, Under section 44 of the constitution. Advertisement \nIn their judgement, the justices found that Mr Culleton was not eligible to stand for the senate at the time of his election, because he had been convicted and subjected to be sentenced for an offence which carried a year or more imprisonment. \nThat related to a larceny charge from New South Wales over a dispute with a tow truck driver in 2014, who arrived to repossess property from Mr Culleton's property, resulting in the loss of what Mr Culleton referred to as \"a $7.50 key\". Mr Culleton had been convicted in his absence by the Armidale court in March 2016, but in August, following the election, won in his bid to have the conviction annulled.
