TMZ reports that the incident took place around 3 a.m. and was not on the premises of the live stream. \nAs noted on its website , \"He Will Not Divide Us\" is straightforward in its scope: The project encourages participants to stare into the camera and repeat \"He will not divide us\" as many times as they wish. After an altercation with a protester in New York ended with LaBeouf facing assault charges in January, the Museum of the Moving Image \"abandoned\" the project. LaBeouf then relocated the live stream to New Mexico, as the intention behind \"He Will Not Divide Us\" was to film participants throughout the duration of Trump's presidency. \nAs of 11:30 Thursday morning (February 23), the live stream was still dark.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:36:35.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
