(Supplied: BioViva) \nIn the last couple of years, researchers have extended the life of mice by up to 40 per cent through various means including gene therapies. \nHuman trials are a long way off because of tight government regulations, but many researchers have started experimenting on themselves. \nIn 2015, American genetics activist Liz Parrish flew to Colombia to avoid US regulatory constraints. \nOnce there she says she injected herself with an unproven anti-ageing gene therapy. \nMs Parrish, the CEO of biotechnology company BioViva, is now known as Patient Zero. \nShe says results show the treatment rejuvenated part of her DNA, called telomeres, that shorten with age, and she claims her telomeres have now grown by 9 per cent, or about 20 years. \nMany scientists question her claims. Meet the grinders Photo: Meow-Ludo Meow-Meow is microchipped. (ABC: Brant Cumming) \nGrinders or biohackers are people who augment their bodies with technology. \nThis could be as crude as implanting magnets under your skin — a procedure that can be done at some tattoo and body piercing studios — or slightly more high-tech like getting microchips placed inside your body. \nMr Meow-Meow has a micro-chip implanted in his left thumb and has downloaded some smartphone functions directly into his body. \n\"I can open doors, authenticate myself to my credit card, activate my phone, activate drones and I can program the chip in my thumb from my phone anytime,\" he said. \nUS grinder Rich Lee has more than seven implants, including magnets in his finger tips which twitch in response to electro-magnetic fields. \n\"You can feel it because all those nerves in your fingertips have grown around the magnet and it has a texture and you're feeling this otherwise invisible world,\" he said. \nMr Lee also has magnets in his ears which serve as earphones: \"being able to hear through walls is cool.\" Isn't there a huge risk of infection? \nYes. \nAnd Mr Meow-Meow warns would-be biohackers against trying to implant themselves with DIY kits. \n\"Anything that's put under the skin provides an environment in which bacteria can grow,\" he said. \n\"This is why it's very important that you go and see a professional.\" Is this the dawn of a new species? \nHmmm. \nAside from physical modifications, the race is also on to reach a new, super intelligence. \nBillionaire Elon Musk wants to develop a neural lace which would layer onto the human brain and connect digitally to AI. \nWithout it, he says humans will risk becoming like a \"house pet\", because AI will eventually outstrip human intelligence — perhaps this century. \nMr Xing says all this is vital so humans don't lose their jobs to robots and it will also help us adapt to space travel. \n\"The question is at what point does the incorporation of all this technology make us a different species and what are the ethics behind that?\" \nWatch Margot O'Neill's report tonight on Lateline at 9.30pm on ABC News 24 or 10.30pm on ABC TV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:58:44.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
