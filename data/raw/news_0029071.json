He is among seven left-handers on the Cardinals’ spring roster.\nSchafer played last season in the Dodgers organization, spending most of the season at Double-A Tulsa, but had a brief stint at Triple-A Oklahoma City.\nHe was 1-1 with a 3.15 ERA for Tulsa, making 31 appearances, including one start. In 40 innings, Schafer showed an ability to make batters miss his pitches, striking out 46. He also allowed 41 hits and walked 17 for a 1.45 WHIP.\nHis time at Oklahoma City was marked by difficulty. He made six appearances, all out of the bullpen, and did not register a decision. His ERA was 9.95, and he allowed 15 hits in 6 1/3 innings, but he struck out seven and did not allow a walk.\nSchafer is a long shot to make the Cardinals’ 25-man roster, given that Brett Cecil and Kevin Siegrist likely will serve as the Cardinals’ lefties out of the bullpen this season, so Schafer probably is playing for another chance at Triple-A.\nThe Cardinals’ affiliate is the Memphis Redbirds, who play in the Pacific Coast League. That would mean no appearance at Coolray Field in Gwinnett County, unless it’s in the postseason.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:27:53.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
