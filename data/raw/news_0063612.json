SWNS:South West News Service An amphibian army has taken over the home of Nicole Kirby, 15, and her dad SWNS:South West News Service 2 The youngster said that by day around 50 of them can be seen leaping around the garden \nThe youngster, who lives in the property with her dad, said that by day around 50 of them can be seen leaping around the garden. \nBut at night the duo are greeted by 200 of the croakers blocking the way to their back door. \nThe exasperated family say all they wants is a quiet life and are at a loss to know what to do. \nThey have even tried to enlist the help of pest control but were told they don’t deal with frogs. \nNicole said: “There has been a lot of frogs taking over the house for about two weeks now. \n“I don’t know where they came from. They are just keeping dad awake at night. \n“It is hard to explain what kind of noise they make. It is just really constant. \n“It’s not like we’ve got a problem with frogs. \n“I thought they would disappear after the first few nights, but now I don’t think they’ll ever go.” \nThe family, who have lived in the Plymouth Community Homes-owned property or six months, first noticed the frogs when he was getting ready for work about two weeks ago. Brave frog dad defends unborn young from killer wasps on Planet Earth II \nRecalling the moment they were first faced with the croakers - which all seem to be mating - Nicole said: \"We spotted one, then I saw another, then another, and then another one. They were everywhere. \n\"There was about 40 altogether and we thought somebody was playing a practical joke. \n\"Then when my dad was getting home from work, he saw them all up the steps. \n\"There were hundreds; it was bizarre. \n\"At first it wasn't a problem, but now they are keeping my dad up at night. He has to turn on the television just to drown out the noise. \n\"The other morning he was walking up the steps to my back door and nearly slipped on one and broke his ankle.\" \nWhen the frog problem didn't get any better, the family got in touch with their housing provider to see if there was anything they could do.

To me they are a pest. \n\"I really don't know where they have come from. It seems like we've got every frog from the St Budeaux estate in my back garden. \n\"It feels like there is a banner up saying 'Frog party here'.\" \nAlthough the family didn't know the previous owners of the house, they did know there used to be a small pond in the back garden. \nThe dad, 40, who asked not to be named, said: \"It was filled in before I got here, but surely they can't all be from that pond, because there is absolutely hundreds of them. \n\"It's not like I'm losing my hair over it; I am tolerating the problem at the moment, I just want to know what I can do to get rid of them.\" \nHe added: \"At the moment they look like they are mating, and some of them are pregnant - that means there is going to be a lot of spawn, but I don't want it all here.\" \nWe pay for your stories!
