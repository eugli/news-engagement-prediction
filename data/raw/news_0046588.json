In response, this group of opponents launched a campaign to educate Texans on the consequences the bill would have, and what they can do to stop it. “You’ve got to roll up your sleeves, pull down your pants, and pee with LGBT,” the ad says.\nA social media campaign follows the ad, using #IPEEWITHLGBT and #StopSB6. — ACLU of Texas (@ACLUTx) February 20, 2017 \nWatch our new ad opposing Texas' bathroom bill we did w/ @aclutx . You've gotta take a seat to make a stand. #SB6 https://t.co/VX1ue0u5Eo — Legacy Community (@LegacyCommunity) February 20, 2017 \nBy the click of a button, the website’s users are taken to a page with an editable, pre-typed email, ready to be sent to Texas lawmakers to show disapproval of the bill. The form requires an address so it knows which upper chamber representatives the email should be sent to. Citing a statistic that nearly 70 percent of transgender people experience threats and harassment in the bathroom, the campaign’s website aims to discredit the claim that bathroom bills protect anyone. \nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick is a strong advocate for the proposal, referring to it as a “ common sense ” privacy bill to “protect” all Texans. \nThough the ad is obviously humorous, it discusses the economic harm that would come from the bill, based off of the backlash the state has already received and the experiences from other states. \nNorth Carolina has taken a serious financial blow totaling to around $1 billion because of HB2’s effects on the state’s businesses. The NBA has already threatened to overlook Texas for future events if the bill passes. \nSB6 was sent to the Senate State Affairs last month, and another date for hearings hasn't been set yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:15:20.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
