Jimmy Garoppolo (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 10:25 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 10:25 a.m. ET \nJimmy Garoppolo's fate rests in the hands of the New England Patriots, who this offseason may or may not trade the 25-year-old quarterback to a team willing to part with adequate compensation. \nThe rumors seem nonstop, with teams like the 49ers, Bears and Browns bubbling as possible trade partners for the Patriots. Such is a late-February tradition in the National Football League. \nGaroppolo, who's entering his fourth NFL season and the final year of his rookie contract, insists he's able to tune out the majority of the noise — majority being the key word. \nESPN's Adam Schefter on his \" Know Them From Adam \" podcast recently spoke with the New England quarterback and brought up a variety of topics. But when the trade subject inevitably came up, Garoppolo admitted Schefter's \"guess is probably as good as (his).\" \nMORE: Best fit for Garoppolo is ... \nGaroppolo seemed sincere when he told Schefter the trade rumors have minimal effect on his everyday life. \n\"For the most part I’m just trying to stay level-headed, try not to over think it too much,\" Garoppolo said. \"Because at the end of the day I’m still under contract. It’s not my decision if I get traded or if I don’t. So you try to take it all in stride. \n\"When you really start thinking about it, your head will start spinning.\" \nWhile Garoppolo \"tries\" to ignore the speculation, his mother is the reason he \"can't do it completely.\" He said she and his father are too excited about their son's NFL standing not to keep a close eye on the reports. \n\"She's all over that stuff ... she could be your assistant,\" Garoppolo told Schefter. \"(My parents) know what to hit me with and what to keep quiet. The know me so well, they know what I’d like to hear and what I don’t need to hear. There’s a couple slip-ups here and there, not gonna lie.\" \nSchefter of course asked Garoppolo about his potential trade destinations. Chicago — he grew up in the Windy City suburbs and went to college at Eastern Illinois — is one of them. \n\"It’s hard to say,\" Garoppolo said when asked what it'd be like to return to the area as a Bear. \"I really don’t know how it’d feel.\" \nHis answer was similar for the other locations: \"I know it’s a very cliche answer. I’ve only been in Foxborough, so I don’t know anything different in the NFL yet.\" \nMORE: Why Garoppolo is worth a first-rounder \nAll this, of course, could be for nothing. The Patriots could call Tom Brady's I-want-to-play-forever bluff and keep Garoppolo. It's their obligation to do so if they think he's a franchise-caliber quarterback. Pats wide receiver Julian Edelman certainly believes that's the case . \nBut Brady's insistence makes Garoppolo the NFL's hottest trade commodity, as SN's Vinnie Iyer explained last week. To him, San Francisco makes the most sense as a trade partner for New England. \nSchefter's entire interview with Garoppolo is worth a listen.
