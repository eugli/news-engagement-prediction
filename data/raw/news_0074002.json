He was 33 points ahead of Jorge Lorenzo and on course to make history – which he did – when Lorenzo went on a three-race winning streak to end the season and make it a much closer finish than anticipated. \nMárquez finished third in Valencia, the final race, and clinched the title by just four points. \nThe drama came in Moto3, where just five points were the difference across three riders; Luis Salom, Maverick Viñales and Àlex Rins. The trio all started from the front row of the grid. \nSalom’s luck deserted him and he crashed, limping across the finish line in 14th, but Viñales and Rins took it all the way to the chequered flag. Rins went up the inside of Viñales into the final corner to take the lead, but Viñales fought right back and held it to the chequered flag for the most dramatic of conclusions.

It was the Frenchman who only just had his nose in front in the standings, as they lined up alongside one another at the front of the grid for a winner-takes-all duel at Phillip Island. \nThe race was a tight affair, and the pair were stuck together for its entirety. As they rounded the final corner with Nakano in front, Jacque remained tucked into the Japanese rider’s slipstream and popped out on the straight, winning the race by just 0.014 seconds in one of the closest finishes ever. Loris Capirossi chases down Tetsuya Harada © Getty Images 250cc in 1998: Loris Capirossi \nOne of the most controversial finishes to a World Championship in the sport’s history, this was more WTF! than cliffhanger. \nIt had the makings of a thriller with Italian Capirossi arriving at the final round in Argentina leading fellow Aprilia rider Tetsuya Harada by four points in the 250cc championship. \nCapirossi knew that finishing in front of Harada would deliver him the title, and he simply rammed the Japanese rider off the track. Capirossi went on to finish the race in second, but was then disqualified for his manoeuvre. \nIt didn’t affect his championship win though, because by preventing Harada from scoring points he’d accomplished his mission of sealing the title. Capirossi was fired by Aprilia soon after. Marc Márquez and Valentino Rossi in Qatar © Dorna Sports MotoGP in 2015: Jorge Lorenzo \nA very testy end to the 2015 MotoGP World Championship saw Valentino Rossi arrive at Valencia knowing he needed a lot to go his way in order to claim the crown. \nThe Italian had been handed a back-of-the-grid penalty for what went down in Malaysia in the previous round, so had the odds stacked against him. His rival for the title Jorge Lorenzo started from pole position, to make the proposed feat even more herculean. \nRossi gave it his all, making his way up to fourth place, but victory for the Spanish rider decided the title in his favour.
