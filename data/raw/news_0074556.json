The actress hit the Oscars red carpet with husband of 20 years Judd Apatow in an almost identical gown to Belle’s. The chartreuse number was designed by Zac Posen — and his inspiration seemed obvious. While Mann looked a lot like Belle, others compared best actress nominee Emma Stone to another “Beauty and the Beast” character, Lumière, the candlestick, in her gold, glittering Givenchy gown. Actress Shay Mitchell also posted a photo of herself resting while getting ready for the Elton John viewing — and wearing a Belle-like yellow gown as well.
