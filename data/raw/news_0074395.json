The FC crew discuss the evident disconnect between Claudio Ranieri and the Leicester players leading up to his sacking. Jurgen Klopp likens Ranieri's sacking to other recent decisions surrounding Brexit and Trump. Jamie Vardy has joined Kasper Schmeichel in denying any involvement in Claudio Ranieri's sacking as Leicester boss.\nRanieri left the club on Thursday only nine months after guiding the Foxes to a remarkable Premier League triumph. Reports suggested that several senior players at Leicester met with the owners to criticise Ranieri's methods.\nBut Vardy and Schmeichel both insisted on Saturday that they had nothing to do with the decision.\nVardy was one of the many rough diamonds Ranieri polished, with the striker's form for Leicester earning him a place in the England team.\nWriting on Instagram, Vardy said: \"I must have written and deleted my words to this post a stupid amount of times! I owed [it to] Claudio to find the right and appropriate words!\n\"Claudio has and always will have my complete respect! What we achieved together and as a team was the impossible! He believed in me when many didn't and for that I owe him my eternal gratitude.\n\"There is speculation I was involved in his dismissal and this [is] completely untrue, unfounded and is extremely hurtful! The only thing we are guilty of as a team is underachieving which we all acknowledge both in the dressing room and publicly and will do our best to rectify.\n\"I wish Claudio the very very best in whatever the future holds for him. Thank you Claudio for everything.\"\nA post shared by Jamie Vardy (@vardy7) on\nFeb 25, 2017 at 11:33am PST Earlier, Schmeichel insisted reports of a meeting between the club's owners and several players that led to Ranieri's dismissal were untrue.\nHe told the BBC: \"There's absolutely no truth in that whatsoever. We are players and we can only affect [things] on the pitch. What happens above our heads at boardroom level is completely out of our control.\n\"All these reports about meetings, I don't know where they've come from. What I can say is our owners are very hands on, they are in and around the club all the time.\n\"They come to practically every game, they come to the training ground and they speak to all the players regularly. We talk to them about all manner of things from the weather to the pitches to whatever.\n\"These guys are very successful businessmen and have taken this club from the bottom of the Championship to the top. They're not going to let themselves be influenced by any players.\"\nLeicester lost 2-1 against Sevilla in the Champions League, but scored a crucial away goal courtesy of Jamie Vardy, before Ranieri was sacked on Thursday night.\nThe 30-year-old Dane, who is the son of Manchester United legend Peter, added: \"Claudio leaving is obviously very, very sad. We achieved the impossible together and I have nothing but the utmost respect for him for everything he achieved at this club. I have no problem with Claudio whatsoever.\n\"As everyone knows, he's a classy guy. He came in and said his piece to the players, thanked us for our efforts and for last season and said goodbye. It's a shame it's come to this.\n\"You could hear that it hurt him and it hurts the players that we haven't performed well enough to make this carry on. We're in the position we're in because we haven't been good enough, it's as simple as that.\"\nRanieri visited Leicester's training ground on Saturday morning to say goodbye to his former players and staff, while playmaker Riyad Mahrez and captain Wes Morgan both took to Twitter to thank Ranieri.\npic.twitter.com/s1jgjGqdip\n- Riyad Mahrez (@Mahrez22) February 25, 2017 Mahrez posted a picture of him with the Italian Quote: : \"Big respect to this great man who helped us achieve history, you helped me build myself as a player and gave me the courage I needed.\n\"You believed in me from day one. Huge thank you for everything and good luck. God bless.\"\nMorgan said: \"Would just like to say a big thank you to Claudio for what was achieved at Leicester and becoming Premier League champions and competing in the Champions League. This is something I'd never thought was possible and it happened. It was a pleasure to be your captain and I wish you all the best in the future.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Mahrez22/status/835514983379267584", "https://t.co/s1jgjGqdip", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/2951563/claudio-ranieri-sacked-leicester-city-players-jamie-vardy/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ8kq-whcOH/", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i/?img=/media/motion/ESPNi/2017/0223/int_170223_WATCH_The_best_of_Claudio_Ranieri/int_170223_WATCH_The_best_of_Claudio_Ranieri.jpg&w=738&site=espnfc", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i/?img=/media/motion/ESPNi/2017/0224/int_170224_INET_FC_Ranieri_Discussion/int_170224_INET_FC_Ranieri_Discussion.jpg&w=738&site=espnfc", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i/?img=/media/motion/ESPNi/2017/0224/int_170224_inet_fc_klopps_funny_statement_on_trump/int_170224_inet_fc_klopps_funny_statement_on_trump.jpg&w=738&site=espnfc"], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:10:33.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
