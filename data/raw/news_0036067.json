Wenger’s side face a daunting trip to Bayern Munich (Picture: Getty) \nWright feels that lack of versatility to Arsenal’s tactics has hurt them in the big games, despite also praising Wenger for giving the team more of an attacking edge in his time at the club. \n‘Arsenal feel much more comfortable with ball,’ Wright told Suddeutsche. ‘Pushing up, pushing up spaces and conquering the ball is not their game. \n‘This is the hard part of football which nobody likes to do (in) this team. A good six-meter sprint at the front can save you the 30-meter-way further back, but from Arsenal we see that only in the first few minutes of games, if at all.
