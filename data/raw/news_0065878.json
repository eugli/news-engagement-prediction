'It's a holy grail for a broadcaster, and I'm really looking forward to working with Emma, who I'm a big fan of, and celebrating a brilliant year of British music.'\n'To present the BRITs is an honour but to be doing it alongside one of my absolute favourites, Mr Dermot O'Leary is just bonkers. Bring on the BRITs 2017,' added Emma.\nLittle Mix and Grime artist Skepta lead the nominations pack with three apiece - with many critics wondering if the North London-born MC can replicate his prestigious Mercury Music Prize win and scoop the British Album of The Year prize for Konnichiwa.\nHappy! She wasn't completely serious on her way in, flashing a bright white smile as she soaked up the atmosphere at the jewel in the British music calendar crown\nBut he has stiff competition from the late David Bowie whose last album Blackstar is up for the gong, as well as fan favourite The 1975 whose memorably titled album I Like It When You Sleep For You Are Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It, topped both the U.S. and UK charts.\nSkepta will also go up against firm favourite Bowie in the Best British Male category, while fellow nominee Craig David is convinced he won't win the award.\n'David Bowie's career has been so epic,' he told BBC News . 'He influenced me and so many other artists. There's no competition.'\nLittle Mix - and bandmember Perrie Edwards - have a battle of their own, with Perrie's ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik both nominated for Best British single - Zayn for R&B style Pillowtalk and Little Mix for their hit Shout Out To My Ex, which fans believe is partly written about the former One Direction star.\nInterestingly, Beyonce goes against sister Solange for the Best International Female gong, although they both face stiff competition from rising star Christine And The Queens, Rihanna and Sia.\nSolange, who considers Beyonce a role model, released her album A Seat At The Table just three days before her thirtieth birthday last year, to critical acclaim.\nA night to remember: That smile will no doubt be even wider if Little Mix's Shout Out To My Ex beats Zayn's Pillowtalk to the Best Single gong\nIt became her first number-one album in the US, making she and Beyonce the first sisters to have US number-one albums in a calendar year.\nMeanwhile, Best British Female Solo Artist will be fought out between Anonhni, Ellie Goulding, Emeli Sande, Lianne La Havas and Nao.\nAdele will be hoping to replicate a tiny slice of her recent Grammy success by scooping the British Artist Video Of The Year award for Send My Love (To Your New Lover).\nHowever, she faces a tough contest with Calvin Harris Feat. Rihanna, whose video for This Is What You Came For has been a frontrunner with the bookies.\nHere come the girls: The feisty pop star joined her bandmates Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall and pouted up a storm for the cameras\nBlues Singer Rag 'N' Bone Man has already secured his first BRIT, scooping the Critics Choice gong - one of two awards already announced.\nThe award - given to artists tipped for the top - is held in high regard, having previously been presented to Adele, Sam Smith and Florence + The Machine.\n'I thought they had made a mistake. I was up against two pop giants. It’s bloody brilliant! I'm crazy happy. Proper massive grin,' he said about his win when it was announced last year.\nBattling it out: Both acts face stiff competition from the likes of James Arthur, Coldplay and Calvin Harris\nAll eyes on them: The girls unsurprisingly drew plenty of attention upon arrival\nAnd Robbie Williams will accept the BRITs Icon Award - which provides him with his 18th BRIT award win, either as a solo artist or member of Take That.\nThe singer seemed a little bemused at being selected to receive the prestigious prize, which sees him follow in the footsteps of Elton John and David Bowie.\n'There’s so much in my career where I look into the abyss and the abyss looks back and goes: \"I don’t know, I don’t have a f**king clue,\"' he recently told NME .\n'How have I got 18 BRITs and Paul McCartney hasn’t? Something weird has happened... Me having 18 BRITs – it’s like there’s a glitch in the Matrix.
