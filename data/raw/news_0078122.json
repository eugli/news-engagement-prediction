Both face probation after their release, and were banished from Douglas County.\nAttorneys for Torres and Norton could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe sentences were a year longer than prosecutors had asked for, said Fortner, noting the crimes went beyond disagreements over the battle flag used by the pro-slavery South during the U.S. Civil War, which some defend as part of its heritage.\n\"This was a case where these people pulled out a shotgun and threatened to kill people at a party, including children,\" he said.\nThe incident played out during heightened debate over the symbolism of the flag, triggered by the racially-motivated shooting deaths of nine black churchgoers in South Carolina weeks earlier.\nProsecutors said witnesses attending the birthday party, featuring a bouncy castle and snow cone machine, testified that people in a convoy of trucks displaying the flag shouted racial slurs as they drove by, stopping next to the party.\nTorres was accused of pointing a shotgun at the predominately black party-goers and threatening to kill them, prosecutors said in a news release. Norton loaded the shotgun and gave it to him, they said.\nThe pair faced some of the most serious charges out of 15 members of the group \"Respect the Flag\" indicted over the incident, Fortner said. Two others facing similar charges pleaded guilty and were sentenced to lesser prison sentences.\n\n(Reporting by Letitia Stein; editing by Grant McCool)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:57:26.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
