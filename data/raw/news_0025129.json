HIGHLIGHT AND SHARE Highlight text to share via Facebook and Twitter ADVERTISEMENT \nAdding to the very long list of misogynistic comments made by Indian politicians, the first (and current) Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New Andhra Pradesh, compared the safety of a woman to a parked car. \nAccording to The News Minute , addressing the media at a press conference ahead of the National Women's Parliament in Amaravati, the Speaker, Kodela Sivaprasada Rao sparked outrage by saying: \n\"Let's say you buy a vehicle. When it's parked in the garage at home, accidents can be avoided, right? When it is taken to a bazaar or on the roads, accidents are likely to happen. When the car is speeding, it is more likely for accidents to take place. At a speed of 50 kmph accidents are less likely, but at a speed of 100 kmph accidents are more likely.\" \nRao then elaborately explained, saying that housewives during the \"old days\" were \"safe\" from all kinds of atrocities, except discrimination. He then concluded that because women had stepped out now for work, studies, etc, they were \"more prone\" to eve-teasing, harassment, rape, kidnap, etc. \n\"If they don't leave home, this won't happen,\" Rao said . \nIronically, Rao was speaking in context to an ongoing first-of-its-kind National Women's Parliament being held at Amaravati with its main themes being empowering women and strengthening democracy. Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama is also attending the event. \nBut irrespective of political parties, Indian politicians have always been infamous for their misogynistic comments, even in this day and age. \nLast month, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had taken a sizeist, sexist dig at Bahujan Samajwadi Party chief Mayawati, by likening her to an elephant, which also happens to be her party symbol. \nEarlier, BJP leader and RS member Vinay Katiyar had responded to the growing anticipation around Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's role in the Congress Party's campaign in UP, by saying that there were man other \"girls/women more beautiful than her\" who were star campaigners. \nAlso On HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T13:48:11.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
