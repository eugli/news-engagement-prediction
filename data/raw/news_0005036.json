Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA new mum has told of her young son's unexpected arrival after she suffered a massive stroke and gave birth in a coma. \nCiara Murray said she was shocked when she woke up in a hospital room and discovered she had a 10 day old baby . \nThe 33-year-old was 37 weeks pregnant when she suddenly and unexpectedly suffered the stroke, because of a blood clot on her brain. \nShe was rushed to hospital and doctors had to put her in a coma and perform emergency surgery to save her and her baby boy. Ciara was released from hospital when her son was six months old (Photo: PA Real Life) \nBefore the dramatic birth, Ciara, of Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, had experienced a normal pregnancy and had barely even suffered from morning sickness.

She didn’t make it to the bed and instead collapsed on the bedroom floor. \nWith her husband John, 36, out at work as a bricklayer, Ciara was unable to move and she lay there drifting in and out of consciousness for seven hours. \nCiara, who was working as a clerical officer in a school before she became ill, explained: “My husband was at work and I couldn't get up at all to get the phone. Every time I tried to pull myself up, I kept slipping down. \n“I couldn't feel the baby at all. I was far more worried about him than myself. I thought I had just fainted. \n“I was so frightened. I just had to close my eyes and hoped that the time would go quickly.” \nWhen John came home at 6.30pm, she was finally able to shout out for help. He rang for an ambulance and Ciara was blue-lighted to South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen. \nDoctors told her that she had suffered a stroke , but luckily, a scan of her baby showed that he was fine. James is thriving and didn’t suffer any impact from the stroke (Photo: PA Real Life) \nThey found that she had a clot on her brain and she was moved to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. The last thing she remembers before losing consciousness is her husband telling her she and the baby would be fine.

I woke up on November 10, which happened to be my husband’s birthday. The nurse told me the date and I said 'That's John's birthday'. \n“Then she told me that I'd had a baby. I couldn’t believe it. John brought him into me and it was just amazing. \n“I could hardly move but he just lay there on my chest. He was just a wee tiny bundle but he was perfect. \n“I just felt so lucky that he was ok as I was just so worried about him.” \nEvery day the dedicated dad made the three-hour, 160-mile round trip with James from their home in County Fermanagh to Belfast to make sure they got to spend time together as a family while Ciara underwent intense rehab.

Her rehab continues and she is still in a wheelchair, although she can walk round the house with a stick. \nLuckily, James, now 15 months, is thriving and didn’t suffer any impact from the stroke. \nHis mum said: \"He is completely fine. He's full of energy and he's ready to walk at the minute. We're both trying to get on our feet at the same time. \n“Doctors still don’t know what caused the stroke but I’m just so pleased that we’re both doing ok now.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:12:00.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
