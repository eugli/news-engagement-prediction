Evan Blass aka @evelaks just released this info via his Twitter handle, while he also revealed what will the phone be called in certain markets. It seems like Huawei plans to rebrand the Huawei P8 Lite (2017) to the Huawei Nova Lite in specific markets, though the source did not mention what markets that might be. In addition to the aforementioned caption, @evleaks also shared an image of the Huawei P8 Lite (2017) with the ‘Huawei Nova Lite’ branding, which seems to be the company’s official promo image. \n@evleaks did not elaborate on this leak, but chances are that nothing will change on the Huawei P8 Lite (2017) except it will become available under a different name. Huawei had introduced two ‘Nova’ smartphones last year, the Huawei Nova and Huawei Nova Plus. Well, it seems like a third ‘Nova’ smartphone is on the way, and if the previous two ‘Nova’ smartphones are any indication, the Huawei Nova Lite will become available in Europe, the Middle East and Asia at some point. That being said, the Huawei Nova Lite will almost certainly sport the same specs as the Huawei P8 Lite (2017), because these two devices will be identical, as already mentioned. This means that the Huawei Nova Lite will sport a 5.2-inch fullHD (1920 x 1080) display, along with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable native storage. This smartphone will be fueled by the Kirin 655 octa-core processor, along with the Mali-T830MP2 GPU for graphics. A 12-megapixel snapper will be placed on the back of the Huawei Nova Lite, and an 8-megapixel shooter will be available on the phone’s front side. Android 7.0 Nougat will come pre-installed on this smartphone, with Huawei’s Emotion UI (EMUI) 5.0 on top of it. This will be a dual SIM handset, and it will pack in a 3,000mAh non-removable battery. \nThe Huawei P8 Lite (2017) is made out of metal and glass, so the same applies for the Huawei Nova Lite as well. The fingerprint scanner is placed on the back of this smartphone, and all of its physical home keys are located on the right-hand side of this smartphone, we’re talking about the power / lock and volume rocker keys, of course.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:47:02.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
