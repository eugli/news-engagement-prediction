I told him that hopefully, the impact may be outside (the off-stump) and the ball had spun sharply enough to miss the leg stump. So he (Virat) took a call and was saved,\" Wriddhiman spoke about his role in that favourable review.\nThe glovesman said that Kohli saved a review for the team when he decided against going upstairs after a Taijul Islam armer trapped him leg before.\n\"During the second time, I was about to ask Virat to check but he was hundred percent convinced that it was out. Also it was umpire's call and even if there was a chance of the delivery barely touching the stumps, it would have been out. Virat didn't take a chance and saved a DRS for the team,\" he said.\nAgain when Bangladesh were batting, India got the wicket of opener Soumya Sarkar through a successful DRS after the on-field umpire had ruled not out.\nThis time Wriddhiman was unsure as to whether there was an inside edge but the skipper was fully convinced that the opener had inside edged it. Virat was vindicated when Sarkar trudged back to pavilion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:21:15.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
