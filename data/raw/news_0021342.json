Nattukotai Chettiar Temple trustee member Dr K.R. Palaniappan﻿﻿ inspects the silver chariot ﻿at the Chettiar-owned Kovil Veedu building in Penang Street﻿. — LIM BENG TATT/The Star \nThe question on everyone’s mind is which of the chariots will be better received by devotees, especially the Chinese community which breaks the most number of coconuts each year. \nBoard chairman Dr P. Ramasamy, who is Penang Deputy Chief Minister II, has been spewing vitriol against the Chettiars for not being transparent on donations received during Thaipusam. \nTo break the monopoly of the silver chariot, which has been operating for 162 years, Dr Ramasamy introduced the golden chariot with the backing of the state government, which has caused a split among devotees, the Tamil community in particular. \nThe religious procession has also turned political since the golden chariot is supported by the DAP, while the silver chariot has the support of the MIC. \nSupporters on both sides have turned to social media to appeal to devotees to offer prayers and offerings to their particular chariot. \nBoard executive director M. Ramachandran and Nattukotai Chettiar temple trustee Dr A. Narayanan said they would leave the choice to the devotees. \nBoth chariots and processions are for Lord Muruga, they said. \nRamachandran hoped that the whole event would be a great success while Dr Narayanan said devotees were most welcome to give their offerings to Lord Muruga on the silver chariot because this has been the practice all these years. \nDevotees could also witness the golden chariot’s journey through live streaming, by going to the Facebook page of the Penang Hindu Endowment Board or Dr Ramasamy’s from 4.30am today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:37:20.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
