A federal judge has temporarily blocked the executive order from being enforced, and the attorneys general of Washington and Minnesota, two states that are fighting the order in court, are preparing to hold the president accountable for his flagrantly Islamophobic rhetoric. \nBut the ban has had another, broader effect on American society. It has inspired thousands of people from different religions and races to stand in solidarity with their Muslim neighbors and with Muslim refugees and immigrants to the United States. Through protests and other acts of kindness, many have come forward to remind the country of the principles that make America great. \nThe courts are trying to figure out what the White House’s real intentions were with the ban. No matter the outcome, one thing is for sure ― it has inspired many, many moments of interfaith activism. \nBelow, The Huffington Post has gathered 29 photos of love and resistance that were taken after Trump’s executive order.
