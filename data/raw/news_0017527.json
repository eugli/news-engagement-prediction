We need to get rid of Muslims, Indians and Jews,\" telling them to \"get out of Texas and go back to where you came from\". \nThe family, described as Asian by family friend Tony Wadhawan, is too frightened to report it to police, much less discuss it publicly. They don't know if they were specifically targeted or if their house was selected at random. \n\"It is literally spewing words of hatred for everybody who isn't white Anglo Saxon,\" Wadhawan said, adding, \"That's basically what this letter says.\" \nIt is the second instance of hate incidents this week. \nSeveral houses in Sienna Plantation in Fortbend district had swastikas spray-painted on the fences. That was reported to the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office which is investigating the matter. \nRecently, recruitment posters were removed from several Texas universities, including Rice. They were put up by a white nationalist group. \nThe regional Anti-Defamation League office is seeing an uptick in reports of racially offensive leaflets and fliers in the first month of 2017. In January 2016, it had received about 10 of such reports. This year, the number has doubled. \n\"Perhaps it is more people reporting what they see,\" said ADL associate director Dena Marks. \"Or, there is something in the current rhetorical climate that makes people want to put this language out and we really need to fight against that,\" she added. \nAlso In Huffpost India 20 Bengali Vegetarian Dishes That Can Give Meat, Fish A Run For Their Money 20 Bengali Vegetarian Dishes That Can Give Meat, Fish A Run For Their Money 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:54:32.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
