Paul Pogba shows brotherly love after Florentin is forced off injured \nMourinho will stress the importance of taking one game at a time but even he must secretly have one eye on United’s EFL Cup final with Southampton later this month. \nRotation will be key in the coming weeks and, with that in mind, here’s how the Red Devils should line up. \nWhile Mourinho may be tempted to give Sergio Romero a rare outing, United cannot afford to take risks and David De Gea should retain his spot. \nThe Spaniard won the Europa League with previous club Atletico Madrid and he’s been in fine form – again – in recent weeks. Man Utd 3-0 St-Etienne player ratings: Ibrahimovic hat-trick puts tie to bed \nAhead of him, Mourinho’s intimated that he’ll stick with the same back four that played against Watford on Saturday but Antonio Valencia could do with a rest on the right hand side. \nThe full-back’s been one of United’s best performers this term but he should be wary of burnout and Timothy Fosu-Mensah has been criminally underused so far this term. Eric Bailly’s expected to start against St Etienne (Picture: Getty) \nIn midfield, Paul Pogba’s adapted better to a two-man midfield in recent weeks than he did at the start of the season. \nThe Frenchman started the season alongside just one central midfield partner but Mourinho switched to a 4-3-3 to curb some of the defensive responsibilities placed on Pogba’s shoulders. \nHowever, Mourinho praised Pogba for his defensive work on the weekend and he will certainly start against the Ligue 1 side, where his brother, Florentin plays. \nAnder Herrera’s form has dipped in recent weeks and Marouane Fellaini deserves to start at Old Trafford. The Belgian’s recovered from being booed against Tottenham in December and scored against Wigan in the last round of the FA Cup. Manchester United fixtures \nSt-Etienne – Europa (H) Thu 16 Feb Blackburn – FA Cup (A) – Sat 18 Feb St-Etienne – Europa (A) – Wed 22 Feb Southampton – EFL (N) – Sun 26 Feb Bournemouth (H) – Sat 4 Mar Southampton (A) – Sun 12 Mar Middlesbrough (A) – Sun 19 Mar West Brom (H) – Sat 1 Apr \nThe most likely area that Mourinho will rotate is in attack, where the Portuguese has an abundance of options. \nThe 2-0 win against Watford was seen as Anthony Martial’s revival moment this term and it would seen a discouraging message to the Frenchman if he’s dropped again on Thursday. \nThe former Monaco forward had Watford’s defence on toast throughout the game at the Theatre of Dreams and Mourinho will want a fast start on Thursday in the hope that United could finish the tie in the first leg. Martial was superb against Watford (Picture: Getty) \nHenrikh Mkhitaryan is another that’s playing too well to drop and the game is the perfect opportunity to play the Armenian in his favoured number 10 role behind Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \nOn the right wing, Juan Mata could retain his spot but it’s a good chance for Jesse Lingard or Marcus Rashford to get some game time – with the former more likely to start.
