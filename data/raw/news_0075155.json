Or you may recognise it by the fact that staying in shape seems to require ten times the effort it used to. But the good news is middle age offers you a profound opportunity to reprogramme your genes and your body. Even if you have fewer of the good genes and more of the bad genes (as I do), you can still lose weight, improve your skin and change how your DNA controls your body and mind (as I have done). There’s no need to test yourself to benefit from my advice — it can produce anti- ageing results without genetic testing. You already know key ways to make life easy for your body, whatever your genetic mix: sleep a minimum six hours a night; exercise for 20 to 30 minutes four days a week; take time out for stress- busting and relaxation; keep your brain active and eat healthily. EASY TRICKS TO AGE-PROOF YOUR EYES Most specialists believe presbyopia (‘old eyes’) — where the lens stiffens with age and the muscles slacken — to be unavoidable, but I disagree. Have regular check-ups, eat lots of vegetables, fruit and fish, wear sunglasses and do these exercises daily to prevent or delay presbyopia: PALMING Relax eyes by rubbing your hands together vigorously, then place your warm hands over your eyes to soothe the muscles. Apply gentle pressure for about a minute. FOCUS CONTROL Hold a pencil 18 in to 20 in from your face. Focus on the pencil point as you slowly pull it to the bridge of your nose. Repeat three times. Holding the pencil in front of you, look out of a window to the horizon. Trace the horizon for five seconds or more, then return your focus to the pencil. Repeat three times. It helps eye muscles focus over near and far distances, to keep your lens young. BOXING To help relax eye muscles, imagine a box. Look up to the right corner, inhale and exhale, then look up to the left corner, breathe. Repeat for all four corners. But, with my help, if you target certain gene variants, you might just be able to give yourself a head start and super-boost your very own rejuvenation process. Whether you are 45 or 65, my advice will help you prevent signs of ageing and feel healthier and stronger than ever. TURN OFF GENES There’s nothing more ageing than a weight problem — yet it’s more difficult to lose excess pounds as you get older. But you can minimise how genetics affect behaviour with food and, consequently, your weight by taking a good guess at the eating genes you may have inherited. If you tend to overeat: you may have a gene called ANKK1/DRD2, which can lead to overeating and addictive behaviours. Outwit this by searching for pleasure in non-food items, such as a massage, hot bath, meditation or yoga, and drinking green tea (which raises dopamine levels in the brain). Keep a food journal to stay on track and refuse to let the inner addict run the show. If your downfall is snacking: you may have a gene variant that leads to over-snacking — once you start, it’s hard to stop. Stick to three meals a day and ban snacks in your home. If you never feel full: you could have the ‘Fatso’ gene (‘fat mass and obesity associated’ or FTO), which makes it hard for you to know when to stop eating. This gene is strongly associated with a higher risk for obesity and diabetes. When you have the variant, it gives you poor control of the hormone leptin, which should tell you when you’re full. It can mean you feel hungry much of the time. You can turn off this gene with exercise and a low carbohydrate, high fibre diet. Try weighing food and planning meals in advance. It removes the need to bargain with yourself or waste time wondering whether or not you’re really hungry. If you have a sweet tooth: you could have a gene that gives you an increased likelihood of eating more sweets and a propensity for excess weight to cling to your waist. Boosting your intake of fruit can help. If you suspect meat causes you to gain weight: it might be due to a gene variant called PPARy (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma). It controls how the body responds to certain types of fat and makes you more likely to lose weight if you eat more fish than meat. One study showed women who have this gene lose weight when they consume more than 50 per cent of fat from the omega-3s and omega-6s found in fish, shellfish and nuts. If you suspect this affects you, an omega-3 supplement might help. If you are always hungry: you might have a variant of the ‘clock gene’, which controls your body clock, or circadian rhythm. If you have a bad variant you will have high levels of the hormone ghrelin, which makes you hungry, and this can leave you highly resistant to weight loss. But by establishing firm bedtime and waking times (and sticking with them) you can protect your circadian rhythm and help regulate these hormones. You need eight hours of sleep a night to lose weight if you have the bad variant of this gene. Unlike a fine Bordeaux, your body does not get better with age. Indeed, it is very common to find that when you hit middle age you just can’t cope with a few drinks like you once did SAUNAS RESET DNA Regular sessions in a sauna give the body a shock of heat, which appears to help reset its fine-tuning mechanisms, including DNA. A sauna activates the longevity gene FOXO3, which turns on genes for stress resilience, production of disease-fighting antioxidants, maintenance of proteins (to keep muscles strong), DNA repair (prevents mutations) and tumour killing. So using a sauna is handy as we get older because it seems to boost exactly the genes that become less effective with age. In addition to turning on other important genes, FOXO3 helps you make something called ‘heat-shock proteins’. These work to ensure proteins in your body are folded like a fitted sheet, not bunched up and wrinkled. Poorly folded proteins clump together and cause damage in the form of furred-up arteries, heart failure and diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Heat-shock proteins also work to counteract ‘oxidative stress’ — the natural rusting process that happens to the body over time. Studies show when you make more FOXO3 (because you are genetically predisposed to do so or because you enjoy a regular session in the sauna), you triple your chance of living to 100. Even if you have a sauna only once every couple of months your heart will benefit. DRINK RED WINE Unlike a fine Bordeaux, your body does not get better with age. Indeed, it is very common to find that when you hit middle age you just can’t cope with a few drinks like you once did. I love a glass of wine, but more than two glasses a week keeps me awake, makes me retain water weight and feel sluggish. Drink causes poor sleep, headaches, low energy, night sweats, hot flushes and weight gain. Though age plays a part, if your ability to enjoy a few drinks has taken a dive in recent years, you may have a faulty methylation gene (called MTHFR). It determines how chemicals are tagged in the body, or methylated, and how you detox alcohol in your system (alcohol blocks methylation). You might find alcohol has no place in your vibrant, healthy future, but there are two ways to outfox alcohol-metabolising genes: eating more leafy green vegetables and being circumspect about the amount — and type — of alcohol you drink. The body needs plenty of vitamin B9 to detoxify alcohol and some of us don’t have great genes for producing or metabolising B9. But the more dark, leafy greens (cabbage, spinach, kale) and other greens (lettuce, asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower) you eat, the more you boost B9 naturally and so help the body cope with alcohol. It’s a good idea to start keeping a booze diary and track your response to nights on and nights off, including which tipples don’t suit you genetically. I suggest sticking to red wine, which studies have shown can be good for you. That’s because the grapes contain a plant compound called resveratrol, which has anti-ageing benefits (including prevention of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer). Interestingly, its effects are most impressive in people who are obese (BMI over 30). But moderation is key — one or two glasses a week to give genes the best chance. Three or more glasses is linked to a slightly raised risk of breast and other cancers. Organic wine minimises exposure to chemicals, and opt for a drink with the highest concentration of resveratrol. Pinot noir has higher resveratrol levels than other varieties across the world, except the Trentino region in Italy, where the cabernet sauvignon levels were higher still. Wines with the most resveratrol are harvested from cooler regions. Choose organic and pick pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon, Italian sangiovese, Australian shiraz or French burgundy. And finally, think yourself young. People with an optimistic view of themselves and how they are ageing live an impressive eight years longer.
