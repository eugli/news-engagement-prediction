Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nHowever, this proposed change to the wording of the act is considered one of the most ambitious options for change in the report and it is not certain that it would be taken up by Mr Turnbull - though the Prime Minister is certain to face pressure from the Right of his party to adopt this big change. \nOther, less controversial options that the report will flag include changes to the functioning of the Australian Human Rights Commission, which would allow it to knock back so-called vexatious complaints earlier in the process. Advertisement \nA third option for reform presented would involved broadening section 18D - which offers protections for discussions, debate and publication of comments \"if the comment is an expression of a genuine belief held by the person making the comment\". \nThe Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which has prepared the report after hearings around Australia late last year, will leave it up to the Turnbull government to decide which, if any, of the range of reform options proposed are adopted. \nAfter initially resisting a push led by Liberal party senators to change section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, Mr Turnbull relented late last and the inquiry was called. \nChanging the act is a totemic issue for some in the Coalition, who believe the laws as currently constituted, represent a curb on freedom of speech. Former prime minister Tony Abbott promised to change the act when opposition leader, but dumped the changes amid a massive community backlash in 2014. \nHowever, there are also Liberals who believe that changing the law could send the wrong signal to ethnic and community groups who support the laws as currently written. \nBy proposing reform options in the report, the committee is effectively leaving it up to government and giving Mr Turnbull the room to make the call about whether to proceed with the changes.
