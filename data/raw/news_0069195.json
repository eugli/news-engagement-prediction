Bloom Pain-free A-Gon eagerly anticipating Classic Adrian Gonzalez expects to play for Team Mexico once he is cleared by Dodgers physicians. (AP) By Barry M. Bloom / MLB.com | @boomskie | + 0 COMMENTS \nGLENDALE, Ariz. -- Adrian Gonzalez told MLB.com that his right elbow is now free of pain early Thursday morning before the team worked out on the backfields of Camelback Ranch. \nThat assessment was corroborated shortly thereafter by Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. \nNot only is that good news for the Dodgers, it's great news for Team Mexico, which hosts Pool D in the first round of the upcoming World Baseball Classic next month in Guadalajara, Mexico. \nA-Gon said he intends to play if cleared by Dodgers physicians when Mexico opens against Italy on March 9 at the brand-new Estadio Charros de Jalisco. Puerto Rico and Venezuela are the other two teams in the bracket. And that medical clearance seems to be a formality at this point. \n\"I'm planning to play,\" said the lefty-swinging first baseman, whose older brother, Edgar, is managing the team. \"I'm hoping for it. We've taken all the right precautions. I've got to get cleared by the doctors, so we'll see.\" \nStanding by his locker in the Dodgers' clubhouse, Gonzalez had an electronic stimulation unit attached by a patch to the inside of the elbow. His program right now includes strengthening legs and core, cardio conditioning and treatment. \nâ€¢ Spring Training: Information | Tickets | Schedule | Gear \nAsked about any lingering pain from the tendinitis that has plagued him since this past offseason, Gonzalez said: \"I'm fine. It feels great.\" \nAside from the aerobic and lower body work, Gonzalez has yet to the swing the bat this spring. But there's no rush, Roberts said, even with Team Mexico slated to gather at the Padres' camp in nearby Peoria, Ariz., on March 6. Mexico plays exhibition games against the Padres on March 7 and the D-backs on March 8 before heading to Guadalajara. Team Mexico ready for WBC 2017 Gonzalez, Romo to lead Mexico in WBC 2017 Adrian Gonzalez and Sergio Romo talk about Team Mexico's mindset in the 2017 World Baseball Classic under their manager, Edgar Gonzalez \nRoberts isn't worried about the 34-year-old Gonzalez, who has missed 20 games total the last four seasons and hasn't played fewer than 156 games in any of the last 11 seasons. He has a lifetime slash line of .290/.362/.492, with 308 homers, 1,324 RBIs and a .854 OPS playing for the Padres, Red Sox and Dodgers. \n\"He's moving around the lower half and doing all that, but the swinging the bat, the catching the baseball, we're still holding him back from that,\" Roberts said. \"As I understand it, he's pain-free. We're just trying to take it a little slow for Adrian. \n\"As far as the Classic, that's kind of his target, and so a few days before that, I'm sure we'll get him swinging the bat, making sure he's a full go from our guys. But I know he's excited about it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:06:39.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
