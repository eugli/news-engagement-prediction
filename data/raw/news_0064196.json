The track hits full speed straight out the gate, with a two-ton syncopated guitar riff and bursts of harmonized backing vocals, before easing into lush, reverberated melody. While not a complete return-to-form, it's a sly nod to seasoned listeners that Ride have decided to pick up where they left off: at the junction of ’60s psych, ’80s indie, and ’90s power-pop. Partly, this peek into the past comes from their reunion with the engineer Alan Moulder, who helped give the band’s first two records their overpowering shimmer, but they’ve also modernized the formula with DJ Erol Alkan , whose production lends an airy, big-room touch to the track. \nThe message behind “Charm Assault” is one that's decidedly 2017: “[It’s] a pretty straightforward expression of frustration and disgust at the people who currently run our country,” according to frontman Andy Bell.The lyrics are indeed blunt: “Your charm assault/Has scarred the world/It looks so ugly/As your lies begin to unfurl.” Many bands from Ride’s heyday have reunited in recent years, but few have done so with such a renewed edge of energy, self-awareness, and mettle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:01:08.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
