He doesn't see what it has to do with the show.\" \nThe final straw was when Josh reportedly mocked Pete and asked him if he thought he was being a 'hypocrite' for breaking his preferred diet for the show. \nThe celebrity judge said he would leave if the \"arrogant and antagonistic\" 25-year-old wasn't put in his place, according to Woman's Day . \n\"He told producers he wanted them to call Josh in and read him the riot act,\" a source allegedly said. \"It was stop bullying Pete or else he'd be out.\" \nThe paleo diet typically includes vegetables, fruits, nuts, roots, meat and organ meats.
