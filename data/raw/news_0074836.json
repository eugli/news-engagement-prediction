Alec Moir, 78, and his wife, Judith, 76, sold it to HS2 in January 2016, because initial plans mean the track would go through part of their land. The property has been standing empty ever since. 'OUR PLACE HAS BEEN LEFT TO ROT' Hillcrest, a four-bedroom 1920s property with nearly 17 acres and a tennis court, was sold to HS2 for £1.7 million in January 2016 by retired engineer Alec Moir and his wife Judith. Initial plans put the rail route through the couple’s land. But the property has stood empty since the sale. Mr Moir, who lived there for 37 years, said: ‘We got a fair value for the 15 acres of land.’ But he said HS2 ‘undervalued’ the house and 1.7 acres around it, adding: ‘The house and garden have been left to rot.’ Also in Great Missenden, Fosca Levison lived with her husband Nicholas, 81, for 43 years at Sheepcotts – a charming five-bedroom house with six reception rooms, three bathrooms and a tennis court. They sold it to HS2 in June 2015 for £2.75 million. In Leicestershire, the HS2 route was originally planned to go west of the village of Measham, 20 miles north of Leicester. But that would have wrecked an industrial park which was one of the main employers in the area, so the route was changed last year to go east of Measham. By then, HS2 had spent £2.9 million on three properties near the old route. One was The Old Rectory, owned by Tory MP Mr Bridgen. The eight-bedroom Georgian property, set in 18 acres, has a swimming pool and tennis court. Mr Bridgen, the MP for North-West Leicestershire, had to sell his property at the time as part of a divorce settlement with his wife, Jacqueline. But he said he could not find a buyer as news spread that HS2 was building its track through the area, so he was obliged to sell it to the company. The MP eventually sold to HS2 for £1.9 million in June last year. He said the deal meant he made a substantial loss as he bought the property in 2011 for £2.1 million, then paid out a further £450,000 in stamp duty, fixtures and fittings and other costs. Nearby is Heath Lodge, a bungalow set in eight acres which was owned by Eric Skelding, a Second World War veteran who turns 100 next month. In 2014, Mr Skelding found himself having to sell after being admitted to a nursing home following a fall. But with the proposed route at the time going through his property, there was no chance of finding a buyer on the open market. TORY MP: 'MY HOUSE WAS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE' Tory MP Andrew Bridgen bought The Old Rectory in Leicestershire for £2.1 million in 2011 Tory MP Andrew Bridgen bought The Old Rectory in Leicestershire for £2.1 million in 2011 and spent a further £450,000 on it. But the politician needed to sell the eight-bedroom Georgian pile as part of a divorce settlement with his ex-wife Jacqueline (pictured with him). He could not find a buyer because of the proposed rail route and sold to HS2 in June 2016 for £1.9 million. Mr Bridgen said: ‘I would have got more in the open market. That property was the love of my life. 'I don’t think I can afford another one like it.’ Retired Nicholas Levison and his wife Fosca owned Sheepcotts, in Great Missenden for 43 years. The couple sold the five-bedroom home to HS2 for £2.75 million in June 2015. Mrs Levison said: ‘As you might expect, I was absolutely distraught to leave because it is such a beautiful part of the country and we had made it our home. ‘Then to find out that they’re not even building the HS2 route where our home was is outrageous.’ The widower finally sold to HS2 for £640,000, which his family believe was below market value. Martin Roberts, presenter of BBC series Homes Under The Hammer, said: ‘Any threat of development or negative change will not only nuke house prices, but stifle demand almost completely. 200-ACRE-FARM AND A £500K LOSS Mantles Farm in Amersham comprises a five-bedroom farmhouse, swimming pool, and a separate three-bedroom cottage, all set in 202 acres. The elderly widow who owned it put it on the market in 2013 for £4.75 million. It was finally sold to HS2 for £4.2 million in April 2015 – and is now being rented out. ‘You enter fire-sale territory, where buyers make silly money offers and sellers are sometimes forced to accept them.’ He added: ‘Some of these houses are in real trophy territory, so it wouldn’t be unrealistic to see immediate rises in the 30 to 50 per cent range, then steady growth of seven to ten per cent a year. ‘Owners who were forced to sell have every right to be upset. Not only have they suffered the emotional upheaval of a move and loss of, possibly, a family home, but they have lost out considerably from a financial point of view.’ An estate agent with more than 20 years’ experience in the Chilterns area estimated that the actual value of the properties HS2 bought were now tens of thousands of pounds more than the amounts paid by the rail firm thanks to the route change. The HS2 route has also been changed in South Yorkshire. Initially, the line would have gone through Sheffield’s Meadowhall area, but due to local opposition it will now go through the town of Mexborough. HS2 has confirmed that so far no properties have been needlessly bought in the South Yorkshire area. HS2 said: ‘Six years ago we set up the first of a series of compensation schemes to help give homeowners the chance to sell their properties at their full, unblighted market value. ‘In order to ensure value for the taxpayer, we currently rent out 85 per cent of lettable properties and plan to sell all those we don’t need for construction.’ HS2’s first phase should be completed in 2026 and stage two is scheduled to finish by 2033.
