Salmon producers report strong growth \nThe move by Tassal to join the legal action comes as Tasmanian salmon producers report increased profits thanks to improved weather conditions and a strong salmon price. \nHuon posted a net profit after tax of $31.5 million for the first half of this financial year compared to a loss of $1.3 million at the same time last year. \nIn a letter to investors, the company said more favourable weather patterns, higher prices and better feed performance led to the improvement. \n\"It is particularly gratifying after the challenges experienced in financial year 2016 to report such a strong result for the first half of 2017,\" managing director Peter Bender said. \n\"We are now firmly back on track and able to focus our energies on continuing to build a resilient and sustainable business.\" \nHuon said its sales to the Australian retail market had doubled. \nThe company's harvest tonnage was down 24 per cent on last year but said that was because of a decision to bring forward harvest in the first half of 2016 in anticipation of forecast El Nino conditions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:41:33.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
