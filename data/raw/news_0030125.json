The pair could be seen dancing before performing a difficult looking handshake. \nThe video drew negative criticism from former teammate Rio Ferdinand who believed the pair should be distancing themselves from any such social media activity while United remain outside the top four. \nBut it appears the Frenchman has decided to ignore the advice given by the Man United legend and continue to post funny videos anyway. \nIn the video, Pogba and his mum perform a funny looking shimmy before locking hands and raising them to ceiling. \nOn the video, the 23-year-old commented, 'That's my best friend'. While he captioned \"Best handshake ever\" with the post.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:14:19.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
