And India said they are multilateral only because of China's intransigence. \n\nRepresentatives of the two countries met yesterday in Beijing. China has continued to block UN sanctions on Pakistani terrorist Masood Azhar. \n\n\"India always wants to portray Pakistan as a 'supporter of terrorism ' in the international community, which makes it easier for the country to link counter-terrorism issue to Sino-Pakistani relationship and blame China's support to Pakistan for some issues,\" Global Times cited Lin Minwang, a professor at the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University as saying. \n\nIndia, Lin said, \"does not understand the significance of Sino-Pakistani friendship.\" \n\nChina has demanded \"solid evidence\" against Azhar, saying the \"burden of proof \" is on India. It also claims there's no consensus in UN's 1267 committee on sanctioning the terrorist. Not so, India said. \n\nAzhar's actions are well documented, Jaishankar said. And this time around, \"it's not India but other countries (that moved the plea for sanctions). So, there's a body of world opinion,\" he added. \n\nHe was referring to the US, France and the UK who also want Azhar sanctioned. As for China blocking India getting membership to the NSG, it's again claiming that the move is being blocked by other countries. \n\n\"India blames China for blocking it from the NSG, but aside from China, many NSG members including Brazil, Austria, New Zealand, Ireland and Turkey are also opposed to India's bid citing the fact that India has not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),\" wrote Global Times. \n\nGlobal Times said trade is another \"problem\" between the two countries. \"India's trade deficit with China is increasing since many of China's products meet the needs of the Indian market, such as small household appliances,\" Lin told the state-run media outlet. \n\nYesterday's meeting between foreign secretary S Jaishankar and China's executive vice-minister for foreign affairs Zhang Yesui was the first strategic dialogue between the two countries since Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:57:03.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
