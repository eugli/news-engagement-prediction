The perception of a divide with Silicon Valley was also fostered by Mr. Spiegel’s rejection of a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook in 2013. Some who met Mr. Spiegel during Snapchat’s early days at Stanford describe him as akin to the villain of a 1980s teen movie. He often came across as having a healthy ego, an impression Mr. Spiegel sometimes stoked. \nAdvertisement   When Mr. Spiegel met Institutional Venture Partners to discuss possible fund-raising, for example, he told IVP’s partner, Dennis Phelps, that he was unwilling to accept the firm’s standard investment terms. “If you want standard terms, invest in a standard company,” Mr. Phelps recalled Mr. Spiegel telling him. IVP went on to invest in Snap’s third financing round in 2013 . Photo Mr. Spiegel and his girlfriend, the model Miranda Kerr, attending a dinner at the White House in May.

He met his fiancée, the model Miranda Kerr , at a Louis Vuitton dinner. And he once toyed with the idea of owning a record label with ties to Snapchat, according to a 2015 email between Sony executives that was released by hackers. “He’s different from most tech people because he knows what’s cool and what’s next,” said Ryan Wilson, an artist in Los Angeles who worked with Mr. Spiegel on a piece of art for one of Snapchat’s offices. “He doesn’t like things because a dealer says he should. He just likes what he likes, whether it’s made by a high school friend or a famous artist.” Mr. Spiegel has also involved himself in some political conversations. In 2015, he met with China’s president, Xi Jinping, as a member of the 21st Century Council at the Berggruen Institute. Its founder, Nicolas Berggruen, said he impressed a group that includes Mohamed El-Erian, the economist, and former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France with his “thoughtful and mature approach to people.” Last fall, Mr. Spiegel also attended a private dinner with John O. Brennan, then the director of the C.I.A. According to multiple attendees, Mr. Spiegel listened more than he spoke and had the ear of Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles. Mr. Spiegel’s unconventional streak may be most evident in how he has steered Snap. He has long said that a public offering was what was best for the company and its investors, even as other tech start-ups chose to stay private as long as possible. Since Snapchat’s debut, the app and the company have also undergone dozens of changes that were criticized for being too different from other consumer internet companies. Mr. Spiegel rejected the idea of a newsfeed in Snapchat’s app, for example, because he said people prefer stories chronologically. In Facebook’s News Feed, posts are reverse chronological, meaning the newest posts are at the top. \nAdvertisement   Unlike other social networks, Snapchat also does not use algorithms to push people to see certain content. Snapchat users swipe their screens to navigate and view video vertically, rather than tap on menus or turn their phones to watch videos horizontally. “From what I can figure out, he thinks differently about the way to monetize and develop a social network,” Mr. Schmidt said of Mr. Spiegel. Investors who buy into Snap’s initial public offering will soon be getting a piece of that approach. Allowing “ourselves to be pulled in another direction” is what makes us human, Mr. Spiegel said in a commencement speech at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business in 2015. Quoting John F. Kennedy, he added, “Conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.” \nDoris Burke contributed research from New York.
