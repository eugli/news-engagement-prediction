(AAP: Joel Carrett) \nAusgrid received more than 400 reports of dangerous hazards on the network including fallen wires and trees damaging power lines. Multiple lightning strikes and falling trees caused serious damage to electrical infrastructure. \n\"Crews will be working as quickly as they can but it is likely that some small pockets of areas and some individual customers will be without power well into the weekend, possibly into Sunday,\" Ms Wheeler said. \n\"Crews have to go to those sites and make sure that area is safe for the public to be around, there is obviously live electrical equipment that we need to make safe if wires are on the ground. \n\"So once crews have made the area safe, they'll work to get the power on as quickly as they can.\" \nSydney's west was one of the hardest hit, and Canada Bay SES Unit Deputy Controller Bill Hoyles said it was the worst storm he had seen in 17 years on the job. \n\"We've had some really big trees come down across backyards down on roofs, a lot of roof damage,\" he said. \n\"With such a large number of jobs it may take time to get to some of those jobs, but we will get round to you as quickly as we possibly can.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:11:52.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
