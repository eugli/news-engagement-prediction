The algorithms then predict things like your political affiliation or eating and shopping habits based on comments and messages you've typed. \nThis may all sound a bit frightening, but rest assured, no one else will see this data (only the robots). Data Selfie keeps all of the information it collects locally on your own computer. \nThe code for this transparency tool is available on Github if you want to play around with stocking yourself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:42:50.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
