Em. Gee. \nLet’s take these “spoilers” with a grain of salt, however. The account’s claims haven’t been confirmed by anyone on the show, and the identity behind @PLLInsider is a mystery (which is most appropriate for the show, really). \nPlus, back before Charlotte was revealed to be “A” and “Charles,” someone who claimed to be an “insider” on Reddit had spoilers that Wren Kingston was “A.” So these things have been wrong before. \nOK, are you ready to learn who Uber A is? (Maybe?) \nThe PLLInsider Twitter account claims that Uber A is Lauren DiLaurentis . \nWhat? Who? When? \nLauren DiLaurentis is the long-rumored but never confirmed twin of Alison , the account says. \nThere is some merit here: In the original books, Alison did have a secret twin. And, of course, twins have been a major theme of the show. \nHere’s the backstory: Remember the sibling Charlotte tried to drown in the bathtub, which landed her to Radley? The account claims that was Lauren. Lauren DiLaurentis is the ultimate manipulator and the one true puppeteer from the very start of the PLL saga. #PLLEndgame PLL INSIDER (@PLLINSlDER) January 26, 2017 LAUREN DILAURENTIS WAS THE ONE WHO CHARLOTTE TRIED TO DROWN IN THE BATHTUB BY ACCIDENT. THIS LEFT LAUREN BURNED AND BLIND. PLL INSIDER (@PLLINSlDER) January 26, 2017 \nAnd when you think of blind and Rosewood, who do you think of? Jenna Marshall . \nThe claims continue that Lauren met Jenna at the school for the blind, where Noel Kahn literally lost his head in the summer finale, and recruited Jenna to her side. Jenna and Lauren DiLaurentis met in the school for the blind. They worked together to get rid of Toby's mother, among other times. PLL INSIDER (@PLLINSlDER) January 26, 2017 \nYou see, Lauren was manipulating Charlotte because of Charlotte’s guilt over hurting her. She used her to torture Alison all these years. \nBut Jenna isn’t the only familiar face joined up with Alison’s twin. \nLucas is A-moji and Lauren’s partner. LAUREN DILAURENTIS AND LUCAS GOTTESMAN ARE \"AD\". PLL INSIDER (@PLLINSlDER) January 26, 2017 LUCAS PLAYED THE GAME WITH HER BECAUSE HE WAS MADLY IN LOVE WITH CHARLOTTE. THEY HOOKED UP AFTER CHARLOTTE RETURNED FROM PARIS. PLL INSIDER (@PLLINSlDER) January 26, 2017 \nLucas became A-moji to track down the identity of Charlotte’s killer. \nUber A’s identity isn’t only potential spoiler the Twitter account dropped. Prep the tears because it seems the OG “A” isn’t going to make it. \nMona will die in a fire set by “A.D.” trying to save the girls. It’s worth noting there is a pivotal fire in the books. \nAnd she isn’t the only casualty of the season. \nPastor Ted will also die because (what?!) the account claims he is Charlotte’s biological father.
