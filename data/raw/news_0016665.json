Wearing fleece jackets and baseball caps, they slash and wade their way through the largest subtropical wilderness in the world to hunt down Burmese pythons. \nThe non-native snakes - which escaped into the wild in Florida or were released as pets - pose the biggest threat to the small mammal population of the national park. They also eat birds, alligators and deer. In 2005, a Burmese python tried to swallow an alligator and exploded in the park, leaving both the predators dead. \nEver since the pythons were spotted in the wild more than two decades ago, authorities have tried everything to catch the elusive snakes in the marshes, but with limited success. \nThey have used pythons (called Judas snakes) to find other pythons during the mating season, asked people to turn in their pet snakes, poisoned prey, and even encouraged people to hunt them for a cash prize . \nLast year, some 1,000 hunters participated in a competitive month-long Burmese python hunt to rid the wetland of the invasive species, and caught 106 snakes. \nBy comparison, in the past four weeks, the two 50-something tribesmen from India have caught 27 pythons, including a 16ft-long (5m) female in an abandoned missile base in Key Largo. Pythons that caught are later put down. Burmese pythons Image copyright Getty Images Burmese pythons (Python bivittatus) have several common names, including Asiatic rock python, black-tailed python and Indian rock python They are native to India, lower China, the Malay Peninsula and some islands of South and Southeast Asia The snakes - which usually reach up to 3m (about 12 feet) in length, but can be more than 5m long - have secured a foothold in the southeast US, after pet snakes were released, or escaped, into the wild They are now considered a threat to biodiversity in the Florida Everglades \n\"Masi and Vadivel are doing an incredible job. They excel at determining if pythons are present at a site, locating them if they are, and then catching them when located,\" Frank Mazzotti, a biologist at the University of Florida who heads a team of researchers investigating pythons, told me. \n\"They can see pythons even when they are covered by grass. All they need is a glint of snake and they pounce. The rest of us are usually wondering where the snake is. Next thing we see they are holding it.\" \nThe Miami Herald marvelled at the snake-hunting skills of the Irulas, whom herpetologist Rom Whitaker describes as the \"best snake catchers\" in the world. The newspaper reported that the Irulas appeared to have \"mysterious\" tracking techniques. \n\"They move slowly and rather than focus on roads and levees where snakes have typically been found basking, they head straight for thick brush. The Irulas believe the boulders and high grasses that line the levees are more lucrative hunting grounds. \n\"And when the going gets slow, everyone must stop to squat for a quick song of prayer - usually an ancient invocation mixed with an ad lib about pythons or the weather - accompanied by a beedi cigarette.\" Image copyright Ed Metzger, University of Florida Image caption Their biggest catch as been a 16ft-long female python in an abandoned missile base \nWriter and filmmaker Janaki Lenin, who is accompanying the tribesmen, has provided a gripping account of the female python they recovered in Key Largo. The two men cut the roots that blocked the entrance to the bunker, pried open a door, went inside, poked the snake, broke through a concrete shaft and hauled out the 75kg (165lb) reptile. \nAnother time, a eight-foot-long python, according to Ms Lenin, \"struggled and emptied its bowels\" on Masi, who held the tail. \"After the Irula bagged the python, the grinning but impressed Americans held their noses with their fingers, miming how stinky the snake faeces were,\" she recounted. \nMasi said he was not bothered. \"Only if you are covered in it, can you catch snakes.\" \nFor the past month, the two men, who have travelled around the world to catch snakes, have been living in the home of a local reptile enthusiast. Their two months of work is funded by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission which has paid up nearly $70,000 (Â£56,000) to host them along with two translators. \nAfter an oatmeal breakfast, they are driven to work. Sometimes they go out after dark. In the early days, they survived on Trinidadian Indian food, but since then they have tried hotdogs and burgers and watched an NFL game. \n\"All that they say so far is that they like being in America and want to catch lots of pythons,\" Ms Lenin told me.
