I'm not impressed at all,\" Mayweather Sr said previously . \nHe didn't stop there either, as the 63-year-old made it known that if his son decides he doesn't want the fight, that he's more than happy to step in. \n\"If my son decides he don't want to do it, I'll take it over, I'll do it.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem as though it's McGregor who doesn't want to do the fight but instead is Mayweather who's pushed back on it. \nTime will tell, but fans can keep their fingers crossed that the fight will wind up happening when all is said and done.
