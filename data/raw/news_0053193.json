Team USA had other ideas though. \nWith their unheralded 4-3 upset of the Soviet Union, Team USA earned the right to play the Finland squad for the gold medal - a game in which they trailed 2-1 entering the third period only to come back and win 4-2 and claim Olympic gold medals. \nWith such an amazing moment in both American and sports history, it's only fitting that on the 37 year anniversary of such an iconic moment that we relive the moment and watch the final minute of Team USA's stunning victory over the Soviet Union. \nDo you believe in miracles? YES! 37 years ago, Team USA made History in the Olympics. \"Do you believe in Miracles?\" ... #MiracleOnIce pic.twitter.com/K1SCsbNS07 — Bar South N Celly™ (@BarSouthNCelly) February 22, 2017 There is too much fun and frivolity that goes on at KFAN on a daily basis that is overflows from the Show Pages and needs a place to live!
