CHENNAI: Some AIADMK legislators, who have been staying in two resorts near Mahabalipuram since Wednesday night after attending a meeting convened by party general secretary V K Sasikala in Chennai, met journalists on Friday and asserted that they had not been kidnapped and confined in a single place by force. Kattumannarkoil MLA N Murugumaran, Krishnarayapuram MLA M Geetha, Gudiyattam MLA C Jayanthi Padmanabhan and five other legislators, who have been staying in Golden Bay Beach Resort, met the media almost 2km away from the place of their stay and claimed that they had not been kidnapped. The MLAs , who came in batches, said had voluntarily come forward to stay in a single place to extend their solidarity to Sasikala who has staked claim to form the government in Tamil Nadu. Murugamaran said the party general council had pleaded late chief minster J Jayalithaa's long-term friend Sasikala to fill the vacuum created by the demise of their beloved leader by assuming charge as the general secretary of the party. \"On February 5, the party MLAs anonymously elected Chinnamma as the AIADMK legislature party leader to pave way for her to become the chief minister. We felt the party's general secretary must be the chief minister,\" he said. The MLAs said they had switched off their mobile phones as they had been receiving calls continuously from unknown people. Geetha said, \"Initially callers were polite but as time passed by they started abusing. We have no option other than to switch off our mobile phones,\" Vehicles carrying AIADMK flag coming out of a resort near Mahabalipuram where MLAs are staying The MLAs said people whom they did not know had filed habeas corpus petitions in the Madras high court stating they were missing. \"It is plot hatched out by rival camp,\" Jayanthi said. Around 120 MLAs have been camping at two resorts near Mahabalipuram since Wednesday night. They were staying in the resorts after caretaker chief minister O Panneerselvam revolted against Sasikala who was elected as legislature party leader on Sunday. There were reports that MLAs were not allowed to use mobile phones and television sets in their rooms were disconnected. There were also reports that some MLAs on Thursday registered their dissent for disconnecting television sets and refused to have lunch. On Thursday, Sasikala's supporters, who had gathered near the resort, prevented journalists from reaching the hotel. Men stopped journalists around 2km away from the hotel. On Thursday evening, Panneerselvam and Sasikala met acting Tamil Nadu Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao. Panneerselvam sought time to form a government and complained to the Governor 'detention' of MLAs by Sasikala camp. Sasikala, who met the Governor two hours later, staked claim to form the government. The Governor has sent a report to the Centre after the meetings.
