But because it's so easy to simply hire a hand double or use computer effects to embellish one's piano-playing abilities in this day and age, we're glad to finally have proof that Ryan Gosling really is a master of the 88 keys. \nVariety just released a behind-the-scenes video featuring a few different on-set moments. In each clip, the camera zooms in on Ryan rocking the piano, without the fancy lights and supporting music. It's also pretty fun to see the rehearsal clips, in which Ryan, John Legend, and other cast members are on set in their casual street clothes. \nSpeaking at a press event, La La Land director Damien Chazelle explained that every time we see Gosling's hands on screen, they really are his hands. \"In fact, there's not a single close-up shot of [the character] Sebastian's hands in the entire movie that's a piano double. It's all Ryan,\" Chazelle said . Variety adds that Chazelle planned to have a hand double on deck, but they never needed him. \nAnd Ryan's hard work certainly paid off— La La Land has been sweeping at awards shows. The film won six Golden Globes, including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Ryan, and Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Emma Stone. Ryan was nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role at the SAG Awards, where Stone took home the Actor for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. The Academy Awards are right around the corner on Sunday, Feb. 26—is anyone else hoping Ryan will surprise us with a live piano performance during the broadcast? \nCheck out the behind-the-scenes clips of Ryan, below: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:44:29.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
