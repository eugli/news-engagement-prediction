In the video, the prosecutor says she was shot eight times at close range in front of their young children. Maricopa County Superior Court \nThe children were unharmed and were being well cared for Wednesday, according to police. Josiah Adam English III (Photo: Maricopa County Sheriff's Office) \nPolice say they have arrested the ex-husband of a woman who was shot and killed while loading their young children into a vehicle early Tuesday.\nJosiah Adam English III of Scottsdale is facing charges of first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in the death of 35-year-old Blanca Gutierrez-Calzoncit, according to Phoenix police.\nGutierrez-Calzoncit was shot eight times at close range with a .22-caliber gun, a county prosecutor told the judge who would set English's bond at $1 million cash.\nPolice said English, 40, and Gutierrez-Calzoncit had been in court recently over custodial issues with their children, ages 3 and 4. Court records show Gutierrez-Calzoncit wanted to move to Mexico with the children, and English was trying to get a judge to keep that from happening.\nProsecutors and police say English wasn't supposed to know where Gutierrez-Calzoncit and the children were living.\nGutierrez-Calzoncit was shot in the parking lot of her north Phoenix apartment complex around 5:50 a.m. Tuesday. She was pronounced dead at the scene. The children were unharmed, but prosecutors said the 3-year-old was nearly hit by a bullet that struck a rear passenger door near where the child had been sitting in a car seat.\nIn court records obtained by The Arizona Republic , Gutierrez-Calzoncit worried that English would track her down. She complained in court records that English had tried to find out where she lived despite her using a false address through the Arizona Address Confidentiality Program. As part of their divorce, she said, English was ordered not to “follow Mother after an exchange or otherwise attempt to locate Mother’s residence.”\nThe day before the murder, Gutierrez-Calzoncit and English had a custody hearing in Maricopa County Superior Court. The judge in their case was considering the mother's request to travel to Mexico with the children.\nSgt. Vince Lewis, a Phoenix police spokesman, said the children were being well cared for Wednesday.\n“In Mexico, Mother would have less fear for her safety, living far away from Father, and would not have to worry about him following her,” Gutierrez-Calzoncit's attorney included in a recent court document.\nEnglish was his own attorney for part of the divorce and child-custody proceedings, which had been ongoing since 2014. He filed handwritten responses to some of her attorney’s filings by using copies of the motions and scrawling counterpoints in the margins.\n“This is requested to cause separation between the father and the children,” English wrote regarding a suggestion that he see the children only on alternating weekends. “The mother Blanca Calzoncit aims to injure the father-child relationship by significantly diminishing my parenting time.”\nElsewhere in the paperwork, English wrote that he has “vigorously defended my name and reputation as a result of the fake assault claim made by Calzoncit and the false and defamatory statements that she and her attorneys have made about me in open court.”\nCLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nPhoenix police have arrested the ex-husband of the woman that was killed Tuesday in front of her children. Wochit \nDuring English's initial appearance Wednesday, the prosecutor said Gutierrez-Calzoncit had been \"documenting a history of domestic violence concerns.\" Part of that documentation including filming each child-custody exchange, some of which occurred at police stations.\n\"There was an email correspondence from the defendant … which is almost an explicit threat, your honor, of what will occur should she go forward with this custodial dispute,\" deputy county attorney Robert Beardsley said, noting that the text of the email had been included in court paperwork.\nPresiding Criminal Judge Sam Myers granted the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office's motion to seal records that outlined the probable cause police developed to arrest English at his home Tuesday evening.\nBeardsley said police executing a search warrant at English's home after his arrest located a .25-caliber gun, but not the suspected murder weapon. Police found 10 .22-caliber shell casings at the shooting scene, and they also found multiple .22-caliber bullets at English's home, according to Beardsley.\nBeardsley said a witness reported seeing a Ford Expedition leaving the shooting scene. Beardsley said records show that English had rented a Ford Expedition that was returned to the rental agency four hours after the shooting.\nLindsay Abramson, the public defender representing English, said she had not yet read the police report and wasn’t going to comment on the allegations at his initial court appearance. “We are not here for a trial,” Abramson said.\nEnglish was being held Wednesday in a Maricopa County jail. His bond was set at $1 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:16:26.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
