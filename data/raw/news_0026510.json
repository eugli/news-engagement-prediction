The singing of the verse brought a stern response from Petkovic and an official statement of apology from the United States Tennis Association.\nA similar anthem gaffe occurred in 2008  when, during an Euro Cup match between Germany and Austria, a Swiss broadcaster aired subtitles of the German anthem that featured the same Nazi-era lyrics.\n'I thought it was the epitome of ignorance' Petkovic, who was born in Bosnia, said in the German-speaking portion of her news conference that she considered walking off the court as the anthem went on.\n\"I thought it was the epitome of ignorance, and I've never felt more disrespected in my whole life, let alone in Fed Cup, and I've played Fed Cup for 13 years now, and it is the worst thing that has ever happened to me,\" Petkovic said after her loss.\n\nEin Versuch der weniger emotionalen Erklärung bzgl. der gestrigen Hymnen Geschichte.
