Sage, who approved class action status. \n\nControversy still surrounds the use. \n\nThe village of New Miami has to pay back drivers for fines collected for nearly two years while the cameras were in place. \n\nIn a ruling handed down on Wednesday, Judge Michael Oester said the money paid to the village gave it an unfair advantage at the expense of speeders. \n\n\nSo now the village has to return the money paid by drivers involved in a class action lawsuit. \n\nThat's a total of about $3 million. \n\nNearly 45,000 people were cited in 15 months. \nAs TheAntiMedia's Josie Wales notes , of the $3 million collected in fines, 60% of the revenue went to the village while 40% went to the traffic light company running the program. The village’s attorney plans to take the case to the Supreme Court, claiming the village should not be responsible for funds it did not receive, seemingly ignoring the fact that it was responsible for implementing the unconstitutional program and collecting the fines in the first place.
