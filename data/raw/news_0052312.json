But should the Frenchman leave, so too could Hector Bellerin. Article continues below What caused an angry reaction from Antoine Greizmann's vs Bayer Leverkusen \nAs per Mundo Deportivo , Barcelona are ready to meet the Gunners' demands for Bellerin, who has become their no.1 summer transfer target with first-choice right-back Aleix Vidal having recently suffered a broken ankle away to Alaves - leaving Sergi Roberto as their alternative option. Wenger influential on Bellerin \nBarcelona are not only ready to throw their financial weight around but also believe their bid to lure arguably the best right-back in the Premier League back to his native Spain could be made easier if Wenger decides to call an end to his near-21 years in charge. \nBellerin, who Arsenal took from La Masia back in 2011, is seen as the perfect right-back acquisition for Barcelona - who failed to sign significant cover for Dani Alves who left for Juventus last summer. \nEnrique instead decided to invest the best part of his transfer budget on signing Valencia's Andre Gomes, but their failures to land a right-back in 2016 will hopefully be resolved this summer. Bellerin transfer request \nBellerin, who was named in the PFA Team of the Year last season, signed a new six-and-a-half year Â£100,000-a-week deal with the Gunners back in November, but the reigning La Liga champions believe the Spaniard will request a move away if Wenger departs. \nThe 21-year-old has performed admirably since making his breakthrough at the Emirates back in 2014, and the fact that his boyhood club have shown an interest, despite letting him go as a kid, will likely be a tough proposition for the young Spain international to turn down. \nWenger's Arsenal career could come to an end in the summer, with the club's fans growing frustrated with their consistent failures, both domestically and in Europe, and Barcelona's interest would represent a fantastic escape route for Bellerin. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
