So I removed that first thing. Main reason I wanted to give this software a try was because I thought it might be a good second opinion Virus scanner. I didn't want to use the real time protection, I wanted to use it as an on demand scanner only. But much to my surprise there is no option to turn off real time protection inside the software. I thought I would try a quick scan and the first thing it asked me was if I wanted to use the Avira scan engine and it said it would produce better scan results if I did. I didn't like that at all because I look at it like this : \"Since they consider the Avira scan engine to be so good then wouldn't it make more sense for me to just use Avira?\". Don't get me wrong, the reason I am commenting here is because first I think others would be interested in more information concerning the software, and secondly because I would hope that the software creators would be interested as to what users think about it. I'm not commenting to trash talk the software at all, just giving my opinion. Thank you for the offer Glarysoft & GOTD.
