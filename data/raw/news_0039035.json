Pizza delivery driver leaves note offering 'weed, MDMA, pills, ket, raw coke & much more' \nThe British Museum, the V&A, historian David Starkey, former English Heritage chief executive Simon Thurley and broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh are among those to speak to the Antiques Trade Gazette against a total ban. \nWilliam, a vociferous environmentalist who has described the ivory trade as ‘abhorrent’, reportedly once said he would like to see all the pieces in the Royal Collection destroyed. \nThe Government is due to consult on plans to ban the sale of items containing ivory dating from 1947 to the present day. He has called ancient artefacts made from ivory ‘artworks of shame’ (Picture: Getty) \nHowever the trade in ‘worked’ items like works of art and ornaments would continue to be allowed. \nAccording to some estimates the global demand for ivory has seen nearly 150,000 elephants lost to poaching in under a decade, wiping out nearly a third of the population. Autistic girl, 16, left with horrific injuries after being attacked by another girl \nIn November William warned officials at an international conference on the illegal wildlife trade that ‘ivory treated as a commodity is the fuel of extinction’. \nHe said: ‘Ivory is not something to be desired and when removed from an elephant it is not beautiful. \n‘So, the question is: why are we still trading it? We need governments to send a clear signal that trading in ivory is abhorrent.’ Alan Titchmarsh wants a ban on modern ivory trading but said there’s nothing to be gained from destroying artwork (Picture: Getty) Prince William said ivory is not something to be desired (Picture: Getty) \nThe British Museum said it supported any efforts to protect elephants and to curb the illegal trade and export of ivory, but stressed this should not include antiques. \n‘There is no public benefit in restricting the display or movement of ivory works of art made before 1947 and legislation should not extend to cover actions carried out before that date,’ a spokesman said. Seagull caught stealing people's parking tickets \nThe V&A said it will still consider acquiring objects featuring or made from ivory dating from before 1947 ‘where there is a strong link to the collection and within relevant regulations and guidelines’. \nTelevision presenter and antiques expert Philip Mould said: ‘The thought that, say, some of our most emotive miniature portraits of Nelson, Byron and the young Queen Victoria become persona non grata – artworks of shame for which there is no market – is up there with book-burning and recent cultural vengeance meted out on the buildings of ancient Syria.’ \nMr Starkey said the effects of a total ban would amount to ‘cultural vandalism’. \n‘If these objects cease to be tradeable they lose their value and will end up being destroyed,’ he said. \nTitchmarsh said he fully supported a ban on ‘modern’ ivory, but added: ‘There is nothing to be gained by destroying works of art which were created in a less enlightened age’. \nMeanwhile Mr Thurley said: ‘This trend for countries to outdo each other [by] zero tolerance is monstrous.’ \nIn 2014 leading primatologist Jane Goodall told the Independent on Sunday that William had told her he would ‘like to see all the ivory owned by Buckingham Palace destroyed’.
