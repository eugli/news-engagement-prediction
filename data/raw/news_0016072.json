Process time-consuming \nDr Thums and her colleague Curt Jenner have since spent long days trawling through the digital images. \n\"It turns out because the satellite imagery is really high resolution, we can see the whales with quite a bit of certainty, although it is a time-consuming process,\" she said. \n\"It's been really surprising, we've been able to see the whales really easily with the human eye. \n\"That's great and it's looking like it's got heaps of potential to be a method we can use in the future.\" \nIt is an exciting project for veteran whale researcher Curt Jenner, who also runs the Centre for Whale Research in Perth. \nHe has done long stints at sea tracking the movements of the migrating whales, and said he had dreamt of a more high-tech way to accurately gauge whale numbers. \n\"I'd been trying to do this in an armchair in my spare time, looking at Google Earth images and trying to find spots where on the WA coast and see if I could find a whale, but I could never do it, so it was frustrating,\" Mr Jenner said. \n\"So as we got these images with 30cm resolution and 40 pixels covering a particular whale, it was incredible, you can see a lot of detail on these whales, so it's a fascinating thing,\" Scanning system under development \nThe pair are conducting a cost-benefit analysis of the technique, which is only being used in a handful of research projects internationally, to see if a long-term monitoring program is viable. \nThey are also trying to develop a computerised scanning system that can spot the whales within the black and white satellite images. \nIt is thought humpback whale numbers have been increasing by about 10 per cent each year since hunting was banned in the 1970s. \nCurt Jenner said that was largely speculative, and accurate monitoring was needed to work out exactly how the once-endangered species was faring. \n\"People say, 'the whale numbers are very healthy aren't they?' Well we can't actually honestly say yes to that, we don't know because we haven't had a monitoring program for this largest humpback population on the planet for about 10 years,\" he said. \n\"So we're very interested to find out if this very large number of whales can be sustained and whether it is healthy enough to continue on into the future.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:14:04.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
