Mack plays for Utah Rec Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports This is Sheldon McClellan. He’s currently a rookie with the Washington Wizards. He’s changing his last name. Sheldon will now go by Sheldon Mac. It's real: #Wizards rookie Sheldon McClellan has legally changed his name to Sheldon Mac. — Candace Buckner (@CandaceDBuckner) February 23, 2017 Name changes are common in basketball. One of the more notable changes in recent memory is Ron Artest changing his name to Metta World Peace. This one, however, isn’t as eyebrow-raising as World Peace’s was. I have officially changed my last name!!! It's no longer mcclellan!!! — Sheldon Mac (@sheldonmacc) February 21, 2017 It’s great that Mac is making the change, one that he considered during college but decided to hold off on to not confuse NBA scouts . The name change will confuse some NBA fans at first. A quick google search will confuse Sheldon Mac with Shelvin Mack. Shelvin Mack is currently playing for the Utah Jazz. So while this isn’t ideal for Mac’s brand, whatever that means, don’t get these two names confused.
