A series of unfortunate events continue to plague the South Korean consumer giant, the latest of which is the arrest of company chief Jay. Y. Lee earlier today on corruption charges. Lee, who’s 48 years old, was arrested under investigation in connection with a scandal that’s unfolding at the very highest levels of South Korea’s rich and powerful. The same scandal led the South Korean parliament to impeach President Park Geun-hye in December last year. Both Samsung and Lee have denied any wrongdoing in the case, but that hasn’t stopped the growing sense of unease around the company. Lee was arrested on charges of bribery and exerting undue pressure and influence. \"We will do our best to ensure that the truth is revealed in future court proceedings,\" the Samsung Group said in a brief statement after Lee's arrest. While Lee's arrest and temporary incarceration isn’t expected to affect day-to-day operations at Samsung, experts are claiming that there could be some hindrance in terms of strategic decision-making at South Korea's biggest conglomerate. The company is in the middle of a restructuring, critical staff moves are also in limbo -- staff promotions are on hold since December, when they’re traditionally announced. \nWhat’s more, the highly-anticipated Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to launch next month . Get it together already, Samsung! \nInputs from TOI ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T10:13:06.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
