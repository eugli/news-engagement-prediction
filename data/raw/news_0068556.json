The action star, who's always on the move, sat down with his 'Commando 2' co-star Adah Sharma for a conversation to promote the release of their film. ‘Commando 2’ trailer: Vidyut Jammwal is back with a bang After giving us the action fest ‘Commando’ in 2013, Vidyut Jammwal is back with its second instalment ‘Commando 2’. The sequel to the 2013 hit 'Commando' takes an international turn by shifting base to Thailand, and with a bigger star-cast as opposed to the earlier film. \"'Commando' was the launch of the biggest action film in India. For the sequel, we picked up the issue of black money for our story. It's a big issue in our country, that reflects even in the condition of our streets. Things aren't as good as they should be. So, a commando is hired to bring back the black money from foreign shores.\" Adah Sharma, who plays Bhavna Reddy, a Telugu-speaking girl in the film is also on the black money trail in Thailand with Vidyut, but her character is \"not very interested in the mission\". \"She is from a small town, and she's getting out of India for the first time. She wants to shop and go sightseeing,\" she said. When asked how working with each other for the first time was like, Vidyut joked \"Adah had a great time working with me. She's learned so much from me!\" On a serious note, Vidyut added that he had a pleasant time shooting with Adah. \"I've built a good friendship with her. She's simply great on the sets.\" He flashed his cheeky side again and said, \"I have taught her so much, and it's been a privilege for her.\" Akshay Kumar 's 2007 chartbuster 'Hare Krishna Hare Ram' has been recreated by the duo of Gourov - Roshin, and features Vidyut, Adah, Esha Gupta and Freddy Daruwala swaying to the beats, originally created by Pritam for 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa'. When asked what their favourite song from the film's soundtrack was, both of them agreed on the romantic number 'Tere Dil Mein'. Vidyut also claimed that he likes the film's title track a lot too. 'Commando 2' releases on March 3, 2017 and the actors urged their fans to catch the film only in cinema halls. \"The kind of action we have pulled off in the film can only be enjoyed on the big screen, and not on small screens and cell phones,\" said Vidyut. Much in the spirit of their playful chemistry, Adah added \"If you don't watch the film in theatres, Vidyut will beat you to a pulp. Have you seen his muscles?\" pointing towards his well-sculpted, albeit covered up biceps.
