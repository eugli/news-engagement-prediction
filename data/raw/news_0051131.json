Their collections interpreted the deep heritage of Indian textiles and handlooms for a global audience. \nFor designer [KA] [SHA] by Karishma Shahani Khan (Womenswear), the inspiration for the exhibit stands as an ode to one of India’s most iconic pastoral nomads, the Rabaris who are predominantly based in Kutch. For Kaleekal by Alan Alexander Kaleekal (Menswear), the inspiration is from the Todas in the Nilgiri Hills, South India. \nIkai by Ragini Ahuja (Womenswear) has drawn inspiration from the Drokpa in Ladakh, in northern India, whereas PELLA by Priyanka Ella Lorena Lama (Womenswear) has drawn inspiration from Lachen and Lachung tribes of Sikkim in north-east India. \nAnd last but not the least, Antar-Agni by Ujjawal Dubey (Menswear) has taken inspiration from the Van Gujjars of the Himalayas in northern India. \nThe exhibition featured conceptual installation elements designed in collaboration with spatial design expert Wasim Khan and sustainable furniture designer Sandeep Sangaru. \n“Through initiatives such as the International Fashion Showcase 2017, we will present India’s emerging talent on prestigious international platforms for global exposure. IMG Reliance through its lead platform Lakmé Fashion Week has always delivered compelling stories around sustainable fashion and focused on supporting young and emerging designers and this is an extension of the same,” said Jaspreet Chandok, Head of Fashion, IMG Reliance. \n“This victory showcases the true power of the young Indian designer mind that is breaking pre-conceived notions on Indian Fashion in the world. This puts Indian Fashion on the map like never before – I’ve been told that the entire London Fashion Week is buzzing about our installation and design talent,” he added. \nJaspreet said, “We’d like to thank 6Degree and Etihad Airways for their support in taking the lead to promote young Indian design talent across the world.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:49:35.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
