Over bouncy bedroom disco beats and teasing riffs, they (DeFrancesco’s preferred pronoun) drawls evocative lines about otherness (“I guess I’ll wait till I’m invited”), “the backlash,” and the violence of rigid categorization (“Hit a nail on the head and the blood runs out”). That bored confidence lends their voice the same subversive and urgent power that Downtown Boys achieve through speed and volume. In the accompanying music video, DeFrancesco defiantly struts through the King of Prussia Mall in Pennsylvania—now, of course, a red state—wearing a mini skirt, crop top and heels, layers of lavender hair framing a full face of makeup. Like the work of Mykki Blanco , Perfume Genius , and the generations of queer dissidents who came before them, this is flamboyance as revolutionary praxis. “American Sounds” claims enough space for non-binary bodies like DeFrancesco’s to not only stand, but sprawl out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:45:57.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
