Jeff Sessions has been confirmed as the new attorney general of the United States -- capping a contentious process that involved protests from his Democratic colleagues. \nThe Senate voted tonight 52-47 in favor of Sessions' confirmation. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia was the lone Democrat to vote for confirmation, while Sessions himself voted present. \nThe Alabama Republican, 70, faced a contentious confirmation process. His nomination for the position had been strongly opposed by Democrats and civil rights groups since then-President-elect Donald Trump tapped him in mid-November. Many critics have cited concerns about past allegations of racism , his record on civil rights and immigration and his failure to be confirmed as a federal judge in 1986 as key points of contention. \nSessions attempted to address some of these concerns during his cabinet hearing in early-January. Speaking to allegations that he had made racist remarks decades ago as Alabama attorney general, Sessions said, \"I hope my tenure in this body shows you that the caricature of me wasn't accurate. It wasn't accurate then, and it's not accurate now.\" \nHis reputation and qualifications for the attorney general post were also defended by a number of his Republican colleagues. \n\"He is a man of honor and integrity, dedicated to the faithful and fair enforcement of the law, who knows well and deeply respects the Department of Justice and its role,\" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa, said in his opening remarks. \nMinutes after his colleagues confirmed him to be the next Attorney General, Sessions took to the floor to thank them and deliver his last remarks. \n\"I can't express how grateful I am for all of you who stood by me during this difficult time,” he said, alluding to the fight Democrats staged against his nomination. \nSessions said he appreciates the \"full debate\" the Senate had and thanked those who \"found sufficient confidence\" in him to cast their vote. \nWhile on the floor, Sessions also delivered his letter of resignation, which he will also deliver to Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley. \nThe president took to Twitter to congratulate Sessions on his confirmation as Attorney General.
