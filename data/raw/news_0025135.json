I want to THANK YOU all for taking the time to read my story, helping to share this page and for your donations. I appreciate it all more than you will ever know.* (Below is my story) What I'm about to share with you all is extremely personal and private, however, if I don't reach out for help, I will continue to SUFFER all ALONE as it's bottled up deep inside me:( I want to make it very CLEAR to those who may think I'm trying to get sympathy or empathy and that's NOT it in anyway PERIOD!!!! Now with that being said, many of you know through my posts on here for over a year now, I SUFFER ENORMOUSLY with severe depression, PTSD, A LOT of health problems and panic/anxiety attacks, which has CRIPPLED my life in every aspects:( In early Nov. 2015, I was rushed to the ER by med flight because the kidney stones had formed together & EXPLODED in my right kidney IMMEDIATELY sending septic infection through my entire body! I had stayed home for 36 hours with a fever of 105*, sweating, freezing, shaking and in ENORMUS PAIN, etc., all the while, I thought it was the flu (WRONG)!!!! I woke up 25 days later from a medial induced coma, thinking I was still in the ER. Once I was able to understand what was going on, I found out that not only had I almost died (literally 5 minutes or less, the doctors told me) I had lost 95% of my long beautiful hair (PERMENATELY), most of my eye brows and eye lashes:( You can only imagine the HORRIFIC SHOCK I was in!!!! I cried for many, many months and having no other choice, I had to buy a wig (that my insurance didn't cover, of course)!!!! Having NEVER gone through anything like this, it cost me $600.00 for a human hair wig. Later on I found out I was taken advantage of on the price of the wig and the salon I bought it from had a \"lifetime\" warranty on it or they said they did until I took mine back to be washed and cut the way I wanted it. I got some BS excuse that they don't have such warranties and would have to pay to have it washed, cut and styled, BS!!!! So now I have a beautiful wig I can't even wear, ugh:( Along with loosing most of my hair, the medications I have to be on for my kidney, has made me gain ENORMOUS weight that I worked so hard on loosing and kept off for over 15 years....Furthermore, the septic infection attacked the calcium in my jaw bones and ate all of the enamel on all of my teeth! Which in turn, I've now just had to have every single one of my teeth pulled and MUST wait at least 6-8 weeks before I can even begin to look into getting dentures:( The day AFTER I had this oral surgery, I got another SHOCK of a lifetime, my entire mouth and checks are completely SUNK in and I look like I've aged 20 years OLDER:( I just broke down in tears sobbing!!!! I couldn't believe what I was seeing in the mirror looking back at me?!?! A HORRIFIC monster, is what I see!Now, I'm left to researching a place to get the full mouth dentures and I've learned that my dental insurance doesn't cover the cost of any type of dentures, so I'm left to figure out how I'm going to be able to pay for them? And in the middle of all this, I lost my BEAUTIFUL BELOVED Molly on 12/10/16, had an EMERGENCY appendectomy surgery in June 2016 and was in the hospital for over 2 weeks and now, I'm in the middle of a divorce, ugh:( As I said earlier in this post, I'm NOT in anyway trying to get sympathy or empathy, just reaching out for help with suggestions, guidance, people's thoughts. I am absolutely HUMILIATED, EMBARRASSED, STRESSED and OVERWHELMED with everything that's going on, as well as STRUGGLING with my depression. I'm doing my best to hang on and get through all of this. THANK YOU everyone who was their for me when I lost my SWEET PRECIOUS Molly, it means the world to me....", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:05:59.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
