'I am hopefully this government will take the necessary action to protect the public from these rip off merchants.' He said he himself had been affected when he had tried to buy four Green Day tickets only for them to be 'snaffled by a bot attack'. Pressure on the government to get tough on touting has been building amid outrage from the music industry. Fans have reacted with fury after tickets for their favourite bands have sold out within seconds on official sites, only to then spot them on secondary sites at inflated prices. Tickets for gigs and the theatre frequently appear on resale websites within minutes of going on sale, often at huge mark-ups. The law would be similar to one already passed in the US. Tickets for Phil Collins's tour sold out on Ticketmaster in seconds in November last year - but were spotted on sale on other websites for more than £2,000 The offence would carry a prison term of up to a year and a fine of up to £5,000, or both. The fine could wipe out the potential profit on resale of a ticket. Members of the House of Lords have also put forward other amendments to the bill. These amendments would result in websites that let touts resell tickets being prosecuted unless they have permission from event organisers. Campaigners say this would outlaw much of the controversial ticket resale industry, dominated by websites Viagogo, StubHub, Seatwave and GetMeIn. Singers Adele and Ed Sheeran and the producers of hit musical Hamilton have taken steps to prevent their tickets being resold at inflated prices. But they have seen touts circumvent their efforts with relative ease. Tickets for Phil Collins's tour sold out on Ticketmaster in seconds in November last year. But the £55 tickets were later spotted selling on other websites for more than two thousand pounds. In one of his last actions in the White House, President Obama outlawed computer 'bots' that harvest sports and gig seats. The Better Online Ticket Sales Act of 2016 makes it a US federal offence for ticket touts to use sophisticated computer software to buy huge amounts. It followed a report by the attorney general that found that touts using a single bot had bought 1,000 tickets in one minute for a U2 concert.
