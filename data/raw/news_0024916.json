Let me know if you come across other examples of particular interest. Visit \"The Praying Mantis Reports\" \"This is an informal collection of tales regarding the strangest of possibilities -- encounters with praying-mantis like entities which occur after ingesting enteogenic compounds. Why is this so common? Nobody seems to mention spiders or grasshoppers, always mantids!\" \nFor more information on DMT, click here . Report emailed to me from \"Paul\" \nCliff, 3 years ago I had a random encounter with DMT. I went to someones house to collect some rent money they owed me, and when I got there this person was kind of \"spacey\" acting. We started talking, and he told me someone had given him DMT, and that I should try it. I told him I would try it after watching him \"take it\" two or three times. After watching him take it without any negative side effects, I decided to try it. \nI tried it twice. One pull off the glass pipe. \nThe first time, I had the plastic cracking sound, and got really close to slipping into the \"other world\". But, apparently I didn't have enough, because I slipped back into reality. \nThe second time, I took one really long pull, held it in, and immediately heard the \"plastic crackly\" sound. Then I had my first \"DMT\" experience. This was in the middle of the day, in the middle of the week. Not a planned \"session\" or \"trip\". I went through the \"crackling sound\", I went into a world where everything was pix-elated,. Everything in the room was at a molecular level, visually. The pitbull in the room, looked different. It was made up of molecular, swirling, small balls of color. As I was looking around the room, I heard a helicopter fly over the house, so I looked up. When I looked up, I could see through the walls and ceiling. I could see out into the front yard, the trees, the house across the street. etc. Just then, I was looking at the oak tree in the front yard, and I saw a saucer shaped ufo, appear hovering, over the front yard. That is when I felt the presence of the Praying Mantis. The UFO was on my left, then the Praying Mantis appeared at my right. The Praying Mantis, telepathically, realized I saw it, and I was looking at it. Then, the Mantis, moved in really really close. For a brief moment, I felt sheer terror. This thing was gigantic, 10-20 ft tall. But the head of this Praying Mantis, was as big as my body. I realized this thing was big enough to devour me. The Praying Mantis moved in really close, almost nose to nose. Then it was scanning me. Like it scanned my brain. It was actually trying to calm me while it was looking at me. After it \"looked at me\", it almost smiled. Just then, the cracking plastic sound started coming back, and I looked at the Praying Mantis, and it almost said to me telepathically \"Bye!\" \nThen the experience was over. Afterwards, I was fine. Like nothing happened. I was slightly groggy for 5-10min. Then i was completely fine. I started Googling Mantis-DMT, and I found your website. Just wanted to tell you I was really surprised to find that other people have seen a Praying Mantis on DMT. I still don't know what to think about it. Just wanted to tell you my story. Thanks for letting me tell my story. \n- - - - For my science fiction novel, The Lobotomy Club , which features praying-mantis entities from a parallel universe -- induced by brain surgery -- click here . \nReturn to Reality Carnival.
