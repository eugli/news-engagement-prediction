Bex Walton via Flickr \nMirrors, selfies and pumpkin patches don’t mix. Just ask the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington D.C., where, over the weekend, a visitor trying to snap a pic apparently tripped and fell , smashing a ceramic glowing pumpkin likely worth almost $800,000 , according to Artnet. \nThe sculpture is part of Japanese feminist artist Yayoi Kusama’s “Infinity Mirrors,” open since last Friday at the Hirschhorn, a series of mirrored, polka-dotted installations that have captivated the art world and everyday Instagrammers alike. \nThe snafu has left the room, “Infinity Mirrored Room — All the Eternal Love I have for the Pumpkins,” which is Kusama’s most recent “infinity room,” closed for the time being, according to Hyperallergic. When it reopens there will be an increased staff presence, a spokesperson for the museum told the website. \nThe small rooms of the “Infinity Mirrors” show had already resulted in the museum’s first ever use of staggered entry , as the institution anticipated high demand for the very popular artist and there’s only room for a maximum of three people to experience the room at one time. \nIt does not appear that any charges will be filed against the un-named pumpkin smasher.
