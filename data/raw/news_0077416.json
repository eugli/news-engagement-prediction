The study of epistemology focuses on our means for acquiring knowledge and how we can differentiate between truth and falsehood. Modern epistemology generally involves a debate between rationalism and empiricism, or the question of whether knowledge can be acquired a priori or a posteriori: \nEmpiricism : knowledge is obtained through experience. \nRationalism : knowledge can be acquired through the use of reason. Why is Epistemology Important? \nEpistemology is important because it is fundamental to how we think. Without some means of understanding how we acquire knowledge, how we rely upon our senses, and how we develop concepts in our minds, we have no coherent path for our thinking. A sound epistemology is necessary for the existence of sound thinking and reasoning â€” this is why so much philosophical literature can involve seemingly arcane discussions about the nature of knowledge. \nUnfortunately, atheists who frequently debate questions that derive from differences in how people approach knowledge aren't always familiar with this subject. If they were, their discussions with religious theists might become more productive. Why Does Epistemology Matter to Atheism? \nMany debates between atheist and theists revolve around fundamental issues which people don't recognize or never get around to discussing. Many of these are epistemological in nature: in disagreeing about whether it's reasonable to believe in the existence of god , to believe in miracles , to accept revelation and scriptures as authoritative, and so forth, atheists and theists are ultimately disagreeing about basic epistemological principles. Without understanding this and understanding the various epistemological positions, people will just end up talking past each other. Epistemology, Truth, and Why We Believe What We Believe \nAtheists and theists differ in what they believe: theists believe in some god , atheists do not. Although their reasons for believing or not believing vary, it's common for atheists and theists to also differ in what they consider to be appropriate criteria for truth and, therefore, the proper criteria for a reasonable belief. Theists commonly rely upon criteria like tradition, custom, revelation, faith, and intuition. Atheists common reject these criteria in favor of correspondence, coherence, and consistency. Without discussing these different approaches, debates over what ones believes are unlikely to go very far. Questions Asked in Epistemology How can we know it? Why do we know some things, but not others? How do we acquire knowledge?
