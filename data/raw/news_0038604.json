According to organizers at W magazine, the clip is designed to make a “defiant” statement of unity. \nThe minute-and-a-half video is a powerful who’s-who of influential fashion folk, who “aren’t as insulated as they might seem,” wrote W’s Katherine Cusumano . “They’ve been equally appalled by the rhetoric stemming from Washington, perhaps because so many members of this colorful community are immigrants themselves , certainly friends, partners, collaborators, admirers of immigrant artists and designers.” \n“ I am an Immigrant ” was released just one day after restaurants in several major cities participated in the “A Day Without Immigrants” protest , closing their doors to show what our country would look like without the immigrant community that’s the bedrock of the restaurant industry. Clearly, as this video proves, the fashion industry would suffer greatly as well.
