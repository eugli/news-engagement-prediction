'Anyone doing so could inadvertently be contributing to an impending welfare crisis. 'The breed is a favourite with celebrities, who often flaunt them on their Instagram and Twitter accounts for people to coo over. However, the club is concerned by the rise because it is being driven by fashion, opening the door for those who do not care for a dog's health and welfare 'While it's normal to want to show off your dog, when celebrities do it, it usually results in a surge in the popularity of certain breeds, which is not a good thing as it opens the doors to unscrupulous breeders who see it as an opportunity to breed lots of them without due care to health and welfare.' She added that it was crucial for anyone intent on owning a French Bulldog to go a responsible breeder, such as a Kennel Club assured breeder. The UK's largest dog welfare organisation is urging people to consider buying other similar breeds that may be better suited to their lifestyle and environment. These include the Miniature Schnauzer, Beagle, Border Terrier and Welsh Terrier.
