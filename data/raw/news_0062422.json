(Getty Images) \nArsene Wenger has given Mesut Ozil an extended break as the Arsenal midfielder is attempting to recover from back spasms, according to reports. \nThe Times claim that the 28-year-old has been playing with pain in his back in recent weeks, which is why he was left out of the victory over Sutton United in the FA Cup on Monday evening. \nThe Gunners, who sit fourth in the Premier League and 10 points behind leaders Chelsea, do not play again until March 4 when they travel to Liverpool. Ozil has been suffering from back spasms. (Getty Images) \nWenger has granted Ozil a period of rest and the midfielder will now spent time in Germany and Turkey before returning to full training at the end of this week. \nOzil was heavily criticised for his display in Arsenalâ€™s 5-1 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League last week, although his agent, Dr Erkut Sogut, insists the backlash was excessive.
