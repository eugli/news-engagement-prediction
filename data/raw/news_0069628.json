Share this video Watch Next     soaps   EastEnders viewers have unearthed a great big plot hole in one of the soap's current storylines.\nFans of the show called out Albert Square writers over the Queen Vic leak plotline, saying it couldn't possibly be true... but it looks like this isn't the case.\nBritain's best loved fictional pub was vandalised, then sprung a leak - which was discovered by an inspector when she tripped over a bucket collecting the water the leak from the ceiling was spewing forth.\nLandlord Mick Carter (played by Danny Dyer) told the inspector, \"You know how old this place is!\" And that's when things seemingly to unravel.\nShirley and Mick stare wistfully at the leak (Photo: BBC) Mick (played by Danny Dyer) explained it was because the pub was so old (Photo: BBC) The offending ceiling leak (Photo: BBC) The Queen Vic, in all her wondrous glory Technically, the Vic was built \"around 1860\", according to the pub's backstory, and was renovated in 2010 after it suffered massive fire damage when Phil Mitchell burned the place down.\nSo, in short, the interior's just over six years old and some viewers got their knickers in a twist about it.\n\"The Vic old? It only got rebuilt post Phil burning it down a few years ago,\" tweeted one viewer, while another added, \"The Vic ceiling must have been renewed the last time the gaff was torched?\"\n\"The Vic old? It only got rebuilt post Phil burning it down a few years ago,\" tweeted another.\nBut it's not as straightfoward as that alleged structural anomaly.\n\"The Vic wasn't actually rebuilt after the fire,\" a source told Mirror Online. \"It was just redecorated.\"\nWhich explains A LOT. \"Viewers should keep watching and all will become clear,\" adds the source.\nRead More EastEnders boozer The Queen Vic under threat after Mick Carter's Aunt Babe arrested   Soaps Newsletter Follow @MirrorTV Subscribe to our Soaps   Danny Dyer EastEnders Soap operas", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:55:44.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
