The Interceptor guided by high accuracy Inertial Navigation System (INS) supported by a Redundant Micro Navigation System moved towards the estimated point of the interception. \n\nOnce the missile crossed the atmosphere, the Heat Shield ejected and the IR Seeker dome opened to look at the Target location as designated by the Mission Computer. \n\nWith the help of Inertial Guidance and IR Seeker the missile moved for interception. All events were monitored in real-time by the Telemetry/Range Stations, at various other locations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:24:57.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
