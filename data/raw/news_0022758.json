He serves one meal for DiCaprio and thinks that made him untouchable? You go viral, get that level of famous, obviously there’s a little ego there. Hell consider the fact that his popularity primarily depends upon him tenderly sprinkling salt all over his hairy Mediterranean body and using it as a vessel to serve food to people, that’s a great reason for some extra self-confidence. But now he’s dancing around with dead bodies like he’s Patrick Bateman, shoving roses in their ass, I don’t know man. I admire him for breaking the salt out at the end and trying to get outside of his one hit wonder fame unlike so many bands from the 80s and 90s. But I will go out on a limb to say shoving flowers into the orifices of dead things, dripping unknown fluids onto them, and dancing around to covers of Frankie Valli hits is typically not the answer no matter what the question. \nSo I guess it’s back to the drawing board, Salt Bae, your heat check is over. Time to take a cold hard look in the mirror and recognize there’s only one man who can pull off the irrational confidence game in perpetuity: Chris Spags |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:05:55.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
