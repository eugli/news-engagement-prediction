Cavani-Suarez: An assassins' duel \nBut with the Catalans in a precarious position in LaLiga, success in the Champions League has become even more important and Luis Enrique's men know that an away win in Paris could prove to be desperately important in the long-run. \nBarcelona head into the clash with resounding confidence off the back of a 6-0 thrashing against Alaves, and whilst it wasn't their most dominant performance, it served as a reminder of their effectiveness in front of goal. \nMessi, in particular, has been in fine touch in recent fixtures, having scored in 22 consecutive matches away from home. \nThe last time the former Ballon d'Or winner failed to do so was back on April 13 last year when Barcelona were eliminated from the Champions League by Atletico Madrid after losing 2-0 at the Estadio Vicente Calderon. \nGiven the club's inconsistent performances of late, all eyes will undoubtedly be on Messi once again as he hopes to lead the club to yet another victory in Paris.
