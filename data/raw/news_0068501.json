Case in point: today he opens his latest restaurant in the Magic City, French eatery La Petite Maison . This marks the first U.S. outpost for the almost 30-year-old brand. La Petite Maison was founded in Nice, France in 1988 and was a favorite of Waney’s when visiting his summer home near Nice. So naturally he did what all successful restauranteurs do and he entered into a business deal to garner ownership rights of the brand to expand the concept, opening the first one outside of Nice in London in 2007. It has since expanded to locations in Dubai, Istanbul and Beirut. The 4,600-square-feet Miami location, which set up shop at 1300 Brickell Bay Drive, is the first U.S. outpost for the brand and it stays true to the original serving a menu of French-Mediterranean cuisine with Italian influences cuisine like Nicoise Salad, fish baked en papillote with lemon and herbs, whole roast chicken with foie gras, and what is described as a “house favorite,” creamy scrambled eggs with truffle. La Petite Maison Miami is now open Monday through Saturday for lunch and dinner. Lunch is served Monday through Friday from noon to 2:30 p.m. and Saturday from 12:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. Dinner is available Monday through Saturday from 6 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Call 305-403-9133 or for more information. — All photography by Michael Pisarri In this Storystream", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:15:01.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
