But she warns that the job is not all glitz and glamour and involves a lot of study and weekend work with long shifts up to 16 hours. The happy couple snuggle up while sailing around Capri The couple enjoying the sunrise on safari in Tanzania Eser and Volkan on their wedding day in 2015 on the beach in the Seychelles Eser, who flies for Pegasus airlines, says that being a pilot is the best job in the world despite the long shifts and anti social hours Often she wakes up with no idea where she is and is used to seeing the inside of a lot of hotel rooms.

Now Eser hopes that her example will encourage more women to get into aviation, which is still very much a male dominated industry. According to the International Society of Women Airline Pilots (ISA) there are only around 4,000 female pilots in the world. That's just over three per cent of the 130,000 total. 'From the bottom of my heart I hope more girls would choose this career since it's still a pretty much male-dominated industry,' Eser said.
