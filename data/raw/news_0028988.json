From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. \nThose are the famous words that start Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet (replacing the Verona bit, obviously) but could equally apply to this story. Teenager 'watched the clock for 30 minutes as he strangled friend to death' \nA fight broke out during a rehearsal dinner for an elaborate wedding and has now led to a lawsuit being filed. \nThe groom’s parents objected to a toast being given to the now former couple, sparking a fight. \nBradley Moss, 32, and Amy Bzura, 27, had spent $325,000 (£260,000) on the wedding so their families are now at war over the bill. (Picture: Instagram) \nHis parents, Robert and Wendy Moss, hosted a dinner where the bride’s brother, Adam, presented a video tribute and made a heartfelt toast, according to the New York Post . \nBut then his parents became offended, according to the law suit, and his father, Robert ‘inexplicably and angrily declared that Adam was not allowed to speak at the dinner’. \nSome threats were exchanged and things began to escalate with the bride allegedly asking her groom ‘Make a choice: Me or your mother.’ \nHis mother called the guests to tell them the news. \nThe legal papers claim that Amy was unable to collect her belongings because Bradley’s family had changed the locks. It also states that Robert Moss told his son that if he married Amy he would be disinherited and fired from his job. \nBradley has filed a lawsuit requesting the return of the $125,000 engagement ring while the parents are battling it out over the $1,100-a-head reception. \nThe Moss family told the New York Post the lawsuit was bogus and they were looking ‘forward to answering these baseless allegations’.
