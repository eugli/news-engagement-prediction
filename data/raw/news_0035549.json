"text": "Three US senators, including former presidential candidate Marco Rubio, reintroduced a shelved Hong Kong human rights bill on Friday that would establish “punitive measures” against government officials in Hong Kong and mainland China who suppress basic freedoms in the city.\nThe Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is a piece of bipartisan legislation first proposed in the wake of the 2015 disappearances of the five Causeway Bay booksellers , all of whom eventually resurfaced on the mainland.\nActivists Wong and Lai ‘had right to freedom of expression breached’ at National Day protest \nIt would “renew the United States’ historical commitment to freedom and democracy in Hong Kong at a time when its autonomy is increasingly under assault,” according to a statement on the website of Rubio, co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC).\n“The importance of this legislation was further impressed upon me late last year after meeting with pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong [Chi-fung] ,” Rubio said.\n\nDescribing Wong, a well-known pro-democracy campaigner in Hong Kong, as an “impressive and thoughtful young man”, the senator for Florida said the city “must not go the way of Beijing’s failed authoritarianism and one-party rule”.\nIn response, Wong said: “On the eve of the 20th anniversary of the city’s handover to China, I believe it is an appropriate time [to reintroduce the bill].”\nHong Kong’s freedom score down due to Beijing’s influence: US-based report \nWong, who was the face of Occupy Central in Western media coverage of the 79-day protests in 2014, said the bill would increase the democratic movement’s bargaining power, and that he hoped to attend future hearings hosted by the US Congress on the bill.\n\n“I’d be happy to see the bill passed soon,” he said.\nThe bill would require the US president to identify people responsible for the surveillance, abduction, detention, or forced confessions of booksellers and journalists, and other actions suppressing basic freedoms in the city, and to freeze their US-based assets and deny them entry to the country.\nIt also requires US authorities not to deny visa applications from Hong Kong residents on the basis of their arrest or detention associated with the Occupy protests.\nBan on Buddhist bead bracelet violated my religious freedom, Hong Kong prison guard claims \n“This bill would empower the [US] president to hold Beijing accountable and send a strong message to Chinese officials, that attempts to undermine liberty in Hong Kong and walk away from their promises will not be without consequences,” said Senator Tom Cotton, who co-drafted the bill.\n“The United States must lead the world in ensuring that the Chinese government ceases any repressive acts in Hong Kong and abides by its three-decade-old international commitment to respect the autonomy of Hong Kong,” he said.\nThe third co-drafter was Ben Cardin, a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:36:14.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
