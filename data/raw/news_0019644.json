Phil Jackson (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 4:32 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 4:32 p.m. ET \nKnicks president Phil Jackson sent a confusing tweet Tuesday regarding Carmelo Anthony. Bleacher's Ding almost rings the bell, but I learned you don't change the spot on a leopard with Michael Graham in my CBA daze. — Phil Jackson (@PhilJackson11) February 7, 2017 \nOK, so what on Earth does that mean? The wording is confusing, he spelled days as \"daze\" for no apparent reason, and the tweet has absolutely no context. So let's break down what he's saying, and why despite not mentioning him, this tweet is about Anthony. \nMORE: 2017 Midseason NBA awards \n\"Bleacher's Ding\" refers to Bleacher Report's NBA writer, Kevin Ding. He wrote an article Tuesday claiming Jackson wants Anthony \"to be something he is not,\" as the headline notes. Here's an excerpt that briefly explains what the article is about: \nAnthony is a likable person who just happens to be nothing near Jordan or Bryant in will to win. No, Jackson never thought Anthony had that fire, but he thought he could balance Anthony's ball dominance by teaching teamwork and converting talent into a clear net positive. \nThat was part of the formula with Jordan and Bryant. \nThis season has further disproved that formula with Anthony. \nEssentially, Jackson is saying Ding's article is close to correct, but that he always knew who Anthony was. Safe to say that Phil believes he knows who Carmelo is and what his spots were and are. — KEVIN DING (@KevinDing) February 7, 2017 \nJackson then makes a reference to Michael Graham, a player he coached in the Continental Basketball Association, or \"CBA.\" \nHere's what Jackson wrote about Graham in his book \"Sacred Hoops.\" \nNothing I said made any difference. Whenever I tried to talk to him, his eyes would glaze over and he’d retreat to some dark inner corner nobody could penetrate. Finally I gave up and released him. \nThose are pretty harsh words about Graham, and Jackson is now comparing his former player to Anthony. This is a pretty direct shot from the team president to his franchise player, and perhaps a way to accelerate trade talks with other teams, or get Anthony to waive his no-trade clause. \nAnthony has been mentioned in trade rumors with the Cavs, Celtics and Clippers, but in the meantime, he'll have to live with his boss publicly criticizing him.
