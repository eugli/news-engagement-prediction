That is our best quarter, but we didn't hit shots. It wasn't a matter of being gassed.\"\nJones will face Tallahassee Florida High in the Florida 5A title game Saturday. Florida High advanced after beating Cardinal Gibbons 48-43 earlier in the day.\nOxbridge (23-6) held a 47-32 lead with 1:11 remaining in the third quarter and then the ThunderWolves' shooting went ice cold, allowing Jones to go on a 20-0 run and eventually push the game into overtime.\n\"We were forcing a little bit. We struggled to put together four quarters all year. That's our goal and that seems to be what our struggle is, that we have three-great quarters and one-bad quarter. All of our losses this season have been a result of what you have seen today,\" Wolfe said.\nOxbridge was outscored 14-0 in the fourth quarter and did not score again until sophomore guard Aaliyah Stanley canned a free throw with 1:11 remaining in OT, closing Jones' lead to 52-48.\nJones coach Robert Moultrie said his fourth-quarter message to his team was simple, and in the third quarter, he also scrapped playing zone defense.\n\"The message was everything to the goal on offense. Let's get to the goal. We are going to attack the rim. And on defense, we were just going to take it one possession at a time and what happens, happens. We were going to rebound and attack the basket.\"\nOxbridge actually held a 16-point lead at one point with less than six minutes remaining in the third and after Haley Race hit a free throw with 1:11 left in the third, the scoring drought started.\n\"We have never faced a 16-point deficit and came back, we've never done that. We've come pretty close (to shutting a team out in a quarter). We've have never shut a team out of that caliber,\" Moultrie said.\nTrailing by three points in the closing seconds of overtime, Stanley elected to drive to the basket, hoping to draw a foul and convert a three-point play â€“ instead of pulling up for a 3-point shot. She scored but drew no foul as the game ended, 57-56.\n\"I was going for the foul,\" Stanley said. \"It was me that gave up that game. Letting them comeback was a mistake. Defensively, rebounding, we were challenged. It was a hard game.\"\nStanley, who made several acrobatic drives to the basket, finished with 15 points. Alex Zaph led Oxbridge with 17 points and six rebounds while guard Nasha Gilbert-Taylor added 11 points and nine boards.\nJones was led by Chardell Jones with 21 points and hauled down 12 rebounds while Shania Jacobs added 15.\n Basketball", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-58ae3ae4/turbine/fl-hs-gb-class5a-oxbridge-jones-0222-20170222"], "published": "2017-02-23T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:24:13.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
