Google Earth 1 Teachers at Sandwood primary school in Glasgow have faced a barrage of abuse from parents at home time \nThe headteacher of Sandwood Primary in Glasgow wrote to mums and dads warning they could be banned from the school grounds if they cause further trouble. \nA letter sent last week says there has been a “rising number of incidents where family members have behaved inappropriately towards members of staff, shouting, using offensive language and causing significant stress to staff.” \nParents were told the decision was made “with regret” by the school’s head Fiona Donnelly. \nShe said: “We recognise many parents welcome a catch-up on occasion at the end of the day. \n“However I am not prepared for staff to face this… and for my pupils to witness this behaviour.” She also cites problems with parents “insisting on interrupting” staff.

TRIPLE what PM takes home \nOne parent said: “This is absolutely outrageous that the school has been forced to do this because of some parents’ attitudes. \n“No teachers should be abused like that at work, and there is a serious problem if the head teacher has had to do this. \n“I don’t want my child witnessing (this) when they are meant to be at school learning how to behave. \n“The fact it’s adults doing this is worse – they should be ashamed of themselves.” \nAnother concerned parent whose son attends the school said: “I’ve seen parents being aggressive with teachers and it’s not on. The school has done what they needed to do.” \nSusan Quinn, Glasgow local association secretary at the Educational Institute of Scotland, said: “Generally teachers will work as hard as they can to promote good relationships with parents and carers. \n“It would be an unusual situation that that becomes broken down. \n“Clearly everything has to be done to ensure teacher and pupil safety is the highest consideration.” \nGlasgow City Council said: “The school is introducing a new system to make it easier for parents and carers to contact the school about matters relating to their child’s education. \n“In addition, as the school roll has increased significantly over the last couple of years, the headteacher has devised a playground layout for parents and carers to collect their children at home time. \n“Inappropriate behaviour towards staff is unacceptable.” \nLast week we told how CCTV cameras outside the primary schools in Bournemouth will be used to issue fines to selfish parents who park on zig-zags outside . \nWe pay for your stories!
