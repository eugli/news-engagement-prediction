German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also rejected the manipulation claim . \nMerkel to Trump adviser: We're not manipulating the euro \nDraghi also reacted to Trump's plans to weaken financial regulations . \nTrump has vowed to dismantle the Dodd-Frank reform of Wall Street. The law was enacted in 2010 to safeguard against another financial meltdown. \nThe real estate developer has called the law a \"disaster\" and ordered regulatory agencies to come up with alternatives. \nEurope to Trump: Learn more about the EU \nDraghi said that dismantling regulations was a very bad idea. \n\"The last thing we need at this point in time is a relaxation of regulation,\" he said. \"Nowadays, financial intermediaries are stronger than they were before the crisis, so the idea of repeating the conditions that were in place before the crisis is something that is very worrisome.\" CNNMoney (London) First published February 6, 2017: 11:42 AM ET ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:54:21.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
