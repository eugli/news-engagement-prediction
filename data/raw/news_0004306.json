Two Ukrainian troops were killed overnight and 10 others wounded, the government said, while rebels said one of their fighters was killed. Shelling appeared to intensify after nightfall and both sides reported civilian deaths -- two in Avdiivka and one in Donetsk city.\nReporters for The Associated Press heard Grad rocket launchers fired on both sides of the conflict during the night. In the afternoon, shelling was heard in the distance from Avdiivka, a government-held town just north of Donetsk, the largest rebel-controlled city.\nAt least 15 people have been reported killed since the fighting around Avdiivka surged over the weekend.\nMore than 9,700 people have been killed since the war with separatist rebels began in April 2014. An agreement reached nearly two years ago called for a cease-fire and a pullback of heavy weaponry by both sides, but skirmishes persist.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday accused Ukraine of starting the latest escalation to rally support from the new U.S. administration and other Western powers.\nUkraine is concerned that President Donald Trump could roll back some sanctions imposed on Russia for its actions in Ukraine, and that European Union members could follow suit.\n\"The Ukrainian leadership needs money, and the best way to get the EU, the U.S. and international organizations to pay is by posing as a victim of aggression,\" Putin said in Budapest after a meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\nLater Thursday, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley condemned Russia's \"aggressive actions\" in eastern Ukraine and warned Moscow that U.S. sanctions imposed after its annexation of Crimea will remain until the peninsula is returned to Ukraine.\nThe new American envoy said it was \"unfortunate\" that she had to condemn Russia in her first appearance at the U.N. Security Council, saying \"we do want to better our relations with Russia.\"\nBut Haley said \"the dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions.\"\nShelling over the weekend damaged water, heating and electricity supplies in Avdiivka amid a strong cold snap. Residents' nerves were raw.\n\"I was born in 1941. I was in a war at birth and now I see it again,\" said Valentina Pasternak, as she stood on her porch clutching two loaves of bread brought by aid workers. A shell had landed in her yard.\nBy Thursday, water and heat had been partly restored, but Avdiivka remained without electricity.\nIn Brussels, European Union President Donald Tusk urged Moscow to pressure the separatists to make sure the flare-up of fighting ends and a cease-fire is restored.\n\"Russia should use its influence to disengage the Russia-backed separatists,\" Tusk said.\n___\nNataliya Vasilyeva and Jim Heintz in Moscow, Raf Casert in Valletta, Malta, and Vladimir Isachenkov in Budapest contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:38:10.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
