(Getty) More While the rest of the world reads and weeps, this bot has found a way to profit from Donald Trump’s tweets. And save puppies. The Trump and Dump bot uses software created by ad agency T3 to analyze POTUS’s Twitter activity. If a publicly-traded company is named in a tweet and the algorithm identifies the sentiment as negative, the bot shorts the stock immediately and alerts T3 via web-based messaging app Slack. “Shorting” is the act of borrowing shares and selling them with a view to buying them back once the price of the stock falls. The seller is “short” the shares he sold because he did not own them to begin with. T3 explains Trump and Dump was created using artificial intelligence because human reactions to the tweets would be too slow to capture any monetary benefit. The profits, T3 says, go straight to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The list of stocks Trump’s tweets have affected includes Toyota Motor Corp., General Motors, Lockheed Martin and Rexnord Corp.
