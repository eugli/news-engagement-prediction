And, he promises, \"I won't censor anything.\" \n“It’s running on heavy adrenaline; it’s fun,” he says of his role. “You’re working with the best directors, producers, talent, crew ... but it’s still a little crazy — everyone’s watching!” \nThe six-time Emmy winner was the audio director for the Oscars from 1992 to 1996, and then returned in 2012. He also recently mixed the Super Bowl Halftime Show. \n“We typically start with technical rehearsals on Wednesday and on Thursday go through the acts with stand ins. There are 15 acts,” he said of the Oscar week show preparations.“On Thursday we also brought in [host] Jimmy Kimmel. And on Friday is musical performances. Justin Timberlake (who'll perform this nominated son \"Can't Stop the Music\" from Trolls ) rehearsed in the morning and John Legend (performing \"City of Stars\" and \"Audition\" from La La Land ) after lunch. Saturday is presenter’s day. Every presenter comes in for a run-thru. Sunday is a final rehearsal.” \nSara Bareilles will deliver the “In Memoriam” performance. Sandweiss said of that segment, “People are asked to hold their applause so there’s no favoritism, and that’s usually what happens. If something happens, I don’t try to censor it, so the viewers have the same experience as those in the room.” \n“I wouldn’t censor anything, though that could happen downstream,\" he said of audience reactions during the show as a whole. \"I don’t want to change history.\" Carolyn Giardina ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:05:16.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
