Comments Mohammad Siraj with parents after bagging Rs 2.6 crore in IPL auction | PTI Photo \nNew Delhi, Feb 20: For Mohammed Siraz, the first thing on his mind is to buy a house for his father Mohammed Ghaus and mother Shabana Begum in a good Hyderabad locality. \nAnd why not? The speedster has landed a Rs 2.6 crore deal with Sunrisers Hyderabad, thanks to a brilliant first class season that saw him get India A and Rest of India call-ups. \n“Today, I remember my first income playing cricket. It was a club match and my maternal uncle was the captain of the team. I got nine wickets for 20 odd runs in that 25 over game. My uncle was so happy he gave me Rs 500 as a prize. It was a great feeling. But today when the bid was raised to Rs 2.6 crore, I just went numb,” Siraz told PTI during an interaction from Hyderabad.

He drove auto all these years but never let financial pressure of the family affect me or my elder brother. A bowling spikes costs a lot and he would just get the best for me. I want to buy a house for them now in a good locality,” an emotional Siraz said. \n“My parents have seen hard days. Today my elder brother is a software engineer in a reputed IT firm. I didn’t had interest in studies and my mother would bash me up giving my elder brother’s example. But today she’s on top of the world,” said Siraz.

I had pace but tennis ball cricket teaches you to bowl yorkers. Then I played Hyderabad U-22, Mushtaq Ali, Vijay Hazare and then Ranji Trophy followed by India A. I have taken one step at a time. Next is IPL followed by senior national team,” said Siraz. \nSharing the dressing room with VVS Laxman as mentor and captained by David Warner is a big plus. \n“As a youngster, I would like to learn everything I can. Laxman sir is there and I would get a chance to interact with a player of David Warner’s stature,” concluded Siraz.
