Initially, 925 Twitter staff pulled together a donation of over $530,000. That was then matched by CEO Jack Dorsey and Executive Chairman Omid Kordestani to take the total to $1.59 million, according a company-wide email obtained by TechCrunch. \n‚ÄúOur work is far from done. In the coming months we‚Äôll see a flurry of legal challenges, legislative pushes and public pronouncements. But as long as civil liberties are threatened, I‚Äôm proud to know that as individuals we will stand up to defend freedom and look after people,‚Äù Twitter General Counsel Vijaya Gadde wrote in the memo. Twitter employees donated $530k to the ACLU. @jack and @omidkordestani matched for a total of $1.59 million‚Ä¶ #LoveWhereYouWork \n‚Äî Marie Wagner üêà (@marieewagner) February 2, 2017 \nIt isn‚Äôt just Twitter that is donating to the cause. The ACLU raised over $24 million in donations this past weekend, six-times more than it did in the entirety of 2016, thanks to high-profile pledges from tech companies like Lyft , Google and a range of tech industry figures . In a further sign of support from Silicon Valley, the ACLU entered Y Combinator‚Äôs accelerator program this week where it will receive mentorship and guidance around areas like hiring, the use of technology and more.
