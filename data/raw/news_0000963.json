(Ezra Shaw/Getty Images) \nThere are 25 rookies on the PGA TOUR in 2016-17. This feature provides a subjective ranking updated weekly. The Rookie of the Year is voted by PGA TOUR members who make at least 15 starts. \nSNAPSHOT: Historically, the Farmers Insurance Open is one of those tournaments every season at which rookies aren’t expected to make noise. Torrey Pines’ South Course is always a brute. It’s long and experience matters, especially in a strong field. Usually. \nLo and behold, first-time PGA TOUR member Jon Rahm prevailed in his first try on the course. The 22-year-old from Spain isn’t a rookie, however. As chronicled in this space last summer, he became rookie eligible at the conclusion of the 2016 Wyndham Championship for finishing inside the top 125 in non-member FedExCup points, doing so in just seven starts. \nThat left short-hitting C.T. Pan to scoop low-rookie honors (of 22 in the field). His share of second place (three strokes off Rahm’s pace) is just the fourth top-five finish by a rookie since Rickie Fowler and Alex Prugh posted T5s in 2010. Jhonattan Vegas added a T8 as a rookie the following year. Pan ranked 66th of 73 in distance of all drives for the week. (Only the South Course was lasered for ShotLink purposes.) \nTorrey Pines does have a soft side, however. This was the third straight edition of the tournament in which exactly four rookies finished inside the top 25. If you go back to Fowler in 2010, four of the last seven Rookies of the Year posted a top 25 here. The other three missed the cut: Jordan Spieth (2013), Chesson Hadley (2015), Emiliano Grillo (2016). \nLOW ROOKIE: C.T. Pan, T2. First time. CAREER-BEST FINISHES (AND TIES): C.T. Pan (T2); J.J. Spaun (T9). \n* - In the field at the Waste Management Phoenix Open as of Jan. 29. # - Top-10 alternate at the Waste Management Phoenix Open as of Jan. 29.
