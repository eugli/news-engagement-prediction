JPMorgan declined to comment while Morgan Stanley, and HSBC also could not be immediately reached for comment. \nThe listing of Aramco is expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering and could raise up to $100 billion. The IPO is the centrepiece of the government's ambitious plan, known as Vision 2030, to diversify the economy beyond oil. \nSaudi authorities are aiming to list up to 5 percent of the world's largest oil producer on both the Saudi stock exchange in Riyadh, the Tadawul, and on one or more international markets. \nAramco received proposals from at least six banks for an advisory role on the IPO, sources familiar with the process told Reuters earlier on Tuesday. \nJPMorgan was close to being selected as an underwriter, Reuters reported on Friday, citing a source. Aramco also recently chose boutique investment bank Moelis & Co as an adviser. \nThe IPO plan has been championed by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees the country's energy and economic policies. Last year, he said he expected the IPO would value Aramco at a minimum of $2 trillion, and that the figure might end up being higher. \n(Reporting by Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru; Editing by James Dalgleish and Diane Craft)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:59:12.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
