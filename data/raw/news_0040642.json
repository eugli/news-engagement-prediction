Kodi Nikorima of the Broncos celebrates scoring a try.

I do see myself as a half but that’s Wayne’s call and he’s got his opinion as well.” \nNikorima is the obvious in-house candidate to move into Hunt’s position, despite former captain Justin Hodges last month claiming the 22-year-old isn’t ready for such a responsibility. \nHowever, another former star Scott Prince - who was 21 when be first became a starting Broncos half - said Nikorima deserved an opportunity. \nHe is firming for a spot in Brisbane’s team to face premiers Cronulla on March 2 in the NRL season opener, with recruit Benji Marshall (achilles) fighting to be fit. \n“It’s unfortunate for Benji, but he is expected to be back round one, so there’s a bit of competition there,” he said. \n“He’s a veteran player - he knows his body. I wouldn’t say I’ve got a foot up but I’ll definitely be putting my hand up for that round-one spot.” \nDo you live in Queensland? Want to meet a bunch of NRL legends and talk footy with them?
