Her talk came less than two weeks after someone painted swastikas on a sign and other items outside of Cherokee Elementary School in Paradise Valley.\nSchloss did not know about the racist graffiti when she spoke to The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com last week.\n“I'm not shocked,” she said. “It still happens, all these years later, it still happens.”\nSchloss waited 40 years before speaking about surviving the Holocaust. Once she broke her silence, she found her old memories were reminders for those who did not live through the Nazi regime’s state-sponsored persecution and murder of an estimated 6 million Jews. She has written several books and travels the globe speaking with anyone who will listen.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn The story of Anne Frank   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

He worries about what will happen when the survivors are no longer around to share their memories.\nLevertov said he spoke with families after the swastikas were found at the school. He tried to remind parents that in order to stop hate, they have to do more than just remember the Holocaust.\n\"We feel it's important for our children to realize what Hitler did was terrible,\" he said. \"And for it to never happen again, we need to teach our children to respond with kindness, we need to teach our children strong values, and to stick to their morals, stick to their guns, even when they know it's not popular.\"\nLevertov said that after Paradise Valley officials found out that Schloss was speaking, they chose to issue a proclamation making Monday Holocaust Education Day.\nMayor Michael Collins urged Paradise Valley residents “to recognize the significance of the Holocaust and stand united and committed to teaching the importance of tolerance and understanding for a better and peaceful world.”\nAt 87, Schloss worries about the young people who will carry the burden of fear and hate. She said she looks at the world and wishes her message was less relevant, less needed.\n“The message for youth is obvious, our generation and the previous generations have failed to sort things out,” she said. “It will be their generation, their future, their hope that will be needed to ... create a safe and better world.”\nLast year, Schloss wrote a letter in Newsweek decrying then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's rhetoric about Muslims, refugees and immigrants. She called on others to stand up.\n“The theme of this year’s Holocaust Memorial Day is 'Don’t stand by.' This is particularly important now with the refugee crisis going on as more people than ever are being bystanders,” she wrote. “We haven't really learnt anything — I’m depressed by the current situation.”\nRefugees then and now Dr. Otto Frank holds an award in 1971 for the sale of the famous paperback, \"The Diary of Anne Frank.\"   (Photo: Associated Press) \nSchloss said her stories are a way to remember people murdered during the Holocaust, a way to honor the family she lost and a way to give voice to Frank, the famed diarist who wrote about coming of age as a Jewish girl in Adolf Hitler’s Germany.\nMORE: Researchers unearth link to Anne Frank at Sobibor site \nSchloss met Frank in Amsterdam, where Schloss’ family had fled after the Nazis invaded her home country of Austria in the late 1930s. The girls went to school together. Schloss has written about how chatty and curious Frank was, and about how different she was from Schloss, a tomboy who played sports. She has written about how she lived and Frank died. And about about how Frank's father later became her stepfather.\nAfter the war, Schloss’ mother would marry Anne’s father. The widow and widower knew what it was like to survive loved ones who died in the war.\nAnne Frank was a Jewish teenager forced into hiding in Amsterdam during the Holocaust and killed in a concentration camp.   (Photo: Anne Frank Center/Associated Press) \nLike many desperate Jewish families, Anne’s father, Otto Frank, tried in 1938 and in 1941 to gain refuge in the United States or Cuba. He wrote officials, asking for a visa to bring his wife, Edith, and his daughters, Margot and Anne.\nSchloss said she looks at the Syrian refugee crisis and sees the faces of Jewish children, mothers and fathers who were turned away from the U.S. and other countries during World War II. She sees the face of her stepsister.\nSchloss said she toured the U.S. in 2015 after the film \"No Asylum\" was released . The documentary film chronicled Otto's attempts to gain entry to America.\nIn a 2007 NPR story , Richard Breitman, a professor of German history at American University, said U.S. immigration policies aimed at protecting national security, as well as xenophobia and antisemitism, played a part in Otto and other Jewish families being turned away.\n\"Anne Frank could be a 77-year-old woman living in Boston today — a writer,\" Breitman told NPR.\nOn Holocaust Remembrance Day , the same day Trump issued his executive order temporarily banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries , a St. Louis man created a social-media account to recall people who were turned away at the U.S. border in 1939, and later were killed in the Holocaust. Holocaust Remembrance Day is a time for remembering the people killed under the Nazi regime and an effort dedicated to the prevention of a future genocide.\n'We can't let that happen again' Schloss doesn't need to look at old photos to remember the faces of her father and her brother. She wrote about learning after the war that they died in the prisoner march out of Auschwitz.\n“I lost my father, my brother, and many, many other family members who never had a chance to have a life. That is just something I can’t forget and forgive,” she said. “Countries didn’t want to take any refugees, that’s definitely a failure of the government. We can’t let that happen again.”\nShe said she understands the need for border security, but she does not understand how there can be no compromise to save the lives of Syrian and other refugees escaping war. Trump and his supporters have argued that the executive order would help alleviate security concerns and fight terrorism.\nShe thinks about the world children live in today.\n“There’s still racism, prejudice and bullying, especially for kids in schools,” she said. “There’s still all kinds of wars, refugee problems.”\nShe thinks about the refugee families who are being turned away today. She knows that some will die.\nSchloss remembers the question from the student at the assembly last week: How did you not give up? \nEven amid genocide, war and hate, she didn't want to die.\n“I was 15 and I wanted to live,” she said.\nSchloss will turn 88 this year. She'll keep speaking, as long as anyone will listen.\nMORE: Anne Frank may not have been betrayed \nA facsimile of Anne Frank's diary displayed during a press conference at Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Thursday, June 11, 2009.
