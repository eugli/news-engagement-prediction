But it turns out there's now such thing as a jacket that might just make flying suck less, by allowing you to store all of you crap inside of it instead of a suitcase. It's called the Airport Jacket and if its $76,000 Kickstarter campaign is successful when it ends in April, you might be able to save a little on baggage fees by literally carrying your carry-on on you. The jacket can be worn three different ways, can hold up to 33lbs of your stuff, and comes with a carrying bag. Specifically, its 14 \"deep\" pockets and two detachable pockets are designed to hold stuff like a laptop, an iPad, two pairs of shoes, a pair of jeans, three t-shirts, two pairs of shorts, several pairs of underwear, a light sweater, a dress, a liquids bag, a wallet, a phone, a passport, and more, according to the Kickstarter description. As you can see in a video of the product (shown above), it appears to do all of that while not looking too bulky. Kickstarter Basically, it's a fairly decent-looking jacket with some of the utility of a backpack, and it's allegedly useful if you're willing to pay about $180 for one and maybe part with a bit of your dignity. Of course, a jacket with a crapload of pockets isn't exactly a revolutionary concept, but there's a chance it could prove useful for at least some travelers who need to pack light.
