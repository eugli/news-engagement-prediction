Over the next 50 years, this idea could save the taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in interest expenses.\nRepublicans face angry protests at town halls (3:09) Republican lawmakers are confronting a wave of activism at town halls and public events across the country, as crowds of protesters express their anger over the Trump administration’s policies.

It was in that same interview last year that Trump shocked financial markets with his off-the-cuff suggestion that maybe the government should threaten to just walk away from its debts as a way to negotiate with bondholders for a better deal, the way Trump had done so often with his hotels and casinos.\nTo be clear, Mnuchin’s idea for selling 50-year or even 100-year bonds would not be a repudiation of existing debt. He’s asked the Bureau of the Public Debt to look into selling some new debt with longer maturities, not unilaterally extending the maturity of existing bonds or notes.\nCurrently, the average maturity of federal debt held by the public is 63 months. In other words, nearly half of the debt rolls over in the next five years. More than $3.3 trillion rolls over in the next year. Only a little over $1 trillion matures after 2027.\nAs of January, the government was paying an average of 2% interest annually, down from 4.9% in 2007.\nIf interest rates rise, as most expect, the cost of servicing that debt would also rise. In fiscal 2016, the federal government paid $233 billion in net interest costs, but that figure is expected to rise to $787 billion in 2026 under the assumption that the yield on the 10-year note will rise from 2.39% now to 4%.\nSelling some debt for a longer period would lock in today’s low rates for the next 50 or 100 years. Homeowners, businesses and state and local governments have taken advantage of the current low-rate environment to refinance their debt and lock in these rates, but the federal government really hasn’t.\nThe Treasury could issue more long-term debt to extend the average maturity, but it has held back on the advice of the Treasury’s Borrowing Advisory Committee , which is composed of the big Wall Street firms that operate the bond market, buying from the Treasury and selling to the public.\nThe Treasury says it listens carefully to the bond market when it decides on the mix of the maturities it offers, because preserving a liquid and orderly bond market keeps costs low for taxpayers.\nHaving a liquid market is valuable, but the market is telling other bond issuers that it wants lots more long-term debt. The Treasury should sell more 30-year bonds, and even 50-year or 100-year bonds to meet that demand.\nIreland, Belgium and Mexico have recently sold 100-year bonds. Ford F, -0.39% Disney DIS, -0.20% and Coca-Cola KO, +0.78% have sold 100-year bonds as well. The Canadian Pacific Corp. sold a 1,000-year bond.\nAnd many governments, such as the U.K., have issued bonds that have no maturity date at all: Called perpetuals or consols, these bonds continue paying a coupon year-after-year until the principal is redeemed. The U.K. recently redeemed the consols that had financed its earlier wars against Napoleon and the kaiser.\nWho buys these long bonds? Mostly pension funds and insurance companies that want to match the maturities of their assets and their liabilities. The U.S. government should also think about issuing more long-term bonds to match the timing of future Social Security and Medicare payments.\nKudos to Mnuchin and Trump for thinking of the taxpayer first.\nMore from MarketWatch Here's Why Your Car Insurance Rates Are Spiking Exploring the Last Frank Lloyd Wright Homes in Their Original Owners' Hands Disney Cuts Ties to YouTube Superstar PewDiePie", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-05-16/memo-to-trump-u-s-debt-shall-not-be-questioned", "https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/quarterly-refunding/Pages/members-index.aspx"], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:05:23.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
