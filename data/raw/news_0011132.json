It was so hard for us to pick ourselves up and be positive after all the bad news.

Read More \n“During her battle with cancer she has raised more than £4,000 for cancer charities. \n“Mum is always helping others and I wanted to try and help her by giving something back. \n“This might be able to save her life and I know she would never be able to thank you all enough for that.” \nTo donate to Sandra’s appeal, visit HERE . \nBreast screening is currently offered to women aged 50-70 in England. However, the NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47-73.
