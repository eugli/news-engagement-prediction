She said it goes on a lot more often than what gets posted on social media. Two weeks after the video of a high school bullying incident went viral, Nelly Price is speaking-out for #PinkShirtDay @Global_NB pic.twitter.com/4nAVbLCma5 \n— Adrienne South (@AdrienneKS) February 22, 2017 \n“There’s always videos posted on Facebook about bullying, but it doesn’t really get out much,” Price said. “I feel like this (video) since it happens in a local area that it’s something people are aware of. I’m pretty sure it might have helped raise more awareness for bullying,” Price said. \nPrice said it’s important to be kind to one another. \nREAD MORE: Stand up against bullying: Today is Pink Shirt Day \nClinical social worker and Northside Counselling Services owner Vicki Coy said the incident was “unfortunate and tragic,” but she said it does show how frequent bullying occurs in schools, workplaces and communities. \n“I think if you see somebody saying something that’s nasty to call them on it, to ask them to change their words, to stop the gossip to chose for yourself to not be mean, to say negative things,” Coy said. \nREAD MORE: Alberta raising awareness of bullying impact on Pink Shirt Day \nCoy said the pink shirt is a reminder for everyone to be kind, but said it’s something people need to remember every day – not just Feb. 22. \nPrice said bystanders need to realize the role they can play in helping end bullying. She said people need to “build up the guts to step in and help rather than standing around videoing it and watching their friend, or someone that they know get hurt.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
