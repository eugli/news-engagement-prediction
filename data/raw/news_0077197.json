Cold Lake is the busiest fighter base in the country and provides fighter pilot training for all Canadian Forces pilots. \nAt least 10 pilots have died in crashes of CF-18s since the military bought 138 of the jets for $5 billion in 1980. \nREAD MORE: Pilot killed in CF-18 crash identified as 10-year veteran Capt. Thomas McQueen \nMcQueen had been with the Air Force for a decade and served in missions in eastern Europe and Iraq. \nHis family said he died doing what he loved. In a statement following his death , they said McQueen grew up on a farm near Hamilton and was engaged to be married. \nHe used to draw jets on his homework and “never wavered in his desire to be a fighter pilot,” said the family. \nWatch below: Sister of Captain Thomas McQueen remembers her ‘first best friend’ \n“Thomas loved speed, whether it was on a boat, his dirt bike, or breaking the sound barrier in his jet,” the family said. \n“He loved everyone and always took care of others before himself. Thomas touched the lives of so many people, and he will be deeply missed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:16:25.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
