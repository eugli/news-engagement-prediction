On Monday night, the superstar hosted a party to celebrate the film's success at a suburban five-star hotel in Mumbai.\nAmitabh Bachchan congratulates Shah Rukh Khan for ‘Raees’ performance Shah Rukh Khan has been wooing fans the world over with his performance in ‘Raees’, and it now looks like the Badshah has also found a fan in Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan.\nDuring the media interaction, SRK was understandably asked the much anticipated question on competition with the other Khans - Aamir and Salman . Shah Rukh said, \"Every film has its own destiny. You can't compare or equate two movies.\nHaving said that, at this point, we are very happy because 'Raees' has surpassed our expectations - collections and figures notwithstanding. It's nice to know that everything is going well. If I start comparing 'Raees' to other films, then sky is the limit. And why should we compare a film only with the last big hits (sic)? 'Dangal' and 'Sultan' are much huger hits than perhaps this film will ever be.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/qWt90szFIhU"], "published": "2017-01-31T10:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:45:25.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
