Researchers say it’s also getting gradually deeper.\nBut a study in the science journal Quarternary Research says that, along with its ominous release of green house gas, the stratified layers of the crater’s sides are releasing immense historical climate data.\nA remnant of an ancient tree uncovered by the opening of Batagaika crater in Yakutian, Siberia.

But there are also two prominent bands of tree stumps, showing the land was covered in dense forest.\nAmong it all are the remains of ancient mammoth, musk ox and even a 4400 year-old horse.\nPut together it’s all painting a picture of past gradual changes in climate over the course of tens of thousands of years. Researchers hope it will help them predict what will happen in coming decades.\nLocals call this fast-growing crater a \"doorway to the underworld\". Prof Julian Murton's new study finds out more. https://t.co/eTmsKM6sbl \n— University of Sussex (@SussexUni) February 27, 2017 University of Sussex professor of permafrost science Julian Murton says the last time Siberia appears to have experienced the formation of ‘hellsmouth’ craters was 10,000 years ago — when the Earth woke from the last ice age.\nOne forest-bed remnant sits above an even older landscape that had been heavily eroded. “This was probably when permafrost thawed in a past episode of climate warming,” Murton said.\nBut greenhouse gas levels in our atmosphere are much her now than then. Current figures place the saturation level at 400 parts per million of CO2. Back then, it was 280 parts per million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:09:13.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
