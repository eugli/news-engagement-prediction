The programme will blend nostalgia with innovation - expect very special things!” Read More Manchester Food and Drink Festival in Albert Square \nThe 2017 festival will take over the city from September 28 to October 9. \nAlbert Square will be home to the festival hub again, while restaurants, bars and other venues across the city will also be getting involved to stage a huge programme of food and drink events. \nThe festival will culminate in the MFDF Gala Dinner and Awards Ceremony on October 9, which recognises the best of the city's hospitality industry. \nThe full programme of events will be announced from March onwards.
