Michelle is catching more than a few side-eyes over her congratulatory message to Beyonce, who announced Wednesday she is pregnant with twins. \nThe “Ain’t You” singer is being accused of trying to steal Bey’s shine while suggesting the megastar used in vitro fertilization to conceive. \n\nSoon after Beyonce made her pregnancy announcement, K. Michelle reposted her maternity photo and congratulated the 35-year-old mom. \nA photo posted by K. Michelle (@kmichellemusic) on Feb 1, 2017 at 11:23am PST \n“Yesss! The season of the multiples! I can’t wait to hit this doctor next month Congrats. I know it's an awesome feeling! I can't wait to see the doctor next month. No, I’m not pregnant. Not yet guys, I need to see a doctor 1st right.” \nA photo posted by K. Michelle (@kmichellemusic) on Jan 31, 2017 at 10:39pm PST \nMany fans took the line “can’t wait to hit this doctor next month” as a slick way of accusing Queen Bey of having used IFV to conceive twins, something K. Michelle has expressed interest in on her show, K. Michelle: My Life. \n\nOthers simply thought she was attempting to steal Bey’s shine by saying she’ll be pregnant soon as well, making the post about herself instead of the superstar she’s congratulating. \nA photo posted by Beyonc (@beylite) on Feb 2, 2017 at 4:30am PST \nWhile it’s possible there could be a drop of shade when reading between the lines, K. Michelle has expressed several times how much of an inspiration Beyonce has been for her. \nHer own previously stated desire to have twins also leads us to believe she’s being sincere. \n\nDo you believe K. Michelle was throwing shade? Sound off below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:34:56.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
