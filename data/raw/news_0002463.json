Since fleeing to Germany, she has travelled the world raising awareness of the plight of Yazidi women enslaved by ISIS.\nSpeaking to STV News on a visit to Scotland, where she met First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, she said: 'They took children to training camps and they were killing many others, telling us we would be enslaved.\n'We didn't feel valued as humans in their hands. They enslaved more than 6,500 females they took them to different places.\nScroll down for video\nSince her escape three months after being enslaved by ISIS thugs, she has spoken at the UN to highlight the plight of Yadizi women\n'They did what they want to the women and my fate was the same. I was one of the victims and they did everything to us.'\nAnd recounting the horrific treatment she suffered, Nadia said: 'They separated any woman over nine years old and were enslaving them they forced us to change our religion and they did everything they wanted to us.\n'We were subjected to crimes to their hands that nobody can mention what they did for us.'\nShe saw young girls being traded as sex slaves, and was raped and tortured on a daily basis.\nInternational lawyer Amal Clooney (left) is fighting to bring ISIS to the International Criminal Court\nNadia, who has addressed the UN General Assembly, said the Yazidi people captured by ISIS were told they could convert to Islam or be executed, but young girls and women were selected for horrific abuse.\nYoung girls and women were also taken by extremists as sex slaves.\nShe and her two sisters were enslaved, but her mother was executed as she was considered 'too old'.\nThe activist has called for world leaders to do more to help victims of religious persecution, and hit out at Donald Trump over his controversial border control measures.\nNadia said: 'In general world leaders are supposed to know there are many people who need protection.\n'This is something real and this is happening for more than 3500 females - they are being subjected to more than what I have been subjected to.\n'I know what is happening to them and every minute I am thinking about them.\n'Donald Trump should know religious minorities are persecuted everywhere. He should not close his borders to those who need help.'", "external_links": ["https://stv.tv/news/features/1379541-woman-kept-as-slave-by-isis-tells-nicola-sturgeon-of-persecution/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-03T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:13:27.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
