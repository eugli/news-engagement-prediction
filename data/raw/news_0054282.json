his career spanned from the Dallas Cowboys to Hollywood and more Filed under Obituaries at Get   \nGary Cartwright, a colorful Texas journalist who began his career on the talent-laden sports staff of the Fort Worth Press in the 1950s, died Wednesday morning after suffering a recent fall at his Austin home. He was 82. \nCartwright went on to become an award-winning sportswriter for the Dallas Times Herald and The Dallas Morning News . He left the News in 1967 to advance a career that included writing the 1982 novel The Hundred Yard War , inspired by his coverage of the Dallas Cowboys. \nBut his most prominent years as a journalist came during his time with Texas Monthly . He worked for the Austin-based magazine from 1973, when he profiled controversial Cowboys running back Duane Thomas for its debut issue, to 2010, when he retired. \nHis credentials include multiple works of nonfiction, most based on stories for the Monthly , and credits on four Hollywood screenplays . \nKatelyn Cartwright, the writer's granddaughter, and journalist Jan Reid, one of his closest friends, confirmed Cartwright's death Wednesday morning. \n\"He was certainly one of a kind,\" acclaimed Texas author Dan Jenkins, 88, said of Cartwright, with whom he worked at the Press and the Times Herald . \"He was a wild card, but he was awfully talented. We had a million laughs.\" \nCartwright, Jenkins and mutual friend Edwin \"Bud\" Shrake collaborated on what may have been the most audacious, literary-minded sports staff ever assembled. All three worked at the Press and Times Herald , where their boss was an equally vivid character, the late Blackie Sherrod, who later became a columnist for the News . \nCartwright was well-read, Jenkins said, \"and he was a fan of the trade, as we all were. It just came natural to him. We were all kind of natural, for some strange reason. It was just one of those things. We all fell together. Blackie had an awful lot to do with making us work hard. \n\"We laughed a lot, we joked a lot, and we kind of wrote for each other and tried to out-write each other. It was fun, and we were all friends.\" \nJenkins, who now lives in his native Fort Worth, said: \"I figured it up one day. Blackie and Bud and Gary and I, the four of us, combined to have 57 books published. For a little sports staff, that may be a world record.\" \nCartwright came of age as a journalist in the 1960s, which coincided with a memorable era in Dallas sports. The decade began with not one but two professional football teams playing in the Cotton Bowl. \nIt was a time of raw turbulence in the country but especially in Dallas, where President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, when Cartwright was the Cowboys beat writer for the News and Shrake was its lead sports columnist. The two covered the Cowboys game in Cleveland two days after the assassination, a Sunday in which a man they knew -- strip-club owner Jack Ruby -- gunned down lead suspect Lee Harvey Oswald in the basement of the Dallas police station. Cowboys had to repair Dallas’ image after JFK assassination \nIn 2011, Cartwright gave an oral history of his memories of Dallas, circa 1963, to The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza. \n\"Dallas was ... Someone called it a 'city of hate' after the assassination, and that was a good description of it,\" Cartwright says in the oral history. \"It brimmed over with hatred and mistrust and with anti-government rhetoric. Everyone assumed that the government was Communist, and Dallas politics were far right-wing politics. There was a small group of people -- I knew most of \"em [chuckling] -- who voted Democratic, and everybody else was Republican.\" \nBy the time of the oral history, Cartwright was known widely as a consummate profile writer. His subjects included such Texas characters as nude dancer Candy Barr and Ruby. \n\"In those days, Gary and Bud were very much a part of that more colorful side of Dallas, associating with folks like Jack Ruby and his dancers ... That all became the stuff of local legend,\" said Stephen Fagin, the museum's curator, who interviewed Cartwright for the oral history. \nRuby, Cartwright told Fagin, \"liked sportswriters. He liked all the newspapermen, but he particularly liked sportswriters.\" Bud Shrake (right) and Gary Cartwright, dressed as \"Flying Punzars,\" wake Ann Richards early one Sunday morning. \nDoatsy Shrake / Courtesy Doatsy Shrake from The Best I Recall, 2015 by Gary Cartwright, published by the University of Texas Press. \nHe gave them free tickets to his club, Cartwright said, and introduced them to strippers. That led to Shrake dating Janet Conforto, better known as Jada, the star dancer in Ruby's club. Shrake died in 2009, but at the time of her death in 2006, Shrake's companion for years had been former Texas Gov. Ann Richards. \nIn the oral history, Cartwright calls Ruby \"a thug. He was a gangster. He carried a gun and let everybody know he carried a gun. Kind of a little guy, stocky, always wore a dark suit and a snap-brim hat. Always was feisty.\" The Best I Recall, by Gary Cartwright \nCartwright reminisces further about 1963 Dallas in his 2015 memoir, The Best I Recall , a not entirely happy account in which he confesses, candidly, to more than one instance of domestic abuse. He was married four times but lived alone at the time of his death. \nKatelyn Cartwright, 29, says her grandfather fell in his home on Valentine's Day and remained on the floor for four days before a neighbor found him and rushed him to the hospital, where he died in the hospice unit at 6 a.m. Wednesday. Cartwright had three children, six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. \n\"He lived alone with his little mutt dog, Zack, whom he loved,\" Catelyn says, adding, \"From a young age, I knew he was a legend, someone important.\" \nHe also had a nickname, a politically incorrect moniker given to him by colleagues who felt he resembled the Japanese warriors in World War II movies. His closest friends and family members called him by the nickname. Memoir review: ‘The Best I Recall,’ by Gary Cartwright \nKatelyn called him \"Pappy,\" followed by the nickname. \"At the time, I didn't know that that was derogatory,\" she says, \"because that was just my granddaddy. But he was a legend, and I am forever learning about all his adventures. But there's not a thing that would surprise me.\" \nBy the time he retired from the Monthly six years ago, Cartwright had carved out a preeminent reputation for expertly crafting long-form narratives about dozens of subjects, most dealing with grisly crimes. He covered the shocking Fort Worth case of millionaire oilman Cullen Davis, who was charged with shooting his estranged wife, Priscilla, and murdering her ex-lover, Stan Farr, and her teenage daughter, Andrea. \nThat led to the book, Blood Will Tell , which became a four-part television movie. \nReid, who began writing for Texas Monthly in May 1973, said that Cartwright, his long-time friend, always remained \"the leader of the pack.\" \n\"Even though a number of us came in with a lot of ego and ambition, you could look around the room, and we were all 26 and 27, and we didn't know what we were doing,\" Reid said. \"He was like 10 years older, and he had already established himself. From the very first issue of the magazine, he was the leader of the pack. As the years wore on, even as others moved on -- Stephen Harrigan, Al Reinart, William Broyles, the first editor who became a great screenwriter, etc., etc. -- Gary remained the foundation of the magazine until he left. \n\"What an incredible influence he was -- and a friend. He was never distant. Egotistical and ambitious, the rest of us thought we knew what we were doing, but the guy we looked to was Cartwright, because he did know what he was doing.\" Gary Cartwright as a sophomore at Arlington High, 1948. From\"The Best I Recall, 2015 by Gary Cartwright, published by the University of Texas Press \nIn his often painful-to-read memoir -- which a critic for the Austin American-Statesman said \"includes a sizeable amount of rather frank information about his rough-and-tumble private life\" -- Cartwright chronicles his early life in West Texas, his teen years in Arlington and his Army years after the Korean War. \nHis memoir fleshes out one of his most compelling stories, involving the murder of \"flamboyant El Paso attorney Lee Chagra,\" which became, in his words, \"the foundation of a far more complicated case that involved the murder-for-hire of federal judge John Wood.\" \nThat story led to the book \"Dirty Dealing.\" It, too, inspired a movie. \nCartwright recently won mention on the national radio show, Snap Judgment , which aired on many National Public Radio affiliates, including KERA-FM (90.1) , for his profile on private detective Jay J. Armes that began as a story for the Monthly . \nHe also covered the case of Texas Death Row inmate Randall Dale Adams, who was framed for a Dallas murder he didn't commit and who inspired the 1988 Errol Morris documentary, The Thin Blue Line . \nBut one of the most talked-about moments in Cartwright's career came after a bitter Cowboys defeat. The lead to his game story published in the News remains a staple of sportswriting folklore. Don Meredith (left) and Gary Cartwright: \"Though they became good friends, Gary sometimes wrote caustic reviews of his performance mostly.\" From The Best I Recall , 2015 by Gary Cartwright, published by the University of Texas Press. Dallas Morning News \nOn Nov. 21, 1965, the Cowboys were playing the defending champs of the National Football League, the Cleveland Browns, led by Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown. In their sixth year of existence, the woeful Cowboys had yet to experience a winning season. But on Thanksgiving Day 1965, they teetered on the threshold of a turning point. \nDon Meredith, the team's often-embattled quarterback, had marched the Cowboys to the Browns' 1-yard-line, with 4 minutes 34 seconds remaining and the Browns ahead, 24-17. The cacophonous crowd of 76,251 was, at the time, the largest in Cotton Bowl history. \nBut, sadly, the comeback unraveled. \nRather than have the Cowboys run the ball, Meredith hurled a wobbly first-down pass, which caromed into the arms of a Cleveland defender. \nHunched in the press box on deadline, Cartwright crafted a lead that serves as a lasting parody of turn-of-the-20th century sports-writing legend Grantland Rice: \n\"Outlined against a gray November sky, the Four Horsemen rode again. You know them: Pestilence, Death, Famine and Meredith.\" \nThat, Dan Jenkins said, \"was one of the greatest leads ever.\" \nSam Blair, a retired sports columnist for the News , once wrote a piece in which he quoted Cartwright, his longtime friend, expressing regret about something else he wrote of Meredith: \"In a column I said Meredith was a loser. That was stupid. Meredith wasn't a loser. I was.\" \nBorn in West Texas, Cartwright grew up in Arlington and graduated from Arlington High School and Texas Christian University. He began his career as a police reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram before defecting to the rival Press , where he and Shrake began to leave a lasting impression. \n\"They were the real gonzo journalists,\" said Austin-based musician John Inmon, who met Cartwright, Shrake and one of their high-profile running buddies, Dallas Cowboy turned novelist Pete Gent ( North Dallas Forty ), when Inmon was the lead guitarist for Jerry Jeff Walker in his backing ensemble, the Lost Gonzo Band. Until his death, Cartwright and Walker remained friends. \nCartwright and Shrake \"lived that lifestyle,\" Inmon said. \"They were real journalists in the old-fashioned newspaper sense of it.\" Some call it New Journalism, an approach they shared, Inmon said, with the king of Gonzo, the late Hunter S. Thompson, who also began as a sportswriter. \nHowever unconventional or circuitous the path, Cartwright landed the prestigious Dobie-Paisano fellowship, given by the University of Texas. He won the Texas Institute of Letters Stanley Walker Award for journalism and the Carr P. Collins Award for nonfiction. He won the 1989 Press Club of Dallas Katie Award for Best Magazine News Story. He won the 2005 Headliner Club of Austin award for best magazine story. In addition to Blood Will Tell , Dirty Dealing and The Hundred Yard War , Cartwright's books include Confessions of a Washed-up Sportswriter , Heart Wiseguy: How to Live the Good Life After a Heart Attack and Galveston: A History of the Island . \nHe co-wrote the movie scripts J. W. Coop (Columbia, 1972); A Pair of Aces (CBS-TV, 1990), which he also co-produced; and Pancho, Billy and Esmerelda, which he co-produced for his own production company in 1994. In addition, he co-produced Another Pair of Aces for CBS. \nFuneral arrangements are pending. \nTwitter: @mgranberry \nThis is a YouTube video that features Cartwright talking about one of his book subjects, the island of Galveston: View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:56:32.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
