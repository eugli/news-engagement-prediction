Two Saudi sailors were killed and three were wounded in the attack.\n \nTwo Defense Department officials told Fox News the attack may have been meant for an American warship, or was a practice run for a similar attack against an American warship.\n“President Trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between Iran and the Obama Administration, as well as the United Nations, as being weak and ineffective,” Flynn said. “Instead of being thankful to the United States for these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened.”\nFlynn refrained from elaborating on whether the U.S. would take action beyond a verbal warning.\nSenior administration officials said Wednesday they are still in the early stages of determining what action the U.S. should take in response to Iran’s highly provocative behavior.\n  Trump Honors Scalia’s Widow As He Nominates Scalia’s Successor After Suspension For Attacking Conway, Philly Anchor Makes Another Inappropriate Comment Trump Cancels Signing Of Cybersecurity Executive Order “We are considering a whole range of options. We’re in a deliberative process,” one official said.\nThe National Iranian American Council repudiated Flynn’s threat.\n“Michael Flynn’s statement on Iran today was reckless,” said Trita Parsi of the NIAC in a statement . “While Flynn’s remarks could be construed as simply bluster, they will beget an Iranian response which in turn will beget further threats by the U.S. At some point, this escalatory cycle that started with bluster may end in war.”\nWhat do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:55:52.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
