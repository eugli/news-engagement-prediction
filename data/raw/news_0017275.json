Jim Jordan (Ohio) suggested Tuesday morning that the media try to “undermine” President Donald Trump.\nOn CNN’s “New Day” Tuesday morning, host Christ Cuomo asked Jordan if Trump is correct in blaming the media for supposedly “underreport[ing] terror attacks.”\n“I’ll take your word for it that you didn’t underreport, that you actually reported some of those,” Jordan said. “But I do think, does the media have a bias? Is the media out to make sure they can undermine some of the things the president is doing? I think that’s pretty clear.”\nTrump accused the media Moday of deliberately ignoring terrorist attacks across the world.\n“It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported,” Trump told military leaders at U.S. Central Command Monday. “And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.”\nLater Monday, the White House released a list of 78 terrorist attacks planned or carried out by Islamic State supporters across the world that it claimed “have not received the media attention they deserved.” The list, which covered attacks from September 2014 to December 2016, included the Paris truck attack and the shootings in San Bernardino, California , and Orlando, Florida — attacks that were widely covered in the media.\nNBC reported Tuesday that a look through its archives show that the news network covered 57 of the attacks on the White House’s list. The 21 attacks not covered by NBC were smaller incidents that resulted in the deaths of only eight people total, according to NBC. Additionally, in many of those attacks, the suspects were detailed as “unidentified” or “unidentified ISIL” operatives.\nRepublican Rep. @Jim_Jordan : The media is out to undermine President Trump https://t.co/kb5S1lNHXf \n— New Day (@NewDay) February 7, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T18:12:18.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
