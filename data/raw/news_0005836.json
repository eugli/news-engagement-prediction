ROB KITCHIN / FAIRFAX NZ \nPrime Minister Bill English announces the date of the 2017 General Election. \nHe said National would campaign on its strong record in government, with its handling of the economy at centre stage. \nREAD MORE: \n\"New Zealand is well placed compared to many other countries. That's down to the hard work of households and businesses across the country, backed by the National-led Government's clear and successful plan for our future. Murray Wilson/ Fairfax NZ. \nLabour leader Andrew Little says his party will campaign on restoring \"the Kiwi dream\". \n\"The challenge for our country now is to sustain that growth and build on it to deliver more again for all New Zealanders.\" \nAsked to sum up the election in one word, English replied, \"Growth\". \nHe believed it was unlikely immigration would be a major issue at the election, with all forecasts indicating there would be a slowdown in the number of immigrants arriving. \nEnglish said National's preference was to work with its current partners - UnitedFuture, ACT, and the Maori Party. Ad Feedback \nHe ruled out any deal with Labour or the Greens but said a coalition with NZ First was a possibility, despite calling them an \"unlikely partner\". \nWhile describing Winston Peters' party as \"an inward-looking party who believe in a closed-up New Zealand\", English would not \"rule in or out\" choosing Peters as deputy prime minister. Murray Wilson/ Fairfax NZ. \nNZ First leader Winston Peters has reacted nonchalantly to news of the election date, saying \"it suits us just fine\". \nAsked whether deals with ACT leader David Seymour and UnitedFuture leader Peter Dunne in their respective Epsom and Ohariu electorates would continue, he said discussions were still ongoing but it was unlikely that would change. \n\"I think you could expect existing arrangements that have worked would continue to underpin a stable National-led government.\" \n\"Good policy and a general election\" would get National voters to the polls, improving on the party's poor performance in recent by-elections, English said. \nLabour leader Andrew Little said the party was \"ready and raring to go so we can change the Government and build a better New Zealand\". \n\"We're well prepared, our teams are in place, our plans are well advanced and we'll be working hard to convince New Zealanders we can help give them a fair shot at the Kiwi dream.\" \nLittle said the party's priorities would be the housing crisis, improving access to healthcare, and \"building the world-class education system parents expect for their kids\". \nNZ First leader Winston Peters said the election date \"suits us fine\", while Green Party co-leader James Shaw said his party was \"more energised and more prepared than we've ever been\". - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:34:04.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
