Carter was not disqualified from those meets like he was the 2008 Beijing Games. \nBolt said he had no fear or worry about the possibility of having to return more relay gold medals. \n\"Even if I lose all my relay gold medals, for me, I did what I had to do, my personal goals,\" Bolt said in the CNN interview that appeared to take place two weeks ago in Monaco. \"That's what counts.\" Close Bolt cruises to victory in 150m UP NEXT VIDEO Bolt cruises to victory in 150m.
