It's been embarrassing,\" the Danish goalkeeper told a television reporter after Leicester's 3-0 defeat at home to Manchester United on Sunday. \n\"It's time for every single one of us, right from the top to the bottom of this club, to stand up and be counted because if we don't, we're going to end up getting relegated.\" \nA year on from a stunning 3-1 win at Manchester City that sent them five points clear at the league summit, the loss to United left Claudio Ranieri's men a solitary point above the relegation zone. \nJust nine months after the dizzy climax to their 5,000-1 title triumph, Leicester face the prospect of becoming England's first defending champions to be relegated since Manchester City in 1938. \nBeaten only three times last season, they have lost 13 times already this term -- losing their last four league games without scoring a goal -- and are still to win a single game away from home.
