London: Baloch & Sindhi activists protest against CPEC, China & Pakistan, outside Chinese Embassy pic.twitter.com/i7slKF2KnI \nâ€” ANI (@ANI_news) February 22, 2017 \nThe protesters were carrying banners saying \"China Hands-off Balochistan\", \"Stop Baloch Genocide\" and \"No to CPEC\". \nPeople across Pakistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) are raising concerns over 51.5 billion dollar China-led, multi-layered infrastructure project, which aims to connect Kashgar, in China's western province of Xinjiang, with the port of Gwadar in the Pakistani province of Balochistan. \nThe road and rail network under the project traverses through Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh, before terminating in Balochictan. \nThough touted by the Pakistan government as a `game changer' there has been a rel-ntless wave of opposition to the project from the local population in many parts of the country. \nSome of the key project of the CPEC are being undertaken in Balochistan. Chief among them is the development of the Gwadar Port. \nHowever, as China accelerates work on the port project and other aspects of the CPEC, opposition among the local people against them is mounting. \nBaloch nationalist groups in the province, who have for years been demanding independence and have frequently clashed with the Pakistani army and establishment, have also called the opposition of the project. \nPeople in the resource-rich province strongly believe that the CPEC will only result in the economic exploitation of Balochistan, with the people being reduced to a minority in their own land. \n(With ANI inputs) First Published: Wednesday, February 22, 2017 - 09:13 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:50:04.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
