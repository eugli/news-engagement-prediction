No decision was made on South Ledge. \nIn Genting Highlands , MCA president Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said the party supported the Government’s move to challenge the ICJ judgment. \nLiow said Malaysians had hoped to see the islands returned to the country. \n“New proof is coming in to show that Pulau Batu Puteh belongs to Malaysia and we want to claim back our island,” he told reporters after attending a Chinese New Year open house. \nIt was hosted by Genting Group chairman and chief executive Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay at the Genting International Convention Centre here yesterday. \nLast Friday, Attorney-General Tan Sri Mohamed Apandi Ali said in a statement that Malaysia filed an application to revise the ICJ’s judgment over the three islands. \nRelated story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:04:50.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
