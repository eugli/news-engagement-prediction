Cooksey filed the lawsuit in response to a note that Ocean posted last summer on his Tumblr in the aftermath of the Orlando nightclub shooting. “I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a faggot as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty,” the note reads. It continues, “That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t.” \nAccording to Cooksey, the story is untrue, and has “damaged his financial opportunities in film and music.” He’s suing his son for $14.5 million in damages. In 2014, Cooksey sued Russell Simmons for nearly ten times that amount, also over defamation charges. Pitchfork has reached out to representatives for Ocean for comment.
