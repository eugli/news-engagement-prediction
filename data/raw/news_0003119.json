(Photo: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports) \nSteph Curry's dad, Dell Curry, became one of the highlights of the night on Wednesday. \nSteph tossed a basketball toward Dell, who played in the NBA for 16 years. Without skipping a beat - and in a suit - Dell grabbed the ball, took a step toward the basket and let it fly. Steph... to DELL... for THREE!! pic.twitter.com/1W9lroCF4O â€” CSN Warriors News (@CSNWarriors) February 2, 2017 \nAfter it banked in, both father and son laughed, while Dell shrugged, and Steph pumped his fist. \nDell shot 40.2 percent from deep overall in his career. So far, Steph is shooting 44 percent from beyond the arc. Plus, Seth Curry, the other Curry currently in the league who hasn't launched as many shots as Steph or Dell (yet), is shooting 43.2 percent from the 3-point line. Not bad. \nIf you'd like to see Dell and Steph face off, last year the two played H.O.R.S.E. for a GQ video that you can watch here .
