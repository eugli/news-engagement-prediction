(AP Photo/Sam Craft) Contact SportsDayDFW.com on Twitter: @SportsDayDFW \nThe Dallas Cowboys desperately need to upgrade their pass rush. \nTexas A&M star defensive end Myles Garrett, a former Arlington Martin star, apparently would love to play for America's Team. Texas A&M DE Myles Garrett explains why he won't attend NFL draft \nIn a video on ESPN, Garrett sent a message to Cowboys owner Jerry Jones : \"I'm speaking to you, Jerry. Mr. (Jason) Garrett, make it happen. Dak Prescott is leading our team right now. I need you to take Tony Romo, take a couple of picks and give 'em to Cleveland so you can pick me up. I'd love to play in Dallas. Just make it happen.\" \nA match made in heaven? \nIt would be. The only trouble is the Cowboys hold the 28th pick in the first round of the 2017 NFL draft. Garrett has been projected by many experts to be the top overall pick. The Cleveland Browns hold that pick. \nThe Cowboys would be hard-pressed to put together a package enticing enough to move up that far in the first round. \nBesides, the Cowboys made out pretty well several years ago when they passed on the temptation to draft a highly visible Texas A&M star in the first round. \nYou probably remember Johnny Manziel. Jerry Jones listened to the other voices in the draft war room, and the Cowboys selected star Notre Dame offensive lineman Zack Martin instead. \nBut that doesn't mean the Cowboys won't be looking at Aggies early in the draft.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:17:06.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
