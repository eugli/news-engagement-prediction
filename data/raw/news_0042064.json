It wouldn’t work so well without all three of them.” Barcroft Media via Getty Images Scarlett's mum Betty, dad Mark Moffatt and ex-boyfriend Luke Codden all attended last month's National Television Awards with her. \nBetty and Mark did not appear on the last series of the show as they spent their time in Australia, supporting Scarlett on ‘I’m A Celebrity’. \nScarlett’s parents are not the only casualties of her busy schedule. Earlier this month she split from her boyfriend of one year, Luke Codden . \nThe pair had reportedly struggled to make time for each other in recent months as Scarlett’s career skyrocketed and the job offers flooded in . \nIn January she hosted the backstage coverage of the NTAs , she’s released a fitness DVD and is set to front a reboot of ‘Streetmate’, which launched Davina McCall. \nShe also recently signed a big money deal with Channel 4, which, as well as ‘Streetmate’, will see her filming a pilot TV show with Alan Carr. \nITV have also signed her up to join fellow Geordies Ant and Dec on ‘Saturday Night Takeaway’, which returns to our screens later this year.
