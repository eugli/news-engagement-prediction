The Free Beacon has reported multiple times on claims that VOA has been infiltrated by Iran regime loyalists who seek to spin coverage in a favorable way for Tehran. In one instance, an Iranian dissident was barred from appearing on VOA Persia for voicing critical opinions about the regime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:48:35.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
