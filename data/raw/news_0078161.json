Okja , a mysterious monster movie starring Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, Lily Collins, and 13-year-old South Korean star Ahn Seo-hyun, will debut on the service sometime in June. \nErik-Jan de Boe, the Academy Award-winning effects supervisor for Life of Pi , was responsible for the visual effects and the script was co-written by Bong and journalist / documentarist Jon Ronson ( The Men Who Stare at Goats , So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed ).\nRelated \n‘Snowpiercer’ review: take a train ride to the apocalypse The film centers on Ahn Seo-hyun’s character, a young girl who lives in the woods with her best friend Okja, a genetic science experiment that you catch only a glimpse of in the trailer. It has elephant skin and nice eyes. You also catch a glimpse of Tilda Swinton’s character, who looks to be a mad scientist in the vein of Silicon Valley. She has a platinum blonde bob and lots of Jurassic Park -sounding philosophies. You do not, for some reason, catch a glimpse of Jake Gyllenhaal’s character, but here is a photo of him from when the film shot in New York City last summer: \nOkja will premiere globally on Netflix in June and will have a limited day-and-date theatrical release in the U.S. #JakeGyllenhaal #Okja pic.twitter.com/fT5JUQzSVs \n— JakeGyllenhaal FF (@GyllenhaalicsFF) February 28, 2017 Okja will have a limited theatrical release in the US following its online debut, mimicking the release strategy that Netflix used for its first original film, Beasts of No Nation . This project is much bigger, with a $50 million budget compared to Beasts’ $6 million. Netflix probably doesn’t have to worry too much about traditional box office hauls, as Beasts of No Nation made only $91,000 in ticket sales but still won a SAG Award for Idris Elba, was streamed over three million times , and apparently encouraged the platform to keep dabbling in prestigious film projects.\nIt’s rumored that Okja may debut at the Cannes Film Festival in May.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:02:52.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
