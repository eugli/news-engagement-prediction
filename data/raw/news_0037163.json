Abraham 'Bambol' Tolentino, also the president of PhilCycling. \n\"The race not only tests our Filipino riders but to watch the skills of the foreign cyclists and to promote tourism,\" he added. READ: Le Tour de Filipinas offers new, more challenging route \nThis year also marks the second decade since the country hosted its first UCI race in 1996, when the local multi-stage road race was called the Marlboro Tour. Victor Espiritu won that foreign team-laced race as an amateur, with Hong Kong star Wong Kam Po winning the following year. \nThe Centennial Tour, aptly named to celebrate the country's 100th year celebration of Independence Day in 1998, saw Warren Davadilla claiming the trophy. But that was to be the last of the Marlboro Tour era following the enforcement of anti-tobacco laws in sports and other advertising platforms. \nAll teams have been accounted for the race that has Petron and UPS as principal sponsors and Philippine Airlines as official airline partner in Legaspi City, with the 75 cyclists warming up on the Albay capital's roads with the majestic Mayon Volcano as backdrop. \nOn Saturday, the cyclists will be flagged off at 8 a.m. by Ube Media president Donna May Lina, Legaspi City Mayor Noel Rosal, Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara, and PhilCycling chairman Bert Lina for the 164.49-km Legaspi City to Sorsogon Stage One. \nSunday's Stage Two will cover 177.35 kms from Sorsogon to Daet, while Stage Three on Monday is also 177.35 kms from Sorsogon to Naga City. \nThe 15 teams—13 foreign and two locals—will wrap up their campaign with the long 210-km northward Stage Four from Daet to Lucena City. \nThe Philippine National Team and 7 Eleven Roadbike Philippines will lead the local challenge against foreign squads Kinan Cycling Team (Japan), Team Ukyo (Japan), Bridgrestone Anchor Cycling Team (Japan), Terengganu Cycling Team (Malaysia), LX Pro Cycling Team (South Korea), Uzbekistan National Team, CCN Cycling Team (Laos), Keyi Look Sport Cycling Team (China), United Arab Emirates National Team, Attaque Team Gusto (Chinese Taipei), Kuwait Cartucho.ES (Kuwait) and Sapura Cycling Team (Malaysia). \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:54:47.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
