Alina Bradford/CNET \nDon't pay someone to water your plants while you're on vacation. Save that money for some sweet flip-flops and, instead, rummage through your recycling bin. All you need to make a automatic plant waterer is a wine bottle. Water your plants like you normally would Fill up the wine bottle with water Hold the wine bottle over the plant's pot Flip the bottle over and quickly stick the neck of the bottle into the soil Lean the bottle against the edge of the pot to keep it upright \nNow, you would think all of the water would just pour out of the bottle into the plant and create an indoor swamp. Nope. Since the soil is already wet, the water in the bottle won't flow into the soil. As the soil gradually dries, it absorbs water from the bottle, little by little. \nA wine bottle of water typically lasts one week in larger plants, like potted trees, and two to three weeks in smaller plants, like ivys and begonias. I've been using this trick for years and I've never been greeted by the wilted forms of my leafy pets upon returning home.
