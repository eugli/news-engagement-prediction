Police pressed charges on six operatives of local banned Islamist outfit the Jamaa'tul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB).\nThe militant group gained notoriety in 2005 after orchestrating a string of simultaneous explosions in 63 districts of Bangladesh after authorities outlawed it. \nIn July last year, police submitted the chargesheet in the court and the trials began in November after the court indicted the six militants. \nOn Sunday, the court of Rangpur's Special Judge Naresh Chandra Sarkar concluded the trial after hearing the closing arguments and scheduled the verdict delivery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T12:33:05.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
