By J. Scott Applewhite/Pool/Reuters. Though there’s been some attempts at slowing Donald Trump’s Cabinet appointees, the new president’s billionaire-heavy Team of Deplorables is slowly, if awkwardly, falling into place . (Not that that has prevented him from whining about it.) Now it seems as if First Lady Melania Trump is wading further into the waters of his presidency with a squad assembly of her own. The First Lady has spent the bulk of her time in the role so far in New York, where she’ll stay until the end of son Barron’s school year. If (and her people insist it’s more of a when ) she assumes the traditional duties of a First Lady, Melania will require a full team to help her advocate for a chosen cause (so far, anti-bullying seems to be the order of the day), plan and attend events, and host functions. Her team already includes a chief of staff, social secretary, senior adviser, and decorator, although there’s no word on whether the latter will add Melania Trump’s reported “glam room” to the historic mansion. And on Wednesday, she announced her White House social secretary, Anna Cristina Niceta Lloyd , as the newest member of her starting lineup. These are the first-round draft picks who—knowing the Trump administration—could be benched at any time (or run back to New York). Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, senior adviser As her first pick, Trump scooped up the New York event planner as a senior adviser . As The New York Times noted , Wolkoff’s move was a departure from her social circle of Hillary Clinton –supporting friends. Best known for her longtime work helping to organize the annual star-studded Met Gala, Wolkoff is a longtime friend of the First Lady. The former Vogue staffer was also the mastermind behind Trump’s inaugural events, which didn’t quite boast the same A-list crowds as the first Monday in May. Lindsay Reynolds, chief of staff In another major step away from New York and toward the White House, Trump announced last week that she had hired Reynolds as her chief of staff . Reynolds previously worked at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as associate director of the White House Visitors Office under George W. Bush . She’ll manage Trump’s agenda and the East Wing’s day-to-day operations. Tham Kannalikham, official White House decorator The Laotian-American designer might be drawn toward more traditional pieces, but for her selections to be approved, she will surely need the First Lady’s final word. Kannalikham, whose social-media accounts and Web site are either nonexistent or password protected , did get a profile in Architectural Digest , which noted Kannalikham’s preference for 18th-century designs in her work. Anna Cristina Niceta Lloyd, White House social secretary Lloyd, who goes by “Rickie,” is the newest recruit to the First Lady’s slowly forming Washington circle. According to a release , Nicita Lloyd’s “gracious entertaining style perfectly aligns with that of the First Lady.” She was behind the planning of the past five inaugurations and has worked to plan several state luncheons, summits, and conferences, according to the White House. She happens to be married to Thomas Lloyd , grandson of the late Bunny Mellon, who was a close friend and mentor of Jackie Kennedy. For now, the First Lady remains stationed in Trump Tower, building her squad from afar. Will she be adding any more dutiful charges to her team? Only time—and constant vigilance on the White House Web site—will tell. The women will hopefully help Trump run the East Wing better than her husband runs his Twitter account. Someone’s going to need a cool head and diplomatic touch to get that glam room built.
