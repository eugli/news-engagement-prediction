John McCain to fire back with force. U.S. Senator John McCain, left, smiles as he gets a t-shirt by Ukrainian journalist and politician Svitlana Zalishchuk on the last day of the Munich Security Conference in Munich, southern Germany, Sunday, Feb. 19, 2017. Tobias Hase/AP Highlight of the day \nAppearing on NBC's Meet the Press from Germany , the Republican said that a free press is \"vital.\" He said that \"if you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and many times adversarial press.\" \nAnd then McCain went full maverick as he considered America without a free press. \n\"That's how dictators get started,\" he said. \nHost Chuck Todd followed up immediately by asking if dictators get started with tweets like Trump's. McCain said, \"No, they get started by suppressing a free press.\" He added: \"When you look at history, the first thing dictators do is shut down the press.\" \n\"I'm not saying ... that President Trump is trying to be a dictator,\" he continued. \"I'm just saying we need to learn the lessons of history.\" \nMcCain's pal Sen. Lindsay Graham told CBS' Face the Nation that McCain was \"right to say that we need as politicians to understand the role of the press and jealously guard it.\" But he said that \"the bottom line here is America is not becoming a dictatorship.\" \nAnd the South Carolina Republican teed up some of his own shots at the media. \n\"I would say this to the American press corps: When it comes to Trump, you're over the top,\" he said. \nThen there was Reince Priebus, Trump's chief of staff, who doubled down on Trump's media critique . \n\"The problem we've got is that we're talking about bogus stories,\" he said, also on Face the Nation . \"And the media needs to, in some cases, not every case ... but in some cases, really needs to get its act together.\" Must-see TV \nIt's predictable that Trump aides would back up the president in his media fight. It's predictable that the press and others would object. It's even somewhat predictable that McCain would push the envelope among Republicans. \nBut how will Trump's Cabinet members proceed? \nDefense secretary James Mattis offered one approach by distancing himself from Trump's comments while not outright disavowing the president . In an interview conducted while visiting the United Arab Emirates, Mattis said that \"I don't have any issues with the press myself.\" \n\"I've had some rather contentious times with the press,\" he told Reuters . \"But no, the press are, as far as I'm concerned, a constituency that we will deal with.\" Um, what? \nOr maybe, \"Um, vad ?\" \nThat's the question that Swedes are asking after Trump singled out the Scandanavian country at a rally on Saturday as he highlighted several countries that have recently suffered terror attacks after accepting large numbers of refugees. \n\"You look at what's happening last night in Sweden,\" he said. \"Sweden, who would believe this?\" \nOne problem: Sweden didn't have any terror attacks happen on Friday. \n\"Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking?\" former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt wrote on Twitter. \"Questions abound.\" Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound. https://t.co/XWgw8Fz7tj \nA Swedish Foreign Ministry spokeswoman told The Associated Press on Sunday that the government wasn't aware of any \"terror-linked major incidents.\" And the Swedes have now asked the State Department for clarification on Trump's remarks . \nSo did Trump just have a bad IKEA experience or what? \nBusiness Insider suspects that Trump on Friday watched Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight . The show aired an interview that night with a documentary film maker whose latest work alleges instances of violence committed by refugees in Sweden. \nAnd Trump on Sunday took to Twitter to confirm that theory. My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017 \nTweeter in chief \nvia GIPHY \nWell, almost. \nBy early evening on Sunday, Trump had not Tweeted from either @realDonaldTrump or @POTUS . He then broke his social media silence by seeking to tidy up the confusion over what happened in Sweden on Friday night. \nStill, by Trump's standards, it was a quiet day on Twitter. Late-night lines \nvia GIPHY \nThis was for real. \nSaturday Night Live took the weekend off, ending a run of appointment viewing for their take on the Trump administration. With extra preparation time -- and a quite a bit of news to cover -- one can only wonder what the NBC pranksters have in store for next week. \nAn episode-long news conference featuring Alec Baldwin as Trump ? The latest chapter in the bizarre saga of \"CNN's Jake Tapper\" and \"senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway\"? Or just more Spicey time with Melissa McCarthy ? Use your long weekend wisely. Catch up on your favorite moments from this season so far. https://t.co/Wb9g3mWCj9 #SNL pic.twitter.com/yt3frdImix — Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) February 19, 2017 Notable numbers \nThe Associated Press did our work for us, gathering some key numbers from Trump's first month in office : \n24: Executive orders and memoranda signed.
