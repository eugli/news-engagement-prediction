Here's why you shouldn't They're after one thing -- money. And when they can't get it, they'll resort to any means necessary. | Topic: Security \nA few weeks ago, sophisticated scammers tricked Google into replacing its very top search result for Amazon.com with their own perfectly spoofed ad, which pointed to a Windows tech support scam. \nThe aim was simple enough: convince the hapless \"victim\" that their system was under attack by hackers or malware, and that they should call a number listed on the page. SECURITY Read More \nWe published that story . But after we posted, we realized the spoofed ad was only one part of the story. \nThese Windows tech support scams aren't new -- they've been around for years -- and their motives and reasons vary by scammer. \nMany of these scammers struggle nowadays because most people today know not to take suspicious or unsolicited phone calls. So, some scammers have figured out that to gain their trust, the victim has to call them. What better way than a perfectly-spoofed malicious ad from a trusted search engine? The scam begins then, and plays out in a carefully crafted, methodical way, drawing in the victim ever further one step at a time. \nWe wanted to see how these scammers operate and the tactics they used, so we can offer some advice to potential victims. \nThere's a saying in journalism. \"Don't feed the trolls.\" In other words, don't engage with someone you know to be malicious. But we thought this would be a reasonable exception. \nAnd so we went back to call the number on the website to see exactly what they wanted. \nThe scam seemed simple enough. The scammers wait until victims call them, putting the onus of responsibility on the caller. Then, using as little energy but with as much bluster as possible, they drown the caller in either fake or non-relevant information to raise the sense of urgency on the matter. With the threat of losing their files at the hands of hackers (who don't exist), the caller is pressured into turning over their credit card or checking account information. If all goes to plan, the scammers get paid and the caller gets peace of mind. \nBut when things don't go their way, things can quickly turn nasty. \nWe were using an isolated Windows 7 virtual machine hooked up to its host's Mac network connection. We put a few dummy files on the desktop to make it look like it wasn't a brand new virtual machine we had pulled directly from Microsoft . \nOver the course of a few days, we called the number numerous times from several phone numbers using the same script, and talked to different people at various times of the day and night. \nThe \"technician\" asked various questions about the computer to gain trust, and walked through how to give him remote control access to the computer. \nThe technician then pulled up the Windows Action Center to show which security services were enabled and which weren't. (For what it's worth, our virtual machine was woefully out-of-date, which didn't exactly hurt his cause.) Then, he pulled up a command window to display the computer's local and foreign IP addresses. Again, nothing untoward here, but he claimed it was \"hackers\" piggybacking the connection for cybercrime, which is nonsense. Then, he pulled up Windows' Event Viewer, which logs issues relating to the computer's performance and stability. There will be hundreds if not thousands of entries in here as standard for any ordinary user and is generally no cause for alarm, yet these events were positioned as hackers gaining access to the computer's files. \nThis would be utter nonsense to to those in the know, but also convincing enough to those who know no better. \nAll of these \"issues\" could be easily fixed in just a few minutes, said the technician. He then explained the services provided by his company -- always referring to himself or his company as \"Windows certified technicians\" -- all of which are tailored based on what he \"diagnosed.\" More security news ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:09:27.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
