Spencer opted for a checkered two-piece suit, layered over a thick black jumper. All eyes on her: Heidi oozed sophistication in a bedazzled backless frock, which hugged her surgically enhanced curves in all the right areas Ever the attention-grabber, Spencer donned a Phantom of the Opera-esque mask as he headed out of the West End show, beaming from ear to ear. Speidi - who married in 2009 - have been making the most of their time in the capital since they were booted out of the infamous CBB house. The couple enjoyed a night out on the town with Spencer's fellow reality star sister Stephanie Pratt at The Dorchester Hotel on Saturday, while relishing some alone time at the Bocca De Lupo restaurant on Monday. Despite willingly going into the Channel 5 series for a second time, Speidi admitted after last Friday's eviction that this experience was far less enjoyable then their first frenzied appearance on 2013's installment. Loved-up: The controversial couple seemed to be making the most of their alone time in the capital as they enjoyed their theatrical date night Discussing their friendship with X Factor duo Jedward, the former Hills stars admitted the pair have become 'nasty'. Speaking about the brothers' etiquette towards Nicola McLean, Heidi admitted that Jedward had been using the same taunts to her about her hair and beauty. She said: 'Nic is right. I feel they get on with me the most but they'll say to me all day, \"Your hair looks good but it could look way better\" or \"you barely wear make-up on your face but I guess that looks good\", like all day. 'But then they go in mean too with Nic and there's just a line. I understand them being players that way, and maybe that's part of their personality but they're just getting nasty and mean with it.' They're out!
