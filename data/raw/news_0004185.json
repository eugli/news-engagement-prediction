Sdoia's mother set her up with the handsome firefighter when she laid up with an amputated leg in the wake of the April 2013 bombing, the New York Post reported. Love was the last thing on her mind back then. \"In the hospital, my mom tried to set me up with him,\" Sdoia said. \"She was like, 'Oh, did you see that firefighter? He's so cute.' And I was like, 'Mom, I just got blown up.'?\" But later the victim and her hero struck up a romance that will soon lead to marriage. Sdoia's road to recovery will take her to the Empire State Building where she and her fiance will participate in the annual race up the 1,576 stairs to benefit charity, the daily said. Sdoia, 48, a long-distance runner, was a spectator near the marathon finish line when the pressure-cooker bombs went off. Materia, 37, rushed to her aid and comforted her during the ride to Massachusetts General Hospital in a police vehicle. Materia visited a couple days later and made a great impression on her mother while Sdoia was recovering in intensive care.
