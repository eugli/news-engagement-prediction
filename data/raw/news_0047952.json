We said ‘if this is war, God help us’.” \nJapan’s deadly campaign brought a distant war to home soil, and the Northern Territory had become the front line. \nIt was the largest and most destructive single attack mounted by a foreign power on Australia and led to the worst death toll from any event in the nation’s history. \nThe assault was more savage than Pearl Harbor; more bombs fell on Darwin, more civilians were killed, and more ships were sunk.

Now 81, she remembers air raid sirens ringing and her parents arguing in their home when she heard a loud banging on the front door. Wendy James remembers evacuating Darwin at age six.

So we ended up with all these strips of paper,” she said. \n“But at least we’d heard from him. His signature was at the bottom, so we knew he was alive.” \nWhen James returned to Darwin in 1945, her town was unrecognisable –devastated by 18 months of air raids. \nSchool wouldn’t resume for a year, so the then 10-year-old roamed old army camps, playing with ammunition that had been left behind. \n“My brother and I went around on bicycles trying to find the Darwin we remembered,” she said. \n“We went looking for the house we’d lived in, and it had disappeared. Chinatown had been completely wiped out.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:09:01.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
