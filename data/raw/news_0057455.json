Uju Kingsley, regardless of party affiliations has always recognized and accorded Emma Orie all the necessary respect/support deserving of a lawmaker. \n“Whoever knows Emma Orie, should ask him why he is feeling threatened? He should as well tell us where and when Hon. Uju boasted he was the architect of the amnesty programme ?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:35:16.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
