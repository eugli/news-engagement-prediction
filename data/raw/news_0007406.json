According to their page: \n\"In his inaugural address, Donald Trump said that all people would be heard under his administration. 'The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,' he proclaimed. 'Everyone is listening to you now.' While Trump's staff is still learning how to use their computers, our intention is to help them fulfill his promise of transparency by providing the people with an additional way to be heard.\"' \nApparently, a good chunk of numbers STILL work!
