Asked how he could speak Marathi so well, he said he had heard about Raj Thackeray-led MNS’s agitation against non-Marathi speaking migrants, and therefore the first thing he did after landing in Pune to look for a job one year ago was to join a class to learn Marathi. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:33:57.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
