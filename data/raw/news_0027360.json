Good rice and cotton summer crops \nThe forecast for summer crops - cotton, sorghum and rice - has been downgraded slightly due to the warmer and drier weather in northern NSW and Queensland. \nABARES said the area planted to cotton was estimated to be more than double last year, and the harvest was forecast to be 64 per cent higher than last year. \nABARES expects there to be 1 million tonnes of lint and 1.5 million tonnes of cottonseed. \nBut the bigger cotton crop will come at the expense of grain sorghum. \n\"The irrigated growers got good supplies of irrigation water and early in the planting window for cotton they had good moisture profile, and on top of that the returns from cotton compared to grain sorghum were quite favourable,\" Mr Collins said. \nRice planting is almost four times larger in 2016-17 than last year, with an increase in irrigation water. \nRice production is forecast to be 870,000 tonnes, up from 250,000 tonnes last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:07:12.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
