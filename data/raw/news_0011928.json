So, a different ad was shown on television, but the original was still posted online. \nThe commercial cuts between a Mexican mother and daughter trekking through the desert toward the United States border and workers working on a construction project. \nEventually, the mother and daughter arrive at the border only to find a massive wall in their path once they arrive. \nThe ad then cuts to an American man driving a pickup truck along a desert road with wood and tools in the back of the truck. The mother and daughter then walk further down the wall to find that someone had built a giant wooden door into the side of the wall. \nThe two walk through to the American side. \n84 Lumber describes the ad as containing “content deemed too controversial for the original ad and banned from broadcast. See what lies ahead as a mother and daughter’s symbolic migrant journey continues to its moving conclusion.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:59:03.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
