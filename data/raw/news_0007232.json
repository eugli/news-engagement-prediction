You aren’t doing enough to stop them,“ Mr Trump is reported to have told Mr Pena Nieto. ”I think your military is scared. Our military isn’t, so I just might send them down to take care of it.”\nThe White House would not comment on the purported transcript, but denied that the US was planning to invade Mexico.\nOn Friday, the two leaders issued a joint statement saying they had discussed the need to “work together to stop drug cartels, drug trafficking and illegal guns and arms sales”.\nThe phone call was meant to patch up tensions between the heads of state but, if authentic, the transcript suggests that President Trump may still be using the same brash style that he employed on the campaign trail.\nTensions between the US and Mexico, longtime allies, have heightened since Mr Trump’s inauguration.\nIn one of his first acts as president, Mr Trump signed an executive order calling for the immediate construction of a border wall between the countries. \nA few days later, he tweeted that Mr Peña Nieto should not visit Washington for a scheduled meeting unless Mexico was prepared to pay for construction of the wall.\nThe controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 10 show all The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 1/10 Trump and abortion Protesters flood Independence Avenue during the Women's March\nGetty\n2/10 Trump and abortion US President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus looks on in the Oval Office of the White House\nGetty Images\n3/10 Trump and 'Obamacare' Nancy Pelosi who is the minority leader of the House of Representatives speaks beside House Democrats at an event to protect the Affordable Care Act in Los Angeles, California.
