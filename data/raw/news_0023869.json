Anthony Dasher One would never imagine talking to Georgia outfielder Will Campbell that behind the smile once lurked a player with a bit of temper problem.\nHe can laugh about it now.\n“Yeah, I was that hot-head kid growing up. I was throwing helmets when I was younger and it took me a while to grow up, although I guess I haven’t 100 percent because I still get mad,” the transfer from Chattahoochee Valley Community College said. “I’ve finally learned how to contain it. Give me two seconds and it’s out of my system, after a bad AB or something like that. But yeah, I was that hot-head 10-year old – 100 percent.”\nThat’s not to say the fire no longer burns. Quite the contrary.\nBy his own admission, the Woodstock native says he becomes a different person when he’s at the plate where failing to succeed is not an option.\n“I’m pretty fiery. Off the field, I’m pretty laid back,” Campbell said. “But on the field, the competitive juices get going … I hate losing.”\nBulldog skipper Scott Stricklin isn’t about to complain about that.\n“He doesn’t take kindly to a poor at-bat and he’s one of those guys … we need a little bit of that,” Stricklin said. “He’s just a hardnosed and a really good player.”\nThe Bulldogs are glad he’s on their side.\nAfter winning the Alabama Community College Conference triple crown with a .425 batting average, 19 home runs and 83 RBI, Campbell originally committed to Vanderbilt before an issue over classes still needed to transfer caused him to change his mind and pick the Bulldogs instead.\nCampbell explained he was already having a case of “committer’s remorse” when he said \"yes\" to the Commodores to begin with.\n“It was probably the toughest thing I ever had to do, not committing to Georgia,” Campbell said. “When it opened, it was just like God’s plan for me to come to Georgia. I called Coach Stricklin up and he was still all for it, so you never know what’s going to happen in life. I couldn’t be happier.”\nCampbell’s power numbers come despite the fact he’s listed as weighing only 178 pounds.\nSo, what’s his secret?\n“I guess just a lot of wrist work. I always kind of swung harder when I was little and I guess that’s what developed my bat speed,” Campbell said. “My family always talked about me growing up. I’ve always had the bat speed. I don’t think it matters at all how big you are, but how fast you swing the bat. I guess I swing it pretty fast.”\nStricklin can attest to that.\n“He has a really good approach at the plate, he barrels it up,” Stricklin said. “When it comes off his bat it looks different, it sounds different.”\nCampbell figures to get plenty of opportunities to show what he can do for the Bulldogs.\nAccording to Stricklin, the former Etowah High standout will hit somewhere in the middle of the lineup – likely cleanup or fifth – where fingers are being crossed he can produce numbers similar to what he did last year in junior college.\n“I can’t wait. I’ve always been the guy who wants to be on the biggest stage as possible to play in. That’s always been my dream to come here and play in the SEC,” Campbell said. “If I get lucky enough to be in the middle of the order and be a big RBI guy, I’ve love to have as many chances in the eighth or ninth inning with a couple of runners on, and we’re down by one or tied. I would love as many chances as possible.”\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-3.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/x8usguxpiblvzfadpi5v)", "https://res-3.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/x8usguxpiblvzfadpi5v"], "published": "2017-02-06T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:53:39.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
