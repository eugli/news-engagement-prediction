During the course of the conversation, as you know and it was confirmed by the President’s officials spokesman, the President assured me that he would continue with — honour the agreement we entered into with the Obama administration with respect top refugee resettlement,” Mr Turnbull replied.\nAnother question from the press pack: “Was President Trump upset with parts of the conversation?”\nDonald Trump and Malcolm Turnbull. Picture: AP/AAP Source: AAP \n“Look, thanks for your inquiry,” Mr Turnbull shot back, clearly uncomfortable and hoping to move on to another subject.\n“I’m not going to comment on these reports out of the United States about the conversation.”\nThe questions just kept coming. Another reporter commented that the “Australian public would be interested in your relationship with our most important partner”.\n“Did he hang up the phone to you earlier than you expected?” the reporter asked.\n“I’m not — I’m not going to comment on these reports of a conversation,” Mr Turnbull said again. “Australians know me very well. I always stand up for Australia in every forum.”\nMr Turnbull was asked again, this time specifically, if there was any reference from Mr Trump about Australia trying to “export the Boston bombers”, as had been reported.\nA familiar line from the PM: “I’m not going to comment on a conversation between myself and the President of the United States other than what we have said publicly. You can surely understand the reasons for that.\n“I appreciate your interest, but it’s better that these things — these conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately. If you see reports of them, I’m not going to add to them.”\nMore questions from the media. Not about renewable energy.\n“What do you say to Australians who are going to be reading this report right now about our special relationship with the US, which seems to be undermined by Donald Trump’s language to you and when he hung up the phone to you after 25 minutes?”\n“I can assure you the relationship is very strong,” Mr Turnbull said. “The fact we received the assurance that we did, the fact that it was confirmed, the very extensive engagement we have with the new administration underlines the closeness of the alliance. But as Australians know me very well — I stand up for Australia in every forum — public or private.”\nIn dark times, it’s worth remembering that Mr Trump once loved Australia.\nAustralia is a beautiful country with terrific people who love America.\n— Donald J.
