Adama Barrow \n“The Government of Gambia has notified Antonio Guterres in his capacity as depository of the Rome Statue of its decision to discontinue the withdrawal notice,” said a statement issued by the government late Monday, referring to the UN secretary-general. \nNew Gambian President Adama Barrow had promised during his December election campaign to rejoin the ICC and the Commonwealth group of nations, reversing Jammeh’s more insular foreign policy. \nFormer Gambian Information Minister Sheriff Bojang had accused the ICC of being used “for the persecution of Africans and especially their leaders” while ignoring crimes committed by the West. \nBojang referred to the ICC as “the International Caucasian Court,” a personal blow against the tribunal’s chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, a Gambian lawyer and former justice minister. \nCurrently nine out of the ICC’s 10 investigations concern African countries, the other being Georgia. \nHowever experts point out that many of the current investigations — in the Central African Republic, Uganda, Mali and the Democratic Republic of Congo — were referred to the ICC by the governments of those states.
