We saw this happen before in the prohibition era â€” people dying from drinking tainted beer. Instead, we regulated alcohol and beer and that changed everything.\"\nOver the last year, B.C. has seen a record number of overdoses.\nAt least 914 people died last year. Sixty per cent of those deaths involved the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl.\nVancouver area drug users held a march on the Downtown Eastside Tuesday, urging the government to do more to combat the opioid crisis in B.C. (Cliff Shim/CBC News)\nOverdose deaths are now the leading cause of unnatural death in the province. \nWestfall says if there was a regulated drug market, users would know what they were ingesting and overdoses could be prevented. \nThe Vancouver march was one of eight organized across the country on the first national day of action.\nMany people brought signs and pictures of loved ones they have lost to overdoses.\nWestfall says activists will continue these rallies until policy changes are made.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:59:03.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
