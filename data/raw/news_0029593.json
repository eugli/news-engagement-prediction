It has instead strangely bestowed Wee Kim Wee with that honour. \nBy doing this, the govt has changed our history, and subverted the very basis of the Elected President scheme: to have the president go through an actual election so that he will have the moral authority to carry out his duty as a check on the govt, on behalf of the people of Singapore. \nArticle 17(2) of our Constitution states clearly: \n\"The President shall be elected by the citizens of Singapore in accordance with any law made by the Legislature.\" \nPresident Wee never went through an actual election. President Ong did and was the first president to do so. Am I missing something or is this a non-issue? Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
