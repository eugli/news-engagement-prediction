(AFP/Getty Images) \nBernardo Silva has been tipped to reach the same level as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo by his Monaco team-mate Joao Moutinho. \nLast week, reports claimed that Chelsea have already opened talks with the Ligue 1 leaders over a summer deal for the Portugal international, who is valued at €80m (£68.4m) . \nManchester United are also reportedly keen on a deal and Moutinho believes the 22-year-old is on course to become an elite player. \n‘When Bernardo arrived, I straight away said he was a good player but that he needed to keep working,’ said Moutinho. Silva’s form has been praised by Moutinho. (AFP/Getty Images) \n‘And that’s what he’s done this year. He had two fine seasons but this year he’s really been a revelation. \n‘Messi, Eusebio, Cristiano Ronaldo, Maradona, Pele. They’re players who are and will remain in football history. I hope and believe that Bernardo has the quality to get close to that level.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:31:07.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
