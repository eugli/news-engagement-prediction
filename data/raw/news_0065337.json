The ladies previously got lunch together in L.A. on January 22, which was, of course, documented on Twitter.

Stars Who Got Their Start on Reality TV \nJohnson, who hadn’t spent quality time with the Bachelor hopefuls until Wednesday night, previously told Entertainment Tonight that he has a crush on Olympios. \n“Yeah [I’m interested in Corinne],” he told ET during a Facebook Live interview on Monday, February 20 “I mean, I don’t know what she’s like in person, but we’ve texted a little bit. I knew that because she was the villain, nobody was really going to be talking to her.” \nThe Bachelor in Paradise alum added, “She was probably going through this all alone, and you think no matter how hardheaded you are … I knew people were probably just tearing her down, so I just wanted to let her know, like, ‘Try not to look at it. Let it pass. It will slow down.’ She’s good now. … She seems pretty cool. She obviously doesn’t care at all what anybody thinks.” Meet Nick Viall's 'Bachelor' Season 21 Contestants! \nAnd when Olympios stopped by The Ellen DeGeneres Show on February 1, she also had nothing but sweet things to say about Johnson. “He’s really cool. Great guy, so nice,” she gushed. “[He has] my back, like [he tells me]: ‘Don’t worry about what other people say, I think you’re awesome.’ “ \nThe Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET. \nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!
