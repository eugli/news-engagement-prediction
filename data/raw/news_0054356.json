A replica of the General Lee, the name of the car that the main characters in the show drove, is to drive off a 15-foot high ramp on Atwater near the convention hall and fly through the air for 30 feet or more. \nFrom 2016: 1st Aussie car to participate in Detroit Autorama \n\"It's going to be an unbelievable stunt,\" said Pete Toundas, the president and owner of the group that puts on Autorama. \"It's going to simulate the scenes going back to 'The Dukes of Hazzard' days. This will be a special stunt car with a lot of safety features built into it. It will look just like the General Lee.\" \nToundas expects the stunt — which is scheduled for 11:45 a.m. and open to the public — to draw a crowd just before Autorama's doors open at noon. \nToundas said the show will feature the General Lee because the car — an orange, 1969 Dodge Charger with the number 01 on its doors and a Confederate flag on its roof — has long been associated with Autorama, now in its 65th year. Two stars from the TV show — Catherine Bach, who played Daisy, and Tom Wopat, who played Luke — are scheduled to appear from 1-5 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. \nThe General Lee will be appearing at Autorama this weekend. (Photo: Autorama) \nThe Confederate flag, which will be on the stunt car, became the subject of national debate two years ago after the death of nine people in a Charleston, S.C., church. Warner Bros. later said it would stop licensing General Lee toy cars and models that included the flag. And golfer Bubba Watson, who bought the original car featured in the show, had the flag painted over. \nThe TV show ran from 1979 to 1985. Stunts often ended in crashes, costing the show hundreds of orange Chargers. \nSee-through barriers will be put up along Atwater to protect spectators. Depending on what happens to the General Lee after the stunt, it may go on display at the show. \nContact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 or fwitsil@freepress.com. If you go \nWhen: 11:45 a.m. Friday \nWhere: Atwater, near Cobo Center in Detroit \nCost: It will be free to see the stunt, which is open to the public. Tickets to the show, which starts at noon, are $20 for adults, $7 for children ages 6-12, free for kids 5 and younger. Discount tickets are available at O'Reilly Auto Parts. \nThe General Lee will be appearing at Autorama this weekend.
