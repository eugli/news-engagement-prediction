Andre Iguodala Begins Behind the Basket \nRemember what we said about hang time? This is what we meant. 13/23 11. Vince Carter Clears the Judges’ Table \nVince Carter’s performance in the ‘00 contest is indisputably the greatest we’ve ever seen. Ironically, his final dunk isn’t his best. More from him later. 14/23 10. Serge Ibaka Goes Beyond the Free-Throw Line \nSimply put, this is the longest leap we’ve ever seen in the dunk contest. The yellow shoes drive it home. 15/23 9. Aaron Gordon Leaps the Mascot \nMight be the most loopable dunk here. So many goodies to unpack: the leap, lifting both legs, the scoop, the jam. The coordination is terrific. 16/23 8. Jason Richardson Reverses It \nSetting precedent is important, and when Richardson slammed this down, it was something nobody had ever witnessed before. 17/23 7. KryptoNate Defeats Superman \nHow do you beat one of the great dunk-showmans ever? Put him on a poster and steal the show yourself. From conception to execution, Nate Robinson earned his title over Dwight Howard in 2009. 18/23 6. Vince Carter Dunks His Elbow \nOften imitated, Carter stuffed his entire forearm into the hoop during this next 2000 dunk. The crazy thing is, he wasn’t done. 19/23 5. Julius Erving Takes Flight \nFree-throw line dunks have a bad rap now. Go stand on a basketball court and note how far the line is from the hoop. It seems impossible to even graze the rim, much less put a ball through it. Dr. J was the first to make a spectacle of the feat. 20/23 4. Dominique Wilkins Two-Hands A Windmill \nDunk contest tip: Any dunk is much harder for the pros with two hands, because you have to be faster and higher in the air instead of being able to stretch the ball with one arm. ‘Nique’s two-hander here came in 1988. It was only bested by this next guy. 21/23 3. Michael Jordan Double Clutches \nDr. J popularized this dunk, but when Jordan added the clutch, he put the full athleticism and talent of the Greatest Player Ever on display. It was a moment. It felt like no one had ever jumped higher, or farther, or would again. An all-timer in every sense.
