By Lee Moran A fire truck fell victim to the violent storm that battered southern California on Friday night. Dramatic video shows the San Bernardino County Fire District vehicle plunging off the side of the Interstate 15 highway at the Cajon Pass after the road beneath it gave way. Incredibly, no one was injured . Firefighters had evacuated the truck minutes earlier when the road partially crumbled to leave it teetering on the edge. CajonPass(Update): All firefighters confirmed safe. The lane under the fire engine has failed, and the engine has gone over the side. — SB County Fire (@SBCOUNTYFIRE) February 18, 2017 The fire crews were attending a big rig that had also toppled off the highway when the incident occurred, according to ABC7’s Eyewitness News, which shared the footage online.
