Not every cricketer has multi-million endorsement deals. The real incentive should be playing Test cricket,\" a top BCCI source told PTI on Wednesday. \n\nAnother aspect that has been taken into consideration while preparing the proposal is that not every top Indian player is earning a lot from the endorsement market. \n\n\"As a brand, it is Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who are marketable stars among the current players as far as TV Commercials are concerned. It is very difficult to find brands consistently for a Pujara or say an Umesh Yadav . But they are performers in their own rights. Not everyone will remain marketable once their 10-15 year career is over. If BCCI is able to provide that cushion, there is no harm,\" the source added. \n\nThe IPL auction at times has caused a lot of heartburn for established names. The cricketing fraternity was in a state of shock that ICC's World No.1 ranked T20 spinner Imran Tahir went unsold. \n\nWhile franchises have their business interest in mind when they reject a Pujara, dubbed as Test specialist or Ishant for a high base price, but some are baffled as to how a few of the lesser known players in the Rs 10 lakh bracket get teams. \n\n\"There is a Delhi player, who has been picked by Gujarat Lions for Rs 10 lakh. It's the lowest base price. But this boy has failed to make it to the Delhi T20 playing XI post 2014. So where did he perform and make a case for himself? And what exactly is the message that you are sending to a Priyank Panchal, who has close to 1500 runs this first-class season. You are just bracketing him as a first-class player,\" a former support staff of an IPL franchise said. \n\nIf the COA seriously considers the proposals, some of the longer format specialists will not feel hard done by the big bad world of auction where private entities decide the worth of sportspersons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:40:19.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
