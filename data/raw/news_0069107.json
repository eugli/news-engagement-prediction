San Luis Obispo, Calif.-based Sports Warehouse will over time invest up to $20 million and create more than 340 jobs, a Forsyth County economic developer told Atlanta Business Chronicle. Details of the expansion , codenamed Project Deuce, were reported Wednesday. Enlarge Sean Pavone Photo The Sports Warehouse family of companies include Tennis Warehouse, Running Warehouse, Tackle Warehouse, Skate Warehouse, Inline Warehouse, Ice Warehouse, Derby Warehouse, Riding Warehouse, Art’s Cyclery, Racquetball Warehouse and Total Pickleball. In addition to corporate offices, Sports Warehouse will locate a distribution center and call center in a 117,000 square-foot building at 1295 Bluegrass Lakes Parkway, said Robert Long , vice president of economic development at the Cumming-Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce . Sports Warehouse could also acquire adjacent land for future expansion. The expansion was expected to be announced Feb. 28. However, the Georgia Department of Economic Development announced the deal in a statement on Wednesday evening, surprising Forsyth officials. Sports Warehouse will open a $14 million East Coast e-commerce fulfillment and distribution center in Forsyth County, the statement noted. It made no mention of a corporate headquarters relocation. On late Wednesday, James McCoy , CEO of the Cumming-Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce, reiterated the county's economic development team was informed by Sports Warehouse about its headquarters relocation plans. “The new distribution center will enable us to offer faster shipping and more convenient customer service hours to our customers in the South, Midwest, and East Coast,” Drew Munster , president of Sports Warehouse noted in the statement. “From our new facility in Forsyth County we’ll be able to offer free overnight Ground service for most orders to Georgia and Alabama, and much of Tennessee, as well other major cities such as Jacksonville and Charlotte.\" Sports Warehouse considered five metro areas in the Southeast for the relocation. South Forsyth was picked because of its proximity to Alpharetta which has a diverse and technology-focused workforce, Long noted Metro Atlanta is also a logistics hub, with its central location and rail, road and port access. The region is attracting major projects. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. will put a 550,000 square-foot distribution center in Fairburn, Atlanta Business Chronicle reported Feb. 21. Meanwhile, AmerisourceBergen Corp.'s (NYSE: ABC) will open a 350,000 square-foot \"Amazon-like\" high-tech distribution center in Buford, the Chronicle reported Feb. 16. And late last year, United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS) confirmed plans for a $400 million logistics campus near Charlie Brown Airport.
