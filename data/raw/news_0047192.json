Ronald Fiddler / Jamal al-Harith / Abu Zakariya al-Britani \nJamal al-Harith, a Muslim convert who used used the nom de guerre Abu-Zakariya al-Britani and was born Ronald Fiddler, is said to have detonated an explosives-filled vehicle in a village to the south of the Iraqi city. Abu-Zakariya al-Britani Credit: Universal News And Sport (Europe) \nT he bomber was released from the US detention camp in 2004 and successfully claimed £1 million compensation after saying British agents knew or were complicit in his mistreatment. \nThe Britani suffix has been used regularly for militants from the UK. 2. Mohammed Emwazi / Jihadi John \nEmwazi was reported killed in a November 2015 air strike, with US forces saying they were \"reasonably certain\" he was dead. \nIsil later released what appeared to be an obituary to the fighter, who it called Abu Muharib al-Muhajir. \nIt featured a smiling picture of the militant, who appeared unmasked looking towards the ground. Mohammed Enwazi \nE mwazi shocked the world when he appeared in a video in August 2014 in which he condemned the West and appeared to behead US journalist James Foley. \nHe emerged again in a number of other videos released by Isil, including those in which American reporter Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning were murdered. \nKuwait-born Emwazi attended Quintin Kynaston Community Academy in north London and was described by his former head teacher as a \"hard-working aspirational young man\". \nHe went on to gain a degree in information systems with business management from the University of Westminster. 3. Reyaad Khan \nKhan was 20 when he appeared in an Isil propaganda video titled, There Is No Life Without Jihad, in June last year together with two other Britons urging Westerners to join the war. \nThe man, from Cardiff, is thought to have travelled to fight in Syria late in 2013. \nHis Facebook page revealed that he was a Chelsea FC fan who enjoyed playing computer games FIFA 12 and Call Of Duty. \nAfter appearing in the video with a Kalashnikov assault rifle against his shoulder his mother said she believed he had been \"brainwashed\" into joining Isil. Reyaad Khan and Ruhul Amin \nI n a direct appeal to her son, the woman, who asked to remain unnamed, sobbed as she said: \"Reyaad, please come back home. I'm dying for you. You're my only son.\" \nBefore leaving for Syria, Khan attended Cardiff's Al-Manar Centre (ACT) together with Nasser Muthana, who was also filmed for the Isil recruitment video. \nThe mosque denied the pair had been taught extremist views there and blamed the internet as an \"alarming source for radicalisation\". \nDavid Cameron, the then Prime Minister, said Khan had been killed on August 21 2015 when he was targeted by an RAF remotely piloted aircraft while travelling in a vehicle in Raqqah, Syria. 4. Ruhul Amin \nAmin, 26, featured alongside Khan and Muthana in the 13-minute Isil recruitment video under the name Brother Abu Bara al Hindi. \nWearing sunglasses and a white headscarf, he could be heard saying: \"Are you willing to sacrifice the fat job you've got, the big car, the family you have? \n\"Are you willing to sacrifice this, for the sake of Allah? If you do Allah will give you back 700 times more.\" \nAlso known as Abdul Raqib Amin, he was born in Bangladesh and grew up in Aberdeen before reportedly moving with his family to Leicester. Amin \nI n July 2014 he boasted on ITV's Good Morning Britain that he had been \"involved in a few combats\" in Syria. \nExplaining the moment he left Britain, he said: \"I left the house with the intention of not to go back. I'm going to stay and fight until the (caliphate) is established, or I die.\" \nA leading member of Aberdeen's Muslim community, who did not want to be identified, said he was not someone who \"stood out in any particular way\". \nHe was killed in the same airstrike as Khan. 5. Junaid Hussain \nComputer hacker Hussain was described as a key Isil operative before he was killed by a US drone strike on August 24 2016. \nThe 21-year-old, from Birmingham, was said to have been number three on the Pentagon's \"kill list\" of Isil targets. \nIt is believed that he fled Britain to travel to Syria in 2013, and in June last year he was linked to a plot to attack an Armed Forces Day parade in south London. Junaid Hussain \nT he plan to explode a pressure cooker bomb - killing soldiers and bystanders on the route - was reportedly foiled after Hussain unwittingly recruited an undercover investigator from The Sun to carry it out. \nIn June 2012, aged 18, Hussain was jailed for six months after he admitted making prank calls to a counter-terror hotline and publishing former prime minister Tony Blair's address book. \nHe was a member of TeaMpOisoN (TeamPoison), a group which claimed responsibility for more than 1,400 offences where personal and private information has been illegally extracted from victims in the UK and around the world. \nHussain was reportedly married to a Muslim convert named as Sally Jones, a mother-of-two from Kent who once was a member of an all-girl punk rock group.
