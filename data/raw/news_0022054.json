I was watching Arsenal fans slating him [Wenger] and I thought he doesn’t deserve that. He’s done an unbelievable job.” 'Arsene Wenger remains but Arsenal's title DNA has been totally lost' \nRobbie Lyle, the founder and face of Arsenal Fan TV, will tackle Neville (right) on the issue when they meet on the YouTube channel. \nHowever, Lyle said today: “I’m not saying people can’t be critical of us, you have to accept their criticism, but I just feel that when it comes to criticising fans and saying they’re ‘embarrassing’ that’s overstepping the mark. You may not agree with what they’re saying but to call them ‘idiots’ and things like that, I don’t think is right.
