But in terms of sheer insanity and ratchetness combined with that Austin street fight cinematography the city is now known for, this video submitted a hell of an effort. Women laying it all on the line to attack other women for undeniably idiotic reasons. Rolling around on the floor, cheap shots, not a single concern for decency. Every chick involved here had warrior blood in them, some of it perhaps splattered around the pavement. And much like that last Austin video, it also had one standout character, one not even part of the fight. This hilarious fucking idiot: \nTEBOWING. In 2017. Amidst titties and fists and insanity, this kid brought back 2012’s hottest trend right in everyone’s faces. Thankfully The Man gave him a chance to get his quality Instagrams off before tossing him like a toddler: \nNeed more Austin street fights like I need air. Get weird for me, Austin. Get real weird.
