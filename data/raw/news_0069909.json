Open wounds near the fractured leg had become severely infected. \nA local veterinarian had to euthanize the horse because its injuries were so severe. \nBecause the gate to the well site had been cut, thereby bypassing a cattle guard, investigators believe someone dumped the horse on the site, Parker County Sheriff Larry Fowler said. \n\"Due to the extensive nature of the mare's injuries, there was no possible way she could have wandered passed a cattle guard and a locked gate,\" Kessler said in a written release. \nThe mare was estimated to be between 10 and 11 years old and is believed to have received new horseshoes within the last two months. Kessler said the horse was well-groomed and that her body condition suggests she had been cared for. \n\"She should be easy to identify by an unusual pattern in the center of her blaze,\" Kessler said, noting that the owner may live in Tarrant County. \nNo tattoos, brands or other identification markings were found on the mare. A microchip scan was unable to find the owner. \nAnyone who recognizes the mare or has any information about the owner is encouraged to contact the sheriff's office at 817-594-3213.
