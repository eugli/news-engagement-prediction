Read More Salmonella bacteria destroyed tumours in mice in just 12 days (Photo: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/PA) \nThe study was carried out at Chonnam National ­University in South Korea. \nA paper said: “The engineered bacteria induced an effective anti-tumour immune response, successfully treating tumours in several different mouse models with no evidence of toxicity. \n“The tumour was no longer detectable in 11 of 20 mice at the end point.” \nPrevious research has hinted bacteria such as salmonella could be effective in the fight against cancer. But this is the first to prove it can kill the disease. \nChonnam Professor of Microbiology Joon Haeng Rhee said: “We believe this was a groundbreaking trial. \n“We have a tangible plan to start preclinical and clinical trials.” Joon Haeng Rhee has hailed the breakthrough \nThe Institute of Cancer Research in London praised the study. Biological therapies expert Professor Kevin Harrington said: “This is a ­fascinating new approach to using bacteria. \n\"Instead of asking bacteria to kill cancer cells directly, researchers have genetically engineered salmonella so it expresses a gene that triggers the immune system to mount an attack on the tumour. \n“The results show that this approach is effective against a range of tumour types with little or no toxicity in mice.” \nThe findings were revealed in Science Translational Medicine a journal published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which is hosting the world’s biggest science conference in Boston. \nBacterial cancer therapy dates back to the 19th century when surgeons noticed tumours would shrink in infected patients. Salmonella could be an effective treatment against cancer (Photo: Getty) \nBut it was largely axed when surgical and ­chemical therapies emerged in the 20th century. \nSince then, some success in bacterial treatment has been reported, with ­scientists using germs to deliver anti-cancer medicines to the body. \nBut these require multiple injections and relapses are common. Bacteria acts like Lego on immune cells, says Dr Catherine Pickworth from Cancer Research UK \nThis study, carried out in mice, shows that bacteria can be used to trigger the immune system to attack cancer cells. \nIn this study the researchers injected the bacteria into the mice where it was delivered to the tumour through the blood, causing an immune reaction. \nThe bacteria fits like a Lego piece onto the surface of immune cells. \nThis starts a chain reaction inside the immune cells, causing them to release molecules that can kill cancer. \nThe next steps will be to see if this method is safe and whether it could be used to help patients. \nWe’re funding similar research using viruses to help the immune system recognise cancer cells as a threat so it can destroy them, opening potential new ways to treat the disease.
