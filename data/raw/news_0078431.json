(Pardeep Pandit/HT Photo) \nThe Aam Aadmi Party’s chief spokesperson Sukhpal Khaira demanded a ban on the student wing of the RSS, Akhil Bhartiya Vidarthi Parishad (ABVP), for creating tension in education institutions in the name of nationalism on Monday. \nAddressing a press conference here, Khaira said, “The ABVP, under a well-planned strategy of the RSS and the BJP, wants to implement its ideological agenda in the name of nationalism.” \n“It is a matter of grave concern. Be it Rohit Vemula issue or the tension created at Delhi University, ABVP is playing with fire and wants to force its agenda under the complete shelter of the Modi-led central Government,” said Khaira. \nThe AAP leader said, “ABVP should be banned in the country immediately so that peace can prevail in educational institutions so that there is no harm for the students who are not falling in line of the student wing of the RSS.” Khaira also demanded from the police to provide full proof security cover for the Jalandhar based girl Gurmehar Kaur, who allegedly has faced rape threats for launching campaign against the ABVP. \n“Not only Gurmehar, but her family should also be provided police cover as the ABVP goons can go to any extent to harm voices speaking against them,” said Khaira. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:06:39.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
