They have got all kinds of strengths, but I just decided that I'd look for a little easier game.\" \nBuffett made the remarks after Berkshire Hathaway sold off $900 million of Walmart stock, and instead invested billions in airlines. \n\"I think retailing is just too tough or me, just generally,\" Buffett said. \"We bought a department store in 1966 and I got my head handed to me. I've been in various things in retailing... I bought Tesco over in the UK and got my head handed to me. Retailing is very tough and I think the online thing is hard to figure out.\" Get the latest Walmart stock price here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T18:54:56.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
