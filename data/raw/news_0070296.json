While there is some shared Northwest flavor between the two, there are also plenty of differences that make these two rainy metropolises unique from one another. Whether you’re looking at living in Seattle or Portland, or taking a trip to one of these cities, understand what makes each city unique—from rainfall amounts, to cost of living, to transportation. Seattle. Bryan Mullennix/Getty Images Seattle vs Portland in General \nWhile neither city is particularly formal, Portland has a slightly more laid-back vibe than Seattle. For some undefined reason, Portland feels a bit friendlier than Seattle, too. Stroll through either city and you’ll find people are generally polite, helpful and approachable, but you’ll get that feeling just a little bit more in Portland than Seattle. Portland has a reputation for being weird (look for a large Keep Portland Weird mural near VooDoo Doughnuts), but Seattle has plenty of weird going on, too. Seattle just doesn’t seem to advertise its weird so blatantly. \ncontinue reading below our video Best Ride Sharing Apps of 2015 Portland. David Gn Photography/Getty Images Population \nSeattle Population as of 2012: 684,450 ( source ) Portland population as of 2011: 632,300 ( source ). \nPortland is slightly smaller than Seattle. While both cities have suburbs and other cities nearby, Seattle's metropolitan area is larger with other cities like Bellevue and Tacoma not far off. The result is one long metro area along the Puget Sound while Portland feels a little more suburban on its outskirts. Amazon.com's Seattle Campus. Joel Rogers/Getty Images Average Salary \nAccording to Payscale.com, Seattle and Portland are in similar neighborhoods as far as average salaries go. Both cities have a full range of major companies from Boeing to Nike, as well as many start-ups and indie businesses working to create a dynamic employment scene. Seattle is home to major Fortune 500 companies like Amazon, Paccar and Microsoft. Portland is host to a vibrant food truck scene. Grant Faint/Getty Images Food \nThe Northwest is a foodie kind of place in general and both Seattle and Portland have thriving culinary scenes. You'll find less five-star elegance and more creative, fresh, local creations that run the gamut from food trucks to fancy in both cities. Special standouts on the culinary scene include Portland's food trucks (there are many!) and Seattle's Pike Place Market , which is filled not only with farm-fresh produce, but also restaurants of all stripes.

Seattle is located on the shores of Puget Sound (Elliott Bay to be exact), but also includes the shorelines of Lake Washington, Lake Union and Green Lake. Portland is on both sides of the Willamette River and the Columbia River isn’t too far away. \nBoth cities count large mountains as part of their scenery on sunny days. Mt. Rainier is visible from many parts of Seattle and is just 54 miles away. Likewise, Mt. Hood is just 50 miles from Portland. Mt. Rainier wins for height between the two mountains at 14,411 feet high to Mt. Hood’s 11,249 feet. \nBoth cities have great parks systems, but Portland’s massive Forest Park has Seattle’s Discovery Park beaten for sheer size and wild appeal—but Forest Park doesn’t have a lighthouse with a view of a mountain and the Puget Sound! Residents and visitors of both cities will face no shortage of green spaces for urban hikes, places to walk the dog or just kick back on a park bench. Craig Tuttle/Getty Images Transportation and Driving \nSeattle and Portland both offer fairly extensive public transportation networks. In Seattle, look to the Metro buses for the best access to all areas of King County. Buses are supplemented by the monorail that runs between SeaTac International Airport and downtown Seattle, as well as from Westlake to Seattle Center. Buses also link Seattle with Tacoma to the south, and cities north such as Everett and Edmonds. Seattle’s buses are easy to use and safe to ride. \nPortland’s public transportation system wins against Seattle’s hands down. Portland’s TriMet system integrates buses with MAX Light Rail and streetcars. MAX lines run out to surrounding areas, including Beaverton, Hillsboro, Gresham and Portland International Airport. The Streetcar expands coverage to OMSI, Lloyd Center, Pearl District and the South Waterfront area. Bus lines cover all these areas and more. \nDriving in both cities can be a bit frustrating to newcomers or visitors, especially in downtown areas. Expect congestion during rush hours as well as a dense street network with plenty of one-way streets to watch out for. Stuart Westmorland/Getty Images Things to Do \nSeattle and Portland offer different, but equally as awesome attractions for residents and tourists alike. Both have a fair lineup of museums, including large art museums in each city. To meet Seattle’s Pike Place Market , Portland offers the Saturday Market. Portland’s Pioneer Courthouse Square is known as the city’s living room and can be a great place to hang out with a cup of coffee and check out whatever is going on for the day. Seattle’s Pioneer Square is not quite as inviting, but areas of Seattle Center can offer a similar experience. Michael Kittell/Getty Images Weather and Average Rainfall \nThe Northwest in general is known for its rain, but residents of the area often like to say either Seattle or Portland gets more rain per year. Most people who casually speak on the subject don’t actually seem to know. The truth is that both Seattle and Portland get about the same amount of rainfall each year—37 inches on average. Both cities have plenty of cloudy days as well, meaning that it can be really tricky to pin down exactly how often you’ll see the sun. Stats about how many sunny days might not count partially sunny days, or sun breaks on cloudy days—but if you live in the area long enough, you’ll be plenty happy over a sun break for an hour or two in the middle of winter!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:08:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
