PwC Partner Brian Cullinan mistakenly handed the back-up envelope for Actress in a Leading Role instead of the envelope for Best Picture to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway.” \nThey added, “Once the error occurred, protocols for correcting it were not followed through quickly enough by Mr. Cullinan or his partner.” \nRELATED VIDEO: Moonlight Wins Best Picture \nThe company also apologized not just to the folks behind Moonlight and La La Land , but to “Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, Jimmy Kimmel, ABC, and the Academy, none of whom was at fault for last night’s errors.” \nThey concluded by saying, “We wish to extend our deepest gratitude to each of them for the graciousness they displayed during such a difficult moment. For the past 83 years, the Academy has entrusted PwC with the integrity of the awards process during the ceremony, and last night we failed the Academy.” \nTim Ryan, U.S. chairman and senior partner at PwC, says he has spoken at length with Cullinan about the incident, saying, “He feels very, very terrible and horrible. He is very upset about this mistake. And it is also my mistake, our mistake, and we all feel very bad,” Ryan told Variety . \nAccording to Deadline , a PwC exec was scheduled to appear on Anderson Cooper 360 on Monday night, but canceled just before the show.
