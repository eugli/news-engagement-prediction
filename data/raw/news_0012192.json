Judge James Robart, of the Federal District Court in Seattle, had ruled that the order caused immediate and irreparable harm in education, business, family relations and the freedom to travel. \nThe document, filed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, emphasizes the value of immigrants to business and society, crediting them with making some of the nation’s “greatest discoveries” and creating among the “most innovative and iconic companies.” Scores of tech businesses, as well yogurt company Chobani and clothing manufacturer LeviStrauss, also joined the lineup. \n“Immigrants are among our leading entrepreneurs, politicians, artists and philanthropists,” the brief states. “The experience and energy of people who come to our country to seek a better life for themselves and their children — to pursue the ‘American Dream’ — are woven throughout the social political and economic fabric of the Nation.’ \nThe brief also recognizes the importance of national security but maintains that a blanket immigration ban isn’t the way to do it. The restrictions, the companies said, would undoubtedly be bad for business. \n“The Order makes it more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to recruit, hire, and retain some of the world’s best employees,” they wrote, noting that “American workers and the economy will suffer as a result.” \nExecutives from some of the biggest tech companies have been vocally outspoken about Trump’s executive order. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said that restrictions “defy the heart and values that define the best of our nation. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said “this executive order is one we do not support” and vowed to help any employees affected by it. Following backlash from both users and drivers concerned about the new policies, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick last week quit the president’s economic advisory council. \nSunday’s letter follows the San Fransisco court’s decision a day earlier to deny a Justice Department request to immediately restore the ban. The appeals court is now preparing to hear full arguments from both sides. \nTrump angrily tweeted throughout the weekend about the decisions, calling Robart a “so-called judge” who would be responsible for any terrorist attacks against the country. He claimed “bad people” were “pouring in,” even though refugees or travelers with visas from the targeted nations typically undergo a lengthy vetting process . \nA brief from the Justice Department is expected to be filed Monday. There was no immediate response from the White House to the amicus brief filing The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! — Donald J.
