For the past few weeks, Democrats have held DNC Future Forums across the country to campaign for the next chair.\nThese forums feel far removed from the energy of the women’s marches and immigration ban protests erupting in the streets. Especially because the front-runners for the next chair of the DNC were all absent from the women’s marches.
