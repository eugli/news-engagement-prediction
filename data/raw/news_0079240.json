It’s having a huge impact on my mental health and I constantly worry that I won’t ever find a donor.”\nAcross the UK there are around 6,500 people, including 150 kids, living in limbo, waiting for a call that will change their lives. Three people a day die waiting for an op.\nBacking our campaign, Labour MP Paul Flynn presented a private Organ Donation Bill in the ­Commons. It is scheduled for its second reading on March 24.\nDr Chisholm added: “If we have an opportunity to address the chronic shortage of organs and save the lives of patients across the UK, surely we should be taking it.”\nSign our petition at mirror.co.uk/donor .
