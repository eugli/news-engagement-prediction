He also confirmed that others connected to the NGO also had their statements recorded. \n“Police are trying to get as much information as possible for some leads,” he said. \nPolice have since formed a special task force to investigate the case relating to the missing pastor. \nInspector-general of police Khalid Abu Bakar said the task force was led by Selangor CID chief Fadzil Ahmat. \nThe pastor was believed to have been abducted by several individuals while driving alone on Jalan Bahagia, Petaling Jaya, on Feb 14. \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:51:11.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
