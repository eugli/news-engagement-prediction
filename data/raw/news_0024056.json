It's ridiculous enough to not matter. \nThe competitors line up, shivering in the cold and wind of a summer's day in Warrnambool at 8am. \nMany of them are traditionally not competitive runners, with some charging up on a bacon and egg breakfast moments before racing. \nThe Undy 500 and associated big breakfast is held at the centre of town, on Leibig Street, the main street. \nIt launches the Wunta Fiesta which is about celebrating everything local in Warrnambool â€” including the locals themselves, and their underwear. \nThanks to ABC Open contributors Rhonda McDonnell and Rosana Sialong who filmed most of the action shots in this film and also, thanks to backup photographers Karen O'Brien and Carol Jenkins.
