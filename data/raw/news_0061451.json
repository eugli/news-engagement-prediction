Always. All of them are at least fine, and that even includes this one. But there are some holes in this rebuttal to Draymond Green's slander of Pierce that need to be discussed: \n1. Most of the players on the Warriors have exactly as many championship rings as Paul Pierce: one. \n2. Pierce's current teammates, the Clippers, blew a 3-1 lead in a playoff series against the Rockets two years ago. Pierce wasn't on that team, but still. \n3. The Clippers think they're going to win the title every year. That's why they keep focusing all their energy on building for the present in a way that has gutted their future. And they've never won a title, ever. \n4. Since Pierce joined his hometown's other team, the Clippers are 0-7 against the Warriors. They haven't won at Oracle Arena since 2011 . Is team success really the direction to go here? \nPierce could have made this so much more vicious by going after Green personally, as Green did with him. Green was wrong to say no one cares about Pierce, and he left himself open for something harsher than a 2 a.m. Pacific time tweet of a standard internet joke. \nGet dirty. Bring up Game 4. Bring up LeBron James. That would have been the real punch to the groin.
