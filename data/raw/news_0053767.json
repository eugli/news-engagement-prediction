Rescuers steered boats carrying dozens of people, some with babies and pets, from a San Jose neighborhood inundated by water from an overflowing creek Tuesday. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press) Liam Dillon said at a news conference that the water flow into Lake Oroville peaked Tuesday morning, which may give engineers a chance to temporarily close the main spillway and get their clearest look yet at the 3,000-foot-long concrete structure's damage .\nEstimates have put repairs of the spillway at $100 million or more, but Croyle said it was too early to tell. \n\"Do we repair what we have? Do we replace what we have? Do we build the spillway somewhere else? All options are on the table,\" said Croyle, who declined to provide a timetable for the spillway shutoff. If you are protected by a rural levee or levees in the delta, you are not sleeping well. — Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California’s Water Policy Center \nIn San Joaquin County, while the breached-levee bullet was dodged, the emergency provided a warning of how much the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region relies on a system of several thousand levees to keep its residents safe from flooding in extremely wet years. \nRural stretches of San Joaquin County are at the greatest risk. Levees there are made up of dirt, rocks and sand and are designed to hold back water all the time, including during winter storms, said Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California’s Water Policy Center. These levees require constant monitoring to ensure they don’t leak or break, he said. \n“If you are protected by a rural levee or levees in the delta, you are not sleeping well,” Mount said. \nPotential danger from failure in the state’s complex system of levees, which also protect the Sacramento region, has consistently been the subject of political debates. In 2006, state voters approved $4 billion in bonds to help repair levees in the aftermath of catastrophic failures of New Orleans’ levees during Hurricane Katrina. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger made the issue central to his reelection campaign. \nState and federal efforts since then have significantly improved the safety of Sacramento and surrounding environs, Mount said. Sacramento used to be more at risk of flooding due to levee breaches than any other metropolitan area in the country. \n“Not even close anymore,” Mount said. \nBut Mount and other experts argue that substantially more needs to be spent – at least $20 billion – to secure the levee systemin the watershed regions of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, especially with the threat of more dramatic weather patterns due to climate change. \nRobert Bea, a professor emeritus in UC Berkeley’s civil engineering department, calls the state’s current efforts to repair levees in the San Joaquin Delta “patch and pray.” \n“If the process of ‘patch and pray’ for whatever reason doesn’t work and you have a major breach in the levees,” he said, “the consequences of what happens next, as we have proven over and over, is very costly. Hence, you’re gambling. When people’s lives and a large amount of property are involved, I don’t like gambling.” \nIn the northern San Joaquin Valley, state and local officials said they were continuing to monitor the levees while Don Pedro and other reservoirs upstream continued to work to spill off the water generated by the wet winter. \n“There’s a variety of sites we’re keeping our eyes on,” said Jon Ericson, chief of the hydrology and flood operations office at the state Department of Water Resources. \nStaff writers Peter H.
