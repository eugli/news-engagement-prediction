However, we're completely fine with the M.A.C. Basic Bitch Palette. Over the past couple years, those two words have come to define someone who likes the cozier—and more ubiquitous—things in life like PSLs and Ugg. In the case of M.A.C's newest palette, they mean essential eye shadows for creating go-to looks. Uh, we can't hate M.A.C. for giving the people what they want, right? One of the company's senior makeup artists, Netta Szekely, revealed the new palette of all new shades and textures that she's been testing out backstage at Milan Fashion Week . (Szekely worked backstage at shows like Alberta Ferretti and Luisa Beccaria, although she didn't reveal if the palette was in play for either of those presentations.) It's one of many products M.A.C.'s MUAs have been experimenting with during Fashion Month. Last week, we told you about the pizza cutter eyeliner . (You can see it in action here .) And now, we're all about this nine-shade M.A.C. Basic Bitch Palette. It includes every shimmery and smoldering shade you could need for a standard smoky eye and several neutrals for a low-key no-makeup makeup look. It's basically M.A.C.'s version of all the Naked Palettes combined. (TBH those pups are total basic bitch staples in the best possible way.)
