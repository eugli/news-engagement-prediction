Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDiego Costa has paid tribute to Chelsea legend Didier Drogba for inspiring his goal spree with the league leaders . \nCosta smashed 20 goals two seasons ago to shoot the Blues to title success following his £32million move from Atletico Madrid. \nDrogba, voted Chelsea’s greatest player by supporters five years ago, was at the club during Costa’s first season. \nThe Ivory Coast striker, who clinched 12 major trophies at Stamford Bridge, was back last weekend to see Costa help crush Arsenal and keep the club nine points clear at the top of the table.

Just seeing him, I was amazed. This is because — and I’m not making this up at all — I specifically used to watch Chelsea [before he joined], who are obviously a big club, just to see Drogba. \n\"He was famous and everyone would talk about him. I even liked watching him when he played for the Ivory Coast. \n“When I arrived here, he was never cold with me, quite the opposite. I wasn’t exactly scared of him, but he was such a legend who had helped the club grow and been a part of all that. \n“He made history here, so could have been dismissive of me but, no, he was always fantastic with me. I will always have fond memories of him and whenever I see him, I thank him. It’s not always easy for someone with so much history to be in that position.

I take my hat off to him.” \nCosta has also revealed his street-fighter nature comes from the battles he has had back in his homeland. \nHe said: “Perhaps you could say it comes from when I used to play in the streets [back in Brazil], playing alongside my brother and cousins. \n“I always wanted to win. Everyone has a bit of that in them, but I have even more of a will to win. Sometimes I might go overboard, whereas there are others who, yes, they want to win, but if they don’t it’s no big deal for them. \n“I’m different. I want to win and always have done since I was small. I don’t know if it’s in my blood or just my personality.” poll loading Will Diego Costa win the Golden Boot? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:01:51.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
