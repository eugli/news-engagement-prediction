They all had career-high ratings of 938. \nThe highest possible rating a player can receive is 1000. \nSitting atop the ICC’s Test batting rankings, Smith now has a 66-point buffer on second-placed Virat Kohli (873), who lost 22 points after making scores of 0 and 13 during India’s 333-run defeat. England’s Joe Root (848), New Zealand’s Kane Williamson (823) and Australia’s David Warner (805) round out the top five. \nTake a look at the stunning stats that have powered Smith to his career-high rating and how Australia’s other players fared in the latest rankings. Steve Smith has the sixth highest rating of any batsman in history. Source: AP \nBEHIND ONLY THE DON AND SUNNY \nSmith has racked up the third most runs (4888 runs at 60.34) of any player in their first 51 Tests, behind only Bradman (6996) and India’s Sunil Gavaskar (4997). \nBradman (29) and Gavaskar (20) are also the only players to have scored more centuries in their first 51 Tests. Smith sits equal third with Matthew Hayden on 18. \nHis average of 60.34 is the fourth best of any player after 51 Tests, behind Bradman (101.39), Herbert Sutcliffe (62.67) and Jack Hobbs (60.47). \nCHASING DOWN MR CRICKET AND TUBBY \nSmith’s century on Saturday drew him level with David Warner on 18 Test hundreds. The pair now sit equal 14th among Australian century makers, just behind Mark Taylor (19) and Mike Hussey (19). \nYet to turn 28, Smith has already overtaken some of Australia’s greatest ever players, with Adam Gilchrist (17), Doug Walters (15), Ian Chappell (14) and Bill Lawry (13) all in his rear view mirror. \nONE AWAY FROM COMPLETING THE SET \nSmith’s critics often point to his lofty average of 60.34 being the result of Australia’s batter friendly tracks. That seems a harsh criticism considering where Smith has scored his centuries. \nSmith has now scored Test hundreds in seven of the eight countries he has played in, with tons in Australia (10), England (three), India (one), New Zealand (one), South Africa (one), Sri Lanka (one) and the West Indies (one). \nThe only country he has toured without scoring a century in is the United Arab Emirates, where he has a top score of 97. \nWhat’s more he averages above 40 in every country he has played in, with his lowest average in a nation being 41.16 in Sri Lanka. Smith puts 100 past India 0:38 \nHE LOVES INDIA \nFew have enjoyed as much success against India as Smith. \nIn his ninth Test against the cricketing powerhouse, the 27-year-old passed his 1000th run against India. \nAnd his average — which stands at 88.83 after being dismissed for 109 — is the third best of anyone to have passed the 1000-run mark against India. \nOnly West Indian legend Sir Everton Weekes (1495 runs at 106.78), and Zimbabwean champion Andy Flower (1138 at 94.83) sit ahead of him. \nSome may put Smith’s dominance over India down to massive contributions on placid home wickets. \nBut what can’t be denied is his more than handy average of 49.50 in India — with a century in just three Tests. \nSmith has also achieved something neither Weekes nor Flower pulled off, becoming the first player to ever score centuries in five consecutive Tests against India. \nHAZLEWOOD UP TO SECOND \nDespite only bowling nine overs during Australia’s 333-run win, Josh Hazlewood has moved up to second on the Test bowler rankings, tied with India’s Ravindra Jadeja (860). Hazlewood has never had a higher rating or better ranking. \nUnsurprisingly, Steve O’Keefe was Australia’s biggest mover on the rankings, shooting up 33 spots to 29th after his 12-wicket haul in Pune. Matt Renshaw moved up 18 spots from 52nd to 34th. Smith's lucky escapes 0:30 \nIndia’s Ravi Ashwin remains atop the Test bowling (878) and all-rounder (448) rankings. \nArguably the biggest surprise from the latest rankings was Mitchell Starc’s rise to fourth on the all-rounder rankings, with a career-high rating of 347. Starc is ahead of England’s Ben Stokes (327), and behind Jadeja (372) and Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan (441). \nStarc sat seventh among all-rounders before the series.
