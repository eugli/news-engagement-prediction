(Source: Screenshot) \nIn a disgusting act, a priest from Kerala said that women who wear jeans, t-shirt, shirt or any other clothes that are primarily meant for men, should be drowned in the sea. His shameful comments did not end here and the pastor was recorded saying women do these things just to arouse men. A girl named Jasmine PK exposed the priest by sharing a video on Facebook in which he is saying that women wearing men’s attire should be drowned in the sea with rocks tied to their bodies. “When I go for prayer meetings in some churches, especially during the Holy Mass, I feel like leaving because of some women who I see in front of me. I feel it’s better to kick them out of the church premises,” he said. \nHe said women do all these things just to get attention, even when a place like church don’t require it. “They will wear jeans, trousers, shirt or T-shirts, and will have a mobile phone in their hands. They wouldn’t even tie their hair. They do this get attention. I don’t know why these things come to the church,” he added. The video was taken from Shalom TV but was originally posted about 12 months ago on YouTube. \nYou can watch the whole video here: \nHe further added, “Did the Catholica Church give you permission to wear what men wear?” Okay, let’s keep the church away. Did the Holy Bible give you permission? Let me tell you what the Bible says, Men should not wear women’s clothes, women should not wear men’s clothes. If you do, you disregard god. Will you get mercy if you go against god and then act in the church as if you’re more devoted than your mother?” \nHe complained that many boys come to him and tell that women wearing half-nude clothes in church arouse them to sin. “Those who provoke you into sin should be drowned in the depths of the sea, with a rock tied to their bodies. If you [women] arouse men, you’re the sinner. The best-suited attire for women is ‘churidaar’, but these days, when Satan enters them, women throw away the ‘dupatta’. They walk around without shawls.” Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:08:21.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
