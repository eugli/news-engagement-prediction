Photograph: Joel Saget/AFP/Getty Images View more sharing options Neil Bartlett Wednesday 1 February 2017 12.00 GMT \nT his arresting autobiographical novel pulls no punches; rather, it lands them on the reader as frequently as fists descend on its subject. The Eddy of the title is a child born to below-the-poverty-line parents in an isolated village in rural northern France in 1992. According to the cover, 24-year-old author Édouard Louis was himself born in Picardy, in 1992, but the information is unnecessary; although Édouard’s editing of his own childhood into Eddy’s creates a deeply disconcerting sense that the horror we witness is merely the tip of the iceberg, we are never in any doubt that only real life could be this bleak. Starting in closeup, with 10-year-old Eddy being assaulted in a primary school corridor, the narrative presents us with a compelling series of snapshots of a family and community where daily life is structured by working-class rage, male violence and alcohol. For an effeminate boy like Eddy, this world creates a perfect storm; his survival is not just in doubt, but simply impossible. \nFrom his earliest childhood, Eddy exhibits all the classic symptoms of his stigmatised condition; his hands over-gesture, his voice is too high and he instinctively loathes the food, sexuality and clothes of his peers. In consequence, he is beaten, abused and terrorised. As a “faggot” or “homo” he is the lowest of the low; lower than women, lower than even an Arab, Jew or Algerian – everyone in the book, young Eddy included, is casually racist. Nothing equips him to protect himself from the shame and terror that are his constant companions, and – not surprisingly – he lives and breathes unqualified self-loathing. He makes repeated attempts to assume the proper masculine role that his culture requires of him, and every time he fails, he assumes the fault is entirely his. \nSo far, so grim. For anyone who thinks that in contemporary Europe the bad old days are far behind us for young people like Eddy, this is a salutary reminder of just how far from the truth that is. Since it was published in France in 2014, the book has reached more than 300,000 readers and been translated into 20 different languages. Indeed, the reception of Eddy’s storypoints to just how hungry people are to understand the persistent hatred of the sexually stigmatised, a hatred that can so easily resurface as economic and cultural conflicts escalate. However, the real achievement of the book is not its reportage, but its attitude. It is written entirely without self pity – and, astonishingly, without judgment. \nEddy/Édouard apportions no blame to his parents, schoolmates or neighbours for their negligence or brutality; they are shown as being themselves as much victims as perpetrators. Their homophobia, misogyny, addictions, cruelty, racism and violence are all unflinchingly presented as intersecting consequences of deprivation and ignorance, and it’s with good reason the book is dedicated to leading French philosopher and radical social theorist Didier Eribon. The writing is often shockingly deadpan; where it falters, it does so only with compassion or tact. There are sudden shafts of tenderness – often directed at Eddy’s maimed and maiming father– and when he tells you that some passages were written at the cost of tears, you believe him. There is no recoil from the facts, but no sentiment either. In the end, the writing-out of this intolerable childhood comes across as courageous, necessary and deeply touching. \nThe ending of the story is strange, fractured and brilliant, especially the audaciously suspended moment – which reminded me of the unforgettable freeze-frame at the end of Truffaut’s Les Quatre Cents Coup s – as he leaps out of his childhood into the possibility of salvation. Like so much of the book, this section has both a documentary exactitude and a surreal oddity. It sends the reader stumbling away with a head full of questions. Just how, exactly, did that traumatised child become the assured and beautiful young man who gazes so calmly from the author photo on the book jacket? Whom did he meet, once he had escaped to the city, and how? Who was it who helped him save and repossess his life – and who inspired him to write this well? All that, I hope, is for another book. I’d love to read it. \n• Neil Bartlett’s latest novel, The Disappearance Boy , is published by Bloomsbury. The End of Eddy is published by Harvill Secker.
