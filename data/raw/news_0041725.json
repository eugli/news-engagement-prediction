Jay Nixon. The photo was provided by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. Jay Nixon State Park is closed 1 month after it was opened 18 hrs ago ( … ) \nMissouri's newest state park will be named after Gov. Jay Nixon. The photo was provided by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. \nJEFFERSON CITY • Just a month after it opened under mysterious circumstances, Missouri’s newest state park has been closed. \nThe Missouri Department of Natural Resources confirmed Wednesday that Jay Nixon State Park in Reynolds County was shuttered on Feb. 8 due to “potential public safety concerns.” \nThe closure is the latest twist in a controversy that caught fire in the waning days of Nixon’s final days as governor. \nNixon, a Democrat, championed the state park system during his two terms in office, arguing that an expansion will help draw tourism spending to the state. In the weeks before he left office, Nixon oversaw the opening of four parks and said visitors to the state topped 20 million in 2016. \nAs a parting gift before he re-entered the private sector as an attorney at a Clayton law firm, the DNR quietly announced that a mostly undeveloped 1,200-acre tract of land near Ironton would carry Nixon’s name. \nThat move, however, has angered local lawmakers, sparked legislation to strip Nixon’s name off the park and was cited as a potential factor in the ouster of the state’s park director. \nAnd, now, the remote facility is closed. \n“The status of Jay Nixon State Park was re-evaluated due to limited access and lack of facilities,” DNR spokesman Tom Bastian wrote in an email to the Post-Dispatch Wednesday. \nOn Wednesday, a House committee heard debate on a plan to rename the park as Proffitt Mountain State Park in honor of pioneers who settled the area, which abuts Taum Sauk State Park and Johnson’s Shut-Ins State Park. \nRep. Paul Fitzwater, R-Potosi, suggested the change, saying it fits the region better than a park named after Nixon. \n“I don’t have anything against naming something after the governor,” Fitzwater said. \n“I appreciate his many years of service as governor and attorney general.” \nBut, “This parcel of land, and the history behind this parcel of land, is why we’re trying to do this,” he added. \nThe son of a man who was murdered in connection also said he supported the renaming of the park. Troy Jones, 48, told the committee that a former owner of the property had killed his father over a disagreement over an easement on the property. \nJones’ family had originally sought to have the park named after their late patriarch. \nRep. Sonya Anderson, R-Springfield, told the committee that she also had heard the park was currently inaccessible. \n“It’s not in any condition to hike,” Anderson said. \nContacted at his new job Wednesday, Nixon declined to comment.
