It's 160 miles of sales. That spans most of the state: from around Beebe to Fort Smith. It takes a few days to really shop the whole sale. \nHowever, it's not just your average yard sale. You'll find your average yard sale trash to treasures, but you'll also find antiques, new items, collectibles and more. Many people sell handmade furniture or art along the route. You can even find produce. Even if you're not a flea market or yard sale person, you can probably find something you want if you're persistent enough. \nEven if you don't find that great bargain, the sale runs through some of the most scenic places in Arkansas. You'll pass lots of scenic vistas and some great tourist attractions. Be sure to plan some time to take advantage of those too. \nDates and Hours: \nAugust 11th - 13th, 2016Generally, the sales are open from sun up to sun down. However, like most garage sales, it varies by vendor. \ncontinue reading below our video Beware! The 5 Most Common Travel Scams \nWhere: \nThis sale takes place all along US 64 in Arkansas. It starts in Fort Smith , hits Van Buren, Alma, Ozark, Altus , Clarksville, Russellville, Morrilton, Conway, Vilonia and Beebe. Overall, 24 cities participate, including Atkins, El Paso, Menifee, Blackwell, Hartman, Mulberry, Coal Hill, Knoxville, Plummerville, Dyer, Lamar, Pottsville and London. \nMany ask where the \"best place\" to shop is, but it really is a huge sale. You'll find great buys along any part of it. It would be hard to say where the best place to shop was unless you knew exactly what you were looking for, and even then two vendors at opposite sides of the sale might both be selling the items. \nCheck out the Arkansas travel guide and quirky roadside attraction guide to find some can't miss stops along the way. \nSafety: \nBecause of the nature of this sale and the highway, it can be a little dangerous. Use your turn signals when you want to pull over and don't make any U-turns or sudden stops. You can always turn around and go back. Remember, people who aren't visiting the sale are also using the highway. \nYou should also be aware of following to close, because not everyone will be polite enough to use turn signals and some will stop suddenly. Drive slower than the speed limit. All the sudden stopping and going can cause fender benders (or worse). \nBe careful while crossing the street. Some people will not stop for you. Be sure to hold on to children and animals. \nTips: \nThere are some participants off the highway. Look for signs. There are also food vendors along the route, but many find packing a lunch to be a good option. Wear comfortable shoes. You should also be prepared for the heat. August in Arkansas is pretty hot. Bring water and wear cool clothes. Take small bills and change so you don't have to wait for change to move on to your next find. \nI'm told that Friday is the best day to hit the sale. It starts on a Thursday, but every vendor is not outside then. Friday has more vendors and it's not quite picked over yet. Be sure to bring cash. These days, most vendors have some sort of mobile credit card processing company, but not all of them do. I also find vendors will give better deals to cash purchases, because they don't have to pay the credit card processing fees. When making an offer, be sure you tell them you intend to pay with cash. \nYard sale shopping tips that work everywhere else will work at this sale too. Some of the vendors are just families, but some are professional flea market vendors. Be sure to take your flea market strategy too .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:57:02.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
