Cat owners are hotter than people who have rabbits, or snakes, or even lovebirds. \nAnd they are definitely, indisputably hotter than dog owners. \nIf you disagree, you are wrong. And I will fight you. \nHere are just a few reasons why. (Picture: Getty) 1. Cat owners smell better \nLook, I love dogs, but they are significantly more likely to smell than cats. \nWet dog smell. Unwashed dog smell. Dog breath. \nWhen you live with that many smells, you’re going to pick up a bit of an odour too. Sorry, dog owners. But you aren’t smelling fresh. 2. Dog people like needy, over-enthusiastic beings \nOh, you prefer a pet who’s always keen for your attention, never turns you down, and will be there for you whenever you need them? \nYou’re probably expecting the same from a partner. Not into it. 3. Whereas cat people admire independence \nCat owners understand that sometimes the person/cat you love needs a little space. And they’re okay with that. (Picture: Getty) 4. Cat people know that sometimes you have to work to earn people’s love \nCats don’t give away their affection to just anyone. They’re tough to please. They take a while to warm up. \nCat people don’t get needy or annoying when you’re a little distanced. They just take it in their stride and wait patiently for you to come around. 5. Cat owners are incredibly patient \nAnyone who owns a cat will have had to deal with their cat meowing at the door then refusing to get out. They’ll have had to sit perfectly still while needing to pee because their cat has sat on their lap. They’ve slowly twitched a toy mouse for hours on end. \nThat kind of patience and stamina is HOT. 6. They know how to stroke a pussy \nImportant. 7. Cat owners are gentle snugglers \nNo aggressive patting motions here. Just slow strokes and chin tickles. What a delight. (Picture: Getty) 8. Dog owners like being outside. In the park. \nCat people are indoor people. They’re snoozing on the sofa people. They’re reading in bed people. \nThey are the best kind of people. 9. A cat owner will never talk to you like you are very, very dumb \nEver noticed that dog owners talk to their dogs like they’re f***ing idiots? ‘Who’s a good boy?’ WHAT ANSWER ARE YOU EXPECTING, DOG PEOPLE? \nCat owners, meanwhile, will chat with their cats like their equals.
