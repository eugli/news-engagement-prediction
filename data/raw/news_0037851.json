The agenda included political developments on both sides: the EU global strategy, trade and investment - including everything but arms - and other issues of bilateral importance.\nIrregular migration \nIrregular migration refers to the illegal movement of people to work in a country without authorisation to work. However, according to the International Organisation for Migration, there is no clear or universally accepted definition of the term. \nThe issue came to fore in Dhaka in 2O15 when thousands of Bangladeshis have been found in the queue of middle-eastern countries’ refugees who entered Europe fleeing war. \nThe EU has been facing the biggest migration challenge since World War II, mainly due to the wars in Syria and Libya. \nBut the 28-countries bloc has been insisting Dhaka start the process to take back the Bangladeshis who they have labelled as “economic migrants”. Dhaka was also informed last year that there were 80,000 such Bangladeshi nationals staying illegally in various European countries.\nThe EU also offered cooperation in this process, which includes “a special program for reintegration of returnees”. \nIntensifying cooperation \nMatters of regional and global interest where the EU and Bangladesh can “intensify collaboration”, such as connectivity, migration, peace and security, terrorism, Agenda 2030, were also discussed, according to the joint statement. \nThe EU and Bangladesh also agreed to intensify cooperation on HORIZON 2020 and jointly explore new areas for cooperation such as science, technology, and innovation, space issues. \nBoth sides recognised “the importance of ongoing people-to-people contacts, including under the ERASMUS programme, and emphasised on the need to jointly explore new avenues for such contacts which could, among other things, be of particular benefit to youth”. \nBoth parties also agreed to work on the common agenda “with a view to reaching concrete progress and deliverables, which will be reviewed in the course of the next consultations, to be held in Dhaka in 2018”. \nThe meeting was held in “a constructive and cordial atmosphere”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:58:54.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
