While there are collaborative activities, there are also some friction points. \n\n\"The idea is that through the mechanism of this strategic dialogue, the foreign secretary from our side and his Chinese counterpart can take a holistic view of India-China relations and see to what extent the two sides can accommodate each other's concerns and interests,\" he said. \n\nMaintaining that the upcoming Strategic Dialogue, which was set up during the visit of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in August last year, was a new mechanism, Swarup said it is a more \"comprehensive\" forum. \n\nIndia-China ties have witnessed strain following Beijing's rigid stand on issues crucial to India such as membership to the Nuclear Suppliers Group and designation of JeM chief and Pathankot attack mastermind Masood Azhar as global terrorist by the UN. \n\nNot only China scuttled India's membership bid at the meeting of NSG last year, it also opposed banning of Azhar by the UN, apparently at the behest of its \"all-weather\" friend Pakistan. \n\nYesterday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry also said it has lodged a protest with India for hosting a Taiwanese parliamentary delegation and asked it to deal \"prudently\" with Taiwan-related matters. New Delhi dismissed the protest saying no \"political meanings\" should be read into such trips.
