Malaysian authorities want to question a North Korean diplomat in connection with the you-couldn't-make-this-up bizarre murder of the estranged half-brother of North Korea's leader . In Holland, an extreme critic of Islam is leading polls ahead of next month's election. And in Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May will soon begin the contentious process of leaving the European Union. \nBut in Iceland, President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson was forced to clarify his views late Tuesday on, uh, well, pineapple and pizza. (Although ham was not mentioned, needed to complete the \"Hawaiian.\") \n\"I like pineapples, just not on Pizza. I do not have the power to make laws that forbid people to put pineapples on their pizza,\" Jóhannesson wrote in a Facebook post. \n\"Presidents should not have unlimited power. I would not want to hold this position if I could pass laws forbidding that which I don't like. I would not want to live in such a country.\" \nThe high-stakes diplomatic climb down came after Jóhannesson responded to a question from a student last week who had asked him what he thought of the love-it-or-hate-it pizza topping. Jóhannesson held nothing back. He said he found the pairing completely disgusting and would have it banned nationwide if he could. Icelanders obsessed with mysterious death of young woman \nBut to the delight of \"Hawaiian\" pizza lovers everywhere, the combination of tomato sauce, cheese, ham and pineapple now appears, for now, to be safe in Iceland. \nJóhannesson, at 48 Iceland's youngest ever president, took office in August. He previously worked as an academic specializing in Icelandic history. \n\"For pizzas, I recommend seafood,\" Jóhannesson, who has been spotted picking up pizza on his way home from work, said in the Facebook post.
