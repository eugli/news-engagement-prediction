In a large skillet, cook sausage and sweet potato over medium-high heat 5-7 minutes or until sausage is no longer pink, breaking up sausage into crumbles. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Meanwhile, coat bottom of a 12-in. ovenproof skillet with oil. Reserve 1/2 cup hash browns for topping; add remaining potatoes to skillet, pressing firmly with a spatula to form an even layer. Layer with cheese, kale and corn; top with sausage mixture and reserved hash browns. In a bowl, whisk eggs, cream, salt and pepper until blended; pour over top. Bake, uncovered, 45-55 minutes or until edges are golden brown and egg portion is set. Cover loosely with foil during the last 10 minutes if needed to prevent overbrowning. Let stand 20 minutes before serving. If desired, serve with syrup.
