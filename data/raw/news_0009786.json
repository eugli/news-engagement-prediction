But I couldn't have been more wrong,' she explained.\n'Yesterday he went to Manchester with his grandma for his bloods to be taken. When the results came back, they showed he needed some platelets and a blood transfusion. A blood transfusion? This could be why he's so weak?

'I am fundraising for treatment. I don't want to beg, but he is my son and I have no choice.'\nAmber revealed how Charlie's stomach hardened and his veins became visible beneath his skin, prompting her to take him to Blackburn Royal Hospital where, on February 1, 2016, he was diagnosed with cancer.\nCharlie, described as fun and cheeky, has so far undergone 19 lots of six-day rounds, which is stabilising but not curing him, according to Amber.\n'When he was first diagnosed his AFP levels were around 700,000,' she explained.
