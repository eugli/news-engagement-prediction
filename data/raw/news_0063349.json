This system of shared control is the opposite of \"centralized\" forms of governments, such as those in England and France, under which the national government maintains exclusive power. \nIn the case of the United States, federalism is the sharing of powers between the U.S. federal government and the individual state governments. \nWhile each of the 50 U.S. states has its own constitution, all provisions of the states’ constitutions must comply with the U.S. Constitution. For example, a state constitution cannot deny accused criminals the right to a trial by jury, as assured by the U.S. Constitution's 6th Amendment . \nUnder the U.S. Constitution, certain powers are granted exclusively to either the national government or the state governments, while other powers are shared by both. \nIn general, the Constitution grants those powers needed to deal with issues of overarching national concern exclusively to the U.S. federal government, while the state governments are granted powers to deal with issues pertaining to issues affecting the particular state only. \nAll laws, regulations and policies enacted by the federal government must fall within one of the powers specifically granted to it in the Constitution. For example, the federal government’s powers to levy taxes, mint money, declare war, establish post offices, and punish piracy at sea are all enumerated in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. \nIn addition, the federal government claims the power pass many diverse laws – such as those regulating the sale of guns and tobacco products – under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, granting it the power, “To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” \nBasically, the Commerce Clause allows the federal government to pass laws dealing in any way with the transportation of goods and services between state lines but no power to regulate commerce that takes place entirely within a single state. \nThe extent of the powers granted to the federal government depends on how the pertinent sections of the Constitution are interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court . Where the States Get Their Powers \nThe states draw their powers under our system of federalism from the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, which grants them all powers not specifically granted to the federal government, nor forbidden to them by the Constitution. \nFor example, while the Constitution grants the federal government the power to levy taxes, state and local governments may also levy taxes, because the Constitution does not prohibit them from doing so. In general, state governments have the power to regulated issues of local concern, such as drivers’ licenses, public school policy, and non-federal road construction and maintenance. Exclusive Powers of the National Government \nUnder the Constitution, powers reserved to the national government include: Print money (bills and coins) Declare war Establish an army and navy Enter into treaties with foreign governments Regulate commerce between states and international trade Establish post offices and issue postage Make laws necessary to enforce the Constitution Exclusive Powers of State Governments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:17:38.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
