After the attacks, which went on for several hours, the victim needed in-patient treatment at a trauma clinic and now is under psychiatric care for post traumatic stress disorder. She had another breakdown at the weekend and was too fragile to be in court to face her attackers. Only one man, Mohamed Al-A., 31, admitted his role in the rapes and he sobbed in court as he said he was 'really drunk' on vodka at the time. One of the accused, Mohammed Al T., has a hood covering his face and looks to the ground as he is led in to court His Muslim faith may forbid him to drink alcoholic beverages, but on New Year's Eve he said he made an exception and drank vodka. 'I was really drunk,' he said, and he further admitted; 'this act is a crime in Iraq.' He was with co-defendants Nazar Al-J., Mohammed Al-T. und Alaa Al-J. in the Cactus bar, and the four men are alleged to have taken the victim back to the apartment. The other defendants - Hader Al-A., Mustafa Al-J., Nael Al-J., Marwan Al-J. und Sabah Al-J. - lay in wait for her there, the court was told. Medical experts testified she was raped multiple times and sodomised. The victim said she yelled at them, in German: 'No, I don't want this.' Then in English: 'Listen to me, just a little bit.' Her attackers conversed only in Arabic. Alaa Al-J. was said to be the rape ringleader. After it was over Mohammed Al-. escorted her to a toilet in the flat where he took a selfie with her on his mobile phone. Another suspect, Marwan Al-J, holds his hands to his face as he is led into court in handcuffs Later he and Alaa Al-J. escorted her to a nearby tram stop where they tried to stem her sobbing by saying in English: 'Don't cry.' After she went to police, a tracking app on her mobile phone led officers to the rape scene. The app showed that her ordeal lasted from 4.20am to 6.20am on January 1 2016. The court heard that with the exception of the man who confessed, none of the others have shown remorse. Several denied rape even in the face of the DNA evidence. One man claimed that the woman had been 'offered' to them by relatives: another that she was a willing participant in whatever took place. Judge Poaschalko seemed visibly angered at the shifts in their stories throught Tuesday's hearing. The court resumes again on Thursday and sentencing will be handed down on March 6. She has warned them they face up to 15 years each in jail.
