Ninety. \nIt was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. \nBrilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. \nBeat that, Gaga. 2) BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN'S CROTCH Image copyright Getty Images \nBaby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. \nIn his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: \"Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mike… BOOM! \n\"And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up and… BLAM! BORN TO RUN!\" \nIt led to the memorable headline: \"America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch\" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. 3) BEYONCE GETS POLITICAL Image copyright Getty Images \nColdplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. \nShe only performed one song , Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. \nSome of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. \nThe performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year. 4) DIANA ROSS LEAVES IN STYLE Image copyright Getty Images \nYou can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX. \nShe raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic. 5) THE YEAR WHEN AN ELVIS IMPERSONATOR WAS THE STAR ATTRACTION Image copyright NFL \nFor the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers. \n1987's show was altogether more bizarre. \nA magician named \"Elvis Presto\" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics. \nAt the culmination of the show, the \"Prince of Prestidigitation\" performed an interactive magic trick (\"pick a card, concentrate real hard\") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses. \nIt was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach. 6) KATY PERRY UPSTAGED BY A SHARK Image copyright Getty Images \nShe arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous \"left shark\". \nHe was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves. \nIt quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star. \nAnd when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend. Image copyright Katy Perry 7) NIPPLEGATE Image copyright Getty Images / AP \nPoor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob. \nFew ever believed that the \"wardrobe malfunction\" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press). \nNonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered. \nBut there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online. \nIn response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube. \nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
