The two men walked in the rain to the Fighting Irish's final football news conference of the 2016 season, following the team’s eighth loss. \nAfter the program’s 14th losing season, Kelly vowed to do a full review and make necessary changes. \nBy national signing day on Feb. 1, Notre Dame had seven new coaches and the No. 11 class in the nation, according to 247Sports.com, with 21 commitments . \nThese sweeping changes are one reason Swarbrick, who sat down with IndyStar this week, still thinks Kelly is the right person for this job. Swarbrick's belief was initially shown Oct. 21 when he gave Kelly a vote of confidence in an interview with ESPN . He said Kelly “will lead this team out of the tunnel on opening day next year” and that he has “complete confidence” in his coach. Notre Dame was 2-5 following a loss to Stanford. \nSwarbrick feels the same way four months later. \n“He’s a natural leader,” Swarbrick said. “He has a great sense for the game. He’s a very effective teacher. He relates to our students. There’s a perception based on sideline engagement that he’s not close to the kids, and nothing could be further from the truth. And even more so now coming off a year like last year.” \nSwarbrick gave examples of Kelly standing up in front of his team in the locker room after a loss and apologizing for letting them down. \n“That creates a real bond between a team and a coach,” Swarbrick said. “Probably the thing you have to ask yourself despite all that when you hit hard times is, is this a coach who’s prepared to fully examine the program and make the changes you think need to be made? And that’s one of his great strengths. He’ll look at anything if he thinks it’ll help the team.” \nThere was a lot to unpack after Notre Dame’s final game. Immediately following the news conference where Kelly said he would “absolutely be back” in South Bend next season, reports swirled that he had reached out through representatives to “explore coaching options outside Notre Dame.” \nSwarbrick wasn’t worried. \n“I knew everything about it,” he said, following a deep breath. “I knew what was true and what wasn’t true because, again, Brian and I, it’s the nature of our relationship. I understand how those things get started and why they get started. But I also knew what the facts were.” \nDespite reports of friction between the athletic director and coach, Swarbrick, who is in his ninth year at Notre Dame, says that was just outside perception. He reaffirmed Kelly’s job was never in question. “No,” he said. “Never.” \n“I know what my relationship is with him,” Swarbrick said. “There is such a significant amount of what’s written about the program that simply isn’t true. It took me awhile to figure it out, but you just can’t worry about it. You have to let it go. We have a great relationship. We have a level of candor that I think would surprise people.” \nThis includes Swarbrick confronting Kelly about his sideline demeanor, which is often criticized by fans and media on social media. Swarbrick says “we’ve talked about it” and they try to find a balance. \nIn late November, Notre Dame was hit with NCAA penalties after players were provided with impermissible benefits. When asked what culpability he had in the matter, Kelly responded: “Zero. Absolutely none.” Swarbrick told him he probably should have phrased that differently. \n“I understood it because it was central to our legal defense,” Swarbrick said. “This case is distinguished by the fact that there was no coach or administrator involved. And that was the point of the statement. We had spent a lot of time discussing with him our approach to the matter and that was central to it. \n“Now, of course, he’d be the first to concede that some preface to that statement would have been better, like, ‘I feel a sense of responsibility any time one of my students fails or makes a bad decision.’ But (he said), 'I have zero.' So, I understood it, but he could have phrased it a little differently to make both points.” \nThe university is still awaiting a ruling from the NCAA regarding its appeal on the vacation of wins. \nThree weeks ago, Kelly held an introductory news conference for his seven new coaches, the overhaul he essentially promised back on that rainy night in Los Angeles. He noted at the time that, ultimately, change begins at the top and admitted that “there are no bad football teams. There are just poorly-led football teams. And I think I led this team poorly.” \nSwarbrick sat in the back of the room that day. He was also in each locker room when Kelly admitted failure in front of his players. \n“There’s a vulnerability that coaches don’t often show their teams,” Swarbrick said. “And when they do, it has an impact. If there’s an evolution from the time I’ve been around athletics until now, from the athlete’s perspective, it’s that they want to know the coach. We talk to our coaches a lot about, you need to understand their environment. You have to let them see who you are because they don’t understand anything else.” \nSwarbrick said that this was “a little” hard for Kelly to comprehend, but more so for other coaches on staff. \nA few weeks after the season, Notre Dame held its annual Echoes award ceremony to honor the players following its 4-8 season. Swarbrick took the stage and began with a joke. \n“Sorry I was late,” he said. “I was catching up on back issues of The Observer.” \nIt drew a few laughs. The jab was at the angry Notre Dame alumni groups who had taken out a full page ad in the student-run newspaper that week calling for both Swarbrick and Kelly to be fired. The group raised thousands of dollars and took out multiple ads in several publications to note where the Irish have failed on and off the field. \nSwarbrick, who had not previously addressed the ads, said he has not had any communication with these groups. \n“I never worry about that,” Swarbrick said. “The hardest job in athletics is trying to generate passion in your program. If that sort of stuff bothers you, you can’t be the athletic director, head coach or the quarterback at Notre Dame.” 119 CONNECT 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:01:09.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
