(ABC South East SA: Kate Hill ) \nMC for the night, Coonalpyn Council's Nat Traeger draws a big laugh from the 120-strong crowd when she relayed a story of a man who approached her and queried if \"there are going to be any nudes\". \n\"He was still going to come anyway, but he was going to bring his friends if there were nudes,\" she said, before introducing the artist. \nQuietly spoken, as the artist guides the audience through a photographic slideshow of his recent projects, including Brim's now famous silos and a long train of wagons in New South Wales, there is silence in the room. \n\"I really want the work to be about you. It is not mine,\" van Helten said. \n\"I want you guys to take ownership of it. \n\"It is not just about the silos, it is where they sit and the community they sit in.\" Photo: Silo selfie: Nat Traeger and Mayor Neville Jaensch try out their new marketing tool — a selfie frame.

The power of art \nBorn and bred Coonalpyn resident Brett Dewhurst admits he had never heard of the name Guido van Helten before the Coonalpyn silo project was announced in July last year . \n\"I heard he did the Brim silos,\" he said. \n\"They were really good and it brought a lot back to their town. Hopefully it does the same here.\" Photo: Coonalpyn resident Brett Dewhurst is hoping the project revitalises the town. (ABC South East SA: Kate Hill ) \nWith his wife Tracy, Mr Dewhurst is opening a cafe with what promises to soon be the best view in town — the front windows looking directly onto the silos. \nCalled the Coonalpyn Silo Cafe, the business will be one of the first opened in the town for some years and Mr Dewhurst hopes the artwork will help guide visitors and small businesses back to the town. \n\"It has just died recently,\" he said, matter-of-factly. \n\"There is not much industry here anymore.\" \nAs a small child, he remembered a once-bustling main street filled with small businesses and farming industries. \nNow the sound of traffic, of which thousands of vehicles pass through the town each day, pervades the main strip. Photo: The Dukes Highway brings heavy traffic though Coonalpyn each day. (ABC South East SA: Kate Hill ) \nIn the last six months, the town has turned the steady stream of highway traffic into a positive. \nThe arts renewal project Creating Coonalpyn is six individual projects on the highway designed to give drivers a reason to stop, rather than just pass through. \nNow that steady stream of traffic is going to be the town's fortune and council has already planned an RV festival after the silos are complete, designed to show off the town's revamped look. \n\"Coonalpyn is now having it's turn in the sun,\" Coorong District Council's Neville Jaensch said. \n\"We are right behind the community with this project. They are a very enthusiastic bunch and very proud of their community.\" Who will feature? \nEven before it has begun, van Helten's arrival in town has already caused a bit of a stir and generated more media than the town has seen in decades. \nMuch of the speculation is about which residents might be immortalised in the project, after Brim's silo subjects became mini-celebrities overnight . \nBut the artist does not know yet. Although his work attracts international attention, van Helten is planning a fairly down-to-earth approach to finding any possible diamonds in the rough. \n\"We will see. There are no plans,\" he said. \n\"I just like to hang out and meet people. I am very relaxed.\" \nIn the coming week, the artist will be grabbing his camera, settling into town, conducting workshops at the local primary school and getting the vibe of Coonalpyn. \nSo if you pull up a barstool at the Coonalpyn Hotel in the next few days and see a young man with his camera, don't be surprised if he asks to take your photo. \n\"I take photographs and just hang out with people,\" van Helten says with a smile. \n\"My work is about people.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:59:31.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
