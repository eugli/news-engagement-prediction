(Francine Orr/Los Angeles Times) \nA couple dozen activists came out to a suburban cul-de-sac in Lancaster Thursday night to hold a candlelight vigil outside Rep. Steve Knight's house, part of a statewide effort targeting seven GOP representatives . \nThe protesters were there in large part to demand a town hall meeting with Knight to discuss the Trump administration's immigration and healthcare policies. \nA problem quickly emerged as protesters neared a home they believed belonged to Knight: Two neighbors said the congressman and his family moved out in the last few months. \nMinutes later, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy asked the protesters to get off the home's driveway and the activists shuffled back to their cars. \nLilia Galindo, who hosts a bilingual radio show in the Antelope Valley aimed at the region's growing Latino population, said she was frustrated Knight had not had a town hall since the election. \n\"He shouldn't be afraid of us,\" she said. \"He should meet with us.\" \nAbout 200 people held a similar demonstration outside of Rep. Darrell Issa's home in Vista, north of San Diego. He was at another event, but his staff handed out cookies. \nDarren Parker, a local civil rights activist and the chair of the state Democratic Party's African American Caucus, said organizers with the Service Employees International Union believed Knight lived at the house. \nDespite that, Parker said, there was still merit in the protesters bringing their message to Knight's former community. \n\"There is so much uncertainty and fear for what is coming next,\" he said.
