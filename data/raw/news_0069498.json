Howard Dean announced his support on Wednesday for South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg to be the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \nDean, who was himself the DNC chair from 2005-2009, told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that he is backing Buttigieg because the Democratic Party desperately needs an infusion of young blood from outside the political sphere of Washington. The Indiana mayor perfectly fits the bill, Dean said. Story Continued Below \n“Most important thing: he’s the outside-the-beltway candidate. This party is in trouble. Our strongest age group that votes for us is under 35. And they don't consider themselves Democrats,” Dean said, noting the low turnout among younger voters in mid-term and down-ballot races. “Our leadership is old and creaky, including me, and we’ve got to have this guy, 36 years old, running this party. I had dinner with him last night. He is really, really capable and smart.” \nButtigieg, who is 35 years old, not 36, as Dean stated, has been the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, since 2012 and before that was a candidate to be Indiana’s state treasurer. As a Naval reserve officer, Buttigieg was deployed to Afghanistan for seven months in 2014. \nWhile he has earned a handful of high-profile endorsements, including Dean’s and that of former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, Buttigieg is up against higher-profile candidates for the job of DNC chair. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), as well as former Secretary of Labor Tom Perez, who has the endorsement of former Vice President Joe Biden, are both among the group seeking their party’s chairmanship. Dean himself had previously announced a run to be DNC chair before withdrawing. \nDean’s endorsement comes just days ahead of the election for DNC chairman, which will happen at the Democratic National Committee’s winter meeting, which kicks off this week in Atlanta. \nAsked about Buttigieg’s chances of besting his more well-known opponents, Dean said the Indiana mayor is “everybody’s second choice,” positioning him well in a party that remains divided after Hillary Clinton’s surprising and devastating defeat in last year’s presidential election. Perez and Ellison “represent certain interests inside the Democratic Party who are at odds with each other,” Dean said, opening a window for Buttigieg to win the chairmanship. \n“We need outside-the-beltway. I've had enough of all these endorsements from senators and congressman,” Dean said, recalling his own tenure as DNC chair. “I think it's time for an outsider. I was an outsider. I came in. We didn't have the house, the senate, or the presidency and when I left we had the house, the presidency and the senate. You can do this in four years.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:53:26.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
