It sought to ban the wearing of religious symbols, such as Muslim headscarves, Jewish kippahs, and large crucifixes for all public employees during work hours.\nReligious garb OK for cops, judges, says Bouchard-Taylor report's co-author Quebec politicians stress diversity, inclusion in face of Trump refugee ban The divisive charter was seen by opponents as targeting Muslim women. It was ultimately defeated when the PQ lost the provincial election in 2014.\nThe proposal to revive the charter led to intense exchanges over religious accommodation in the National Assembly. The PQ, Coalition Avenir Québec et Québec Solidaire are asking the Couillard government to ban the wearing of religious symbols only for public servants in positions of authority.\nPremier Philippe Couillard seized on the controversy to claim that there's no consensus in the matter among the opposition.\nThe PQ youth wing made other proposals Sunday morning, including a mechanism to remove MNAs and elected municipal officials who have been charged with a criminal offense.\nWith files from Presse Canadienne", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:38:52.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
