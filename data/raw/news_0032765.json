Aaron/Redferns \nThe famed guitar of Grateful Dead ’s Jerry Garcia , “Wolf,” will be auctioned at a Guernsey’s event on March 14 at the Brooklyn Bowl in New York City. Proceeds from the auction will support the Southern Poverty Law Center , which “is dedicated to fighting hate and bigotry and to seeking justice for the most vulnerable members of our society,” according to the website. Find a photo of Garcia playing the guitar below. \n“Wolf,” which was custom made by luthier Doug Irwin, first appeared in 1973 during a performance the Dead gave for the Hell’s Angels. It was used for many of the band’s concerts and recordings thereafter. Following Garcia’s death, the guitar was auctioned at a 2002 Guernsey’s event where it sold for nearly $1 million, more than doubling the existing world record. That buyer has gifted the guitar back to Guernsey’s for this auction, wishing to support the SPLC and its fight against racism. \nPhoto by Mick Gold/Redferns", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:26:11.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
