Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nVin Diesel has teamed up with Selena Gomez to create possibly the most unlikely musical collaboration of all time - and it's completely real. \nAlthough he's better known for his action hero roles in adrenaline fueled blockbusters like the Fast & Furious series, it seems the actor has a softer side. \nHe's certainly proven it on It Ain't Me, a tender acoustic ballad with the Come & Get It singer, as they teamed up with producer Kygo on the unexpected track. Vin Diesel has joined forces with Selena Gomez (Photo: vindiesel/Instagram) This is actually a thing that has happened (Photo: FilmMagic) \n\"I don't know how you did it @kygomusic,\" he wrote alongside a behind the scenes clip in the studio on Friday before unveiling the full song on Facebook. \n\"Who would have ever believed how mixing my voice with @selenagomez could be so powerful! Can't wait for the world to hear it.\" \nHe admitted he couldn't stop listening to the track and described the experience as \"a dream come true\". He has been in the studio (Photo: vindiesel/Instagram) As far as unlikely duets go... (Photo: Getty) \nIn the behind-the-scenes clip, he was praised by producers for trying \"something new\" and putting \"everything into it\", with one man saying: \"So it's f***ing badass. You just came here. You killed it. This is not what you do.\" \nIt's clear Vin Diesel is proud of the song - and he later shared a picture on Instagram and gushed over the new project. He's so proud of the record (Photo: vindiesel/Instagram) \n\"I stepped out of my comfort zone for this one, haha. Let me know what you think. Thank you @kygomusic for producing this 2017 HIT! Thank you for believing in me enough to ask me to sing,\" he wrote. \n\"Thank you @Selenagomez for bringing that beautiful and magical voice. Pained and celebratory simultaneously. I followed your lead when I went into the booth â€¦ #kygoselenavin #ItAintMe #gratefultomakemagic #believeinyou.
