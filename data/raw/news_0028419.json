As for the dress, as Paul describes, it’s the work of Tisci at his best. “It took 1,600 hours to make, as all panels are pleated separately and put together,” said the stylist of the intricate bodice. \"I love the meshing of the unique, opulent, cerebral designs that are submerged in the past, yet so incredibly modern and feminine. The techniques he uses are exciting and give such depth to his creations. It’s opulent yet demure. I can trust Givenchy to deliver incredible gowns.” And with Adele slated to perform later tonight, here’s hoping she makes an equally grand style statement onstage.
