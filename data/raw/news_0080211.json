Andrew Saunders pleaded guilty to the murder charges. Photo: Supplied \nThe 21-year-old bought knives and latex gloves before finally searching \"how to slice a neck\" and \"how to smoke a cigar\", prosecutor Philip Bennett QC told the court. \nMrs Justice Nicola Davies DBE is due to sentence Saunders after a hearing which is expected to last two days. \nThe court heard Saunders and Miss Morgan were in a relationship between June 2014 and July 2016, when she broke up with him.

Zoe Morgan and Lee Simmons were both killed by Saunders in Cardiff last September. Photo: Supplied \nOn the day of the killing, at 5.45am, Saunders walked towards the entrance to Matalan where Miss Morgan and Mr Simmons were waiting, took out an eight-inch knife from his rucksack and began to attack Mr Simmons. \nAs the victim called out \"please\", \"help, help, help\" and \"stop, stop\", Mr Bennett said Saunders replied \"f*** off\" and continued his knife attack, which one witness described as a frenzy. \nMiss Morgan tried to pull the defendant off Mr Simmons but was told \"I'm coming for you next\". \nShe started screaming and ran towards Boots but was caught by Saunders who took out a second knife and fatally stabbed her as well. \nPolice and paramedics tried to save the couple, Mr Bennett said, but were unable to. They each had eight stab wounds. Saunders told Zoe Morgan she was next before chasing her down and stabbing her to death. Photo: Supplied \nAs officers searched for Saunders, he spoke to his mother on the phone then drove to the family home before, at 6.30am, posting on Facebook \"F***\" and then later adding: \"Product of society.\" \nWhen he was arrested, he told police: \"I'm sorry, you know sometimes you just snap,\" and then asked \"are they both dead?\". \nSaunders' counsel, Winston Roddick QC, said his client was in \"emotional turmoil\" at the time of the offence because of the end of the relationship with Miss Morgan. \n\"He is genuinely remorseful for what he has done and more than once said he wishes to turn the clock back,\" Mr Roddick said. \nSaunders, of no fixed address, has previously pleaded guilty to the two murders and is due to sentenced on Tuesday.
