Look. Away. Share via Twitter Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Everyone's eyes may be glued to the dramatic match-up between the Patriots and the Falcons this Super Bowl Sunday , but personally, we can't stop staring at a photo we never knew we needed of two sports stars in attendance, Olympic gymnast Simone Biles and NBA star Shaquille O'Neal. Aside from their stunning athletic abilities, it may not seem like these two have much in common‚ÄîBiles took home four gold medals and one bronze at the 2016 Rio Olympics and managed to stun the world with her ability to flip through the air among performing other incredible stunts, while Shaq is known more for his uncanny ability to dunk a ball. But if you really think about it, these two share one important commonality: They both stand at extreme heights. Biles is reportedly a mere 4-foot-9, while Shaq clocks in at 7-foot-1. By some crazy twist of fate, Biles and O'Neal had a run-in at Super Bowl LI, and the two athletes posed for an amazing photo that only emphasizes the stark difference between their statures. The gymnast posted to the pic to Twitter with the very understated caption, \"hey shaq üëãüèæ.\" Hey, indeed. These two are living proof that unreal athleticism can come in all shapes and sizes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:12:06.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
