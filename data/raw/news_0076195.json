More View photos Chelsea's new manager Antonio Conte could be set to leave Stamford Bridge at the end of the season and may make a possible return to the Serie A, according to reports from La Repubblica . The 47-year-old is reportedly homesick as this is his first season in charge of the Blues. The former Juventus manager has so far had a sensational season with the Premier League side and is rapidly running away with the first position on the table. Reports also claim that Serie A giants Inter Milan are ready to bring in the tactical mastermind at the San Siro during the summer. Club negotiations have already started to bring back Conte into Italy's Serie A. Internazionale's new owners called the Suning Group have sent their representatives to make a lucrative offer to Conte. Antonio Conte is also reportedly unsatisfied with owner Roman Abramovich over the club's transfer budget not yet being confirmed for the summer transfer window. It could mean that there is a lack of trust between the management and owners. While Inter Milan already have Stefano Pioli in charge, the Italian club has expressed their interest in the experienced Conte who claimed three straight Scudetto titles with Juventus. Conte also has international expertise as he managed the national team of Italy in the Euro qualifications and the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament. Conte is a wanted man, especially after the tremendous impact he has created upon the Chelsea football club and in the English Premier League in general.
