This secretly recorded audio was obtained at CNN’s Atlanta headquarters in 2009,” the website says. “In order to expose media malfeasance within CNN, we need your help transcribing, investigating and connecting the dots on these 200+ hours of audio.” O’Keefe tweeted, “I want to start exposing the media and their flaws. This is the beginning of the end for the MSM. And it starts today.” Also Read: James O'Keefe Threatens to Leak 'Hundreds of Hours' of CNN Newsroom Footage CNN did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment. While TheWrap has no proof that any of the footage is authentic, CNN has reported the story itself and it will be interesting to see how the network covers the information going forward. He sent another tweet mocking CNN talent , saying he hopes they’re on their best behavior. O’Keefe’s Twitter feed has been extremely active since using the platform to release the initial “CNN Leaks,” holding a press conference in what appears to be a hotel room and broadcasting it via Periscope. “A lot of guilty consciousness at CNN, we’re learning,” O’Keefe said, explaining that CNN producers have been calling him “freak out” regarding what could be found on the footage dump.

For years, O’Keefe has targeted liberal groups with questionable tactics, but his Project Veritas has been criticized for selectively editing videos. According to PolitiFact , his videos are “edited in ways that the context of the conversation or the meaning of the statement isn’t always clear.” O’Keefe’s work has triggered the resignation of Democratic operatives who were caught discussing ways to disrupt Trump rallies. He first gained notoriety for his 2009 headline-grabbing takedown of ACORN, a community organizing group that helped register low-income people to vote. The groups dissolved after Congress defunded it. Other O’Keefe targets include NPR and Planned Parenthood. Meanwhile,O’Keefe is now offering $10,000 to anyone “willing to provide video/audio exposing malfeasance” in the mainstream media.
