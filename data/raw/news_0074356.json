Did Senator David Fawcett just describe boat arrivals as fleas? #estimates #auspol pic.twitter.com/iWkjwc2eio February 27, 2017 Kathy Stewart (@Kate2651) #Senator Fawcett your reference to desperate people as \"fleas\" reflects inhumanity and arrogance. There but for the grace of God....Shame. February 27, 2017 \nThe Labor senator Kim Carr had asked a series of questions about an audit office report highlighting immigration department cost blowouts. \nFawcett asked the minister assisting the prime minister on the public service, Michaelia Cash , about the cost savings of having closed detention centres and stopped boats, and the “stress” placed on the department by high numbers of boat arrivals to Australia. \nCash said there had been large numbers of “unauthorised arrivals” under the Rudd and Gillard governments. \n“It is the unfortunate reality in terms of what occurred under the former Labor government that they wound back the former Howard government’s strong border protection policies,” she said. “The statistics in terms of the unauthorised arrivals led to a course of events which, unfortunately, this government is still trying to clean up.” \nFawcett then made his “fleas” remarks, directing his comment at Carr.
