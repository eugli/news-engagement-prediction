We need to increase efforts on attracting more tourists from West Asia through the support and cooperation of travel agents and companies,” he added. \nDr Ahmad Zahid also wanted an increase in the number of flights from this region to Malaysia through collaboration with companies and agents handling umrah packages. \n“I will discuss this with companies offering umrah packages while I am here,” he said, adding that he would also be holding talks with the country’s leadership on increasing bilateral trade between the two countries. \nIn the past two years, Dr Ahmad Zahid said trade volume between the two countries saw a decline, following the drop in oil and gas prices that affected both countries. \nOn this matter, he said several agreements, which were being drafted by the business councils of both countries, would be finalised soon. \nBesides those involving travel and investment, Dr Ahmad Zahid said several agreements on the exchange of security and defence information, staff and training would be signed. \nFollowing Qatar’s selection as host of the FIFA World Cup in 2022, Dr Ahmad Zahid said Malaysian firms could be involved in the supply of goods and equipment. — Bernama", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:04:50.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
