Ad Feedback \nPsychotherapist and mental health advocate Kyle MacDonald said the increasing number of police call outs for mental distress was a direct reflection of inadequate health services. \n\"The obvious assumption – and I think a fair assumption – is that this directly reflects an increase in demand, along with services not being able to respond because when you can't get through to a crisis team you call 111.\" \nMore mental health crisis teams were desperately needed to help people in distress, he said. \nHealth Minister Jonathan Coleman last year announced funding for a phone triage service, whereby people in crisis would be referred to health professionals when they called 111. The service was expected to benefit about 45,000 people a year and be available to all DHBs by the end of this year. \nColeman said New Zealand was not alone in experiencing more demand for mental health services. \n\"There's been a lot of work done to de-stigmatise mental health issues. Waiting times for mental health services have also decreased. However, there's always more to do.\" \nMental Health Foundation chief executive Shaun Robinson said the police figures were disturbing and pointed to \"very big gaps\" in support for those in serious mental health distress. \n\"It's not appropriate for the police to become a mental health service by default.\" \nThe Government needed to do a lot more to ensure people had access to appropriate support, he said. \n\"We will give them a chance to come up with some initiatives that take us forward and we would expect to see some strong initiatives in the Budget.\" \nWHERE TO GET HELP: \nLifeline: 0800 543 354 \nSuicide Crisis Helpline: 0508 828 865 / 0508 TAUTOKO (24/7).
