Getty By Emma Dibdin Feb 22, 2017 Donald Trump spent many years criticizing President Barack Obama for – among other things – spending too much taxpayer money on golfing trips , vacations and presidential travel on Air Force One. But according to a new report in The Washington Post , Trump's travel during his first month in office has likely cost as much as Obama spent on travel in an average year. Trump's three consecutive weekend trips to his private Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida alone \"probably cost the federal treasury about $10 million, based on figures used in an October government report analyzing White House travel,\" explains the Post . Meanwhile, a Judicial Watch report from December put Obama's total travel costs over eight years at just under $97 million. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The costs of Trump's Mar-a-Lago trips include enlisting the Coast Guard to patrol the exposed shoreline, and other security, military, and staffing expenses incurred by moving Trump and his presidential apparatus to the so-called winter White House. This, presumably, is why most presidents content themselves with one year-round White House. Another estimated $1.3 million was spent on Secret Service protection for Trump's sons Eric and Donald Jr. during overseas business trips. That brings the month's total to an estimated $11.3 million, just short of the $12.1 million average that Obama spent on travel in a year. Most Popular The costs of the first family's \"unusually elaborate lifestyle\" don't stop with Florida – New York City is paying $500,000 a day to guard Trump Tower, where Melania Trump and her son Barron now live. High security and travel costs have also been incurred by Trump's sons taking business trips abroad – Eric Trump's recent trip to Uruguay cost the Secret Service and US Embassy roughly $100,000. And that's not even getting into the moral costs of having sensitive, potentially classified presidential business carried out in front of paying guests at Mar-a-Lago.
