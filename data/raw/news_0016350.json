(Gregory Payan/AP)  27 PM \nIt was a ball breaker of a way to end Tom Brady’s fifth Super Bowl title, a win the Patriots quarterback engineered in historic fashion, overcoming a 25-point deficit. \nFollowing New England’s stunning 34-28 Super Bowl LI overtime win against the Falcons at Houston’s NRG Stadium Sunday night, Brady’s game-used No. 12 Patriots jersey went missing, and the five-time Super Bowl champion signal-caller was none too happy to find out the news when he was seated at his locker after the game. \n“Someone stole it. I put it in here, man,” Brady says on a video that’s taken in front of his locker post-game. Brady is pointing to his locker stall and appears to be talking to a Patriots clubhouse attendant about the alleged theft. \nOn Monday morning, Brady confirmed to reporters at a press conference to accept his Super Bowl LI MVP award that the famous threads were gone. \n“It’s unfortunate, because that’s a nice piece of memorabilia. If it shows up on eBay or something, somebody let me know. I’ll try to track that down,” Brady said. “Those are pretty special ones to keep. But what can you do? I’ll take the ring. That’s good enough for me.” \nTexas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick was promising top law enforcement personnel were going to get to the bottom of the alleged theft. \n“In Texas we place a very high value on hospitality and football. Tom Brady’s jersey has great historical value and is already being called ‘the most valuable NFL collectable ever.’ It will likely go into the Hall of Fame one day. It is important that history does not record that it was stolen in Texas. I’ve called Colonel Steve McCraw to ask that the Texas Rangers work with the Houston Police Department on this case,” Patrick said in a statement on his website. “I’m a Texans and Cowboys fan first, but the unquestionable success of the Super Bowl in Houston last night was a big win for our entire state and I don’t want anything to mar that victory. Whoever took this jersey should turn it in. The Texas Rangers are on the trail.” \n“We have offered our assistance to the Houston Police Department,” a spokesperson from the Texas Department of Public Safety said in an email, confirming the Texas Rangers law enforcement personnel were involved in the investigation. Tom Brady. (ADREES LATIF/REUTERS) \nHouston Police tweeted Monday that its Major Offenders division is working with NFL security and with state and local law enforcement officials to investigate the theft. \nKen Goldin, the founder of Goldin Auctions, told the Daily News Monday that Brady’s jersey is probably worth close to $500,000, but since it’s allegedly stolen property, the purported thief will have a hard time getting anyone to pony up the money. \n“There is no statute of limitations on stolen property,” said Goldin. “It would be pennies on the dollar, because anyone buying it from the (alleged thief) couldn’t turn around and sell it. Everybody knows it’s stolen.” \nGoldin said the sensible thing to do would be for the alleged thief to retain a lawyer. \n“Turn the jersey over to the lawyer and see if he or she can get reward money. The Patriots probably prepared two, three, maybe four jerseys for Brady to use in the game,” said Goldin. “The tailoring was done by hand. Brady went down a number of times in the game, so there is likely marks on the jersey that reflect that. That would be the way to verify game-used jerseys. There would be the Super Bowl logo and other identification. I’d like to get in touch with the Patriots, and offer to help. But I personally believe it will surface.” \nBrady, who was suspended the first four games of the 2016 season for his role in the 2015 Deflategate scandal, said on WEEI Monday that the jersey vanished while he was briefly away from his locker. \n“I put (the jersey) in my bag and I went in (to the locker room) to take my eye black off and they had opened up to, I don’t know, the media,” Brady said on WEEI. “And I walked back to my bag and it was gone. Same thing happened two years ago (in the Super Bowl against Seattle). That sucks, but, oh well.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:47:07.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
