The pundits didn't think we'd win,\" he told the crowd, saying \"they all underestimated the power of the people.\" \n\"Never underestimate the people,\" said Trump, declaring that his administration is \"fighting the fake news\" and again calling the \"fake news\" media to be \"the enemy of the people.\" Read Full Article \nTrump derided CNN as the \"Clinton News Network\" and chided the media for making up stories and sources, calling out one story which cited nine sources in reporting on his campaign's contact with Russian officials. \nHe said that he did not declare the media overall to be the enemy of the American people, only the \"fake news\" aspect of the media. \n\"They shouldn't be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody's name. Let their name be put out there,\" he said. \nTrump said the polls during the campaign were \"made up\" as well. \nHe then said he \"loves\" the First Amendment and that \"nobody\" loves it more than he does. Trump said the First Amendment gives him and others the right to call out the \"dishonest fake news.\" . @POTUS : \"I love the First Amendment. Nobody loves it better than me. Nobody. Who uses it more than I do?\" #CPAC2017 pic.twitter.com/KgetJZePZk \n— Fox News (@FoxNews) February 24, 2017 \n\"As you saw throughout the campaign and even now, the fakes news doesn't tell the truth. ... It doesn't represent the people, it never will represent the people and we're going to do something about it,\" said Trump. \nTrump said the world has never seen a \"movement\" like his, bringing up Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, which he said \"petered out.\" \n\"I like Bernie,\" he said, claiming that he has a lot of support from the Vermont senator's very liberal backers. \nTrump said the \"core conviction\" of his movement is for America \"to put its own citizens first.\" \nThe president said he's \"way ahead of schedule\" on building the border wall and that DHS is getting the \"bad dudes\" out of the country. \nHe said the gang members, drug dealers and criminal aliens are being removed \"as we speak.\" \n\"All I've done is keep my promise,\" said Trump. \nTrump told the crowd he \"inherited a mess,\" including a \"failed health care law that threatens our medical system.\" \nHe said ObamaCare doesn't work and the issue was decided in the election. Trump said the law will be improved and become less expensive. \n\"ObamaCare covers very few people,\" he said, noting that many people already had great health care that was then taken away. . @POTUS : \"I inherited a mess believe me. We also inherited a failed healthcare law that threatens our medical system...\" #CPAC2017 pic.twitter.com/tEeK3oIOIC \n— FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) February 24, 2017 \nTrump said the United States spent $6 trillion in the Middle East but the region is in \"much worse shape\" than it was 15 years ago. He said \"we could have rebuilt our country three times with that money.\" \n\"When was the last time we won? Did we win a war? Did we win anything,\" he asked, later vowing to \"rebuild the military\" and take care of veterans while \"eradicating\" ISIS from the planet. \n\"We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country,\" Trump vowed, hinting at a new order to replace the controversial travel ban which was rejected in federal court. \n— FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) February 24, 2017 \nThe president took on globalism, saying he's representing the United States, not the \"globe.\" \n\"There's no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency or a global flag,\" he said.

I’m not representing the globe.” pic.twitter.com/adIbFDovu6 \n— BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) February 24, 2017 \nHe closed his remarks by promising that \"America is coming back.\" \n\"It's roaring. It's going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before,\" said Trump. \nTrump notably skipped the event in 2016 after reports that those who opposed his candidacy would stage a walk-out. \nHe first spoke at CPAC in 2011, when there was speculation that he'd challenge for the GOP nomination the following year. \nVice President Mike Pence spoke to the crowd last night, along with Judge Jeanine Pirro , while Steve Bannon made headlines with his rare public remarks Thursday afternoon.
