(Ted Slowik / Daily Southtown) \nWill County Executive Larry Walsh, a former state senator, addresses the need for bipartisan cooperation to resolve the Illinois budget impasse during an interview on Wednesday, Feb. 22, 2017. (Ted Slowik / Daily Southtown) Ted Slowik Privacy Policy \nWill County Executive Larry Walsh has worked in politics his entire life, and he's never seen it this bad. \nWalsh, who turns 69 on March 3, remembers when Democrats and Republicans compromised when it was time to work through political differences and do the jobs they were elected to do. \n\"(Former House Speaker) Tip O'Neill was just as adamant for his Democratic side as Ronald Reagan was for the Republican and the conservative side,\" Walsh told me Wednesday. \n\"But they could sit down because there was a willingness to do something to help improve the quality of life of their constituencies and the people of America. They got it done.\" \nDuring an hour-long conversation, Walsh shared his thoughts on politics and government at the local, state and federal levels. \nIn November, Walsh, a Democrat, won an unprecedented fourth term as Will County executive. Republicans, however, picked up a seat on the Will County Board and extended their majority to 16-10. \nThough it may be lacking in state and national politics, bipartisan compromise is alive and well in Will County government, Walsh said. \n\"By working together we can get a lot accomplished,\" he said. \"It's only been proven by what we've done.\" Donald Trump 's new guidelines on immigration enforcement, an immigrant advocate told me Tuesday.\nSouthland communities with large populations of undocumented Latinos include Blue Island, Calumet City,... \nThousands of Latinos in the south suburbs are worried about being deported because of President Donald Trump 's new guidelines on immigration enforcement, an immigrant advocate told me Tuesday. \nSouthland communities with large populations of undocumented Latinos include Blue Island, Calumet City,... (Ted Slowik) \nAccomplishments include approval of a $275 million building campaign. Work began last year on a new Public Safety Complex off Laraway Road, east of U.S. 52, near New Lenox. \nWalsh said he visited the project site Wednesday morning and expects the building to be finished by its scheduled completion date of Dec. 31. \n\"They've had an almost unbelievable winter that's allowed them to get a lot of work done,\" he said. \"We wanted to break ground in June but we didn't really start until right after Labor Day. They've certainly made up the difference in January and February.\" \nThe facility will house the sheriff's office, 911 communications center and other services. Walsh said he's \"very confident\" the project will be within or under its $30 million budget. \nThe centerpiece of the building campaign is construction of a 10-story, $195 million courthouse in downtown Joliet. The new facility will be built west of the existing courthouse, where specialty court services are housed in a former First Midwest Bank building. \nThere's a lot to unpack from President Donald Trump 's historic news conference Thursday afternoon.\nHe eerily described nuclear holocaust. He awkwardly invited an African-American reporter to set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus.

He awkwardly invited an African-American reporter to set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. He asserted the White House is \"running like a fine-tuned... (Ted Slowik) \nThe timetable calls for relocating drug court and other services by the end of this year and demolishing the former bank building early next year, Walsh said. \n\"If all that is accomplished and the site is prepared and ready to go, we might see (work on the courthouse) start in late 2018 or early 2019,\" Walsh said. \"All indications are it will take two years to complete.\" \nWalsh praised the efforts of Capital Improvements Committee chair Ray Tuminello, a Republican from New Lenox, for effectively overseeing numerous construction projects in various stages of completion. The county also plans to build new facilities for its health department services, he said. \nBipartisan cooperation is helping government run smoothly in Will County, he said, and private investment is booming. Companies like Amazon are creating jobs in the intermodal and logistics fields. \nWalsh, who served in the state Senate from 1997 to 2005, said Illinois needs bipartisan cooperation to pass a balanced budget. He believes Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner bears responsibility for the budget impasse. \n\"I think it's absolutely sinful,\" he said of the budget stalemate. \"The constitution says the governor is to appear before the Legislature every year and provide a balanced budget and give them the opportunity … to put their perspective on expenses and revenues. \n\"I'm thoroughly disappointed that Gov. Rauner, who wanted to be governor, who spent a lot of money to be governor, now he shies away from his responsibility … The ball starts right there in your court. He has failed for three years straight.\" \nWalsh lauded the budget efforts of Democratic Senate President John Cullerton of Chicago and Republican Senate Minority Leader Christine Radogno of Lemont. \n\"They quietly worked together behind the scenes in a collaborative way to come up with a plan,\" he said. \"Everyone doesn't like everything that's in there but everybody should like enough of what's in there where they can hold their noses and do something.\" \nWalsh said he's troubled by the amount of campaign money in politics today. \n\"It's unbelievable that two candidates run against each other for the (state) Senate spend a combined $5 million for an office that pays $67,000 a year,\" he said. \n\"If those people were willing to donate that money to charity, what we could do for homelessness in this country, for science research, we could possibly go a long way toward finding a cure for diabetes or cancer.\" \nWhile they were both in the Senate, Walsh was known to play poker with Barack Obama . Political fighting worsened during his presidency, he said. \n\"I always thought President Obama could have brought more compromise (and) bipartisanship. He was good at that in Springfield. I saw him firsthand put together legislation that passed even when Democrats were in the minority because he could do that.\" \nWalsh said political opponents need to talk to each other in person more often to achieve compromise. He shared a recollection of the friendship between former Democrat U.S. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski — the powerful chairman of the Ways and Means Committee later convicted of mail fraud — and U.S. Rep. Bob Michel, the former GOP House minority leader who died last week. Both represented Illinois. \n\"They'd ride out together to Washington D.C. in a station wagon,\" Walsh said. \"They could find a way to make it palatable … You could be partisan when you needed to be but there was also a time to be bipartisan when it was the right thing to do.\" \nRepublicans — who refused to even consider Obama's Supreme Court nominee — have been more reluctant to compromise than Democrats, Walsh said. The GOP has achieved power in both legislative houses and the presidency, but now they have to govern. \n\"Now even Republicans admit, after so many votes to repeal Obamacare … why didn't they work together … to come up with a better piece of legislation? … Now they're finding out it's a tough job coming up with a whole new program.\" \nWalsh said he believes Republicans are in store for a \"potential backlash,\" like Democrats experienced when Tea Party -supported candidates helped Republicans take the House majority in 2010. \n\"We're seeing some of the same things now,\" Walsh said. \"Some of the Republican senators and House members are catching quite a bit of static in their town hall meetings. It's not pretty.\" \nI asked Walsh if there was any change in the dormant status of two big proposals for eastern Will County — the Illiana Expressway and a third airport near Peotone. He said there was no change, that Rauner was holding the projects \"hostage.\" \nWalsh has served in public office since 1970, when he was elected to the school board in Elwood, where he still lives. He served as Jackson Township supervisor from 1973 until 2004. \nFinally, I asked Walsh if he was considering retiring. If he serves out his current term he'll be 72 in late 2020, around the time the new courthouse is set to open. \n\"I haven't even thought about that yet,\" Walsh said. \"I just got re-elected.\" \nTwitter @tedslowik", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:49:57.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
