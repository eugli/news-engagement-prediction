But when Sarah comes face to face with the sinister salon owner, will he manage to convince her that his intentions are pure or will Sarah realise that Bethany is being groomed? \nFans know that Bethany’s situation is dire, with a sexual exploitation storyline developing out of Bethany growing closer to evil Nathan. His manipulation has preyed on Bethany’s vulnerability and she believes that she is in a mutually loving relationship and is enjoying feeling like an adult, unaware of what lies around the corner. \nAll Sarah knows is that Bethany has a boyfriend and she has stayed at his flat and, realising that banning Bethany from seeing him will just lead to her defying her, Sarah decides it’s time she met Nathan for herself. (Picture: ITV) \nFinding his number on Bethany’s phone, Sarah contacts him and invites him for tea and Bethany is horrified when she finds out. \nBut how will Sarah respond when she meets Nathan and discovers his age – and will her suspicions about his intentions cause her concern for her daughter’s safety? \nOne to watch: Friday 3rd March at 8:30pm on ITV.
