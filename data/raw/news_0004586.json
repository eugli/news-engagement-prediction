Many live in Brooklyn, but some are in Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. \nGolden Deli, a Yemeni-owned bodega in Manhattan, was swelling with customers who picked up early lunches before it closed. \nNermin Radoncic, 22, walked up shortly after workers pulled down the shutters at noon. \nRadoncic, who lives nearby but is moving to Queens, was disappointed he could not buy a pastrami and Swiss sandwich on his last day in the neighborhood. But he said he supported the protest. \n\"They make the bomb sandwiches,\" Radoncic said of Golden Deli. \"This is like the best deli out here.
