'Bravery in dark days' \nThe Premier praised Mr Scipione especially his \"courage and bravery during some very dark days\". \nThe police chief said he was proud that police statistics reflected a reduction in crime across the board. \n\"There are people that are walking around our streets today that did not become victims of crime. They weren't raped, they weren't the subject of an assault, they didn't have their car stolen or their house broken into,\" Mr Scipione said. \n\"We made sure we did all we could to stop people becoming victims of crime.\" \nMr Scipione's last day will be April 2. The Premier said the new police commissioner would start on the job that day.
