Finance Minister Charles Sousa says the deficit for 2016-17 is now projected to be $1.9 billion, the lowest it has been since before the worldwide economic meltdown nine years ago.\nIn last February’s budget, Sousa had estimated the shortfall for this fiscal year would be $4.3 billion.\nThe improvement is due to $1.04 billion in higher corporate tax revenues, $803 million in increased harmonized sales tax proceeds, and an additional $728 million in personal income taxes collected.\nSpeaking to reporters at the MaRS Discovery District, which recently repaid $290 million in government loans three years ahead of scheduled, Sousa said he would finally balance the books in the spring budget.\n  minister promised the budget would also be in the black next year and in 2019.\nThe governing Liberals face voters in a June 2018 election.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:18:07.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
