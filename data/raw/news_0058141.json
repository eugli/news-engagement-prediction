Having a work spouse can help get us through the stress. \n\"Workers — especially those who are ambitious and career driven — spend a great deal of their time and energy at the office, [creating] a need for support, empathy, and a reality check from a trusted colleague in order to thrive, and some days just to survive,\" said Laura MacLeod, social worker and creator of From the Inside Out Project. \nAnd many of us just don't want to bog down our domestic partners with all that annoying, stressful work stuff. \nRelated: 12 Million Americans Keep This Secret From Their Partner \n\"Many workers don't want to discuss work issues at home with their domestic partners for a couple of reasons,\" said MacLeod. \"They want to leave work at the office, and make a clean break when they come home. [It may require] too much explanation of details and info to get the domestic partner up to speed and at the end of the day, the domestic partner isn't [in the office], so can't really get it fully.\" How to Make It Work \nMuch of the time, work spouses can have healthy, positive relationships. \nRobert Campbell, an analyst at WithumSmith+Brown is a heterosexual married man who has \"been with\" his work spouse, a heterosexual woman in a serious relationship, for years. \n\"We go to clients together, do speeches together, and have been called 'the dynamic duo,'\" said Campbell. \"In fact, when our firm merged last year I had to fight a bit to make sure we shared the same office even though neither of us are in it much.\" \nNow and then Campbell and his work spouse are the subject of office rumors and gossip, but neither lets it get to them. More importantly, Campbell has made a point of familiarizing his wife with his work spouse so that she too is comfortable with the platonic work arrangement. \n\"After my wife spent time with [my work spouse] she came to see her as a friend as well,\" said Campbell. \"I don't know if there is a secret or plan for those issues, as every situation is unique, [but] making my spouse comfortable with the relationship was just a matter of familiarity.\" Getting Naughty \nCampbell and his work spouse have taken care in setting clear boundaries — something that many can learn from. According to Captivate's poll, 7 percent of professionals said that they've \"crossed the line\" with a work spouse, and 7 percent said they hide their work spouse from their real spouse. In both cases it leaned more male than female. \n\"This year 13 percent of men said they crossed the line, up from 9 percent,\" said Marden. \"Seven percent of all men say their wives are jealous of their work spouse, and 11 percent hide their relationships from their spouse. It was very different for women, with only 3 percent admitting to having crossed the line, and 5 percent saying they hide their work spouse from their real spouse.\" \nCrossing the line may be easier than you think — and it doesn't have to be physical to cause upset at home.
