Credit Stephanie Keith/Reuters Yemeni-owned bodegas are institutions in many New York neighborhoods, selling everything from coffee and bagels to groceries and umbrellas. On Thursday, hundreds of the shops closed their doors to protest President Trump’s executive order temporarily barring immigrants from Yemen and six other majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. The work stoppage was scheduled to run from noon to 8 p.m., and a rally was set for 5:15 p.m. at Brooklyn Borough Hall, according to Yemeni-American community leaders who organized the events. Around 500 stores were expected to take part in the protest. “We are trying to tell Mr. Trump that America is the greatest and we want to keep it the greatest in the American way, not in his way,” said Nabil Ahmed Aljomai, who closed three Bronx stores that he owns. “His decision is racist and he’s not supposed to make a decision like that.” Mr. Aljomai immigrated to the United States in 1992. He and his eight children are citizens, but he said he knew families whose members had different immigration statuses, raising the possibility that they could be divided by the ban. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Some people, they are citizens and they have two or three of their children who are citizens, but if they have one family member on a visa they can all get stuck outside” the United States, he said. Yemeni visa-holders who were overseas when the executive order was issued are now unable to return. That is because the State Department revoked the visas of all nationals from the seven affected countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — even if they had lived in the United States for many years. “This is larger than the Yemeni community,” said Ibrahim Qatabi, 37, a legal assistant who planned to attend the rally in Brooklyn. “We are impacted by the ban, but it should concern every American. Once they ban one group they can ban another group, and that’s how people’s rights get sent back to the Dark Ages.” Mr. Qatabi said that his great-grandfather had immigrated to the United States from Yemen early in the 20th century and that his grandfather had worked for Ford Motor Company.
