This is because they are bound by the Chemists Act 1975, where they cannot verify or issue any report, like post-mortem report, if they are not registered. \n\"We also have sophisticated technology to detect poison and chemical residues, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) machine, UV detector and gas chromatography. So, there should not be any doubts,\" he said when contacted by Bernama . \n'No need to engage foreign expertise' \nAbdul Rahim said with the availability of local expertise, there was no need for Malaysia to engage foreign expertise to study the use of the toxic material in the case. \nThe chemical weapon could paralyse the nervous system and anyone in contact with it could die in half an hour due to breathing failure. \nLast Friday, inspector-general of police Khalid Abu Bakar said that the chemical 'Ethyl S-2-Diisopropylaminoethyl Methylphonothiolate' or VX nerve agent was used in Jong-nam's murder. \nJong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was at the KL International Airport 2 (klia2) at 8am on Feb 13 to board a flight to Macau an hour later when suddenly two women appeared before him and wiped his face with the palms of their hands, which contained a poisonous liquid. \nJong-nam sought help at a customer service counter at the airport, and was rushed to the Putrajaya Hospital, but he died on the way. He had come to Malaysia on Feb 6 and carried a passport bearing the name Kim Chol. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:09:28.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
