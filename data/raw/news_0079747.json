They enable us to speak with the voice of the public. \n“They provide us with the ability to identify patterns and hotspots of corruption, to target campaigns, to investigate and to litigate. They constitute the evidence that we present to those in authority,” Lewis said. \nThe organisation had made significant inputs into the Protected Disclosures Act in its bid to protect whistle-blowers. \nEarlier this year, the watchdog was invited to provide public commentary on the Protected Disclosures Amendment Bill by Parliament’ \n24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 We reserve editorial discretion to decide what will be published.
