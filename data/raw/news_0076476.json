So in the spirit of \"healing and coming together,\" Kimmel decided to bury the hatchet with his nemesis, actor Matt Damon . Jimmy Kimmel roasts Matt Damon at the #Oscars : \"When I first met Matt, I was the fat one.\" pic.twitter.com/ZOKmuPjOma — Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017 \n\"I've known Matt for a long time now. I've known Matt so long [that] when I first met Matt, I was the fat one,\" he said, as the camera panned to an unimpressed Damon. \"We've had problems — he's a selfish person, those of you who have worked with him know this.\" \nFor years, Kimmel and Damon have been \"battling\" it out publicly. At the 2016 Emmy Awards, Damon mocked Kimmel -- who was hosting -- for losing the accolade for best variety talk series. Ahead of the 2017 Oscars, Kimmel was photographed defacing Damon's seat card during rehearsals, and at arrivals, he tweeted a photo of himself watching Damon on ABC with the accompanying caption: \"Dead man walking the red carpet.\" Dead man walking the red carpet. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/j2KaUkdHTX — Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) February 27, 2017 \nOn the carpet, Damon told Ryan Seacrest that Kimmel's plan to have him banned at the ceremony would not work. \n\"I'm a member of the Academy,\" he said, \"so I think I'm going to be able to definitely make it into the theater. I don't know what he has in store for me; it's going to probably be ugly.\" \nPhoto: Getty Images ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:54:31.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
