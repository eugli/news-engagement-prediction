Now that I've watched it again, I have to say that this movie is incredible. Not only does this movie show the hard tragedy of life, but also shows the power of the human spirit when presented with these tragedies. I remember several of these scenes by heart and I can say that they have changed my view on life. Life is truly beautiful and you should watch it.P.S. For some reason iTunes is showing Rotten Tomatoes' reviews for a different movie, this movie has way more than a 50% rating. Enthralling by Cantwrtearev Roberto Benigni is a GENIUS. If you saw him at the Oscars receiving the award for this film, you will know there is no difference between who is as a person and the character in the film; a man of true heart that spills out into the world.Surprisingly, there were negative reviews of this film stating it's light hearted take on the holocaust. Well, that's the lens with which they view the world. When we see the world through the heart, that light shines forth, and we see reality for what it is. Then, there is a *choice* to be a victim. How do we respond? Mr. Benigni illustrates his choice marvelously both in his work and his presence at the Oscars. BRAVO! BRAVO! BRAVO!
