Images of Teddy Boys loitering in the street, children climbing lampposts and teenage girls all dolled-up for a Saturday dance were all captured by renowned photographer Roger Mayne throughout the 1950s. And the black-and-white snaps taken in North Kensington and working class streets across the country will feature in an exhibition at The Photographers' Gallery in London from next week. They serve as a record of a time when popular music, daring fashions and a high birth rate contributed to the boom of teenage culture. Mayne's work is iconic in the photography world and his humanistic approach to his work before his death in 2014 influenced an entire generation of photographers. The exhibition will run from March 3 to June 11. Working class youngsters hang out together in a west London street in 1956 Teddy Boys play a ball game in a road in Kensington, London.
