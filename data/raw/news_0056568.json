Like Kristen Stewart, we welcome the smoky remains of the previous evening's kohl eyeliner. However, the latest lived-in makeup look is a liiittle more unorthodox. This, because it literally mimics the aftermath of a kiss. And not a seemly smack on the lips, either—we're talking a full-on, Rose-and-Jack-in-a-fogged-up-luxury-automobile rendezvous.

Similar to the blurred lip look , it's a matter of deliberately coloring outside the lines for an unapologetic, I-just-had-someone-else's-tongue-down-my-throat effect. A post shared by ValGarland (@thevalgarland) on Feb 21, 2017 at 4:06am PST Most Popular To create the look, Garland painted on MAC's highly-pigmented Lip Mix creams , then used a large makeup brush to buff it outside the bounds of the lip line.

But if you love a statement, it will definitely have onlookers using their imagination. A post shared by ValGarland (@thevalgarland) on Feb 20, 2017 at 1:45am PST Not a lip girl? Don't worry—there's another, even more scandalous way to wear last night's kiss on your face. The \"glitter snog\" kicks thing up a notch with a wet nose and glistening chin situation, which is either really sexy or really not depending on how you look at it.
