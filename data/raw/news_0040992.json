Jeff Flake’s decision to not hold any town-hall meetings in recent weeks.\nDespite the rain, more than 30 people gathered at Val Vista Drive and McLellan Road in an attempt to show the Republican senator they were unhappy with his public inaccessibility.\n“Jeff Flake hasn’t held a town hall; he’s not listening to us,” said Naomi Ellis, a protester who held the American flag high. “He represents us, but he’s not listening to our feelings, and our thoughts, and our opinions and our voice.”\nMoms Demand Action and Arizonans Against Trump organized the #searchforFlake event. Flake has not scheduled any town-hall meetings in February or March and advocates have kept his voicemail boxes full . Despite being a vocal critic of Trump during the election, Flake has become the target of anti-Trump activists by supporting Trump's nominees, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\n“He’s not giving people an opportunity to speak up and let people have an opportunity to have their voice,” said Gracie McGill, who spontaneously joined the protest on her way home from volunteering.\nThe protesters started marching in the direction of the senator’s house while chanting their demand for a town-hall meeting. Flake wasn't at home at the time. According to his Twitter account, he was at Phoenix Children's Hospital.\nWonderful visit at @PHXChildrens Hospital this morning. pic.twitter.com/Z04AOBT53P \n— Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) February 18, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:27:50.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
