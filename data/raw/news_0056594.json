Michael McLaughlin & Josh Morgan The Huffington Post Josh Morgan/ The Huffington Post A man wearing a press ID steps in front of advancing law enforcement at the Ocetia Sakowin camp near a section of the Dakota Access Pipeline. \nCANNON BALL, N.D. — Officers arrested 23 Dakota Access Pipeline protesters on Thursday after they defied a Wednesday deadline to leave the camp, North Dakota law enforcement told The Huffington Post. \nRoughly 50 “water protectors” had remained in Oceti Sa`kowin camp before law enforcement swept in to apprehend some of the holdouts. Authorities appeared to restrain protesters with plastic handcuffs before placing them inside utility track vehicles that carried detainees up a hill. \nOfficials had also driven bulldozers and armored vehicles into the camp on federal lands near the Standing Rock Sioux’s reservation and a disputed section of the pipeline. \nSome protesters fled the camp by walking across the frozen Cannonball River toward the Rosebud camps, where members of the Standing Rock Sioux and their supporters have also congregated. Josh Morgan/ The Huffington Post Authorities in North Dakota face Dakota Access Pipeline protesters on Wednesday after a deadline to evacuate federal land had passed. \nThe camp has for months served as a base for protests against the pipeline, which the Sioux and their supporters argue violates their treaty rights and could contaminate their water source. The Morton County sheriff’s department has arrested more than 700 protesters since last summer. \nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R) and the Army Corps of Engineers had ordered the camp to be emptied by Wednesday afternoon. They cited health and safety risks, as the area will likely flood from melting snow and possibly pollute nearby rivers with debris and waste from the camp. \nAuthorities also arrested “approximately 10” people on Wednesday after the deadline passed to vacate the site. \nPhotographer Josh Morgan contributed reporting from North Dakota. \nThis is a developing story.
