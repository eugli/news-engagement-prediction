Lombardi Trophy. (Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports) \nOwner Robert Kraft accepted his fifth Lombardi Trophy from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell without incident following the New England Patriots' thrilling 34-28 overtime victory over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. \nGoodell, who's steered clear of the Patriots since suspending quarterback Tom Brady for his alleged role in Deflategate and was lustily booed Sunday at Houston's NRG Stadium, shook Kraft's hand and handed him the trophy on a field level podium. Goodell also shook hands with Kraft's son, Jonathan, before receding into the background. \n“Two years ago when we won our fourth Super Bowl,\" said Kraft, \"I told our fans that was the sweetest. A lot has transpired in the last two years. And I don’t think that needs explanation.\" \nThe Patriots won Super Bowl XLIX, which was played immediately following the opening stages of the Deflategate controversy that originally surfaced after the 2014 AFC Championship Game, two years ago in Arizona. \n\"But I want to say to our fans, our brilliant coaching staff, our amazing players who are so spectacular,\" continued Kraft, \"this is unequivocally the sweetest. And that's why we are saying for the fifth time, we are all Patriots. For the fifth time the Patriots are all champions.\" \nKraft first uttered \"we are all Patriots\" after the team's first championship in Super Bowl XXXVI, just months after the Sept. 11 attacks. \n“It’s all about these players, we got great players, they’re tough and they compete,\" said New England coach Bill Belichick. \"We thought they’d compete for 60 minutes, but it took more tonight.\" \nPHOTOS: Super Bowl LI A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
