Since then, the two have grown up to be two of Bollywood's most wanted actors and of course, great friends. \nAlia and Varun shared the couch yesterday on Koffee With Karan and the Badrinath Ki Dulhania stars brought the house down with their easy-going chemistry and snappy banter. \nWATCH BADRINATH KI DULHANIA TRAILER: \nHere are five revelations about Alia and Varun from the latest episode of Koffee With Karan: \n1. Varun Dhawan thinks he can be President \nAt one point in the episode, Varun Dhawan asked Karan Johar if he could just stand up and talk. To this Karan asked, \"But why? There is no audience here. Why are you addressing the country? Are you the President or what?\" Varun answered, \"I am next in line.\" Can't blame him. If Donald Trump can... \n2. Alia Bhatt scratches Varun Dhawan \nSpeaking about the sibling-like behaviour between Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt, Karan Johar asked them if they get violent with each other on set. Varun replied, \"She (Alia) gets violent. She scratches me. Ask my spot boy.\" Now, that's 50 shades of chemistry! \n3. Varun, like Alia, likes to be blown by a fan too \nTo cheer Alia Bhatt up, Varun Dhawan used a hair dryer on Alia Bhatt. A confused KJo asked what is happening. Varun said, \"Alia needs a fan in front of her face before every single shot. Because of her, even I've got this habit.\" Karan, never the one to miss out on inneundos, asked, \"You also want to be blown?\" Varun was like, \"Sometimes, yeah.\" Relatable, bro. \n4. Varun wants the baby girl of Shahid Kapoor \nNot creepy as it sounds though. When asked what Shahid Kapoor has that he does not, Varun answered, \"He has a baby girl.\" When he realised, that that comment could go south, Varun quickly added, \"I mean I want a baby of my own, not his baby. Shahid, your child is yours. I don't want your child.\" \n5. Varun's GK is a sux \nRemember, many many ages ago, making memes of and taking digs at Alia Bhatt's (alleged) dumbness was a thing? Well, this time, Varun was on the wrong side when Karan asked him to name three current chief ministers of India. Varun could only say MISTER Fadnavais, THE Chief Minister of Maharashtra.
