More than 40% of claims were received by a handful of male orders. \nThey included compensation, treatment, legal and other costs, said Gail Furness, the lead lawyer assisting the commission in Sydney. Numbers 'likely to be greater' \n\"The royal commission's experience is that many survivors face barriers which deter them from reporting abuse to authorities and to the institution in which the abuse occurred,\" Ms Furness said. \n\"Accordingly, the total number of incidences of child sexual abuse in Catholic Church institutions in Australia is likely to be greater than the claims made.\" Media caption Abuse survivor Andrew Collins gives his reaction to the findings \nThe average delay between an alleged abuse and it being reported was 33 years, she said. \nEarlier this month, the commission heard 7% of the nation's Catholic priests allegedly abused children between 1950 and 2010. \nReflecting on the findings, abuse survivor Andrew Collins told the BBC it had been \"drummed into his head\" by the four men who abused him between the ages of seven and 14 - two teachers, a priest and a Catholic Brother - that he was the one who had \"done wrong\". \n\"I did try to tell my mum once and she said it was absolute rubbish and a man of God would never do such a thing,\" he said. Long-running inquiry \nThe commission has previously heard harrowing testimony from scores of people who suffered abuse at the hands of clergy. \nOne victim said he was sexually abused by his Catholic Christian Brother teacher in his classroom, with other students ordered to look away.
