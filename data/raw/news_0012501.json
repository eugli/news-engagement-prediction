More Albertans are supporting the local food movement \nCultivating Connections is about gathering people from Alberta’s regional food systems to identify ways to collaborate and inspire initiatives. The forum features 20 sessions, two keynote speakers and a total of 80 speakers, with 75 coming from Alberta. \nRoberts said the forum is part of an active movement in the province at finding ways to make the regional food system healthier. But more needs to be done for all Albertans to embrace the movement. \n“People aren’t thinking about their food. We’re too busy. We’re taking our kids to hockey. We’re doing all of our different things. We’re not taking the time to think about our food. We’re more fast food oriented, and that will change,” Roberts said. \n“That’s our purpose: bring people together, talk about food. What do we think needs to be changed to make us spiritually, physically and mentally healthy. That’s the conversation, so it’s all about chatting and chewing.” \nOf particular interest for Roberts is to see Albertans eat less food that’s processed. \n“It’s a matter of how do we get things in place and an infrastructure in place to make that happen,” she said. \nThe Cultivating Connections form is being held at the Expo Centre and runs until Sunday. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T09:49:16.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
