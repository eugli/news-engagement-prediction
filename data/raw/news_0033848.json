In an unexpected move, the Buffalo Planning Board Monday night unanimously approved Jemal’s mixed-use redevelopment of the east and west annexes of the 1.2 million-square-foot, 38-story office tower that dominates the downtown Buffalo skyline. Enlarge Courtesy: Douglas Development “Right now, (the tower) is so ugly that what’s being proposed is really a move up,” said Michael Rembis , a planning board member. “It’s long overdue,” added Martha Lamparelli , another board member. Jemal is proposing to bring 183 market rate apartments to the western, four-story annex - the tower’s wing that’s closest to Pearl Street - and a mix of retail, restaurants and other destination drivers to the eastern four-story annex that overlooks Washington Street and Coca-Cola Field. Also planned for the eastern annex and plaza is a two-story retail-based building. The two annexes will be connected by an elevated, glass-enclosed two-story walkway that traverses Main Street and the Metro Rail tracks. “Let’s give the building some eye appeal,” Jemal said of his plans. “It’s time to put some lipstick on (the building).” In all, Jemal expects to invest more than $100 million in his project - the developer’s first venture in the Buffalo market. He bought the vacant tower and an adjoining Exchange Street parking ramp last fall, paying $12.6 million. His acquisition and development plans help answer a major question lingering in downtown and Buffalo City Hall for more than three years. It also gives the building, the largest office structure in Upstate New York,a certain future. Jemal admits his redevelopment plan is ambitious but is very doable, he said. “You walk around it now and it is nothing but a desert,\" Jemal said. “But come back in five years and you will see a very vibrant building.” Jemal and his development team including Adam Walters , a Phillips Lytle partner and the developer’s attorney for the One Seneca project, said the idea is to transform a stark, 1970s- era office tower into a more welcoming building. Plans include addressing the wind-driven plaza that poses almost a year-round challenge. “The plaza is very pedestrian unfriendly because it is so wind challenged,” Walters said. Design plans are addressing the wind issue including creating a “drop off road” along the eastern plaza that will run from Seneca to Main street. Landscaping, benches and decorative lighting fixtures may also help. Other wind screening plans are being considered. “We are freshening up the look of the building and trying to break up that bleak mess,” Walters said. The building’s facade will be changed with a series of glass, canopies, stucco and metal panels. “The intent is to change the look and feel of the building rather dramatically,” Walters said.
