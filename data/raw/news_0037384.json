Picture courtesy: Twitter/AsmaShahid15 \nThere's some good news for Shararat fans. The fantasy-comedy show that had enjoyed a good run for more than four years on Indian television might soon be back on the small screen. Actress Shruti Seth recently posted a photo with Karanvir Bohra with a note that said -- \"Getting ready for season 2 of #shararat.\" \nThe show was inspired by an American sitcom Sabrina--The Teenage Witch. It (Shararat) was about a magical family headed by Rani Devi, who had a boon that the first born female of her family would inherit magical powers on her 18th birthday. Here are some of the treasured relationships from the show that spelled magic on small screen. \nJiya and Nani Jiya and Nani in a still from the show. Jiya (played by Shruti Seth) and Nani's (played by Farida Jalal) jodi was a big hit. Jiya, who'd inherited magical powers, could never keep out of trouble, and every time she was caught in a tricky situation, Nani came to her rescue. Nani personified warmth and love. And her relationship with Jiya was just aww-dorable. We love you Nani!\nRadha and Suraj Radha and Suraj in a still from the show. Jiya's parents Radha (Poonam Narula) and Suraj Malhotra (Mahesh Thakur) were a great couple. \nRadha respected her husband's wish and didn't use her magical powers, while Suraj, who had his issues with magic, understood the needs of his wife. They were understanding and supportive of each other. Now that is what makes a couple great! \nJiya and Dhruv Jiya and Dhruv in a still from the show. Jiya and Dhruv (played by Karanvir Bohra) made a cute on-screen pair. They portrayed the picture-perfect teen romance in the sitcom. Admit it ladies, Dhruv was the perfect boyfriend. \nSuraj and Nani Nani and Suraj in a still from the show. Suraj and Nani shared a Tom and Jerry kind of relationship. Suraj didn't like the use of magic in his house but Nani deliberately performed magic tricks on him just to annoy him. Their banters were the best.
