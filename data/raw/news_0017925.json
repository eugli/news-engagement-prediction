The bison were transported via shipping containers.

The return of bison to the landscape represents hope for nature and is an important step toward reconciliation with indigenous people.” \nRELATED: Bison survives lightning strike, thrives in wildlife refuge; photo \nThe Herald reported that the Samson Cree Nation hosted “a send-off ceremony” at Elk Island National Park, the origin of the 16 transplanted bison, and other First Nations celebrated the return of bison to Banff National Park. \n“The restoration of wild bison to Banff National Park is a great leap forward for buffalo peoples,” Leroy Little Bear, a Blood Tribe member integral to the historic 2014 Buffalo Treaty signed by 21 First Nations, told the Calgary Herald.

From there the bison-filled containers were airlifted by helicopter to Panther Valley. The bison were released into an enclosed pasture where they will be monitored for 16 months by Parks Canada officials. \nIf all goes as planned, in June 2018 the herd will be released into a 745-square-mile reintroduction zone in the remote eastern slopes of Banff where they will “fulfill their missing role in the ecosystem,” Parks Canada said.
