She refused to provide further information, citing the ongoing investigation of the threats. \nA Chicago FBI spokesman cited the earlier statement as all the information being released by the FBI regarding the threats. \nOn Monday, the community centers in Amherst and Buffalo, N.Y., were evacuated immediately following the threat phoned in to the Amherst facility. Law enforcement officials searched both buildings, nothing was found, and both centers reopened within 2 1/2 hours. \nThe bomb threat was made at about 11:15 a.m., according to Amherst Assistant Police Chief Charles Cohen. Everyone in the building was evacuated to a nearby location, and the all-clear alert was sounded around 12:45 p.m. \n\"The NFTA dog helped us with a sweep,\" Cohen said. \"Areas where we couldn't get a dog in were visually checked by officers and staff.\" \nIn Buffalo, evacuees were taken to a nearby building. After Buffalo police investigated, the facility reopened by 1:30 p.m., according to witnesses on the scene. \n\"They accomplished what they wanted,\" local JCC Executive Director Richard A. Zakalik said of the people coordinating the threats. \"The whole point was to scare and disrupt. Nevertheless, we take it very seriously, and we follow the procedures and protocols that are in place.\" \nZakalik thanked County Executive Mark Poloncarz, the State Police and other law-enforcement agencies that have reached out to help establish those procedures. And in a written statement to JCC members, Zakalik also praised his staff's professional actions and the members' cooperation in evacuating so quickly. \n— The Buffalo News via Tribune Content Agency; the Chicago Tribune's Liam Ford contributed.
