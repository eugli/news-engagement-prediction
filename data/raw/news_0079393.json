Appearing confused, Warren Beatty first looked at the envelope and then handed it to Dunaway. \nShock and chaos spread through the Dolby Theatre when producers of “La La Land” were stopped in the middle of their acceptance speeches to be informed that Dunaway had incorrectly read “La La Land” as the winner. \nHost Jimmy Kimmel came forward to inform the cast that “Moonlight” had indeed won, showing the envelope as proof. \nProducer Jordan Horwitz then graciously passed his statue to the “Moonlight” producers. \nThe antics did little to bolster TV audiences, however: the Oscars telecast drew an average audience of just under 33 million and a roughly 13 percent drop in the coveted 18-49 demographic, according to Variety. \nRELATED: Trump Says Political Tone At Oscars Contributed To ‘Best Picture’ Mistake \nWhile the telecast did well in Los Angeles, San Diego and the biggest U.S. cities, the show’s overall 9.1 rating marked the smallest audience in nine years , Variety reported. \nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), which has overseen the Oscars balloting process on behalf of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for decades, issued a statement apologizing for the “error”. \n— PwC LLP (@PwC_LLP) February 27, 2017 \nAccording to the statement, the “presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.” \nHours before the mistake went viral, PWC tweeted out an image of its staffers watching over the envelopes. \nPresenter Warren Beatty was even photographed holding the envelope clearly labeled “Actress In A Leading Role”.
