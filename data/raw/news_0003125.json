They are not an opposition, they are cheerleaders. \n\"The Liberal Democrats will continue to fight to give the British people the final say on the deal.\" \nTim Farron: The Lib Dem leader said the vote had 'failed future generations' (PA) \nThe Scottish National Party, which is opposed to Brexit, is expected to table dozens of amendments. \nRemain-backers and ultra-Eurosceptics on the Tory backbenches could also attempt to change the Bill. \nBut with the majority of the Labour Party fundamentally supporting the triggering of Article 50 by April in line with the Prime Minister's timetable, she will be confident of getting the Bill through relatively unscathed. Disheartened: Caroline Lucas vowed to protect envrionmental issues (PA) \nGreen Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said she would do everything she can to guarantee environmental and social protections, as well as try to keep the UK in the single market and customs union and protect EU nationals' rights. \n\"Tonight's vote is a body blow for the fight against the Government's extreme Brexit, and has handed the Tories a massive advantage,\" she said. \n\"Watching so many Labour MPs troop through the yes lobby with the Tories was truly disheartening. Theresa May announces Brexit white paper \n\"The Conservatives are set to benefit hugely from rushing through this vote with as little dissent as possible and it's given them far more opportunity to morph a narrow referendum result in favour of leaving the EU into an overwhelming mandate to depart from the world's biggest trading zone, wrecking our social and environmental protections along the way.\" \nThird reading, the Bill's final Commons stage, is also expected on Wednesday February 8, giving MPs a final chance to say whether they approve of the Bill before it passes to the House of Lords, where the stages are repeated. \nThe Government could find life more tricky in the upper chamber, where the Bill will be introduced on February 20, because it does not have a majority. Brexit vote: The bill was passed with a clear majority (PA) \nLabour in the Lords has already said it will examine but not block the Government's Brexit plans, although some individual peers are likely to register their opposition. 47 Labour MPs defy Corbyn and vote against Brexit Bill \nBut the Lib Dems, who are determined to guarantee a fresh referendum , have 102 peers compared with 253 Tories out of a total 805. \nThe Bill is expected to complete its passage through the Lords by Tuesday March 7 but if peers have made amendments, it will return to the Commons, where MPs will debate whether to keep the changes or get rid of them. \nThis procedure, known as \"ping-pong\", would see the Bill repeatedly move between the Commons and the Lords until an agreement is reached on the final text. George Osborne takes swipe at Government over Brexit strategy \nPing-pong seems the most likely stage for the Bill to be held up as peers could become emboldened with time running out for the Government to hit its timetable. \nBut members in both Houses will be acutely aware that appearing to frustrate the progress of the Bill would risk accusations that they are going against the will of the people expressed in last year's referendum. \nAnd peers have also been warned to \"tread carefully\" and not seek to delay the Bill, given they are unelected parliamentarians.
