Vaughn Correctional Center, said Jayme Gravell, a Department of Correction spokeswoman.\nIn a news release, the Department of Correction said law enforcement officials were at the center responding to a hostage situation.\nUSA TODAY\nInmate on bashing cellmate's head: 'He wouldn't die'\nDelaware state Rep. William Carson, a member of the House Corrections Committee, said he had been told it was an “apparent hostage situation.”\n“The inmates have taken over a building,” he said.\nCarson said details were still scarce and said he had no more information.\nAround 2 p.m. ET, The News Journal r eceived a call from a woman who said her fiancé is an inmate at the prison and is being held hostage. A man’s voice was patched onto the line and he said he was asked by hostage takers to relay demands to The News Journal.\n\"They just need somebody to hear their demands,\" said the voice on the other end of the line belonging to someone who was unwilling to give his name because he'd been instructed not to.\nBut the demands that followed made little sense. What was clear was the message the hostage takers meant involved prison reforms.\nDOC have officially confirmed that it's a hostage situation at Vaughn Correctional Center. #netde pic.twitter.com/jArSxOESh9 \n— Brittany Horn (@brittanyhorn) February 1, 2017 The Department of Correction released no other details about the situation. Gravell said it is protocol to lock down all state prisons when an emergency occurs at one of them.\nFirefighters were called to the prison for men in southern New Castle County, Del., but it wasn't immediately known what prompted the call, Gravell said.\nAccording to the Associated Press, Geoffrey Klopp, president of the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware, said he had been told by the Department of Correction commissioner that prison guards had been taken hostage.\nWhile few details have been released, officials will surely review what procedures were in place that created this situation as they did when inmate Scott A. Miller abducted and raped a prison counselor on July 12, 2004.\nMiller, a convicted serial rapist, was serving a 699-year prison sentence at the Delaware Correctional Center — now Vaughn Correctional Center — when he passed through two security checkpoints armed with a homemade knife before taking the prison counselor hostage for nearly seven hours, sexually assaulting her during the ordeal. The counselor is not being named because she was a victim of sexual assault.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Photos: Hostage situation at Delaware prison   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

News Journal the prison counselor didn’t think anything had been done.\nShe and the state finalized a $1.65 million out-of-court settlement in 2006.\nContributing: The Associated Press.
