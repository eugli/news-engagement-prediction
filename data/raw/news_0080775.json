Editor Advertisement \nDPM Teo Chee Hean said that Singapore purposely sent younger ministers for the recent delegation to China as a forward-looking move to build relationships that our founding fathers had helped build with China. \nI think this is just another excuse. The delegation was more Singapore's show of backing down after the recent issues with China, where some of our Ministers started slamming China's foreign policy, and China retaliated by their show of strength. These young ministers probably sent there to be taught who is the boss in this region, if by any chance they start to forget and think they can have their own way with other countries like how they have they own way with their own citizens. \nAnyways, this is a working trip for the ministers. Now, when someone goes on working trips, they better bring back some good business. So, this is the same for the Ministers. Don't just go there for holiday, better bring back China investments to Singapore. Just like what Malaysia and Philippine leaders achieved when they visited China. Your pay are many times higher than theirs. Time to work hard. \nGoh A L \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
