Murgatroyd said that she's a little bit nervous to get back to the show so soon after giving birth, but she's going to make sure she does it healthily. \n\"It's going to take a little bit longer to get back up to the fitness that I had before, but I think it's going to be OK,\" she said. \"I'm going to take it slowly and hopefully I have an awesome partner to go through this with.\" \nShe won Season 22 with partner Nyle DiMarco but sat out Season 23 due to her pregnancy. \nFor his part, Chmerkovskiy, who won Season 18 with Meryl Davis , has apparently changed his mind about leaving the show to be a stay-at-home dad , which he said he was going to do in the fall. He joked that he wants to make Murgatroyd's return as difficult and competitive as possible. \nDancing with the Stars Season 24 premieres Monday, March 20 at 8/7c on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:39:51.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
