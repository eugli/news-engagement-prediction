In this photo provided by Vitória Londero, a giant banner saying ‘Refugees welcome’ hangs on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. National Park Service spokesman Jerry Willis said the banner was hung from the public observation deck on Tuesday afternoon. It was taken down more than an hour later. The stunt took place the day the Department of Homeland Security announced expanded immigration enforcement policies .
