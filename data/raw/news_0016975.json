Elizabeth Warren for quoting Coretta Scott King. Warren read King's words criticizing Senator Jeff Sessions when he was considered for a federal judgeship in the mid-1980s. He is now being considered for Attorney General. AP \n\nIt wasn't Sen. Elizabeth Warren who was silenced by her colleagues in the U.S. Senate. It was the late Coretta Scott King.\nThey didn't like what Mrs. King had to say about Donald Trump's pick for attorney general -- Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions.\nDoes something Mrs. King said about Sessions 30 years ago matter today?\nActually, we should be asking ourselves a different question. That is:\nWhy wouldn’t something Coretta Scott King said about Jeff Sessions matter?\nEven if it was 30 years ago.\nHow is that impugning Sessions? Particularly since Sessions has been nominated for the job of the nation’s lawyer, sworn to protect the rights of all people, and according to Mrs. King (and many others) there was a time when Sessions not only failed to protect those rights, but actively worked to thwart them.\nDemocratic Sen. Warren was reading on the Senate floor parts of a letter Mrs. King wrote in 1986 opposing Sessions consideration for a federal judgeship (which he didn’t get). Warren was interrupted by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said she breached Senate rules by reading quotes by King and others about Sessions.\n“The senator has impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama,” McConnell said, before setting up a party-line vote to ban Warren from speaking any more about Sessions.\nSo, have we come to this?\nDo the political demands of Donald Trump mean more than the words of the widow of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.?\nHow is Warren impugning Sessions (a Republican senator) by reading from a letter?\nDoes not the opinion of Mrs. King have some value? Shouldn’t her words carry some weight?\nWhat King said about Sessions Coretta King and her husband, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., during a civil rights march in 1965   (Photo: AP) \nMrs. King opposed Sessions appointment to the bench 30 years ago because as a U.S. Attorney she believed he led what she described as \"politically-motivated voting fraud prosecutions.\"\nThe Washington Post and other news outlets have published the entire letter .\nYou can read it if you’d like.\nThe senators should read it.\nMrs. King wrote in part, \"The irony of Mr. Sessions’ nomination is that, if confirmed, he will be given a life tenure for doing with a federal prosecution what the local sheriffs accomplished twenty years ago with clubs and cattle prods. I believe his confirmation would have a devastating effect on not only the judicial system in Alabama, but also on the progress we have made toward fulfilling my husband’s dream.\"\nBISHOP: Can we trust Jeff Sessions to defend everyone (even Muslims)? \nThe job of Attorney General isn’t a lifetime appointment.\nBut the wrong person in that job can significantly setback the dreams of Dr. King.\nA partisan politician like McConnell can use Senate rules to silence another partisan politician like Warren.\nBut he shouldn’t try to silence Coretta Scott King.\nRepublicans seemed to realize that. Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley picked up where Warren left off and read Mrs. King's letter aloud.\nShe speaks with passion, grace and authority from the grave.\nShe deserves to be heard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:13:48.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
