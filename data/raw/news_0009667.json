Axelrod is widely known for being one of the first musicians to fuse elements of rock, jazz, and R&B during the 1960s and 1970s. His unique style of work has also been sampled by many, many artists in the hip-hop realm, ranging from Lil Wayne (‚ÄúDr. Carter‚Äù) and Mos Def (‚ÄúHip Hop‚Äù) to Dr. Dre (‚ÄúThe Next Episode‚Äù) and Cypress Hill (\"16 Men Till There&apos;s No Men Left\"). Two of his most famous tracks, ‚ÄúHoly Thursday\" and \"The Edge,‚Äù were featured in the Grand Theft Auto IV soundtrack in 2008.\nJust a few of the David Axelrod samples in hip-hop. He was easily one of the most brilliant composers of the last half century. pic.twitter.com/hSnlsPwWx4\n‚Äî Otto Von Biz Markie (@Passionweiss) February 5, 2017 Following reports of Axelrod‚Äôs death, Questlove posted a heartfelt message on Instagram, celebrating the producer‚Äôs work:\n So sad to hear about the passing of musician/composer # DavidAxelrod . He was so immersed in creativity and so pure with his arrangements he WAS hip hop. And understood and appreciated hip hop culture (most cats would get guarded about time moving on & easily take the \"NO \" disposition if they aren&apos;t informed. David embraced and often reached out to producers and beatmakers for cool collabos ) he appreciation for music and his ability to recognize musicianship is what I&apos;ll take from him.
