These aren't your ordinary teenagers. While one, the daughter of producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra and journalist Anupama Chopra, is launching her vividly descriptive, part fantasy part historical novel, The House That Spoke , the other is basking in the massive success of her Bollywood debut in the Aamir Khan-starrer Dangal . At the launch of Chopra’s book, the teens get talking about what sets them apart and find several things in common instead. Getting creative Zuni Chopra: I really love waking up in the morning, sitting on my bed with the window open, not having to think of anything else while I’m writing. What do you think were the differences between our creative processes? When you’re writing it’s something you do mostly by yourself, but when you’re doing a movie, you’ve got to wake up at five and work with a bunch of people you might not even like! Zaira Wasim: I really need my space too. Before a difficult scene, I sit in a dark room or in my vanity van and try to comprehend what’s coming up next. Sometimes you’ve got to wake up early in the morning, but once you start developing a love for your work, it doesn’t matter what time you’ve to wake up. At the launch of Zuni Chopra's book — House That Spoke . ZC: What kind of research did you do for the film? ZW: I did practically no research. I was just called for an Aamir Khan movie and I did as I was told. ZC: I should try that! Clearly, I’m doing everything wrong. On Kashmir ZW: Why did you decide to set the book in Kashmir? ZC: The story was originally based in London, because the house I’ve written about is there. But I don’t like London much so I couldn’t really write about it with passion. So Mom suggested Kashmir. We used to visit once every year, because dad grew up there. But I’d assume that’s very different from what it was like for you growing up there and for me growing up in Mumbai. In fact, one of the reasons why there are so many vivid descriptions is because whenever I see anything that’s mildly beautiful naturally I’m blown away. For you it must be so…meh. ZW: Oh I really miss the beauty of Kashmir now! ZC: I can imagine. So when I set it in Kashmir, the story had a whole other vibrance to it. I really hope you don’t read it and say, that’s just rubbish, that doesn’t happen! Because you’re actually the protagonist I’m trying to portray in terms of how she’s grown up. Growing up ZC: What is it really like growing up in Kashmir? I just used my imagination and research. ZW: I think I’m the wrong person to answer this question. My life has been different from what a 16-year-old’s life should be like. I don’t go out much. I’ll give you an example – there’s a huge hill right opposite my house and I’ve never been up that hill. Now growing up in Kashmir is pretty much the same as it is in Mumbai or Delhi perhaps. You might find a difference in opinions and ideologies, but that’s it. Hair-raising truths ZC: People might not believe this, but having short hair can be a serious problem. That’s one thing we’ve both been through. ZW: Yes! I was on the sets one day, we had just started shooting after my hair was cut. A little boy comes up to me and says, \"Eh tu Aamir Khan movie mein hai na, eh bhaiya mere saath photo kech na.\" I was so taken aback. I didn’t talk to anyone – I just sat in my van and didn’t come out for an hour. ZC: I was in the ladies room. I was washing my hands not trying to be in the way of the screaming child in the corner. And then he goes, \"Mommy, he’s not even supposed to be here!\" But at least no one mistakes you for a boy anymore. I don’t want to grow mine out because it’ll be like a weird Indian-Afro style. Source of inspiration ZC: What inspires you to make great art as opposed to just snapchatting all day? ZW: I use Snapchat all the time! Nothing really inspires me! I’m so boring. I really should get out of the social media space. What inspires you to write? ZC: When you write a story worth telling, people can actually enjoy it and have it become part of their life in a way that you would’ve never even guessed. When a story becomes worth telling, that’s when you know that you should write it. ZW: Not to sound cheesy, but you really inspire me. Ever since I’ve met you, I have been in awe of you. ZC: Ok, that was not planned. I did not know you were going to say this. Oh god, now I’ve to respond correctly! And be all politically correct. ZW: I get you. That I understand completely! ZC: I’ve got nice quote to wrap up. I guess this is what inspires me. It’s from Midnight in Paris . Judi Dench’s character (Gertude Stein) says, “We all fear death and question our place in the universe. The artist’s job is not to succumb to despair, but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T10:26:10.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
