However, a new study has revealed that creativity does not depend on a single side of the brain, but how well the two hemispheres communicate with each other. Researchers have discovered that those who are highly innovated have more nerve connections between the right and left brain. Scroll down for video A study has suggested that creativity does not depend on a single side of the brain, but how well the two hemispheres communicate with each other. Researchers have discovered that those who are highly innovated have more nerve connections between the right and left brain, pictured here STUDY RESULTS Researchers analyzed 68 brain regions in healthy college-age participants. Participants were given certain tasks to complete during tests while being monitored. This included problem solving tasks, drawing geographic designs for five minutes and listing new uses for everyday objects. Finally, participants had to fill out a questionnaire about their achievements in ten creative areas. There was not a statistical difference in connectivity within hemispheres, or between men and women. The team found that when they compared people who scored in the top 15 percent on the tests to the bottom 15 percent, those in the higher bracket showed a more significant connection between the right and left hemisphere. And these differences were witnessed mainly in the brain's frontal lobe. The study was conducted by David Dunson of Duke University and Daniele Durante of the University of Padova, who analyzed the network of white matter connections among 68 separate brain regions in healthy college-age participants. The brain's white matter sits underneath the outer grey matter and is composed of bundles of wires, or axons, which connect billions of neurons and carry electrical signals between them. The data was collected using an MRI technique called diffusion tensors imaging, which gives researchers the ability to look through the skull of a living person and trace the paths of all the axons by following the water moving along them â€“ this was conducted by a team led by neuroscientist Rex Jung of the University of New Mexico. Computers then sifted through each of the 1-gigabyte scans and converted them to three-dimensional maps - wiring diagrams of the brain. Jun and his team, while they used the MRI, ask hte volunteers to participate in specific tests to assess each person's creativity. These tests included problem solving tasks, drawing geographic designs for five minutes and listing new uses for everyday objects, such as a paper clip.
