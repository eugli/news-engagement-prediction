Released Jan. 20, the track captured 740,000 U.S. streams and sold 1,000 downloads in its first tracking week, according to Nielsen Music. \"Soon\" is the second chart hit for Noyes, who is familiar to fans as the vocalist on Kygo ’s \"Stay,\" which hit No. 8 in December 2015. Additionally, \"Soon\" ranks at No. 12 on the Spotify Viral 50 and No. 21 on the Billboard + Twitter Emerging Artists chart. \nThomas Gold featuring Jillian Edwards, \"Magic\" \nGerman DJ/producer Thomas Gold grabs his first appearance on Hot Dance/Electronic Songs, debuting at No. 50 with \"Magic.\" The track features vocals from folk singer Jillian Edwards , who has reached No. 6 twice on the Americana/Folk Albums chart, first with EP Headfirst in 2011 and then with the full-length Daydream in 2014. \"Magic\" marks her first Billboard dance/electronic chart appearance. It also manages a No. 18 position on the Spotify Viral 50. \nAustra, Future Politics \nCanadian act Austra achieves the top debut on the consumption-based Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart with Future Politics (2,000 equivalent album units).
