Chinese President Xi Jinping - 20-23 October 2015 The idea is to hire a major stadium in Birmingham, Cardiff or even Wembley and to bring everyone together in a massive rally to celebrate the special relationship between the US and the UK Inside source The source added: “Trump is a huge supporter of the military so the plan would be to charge people £10 to attend with all the proceeds going to the Poppy appeal. “It would be a triple win. Trump loves rallies; it would be a win for the British public and a win for the Royal British Legion, of which the Queen is patron. “The only person who gets screwed is the Speaker of the House of Commons.” Insiders say Mr Bercow may have orchestrated the row to keep him in the post until 2020 by currying favour with the Left by vetoing a speech in Westminster Hall.

Among those who would be invited to appear alongside Mr Trump at the rally include members of the Churchill family. It has also been suggested that there could be a role for the Red Arrows as well as the country’s foremost military bands.

The idea for the rally has been fed back to the White House and has won favour with the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in talks on Wednesday, the source claimed.

In 2015 then PM David Cameron joined the Indian leader Narendra Modi on stage at a rally in Wembley hours after his guest had had lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace. Mr Trump, who has spoken repeatedly about his admiration for the Queen, is expected to visit Britain this summer – although no date has yet been confirmed.
