We heard from multiple sources that WWE management did not appear to have been happy with Rock going in that direction with his live promo to the crowd in Los Angeles. \n\"At one point, it appeared someone was sent to ringside to ask Rock to go in another direction. At one point, a fan yelled they were going to turn his mic off and Rock responded, \"They better not turn off my mic.\" \nThe chances of The Rock being punished by the WWE for his actions after Raw finished last night is practically zero because he is at such an untouchable status within the company. He makes them money whenever he returns, so why would they want to punish him now around WrestleMania; the most important time of the year for the business. \nYou can understand why they might be frustrated with The Great One, as the WWE's relationship with Punk isn't very strong at all, and this incident has created unnecessary publicity about it. However, as PWInsider says in their report, it may benefit the company in the long run. \n\"One can understand why the company wasn't thrilled with Rock publicly putting over Punk in front of 15,000 fans in one of WWE's top markets, although it made for a 'can you believe this?' moment that obviously energized the audience going into the film shoot, which was only going to help with reactions for the footage the production sought to capture.\" \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
