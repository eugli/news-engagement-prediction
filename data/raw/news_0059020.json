This year, the vibrant event was hosted at Camden’s Roundhouse. Her inner circle—including Liv Tyler , Karlie Kloss , Stella McCartney , and Lara Stone —enjoyed a night of high-rolling fun and philanthropy, raising nearly $585,000. All the money will go toward the charity’s programs to develop a network of support services for families raising children with special needs and to create inclusive play facilities for children of all abilities. “I’m thrilled that the Fabulous Fund Fair has become such an exciting and anticipated part of London’s social scene and certainly one of the most Instagrammable charity events,” said Vodianova, declaring the fair officially open in a red dress and playful orange star-shaped sunglasses (like a more stylish, groovier version of the dancing emoticon). The color-pop fair was designed by artist Camille Walala in association with luxury houses, and included chic tarot readings from the refined Kristin Scott Thomas (who saw lots of Fendi in our future wardrobes) and a Louis Vuitton airplane toss with a playfully on-form Doutzen Kroes. A very popular Tyler hosted Maxx Royal Resorts’ Coconut Shy, and after an amazing return this season (The Row, Erdem), raven-haired beauty Erin O’Connor hosted Dior’s Lucky Star. Truffled hot dogs were on the menu, along with chilled Dom Pérignon (with the charming English rose Clara Paget presiding over spin the bottle with the empties). Before the style set makes their way to Milan, there was time for one last turn . . . on the beautiful carousel, where the way to best travel was sidesaddle to show off those Valentino gowns to their full advantage.
