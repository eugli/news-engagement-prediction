Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Perrie Edwards ’ footballer boyfriend Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has joked he better watch himself if he doesn’t want to be the subject of any future Little Mix anthems.\nThe BRIT Award-winning band’s latest song is the girl power filled Shout Out To My Ex, inspired by, well, all their ex-boyfriends over the years.\nAmong the feisty lyrics is a dig at ‘faking it’ with exes when it comes to the bedroom department: “I hope she gettin’ better sex / Hope she ain't fakin’ it like I did, babe.”\nPerrie and Alex after the BRITs (Photo: Instagram) Perrie performing in February (Photo: Getty Images) “I better watch out!” Alex joked to The Sun on Sunday .\n“I don't want her to become an ex and sing about me. Probably something about Arsenal being rubbish. I better look after her.”\nThere seems little chance of Perrie writing a break up song about Alex given how loved up they looked at the BRIT Awards last week.\nThere's no denying they make one very good looking couple.\nFollowing Little Mix's success on Wednesday night, the pair both took to social media to share two very loved-up shots.\nAlex was first to post the suited and booted snap of him and his lady posing for camera.\nA few hours later, blonde stunner Perrie also shared one of her own, which was almost identical apart from the fact she has her hand delicately placed on her stomach in hers.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BQ35m19FNhA/?taken-by=perrieedwards&hl=en/embed https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ3fDqXD6Sh/?taken-by=alexoxchamberlain&hl=en/embed \"What a night!\" she wrote alongside it.\nLittle Mix fans inundated the sweet shot with love hearts and compliments about how great they look together.\n\"Georgeous and handsome, perfect match. Congrats on the award,\" one said.\n\"Cutest thing ever y'all look happy and cute together,\" wrote a second.\nThe pair recently made their relationship Instagram official (Photo: Instagram/PerrieEdwards) (Photo: Rex Features) Perrie and Alex also made their feelings for one another very well known on the night, with the Little Mix singer planting a kiss on her boyfriend as she got up to collect her award with her bandmates.\nThe pair, who were first linked back in November, made their romance 'Insta-official' when she uploaded a sweet snap of the Arsenal footballer as he sat next to their dogs at the dinner table a few weeks ago.\n(Photo: Rex Features) Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in Perrie Edwards Snapchats from bed with footballer boyfriend Share this video Watch Next At the BRITs, the girls dedicated their gong to their exes, with Jade telling the crowd: \"Thank you so much.
