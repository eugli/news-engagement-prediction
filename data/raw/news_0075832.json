The company did, however, announce that its next unpacked press conference will be held on March 29 in New York City. It also gave the world the first official teaser of what's in stock: the Galaxy S8 in all probability will be a near bezel-less smartphone. Coming to the MWC announcements now, the Galaxy Tab S3 and the Galaxy Book, have been designed to take on Apple's iPad Pro and Microsoft's Surface. They are basically successors of the popular Galaxy Tab S2 and the Galaxy TabPro S. \nThe Galaxy Book, like the Galaxy TabPro S, is a Windows-based 2-in-1 convertible that comes in two size variants. The larger (and mightier) one of the two comes with a 12-inch full-HD Super AMOLED display and a 7th Gen Intel Core i5 processor under the hood with up to 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB SSD storage, which is also expandable. The smaller Galaxy Book, meanwhile, comes with a 10.6-inch full-HD TFT screen and an Intel Core m3 processor under the hood with up to 4GB of RAM and up to 128GB of eMMC storage, which is again, expandable.

It crams in up to 10 hours of battery life, and supports fast charging, according to Samsung. The 10.6-inch Galaxy Book, meanwhile, comes with a 5-megapixel front camera and only one USB Type-C port for connectivity. \nThe Galaxy Book comes along with a detachable keyboard case and supports stylus input. Both come with significant improvements over their predecessors. While the keyboard case has improved key travel and backlighting, the S Pen now supports over 4,000 levels of pressure sensitivity, comes with a rubberised 0.7mm tip, and never needs a charge. \nThe Galaxy Book comes in Wi-Fi and LTE variants and runs Windows 10 out-of-the-box. Samsung's other tablet, the Galaxy Tab S3, can be considered as a relatively more mainstream affair. It features a slim design and a glass back much like Samsung's top-end Galaxy S phones. The Tab S3 comes with a 9.7-inch Super AMOLED QXGA screen and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor clubbed with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of memory (also expandable) under the hood.\nIt comes with a single USB Type-C port and a 6,000mAh battery with fast charging. \nThe Tab S3, unlike the Tab S2, comes with four speakers (tuned by AKG) and supports stylus input. In fact, it ships with the same S Pen that Samsung supplies with the Galaxy Book. Moreover, it also supports a keyboard case (optional and doesn't ship in the box) which attaches at the bottom of the tablet via a pogo pin. Also Read: Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus launched at MWC 2017, likely to come to India in March \nSamsung also announced an upgraded version (third generation) of the Gear VR headset by adding a handy controller into the mix. \n\"The Gear VR with controller offers 42mm lenses with 101-degree FOV (Field of View) and advanced distortion correction technology to minimize motion sickness. It will support both micro USB and USB Type-C port with a converter in-box. Additionally, the Gear VR will have a strap on the headset to hold the controller when it is not in use,\" the company said in a statement.
