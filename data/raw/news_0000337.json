In 2014 Cuilam bought 24.9 per cent of Linhua, and last year applied to the OIO to buy the company outright. \nPrime Range Meats, which employed 130 workers last year, faced an uncertain future and at one stage had to temporarily close because it did not have sufficient working capital. \nBesides buying the company, Cuilam has also bought four parcels of freehold land comprising 21 hectares at Switzer Street, 38 ha at West Plains Road, 54 ha at Moore Road, and 0.0809 ha at Bond Street. \nREAD MORE: New owners of troubled Prime Range Meats getting senior staff on ground \"urgently\" * Out-of-work Prime Range Meats employees remain in limbo \nThere are a number of companies operating under the Cuilam name in New Zealand, including Cuilam Industry and Cuilam Property Development. \nCuilam Industry changed its name last year from the Shenzhen Ming Sheng Du Ling Commercial and Trading Co, founded in 2007, and mainly involved in goods and materials supply and marketing. \nThe OIO said the investment would provide access to the beef and lamb sector in New Zealand, \"allowing the applicant and parent company to have access to and supply and distribute high quality beef and lamb products in China\". \nThe \"substantial and identifiable benefit to New Zealand\" criteria were satisfied because the investment would provide jobs, increased export receipts, increased efficiency/productivity and additional investment for development purposes. \nFairfax Media has been unable to contact Prime Range Meats for comment. Tony Forde, the managing director, is no longer employed by the company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:02:22.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
