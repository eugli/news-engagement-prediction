PUBLISHED: 00:02, Sat, Feb 18, 2017 | UPDATED: 00:36, Sat, Feb 18, 2017 \nThe arrangement would come as the price of a free trade deal with Britain – after Australia was the first country to offer after last year’s referendum. \nAlexander Downer, the Australian high commissioner, expressed hopes in an interview that his country’s workforce would be able to benefit from a freedom of movement arrangement under Britain’s post-Brexit immigration policy.

We have a non-discriminatory approach to immigration. \n“That means we essentially don’t discriminate between countries and we would have thought that it would be to your advantage and might be to our advantage to have a non-discriminatory approach to Australians.” GETTY Australia would like an EU-style free movement deal, Alexander Downer said. GETTY Mr Downer is an anglophile and veteran statesman. \nMr Downer also mooted that British work visas should be made more easily accessible to Australian businessmen and professionals. \nHe said: “At the moment if you are a taxi driver in Bucharest you have completely free access to the UK, whereas if you are a brain surgeon from Sydney it is harder for you to get into the UK. \n“We would say: ‘how is that contributing to maximising GDP growth?’. We would hope that we might be able to get some improved visa arrangements, for example for Australian professional and business people to work in the UK, along the lines of the agreement we have with the Americans.” GETTY Government officials have started preliminary talks with Australia over a free trade agreement. GETTY Mr Downer said farmer subsidies could put Australia at a disadvantage in agriculture. \nThe high commissioner warned that the “only thing that makes free trade negotiation protracted” is how much a country wants to protect certain industries. \nHe added: “So if the UK wants to protect agricultural industries from competition in Australia, that makes it harder to negotiate a free trade agreement.” \nBritish and Australian officials have met for early discussions on a trade agreement, but talks risk taking a sour turn once negotiations begin proper. BREXIT: Which parts of the UK had the majority vote? Fri, February 17, 2017 Much of the North East of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union including Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, and Northumberland. Newcastle was the only borough to vote to remain, though by a narrow margin, which was likely due to its large student population and dependency on EU funding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:45:02.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
