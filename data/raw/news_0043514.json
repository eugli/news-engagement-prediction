On-pitch melee \nHertha's players surrounded the referee in protest at the goal, while their goalkeeper, Rune Jarstein, retrieved the ball and booted it straight into Xabi Alonso's back which prompted a melee between the two sets of players, as tempers rose. \nBut while the dust may have settled to an extent on the pitch, Ancelotti was caught on camera sticking his middle finger up at the home support - which can be seen in the video below - as he made his way down the steps and towards the away dressing room at full-time. \nAnd that gesture from the former Chelsea boss is set to see the German Football Association take action against the Italian, who has admitted to the incident and explained exactly why he reacted in such a manner. \n\"Yes, I made this gesture as I was spat at earlier,” Ancelotti told ARD Sportschau, per the Independent . \nWhile Neuer reflect on the matter, saying: \"That has nothing to do with fair play, it doesn't matter how frustrated you are. \n“There's a massive crowd here and it's not setting a good example.” \nIt was certainly not a memorable afternoon for Ancelotti on Saturday but, if Bayern continue to pick up points in the way they did in Berlin, it will be very hard to bet against the German giants retaining their title. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
