The ad was months in the making, but landed during a week Donald Trump’s travel ban took center stage, highlighting its very different message. Naturally, that provoked a backlash complete with hashtag: #BoycottBudweiser. \nThe ad follows Anheuser-Busch co-founder Adolphus Busch as he travels to the United States, faces discrimination on account of his nationality and eventually — in dogged pursuit of the American Dream — lands in St. Louis and begins to brew beer. \nWhile a boycott against a staple inexpensive beer over a commercial may fizzle out sooner than some other protests, that certainly didn’t stop people from having some fun with the reaction on social media. How'd your families get here?Trumpsters: \"Immigration\" \n— Craig Rozniecki (@CraigRozniecki) February 5, 2017 Apparently with enough pro-immigrant brand ads, we can reduce the alt-right to living off squirrel meat & pond water #BoycottBudweiser \n— Craig Rozniecki (@CraigRozniecki) February 5, 2017 HAHAHAHA!!! \nLIKE ANY DEPLORABLE WILL BOYCOTT BEER!!!! \nHILLARY COULD BE ON THE CAN AND YOU WILL CHUG IT. \n— Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) February 5, 2017 When you get pissed at Budweiser for reminding you we were ALL once immigrants, you really need to stop reading Breitbart. #BoycottBudweiser \n— Michael Blackman (@ParaComedian09) February 5, 2017 Here's the state by state reaction to the Budweiser immigrant ad. Pretty much as expected. pic.twitter.com/i6cfnAA1aR \n— Dave Lozo (@davelozo) February 5, 2017 i know emotions are running high but just a quick reminder that Budweiser tastes godawful \n— Vann R. Newkirk II (@fivefifths) February 4, 2017 \nBudweiser denied it was purposely making a political statement with its high-profile ad slot, although Trump has made immigration a central campaign issue for more than a year. \n“There’s really no correlation with anything else that’s happening in the country,” Budweiser vice president Ricardo Marques told Adweek . “We believe this is a universal story that is very relevant today because probably more than any other period in history today the world pulls you in different directions, and it’s never been harder to stick to your guns.” 13 Offbeat Super Bowl Prop Bets, From Lady Gaga's Hair to Donald Trump (Photos) \nAmericans bet billions of dollars annually on the Super Bowl, but not all of it is directly on the game itself -- or even anything to do with football. As the New England Patriots prepare to take on the Atlanta Falcons Sunday at Super Bowl LI in Houston, here are some of this year's more unusual prop bets. \nAll lines are courtesy of Bovada.
