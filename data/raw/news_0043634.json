Re-exports refer to goods that are imported into the United States, then transferred to another country. \nTrump has been highly critical of trade deals including the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) with Mexico and Canada . By using a metric that widens the trade deficit, it could give him political leverage to make sweeping changes, the paper reported. \nREAD MORE: Canada could be collateral damage in Trump trade talks: Ambassador \nIf the government adopted the new method, the deficit with Mexico would be nearly twice as high. \nThe Journal reported that career government employees at the U.S. Trade Representative’s (USTR) office objected to a request to prepare data using the new methodology. \nAlthough they complied with the request, the newspaper reported, the staffers explained why they disagreed with the approach. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump’s trade policies could damage the states that elected him: CIBC \nIn a statement to the newspaper, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative’s deputy chief of staff, Payne Griffin, said officials there are not close to a decision yet on whether to adopt a new approach. \n“We had a meeting with the Commerce Department, and we said, ‘Would it be possible to collect those other statistics?'” he was quoted as saying. \nUSTR officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. © 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:13:14.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
