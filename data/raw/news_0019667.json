He has served on Tech’s student-athlete advisory board and helped start a peer-to-peer mentor program that matches upperclassman mentors with freshman athletes to help ease their transition to college.\nHe has also helped implement a workshop to educate incoming freshman athletes about relationship violence. He has also been involved with the athletic department’s annual toy drive, has volunteered at the Ronald McDonald House and teaches Sunday school.\nHow Rand Rowland earned his Georgia Tech scholarship", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:44:26.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
