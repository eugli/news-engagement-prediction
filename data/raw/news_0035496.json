Whereas when you open, you obviously play against the quicker bowlers. \n“But not too much (changes in terms of preparation)... it doesn’t really matter.” \nMarsh opened in his past two Tests, including last year’s dead rubber in Colombo where he embarrassed teammates with a knock of 130.

Smith 107 retired out, S. Marsh 104 retired out; N Saini 2-27, H Pandya 1-64) View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
