Both Selden Standard and Mabel Gray announced plans today to host pop-ups with chef Brad Greenhill. The events will partially serve as fundraisers benefiting the staff from Katoi, which closed suddenly last Friday due to an apparent arson . Selden Standard’s event scheduled for March 8 will feature five Thai-inspired courses by Greenhill, chef Andy Hollyday, and pastry chef Lena Sareini. The meal will also include beverage pairings. Tickets are $100 and diners can choose from two seatings. Then on March 13, Mabel Gray chef James Rigato and Greenhill will serve a collaborative menu at 6 p.m. with an optional cash bar run by the Katoi beverage team. Tickets for that event are also $100. Reservations can be made by calling 248-398-4300. This is the latest fundraising effort for Katoi. Friends and fans moved quickly last weekend to mobilize benefits for the restaurant crew following the fire. A $40,000 GoFundMe has already raised more than $9,000. Katoi plans to rebuild, though it’s unclear when the so-called “mothership” will be back in action.
