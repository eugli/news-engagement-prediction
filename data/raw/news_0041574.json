In the last few days of his life, they took all of his medicine.\n\"Is this America, the land of freedoms? Look how they treated the man who is old, blind, and ill and who came to America to call for freedom. They took the worst revenge against him, only because he used to say the truth. They conspired with the [former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak's] regime against him.\"\nVideo evidence Much of the case against Abdel Rahman, a preacher at a New Jersey mosque, and his followers was based on video and audio recordings made with the help of his bodyguard, who became an FBI informant.\nOne of those videos showed four defendants mixing fertiliser and diesel fuel for bombs.\nAfter a nine-month trial, Abdel Rahman and nine of his followers were found guilty in October 1995 on 48 of 50 charges.\nSix people died in the attack and more than 1,000 people were injured in the attack on February 26, 1993.\nAbdel Rahman was critical of Sadat, left, and accused of plotting to kill Mubarak [DH Kennerly/Getty Images] Abdel Rahman did not testify at his trial but at a sentencing hearing gave a speech of more than 90 minutes, through a translator, proclaiming his innocence and denouncing the US as an enemy of his Islamic faith.\n\"I have not committed any crime except telling people about Islam,\" he said.\nAbdel Rahman remained a spiritual leader for some, even after more than 20 years in prison.\nWith his long grey beard, sunglasses and red and white cap, he was a famous religious figure in the 1980s and 1990s.\nHis following was tied to killings and bomb attacks around the world.\nAbdel Rahman, who was born in a village along the Nile on May 3, 1938, grew up studying a Braille version of the Quran.\nAs an adult, he was accused of issuing a decree leading to the 1981 assassination of Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian president he had criticised for years.\nUS resident status Abdel Rahman said in Egypt he was hung upside-down from the ceiling, beaten with sticks and given electric shocks while held, but he was eventually acquitted and went into self-imposed exile in 1990.\nHe managed to get to New York after the US embassy in Sudan granted him a tourist visa in 1990 - despite the fact that he was on the state department's list of people with \"ties to terror groups\".\nUS authorities blamed a computer error for the visa, but the mistake was compounded in 1991 when Abdel Rahman was given a green card and permanent US resident status.\nThe New York Times reported the CIA had approved the visa application for Abdel Rahman, who had supported the anti-Soviet fighters in Afghanistan during the 1980s.\nAbdel Rahman's convictions also included plotting to kill Mubarak during a visit to the US in 1993, a Jewish New York state legislator and a Jewish New York State Supreme Court justice.\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies\nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:05:59.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
