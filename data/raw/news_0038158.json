And, at one point, went after one person in particular. \nAnswering questions from CNN’s Jim Acosta — who he has called “fake news” in the past — Trump decided to offer up some commentary on one of CNN’s primetime hosts. \nFirst, Trump let it be known that when it came to cable news programs, he liked Fox & Friends best. \n“ Fox & Friends in the morning,” he said “They are very honorable people. Not because they are good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong, but they have the most honest morning show.” \nHe then went after Don Lemon — without explicitly naming him — over the tone of his nightly program. Specifically, the “hatred.” \n“You look at your show that goes on at 10:00 in the evening,” the president exclaimed. “You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump.” \nHe continued, “The good news is he doesn’t have good ratings, but the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth. The hatred coming from other people on your network.” \nWatch the clip above, via CNN. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:18:48.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
