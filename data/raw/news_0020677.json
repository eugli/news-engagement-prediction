Trump responded within minutes, using his preferred medium: SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 \nAn appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is possible. The ban temporarily suspended the nation’s refugee program and immigration from countries that have raised terrorism concerns. Justice Department lawyers argued that the President has the constitutional power to restrict entry to the US. After the lower court ruling, the State Department quickly said people from the seven countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - with valid visas could travel to the US. The decision led to tearful reunions at airports round the country. \nRejecting arguments that the government would be “irreparably harmed” if the judicial system reviewed Trump’s ban, the Court of Appeals determined unanimously that the judiciary has a proper role in safeguarding people’s rights. \nThe court said: \n“To the contrary, while counseling deference to the national security determinations of the political branches. The Supreme Court has made clear that the Government’s authority and expertise in [such] matters do not automatically trump the Court’s own obligation to secure the protection that the Constitution grants to individuals, even in times of war.” The ban was set to expire in 90 days, meaning it could run its course before the court would take up the issue. The administration also could change the order, including changing its scope or duration. \nLast week, thousands of protesters took to the streets across the UK to call on Theresa May to end her “collusion” with Trump. \nDemonstrators urged the Prime Minister to withdraw her controversial invitation of a state visit to Trump and denounced his travel ban as “racist”. \nRelated...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:07:24.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
