Then again, the business magazine doesn’t take into account the world leaders and “dictators who derive their fortunes entirely as a result of their position of power.”\nQuote: s in the article Microsoft Corp MSFT\n▼ 64.49 -0.13 -0.20% DOW $INDU\n▲ 20,743.00 +118.95 +0.58% NASDAQ COMP\n▲ 5,865.95 +27.37 +0.47% S&P 500 Index SPX\n▲ 2,365.38 +14.22 +0.60% If it did, there’d be a new top dog, according to several reports that revisited the idea that Vladimir Putin’s net worth, virtually impossible to measure, tops $200 billion.\nInternational Business Times triggered the latest round of speculation when it resurfaced various guesses as to the degree of Putin’s riches. One source said it’s only about $40 billion, while another put it up near $70 billion.\nThen there’s Bill Browder, a former fund manager in Russia.\n“I believe that [Putin is worth] $200 billion,” he once told CNN . “After 14 years in power of Russia, and the amount of money that the country has made, and the amount of money that hasn’t been spent on schools and roads and hospitals and so on, all that money is in property, bank, Swiss bank accounts, shares, hedge funds, managed for Putin and his cronies.”\n© Provided by Dow Jones & Company, Inc. John Oliver fueled the buzzy topic when he spent the bulk of his “Last Week Tonight” show on HBO this weekend dancing around the Putin topic. Oliver mentioned estimates pegging his wealth at $85 billion, which would put him in a virtual tie with Gates atop the list.\nClick to expand Replay Video Would you pay $18 for a cup of coffee?
