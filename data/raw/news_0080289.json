Daily Edition Oscars Accountants Offer Another Apology as Academy Launches Review of Snafu 7:07 PM PST 2/27/2017 by Gregg Kilday Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel (left) and Warren Beatty PricewaterhouseCoopers says, \"Last night we failed the Academy.\" \nIt’s been less than 24 hours since the most notorious fubar in Oscar history — the mistaken announcement that La La Land had won best picture, when in fact the award was meant for Moonlight — and accounting firm PricewaterhouseCooper has now issued an unusual second apology, while the Academy is announcing that it will conduct a review of the way the tell-tale envelopes are handled at the Oscar ceremony. \nGoing beyond the first statement of apology that was issued Sunday night, three hours after the Oscar broadcast ended, PwC on Monday sent out what it called a “revised statement” in which it squarely shoulders the blame for the incident, cites PwC partner Brian Cullinan for the mistake and offers another apology to all involved in the embarrassing drama that played out on national television. \n“PwC takes full responsibility for the series of mistakes and breaches of established protocols during last night’s Oscars,” the new statement says. “PwC partner Brian Cullinan mistakenly handed the back-up envelope for Actress in a Leading Role instead of the envelope for Best Picture to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. Once the error occurred, protocols for correcting it were not followed through quickly enough by Mr. Cullinan or his partner.” \nCullinan was one of two PwC partners charged with bringing the envelopes to the Dolby Theatre and then handing the appropriate envelope to each presenter as the various categories were called. In the wake of mix-up, it’s since been learned that Cullinan also was tweeting during the event and had tweeted a picture of best actress winner Emma Stone just minutes before he handed the wrong envelope to Warren Beatty. \nThe new PwC statement continues, “We are deeply sorry for the disappointment suffered by the cast and crew of La La Land and Moonlight . We sincerely apologize to Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, Jimmy Kimmel, ABC, and the Academy, none of whom was at fault for last night's errors. We wish to extend our deepest gratitude to each of them for the graciousness they displayed during such a difficult moment. For the past 83 years, the Academy has entrusted PwC with the integrity of the awards process during the ceremony, and last night we failed the Academy.” \nMeanwhile, Academy spokesperson Teni Melidonian said, “We’ve essentially launched a review of the entire process that happens backstage and the way PwC has been handling of the envelopes and how they are carried out at the ceremony.” She emphasized that the Academy’s concern was not about the way PwC conducts the nominating and voting process for the Oscars, but the way it oversees the revelation of the final results at the awards show. She said that process “would be looked at extensively to see what measures need to be evaluated or evolved or completely replaced.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:49:07.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
