Alaina Ferguson, 23, briefly taught algebra from September to October 2016. When a 16-year-old student handed in a test paper with his Snapchat username scribbled on the page, a sexual relationship soon followed. The two began communicating back and forth online, and reports indicate the naughty teacher also sent the young man some nude photos. What began as texting quickly escalated to having sex on a park bench. That encounter then led to a game of beer pong and more sex at Miss Ferguson’s fiancé’s apartment while he was out of town. The two later had sex in the back of a pickup truck after a school football game. Having taught at the school only a couple of months, Miss Ferguson decided to quit her job in October, but continued having sex with the teen in November. When rumors started to swirl at Plano Senior High, Miss Ferguson was arrested by police. Her wedding was also called off, and the arrest warrant noted that she told the student “she knew it was not the right thing to do, but it felt right at the time. And that she was going to break it off with her fiancé because she didn’t feel anything with him.” Miss Ferguson was released on $100,000 bond, and has to wear an electronic monitoring device. She’s also not allowed to use the internet, and was forced to deactivate her social media accounts.\nMedia: MediaOS Video Recently, the Austin American-Statesman examined these numbers more closely and found that between January 2010 and December 2016, 686 teachers in Texas lost their teaching license due to allegations of impropriety with a student, according to information they acquired from the TEA.\nIn the Houston-area's ten largest school districts, roughly 60 teachers lost their licence following impropriety with a student.\nThe newspaper's database of these cases allows users to search districts where and when these incidents occurred.\nHOUSTON-AREA: Woodlands music teacher accused of sexually assaulting children\nClick through above to see some of the teacher-student
