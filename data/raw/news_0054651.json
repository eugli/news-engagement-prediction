Quick Take \nOkay, so who wants to watch two super-buff, tattooed bearded dudes do yoga in the Scottish wilderness? Other than like your mom, your girlfriend and most other women on planet Earth? \nThe proof is in the blood pudding: the BBC’s The Social filmed Dundee yoga instructor Finlay Wilson and Tristan Cameron-Harpe twisting away in super slo-mo in the bucolic settings of rural Scotland, with thumpy drums adding to the sheer primal loin-heating animal impulse of it all. \nWhy exactly they felt the need to film these two dudes looking like much more perfect human specimens while they wear next to nothing is totally baffling, but the video has been viewed on the Social’s Facebook page more than 20 million times. \nThe Social is meant to showcase “comedy, lifestyle & more from fresh talent in Scotland.” In this case it also showcases a couple of Scottish rear ends and what may be the hint of a Scottish testicle, so you've been warned. Own The Conversation \nThese dudes can’t be as perfect as they seem, right? Drop This Fact \nConsider this: Finlay Wilson is also famous because he adopted a stray dog he met while on vacation in Sri Lanka.
