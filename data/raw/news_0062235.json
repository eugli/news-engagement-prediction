Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, chose U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia to be her running mate, ending some speculation that might tap her husband to be on the ticket. \nRelated : Would Bill Clinton Be Eligible to Be Vice President? \nIt is unclear what role the two-term president would play, or even what he would be called (first man?), if Hillary Clinton is elected to the White House. But the topic was fodder for the press as Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president by either of the major political parties. \n\"Putting Mr. Clinton to good use, while containing his less helpful impulses, would be a major test for Mrs. Clinton as president, given the spotlight and pressure they would be under and her limited ability in the past to rein in his excesses,\" The New York Times reported in July 2016. \ncontinue reading below our video Profile of Hillary Clinton Cabinet Position for Bill Clinton? \nTheoretically, the 42nd president of the United States would be eligible to serve in his wife's cabinet, though some legal scholars might raise concerns if she were to nominate him secretary of state . \nWere the former president to be confirmed to secretary of state it would place him in the line of succession to the presidency, and should his wife and her vice president become unable to serve Bill Clinton would become president - an ascension some scholars believe would be in violation of the spirit of the Constitution 's 22nd Amendment prohibition on president's serving a third term. \nThe relevant section of the 22nd Amendment relating to presidential term limits reads: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of President more than once.\" \nBill Clinton is on record as saying he believes presidents should not be limited to two terms in the White House . \"Look at President Reagan , who was 70 years old when he became president. John McCain was older than that when he ran for president. People are living longer, they're developing greater capacity, so I've always thought that should be the rule.\" What Hillary Clinton Would Do With Bill Clinton \nMrs. Clinton said during her first run for president in 2008 that she would deploy her husband across the globe as a sort of \"roving ambassador.\" \"When I become president, Bill Clinton, my dear husband, will be one of the people who will be sent around the world as a roving ambassador to make it very clear to the rest of the world that we're back to a policy of reaching out and working and trying to make friends and allies and stopping the alienation of the rest of the world. There's not a problem we face, from global terrorism to global warming or HIV-AIDS or bird flu or tuberculosis, where we don't need friends and allies.\" \nMany political observer's have described a Hillary presidency as being \"Bill Clinton's third term.\" Some pundits have warned that thrusting Bill Clinton into the spotlight again could undermine the first female president. \nEveryone remembers, of course, Bill Clinton's troubled second term . His affair with White House staffer Monica Lewinsky brought him closer to an impeachment conviction than any president since Andrew Johnson . \nBill Clinton has said he'd be willing to sit in on cabinet meetings if asked, serving as a sort of benign elder statesman. He added, however: \"I think itâ€™s better for me to give her my advice privately most of the time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:06:00.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
