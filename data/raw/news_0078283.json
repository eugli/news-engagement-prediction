The season kicks off with the organization’s flagship band, the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, led by its artistic director, Wynton Marsalis. The opening Sept. 14 program at Rose Theater, “The Fantastic Mr. Jelly Lord,” will pay homage to Jelly Roll Morton, a titan of Mr. Marsalis’ hometown, New Orleans. The following night, a very different American legend will be celebrated: Walt Whitman. The vocalists Kate McGarry and Kurt Elling will perform Fred Hersch’s composition “Leaves of Grass,” which sets Whitman’s words to music. On Sept. 22-24, the Pulitzer Prize winner Henry Threadgill will perform in various group iterations, and premiere a new work. The Orchestra will present a brand new Songbook series at the Rose Theater on Oct. 20-21, but much of its season consists of tributes: to Leonard Bernstein (Nov. 9-11); Benny Goodman (Jan. 11-13); Thelonious Monk (April 5-7, with Chick Corea); and Ornette Coleman (May 18-19). The more intimate Appel Room, meanwhile, will host performances by Marilyn Maye (Oct. 27-28); Eliane Elias (Nov. 3-4); and Michael Feinstein (May 2-3, 30-31). Mr. Akinmusire, a trumpeter, will make his Jazz at Lincoln Center debut in Dave Douglas’s “Dizzy Atmosphere” concert, honoring Dizzy Gillespie on Feb. 23-24. And Mr. Alexander, the 14-year-old whiz-kid pianist, will perform as part of a showcase March 2-3. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T20:01:45.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
