Buzz has it that the couple, who had been dating for a year, has parted ways. It was only last year that the news of Kalki dating Neerja actor came out. \nBut within a few months, the rumours of their relationship hitting a rocky patch started doing the rounds. In last October, the two snubbed each other at the premiere of A Death in the Gunj at the Mumbai Film Festival, and this sparked rumours of a break-up. \nHowever, the lovebirds shut their detractors in December when they posed pictures on Instagram. But it seems the relationship went downhill after that. A post shared by Jim Sarbh (@jimsarbhforreal) on Dec 8, 2016 at 2:16am PST \nAccording to a report in Spotboye.com , the couple decided to part ways last week. \nA source was quoted as telling the website, \"Kalki and Jim had a tiff then and were determined to work on their relationship, but things didn't work out and they actually decided to call it off last week.\" \nJim and Kalki, who are popular theatre personalities, met during a play, The Living Room. And the two hit it off well. And soon the rumours of them dating started doing the rounds. But that seems to be in the past now and the two have decided to move on.
