That compared to 10,000 who moved to the United States, and 3,000 who moved to the UK.

Around 30pc of millionaires are business owners, employing large numbers of people, according to the report, while they also pay large amounts of income tax. \nNew World Wealth’s study, its fourth annual report, added that very few millionaires - defined in the study as individuals who have net assets of $1m or more - have left the UK since the vote to leave the European Union, while there continues to be a flow of millionaires into Britain. \n“Going forward, we expect HNWI [high net worth individuals] migration into the UK to continue, despite Brexit,” it said. “In particular we expect large HNWI inflows from France, China, India, the Middle East and Africa into the UK. However, on the flip side, we do expect some UK HNWIs to move to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US over the next 10 years.” Follow Telegraph Business", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:38:44.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
