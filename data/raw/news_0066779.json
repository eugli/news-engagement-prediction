The third and most recent attempt has been operational since about 9 .a.m. Thursday. Animal Adventure Park owner Jordan Patch claims millions have been tuning in to YouTube to watch April give birth to her latest child. (Animal Adventure Park/Facebook) \n\"Instead of sitting behind a keyboard or holding up protest sign, get behind conservation,\" said Patch, who held some produce for some reason while delivering his Facebook Live message. \"We're all on the same team. We want the best for these animals, and we would love to have them in their natural environment one day, but until we can control the destruction of natural habitat and poaching, that is not going to happen.\" \nIt's unclear why the park thinks activists in particular were responsible since, according to Google, \"Flagging videos is anonymous, so other users can't tell who flagged a video.\" \nPatch also confirmed April is in no pain while adding they have no specific idea when it will give birth.
