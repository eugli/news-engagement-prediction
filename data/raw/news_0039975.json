We will find out on Monday. \nThe IPL season is still more than two months away, and it could be a good place to regain some confidence away from the spotlight in Australia — although his record in India (with 20 runs at 6.66 from just three IPL performances) may be the bigger deterrent. Brad Haddin is in form and chasing a big IPL deal. Source: AAP \nHADDIN HUNTING FOR A PAY DAY \nThere were more than a few raised eyebrows and a chuckles in Mumbai when Brad Haddin set his reserve price at nearly $300k — the second-highest band. \nHonestly, you could almost hear the sniggers all the way from Sydney. \nAnd yes, the former Test wicketkeeper is 39 years old. \nBut is it that outrageous for a team to have a look in his direction? \nHaddin is still one of the cleanest strikers of a ball there is — his straight drive remains one of the most aesthetically pleasing in world cricket — and he’s certainly capable of producing a matchwinning innings. \nYou need look no further than his outstanding 73 off 39 balls in the opening match of the Pakistan Super League, when he smoked three sixes and eight fours to propel Islamabad to victory a week ago. \nWith experience on the subcontinent, and a strike rate that typically hovers at the impressive 140 mark, Haddin has proven he not finished yet by any means. Pat Cummins and Mitchell Johnson (foreground) have set the highest reserve prices. Source: News Corp Australia \nFEARSOME FAST BOWLERS \nThe two biggest Australian names to throw their hats into the ring are lightning fast quicks Mitchell Johnson and Pat Cummins. \nBoth have a bit to prove, but even with a reserve price of $389,000 it’s fair to say there’ll be a bit of interest. \nJohnson was cut by the Kings XI Punjab after a disappointing season which left some wondering whether his cricket career was wrapping up. \nBut the Ashes hero looked a million bucks again after a rejuvenating Big Bash League, where he pulled out some extraordinary performances to spearhead Perth Scorchers to a record third title. \nThat 3-3 which demolished the Melbourne Stars? That probably turned a few heads and had most franchises moving pieces around trying to make room. \nCummins on the other hand has barely had a taste of the IPL as injuries have kept him sidelined most of the time but — touch wood — he looks healthy and is back bowling fire. \nThrow in the vastly improved batting which he displayed at times for the Thunder this year, and Cummins becomes a valuable piece for teams that want to bowl heat and bat deep. Ben McDermott produced one of the knocks of the BBL. Source: AAP \nTHE BARGAINS \nOK, not everyone can earn the mega bucks of Shane Watson, Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni. \nBut there’s bargains to be had amongst the Australian offerings — particularly in the form of the game’s rising stars. \nRising T20 specialist Chris Green — currently plying his trade in the PSL for the Lahore Qalandars — and fellow young all-rounder Ashton Turner are both listed at the second-lowest reserve price of $39,000. \nWant cheaper? No worries. \nBen McDermott became an overnight sensation in the Big Bash when he blazed an extraordinary century for Hobart to help reel in the biggest score in BBL history against Melbourne Renegades. \nHis ridiculous 114 off 52 balls set up the last-ball win as the Hurricanes notched 8-223 — if anyone in India was watching, he should get a nibble because at the lowest reserve of $19,000 they won’t come cheaper. \nHurricanes teammate D’Arcy Short, also listed at the lowest base price, is a punishing top-order batsman and a more than-handy left-arm spinner — as the late bloomer showed in Wednesday night’s PMs XI match where he went within a whisker of snaring a hat-trick. \nTHE FULL LIST OF AUSSIE HOPEFULS \n$389,000 reserve", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:24:17.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
