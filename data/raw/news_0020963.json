They excel in carrying out 'test marketing' with their ridiculous statements. \nThe moment the people react negatively, they would then change the 'offer' or position themselves differently. \nMushiro: This is a real example of 'endless possibilities'. But a sickening one. \nTengku Adnan can really go on and on to show the qualities of a minister from an Umno university. \nAnticonmen: Tengku Adnan, just focus on Kuala Lumpur. So many homeless people sleeping on sidewalks. Stinking drains. Insufficient parking places. Dirty eateries, backlanes. \nInsufficient food outlets. Illegal stalls. Unhygienic food preparation, rats, vandalism. Clogged drains. Broken tiles on sidewalks, and potholes everywhere. \nExplain 'Malays neglected in Penang' remark to police, Ramkarpal tells Ku Nan \nThana55: Tengku Adnan, why aren't the elected representatives in charge of the federal territory of Kuala Lumpur? \nThe current state of affairs is illegal with Putrajaya making decisions when there are elected reps for KL. It’s time to take FT back from Putrajaya and let the duly-elected reps run KL. \nDo not give the bulls**t that Malays are neglected. On the contrary, the opposition-run states do a better job in helping Malays compared to Umno-run states. \nGoldee: Penang Malays are neglected not due to Pakatan Harapan's doing. Penang Malays were left high and dry when the state was ruled by the previous government for 50 years. \nDespite two terms, Pakatan Harapan under DAP have done much more than Gerakan in elevating the status of Penang Malays. If Penang Malays were neglected, it was the fault of Umno/BN. \nAntiRacial: Tengku Adnan, you became laughing stock now. See what happens to your statement, which you did with the intention to please your master. \nYou tried to recapture Penang using the lowest-level dirty tricks. Your statement has backfired on BN government, the previous Gerakan government and yourself when the Penang government, developers and NGOs release facts to show how much Penang government under opposition have done for Penang people, especially for Penang Malays. \nNow you look very stupid in everyone’s eyes. You know you are not intelligent enough, so why not keep your mouth shut? \nGotcha: The Penang government should take necessary steps to sue him in court for defaming the administration. \nSimple Malaysian: Ku Nan's statements were meant as smokescreen to the ever-increasing pressure on the government to defend 1MDB and its many related scandals. \nAnonymous_1388029052: He is the MP of the smallest parliamentary seat in the country ( Putrajaya ) - with only a 15,000 electorate. If he's that great and popular, he should contest for a multiracial seat in KL. \nGuan Eng challenges Ku Nan to TV debate on 'Penang FT' \nFellowMalaysian: Penang CM Lim Guan Eng (LGE) has thrown down the gauntlet and has openly and irrevocably challenged Tengku Adnan to a debate on a serious topic which was mooted by Ku Nan's himself a couple of days ago. \nThe debate will provide an excellent ground for him to present his excellent idea of turning Penang into a federal territory and also to tell LGE right in his face why his proposal is such a wonderful idea. \nIf Ku Nan refused to accept to debate LGE by giving all kinds of excuses, then the rakyat will know that this 'fake' FT minister is not even prepared to defend himself. \nHow much then can we trust him if he failed to defend himself; his sincerity and dedication in his duty as the FT minister will be immediately called to question. \nCQ Muar: Tengku Adnan, if you have the balls, accept Guan Eng's open challenge. Don't shame your party Umno by declining or not responding to LGE's invitation. \nCome on, be a man and prove to us you're worthy of our support as a top leader in government. Otherwise stop making a fool of yourself. \nAnonymous_40f4: What, debate Tengku Adnan? He is a third-rate politician. He doesn’t know how to debate. He only can spread slander on TV3 against the opposition. \nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers. Only paying subscribers can post comments.
