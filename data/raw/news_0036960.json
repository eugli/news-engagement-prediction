Tests that pick up HIV antibodies in the blood require an even longer wait. This picture taken on December 7, 2016 shows a nurse extracting blood from an individual undergoing HIV testing at the LoveYourself Anglo Centre in Manila. (AFP) \nRNA tests can detect the virus directly after about 10 days, but are more expensive. \nEarly detection is crucial to stop an infected person unknowingly passing the virus on to other people through sex. \nAccording to the World Health Organization, there were about 36.7 million people living with HIV in 2015, mainly in low- and middle-income countries. \nAn estimated 2.1 million people were infected in 2015. \nSome 35 million people have died from HIV-related causes, including 1.1 million in 2015.
