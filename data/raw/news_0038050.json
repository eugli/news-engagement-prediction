Photo: supplied \n\"In one short period, there will be more workers added to the CBD than residents in the next few years. This is the first time the pendulum has swung back in 30 years.\" \nIn December, billionaire developer Lang Walker was given the green light to build two commercial towers, adding to the Walker Coporation's ambitious plans to build the tallest residential building in NSW, the Aspire tower, nearby. \nTwo of the office towers are already leased, with the National Australia Bank announcing in December it would occupy the entire tower at 3 Parramatta Square, which is expected to be completed by the Walker Corporation by 2020. \nThe NSW government has also committed to making Parramatta's \"dual CBD\" status a reality, announcing in December some 4000 public service jobs would be shifted the new office tower slated for 4 Parramatta Square. \nIt is the largest ever government agency leasing commitment in Western Sydney, and will see 1600 staff from the Department of Planning and Environment relocated directly from the Sydney CBD. \nMore than a million people are expected to more into Western Sydney in the next two decades, but at present about 200,000 people leave the area everyday to go to jobs outside the region. \nAs the concept of Parramatta as a core business centre takes shape, the opportunity to \"reverse the talent drain\" of the daily mass exodus to Sydney would drive further growth and allow western region to retain the economic benefits, Mr Borger said. \n\"What this means, is that people can get a job close to home. A good quality job.\" \nLast month, Western Sydney University welcomed the first cohort of business students to its new 14-level campus at Parramatta Square, the first building to be completed in the new precinct.
