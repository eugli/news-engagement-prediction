Trump has repeatedly called global warming a “hoax” perpetuated by China and denied climate change.

I can assure you there’s no wall in my program,” Marcon said. “Do you remember the Maginot Line?” \nMacron’s call might find some response within the US, as President Trump has seemingly started to change federal policy toward science and the environment. \nTrump’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Scott Pruitt, although does not share the US president’s view that the climate change is a “hoax,” believes that the human impact on it needs more debate and research. \nREAD MORE: Leave euro & vote Frexit: Le Pen unveils National Front manifesto \nBesides that, shortly after his inauguration, Trump banned at least three federal agencies from talking to the media, issuing grants or publishing scientific research.
