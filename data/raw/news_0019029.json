Impeachment & political scandals Yet, as the 12-month countdown begins, South Koreans have been distracted by other events. The country's Constitutional Court is deliberating a motion to impeach President Park Geun-hye over a corruption scandal which sparked weeks of protests in the capital Seoul. It is a far cry from the deafening cheers which greeted the 2011 announcement that the ski resort of PyeongChang, about 180km east of Seoul, would host the Winter Olympics.

Companies have reportedly been reluctant to sign up to sponsorship deals, leaving the organizing committee with a shortfall. The total cost for the Games is said to be just over $10 billion, a contrast to the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics which cost five times more. Lee Hee-beom, president of PyeongChang 2018, told reporters this week: \"Some part was affected by the political scandal, and some part by the situation of the economy.\" He said he's hoping the Games can help shake off the \"negative image\" that came from what he called \"a series of unsubstantiated rumors\" associated with the political scandal. \"Some even went as far as saying we should give up on hosting the Olympics,\" he said. \"But, fortunately, the prevailing opinion is that we should all try to restore our national pride with the Olympics. And we're concentrating only on holding a successful Olympics. \"I know that we are criticized for little public awareness of the 2018 Winter Olympics. I expect the one-year countdown event will add momentum to boost public awareness worldwide.\" JUST WATCHED Asia's new passion for winter sports Replay More Videos ...
