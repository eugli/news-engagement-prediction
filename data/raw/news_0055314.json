EBITDA margins will likely break support in the first half of 2017. \nCurrent portion of long-term debt is over $3B. SDRL does not have cash to cover near-term payments. \nEither SDRL will go belly up or the stock will get diluted in a restructuring. The end could be near. Seadrill (NYSE: SDRL ) reports quarterly earnings Thursday. Analysts expect revenue of $649.32 million and eps of $0.18. The revenue estimate implies a 13% decline sequentially. Investors should focus on the following key items. Declining Top Line Last quarter Seadrill's revenue declined 14% sequentially. If this quarter's revenue falls by double-digits again I would find it rather alarming. Management has cut costs to the bone in order to preserve margins. EBIDA margin last quarter was 59%, versus 64% in the previous quarter and 52% in the year earlier period. The company has also cut its head count by 23% from 7,100 to 5,500. At some point Seadrill could cut into muscle. Secondly, if revenue keeps falling it could lose scale and margins could suffer further. At the end of the day the company will likely face more headwinds. The market for offshore contractors remains oversupplied. Industry participants have been characterized by a decline in average daily revenue and revenue earning days. The recent bounce in oil prices might not help long-term. First of all, prices sub-$60 will not likely spur additional investment in offshore. Secondly, if oil prices continue to rise then shale oil plays will be able to make more money, and will increase supply. The increase in supply could tamp down prices -- it's all a circular reference. Lack Of liquidity Experts predict the offshore market will not rebound until 2018 or 2019. Seadrill might not have that long. First of all, it lacks liquidity. Q3 working capital of -$3.0 billion was down from -$1.3 billion in Q2. Current portion of long-term debt is now $3.1 billion; with cash of only $1.3 billion the company lacks the liquidity to make the payment. If the company does not secure a $1 billion lifeline to help restructure its debt, it could go belly-up. However, more equity could be throwing good money after bad. Seadrill's revenue will likely continue to decline as contracts dry up. I do not expect oil prices to rise above $60 any time soon. In fact, prices could fall if the OPEC supply cuts do not stick. If investors help restructure Seadrill's debt then existing shareholders face serious dilution. If not, then the company could go belly up. In either scenario investors should avoid SDRL. If the company finally went belly up it could potentially reduce the supply of offshore rigs, and help pricing. In that scenario I would consider investing in other industry participants. For now SDRL is a sell. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
