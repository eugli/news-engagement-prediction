We got married two weeks ago.” \nThe furious mum-of-two shopped her husband to the police and he has been hauled before a judge for bigamy. \nCaroline told the Mirror: “He’s a lying, cheating conman. I can’t believe he had the brass neck to marry someone else.” \nHardy admitted bigamy when he appeared before magistrates in Walsall between Christmas and New Year. \nThe landscaping firm manager was given a six-month suspended sentence at Wolverhampton Crown Court .

He moved in that day. Michael thought of himself as my saviour because I’d been through abuse previously. \n“He was like a bodyguard and made me feel safe, but looking back on it he was already taking control. \n“I didn’t realise it at the time because I was falling madly in love with him. I think he just wanted a home. He quickly proposed and I accepted. Everything was fine, everything was good.” \nThe happy couple got married in front of dozens of friends and family at Romsey Town Hall in 2014. \n“The wedding day was beautiful,” sobbed Caroline. “I felt like the luckiest woman in the world.” \nIn his speech, Hardy beamed: “I can’t think of anyone better to spend the rest of my life with than Caroline. She’s everything to me.” Michael leaving Wolverhapton Court (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nThe couple moved to Walsall, West Mids, with Caroline’s daughter Charlotte last June after he got a promotion. \n“I didn’t want to move but also didn’t want to stand in his way, so we moved up to Walsall in June,” she said. \n“Everything was fine initially. He was enjoying the work and I was settling into the area. \n“But one night in October he said he was going to help salt the car park of a bingo place in Birmingham and didn’t come home.” \nIncredibly Hardy rang Caroline and claimed he had been injured at work and was being treated in a psychiatric hospital for a breakdown. \n“I didn’t have a clue what was going on but believed what he was telling me,” she said. \n“I know it sounds crazy. He said he’d suffered a breakdown and needed to stay in hospital. \n“He would come and see me three times a week and we’d sleep together, but he always said he had to go back to hospital at night. \n“Looking back on it, I was an idiot. He was clearly with his other woman but I just believed what he said.” \nWolverhampton Crown Court heard that unbeknown to Caroline, Hardy had met Joanne via an online dating website in August. Caroline Lacey was Michael's first wife (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nClaiming to be a fireman, he told her he was a widower and chillingly said Caroline had died from cervical cancer a year earlier. \nProsecutor Edward Soulsby said Joanne fell for Hardy and his lies and accepted his proposal five weeks before Christmas. \nThey tied the knot in a religious service at a registry office in Birmingham in front of 45 guests on December 10 last year. \nMeanwhile Caroline and her daughter began to suspect Hardy was not telling the truth. \nShe said: “I remembered the same address used to always appear on his sat-nav. Every time he got it out he’d type the same road in. \n“Also sometimes he rang me from the van and I’d hear the sat-nav reading out the address. \n“I said to Charlotte that we needed to find out if something is going on.” \nThe pair walked the ten miles to the address in Weoley Castle, Birmingham, on December 19 and incredibly spotted Hardy’s van parked outside a house. \n“Charlotte saw it first and then realised he was sitting in it with a blonde woman in the passenger seat,” she said. \n“I couldn’t believe it. We ran over and he tried to keep us away from her. He tried to push us down the road. Caroline Lacey showing her 007 Michael tattoo (Photo: Daily Mirror) \n“I said, ‘What’s going on? What’s with this blonde bit?’ At that point she climbed out of the van. \n“I said, ‘I’m his wife’ and she said, ‘No, I’m his wife. We got married two weeks ago’. I said, ‘That’s funny, because we’ve been married for two years’. He just stood there with his head down. \n“She went mad and he was trying to calm her down. He even begged me to tell her I was his sister. He was all over the place. \n“I went home and cried myself to sleep, then decided to report him to the police the next day.” \nHardy was arrested by officers from West Midlands Police on December 28 and admitted bigamy in court the following day. \nAs well as the suspended jail term, he has also been ordered to complete 120 hours community service. \nHe must also pay prosecution costs of £340 and complete a 20-day rehabilitation programme. \nHardy’s lawyer Claire Evans described his actions as a “farce” and said he was “extremely remorseful”. \nThe court heard Joanne is standing by him and “thinks she can make a good man out of him”.

I thought I was going to be with him for the rest of my life. \n“He was the man for me from the moment we set eyes on each other. Now I’ve got nothing. I love him with all my heart and still do, but I know I can’t go back to him after what he’s done. \n“I feel physically crushed. If it wasn’t for Charlotte I don’t think I’d be here today. For someone you love to do this breaks your heart. There was no inkling that he was cheating on me.” \nCharlotte, a carer, added: “He was like a dad to me. I don’t think I’ll ever understand why he did what he did.” \nHardy’s other ‘wife’ Joanne refused to comment when contacted by the Daily Mirror. \nHardy said outside court: “I’m truly sorry. In hindsight I should have really worked at it with Caroline.” What is bigamy \nBigamy is defined as the act of entering into marriage with a person when already legally married to another. \nThe second marriage is deemed illegal and invalid as long as the first spouse is alive and a divorce has not been finalised. \nBigamy has been an offence in England and Wales since the 19th century. \nThe crime falls under section 57 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. \nA person found guilty of bigamy can be jailed for seven years or fined, or both. Exceptions may be made where someone has not heard from their partner for seven years and is unsure if they are alive. \nIn some cases, allowances can also be made if someone genuinely believes their marriage has been dissolved. \nPeople who have legally married multiple partners in other countries will not be charged with bigamy in the UK unless they marry again in this country.
