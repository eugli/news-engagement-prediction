(Photo: Free Press news service photos) Buy Photo CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWe're sure Detroit sports fans everywhere have spent some time reminiscing about their favorite Detroit Tigers and Detroit Red Wings memories over the past few decades following news breaking of the death of Mike Ilitch on Friday. \nHere's a heartwarming story you may have missed about the team owner and pizza magnate: Ilitch once paid for civil rights activist Rosa Parks' rent from 1994 until her death in October 2005. \nParks, considered \"the first lady of civil rights,\" had moved to Detroit in 1957 following her famous resistance to racial segregation in 1955. \nAs reported by Christopher Botta of Sports Business Journal in 2014: \nOn Aug. 31, 1994, Parks, then 81, was robbed and assaulted in her home in central Detroit. (Judge Damon) Keith called real estate developer Alfred Taubman, the owner of Riverfront Apartments, about finding a safer home for Parks. Taubman pledged to find the best home available. \nWhen Ilitch read about Keith’s plan and Taubman’s promise in the newspaper, he called the judge and said he would pay for Parks’ housing for as long as necessary. (Parks passed away in 2005 at the age of 92). Keith served as the executor of the trust established for Parks’ housing. Remembering Mike Ilitch Chris Ilitch now in charge of dad's empire under succession plan \nThe story also shows a picture of Keith with a copy of a $2,000 check that Ilitch's Little Caesars Enterprises made toward Riverfront Apartments on Nov. 1, 1994. \n“It’s important that people know what Mr. Mike Ilitch did for Ms. Rosa Parks because it’s symbolic of what he has always done for the people of our city,\" Keith told the Sports Business Journal in 2014. \nIndeed, it's another example of the kind of impact Ilitch made on the city of Detroit and its people throughout his life. \nIlitch passed away Friday at 87 years old , according to his company, Ilitch Holdings, and his family will honor him in a private funeral service. \nDo you have a story to share about Ilitch?
