According to the folks at Canard PC, Intel is said to be introducing two brand new high-end Kaby Lake-based processors that are intended to prevent AMD from dominating the enthusiast CPU market. These are the Intel Core i7-7740K and Core i5-7640K. \nIntel’s supposed response to the AMD’s lower end Ryzen processor is the Core i5-7640K. According to several sources, Intel’s upcoming Core i5 processor will essentially be a faster Core i5-7600K. It’ll boast 4.0GHz of base frequency speed, which is 200MHz faster compared to the Core i5-7600K. One rather interesting alleged feature of the Core i5-7640K is that it may be equipped with SMT (Simultaneous multithreading) – something that’s not often found on Intel’s i5 processors. \nMeanwhile, AMD’s more powerful high-end Ryzen processor, supposedly called the R7 1800X, will face competition from Intel’s new Core i7-7740K processor. Canard PC mentioned that Intel’s upcoming Core i7 processor may ship with a base clock speed of 4.3GHz out of the box, which makes it faster than the current Core i7-7700K by 100MHz. Besides that, the TDP of said CPU will also be increased to more than 100W (i7-7700K has 91W TDP). Rumour: Intel Looking To License Radeon GPU Tech For Its Processors \nUnfortunately, Canard PC made no mention of when Intel plans to release both the Core i5-7640K and Core i7-7740K processors to the market. Those aside, I’d like to advise our dear readers to take this one with a good serving of doubt, because this rumour only came from one source. Regardless, it seems like 2017 is shaping up to be a year to look forward to – especially for PC gamers and enthusiasts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:30:41.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
