Who’s open, who’s closed, which chef has gone where and who pinched whose sommelier. Who’s run away to the mainland; who’s fled the mainland for a quieter life. The dearth of staff. The usual stuff. \nAnd any chat about Hobart’s food scene will inevitably lead to Fico, new kid on the Macquarie Street block. The story so far: young chef Oskar Rossi, son of noted Hobart artist Tom Samek, returns from world travels, including a stint at Vue de Monde in Melbourne, with a beau on his arm, young Naples-born chef Federica Andrisani. They do pop-up events, which work well. They do a light, mature, modern take on Italian-inspired food. \nEveryone says: you should open a real restaurant. They say: let’s do it. \nFico is not much to look at, a small-budget makeover, although undoubtedly prettier than the newsagency that preceded it. It is old, spacious, with tables generously set around two adjoining rooms and a nondescript colour scheme lifted with OK furniture and a few quirky murals. A kind of eating bar/desk/waiters’ station is the only concession to modern, post-table eating. \nBut there’s a different warmth at Fico and it comes from well trained, unpretentious staff with an infectious pride in the kitchen’s product. You want to like Fico straight off, and the food doesn’t diminish the emotion. Youth, Italy and Tassie produce inform the dishes, but there’s no Tricolore jingoism. Plump for the set menu – $65; excellent value – and you’ll see fresh thinking, a tightly reined-in collection of flavours/elements, and time-consuming technique. It’s what you go out for. \nDishes such as the morsel of savoury brioche, like a baked doughnut, with a centre of smoked eel, a garnish of salty small roe and seaweed flakes: a riverfish heading for the sea. And cubes of perfect, firm, soy-cured kingfish with a slippery, gossamer sheath of bronze soy gel and a skullcap of wasabi creme fraiche. No, not Italian, but very impressive. \nThe finger of scored and crisp-grilled mackerel goes closer to the Continent, with tomato essence and olive oil in the dish, beautiful poached mini tomatoes, nasturtium, chive flower and green chilli, all foils to the fish’s inherent oiliness. Italia builds momentum. Along comes a lovely, super fresh zucchini flower stuffed with a smooth, house-made ricotta cream; it sits in a puddle of pure, vibrant tomato sauce with olive oil and basil. I didn’t think about extra seasoning all night. Roasted pigeon with beetroot jus. Picture: Matthew Newton \nThen a super-confident nest of firm, taupe-coloured tagliolini that relies on little other than an agrodolce roasted onion poaching broth, oil and parmesan for its success. I loved its power, austerity. \nAnd half an expertly roasted pigeon (pictured) – dark, glossy-skinned yet pink-breasted – is plated with equal austerity with a simply brilliant beetroot jus. \nI like that the tasting menu dishes differ from the carte. I like the sense of spontaneity a chef-driven restaurant can execute. And so we go off piste with a round of amaranth and yoghurt “pudding” topped with poached fig, fig leaf sorbet and a kind of baked milk cracker to crown it all. Liked the idea, but the fig itself was a little, er, subtle. Small beer. \nFico has energy and talent, in that gentle, modest Tassie manner. There’s pride of place and optimism on the plate. And we’ll hear more from Rossi/Andrisani, I suspect. It’s what people are saying over coffee. \nADDRESS: 151 Macquarie Street, Hobart | CONTACT: 03 6245 3391; ficofico.net | HOURS: Lunch Wed-Sat; dinner Tue-Sat | TYPICAL PRICES: Starters $15; mains $28; dessert $12; set menu $65 | LIKE THIS? TRY… Il Lido, Perth; The French Saloon, Melbourne | SUMMARY: Italian, inspired | RATING: 3 1/2 stars wine Cathy and Neil Howard cumulatively took more than 40 years to establish Whicher Ridge wines. \nWINE: JAMES HALLIDAY \nThe paths followed by would-be vignerons are many and various. The common thread is the discovery that planting the first vines takes longer than anticipated; it’s even slower for the first glass to arrive on the table. I’m not talking about virtual wineries, where the grapes are purchased and the wines contract-made. With good advice, that might take six months. \nCathy and Neil Howard cumulatively took more than 40 years to establish Whicher Ridge – or, on the shortest view, a mere six years. Each had worked for 20 years or more as a viticulturist (Neil) and winemaker (Cathy). \nNeil set foot on the soil of the Pyrenees in the mid-1980s, working for Taltarni, Blue Pyrenees Estate and later Mount Avoca for 12 years before moving to Margaret River in 1998, initially managing Sandalford’s vineyard and then developing and managing several smaller vineyards in the region. \nCathy left Tasmania in 1995 after working for Pipers Brook Vineyard, and over the next seven years was a winemaker for Orlando and St Hallett. In 2002 she moved to Margaret River to become chief winemaker for Watershed before managing a large contract winemaking business. \nThe planning and development of Whicher Ridge in Geographe began in 2003, the 10,000 vines in the 5ha vineyard planted by hand. The first release of sauvignon blanc was in 2008, cabernet sauvignon first released in 2010. They supplement the estate plantings by purchasing chardonnay from Margaret River, and riesling and shiraz from Frankland River. The cellar door is manned by Cathy, the vineyard and farm by Neil. \nAs well as presenting the wines, Cathy guides visitors through the adjacent wine sensory garden. For each grape variety there are flowers, fruit trees, herbs and vegetables used to describe the aromas and flavours found in the matching varietal wine.

A striking wine, its complexity on the bouquet matched by the raw power and drive of the palate. The wine is built around a scaffold of minerally/chalky acidity, the composition of fruit flavours of less importance than the structure and texture. 12.8% alc, screwcap. 95 points, drink to 2020, $26 \n2013 WHICHER RIDGE FRANKLAND RIVER SHIRAZ Medium-bodied, with deceptive power, length and fragrance. Distinctly savoury, but intense blue and black fruits emerge on the finish and aftertaste. Complex techniques include draining some actively fermenting juice into new oak, the remainder into tank, the next day returning the juice from tank and barrels to the fermenter. 13.5% alc, screwcap. 95 points, drink to 2035, $34 \n2013 WHICHER RIDGE ELEVATION GEOGRAPHE CABERNET SAUVIGNON Deep crimson-purple; a distinguished cabernet. The bouquet is a complex amalgam of blackcurrant fruit, quality French oak and earthy tannins. The vinification parallels the shiraz, except for the oak (American for the shiraz). 13.5% alc, screwcap. 96 points, drink to 2038, $39 epicurean Phony CVs hurt restaurants It’s hard to believe someone would risk the reputation of their business for the sake of something as simple as a CV check. \nEPICUREAN: JOHN LETHLEAN \nI had a strange conversation with a restaurant owner a couple of years ago. This fellow had employed, via an agency, a head chef who had quite a CV. The PR machine went into overdrive and this no-name backwater restaurant suddenly had a nationally known name attached to it. Of course, the employer had done zero due diligence on his new “star”. He had simply outsourced the recruitment and swallowed the hype like a chilled, freshly opened oyster. Of course, it all went to poo. \nIt’s difficult to believe someone would risk the reputation of their business for the sake of something as simple as a résumé check. In the cooking world, there are different kinds of failures. Such as the failure to present work experience honestly to prospective employers, the media or other stakeholders. The bullshit CV. \n“I remember a Japanese guy who was persistent about staging with us,” recalls Martin Benn, chef-proprietor of Sydney’s Sepia restaurant. “Staging” is the widely deployed international system of work experience in restaurant kitchens – a culinary internship, if you like, with far less rigour around parameters such as length of service, duties or access to the talent. \n“I don’t necessarily agree with the staging system,” says Benn, “but in this instance, we finally said yes. He came in, did a day, and we never saw him again. Made up all these reasons why he couldn’t come back. Lo and behold, a few months later he turns up as a chef in a Sydney Japanese restaurant and Sepia is on his résumé! \n“It happens all the time,” Benn adds, “and we’ve been burned. Staging is a dangerous game. I get a lot of CVs. Some of these people have ‘worked’ at more places in two years than I have in my entire life. Don’t get me wrong; Noma is a great place to train but a lot of the time these guys who staged there just picked herbs.” \nBen Shewry, another elite Australian chef, feels the same way. “It’s happened multiple times,” says the proprietor of Attica in Melbourne. “I’ll get a phone call from someone, and it’ll be like, ‘Bob says he was with you for two years’, but I can’t even remember him.” \nIt surprises me that this sort of thing still goes on, because modern connectivity makes due diligence so much easier. As Shewry says, “It’s a small world, but pretty far reaching”. \nIt used to be more opaque. A chef would get off the boat from a stint in the Old Country telling us he’d been working for Marco Pierre White, or the Roux brothers, or Gordon Ramsay when he was actually a restaurant chef, not a TV star. The prospective employers would see the spin value, and didn’t we in the media lap it up. But I do recall emailing Ramsay’s organisation about 12 years ago seeking clarity on a certain chef’s claims and – finally – getting a response that went something like: “Never heard of him.” \nWe in the media have to share responsibility here; we need to quantify, to justify. That work experience thing is a fundamental bona fide when you’re trying to justify a story’s worth. But next time you read something like “Former Noma chef opens yadayadayada”, switch on your bullshit detector and ask yourself how many stagers have been through that Copenhagen kitchen in the past 10 years. It may just be a new restaurant with outstanding picked herbs. \nWant to leave a comment? Scroll to the bottom and share your thoughts.
