Credit: AP;PA \nBritish artists swept up many of the big awards at the 2017 Grammy Awards on Sunday. \nDavid Bowie was awarded four posthumous gongs for his album Blackstar. \nThe critically acclaimed album was released last year on the popstar's birthday in January, just two days before he died after a secret battle with cancer. \nBowie was awarded best rock performance, best alternative music album, best recording package, and best engineered album, non-classical. \nHis son took to Twitter to say how \"proud\" he was of his father. Favourite \nSinger Adele also did well out of the awards, leaving with the top five. \nShe was awarded for best album of the year for 25, and best song and record of the year with Hello. \nAdditionally, she walked away with best pop solo performance and best pop vocal album. \nReceiving best album of the year, Adele told the audience in tears \"I can't possibly accept this\". \nAdele paid tribute to Beyoncé, whose album Lemonade was also nominated for the award, saying that she is the \"artist of my life\". \nChoking back tears, she said: \"I'm very humbled and I’m very grateful and gracious, but my artist of my life is Beyoncé and this album to me, the Lemonade album, was just so monumental.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:10:14.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
