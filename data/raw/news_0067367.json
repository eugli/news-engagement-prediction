After this, the region got a momentum in terms of development,” he told the gathering. \n“And now Prime Minister Narendra Modi had rechristened the ‘Look East Policy’ as ‘Act East Policy’ to fast track development in the region after years of negligence,” he said. \nThe home minister said the Centre was keen on development of Arunachal Pradesh which is “strategically located, sharing international borders with China, Bhutan and Myanmar,” and assured full support to the state for its all round development. \nReferring to the border dispute between India and China, Singh said the relations between the Asian giants has improved and they were involved in bilateral trade worth $ 70 billion. \nSingh, who was accompanied by minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju and BJP national secretary Ram Madhab, said, “Arunachal Pradesh is in its full youthfulness and interestingly the chief minister is also the youngest in the country. He has the vision and will power to lead the state to the zenith of development.” \n“I am confident that under Pema Khandu, Arunachal Pradesh will shine among developed states of the country,” he said. \nBJP had formed the government in Arunachal Pradesh last year after 33, out of 43 Peoples Party of Arunachal (PPA) MLAs led by chief minister Pema Khandu, joined the party. \nThe Union minister also declared open a four-day Festival of Arunachal and released a souvenir on the occasion. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:13:36.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
