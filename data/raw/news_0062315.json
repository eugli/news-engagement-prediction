(The Press Tour/Instagram) \nEmma Watson is at it again. Unlike her campaign for women rights in underdeveloped countries, this time she is promoting sustainable fashion on social media. \nThe Hollywood star has teamed up with her stylist Rebecca Corbin-Murray to launch a new Instagram account, titled The Press Tour. \nThe account will track the actor on her press tour for the upcoming Disney movie Beauty and the Beast, offering a glimpse into her life on the road and her sustainable fashion choices along the way. Introducing the new handle on her current Instagram account on Monday, Watson said: “I hope you enjoy seeing what goes on behind the scenes. It takes a village!” A post shared by Emma Watson (@emmawatson) on Feb 19, 2017 at 8:05am PST \nWith just five posts as yet, the account has already amassed over 3,03,000 followers. The first photo posted showed the actor in a black-and-white checked Stella McCartney coat, with a caption referring to the brand as “the world’s first luxury brand that is committed to producing products that do not use leather, skins, feathers or fur.” She teamed the piece with a jumper from sustainable label Filippa K and shoes from the vegan brand Good Guys Don’t wear Leather.

The third, from Louis Vuitton, shows the star wearing a navy and blue dress made from Newlife recycled polyester, created from used plastic bottles. A post shared by The Press Tour (@the_press_tour) on Feb 20, 2017 at 2:16pm PST \nThis is not Watson’s first attempt at steering the fashion conversation towards sustainable choices — in 2010, she collaborated with the fairtrade fashion brand People Tree on several ethical clothing collections, also creating a sustainable capsule collection with Italian designer Alberta Ferretti one year later. \nSo now you know that you need not kill animals or destroy the environment in the name of fashion. Try making sustainable choices, for a better and more inclusive world. \nHere is some more of Emma Watson from her new sustainable campaign. Since beautiful has been done to death, why not try mindful this time.
