(credit: Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty Images) \nWASHINGTON (CBS News/CBSNewYork) – President Donald Trump is giving himself a mixed review thus far. \nIn an interview with Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” Tuesday morning, Trump said he would give himself an “A plus” for effort but only a “C or a C plus” for messaging. \n“Because I think I’ve done great things, but I don’t think I have — I and my people, I don’t think we’ve explained it well enough to the American public,” Trump said. “I think I get an A in terms of what I’ve actually done, but in terms of messaging, I’d give myself a C or a C plus.” \nTrump said he thought tonight’s joint address to Congress might give him an opportunity to improve his messaging grade. \nA recent CBS News poll taken one month into his term found that Trump had a 39 percent approval rating and 51 percent disapproval rating. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T22:39:21.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
