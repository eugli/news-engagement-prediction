If traffic is light, you can zip over to San Francisco in your car in less than 20 minutes. \n\"Bushrod isn't a well-known neighborhood name yet, but it obviously soon will be,\" Redfin agent Tom Hendershot said in a statement. \"Homebuyers come to the area hoping to find something in Rockridge and realize they can have an even better lifestyle at a lower cost in Bushrod. This may not last for long though — one two-bedroom starter home in this neighborhood recently sold for $200,000 over the list price and was off the market in 10 days.\" \nZillow currently had 17 properties listed in Bushrod on Jan. 31, from a basic one-bedroom, one-bath cottage for $599,000 to a Spanish-style three-bedroom fo r $850,000 . \nThe sales history of a three-bedroom on Dover St. is a sign of how the neighborhood is changing. The property sold for $150,000 in 1996 and then $480,000 in 2014. After undergoing a remodel, it sold only months later for $779,000. It's now on the market for $849,000. \nRELATED VIDEO: Oakland's real estate market is heating up \nEmerging trends show that Oakland's home real estate prices are soaring. Leigh Martinez reports. Media: KTVU \nWoodridge, an enclave in Bellevue, Wash., with high ranked schools and convenient location near the Microsoft headquarters, was No. 2 on the list. Serra, a neighborhood in Sunnyvale, Calif., ranked No 3. as it gains in popularity as buyers looking to live in the Silicon Valley get pushed out of pricier Palo Alto and Los Altos. (See the full list in the gallery above.) \nThe common theme among all the neighborhoods in the top 10 is that they're all near high-growth job centers, especially areas with tech jobs. They're notlocated within the city centers where prices are highest, but on the fringes where prices are lower and commutes still relatively reasonable.
