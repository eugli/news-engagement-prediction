An official said railways would generate a surplus of Rs 10,000 crore which could be invested in other modernisation programmes. Stations are being awarded to private developers under the so-called Swiss challenge method, which involves inviting a proposal and allowing rival bidders to better that proposal. As per the financial model, the government will not incur any expenditure as the private developer will rebuild the stations and maintain it for 15 years. Private players will be granted 45 years' leasing rights for commercial properties such as malls, hotels and hospitals developed at stations.
