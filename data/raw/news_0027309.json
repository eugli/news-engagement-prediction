(Joshua Roberts/REUTERS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Monday, February 13, 2017, 7:55 PM \nWASHINGTON — The Senate voted to confirm Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary on Monday after a bruising battle over Mnuchin’s past as a Wall Street executive. \nThe vote moves Trump’s top campaign fundraiser into a senior administration role, giving Mnuchin major sway over tax reform, financial regulation and economic diplomacy. It also puts a former Goldman Sachs executive who owned another company that foreclosed on tens of thousands of homes in charge of regulating the banks he once worked for. \nThe Senate voted 53-47 to confirm Mnuchin, with every Republican voting for him and all Democrats but Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) voting to oppose him — the latest close party-line vote on a Trump cabinet nominee. \nDemocrats fought hard against Mnuchin’s nomination, dubbing him the “foreclosure king” and blasting away at his record at OneWest, a real estate bank he helped purchase during the 2008 financial collapse. \nThe company foreclosed on as many as 60,000 homes, most of them in the southwest, and there is evidence that OneWest was less forgiving in helping people who were struggling to make mortgage payments remain in their homes than other companies. Mnuchin and his partners sold it for a hefty profit. \nMnuchin faced a tough grilling in committee over his past work, and Democrats went so far as to boycott the committee vote that moved Mnuchin’s nomination to the full Senate. \nDuring those hearings, he expressed irritation at the way Democrats portrayed his business career. \n“I have been maligned as taking advantage of others’ hardships in order to earn a buck,” he said, arguing he and OneWest had worked hard to help people keep their homes. “Nothing could be further from the truth.” \nDemocrats used Mnuchin’s confirmation to hammer Trump as a hypocrite after promising to clean up Wall Street. \n“Over the course of the 2016 campaign we heard from candidate trump time and time again that he’d be tough on Wall Street,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday evening. “President Trump told Steve Mnuchin, a hedge fund manager and a Wall Street insider with decades of experience in the boardroom, ‘you’re hired as my treasury secretary.’ that is a broken promise.” \n“The muck in President Trump’s swamp just got neck-deep,” The Democratic National Committee said in a statement. “When millions of American families were losing their jobs, homes, savings, pensions and hope, Steven Mnuchin was making a fortune off their misery.” \nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted shortly before the vote that Trump “Talked a big game about Wall St - but he's hired enough @GoldmanSachs alums to open a new bank branch” at the White House. \nBut Republicans were happy to see him confirmed, seeing him as an ally to start cutting banking regulations. \n“Mr. Mnuchin will help implement that change with a fresh, new regulatory framework that cuts the bureaucratic red tape that costs our economy trillions of dollars each year,\" Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) said. \nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called him an \"outstanding\" pick in his statement following the vote. \nThe Senate also voted to confirm David Shulkin to head the Department of Veterans Affairs. Shulkin already worked in the VA as an assistant head and won unanimous bipartisan support.
