Afinidad-Bernardo (philstar.com)   11:16am Miss Universe Philippines 2016 Maxine Medina is announced as a top 6 finalist during The 65th Miss Universe telecast last January 29 from the Mall of Asia Arena. Miss Universe Organization/Tom Starkweather \nMANILA, Philippines — Red is the lucky color of the year, feng shui master Aldric Dalumpines says, but not for Miss Philippines Maxine Medina. \nMedina, who landed in the Miss Universe top 6, could have gone further if only she did not wear red, Dalumpines confides in an interview with Philstar.com. \nMaxine’s birth year, says Dalumpines, is a wood element, while the year when the pageant was held in the Mall of Asia Arena already falls in the Fire Rooster. So, wearing red, the color of fire, for a wood element means being “fire roasted,” he claims. \nHer choice of gown color made it hard for her to answer the final question because red, which alludes fire, could be burdensome to a wood element, the feng shui expert alleges. So, what color should Maxine have worn? \n“Yellow or gold so everything could have been light for her,” says Dalumpines. \nNotice that the final three – France, Haiti, and Colombia –all wore gold, and the rest was history.
