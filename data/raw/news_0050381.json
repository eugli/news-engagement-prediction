Mann is undertaking naturopathy course with Kejriwal at Bengaluru. \n\nThe picture shows Mann without his trademark yellow turban and Kejriwal in sports shoes instead of sandals. The picture has attracted lots of comments, including many adverse remarks. \n\nBoth Kejriwal and Mann have also uploaded a video clip claiming that AAP was sure to form the government in Punjab. In the photo, the whole group seems to be enjoying an easy bonhomie. AAP had projected Mann in run up to the February 4 assembly elections as its star campaigner and he addressed more than 200 rallies in less than a month drawing big crowds across the state. \n\n\nApart from Mann, party's legal face H S Phoolka and state convener Gurpreet Singh Waraich also are considered heavy weights and probable chief ministerial candidates if AAP gets majority in Punjab. AAP has again made it clear that a Punjabi would be their CM in Punjab. There are already some Facebook pages projecting either Waraich or Phoolka as the next CM. \n\n\"Clout of Mann in AAP is unparalleled. With this picture, it seems to have grown further. Party volunteers see him playing a big role in the AAP government,\" said party's Malwa zone media in charge Neel Garg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:28:41.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
