Getty Images Trevor Arroyo FOX Sports San Diego Feb 4, 2017 at 9:01p ET 0Shares \nDespite missing the first four games of the season, Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa earned the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year award on Saturday in a landslide. \nThe former Ohio State Buckeye had 10.5 sacks on the season, the most by a rookie since Aldon Smith had 14 in 2011. Bosa also compiled 41 tackles in his 12 games played, 19 of which were for a loss. \nBosa’s rookie season began with some controversy though, as a contract holdout led to some missed time followed by a hamstring injury. But he made his mark quickly in his first game, earning two sacks against the Oakland Raiders. His 10.5 in 2016 were the most sacks by a Charger rookie since Shawne Merriman’s 10 in 2005.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:23:04.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
