(Photo: Angelo Martinez photo provided by @SnapsInc.) \nGiven a new name, a popular Geist restaurant will not party as hard. \nBella Vita, 11699 Fall Creek Road, has been renovated and rebranded as LakeHouse at Geist. \nGeneral manager Rachel Mills said the LakeHouse concept is geared for the boating life on Geist Reservoir, a 74-year-old man-made lake known for wealthy athletes and executives who live on its shores. \nLakeHouse, which opened Feb. 1 following a month of remodeling, shifted its menu away from Bella Vita's Italian entrees to an increased emphasis on seafood. During warm weather, the restaurant will offer dockside service to customers on boats. \nSunday pool parties, perhaps Bella Vita's defining attraction in recent years, won't return this summer.

In 2016, the weekly parties were renamed \"Revive Sundays\" in 2016. \nMills said LakeHouse plans to remove its pool and replace it with a large tiki bar. \n“It will cater more to the people who are right around the lake, who were maybe put off by the loud, crazy wildness of what the Rehab and Revive brought,” Mills said. \nLive music will be a fixture at the tiki bar, Mills said. Meanwhile, a new stage inside LakeHouse is showcasing acts such as Lemon Wheel (Feb. 10), Andrew Young (Feb. 14) and Toy Factory (Feb. 17). \nAlso new to the restaurant is chef Jay Mills, the general manager's brother-in-law. \n“Our goal is to do light, refreshing dishes,\" Rachel Mills said. \nShe said the transformation from Bella Vita to LakeHouse underscores a change in ownership at the restaurant, which actually happened more than two years ago. Jack Singh and his brother, Shaan, purchased Bella Vita from Henri and Shelly Najem in 2014. \n“We see new faces and old faces every day, so it’s been really great,\" Mills said of LakeHouse's launch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T18:37:49.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
