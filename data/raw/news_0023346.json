Lucky for us, 2017 is seeing new releases from many of them, some series continuations, others entirely new stories. We've got new books coming from Sarah J. Maas, Renee Ahdieh, Victoria Aveyard, Marie Lu and even more fan favorites. And while the hype surrounding them is real, and we're beyond excited to read them, we're also looking forward to dipping into new fantasy worlds from less established fantasy authors. These writers are bringing their A-Game with new plots, new worlds, incredible new magic systems and even more diversity than ever before. \nThese 13 upcoming releases include everything from sci-fi fantasy to those inspired by legendary myths, and many represent diverse casts of characters that include people of color, gender fluid people, and LGBT people. Though fantasy novels are the ultimate way to spend some time outside of our own world, we also know that it’s beyond important to see real world representation in everything that we read. If you’re looking to fall in love with some new obsession-worthy reads, we’ve got you more than covered. 1 'Empress of a Thousand Skies' by Rhoda Belleza (February 7, 2017) \nThis recent sci-fi fantasy release from Rhoda Belleza has been billed as Game of Thrones in space and we are so on board.

But when he’s falsely accused of killing Rhee, he's forced to prove his innocence to save his reputation – and his life. With planets on the brink of war, Rhee and Aly are thrown together to confront a ruthless evil that threatens the fate of the entire galaxy.

She spies on the girls―and on the soldiers escorting them. As the girls' military escort senses a political uprising, Sage is recruited by a handsome soldier to infiltrate the enemy ranks. The more she discovers as a spy, the less certain she becomes about whom to trust―and Sage becomes caught in a dangerous balancing act that will determine the fate of her kingdom. An obsession-worthy tempestuous romance and secret identities make this Jane Austen with an espionage twist. \nClick here to buy. 3 'Daughter of the Pirate King' by Tricia Levenseller (February 28, 2017) \nAnother first book in a series, Daughter of the Pirate King introduces us to a YA female Captain Jack Sparrow, and if that's not enough to hook you, we don't know what will.

More than a match for the ruthless pirate crew, Alosa has only one thing standing between her and the map: her captor, the unexpectedly clever and unfairly attractive first mate, Riden. But not to worry, for Alosa has a few tricks up her sleeve, and no lone pirate can stop the Daughter of the Pirate King.

But while Amrita feels responsible for her kingdom and sets out to warn her people, the newly free Thala has no such ties.

When Sal steals a flyer for an audition to become a member of The Left Hand ― the Queen's personal assassins, named after the rings she wears ― Sal jumps at the chance to infiltrate the court and get revenge. But the audition is a fight to the death filled with clever circus acrobats, lethal apothecaries, and vicious ex-soldiers. A childhood as a common criminal hardly prepared Sal for the trials.

Braeden Tennant wants two things: to get out from his mother's shadow, and to unlearn Epsilon's darkest secret. They’ll both have to commit treason to find the truth.
