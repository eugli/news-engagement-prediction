ADVERTISEMENT \nThe news article said protesters calling for the resumption of peace talks between the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front reached Gate 2 of the Malacañang compound, which is near the building that houses the press working area. \nThe PSG not only confiscated the banners carried by the protesters but also the video footage of the rally. \nOne reporter reportedly “engaged in a tug of war for his cellphone.” \nNUJP said what the PSG did was a “clear overreach.” \nIt pointed out that the PSG, which is “supposed to be among the most elite of the country’s security forces, (does) not possess even the most basic appreciation” of what the media does and “of the limits that the law imposes on their authority.” \nThe group reminded the PSG that they have sworn to “protect and defend” the people, “not prevent the lawful exercise of their rights and liberties.” \n“We call on the presidential task force on media safety to immediately look into this incident and ensure that disciplinary measures are implemented as needed and such an incident does not happen again,” NUJP said.
