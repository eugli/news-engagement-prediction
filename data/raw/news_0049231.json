While most couples seem to embrace parenthood at a certain age, there have been rare occasions when elderly people have given birth to children or fathered a child.\nThe latest in such medical miracles has been reported from Dubai where a Sri Lankan origin woman of 63 gave birth to a child after undergoing IVF in India. The woman and the child are both said to be healthy as the infant weighs 2.25 kg.\nThe delivery was carried out by Dr Jagraud Nirmala and the names of the couple were not disclosed. The woman’s husband hails from Chennai and told Gulf News that his entire family is thrilled after the birth.\nThe woman had her last child 13 years back from her previous marriage and underwent IVF after getting married for a second time. Last year a 72-year-old woman from Haryana called Daljinder Kaur gave birth to a child through IVF.\nThe doctor did mention that it is risky for women to get pregnant after 60 since women in their 40s are suffering from conditions like hypertension.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:59:51.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
