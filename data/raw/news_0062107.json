Dr. Luke initially tried to shrug off the emails he sent to Kesha, claiming he’d be vindicated in court even after the world learned he’d basically told her he didn’t ”give a shit” about her input on her own music. \nNow Rolling Stone reports that he’s asked to enter some of his own emails into evidence, in which he compliments Kesha on her appearance. There are also reportedly messages in which Kesha’s team expresses concerns about her meal plan and fitness regime, as well as deems her behavior “soo [sic] erratic.” Regarding that whole not caring about her opinion on lyrics she’d eventually sing on “Crazy Kids,” Gottwald claims Kesha’s batch of emails is a “self-serving and false characterization” that “intentionally omits the highly relevant fact that Gottwald asked a prominent third-party writer to provide alternative lyrics—specifically to address Kesha’s concerns.” \nThese email releases are just the latest stage in their court battle, which has seen Kesha seeking the court’s help in breaking ties with Gottwald, whom she alleges abused her sexually, physically, and verbally. Kesha and Dr. Luke’s representatives declined to comment to Rolling Stone on this latest filing. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:48:23.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
