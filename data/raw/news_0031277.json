At least, that's the case for this Taylor Swift lookalike who uses makeup to transform into the star. \nApril Gloria is a cosplayer that has a pretty wicked hand when it comes to a makeup brush, transforming her already eerily-similar features into near Taylor duplicates. From the mouth to her eyes, she's almost a carbon copy. \nA quick scroll though her Instagram feed is like looking at a Swift photo album. From the flawless, snow white skin, to the red lipstick that accents her cupid's bow, she has all of Swift's beauty moves down to a tee. She also rocks a retro cat eye with heavily fanned lashes, which helps her get those sharp, feline-like eyes that Swift loves. If you would put the two women next to each other, chances are you would think they were separated at birth. It's eerie and amazing all at the same time.
