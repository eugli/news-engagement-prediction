I entered the room to get him water and then food to eat, but noticed two men walked in wearing masks. \n“I really did not understand what was going on. Then I heard gunshot. They shot my husband in the head and his brain splashed all over the place. \n“They (his killers) took to their heels. What you are looking at covered with zinc is particles of his brain and blood that spread all over when they shot him. I still can’t believe this happened; it is still like a bad dream. \n“I was confused and started calling his political friends because he was also involved in politics. They came and called the police from Atakpa Police Division and other security operatives. \n“The truth is that my husband is gone; they took him from us leaving me and six children. Where do I start from?” Nwafor Polycarp ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:33:55.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
