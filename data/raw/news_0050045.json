Credit: Alamy Nick Squires , Rome 21 February 2017 • 3:59pm \nB ears in Italy are emerging from hibernation early as a result of unseasonably mild winter temperatures, in an alarming sign of the effects of global warming on Europe’s wildlife. \nItaly’s population of brown bears is small and closely monitored, which is why environmentalists know that a big adult male, nicknamed Francesco, recently came out of hibernation after just 48 days. \nThe bear, which lives in a mountain range close to Italy’s border with Slovenia, emerged from its den as temperatures reached 17C (62F) and snow began to melt. \nWildlife rangers said the animal, which weighs nearly 190kg, could now start to cause problems in the region. There is no natural food yet in the mountains, so he may have to come down to the valleys to raid orchards, beehives and rubbish bins. \nThe nine-year-old bear is fitted with a radio collar, enabling scientists to track his movements in the Carnic Alps, a range of mountains in the northern region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. They know that his hibernation not only ended early, it started late – it was not until December 13 that he crept into his den to sleep. Brown bears were reintroduced into northern Italy from neighbouring Slovenia.

He fattened up, then when the cold weather hit, he went to sleep,” said Stefano Filacorda, a researcher from the University of Udine. \n“January was the coldest for 30 years and he slept well, but last week it was warmer at altitudes of 1,500 metres than it was down in the valleys – there was a temperature inversion and it woke him up,” he told La Repubblica newspaper. \nB rown bears were driven almost to extinction in Italy after centuries of trapping, shooting and poaching. But in the late 1990s, a group of 10 bears was introduced from Slovenia as part of a EU-funded project to re-establish the species in Italy. \nThey flourished in the alpine meadows and conifer forests and there are now estimated to be around 50 bears living in Italy’s north-east , which is dominated by the Dolomites. \n“Shorter hibernation periods are now quite common,” said Piero Genovesi, a bear expert with the Institute for Environmental Research and Protection. “The phenomenon is linked to the lack of snow. This year in particular, there was very little snow. The bear will now be moving around at a time when there is little food, and that will be stressful for him.” Ibex are also being adversely affected by rising temperatures in the Alps and Dolomites.

The feeding habits of creatures such as the ibex and the ptarmigan are also being affected by rising temperatures, according to WWF Italia. \n“The survival rate of ibex has dropped from 50 per cent in the 1980s to 25 per cent today,” the conservation organisation said in a report in November 2015, blaming rising temperatures on climate change. \nLast year was the planet’s warmest since record-keeping began in the 1880s, the World Meteorological Organisation announced last month. Sixteen of the 17 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000. \nTemperatures in 2016 were 1.1 degree Celsius, or 1.98 degrees Fahrenheit, above the pre-industrial average, according to the WMO. A record El Nino weather phenomenon was partly responsible for the spike in temperatures, but scientists blamed most of the increase on human activities. \nConservationists have celebrated the return of the brown bear to Italy, but farmers and landowners are less thrilled. They complain that the animals raid their orchards and bee hives and kill livestock, including goats and sheep .
