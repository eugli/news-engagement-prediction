He was reelected in 2016. Story continues below \nHe told Global News that while campaigning in the summer, many of the concerns residents brought to his attention were provincial in nature, like the need for a new school in Hammonds Plains, senior’s pharmacare, the Nova Scotia film industry, the “Bluenose boondoggle” and the teachers’ negotiations. \nIn a statement, Whitman said “we need our MLAs to speak up” regarding the need for schools and fair negotiating. \nAlthough he did not confirm what will happen Thursday, Whitman said, “I’ve enjoyed collaborating with my colleagues and residents & staff on municipal matters and would appreciate the opportunity to do the same on provincial issues. HRM is in good hands. I’d be pleased to help provincially.” \nPC Party campaign manager Chad Bowie tweeted on Wednesday that “strong” candidates were “stepping forward” on Thursday. Big news coming tomorrow! Strong @nspc candidates stepping forward. Momentum is building! #nspoli \n— Chad Bowie (@ChadBowie) February 1, 2017 \nNo date has been set yet for the election.
