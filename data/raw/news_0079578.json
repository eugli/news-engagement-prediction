"english", "persons": [], "text": "Feb 28, 2017 at 10:16a ET 0Shares \nWith the 25th offseason of the modern NFL hot stove just beginning, FOX Sports looks back through recent history to select the 25 best free agents since the league adopted the (mostly) unfettered acquisition process we know today. This isn't a list of the greatest players to hit free agency. It ranks players by how successful they were with their new teams. Longevity is a key component. A Hall of Famer playing for two years on a team isn't necessarily a better signing than a Pro Bowler who stays a decade. Still, success, and the awards that often accompany it, is the overwhelming criteria. Which player stands as the best free agent in NFL history? The answer may surprise you. Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports Ron Chenoy 25 WR Plaxico Burress (2005 Giants) \nPesky jail sentence aside, Burress had 33 regular-season touchdowns in four years with the Giants, not to mention the game-winner in Super Bowl XLII to beat the 18-0 Patriots. Getty Images Getty Images 24 LB London Fletcher (2007 Redskins) \nOf all the big-name, high-priced, hype-driving free-agent talent that made the Redskins six-peat as offseason champs, who'd have thought the minor signing of a 32-year-old linebacker with no Pro Bowls to his name would turn out to be the best? Fletcher captained a Redskins defense for seven years, playing at a high level until he retired at 38 and after making that elusive Pro Bowl four times over. Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports 23 LB Bryce Paup (1995 Bills) \nAfter four straight Super Bowl appearances, Buffalo missed the postseason in 1994 and the window seemed not just shut, but locked, barred and barricaded. Then the Bills signed Paup out of Green Bay. He had 17.5 sacks his first season and won Defensive Player of the Year. Buffalo made it back to the playoffs, but you know how that story always ends. This content is subject to copyright. Getty Images 22 QB Brad Johnson (2001 Buccaneers) \nAs you'll see throughout this list, Super Bowl wins are placed at a high premium because, hello, you play to win the game. Johnson was good in Minnesota and then quite good in Washington, going 10-6 and 7-4 in his two seasons before somebody's obsession with Jeff George caused a bizarre benching. In a situation that in no way mirrors today, the Redskins didn't appreciate the services of a good quarterback. Johnson signed with Tampa, where he won a Super Bowl in his second season. But y'all keep on playing hardball with Kirk Cousins and enjoy making the playoffs twice a decade. Getty Images Focus On Sport 21 K Adam Vinatieri (2006 Colts) \nToo high for a kicker? Not when you're the best ever, nor in an era in which teams cycle through kickers like Taylor Swift does fake boyfriends. Some trivia: Vinatieri has been in Indy (11 seasons) longer than he was in New England (10 seasons). 20 WR Ed McCaffrey (1995 Broncos) \nNot necessarily your first thought for, well, anything, but McCaffrey was picked up off the scrap heap by Denver and eventually became a integral part of an offense that won two Super Bowls. Maybe being a receiver on a team with John Elway and Terrell Davis is a bit like being Ringo Starr, but three 1,000-yard seasons, a Pro Bowl and two rings push Easy Ed ahead of other free-agent receivers who might have posted gaudier numbers. This content is subject to copyright. Getty Images 19 QB Jake Delhomme (2003 Panthers) \nDelhomme was a backup in New Orleans and had a stint in the World League before catching on with Carolina for a $400,000 signing bonus. He started the season as a backup to Rodney Peete, was playing by the second half of Week 1 and got the Panthers to within one possession of a Super Bowl win four months later. He was never spectacular in Charlotte (and the $42.5 million extension may have been pushing it), but he'll always have 2003. 18 CB Troy Vincent (1996 Eagles) \nThe seventh pick of the 1992 draft left Miami for greener pastures and played eight years in Philly, making five Pro Bowls and one All-Pro team and efffectively shutting down the left side of the field for the Eagles for close to a decade. This content is subject to copyright. Getty Images 17 DE Simeon Rice (2001 Buccaneers) \nRice sacks, first five seasons in Tampa: 11.0, 15.5, 15.0, 12.0, 14.0. The former Cardinals star (who had the misfortune of getting injured in his contract year) was a key component of the bruising Bucs defense that won Super Bowl XXXVII. Rice retired 14th on the all-time sacks list. 16 QB Brett Favre (2009 Vikings) \n'Tis better to have gunslinged and lost than to have never gunslinged at all. 15 LB James Farrior (2002) \nA decade in Pittsburgh, a second-team all-decade selection and a full season's worth of playoff starts -- including two Super Bowl wins -- all for a guy who commanded a $1.7 signing bonus. 14 C Kevin Mawae (1998 Jets) \nThe most similar players to Mawae, according to the statistical comparison tool on pro-football-reference.com : Mike Webster, Gene Upshaw, Jim Otto, Steve Wisniewski, Larry Allen, John Hannah, Gary Zimmerman, Will Shields, Walter Jones and Jonathan Ogden. All but one (Wisniewski) are Hall of Famers, and Mawae played eight of his 16 seasons in New York. This content is subject to copyright. Getty Images 13 CB Deion Sanders (1994 49ers) \nAfter losing two straight NFC title games to the Dallas Cowboys -- thanks in part to Michael Irvin and Alvin Harper having their way with the Niners secondary -- San Francisco won the Deion sweepstakes over the 25 percent of the NFL that publicly expressed interest and the other 75 percent that didn't but still probably kicked the tires. The deal wasn't signed until mid-September, when baseball season officially ended (the strike was on, but Deion was still under obligation to play for the Reds until it did), but it paid off. Sanders won Defensive POY, had the second-most interception return yards in NFL history and the fourth-most interception touchdowns en route to routs in the NFC championship (vs. Dallas) and Super Bowl (vs. San Diego). Deion was a one-hit wonder, but oh what a hit it was. NFL Joseph Patronite 12 LB Ken Norton Jr. (1994 49ers) \nDeion was a key addition, but the addition of Ken Norton Jr. had a two-pronged effect: He gave those 49ers teams the dominant linebacker they needed and, as a bonus, he came from Dallas. Addition both by addition and another team's subtraction. Norton played seven years with the Niners. This content is subject to copyright. Getty Images 11 LB Mike Vrabel (2001 Patriots) \nIs Vrabel the most Patriots player ever? Average pedigree (a third-rounder), not any great success with his first team, goes to New England and turns into a situational star. He was a leader of those Bill Belichick defenses but didn't get much league-wide recognition (one Pro Bowl) outside of the scheme. He became an unlikely offensive hero, scoring two Super Bowl touchdowns. Then, in true Pats fashion, he was unceremoniously traded for the final two years of his career, playing out the string in Kansas City. Getty Images Getty Images 10 QB Kurt Warner (2005 Cardinals) \nThe grocery clerk becoming an NFL MVP was just the first part of Warner's bizarre football odyssey. Eight months after taking the field in the Super Bowl as one of the biggest favorites in the history of the game and the unquestioned leader of one of the league's greatest offenses, Warner was unceremoniously booted from his starting gig (for Jamie Martin!) after the Rams went 0-4 to start 2002. (It led to this brilliant line from Mike Silver in Sports Illustrated : \"The Greatest Show on Turf is strictly an off-Broadway production.\") \nUnbelievably, Warner's last win in St. Louis came two weeks before the loss to a young Tom Brady and the upstart Patriots. He went to New York in 2004 in order to help ease Eli Manning into the starting role (Warner started 4-1 but was benched at 5-4). Then, with his career seemingly in shambles, Warner signed with the hapless Cardinals, who had made the playoffs just once in the past 23 seasons. \nIn Phoenix, Warner did nothing to change the perception that he was washed up. He started his career 3-12, was benched for Matt Leinart and turned 37 before the 2008 season. It seemed over. But in one of the great second acts of this sporting century, Warner beat out Leinart for the job, led the Cards to a playoff berth, threw for the most passing yards in postseason history and made a surprise Super Bowl appearance in the most thrilling NFL title game ever, coming within a Santonio Holmes tiptoe of victory. The next year, Warner went 10-5 and played in one of the great playoff games in history (a 51-45 win over Green Bay) before the Saints ended his career in the divisional round. Getty Images 9 G Steve Hutchinson (2006 Vikings) \nHutchinson was one of the top guards in the game and coming off his second All-Pro team when the Vikings offered him seven years, $49 million. The Seahawks declined to match (upsetting Hutchinson, who wanted to stay) and Minnesota had the left side of its line on lockdown for the next six years. USA TODAY Sports Brace Hemmelgarn-USA TODAY Sport 8 CB Charles Woodson (2006 Packers) \nWoodson, the Oakland Raiders superstar and former Heisman Trophy winner, was considered a risk when he hit free agency in 2006. It'd been four seasons since he played a full schedule, and he made just six starts in his free-agent season. Woodson was only 29 though and proved durable in Green Bay, missing just three starts in his first six years. Though he ended up making the switch a lot of top cornerbacks do -- moving to safety -- Woodson played a vital role in Green Bay's resurgence in the late Favre years and bridged the gap into the Aaron Rodgers era -- winning defensive POY in 2009 and getting a ring with the team in 2010. Diamond Images/Getty Images Diamond Images 7 QB Rich Gannon (Raiders 1999) \nThe NFL was slightly less than abuzz when Gannon signed with Oakland in 1999. \"Finally, journeyman quarterback Rich Gannon is getting his chance as a full-time starter,\" the AP blared in a siren-worthy write-up , and the Oakland Raiders, souring on Jeff George, are giving it to him.\" A backup for 11 years, Gannon had little expectations of doing much with a mediocre Raiders team and its young head coach. But under Jon Gruden, the Raiders offense flourished and Gannon improbably turned into an NFL MVP at age 37. Starting in 2000, he made four straight Pro Bowls, made two All-Pro teams and led Oakland to three straight playoff berths. The last one ended with a Super Bowl loss to the Bucs. The year before, Gannon's Raiders were robbed in the Tuck Rule game, denying the opportunity for a high-powered offensive Super Bowl battle with the Rams. George Gojkovich Getty Images 6 RB Priest Homes (2001 Chiefs) \nAfter not touching the ball as a rookie, Holmes had 1,000 rushing yards for the 1998 Ravens before injuries derailed him in 1999 and Jamal Lewis usurped him in 2000. The Texas product hit the market, was signed by the Chiefs and led the league in yards from scrimmage in each of his first two seasons (2,169 and 2,287 yards, respectively). Since he had signed as an injured backup running back, Holmes' first Kansas City contract didn't earn him much -- he got about $2.5 million for those two years he was unquestionably the top back in football. So, after threatening a hold out at the start of 2003, he signed a $35 million deal, had one more great season, started spectacularly in 2004 (892 yards and 14 TD through eight games) and then suffered a season-ending injury. He would never be the same. Getty Images Ronald Martinez 5 CB Deion Sanders (1995 Cowboys) \nAfter his one-year stint in San Francisco, Deion was a free agent again and went a-courtin' all summer and into the season, sitting out Week 1 while he made his decision about which suitor would get the services of Primetime. The Cowboys, who had twice lost to the Niners the year before (in the regular season and NFC championship) thanks in part to Sanders covering Michael Irvin, eventually plucked him away. The Niners, of course, had signed Deion to beat the Cowboys, and did. Days before the signing, the Cowboys signed a sponsorship agreement with Nike, the company that just happened to represent Deion. It went over about as well as you'd think. He'd stay five years, win a Super Bowl, make three first-team All-Pro squads and then leave in 2000, whereupon he signed a much less successful free agent deal with Dan Snyder's Washington Redskins. Getty Images Photo Illustration/FOXSports.com 4 DE Reggie White (1993 Packers) \nWhite, whose contract with the Philadelphia Eagles fortuitously ended the same year modern free agency began, was the first major free agent of the modern era. That, coupled with the fact that he was a defensive monster -- a first-ballot Hall of Famer who helped change the culture of Green Bay en route to a Super Bow -- puts him at No. 1 on most of these lists. But the numbers don't lie: White was a six-time All-Pro with Philly (1986-91). In Green Bay, he was still great but made just two All-Pro teams, in 1995 and 1998. The obvious reason is that White played in Philadelphia in his prime and didn't get to Lambeau until he was 32. He was a fading superstar. The best free agents are the ones who have their best years in front of them. (Also, as for the culture change; I'd argue that was due as much to Mike Holmgren and Brett Favre. Name another major free agent who went to Green Bay in the decade after White.) Getty Images 3 RB Curtis Martin (1998 Jets) \nIn yet another salvo of the Jets-Patriots beef, Bill Parcells stunned the NFL when he signed the 24-year-old Martin, a restricted free agent, to a $36 million deal, parting with a first- and third-round pick in order to do so. (Martin was a restricted free agent, and the Pats lowballed him so badly it'd make Kirk Cousins' head spin.) Martin had been drafted by Parcells when he was coaching New England, and the Tuna was enamored of the shifty back for all the usual reasons, but for his leadership, class and professionalism, too. \nTo make sure New England wouldn't counter, Parcells and Mike Tannenbaum cooked up a delicious poison pill deal, which gave Martin the ability to void his deal after one year and would have disallowed the Pats from using the franchise tag. The Patriots couldn't match that because of the possibility they'd lose Martin in 1999. Getting two draft picks was better than nothing. \nMartin started all but one game in his first seven years with New York, finished with 1,000 yards in each, went over 1,400 three times (including an NFL-high 1,697 when he was 31 years old) and eventually became a slam-dunk Hall of Famer. Only once in Martin's seven full seasons did the Jets finish under .500. \nThere were no Super Bowls and just one championship game appearance, but getting a Hall of Famer in the prime of his career (with the help of some mischievious contract wording) is enough to dwarf that. Sporting News Sporting News via Getty Images 2 QB Peyton Manning (2012 Broncos) \nYes, Peyton played only four seasons in Denver. Yes, he could only throw a football in three of those seasons. Yes, you could argue the Broncos won Super Bowl 50 in spite of Peyton not because of him. Still, though Manning was clearly done in 2015, his transformation of the Broncos offense and making his teammates better allowed a dead-armed quarterback and Brock Osweiler to survive just enough to let the defense win a championship. It was the least they could do after Manning carried the team for three years with his arm. \nWhen it was feared Manning couldn't come back from the neck injury that ended his career in Indianapolis, he promptly went 13-3 with career highs in completion percentage and yards in that first season with the Broncos. The next season he had the greatest quarterbacking year the NFL has ever seen, breaking the record for single-season TD passes (55) and throwing for a staggering 5,477 yards. \nThe playoff losses were brutal. Denver was the favorite to win it all in Manning's first year, but Chris Harris let Jacoby Jones get open downfield in the divisional playoffs and the Ravens stunned a Broncos team that had all but wrapped up the game. A Super Bowl appearance in 2014 started and ended in disaster. Manning was subpar in 2015 when he lost to his former team. And then there was the ring in near-absentia in his final game. (Manning's numbers in Super Bowl 50: 13/23, 141 yards, 0 TD, 1 INT, 5 sacks, 56.6 QBR.) \nRegardless, no free agent has ever transformed a team as greatly as Manning did the Broncos. In January of 2012 they were quarterbacked by Tim Tebow and needed divine intervention to both make the playoffs and somehow win a game there. Months later, after winning the biggest free-agent sweepstakes ever, the Denver Broncos immediately became a Super Bowl contender. Who else can you say that about? Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved. AP 1 QB Drew Brees (2006 Saints) \nAfter drafting Philip Rivers, the San Diego Chargers had no need for the very good, but not great, Drew Brees. Thus, a young talented starting quarterback hit the open market for the first (and last) time. Brees ended up in New Orleans after the Dolphins passed on him in favor of Daunte Culpepper. (Take notes, Redskins.) Eleven years later, Brees has brought New Orleans its first Super Bowl ring, led the franchise to five more playoff victories than it had in its first 38 seasons combined, won two Offensive POY awards, made nine Pro Bowls and is in striking distance of setting career records in passing yardage, among others. (Touchdowns and completions look just out of reach, but if Brees can play at a high level until he's 40, they're up for grabs too.) Oh yeah, he's missed two starts in 11 years. \nThe gaudy numbers haven't always translated into team success, though. Under Brees, the Saints have finished at .500 or worse in six seasons compared to five years with a winning record. No matter. He still gets the nod as the best free agent in NFL history. Drew Brees changed the culture of a franchise, brought that elusive playoff success, won an unthinkable championship and has been a community leader like few players the league has ever seen -- especially important given that Brees began his time in New Orleans in the first season after Hurricane Kartina.
