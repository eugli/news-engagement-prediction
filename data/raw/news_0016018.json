No one accidentally swigging from your over-priced cup of coke, no awkward, accidental foot rub with the stranger next to you. \nAnd now imagine something even more magical - you have gone to watch the latest blockbuster on your own. \nFor those who have just let out a plausible gasp, hear me out: there is so much joy to be had in doing things on your own. \nYou can choose which film to see in the cinema without argument or you can enjoy a whole portion of chips at lunch without a cheeky finger sneaking in and stealing one. \nAnd it's ok. \nIt's also totally ok to sit in the corner of your local boozer, your fingers circling the rim of your pint as you immerse yourself in a novel, watch sport on the widescreen or simply people-watch. \nEmbrace the rise of solitude, take a country walk on your day off. I've done it several times in my local country park, as have I visited art galleries and museums alone. \nIf you don't feel comfortable going on a hilly trek, visit a nearby park or nature trail. Feed the ducks, take in the (relatively) fresh air. Why not? Clifton Country Park is ideal for a wander on your own \nGoing to the cinema solo is my latest favourite thing. And I'm not alone (pun intended). I had a random Monday off and no plans so headed to HOME to watch Manchester by The Sea for an afternoon screening. Of the 12 or so people in the intimate screening, 10 of them were sitting by themselves. \nI later headed to a coffee shop in the Northern Quarter, fired up my laptop and checked some emails. Both activities I was completely comfortable with on my lonesome. \nBut why is the latter seen as so much more socially acceptable? \nMaybe it was going to the pictures in the daytime at an arthouse-style cinema rather than a multiplex on a Saturday evening. \nI wouldn't rule out braving the Odeon at 8pm on a Friday or Saturday night on my tod, I've just not had the opportunity or urge to do it yet. \nHow is going to the gym on your own any different to sitting in the theatre on your lonesome, enjoying a show you have been DYING to see but none of your friends want to watch? On both occasions you are unlikely to talk to anyone the whole time. Would you rather miss out on the production, than say 'screw it, I'm going on my own'? Preview of the newly built HOME (Photo: Joel Goodman) \nAnd if you're lucky, you could land yourself with one of the best seats in the house, as single tickets can be cheaper and the theatre will want to fill all rows in the stalls and at the front of the circle. \nNow, I'm not saying solitude is the future and expecting you to go tenpin bowling on your own (beating your mates' score is the only reason for going) anytime soon. \nAnd of course, it is a flexible notion completely personal to you. I HATE running on my own, but others really see the benefits and use it as their time to whack on a playlist and block out the world. \nBut what is holding you back? \nUntil recently, I wasn't totally cool with eating an evening meal in a restaurant on my own. https://www.instagram.com/p/BK61E79go42/?taken-by=densterevo/embed \nHowever, I took a solo trip across Nova Scotia and apart from one meal, it was a case of 'table for one'. It was strange at first and made me self-conscious, worrying about whether the other diners were thinking I'd been stood up for a date. \nThe first few times I took a book with me, but then I decided to look up from the pages and read the new surroundings around me. \nI soaked up the ambience, appreciated the artwork and decor, engaged with the waiter a little more, caught the eye of the adjacent table and smiled. On one occasion I had a night cap or five at the bar with a couple of locals, discussing everything from the impending Presidential Election to my favourite Manchester United player. \nOwn your solitude.
