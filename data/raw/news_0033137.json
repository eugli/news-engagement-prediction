Show EPA staffers you care.” \nThe call-out netted “thousands” of notes, many of which Stand.earth published Tuesday. Here are just a few: “We’re still watching, listening, and paying attention. We still care.” “At least a quarter-billion people in this country want EPA to keep doing what it’s always done. We hope you’ll thwart what Trump tries to do. We’ll give you all the support we can!” “Stand strong. Stand together. Persist. am a great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin, and he is with you in spirit.” “Roses are red, violets are blue. We wouldn’t have an EPA if it weren’t for you! Have a ripping good Valentine’s Day and keep up the excellent work. You are appreciated!” “There are over 7 billion people depending on the work and science you all do. Hang tight where you are and we’ll keep up the fight out here. A handful of fascist lunatics do NOT have the right to destroy OUR planet.” \nThe group isn’t sending notes to individual employees but is working to make sure the agency sees them, said Stand.earth spokesman Ross Hammond. \n“We don’t want to get folks in trouble, so we’ve been posting them on social media to channels where we know EPA staff congregate and sharing them as well on some Listservs,” he said. Portland Press Herald via Getty Images Protesters in Portland, Maine, rally to urge Republican Sen. Susan Collins to block the nomination of Scott Pruitt as head of the EPA. \nLast week, hundreds of current and former EPA employees gathered in Chicago to protest Pruitt, Trump’s nominee for EPA administrator. And 447 former EPA staffers signed a letter calling for the Senate to reject Pruitt, saying his record raises “serious questions” about his ability to act in the public interest. \nPruitt, Oklahoma’s attorney general, has deep ties to the oil and gas industries , and has sued the EPA more than a dozen times . His LinkedIn page describes him as “a leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda.” \nDoug Ericksen, the other person mentioned by Stand.earth, is head of communications for Trump’s EPA transition team, Ericksen has notoriously stated that “climate change will always happen.” One of his first moves on the job was to announce that the work of EPA scientists will be subject to internal review to ensure “the voice coming from the EPA is one that’s going to reflect the new administration.” \nIf you’d like to show EPA staffers some love, you can still do so here. Why Scott Pruitt Is A 'Dangerous' Choice To Lead The EPA Why Scott Pruitt Is A 'Dangerous' Choice To Lead The EPA 1 4 He has threatened to undermine protections for air and water. Trump is no environmental champion , but even he has said it's “vitally important\" to have “ crystal clean ” air and water. Pruitt, however, has proven himself to be antagonistic to even this idea. Since taking office as Oklahoma’s attorney general in 2010, Pruitt has sued the EPA on multiple occasions in a effort to overturn rules limiting air pollution from power plants -- including the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule , which curbs power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards , which place limits on the amount of mercury, arsenic and other toxic pollution.As Elliott Negin, a senior writer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, explained earlier this month , those are both life-saving regulations: “Taken together, they are projected to prevent 18,000 to 46,000 premature deaths across the country and save $150 billion to $380 billion in health care costs annually. In Pruitt’s home state, the two regulations would avert as many as 720 premature deaths and save as much as $5.9 billion per year.”Pruitt sued the EPA in 2015 over the Waters of the United States rule -- which, in a piece co-written with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), he called the “greatest blow to private property rights the modern era has seen.” The rule , which is currently tied up in the courts, extends EPA protection to tens of millions of acres of wetlands and millions of miles of streams, including those that 1 in 3 Americans relies on for drinking water .Pruitt also sued the EPA over its 2015 regulation strengthening the national health standards for ground-level ozone or smog pollution.Several of these lawsuits are still ongoing, and environmental advocates have called on Pruitt to recuse himself from decisions related to the regulations he’s challenged in court. Legal experts told Bloomberg, however, that they knew of no rules in place that would compel such an action on Pruitt’s part.“Every American should be appalled that President-elect Trump just picked someone who has made a career of being a vocal defender for polluters to head our Environmental Protection Agency,” Trip Van Noppen, president of Earthjustice, said in a statement last month. “He has fought Environmental Protection Agency pollution limits on toxic substances like soot and mercury that put us all at risk for increased cancer, childhood asthma and other health problems. He falsely claims that fracking doesn’t contaminate drinking water supplies.” Share this slide: Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post? Here’s how.
