Flynn while I was at the White House, and I didn't spend two seconds talking about this, not even one second.\"\nThe Times told NBC News that it stood by its story, saying Cohen told the newspaper he did take a sealed envelope to Flynn's office.\nThe Times said the peace plan was designed to lead to the lifting of international sanctions against Moscow over its seizure of Crimea, a Ukrainian territory.\nMore from NBC News: \nTrump Names Lt.

Sater worked on real estate projects with Trump's company.\n\"I've known Felix for years,\" Cohen said. \"I received a phone call: 'Hey Mike, you have a few minutes? Can I meet you for coffee? You mind if I bring a friend?'

The Times quoted Artemenko as saying he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to Mr. Putin.\nSater, who served time in prison for stabbing a man in the face with broken glass during a Manhattan bar fight, later pleaded guilty to stock manipulation and began cooperating with the FBI and the CIA, according to news reports citing court documents.\nCohen added that even if he had taken an envelope with a Ukrainian peace plan to the White House, \"So what? What's wrong with that?\"\nThe FBI and the U.S. intelligence community have been seeking to corroborate or disprove allegations in an unverified dossier compiled by a former British intelligence agent that makes a series of claims about Trump and his associates. Among them is that Cohen met with a Russian representative in Prague during the presidential campaign to discuss Russia's hacking of the Democrats.\nIn the interview Monday with NBC News, Cohen said he was in Los Angeles when the meeting was supposed to have occurred, taking his son to a meeting with the baseball coach at the University of Southern California.\nTrump's critics, he said, \"are looking to malign President Trump, diminish his historic win and to undermine his presidency by claiming he didn't win â€” that it was given to him by the Russians,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:16:27.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
