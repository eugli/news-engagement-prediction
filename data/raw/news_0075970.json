Lauryn Hill By Scott Mervis / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nLauryn Hill is having a rough time getting it right in Pittsburgh. \nTonight's concert at the Byham, a make-up date for appearing late for a show last month at Heinz Hall, has been postponed. \nThe Pittsburgh Cultural Trust posted on its site: “Due to a scheduling conflict, Ms. Lauryn Hill's performance at the Byham Theater has been moved to Friday, June 2. All tickets purchased for the February 27 show will be valid for the new date.” \nIn May, Hill made her first Pittsburgh appearance in almost 20 years with a performance at the Carnegie of Homestead Music Hall. On a return trip Jan. 31 at Heinz Hall, the singer, known for her late arrivals, tested the patience of fans by not taking the stage until 11:20 p.m., about an hour after many people left, requesting a ticket refund. \nHill apologized, explaining on social media that her band was delayed by bad weather, and scheduled Monday’s concert as a make-up, offering ticketholders from January tickets for half price. \nHow there could have been a scheduling conflict has not been explained. \nScott Mervis: smervis@post-gazette.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:03:03.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
