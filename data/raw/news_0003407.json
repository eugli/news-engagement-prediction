Zero-day leads to BSOD, maybe worse \nAccording to US-CERT experts, the zero-day leads to a Denial-of-Service state that crashes the operating system, and could potentially open the machine to allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with Windows kernel privileges, albeit this scenario has not been officially confirmed yet. \nUS-CERT specialists describe the issue as follows: Microsoft Windows fails to properly handle traffic from a malicious server. In particular, Windows fails to properly handle a server response that contains too many bytes following the structure defined in the SMB2 TREE_CONNECT Response structure. By connecting to a malicious SMB server, a vulnerable Windows client system may crash (BSOD) in mrxsmb20.sys. \nUS-CERT tests confirmed the issue affects Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. A security researcher that goes on Twitter by the handle @PythonResponder , and who disclosed the zero-day's existence, claims it also works against Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2016. Zero-day receives maximum severity score \nThe zero-day has received a CVSS base severity score of 10 out of 10. The score means the issue is easy to weaponize by unskilled attackers and can be exploited remotely. \nThere's no fix from Microsoft for this issue. US-CERT recommends that sysadmins block \"outbound SMB connections (TCP ports 139 and 445 along with UDP ports 137 and 138) from the local network to the WAN.\" \nSMB is an ancient protocol that is used in local networks to allow computers access to files, printers, and serial ports and miscellaneous communications between nodes on a network. \nThere are three versions of this protocol, and Microsoft, through the voice of one of its engineers, has urged system administrators to disable SMBv1 and move to SMBv2 or SMBv3 (preferred). The zero-day affects the latest version, SMBv3. â€” Chris Mallz (@vvalien1) February 1, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:49:09.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
