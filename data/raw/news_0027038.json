Police said the men knew each other and the suspects showed up with an intent of violence. \n“There may have been some longstanding issue between the parties,” Carver said. “Is there some criminality as a potential precursor… possibly.” \nStaff and security intervened and that’s when one of the suspects was seen with a handgun. \n“It must have been terrifying for the people who heard that,” Const. Rob Carver of the Winnipeg Police Service said. “I have seen replica guns. I cannot tell when it’s live and in front of me.” \nSecurity personnel detained the suspects until police arrived. The weapon was determined to be a replica BB/pellet gun. \n“No one in the heat of the moment could know that (it wasn’t real),” Carver said. “We as officers always assume they are real weapons.” \nRyan Boulanger, 28, Jeremy Peltier, 29, and Nathan Scott, 23, have all been changed with three counts of assault along with numerous other charges. \nBoulanger has also been charged with possession of a weapon.
