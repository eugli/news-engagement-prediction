SEE MORE: Awards: The Contenders \nAmong the nominees: “La La Land’s” Emma Stone (who opted for a one-shouldered jumpsuit) and Ryan Gosling, “Jackie” star Natalie Portman (in a casual dress that showed off her growing baby bump, a contrast to the long gowns she’s worn all awards seaon), Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, both in bold prints. Pharrell Williams went ultra casual in a green cap NASA sweatshirt — a nod to his film “Hidden Figures.” \nMatt Damon left his name tag on, but needed no introduction. \nAt the end of the luncheon, the nominees posed for their class portrait. \nThe front row featured the biggest names, including Stone, Damon, Portman and Spencer. On the other side included Mahershala Ali, Ruth Negga and Justin Timberlake. \nHuddled in the fourth row were the petite Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams, costars from Manchester by the Sea. While the statuesque Nicole Kidman and Dev Patel from “Lion” stood in the fifth row. \nCheck out the hi-resolution photo here and video from the shoot below.
