If not, I will kill you.” \nDuterte sent the message to the tax cheats at the launch of Hardin ng Lunas at the Presidential Security Group compound in Malacañang. \n“You pay your taxes and pay it correctly because we need it to run government,” he added. \nDuterte later met with some of the country’s biggest taxpayers, among them business tycoons Manuel V. Pangilinan and Lance Gokongwei, at the kickoff of the tax campaign of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) at the Philippine International Convention Center. \nIn his speech, Duterte assured the business leaders that “there will be no corruption” in his entire six-year term. \nHe said he would never interfere in any government projects as he urged the public to “slap and curse” corrupt public officials who would extort money from them. \n“What you will pay, (as long as it is) accurate, correct (and) on time, the spending will be there for you,” he said. \nBut instead of discussing tax reforms, Duterte spoke about his bloody war on drugs, corruption in the government and his personal ties with some of his Cabinet members. \nIn jest, the President said he had asked Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III what he should tell his audience at the BIR event. \n“Sonny, what should I tell them? You sons of bit**es, pay up or I will kill you?” he said, eliciting laughter from the audience. \n“It’s just a story. Don’t believe it,” he said. “You’re not criminals.” - Philippine Daily Inquirer/Asia News Network <> <>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:44:58.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
