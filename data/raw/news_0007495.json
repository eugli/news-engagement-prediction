and anyone who knows me will say that doesn't sound like me.\"\nThe issue came to a head when she went to university and had to move train carriages seven times because the noise of people eating and rustling papers was unbearable.\n\"When I saw my GP at the time, he laughed at me,\" she said.\n\"Then I tried a counsellor but in my case, that made it worse as it made me even more sensitive to sound.\"\nAfter researching misophonia, she has changed her lifestyle, reducing her caffeine and alcohol intake and uses headphones when visiting the cinema.\nShe said:\"This research is a huge relief as it shows there is a physical basis for misophonia which should help others understand the condition.\n\"It also opens up the opportunity for better management.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:29:33.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
