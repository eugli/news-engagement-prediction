Rec The Golden State Warriors put on one heck of a display in the third quarter of their game against the Los Angeles Clippers , scoring 50 (yes, 50) points. The Warriors trailed 61-49 at the half, with the Clippers understandably feeling pretty good about themselves coming out for the second half of play. But that’s what the Warriors do to you, and the Clippers saw everything in the process. Kevin Durant had 15 of the 50 points for the Warriors, shooting 6-of-7 from the field, including this powerful dunk: Steph Curry put on quite the show himself, scoring 20 points, including 5-of-8 from three-point range. He was making incredibly tough shots look difficult while keeping the Clippers on their toes the entire time. This stepback jumper sent his old teammate Mareesse Speights going the wrong way: Then to close out the quarter, Curry decided he was going to finish the job: A 50-point quarter isn’t complete without a stank face either: The quarter was the 17th 40-point quarter for the Warriors this season, which leads the NBA.

It was the team’s first 50-point quarter since 1989, and also the first 50-point quarter in the NBA in a few years: Golden State's 50-point third quarter is the first in the NBA since the Lakers scored 51 vs. the Knicks on March 25, 2014 — Warriors PR (@WarriorsPR) February 24, 2017 This is what the Warriors have done for the past couple of seasons, hitting teams with demoralizing quarters of flawless basketball.
