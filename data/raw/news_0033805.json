Tasering of child 'unlawful and improper': Court Photo: Three boys were confronted by police at a Bakewell petrol station. (Supplied: Facebook) \nThe boy was a passenger in the stolen car when it pulled into a Bakewell petrol station where police confronted them. \nThe court heard the unarmed 12-year-old was tasered by Sergeant Benjamin Watson from a distance of three metres when he tried to run away. \nThe child pleaded guilty to unlawful use of a vehicle, but not guilty to resisting arrest, escaping custody and driving a motor vehicle while unlicensed. \nThe court heard tasers were not allowed to be used against a young child, as well as near volatile liquids or near a car that might lose control, unless there were exceptional circumstances. \nJudge Fong Lim said there were no extraordinary circumstances that warranted the use of the taser on the boy, especially so close to a petrol bowser. \n\"At the time Watson raised his taser he was aware of these things,\" Judge Fong Lim said. \nShe said there was \"no immediate danger to Watson\" and \"the taser should not have been deployed\". \nJudge Fong Lim ruled the offending of the boy \"was not of a particularly serious nature\" and the \"impropriety of raising the taser [by officer Watson] is great\". \nThe boy, whom the court heard had never been in trouble with police before, received a six-month good behaviour bond. \nThe officer told the Children's Court he was worried the boy would get in another car and be a danger to the public and officers at the scene. \nMs Mitchell said governments should review their guidelines for the use of tasers to support police in apprehending child offenders without the use of tasers. \nThe ABC contacted the NT Police Association but it declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T07:10:03.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
