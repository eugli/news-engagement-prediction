Instead of simply enjoying the rest of the night driving his electric super-car without speed limits, the 41-year-old decided to figure out what was going on. \nHe pulled alongside the car and noticed a motionless body slumped forward, head and arms hanging lifelessly. The driver then made an incredible decision—he chose to stop the car with his own. \nAs the Muenchner Merkur reports, Kick first called the fire department before maneuvering his car in front of the Volkswagen and pumping its brakes. The man braced for impact as the Volkswagen slammed against his precious $70,000 bumper. \n\"For me it was clear that there was no alternative but to slow it down,\" said Kick, according to the Süddeutsche Zeitung . \nAfter a short while, the cars came to a halt, and the man in the Tesla climbed into the passenger seat of the Passat to provide aid. \nA woman and a third driver came to assist his efforts. They were able to stabilize the patient who, according to the Süddeutsche Zeitung , was breathing heavily and was unable to speak. The fire department came soon after, and told local reporters they believe the man, who is now in stable condition, had suffered a stroke. \nBut what about the hero and his Tesla? \nMusk has that covered. The creator himself took to Twitter to let everyone know his company would provide all repair costs free of charge. (The Muenchner Merkur says those costs are around $10,600.) In appreciation, Tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited. https://t.co/D68HNJcCoQ — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 15, 2017 \nWe’ll probably never know whether this is a PR stunt, or a true act of kindness from Musk's heart. Whatever the case may be, Kick’s inspiring actions are a much needed reminder that good deeds don't go unnoticed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T08:27:40.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
