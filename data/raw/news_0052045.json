She had tried to keep it out of her classroom, replacing it with their native language one poster at a time, but the students knew only English.\n“ Milgan ñeok ,” Barbara Parsons said, standing before her class of sixth-graders. White man's words. She brought a hand to her mouth and pretended to pull out the language. She gestured outward.\n“ O’otham ñeok ,” she continued. O'otham words. She tapped the same hand to her lips, pushing in their own language. Putting the words back in. \nBy now the students understood, but offered nothing in response. They were a generation born into English, the children of a people who had lost their native voice. Akimel O’otham had become the language of their grandparents, of old stories and a time when the outside world didn’t feel quite so close.\nThe losses have spread worldwide. Somewhere a language disappears every two weeks, and the last generation of Akimel O’otham speakers on the Gila River Reservation south of Phoenix felt their turn drawing closer. There were maybe 100 speakers left, and, at 53 years old, Parsons was among the youngest.\n“Our young have lost their identity,” Parsons said.\nNow the tribe is frantic to bring it back. The scattered dialects of O'otham have been pulled into a common dictionary. Tribal elders and children meet at weekly practice sessions, trying to link the generations. But traditions die harder. The change had to begin with students, even if it meant spending an entire month at Gila Crossing Community School learning the parts of a tree.\n“ Mo’o ,” Parsons said to a girl now standing at the whiteboard. The assignment was to draw what the class shouted out. Parsons started with a simple word for the upper part of a tree, but the girl didn’t seem to understand.\nThe girl raised a marker and touched it to the board, then lowered it. She thought again, started to draw, and stopped. Nothing came to her.\n“You guys should know all this already,” Parsons said, but the students said it was too hard, that they couldn’t understand the instructions, that there were too many words to remember.\n“Can I go home or something?” a girl in a pink T-shirt asked.\nParsons tried to talk over them, pretending she couldn’t see the headphones that always had their attention, but they were running out of time. The hour-long class was the only O’otham most of the students heard all week. None of the other teachers were speakers. This was their only chance.\n“Your language is dying,” she told them, moving to the front of the small classroom. She dropped her eyes and lowered her voice, pleading for them to understand. Maybe if she could make them care, her people could save the one piece of themselves the world couldn’t steal.\nA language dries up like a river Teacher Arlene Joyce Hughes helps teach the Akimel O'otham language at Gila Crossing Community Schoolon the Gila River Indian Community south of Phoenix.   (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic) \nThe basement door slammed shut, and Arlene Joyce Hughes stood frozen in the dark. She could almost touch all four walls with outstretched arms still sore from being slapped by the teacher’s ruler. The room smelled like mildew. Hughes didn’t know why she was there.\nShe was 7 years old, a first-grader at St. John’s Indian School. She knew just one phrase of English: “My name is Arlene Joyce Hughes.”\nAt home, everything had been O’otham. Her parents spoke English only at the grocery store or when the peddler came to their house, and Hughes rarely left the village. But the American government believed that civilized life demanded English, and students were punished for speaking their native language.\nSo she stopped talking. “I shut down when I couldn’t speak right,” she said many years later. Slowly she became an English speaker, joining a generation of people who had been torn from their culture.\nNative languages around the world are fading into history, smothered by a handful of dominant tongues and the ever-growing reach of technology. Expanding cities press against shrinking tribal lands, closing the distance between tradition and the modern world. The outside world almost always wins. Half the world’s languages are expected to vanish by the end of the century.\nIn Indonesia, just one man speaks Taje. A man in northern Australia is scrambling to document Amurdag before he dies. And Akimel O’otham isn’t even the most endangered language on the Gila River Reservation, where two tribes live: the Akimel O'otham and the Maricopa. In the community's District 7, home to Maricopa people, about 15 people speak Pee-Posh.\nWhen a language dies, it takes with it an entire worldview. Akimel O’otham has no word to give thanks, or to say goodbye. But it is intimately connected with the Gila River, a place where mountains cast long shadows and months are named for the trees they produce. Even the tribe itself is named for nature: Akimel O’otham. River People.\nDescended from the Huhugam, the O'otham tribe has always flowed from the Gila River, which fed fertile farms as it cut through the desert. The tribe’s home once stretched well past Phoenix, but as outsiders claimed the land for themselves, the people clung to the water. War came, then famine and drought, and the O’otham drew more tightly to the life-giving Gila.\nThe river has long since dried up.\nRELATED: In Colombia, Palenque's native tongue went from a dying language to a living treasure \n'What you are doing is good' Mariah Percy-Osife, 13, enjoys a moment in class learning the Akimel O'otham language at Gila Crossing Community School on the Gila River Indian Community south of Phoenix.   (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic) \n“Don’t tell anybody what you know,” Hughes’ father always told her, desperate to protect their culture from outsiders. \"This is who we are. It belongs to us.\"\nThey had lived one way for centuries, passing on the tribe's stories, the language. And what had that secrecy created? She was 59 years old now and had spent a lifetime watching her culture blend into the rest of the world.\nAkimel O’otham was spiraling toward extinction. So she helped start a movement to save it.\nThe local school’s culture teacher lived next door, and Hughes joined the classes in 1999. She was named Culture and Language Teacher a year later. News of classes in O’otham and tribal traditions spread through the community, and soon people were bringing Hughes written work of their own. They brought oral histories. They brought hymns and other songs. They brought glossaries of common words, with definitions given in sketches.\nShe hired an apprentice who could pronounce the words and spent evenings working alongside him, translating what he read into English. During the day she studied education at Arizona State, then enrolled at the American Indian Language Development Institute at the University of Arizona.\nBack home, Parsons and Luis Barragan, a linguist who specialized in documenting and revitalizing native languages, held weekly practice sessions at the community center. Barragan was an outsider who ran the tribe's culture museum and learned O’otham as a third language. A few dozen people came to the sessions each week.\nA curriculum began to take shape, but one basic problem remained. People scattered across the Gila River community’s seven districts spoke their own dialects of O’otham, with altered spellings and distinct vocabularies. There was no unified dictionary. Saving one language would be difficult, let alone one for each region.\nGila River’s governor ordered the schools to settle on a common alphabet and writing system and formed a committee to create them. With a handful of cultural leaders, Hughes traveled across the reservation for public meetings in each district. People brought their writings, their dialects and their concerns. Hughes remembers one of the meetings.\n“Why should we revive a language when it is not going to be used?” one elder asked.\n“What if we should have another war?” asked another. Simplifying and documenting their language, he worried, would allow enemies to understand their messages.\nDuring the year of discussion, Hughes held a meeting at Gila River’s Elderly Center. One elderly man sat in the back of the room, content to sit silently and listen. Twenty minutes passed. He had said nothing until he cleared his throat, crossing his legs as the room turned toward him.\n“What you are doing is good,” he said in O’otham. “It doesn’t matter who writes it. As long as you have it, it will not change.”\nThe Gila River Tribal Council approved the Akimel O’otham Orthography in 2009 by a unanimous vote.\nGila Crossing hired Hughes last year and asked her to guide its language classes. The school’s longtime O’otham teacher, Sharon Shelde, needed somebody to expand the curriculum and oversee students’ progress.\nDaily attendance at Gila Crossing, in the village of Komatke, had swelled past what the old concrete building could hold, so the clearing behind it had been filled with trailers and free-standing classrooms. Culture and Language was in Room 512, a meager, stand-alone room with low ceilings and homemade posters in O’otham on the wall. Half the students couldn’t read English and just a few more passed math, but every student took O’otham classes.\nThe idea had worked: Younger children had started to ask their grandparents to practice, and a few greeted Hughes in O’otham when they met at the store. It had become a movement, a tribe of people holding off the outside world as time ran out.\nBut time, like the outside world, always wins. Three days before Hughes started at Gila Crossing, Ms. Shelde died.\n“We went so far,” Hughes said, shaking her head, “and it flatlined.”\nJust sleeping in there Teacher Barbara Parsons, left, watches Marisol Soke, 15, write a word on the board while learning the Akimel O'otham language at Gila Crossing Community School.   (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic) \nThe students’ disrespect frustrated her, so Tammy Histia left the school and went to find water. Rain had finally come. Maybe she could see the river rise again.\n\n“There should be something here,” she said, driving over dust-swept roads that led away from the school. Country music played over the radio. She drove past an abandoned church and out of the village of Komatke, where some families lived in mud-walled homes without running water.\nHistia, the tribe’s assistant culture coordinator, learned Akimel O’otham as a second language. Born off the reservation, she moved to Gila River during the transition, when her O’otham-speaking grandparents would fall silent around her. They wanted her future to be in English.\nAs an adult she moved and traveled, but nothing felt like home. She missed the desert, the way the wind swept across empty spaces. She missed how the dirt tasted.\nShe had seen people leave home, determined life would be better somewhere else. But they almost always came back. Most tried to relearn O’otham, and she brought them to her Thursday-night classes.\nPhoenix used to be a foreign place. The city was an hour away and people on the Gila River left it there, except for occasional trips to the store or a special weekend visit to family who had moved away. It remained part of a separate world, with its fast pace and technology and English.\nBut the city kept growing, eating up more of the desert until it couldn’t be kept out. Now it was 20 minutes to the mall.\n“The outside world just came one day and decided to be there,” she said. “We’re still trying to catch up.”\nThe people of Gila River took pride in their patience. They refused to be changed by the world that pushed against them, or by the people who sliced their land in half and took their children to boarding schools, but eventually they could resist no more. The community had splintered across the generations: The tribe’s elders grew up in wagons, hauling water back to their homes, and their grandchildren kept asking why there were no iPhone apps in O’otham.\nTo hold off the modern culture seeping into theirs, they created new words, holding meetings to decide what to call cereal, computers and telephones. Television, they decided, would be called jiavul wi. Devil’s eye.\nBut it didn’t feel the same. Soon, Histia warned children, they would be no different from the world. Language was all that held them together.\n“It’s just sleeping in there,” Histia liked to say. She wanted to believe O’otham could be saved, but only if the children cared. “I see a lot of kids grasping at it, wanting it.”\nHow, she kept asking, could they claim to be O’otham without talking like one?\nShe drove until the roads stopped and the path filled with rocks. She could see no water.\n“Still dry,” she said, turning the car back toward home.\n'This is a cup' Barbara Parsons teaches the Akimel O'otham language at Gila Crossing Community School.   (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic) \nA language must leave the classroom to live, so Parsons, Hughes and Barragan took O’otham into the villages. On a Wednesday night they filled the District 6 Learning Center with playhouse props, and people came for two hours of unbroken immersion.\nGrandparents came to show their children it was important, and grandchildren came to show off to their elders. One man said he just wanted something to do on a cold, lonely night. As the last of 25 people opened folding chairs onto the beige tile floors, Barragan and Parsons stood in front of a cardboard cabinet stuffed with kitchenware.\n“We know some of you guys are kind of returning,” Barragan said. The group hadn’t met since before the holidays. “So we’ll start off with a little review.”\nHe turned to the cabinet and pulled out a red plastic cup.\n“ Sha’chud i:tha? ” he asked Parsons. What is this? \n“ Hegai o wud ko:ba ,” she responded. This is a cup . She pointed at a man to her left and he repeated it, slowly. One after another, the rest of the group followed.\nWhen everybody had identified the cup, Barragan set it down and picked up a plastic knife. He held it high, mock confusion on his face, and repeated the question. “ Sha’chud i:tha? ”\nThey continued for almost an hour, Barragan and Parsons pretending not to recognize kitchen items until students young and old reminded them, choosing to ignore that a white man who spoke O’otham as a third language was now their main source of knowledge.\n“ Sha’chud i:tha ?” Barragan asked again, and the circle of people answered in unison. He had orange juice. He had forks. He had salt, milk, a stack of plates that he left upside-down in the cabinet. He finally had their attention, and they had a little trouble understanding.\nIn a side room, Hughes led a smaller group through the vocabulary of driving: keys, wallet, hospital, school.\n“It may get kind of boring in a bit, but it’s just repetition over and over and over again,” Barragan told his group. “That’s the only way to learn O’otham.”\nSome answers came easily. The O’otham word for coffee, for example, sounds remarkably like its English counterpart.\nA little girl knew them all. She shouted out each answer in an instant. “ Ha’o! ” the group cheered each time, sending her into hiding behind her grandfather, who struggled to keep up with the 5-year-old.\nThe group broke for cookies, then sat in a circle for a round of games. Darkness fell. People leaving a computer room stopped to look through the unlocked glass door, but nobody came in. For two hours the group was surrounded by O’otham, and the world stayed outside.\n“ O’otham ñeok ,” Parsons said again, tapping that same hand to her lips, and for once they understood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:08:51.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
