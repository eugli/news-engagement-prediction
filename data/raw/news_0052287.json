Chef/owner Junya Watanabe , who launched the wildly popular Rakiraki Ramen and Pokirrito in Kearny Mesa and Little Italy, is bringing another trendy Japanese concept to San Diego. Watanabe was originally going to open a yakitori shop in the space next to RakiRaki on Convoy Street, but has since switched gears to focus on temaki, or sushi hand rolls that feature a cone-shaped piece of seaweed wrapped around rice and a variety of ingredients. Scheduled to open this spring, j/wata Temaki Bar will specialize exclusively in these hand-held rolls that will be filled with locally-sourced fish, specially harvested seaweed, house crafted sauces, and the chef’s signature sushi rice. Premium menu items will range from flame-blistered Japanese eel and prime sirloin to grilled marinated black cod with miso and sea urchin. Courtesy rendering Design OPERA, Inc. The 1,500-square-foot space is being designed by Design OPERA, Inc. and brought to life by One of a Kind Company , who recently worked on Pali Wine Co. in Little Italy and the Gaslamp’s new Monkey King. The eatery’s 22 seats will ring a central sushi bar, with a modern and minimalist palette of grey, black, natural woods and stainless steel and some playful elements inspired by Tokyo’s iconic fish markets. 4646 Convoy Street #103, San Diego, CA 92111 More From Eater San Diego", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:14:27.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
