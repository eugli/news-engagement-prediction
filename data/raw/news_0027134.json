Responding to a formal complaint launched by legal experts late last year, the provincial watchdog said the Ministry of Labour “has been studying this issue and is currently looking at options” to address what critics call discriminatory mental health policies at the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board . \nOnly employees who sustain mental stress injuries as a result of a “sudden” traumatic event in the workplace are currently entitled to receive benefits under existing legislation. But the vast majority of workers who develop psychological conditions from long-term workplace issues do not have the right to compensation. \n“The deputy minister … advised that the ministry anticipates that it will receive some government direction within the next few months on this issue,” the director of the ombudsman’s special response team, Gareth Jones, said in a letter obtained by the Star.\nThe letter says the watchdog is intended as a body of last resort although it adds that the complaint could be re-examined once “all other efforts to resolve an issue have been exhausted.”\n  But the complainants, who include Toronto-based legal clinics and the former chair of the WSIB’s own independent appeals tribunal, say they are frustrated with “the clear history of this government’s persistent foot-dragging on this issue.” \nMore than two years ago, the board’s appeals tribunal ruled that the policy violated the constitutional right to equality of an injured worker who had appealed a decision to deny her benefits for a chronic mental stress. Two subsequent rulings on separate appeals in 2015 and 2016 reached the same conclusion. \nBut tribunal rulings are only binding in the specific cases before them. So in the absence of legislative change, workers are forced to launch lengthy legal battles to win their entitlements.\nThe Ontario government did amend the legislation in question last year, making it easier for first-responders like police officers to claim compensation for post-traumatic stress disorders. But it did not address the loophole that excludes other workers with chronic mental stress from benefits. \n“Workers’ advocates have heard these vague government reassurances about pending changes to this chronic stress legislation before, but nothing has come of them,” the complainants, who demanded a formal investigation into the matter in November, told the ombudsman.\nIn a statement to the Star, Michael Speers, a Labour minister spokesperson, said the government was “committed to treating all injured workers with the fairness, dignity and respect they deserve, and to providing them with the help they need when they need it.”\n“We are listening to the concerns being raised regarding this issue,” he added. “While we cannot comment on decisions made by the ombudsman, we are currently examining options to address the issue of mental stress.‎\nLaura Lunansky, a lawyer for the Injured Workers’ Consultants Community Legal Clinic, said she was not yet aware of injured worker advocates being consulted on potential reforms. \n“Part of the issue is, how long are we expected to wait?” she said. \nHer client, 57-year-old Margery Wardle, is appealing the WSIB’s decision to deny her compensation for mental health issues stemming from what she calls “the culmination of years and years of workplace sexual harassment.”\nWardle, a former heavy equipment operator who now works for the Ontario Network of Injured Workers Groups, said she was subject to a range of distressing behaviours in her male-dominated workplace, including pornographic pictures being deliberately placed around women’s time cards and on their desks.\n“I was spat at, I was grabbed from behind, sexualized jokes would be made in our presence, very foul sexualized language in our presence,” Wardle said. \nShe says a psychiatrist advised she should not return to work after she was swarmed and threatened by two male colleagues who she says called her “a g", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:40:49.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
