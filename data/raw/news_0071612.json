King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 5 hours ago 6 \nMetallica recently shared a video highlighting their superfan Doug Brown from Toronto and his massive collection of all things 'Tallica. \nAs you can see in the clip below, Doug owns 850 variations of the band's vinyl and CD releases, along with up to 3,000 other memorabilia goodies. \nMr. Brown explained: \"I started collecting at a very young age, my coursing got me a copy of the ' Black Album ' on cassette for my 8th birthday. I was interested in the music so much I wanted cassette singles and I started finding part-time jobs just so I could start buying more things. \n\"When I was in high school, I was working at a library and every penny - I would just go to HMV and buy import CDs.\" \nSaying how the whole thing was quick to \"spiral out of control,\" the collector added: \"When the eBay factor came into play, I realized I could get promos and I started getting every single country of origin possible. The internet's an amazing resource for stuff like this. ... If an album is released, I'll go buy 50 copies of it and ship it to 50 different people all around the world and they will ship me different pressings from their countries. We've been doing this for 15 years now.\" \nSingling out some of the top items in his collection, Doug said: \"I have a series of very rare test pressings, I have some uncut clear picture discs of ' Jump in the Fire ' both with and without barcode, couple early Cliff Burton autographs, a fully autographed version of ' Master of Puppets '...\" \nHe concluded: \"There really is no end goal and I hope there will be no end goal. That's one thing that's common between all types of collectors. People who collect stamps and coins - if you got 'em all, you'll probably start collecting something else. So at one point, I'll probably want every single version of ' Kill 'Em All ' on vinyl. Once I hit 65 vinyls of 'Kill 'Em All,' I realized I'm never gonna get them all!\" \nThe band stated: \"We met Doug before the gig at the Opera House in Toronto and were blown away by his Metallica collection. Check out the story of this collector.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:44:04.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
