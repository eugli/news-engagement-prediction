The 29-year-old boasts 6 million followers on Instagram, her own clothing line, and 220 pounds, which means she weighs two times more than the average Japanese woman.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below カメラさんはどんな気持ちでシャッターを押したのか気になる写真。 足短。 動物を撮る気持ちで撮ったのかな？ 野生のトドの撮影に成功。みたいなさ。 人間だよ。 I wonder how the cameraman was feeling when taking this photo. My legs are too short. I wonder if he felt like he was shooting an animal. Probably like, \"yey, captured a wild sea lion!\" Um... nope, I'm human. #トド #野生 #撮影 #成功 #ibiza\nA post shared by 渡辺直美 (@watanabenaomi703) on Aug 25, 2015 at 1:11am PDT\nJapan has long upheld certain ideas about what the female body should look like, Watanabe told the Washington Post . Obesity levels are low (only 3 percent of Japanese women are obese, compared to 34.9 percent in the United States), but the spread of sometimes unrealistic cultural ideals means there are also many Japanese women who are unhealthily — and, in some cases, dangerously — skinny. According to government health data, 22 percent of Japanese women are underweight or malnourished.\nさっきの写真あまりにも吉村さんがキモいキモいになったので可愛いワンちゃんの写真に変えますw 吉村さん見たら泣くやつw @hnkyoshimura #確かにキモかったごめんね #でも素敵なおじさんだからね許してね #二の腕ターキー1羽分の大きさ #台湾にて #今からワールドツアーの記者会見ですワクドキ #今日のラジオも聴いてね\nA post shared by 渡辺直美 (@watanabenaomi703) on Sep 15, 2016 at 1:32am PDT\nIt's this lack of plus-size representation that pushes Watanabe to use her platform to spread body positivity in Japan. But she doesn't care much for trying to change other people's opinion of her — instead, she simply wants to show the bigger-than-average women in her country that they're just as strong and valuable as the smaller women who surround them.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below \"Japan is not like the U.S. You don't see many plus-sized women around here,\" she told the Post. \"But rather than trying to change other people's minds, I would like to help change the minds of bigger women, to help them feel good about themselves.\"\nLast 台湾です。今回はいつも以上に最高に楽しい撮影でした。 ありがとう台湾、ありがとう台南。 またね！ なんか沢山台湾行ってるよね？って思っているそこのあなた！ 実は私の台湾本第2弾を製作中です。 発売日が決まったら発表いたします。 #わんちゃんの名前はお米 #台南 #台湾 #撮影中 #お米いい子 #ドライバーヨウさんのお友達のわんちゃん #ヨウさんyoyoッ #って近づくとyoyo言ってくれるw #優しいヨウさんもありがとう\nA post shared by 渡辺直美 (@watanabenaomi703) on Jun 15, 2016 at 1:16am PDT\nAnd that's exactly what she does. Since 2013, the comedian has acted as a regular cover girl for a plus-size magazine that hopes to de-stigmatize \"pochari,\" or \"marshmallow girls.\" She talks openly about her size on Instagram, and was named one of Vogue Japan's Women of the Year in 2016. Perhaps her biggest claim to big-girl fame, though, is her clothing line, which she started in 2014. It's called Punyus (a play on the Japanese word for \"squishy\" or \"bouncy\"), and it offers fashionable options to larger girls across the country.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below 台湾の花蓮に来てます。 クソ暑いが綺麗だ。 台湾本第2弾皆様お楽しみに。 #台湾でもしっかりモテない #凄い見てくるがそれはパンダを見る時と同じ目 #という事で来月の台湾撮影で合コンする事になりました #人生初合コンin台湾 #人見知りパンダで終わらないように #TAIWAN #六十石山金針花海\nA post shared by 渡辺直美 (@watanabenaomi703) on Aug 22, 2016 at 11:55pm PDT\nNow a social media sensation in Japan, Watanabe tells the Post that women will comment on her Instagram photos or even approach her in the streets to thank her for being a voice for plus-size women and for providing them with clothing that truly makes them feel cool . It's these women — women who not only reject the traditional Japanese idea that women are meant to be seen and not heard, but who are also confident in their curves — who inspire Watanabe to keep being the role model that she's become.\nIBIZA 海綺麗💗 So... this hot guy on the boat started talking to me in Spanish, and I totally thought he was hitting on me. I gave him a smile only to find out that he just wanted to tell me I had lipstick on my teeth. I checked the mirror and saw that I had a shit ton of lipstick, as if I had eaten one stick whole, smeared on my front teeth. I just jumped straight into the ocean. #SeaLion #紅の豚 #紅のトド #PorcoRosso #IBIZA #ボートのイケメンのお兄さんに #スペイン語で話しかけられて #口説いてると思ってニヤニヤして近づいたら #歯紅してるよ #とただ注意されただけだった #鏡見たら口紅食べたんじゃないかってくらい #前歯にべっとり付いてた #そのまま海に飛び込んだ #恥ずかしイビサ\nA post shared by 渡辺直美 (@watanabenaomi703) on Jun 5, 2015 at 12:32am PDT\n\"Japanese women are changing, and there are loads more women who can express themselves and many fewer women who just say yes to everything like before,\" she told the Post. \"I see more women becoming super-strong and confident, and it helps me grow, too.\"\nFrom: Dr. Oz The Good Life\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": ["http://www.drozthegoodlife.com/fitness/tips/g286/plus-size-fitness-brands/", "http://www.drozthegoodlife.com/healthy-lifestyle/body/news/a3128/fashion-blogger-honeymoon-body-shaming/", "http://www.drozthegoodlife.com/healthy-lifestyle/body/news/a2099/ashley-graham-body-shaming-essay/", "http://www.drozthegoodlife.com/healthy-lifestyle/body/g785/ashley-graham-swimsuits-for-all-sports-illustrated-2017/", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-super-skinny-japannaomi-watanabe-is-chubby-and-proud/2017/02/07/692023a1-7cd2-46fd-8e78-f25fa711d214_story.html?utm_term=.459abd60a42b", "http://www.drozthegoodlife.com/healthy-lifestyle/body/news/a2625/80-year-old-model-wang-deshun/", "http://www.drozthegoodlife.com/healthy-lifestyle/body/news/a3213/chrissy-metz-depression-weight-loss/", "http://www.drozthegoodlife.com/healthy-lifestyle/body/news/a3284/naomi-watanabe-body-positivity-japan/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BGqwiVgmMa1/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/6zJdaWmMfK/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/3ighMGGMQG/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BKXrglVAEZB/", "http://www.drozthegoodlife.com/healthy-lifestyle/body/news/a2362/average-american-womans-size/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BJcSHUTgAI0/", "http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/ncd/risk_factors/obesity/atlas.html", "http://www.drozthegoodlife.com/healthy-lifestyle/body/news/a3015/body-positive-dance-videos/"], "published": "2017-02-14T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:51:20.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
