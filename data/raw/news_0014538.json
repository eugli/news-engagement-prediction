(Gabriel Olsen/Getty Images) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — The American Humane organization says a third-party investigation prompted by leaked video from the set of “A Dog’s Purpose” found no animal injuries occurred during those scenes. \nThe investigation followed release of the video that appeared to show a frightened German shepherd being forced into churning water. \nAmerican Humane said Friday that an independent animal-cruelty expert concluded that preventative safety measures were in place. The group also said that the leaked video was deliberately edited to mislead the public. \nAmerican Humane, which had an animal safety representative on the set, did say the dog’s signs of stress should have been recognized earlier. \n“A Dog’s Purpose,” starring Dennis Quaid and featuring the voice of Josh Gad, opened in second place at the box office last weekend. \nPETA called for a boycott of the film, while the studio and filmmakers canceled its press junket and premiere but still proceeded with releasing the film in over 3,000 locations as planned. \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
