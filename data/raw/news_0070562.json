The index is once again headed higher in Thursday trading. \nBut as Wall Street pros often say, stocks never go up in a straight line, at least not for long periods of time. In the Dow’s case, its longest daily winning streak is 14 trading days, a feat accomplished 120 years ago in 1897, in year two of its existence, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. \nOptimism is on the rise as investors cheer better economic numbers and corporate profits. A second tailwind is Wall Street’s big bet that the country’s business fortunes will improve further if President Trump is able to implement his economic agenda. Trump, of course, is pushing for big tax cuts for corporations, less business regulation and large spending on infrastructure projects. Those planned moves are viewed by Wall Street as growth-friendly. Porsche, Lexus, Toyota top J.D. Power dependability study \n“The market is saying all this stuff is going to happen, all this stuff is going to work, all this stuff is going to be good for the economy, so why would I sell now,” explains Lamar Villere, co-manager of the Villere Balanced Fund. \nBut Wall Street’s rosy view of things is also one of the big risks facing the market, he adds. \n“The first time one of Trump’s major economic policy platforms gets shut down by Congress, you might get the market to say, “Hmm, maybe this won’t happen. The market could start to get shaky. You could have a pullback, as it would remove one of the main reasons for the rally.” \nOther surprises that could roil the market include: \nUnexpected shocks. Investors should “expect the unexpected,’ says Peter Donisanu, global research analyst for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \nSuch tail risks, or Black Swan events, could come from abroad. Upcoming elections in places like France, the Netherlands and Germany could inject fresh political risk into the market equation if the populist movement seen in the Brexit vote last June and in the U.S. presidential election in November gains momentum in Europe with fresh victories. Greece’s mounting debt load will also return to the news as it looks to renegotiate again with its creditors. \nToo much complacency. Investor fear is low. Complacency is high. That’s a bad combination, says Peter Cardillo, chief market strategist at First Standard Financial Company. \nToo many investors are piled into the same trades and the same stocks. “They’re overly enthusiastic,” says Cardillo. “Everything is rosy now. At some point this market could trip over itself and suffer a healthy correction” or decline of 5% or more. \nAn unfriendly Fed. No one expects the Federal Reserve to kill off the bull market by ramping up interest rates too high, too quickly and with too little warning for Wall Street. But never say never. \n“The only thing the Fed could do to really cause problems in the market would be to (engineer) a sharp, unexpected increase in rates, but I don’t see that,” says Villere. \nA turn in economic data. The other potential negative that could derail the current stock market exuberance would be if economic data started to come in soft, calling into question the bullish thesis that the economy is getting stronger, adds Donisanu. \n“Investors might start questioning why they are paying so much for stocks, and question the high valuations,” he says.
