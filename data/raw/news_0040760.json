The first two or three months weren't great but they've turned it around. There's a way of playing that the fans are enjoying.\nThe only problem is they're still sixth, which after being in such good form is a bit of a worry. But I watch them now and have no doubt they'll finish in the top four.\nThey're playing the best out of the top six with Chelsea and you have to fancy them to finish second or third. Probably third if I had to nail it down.\nPaul Scholes sat down with Sportsmail to discuss the state of play at Manchester United\nScholes is convinced that former team-mate Wayne Rooney won't want to be a substitute\nThe ex-midfielder has backed Jose Mourinho to restore United to greatness\nSo who are your top four?\nChelsea, City, United and then it's between Arsenal and Liverpool.\nYou said United lacked an identity under louis Van Gaal and were boring...\nI wasn't the only one! I didn't say Van Gaal was a bad manager but his style of play wasn't suited to Man United. His sole thing was keeping possession of the ball and United fans just get bored of that.\nIt's something Van Gaal couldn't get out of his head. Mourinho came in and knew what the fans expected of his team. He's certainly tried to do that and since October they've looked like a Man United team that wants to score goals.\nThey're creating more than enough chances — 20-odd a game or something — but the conversion rate needs to improve. If it had been anything like decent, they would have been up there challenging Chelsea.\nThey rely too heavily on Zlatan Ibrahimovic. He's been a great signing but there hasn't been someone there to chip in with goals and take the pressure off him.\nDo you find it difficult being critical of United?\nIt's horrible. The last thing I want to do is upset anybody at the club, but you just try to be honest. I don't care whether it's Man United, Chelsea or Arsenal, I'll say what I think.\nI'm not bothered about upsetting fans and officials of other clubs but when it's your own club it's really difficult. The last couple of years, when I was going into United games I thought, 'Jeez, here we go again!'\nNow I really look forward to it because I know there are better players, a better playing style, and I know there's a chance of enjoying the game.\nScholes looks out over Old Trafford during his interview with Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler\nHe revealed that he never met ex-United boss Louis van Gaal, of whom he was highly critical\nDid you ever meet Van Gaal?\nNo, I don't think he wanted to meet me somehow.\nYou said you wouldn't want to play for United under Van Gaal. What about Mourinho?\nYes, definitely. There is a speed and desire to score goals which win games.\nIs he the right fit?\nHe has the stature to be United manager, the reputation and presence. I just wish it had happened three years ago!\nThere was concern among my mates who are United fans. Can we cope with his histrionics at other clubs? He also had a reputation for being there two or three years then going.\nThere were worrying signs. He was sent off twice and had a bit of a go at Chris Smalling and Luke Shaw in public.\nBut since then it's been totally different. He's been very impressive.\nCan you see signs of United's DNA again?\nYes. It was difficult at the start, but Mourinho can change his style of football. He was quite defensive at Chelsea but there was no DNA there.\nHe's come to a club where fans and people expect a certain way of playing and it wasn't adhered to for the last two years. He understood that he needed to give the fans what they wanted.\nScholes believes he has seen signs of the Manchester United of old starting to return\nHas he altered his natural style to please United fans?\nYes. Mourinho is getting all aspects of it right. They are a difficult team to play against, as well as a good team to play for. I still have my doubts when they play the top teams. Is the back four good enough against proper forwards like Sergio Aguero, Alexis Sanchez and Harry Kane?\nHave Ibrahimovic and Pogba brought some star quality back?\nDefinitely. They're big signings. Henrikh Mkhitaryan as well. The signings in previous years weren't good enough. Van Gaal signed players who didn't have enough character or presence to play at this club.\nWe knew what stars Pogba, Ibrahimovic and Mkhitaryan were. They've all played at massive clubs and were ready-made special players. It was what was needed. It's no surprise how well Zlatan has done, although he would have struggled in a Van Gaal team.\nHe says Mourinho 'is getting all aspects right' when it comes to the style of his United side\nWhat would be a good season from this point?\nDefinitely finish in the top four. This time last year I would have said that was still a failure. But from what he's had to rebuild, a top-four finish would be acceptable.\nWinning two of the three cup competitions would be very good and constitute a really good season. Next year will be a totally different ball game. He has to challenge for the league.\nHow important is it to reach the last 16 of the Europa League?\nThis year with a top-four place not guaranteed, winning this competition is massive because it's a way into the Champions League.\nThere are still some decent teams in it but the way United are playing now they're favourites to win it.\nWhat do they need this summer to go up a level?\nThey're only a couple of players away. I would bring in a controlling midfield player.\nA centre forward to help Ibrahimovic. (Antoine) Griezmann — or (Sergio) Aguero wouldn't be bad!\nWe'll have to see defensively when they play Tottenham, City, Chelsea and Arsenal. That will determine whether he needs a centre half. Right back, left back not a problem. Goalkeeper not a problem, unless Real Madrid want him (David de Gea).\nScholes believes United are 'only a couple of players away' from being a real force\nSUPER STAT Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes won 11 trophies in their nine years together at Old Trafford, including five Premier League titles and one Champions League.\nHow do you see the Wayne Rooney situation ending?\nIt's a strange one. No one will be more frustrated than Wayne at not playing. Being a sub will be driving him up the wall. When he gets his chance he has to take it because he has real competition.\nHe's injured for Thursday's game. Will it have hurt him being on the fringes this season?\nIt will be killing him just coming in for the Europa League or the FA Cup. But it's up to him to get his head down and prove he can play in the big games.\nCan you see Rooney staying for two more years?\nIf it carries on going the way it is, I can't. Maybe it will be re-assessed at the end of the season if he's in and out of the team. I don't see him as a player who will accept that. He will want to be at a team where he's playing every week.\nScholes cannot see Rooney carrying on for two more years as a bit-part player for United\nHas Ibrahimovic had a negative impact on Martial and Rashford?\nI don't think so. It will be a great education playing with someone like that. I don't see Martial as a centre forward anyway.\nHe doesn't have the cleverness to be a centre forward for United but as a left winger he could be one of the best in the world. Ibrahimovic isn't stopping him developing.\nMaybe more so with Marcus, but he's 19 and better coming into games at the moment on the left or right-hand side.\nHe should be watching Ibrahimovic every day in training. I'm sure he's capable of taking over that role one day.\nHaving Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the squad will educate United's players, says Scholes\nLosing the No 9 upset Martial. Do players really care?\nSome players care about it, others don't. I wouldn't have cared one bit about numbers. I can imagine David Beckham being unhappy about taking the No 7 off him, or Cristiano Ronaldo. If Zlatan wasn't No 9, I don't think he'd be too happy about it. Martial did seem to be in a sulk but he seems to have got over it.\nRio Ferdinand was critical of Pogba and Lingard posting a goal celebration on social media with the team in sixth place...\nThat's the way it's changed. It would never even have been attempted under Alex Ferguson. When we were growing up, the first-team dressing-room was a sacred place. You had to knock on the door. Even the manager did.\nI remember after a European night here, [former United defender] Alex Buttner took a picture in the dressing room and put it on Instagram or Twitter. The manager went ballistic.\nNow you're seeing stuff posted on social media. It's all down to the manager. If he says they can do that then good luck to them. Whether he's had a go at them behind closed doors, I don't know.\nYou can see where Rio was coming from but in this day and age you probably have to be a bit more relaxed. The thing with Pogba, he's got more celebrations than goals. We want to see celebrations but when he's scoring a goal.\nScholes says United midfielder Paul Pogba has 'got more celebrations than goals'\nCan that affect the progress of a young player?\nIt can do. But the Pogba I know, I don't think that would get in the way of his football. He's very focused and professional in the way he goes about his training. I don't think this type of thing will get to him or affect his performance.\nIt's going on with every player — none more so than (Lionel) Messi and Ronaldo, and you see how they perform every week. He does need to concentrate on his football. But as long as that's the first thing in his mind, the rest will come.\nl Paul Scholes was speaking on behalf of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, an official partner of the UEFA Europa League.
