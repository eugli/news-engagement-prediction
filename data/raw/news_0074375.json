The Guardian reported earlier in the month how Ranieri was facing growing unrest not only from players but the club’s staff as Leicester’s Premier League campaign descended into a fight against relegation. Leicester’s present dangers made Claudio Ranieri’s past glories irrelevant | Paul Wilson Read more \nKlopp takes his Liverpool team to Leicester on Monday aiming to capitalise on the problems at the King Power Stadium but unconvinced by claims that player power got Ranieri the sack. The Liverpool manager insists players held more sway during his playing days and what really undermines a manager is an owner, director or executive who holds court with the dressing room. \n“Players are not more powerful, we were much more powerful as players in the past,” Klopp said. “It depends always on the board and if there is a direct way to the board. If the owners sit with the players and ask ‘How are you?’ and they will say ‘Not too good’ then it is ‘Why?’ ‘Because of the manager.’ I have never had this situation where there is a direct line to the owner or whatever. As long as the players talk together there is no problem. If they start talking about you? For this you need an ear on the other side. \n“It is not about how powerful. The players need to be powerful but not in sacking managers. They never did it. It’s not like the Leicester players did it or something. Someone asked and they gave an answer.” \nKlopp had seven-year spells as manager at both Mainz and Borussia Dortmund and, while success undoubtedly enabled him to leave the two clubs on his own terms, he believes a respectful working relationship with players ensured he has never been sacked. “I don’t know if it’s weakness [when a board contacts players] but it’s the situation,” he said. “I never had it but I know it has happened. \n“To maintain the relationship, it’s not like we come together every day and hug each other. We enjoy the work. I know what they want, they know what I want, so it is very good information. We’ve had some nice moments already and hard moments already and in the hard moments nothing came between us, not in the whole of January. Absolutely nothing. I did not say: ‘How can I win if they don’t deliver?’ because I didn’t think it. And they didn’t say they could win if only I said the right things, because they didn’t think it.

It is all full of respect. As long as they work really hard I am a really nice person. Not always in training, but I always respect. I will then decide who will start. If they start not working – and that does not mean running it means concentrating on what you need to play football, listening – then I am not a nice guy actually, but none of the players expect me to let them do what they want. They know someone has to make the rules and it is long ago I made them, and now we have to respect them.” \nJordan Henderson, the Liverpool captain, summonsed a team meeting before the recent Premier League win against Tottenham Hotspur in response to a damaging run of one win in 10 games. It was a move welcomed by Klopp, who could be without Dejan Lovren and Daniel Sturridge against Leicester due to a knee injury and illness respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:50:49.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
