But he’s an Everton supporter and I think they are now in a position where they could take it on [a deal for Rooney]. Wayne is still incredibly close to the club.” \nM oyes knows that Rooney will be struggling to come to terms with his impending departure from United, but feels he has made the right decision to wait until the end of the season to assess his options rather than sign for a Chinese club next week. \n“Every player comes to the end of their time,” Moyes added. “And at Man United, it is part of the job as manager to get rid of good players, to keep the club at where it wants to be, those big decisions must be made. \n“Wayne has been in the spotlight since he was 16 - he’s had a lot of coverage and been followed everywhere, some of it good, some of it bad. Whatever he decides will be for the best of him and his family. \n“He’s 31 and has had a brilliant career, but I think he could play on and on, if he wants to. His body is robust enough to take it.” Follow Telegraph Football", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:52:47.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
