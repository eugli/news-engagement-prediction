Lots of love, North and Saint.\" Too cute for words, right? Photos \nChrissy Teigen & John Legend's Daughter Luna's Baby Album \nSo what did the Wests give to Luna on her very first Valentine's Day? Why, none other than a pair of teensy tiny baby Yeezys, of course! \nLuna looked in awe of the fancy footwear and, truth be told, seemed to like her brand new kicks. \nAnd while we still have to wait until tomorrow to see exactly how Chrissy and John celebrate their bundle of joy's first Valentine's Day, we can assume it's going to be a day to remember. \nWho knows, maybe the lovable husband and wife duo will even get to sneak out for a date night out on the town!
