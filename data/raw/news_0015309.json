Brady led the Patriots to the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history, overcoming a 25-point deficit in a 34-28 overtime victory against the shell-shocked Atlanta Falcons at NRG Stadium.\nTom Brady played in his seventh Super Bowl. (AP)\nNo team that had trailed by 10 or more points in the Super Bowl had come back to win. When former Oak Forest running back Tevin Coleman caught a six-yard touchdown pass, beating former Lincoln-Way Central star Rob Ninkovich to the right pylon with 8:31 left in the third quarter, the Falcons led 28-3.\n‘‘We all brought each other back,’’ said Brady, the Super Bowl MVP. ‘‘We never felt out of it. It was a tough battle. They’re a great team. I give them a lot of credit. We just made a few more plays than them.’’\nRunning back James White scored from the 1 with 57 seconds left in regulation, and Brady threw to receiver Danny Amendola for the two-point conversion to tie the score and force the first overtime in Super Bowl history.\nWhite scored the game-winner from the 2 eight plays after the Patriots called heads to get the ball first in the extra period and two plays after former Bears tight end Martellus Bennett drew a pass-interference call on the Atlanta Falcons’ De’Vondre Campbell in the end zone.\n‘‘He was the same as he always is — cool, calm and collected,’’ Amendola said. ‘‘He’s the leader, the general, the best ever.’’\nAfter Coleman’s touchdown, the Patriots needed 6½ minutes to score, with White scoring on a five-yard pass from Brady for the first of his three touchdowns. Stephen Gostkowski’s extra-point attempt hit the right upright, though, leaving the Patriots down 28-9. His 33-yard field goal with 9:48 left then pulled them within two scores at 28-12.\nOn third-and-one with 8:31 left, the Falcons inexplicably dropped back to pass. Patriots linebacker Dont’a Hightower blitzed and sacked Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, who was named the NFL’s most valuable player Saturday. Teammate Alan Branch recovered the ball the Falcons’ 30 with 8:24 left.\nAbout 2½ minutes later, Brady — who finished 43-for-62 for 466 yards and two touchdowns — found Amendola for a six-yard touchdown. White took a direct shotgun snap for a two-point conversion, and the Patriots trailed 28-20.\n‘‘It’s 28-12, and then we got 28-20 and then 28-28 and then 34-28,’’ Brady said. ‘‘Another play coming down to the end. How about that?’’\nThe Falcons began their next possession at the 10, and Ryan threw a dump pass that running back Devonta Freeman turned into a\n39-yard gain. A balletic catch by Julio Jones then moved the ball to the Patriots’ 22 and put the Falcons in position for at least a field goal that would have sealed the game.\nBut rather than run the ball — and the clock — the Falcons kept trying to throw. Ryan took a sack before the Falcons were whistled for a holding penalty, and they had to punt with 3:38 to play.\nThe Patriots started the tying drive from the 9. On third-and-10, Chris Hogan caught a 16-yard pass for a first down. Malcolm Mitchell then caught an 11-yarder before Julian Edelman made one of the great catches in Super Bowl history.\nBrady threw over the middle, and the ball was tipped into the air by cornerback Robert Alford. With two other Falcons defenders converging, Edelman dived for the ball, reaching between Alford’s legs and bobbling the ball before finally securing it an inch above the grass.\nWith 57 seconds left, White scored on a one-yard run to set up a two-point conversion attempt with a tie on the line. Brady threw left to Amendola, who scored despite the Falcons being offside.\nEarlier, it looked as though the Falcons would run away with the game. Freeman scored on a five-yard run to give them a 7-0 lead about three minutes into the second quarter. Ryan then found tight end Austin Hooper for a 19-yard touchdown to make it 14-0.\nThe Patriots were on the verge of getting on the board after three Falcons holding penalties gave them first downs, but Alford came up with a big play to thwart them.\nOn third-and-6 from the Falcons’ 23, Alford jumped in front of a pass intended for Amendola and took off down the right sideline for an 82-yard interception return for a touchdown and a 21-0 Falcons lead.\nCommissioner Roger Goodell presented the trophy to Patriots owner Robert Kraft amid a chorus of boos as loud as any cheer all night. Kraft, whose franchise had feuded with Goodell in the wake of Deflategate, called his fifth Super Bowl victory his sweetest yet.\n‘‘A lot has transpired in the last two years,’’ Kraft said.\nPatriots fans had anticipated that moment ever since, but it turned out to be the second-most amazing thing they had seen on a historic, mind-blowing Sunday.\nFollow me on Twitter @patrickfinley.\nEmail: pfinley@suntimes.com\n super-bowl", "external_links": ["https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66864941.jpg", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/bears_patriots_camp_football_63329406.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66864941.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66864941.jpg?w=150", "http://wp.me/p7fJAs-21DM", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/butler8.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66864515.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66864941.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/patriots_falcons_super_bowl_football_66864941.jpg?w=450"], "published": "2017-02-06T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:03:31.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
