Exports should not go ahead if there is a “clear risk” the equipment could be used to break international humanitarian law or commit human rights abuses.\nSaudi Arabia is the UK’s biggest weapons client: since the start of its campaign with other Middle Eastern nations in Yemen in March 2015, the government has granted licences for £3.3bn of munitions, aircraft and other military equipment for the campaign that has been largely waged from the air. But Saudi Arabia is accused of causing significant civilian casualties and destruction in one of the region’s poorest countries.\nA leaked UN report published by the Guardian in January 2016 recorded 119 strikes that were alleged to have breached the laws of war, including attacks on weddings, medical facilities, schools, markets and civilian infrastructure. It said such breaches were carried out in a “widespread and systematic” manner. On occasion, Saudi officials had designated entire cities to be military targets, the court heard.\n\nJavid was considering whether to suspend export licences to Saudi Arabia in February 2016, the court heard. He had been advised by the head of policy at the Export Control Organisation, then part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills: “We do have significant concerns regarding the acknowledged gaps in knowledge about Saudi targeting processes and about the military objectives of some of the strikes.”\nBell wrote in an email disclosed in court that it would be “prudent and cautious” to suspend licences “given the gaps in knowledge about Saudi operations”. He added: “I put this directly to the secretary of state in these terms.”\nOther officials regarded the decision as “finely balanced”, and the Foreign Office’s advice, in which it cited Ministry of Defence assessments of Saudi strikes, was that sales should continue. “While there’s a risk [of weapons being used for breaches of international law] here, the risk is not clear,” they wrote.\nThe government has argued that its arms export licensing regime is among the most robust in the world, but it has faced sustained criticism from campaigners, MPs and international NGOs for its refusal to pause licences as the conflict flared. In particular it has faced questions about the extent of its investigations into how British weapons have been used in the conflict.\nThe court heard that although the Ministry of Defence has a database called the Tracker that it uses to monitor allegations of violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict, it does not “consider whether the strike was against a target (such as a hospital) that attracts special protection”. A Ministry of Defence official said the Tracker does not consider “the alleged consequences of a strike, including the reported civilian casualties”.\nMartin Chamberlain QC, counsel for CAAT, pointed to this and other statements by MoD officials and said: “We now know the MoD conducts no routine attempt to reach an assessment in any individual case” to establish whether IHL [international humanitarian law] had been breached.\nThe Tracker is a spreadsheet, the court heard. It initially had a column titled, “IHL breach?” The court heard this was never filled in and was later deleted.\nOf 114 allegations of concern looked at in the spreadsheet up to January 2016, over a third were judged to be probably coalition air strikes. “Of these, MoD was unable to identify a legitimate military target in the majority,” the Foreign Office wrote in advice. For later periods the proportion was as high as three-quarters.\n“There comes a point where you do have to draw an inference and indeed there’s only one inference you can draw when the test is not: have you established that there are violations? but: is there a clear risk that they might be used to violate international humanitarian law?” Chamberlain said.\nThe case continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:01:05.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
