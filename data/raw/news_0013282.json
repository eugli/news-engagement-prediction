While up until now it was widely expected that LG would be unveiling the G6 at the event towards the end of this month, everything up until now was simply a tease and there hadn’t been any real confirmation that the device would be unveiled. LG has changed that today with the press invites, noting both the date, which is to be February 26th, as well as the time, which will be 12 PM local time in Barcelona at the Sant Jordi Club. \nOther than the location and the time of the event that LG is holding to show off their flagship device for the year, the only other information on the invite are the words “big screen that fits,” along with some imagery of the phone screen and a hand shown holding a phone shaped object, although the object is simply an outline of a device and not an actual picture of a phone. The imagery paired with the words big screen that fits seems to suggest that the LG G6 will indeed come with some pretty minimal bezels that will allow it to remain somewhat small in overall device size and fit into users’ hands more easily. Although this is not an actual confirmation about slim bezels or the phone’s design, the previous leaks have already more or less pointed out that the phone will have almost no bezels around the edge of the display, and this would simply reinforce those leaks and rumors. \nOther than a big screen that doesn’t increase the size of the phone too much, the LG G6 is expected to have some other useful features, as rumors note that LG will use copper heat pipes to divert the heat away from the device so that it can prevent the battery from overheating. It’s also rumored that the LG G6 will use the Snapdragon 821 CPU instead of the Snapdragon 835 due to Samsung’s exclusivity on the processor until the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus go on sale. The LG G6 is also rumored to go on sale on April 7th , giving LG a little over a month to get things in order after the big reveal.
