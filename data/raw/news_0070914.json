Moore then notified the conductor, but not before capturing about 12 seconds of footage of the bugs as they crawled across the woman’s belongings. \nMoore told WLS News that once the train’s crew had become aware of the problem, they evacuated all the passengers from his car. \n“They evacuate just that car from the train, and then we stop there for about 10 minutes and they clean the train,” he told WLS. \nOnce the crew was done cleaning, Moore boarded another train car to continue on his way — but so did the woman, still carrying the bug-filled bag, says Moore. \n\"It has holes in the bottom of the bag, and then she gets onto another train,\" he remarked. \nMoore adds that he and the woman boarded separate train cars upon re-entering the Red Line. \nWLS reports that the Chicago Transit Authority didn’t confirm whether the insects were actually bed bugs, but they did say they don’t prevent paying customers from entering their trains. \nSleep tight, Chicago.
