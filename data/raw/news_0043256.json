Full Time: Chelsea 13-0 Brighton. C.Brown (4), Taylor-Crossdale (3), McCormick (3), Gallagher, St Clair and C.Dasilva. — Chelsea Youth (@chelseayouth) February 18, 2017 \nCosta sealed a place in the quarter-finals in the 89th minute after defender Matt Doherty inadvertently deflected a pass into his path. \nThe prolific Chelsea striker had the time and space to easily stroke the ball into the Wolves goal, finally killing off the Championship side's brave resistance. \nHaving accounted for the Premier League scalps of Stoke City and Liverpool in previous rounds, Wolves looked in the mood to add the division's leaders to that list.
