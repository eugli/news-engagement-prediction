Trump praised Stephen Miller after the White House policy adviser’s whirlwind morning of representing the president on the Sunday political talk show circuit.\nBut Scarborough didn’t think Miller did so well.\n“I hope the president is talking about The Steve Miller Band and not that kid who embarrassed the White House this morning,” Scarborough tweeted Sunday night. “#SweatsLikeMarco.”\nI hope the president is talking about The Steve Miller Band and not that kid who embarrassed the White House this morning. #SweatsLikeMarco https://t.co/IqHiOXtE3V \n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 13, 2017 \n\n\nA combative Miller appeared on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” “Fox News Sunday,” ABC’s “This Week” and CBS’s “Face the Nation.” On “This Week,” Miller repeated Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud, including an allegation that thousands of people were bused from Massachusetts to New Hampshire to cast illegal votes in the Granite State.\n. @JoeNBC on Stephen Miller's weekend performance: That was horrendous and an embarrassment https://t.co/rE5Fxo8AF3 \n— Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) February 13, 2017 \n\n\n“Miller was awful on every level,” Scarborough continued. “When I hear the White House praising him, they sound like they’re living in an alternative universe.”\nMiller was awful on every level.

No. A really bad sign.”\nThe Steven Miller interviews this morning on all the Sunday shows were frightening! Sorry Mr President.

And I’ll take Steve Miller on my team over u any day.”\nJoe why don't you focus on getting your horrific ratings up. They totally suck.

But he has also used his platform to criticize the White House.\nIn a Twitter spat last month, Hannity also blasted Scarborough for his “pathetically low ratings” and accused him of trying to get a job at Fox.\n“Steve Miller works 18 hour days serving the country and the @POTUS,” Hannity added. “What do you do? Basically talk to yourself & @morningmika Nobody watches!”\nSteve Miller works 18 hour days serving the country and the @POTUS What do you do?
