After all, she had come together with Dunham and Albano for a talk called “Growing Up with Anxiety,” to bring light to an oft-stigmatized illness that too often requires those afflicted to suffer in silence, and therefore goes undiagnosed or untreated. Shedding the embarrassment surrounding anxiety medication was just one of the things Dunham and Konner were focused on doing in their hour-long conversation. “There’s this shame around [anxiety and depression] when it should be treated like it’s high cholesterol. It’s that treatable and it’s that common,” explained Konner, speaking before the show. “The shame is keeping everyone from moving forward.” It’s something Dunham is all too familiar with. “I don’t remember a time not being anxious,” she admitted to the audience, recalling the feeling she first discovered around age 4, when her parents realized that she wasn’t just a funny glass-half-empty kind of kid, but was instead often debilitated with worry about any number of improbable looming disasters. It sounds funny now, said Dunham, but at the time, it was chronic and debilitating. “I missed 74 days of 10th grade,” she confessed of becoming unresponsive and afraid to leave her house. When addressed directly and early on, anxiety can become something you live with while experiencing success in careers and relationships alike. “It’s something that everybody in my life, whether that’s Jenni as my business partner or my parents or my boyfriend or even my publicist knows and understands. If I didn’t have Jenni or Judd [Apatow],” both of whom have been public about their own struggles with anxiety, “I wouldn’t have been able to do this,” explained Dunham, acknowledging the success of Girls , as well as her 2014 memoir, Not That Kind of Girl , and her feminist newsletter Lenny Letter. Whether exploring the issue of OCD on her wildly popular HBO series, penning a personal essay about her adventures in therapy for The New Yorker , or talking publicly to experts about the latest research and treatment options, Dunham says she’s attempting to create a world in which we are “teaching kids from a young age that it’s as okay to say ‘I’m anxious’ as it is to say ‘I hit my knee.’ ” Albano agreed. A leading voice in child anxiety research, she has found that the condition often takes root around age four, and can bloom into depression by high school, leading to substance abuse and even suicide. The clearest path to treating it is to “remove the stigma around anxiety with parents,” she says. Instead of hiding the problem, explore treatment—the most successful of which she has found to be “a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and medication.” These days, Dunham and Konner are embracing an outward-facing philosophy, by dealing with their anxiety in the open. “Jenni tells me being ashamed about feeling anxious is punishing yourself twice,” says Dunham. In other words, why suffer any more than you already do? Albano’s professional opinion isn’t far off. “Raise awareness,” she said. “Tweet, write about it, talk about it—don’t hide with it.” As the audience members spilled onto Lexington Avenue moments later, they could be heard swapping stories of their own anxiety, their children’s, and their friends’.
