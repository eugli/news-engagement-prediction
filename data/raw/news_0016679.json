Why did this happen?\" Bychok asked. \"This incident happened because the police lost their cool and acted in the heat of the moment.\"\nTwo police officers spent hours outside of Holland's home on Jan. 17 waiting to arrest him should he leave the residence.\nAt one point Holland taunted the officers from a window.\nOfficers are required to obtain a warrant to enter someone's home but Bychok explained there are two exceptions: if someone`s safety inside the home is in peril or if police witness a crime and are in hot pursuit of a suspect.\n\"The only hot pursuit was the pursuit by a constable who was hot under the collar and by his supervisor who claims she did not understand the law,\" Bychok said.\nWhen Holland stepped outside to let his dog out and smoke a cigarette, one of the officers informed him he was under arrest.\nHolland cursed at the officer and went back inside.\nThe officer followed, testifying he believed he was in hot pursuit, something Bychok rejected.\n'Illegal acts' used in arrest, judge says \"I can not accept that any Canadian police officer does not understand the limits on their powers to arrest,\" he said, noting it's a concept nothing more basic than an officer's badge and uniform.\nThe officer kicked open two doors to enter the home, threw Holland against a wall, put him in a headlock then used a \"pain compliance technique\" by twisting Holland's arm behind his back and in doing so assaulted him, Bychok ruled.\nThe second officer followed behind and assisted with the arrest, constituting assault, said Bychok.\n\"These illegal acts undermine our trust in police,\" he said. \"It taints all police officers. This court can not turn a blind eye. These breaches must be sanctioned in a meaningful way. The question then becomes what is a fair and meaningful remedy?\n\"The sentence reduction must reflect the serious violation of the law,\" he said.\nHolland had previously entered guilty pleas to impaired driving causing bodily harm and driving while prohibited.\nHe also had entered guilty pleas for driving impaired and breaching probation after being caught earlier in January driving erratically in Iqaluit.\nFour months earlier, Holland had been convicted for driving impaired.\nHolland to serve 10 months Bychok planned on handing Holland a consecutive sentence of more than two years resulting in a federal penitentiary sentence served outside of the territory.\nInstead, he reduced it under the two year penitentiary threshold to 645 days.\nBychok then knocked off another 150 days – or five months – because of the charter breach by police.\nHolland revived 96 days off his sentence in a pre-sentence custody credit and another 90 days in part because of his guilty plea, leaving him little more than 10 months left to serve.\nBychok also ordered a four year driving ban, 18 months probation and 60 hours of community service for Holland.\n\"Mr. Holland's case is about repeated drunk driving. It is about the terrible decisions people can make when they're drunk.\n\"It is about what happens when drunk people drive,\" Bychok said. \"Nunavut is in crisis. Alcohol abuse is tearing apart our society.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:43:32.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
