Sabbir Rahman stands at the crease with Mahmudullah, Bangladesh's last recognised batting pair. \nOn Sunday, the Tigers lost Tamim Iqbal early on. While Mominul Haque and Soumya Sarkar looked like steadying the ship, both fell within 1 delivery, leaving Bangladesh reeling at 103 for 3 at the close of play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:54:05.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
