Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images Was one of your New Year’s resolutions to “Say yes” to everything because you watched that Tony Robbins documentary on Netflix during the break? (he revs people by coaching them to say yes five times). Nah, says burgeoning hair-care entrepreneur, Gabrielle Union , that resolution should be cancelled. She has an better tip from her new issue of Women’s Health , which explains why she appears to be aging at a practically vampiric rate:\n“My best anti-aging tip is the ability to say no , no, and hell, no. We run ourselves ragged saying yes to every freaking thing, whether it’s to our family, spouses, or careers. I sleep eight hours a day and don’t let myself stress out. A lot of people call it selfish, but I don’t have any wrinkles.” It’s a lot less expensive than any anti-aging cream.\nTags: beauty gabrielle union anti aging women's health wrinkles say no skin deep More Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories What It’s Like to Be ‘a Little Bit Pregnant’ We Finally Know How Gabrielle Union Ages Slower Than Everyone Else There’s a Huge Sale on Riccardo Tisci’s Best Givenchy Pieces Right Now Most Viewed Stories People Are Taking to Twitter to Show Trump What It Really Means to Dress Like a Woman Trump Is Reportedly Obsessed With How the People Who Work For Him Dress Something About This Photo Sure Feels Familiar Alt-Right Troll Milo Yiannopoulos Uses Campus Visit to Openly Mock a Transgender Student In Defense of Letting Yourself Go Why Won’t We Let Madonna Age the Way She Wants To?
