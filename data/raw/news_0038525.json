These are the reasons… \n• Dangerous bacteria can attach to your phone and spread to other people as well. \n• A study conducted in 2016 found that you’re risking your health by taking your device with you into the bathroom. \n• There are water and air particles that harbour in the little creases of the phone. And phone covers and cases are usually made out of rubber, which is a warm and comfortable harbouring ground for bacteria. \n• This bacteria include salmonella, E.coli, shigella and campylobacter, according to WebMD, all of which can make you very sick. • You’re also at risk of spreading viruses like gastroenteritis (infectious diarrhoea) and Staphylococcus aureus, which can be easily transmitted from solid surfaces like your phone. \n• So, never ever take your phone to the bathroom, especially public ones. \n• Even if you’re not using your phone on the toilet, you’re still holding it while you’re going in and out of the bathroom, and that’s enough to put bacteria on the phone when you haven’t yet washed your hands. \n• Given that many people also use their phone when eating, many infections can be transmitted by mouth. \n• This also increases the risk factor of getting sick from bacteria on your phone. So, what can you do to try and mitigate this risk of spreading infections and getting sick? \n• First, don’t take your phone into the bathroom at all, and try not to use it when eating. \n• Disinfecting your phone regularly is also a good idea, especially if you’ve been using it in the bathroom. \n• Specific sprays can be bought to clean touchscreens, and a screen protector can help too. \n• Wash your hands regularly, especially when leaving the bathroom or touching anyone else’s smartphone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:49:10.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
