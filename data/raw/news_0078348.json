Nigel Farage \nMr Farage claimed Ukip's only MP wanted to “neutralise” the party when he joined, because he felt it was too “angry” and “nativist”. \nStill “very close” to his former Tory colleague MEP Daniel Hannan, Mr Carswell is said to have greatly opposed immigration during the referendum campaign because his “middle-class friends\" would have been \"put off” from voting Leave. Nigel Farage in pictures Thu, December 15, 2016 Nigel Farage is a British politician who has been the leader of the UK Independence Party since October 2016. Getty Images 1 of 48 British politician Nigel Farage arrives at Trump Tower on December 15, 2016 in New York City. President-elect Donald Trump and his transition team are in the process of filling cabinet and other high level positions for the new administration. \nThe 52-year-old who had dinner with US President Donald Trump earlier this week claimed Mr Carswell aggressively phoned him to gain “absolute assurance” Mr Farage would not play a leading part in the referendum campaign. \nBut the Brexiteer said: “It seemed very illogical to me at the time that Douglas Carwell opposed our stance on the key issue of immigration, and indeed at times even attempted to sabotage my leadership. \n“If he didn’t like me or our policy on immigration, why on earth did he join the party in the first place?” \nTensions between the two politicians re-surfaced last week as leaked emails seen by the Daily Telegraph revealed Mr Carswell mocking Mr Farage’s chances of obtaining a knighthood. \nMr Carswell reportedly said Mr Farage should receive an award for “services to headline writers\", instead of the esteemed honour. TWITTER The eurosceptic met with Donald Trump in his Washington hotel \nAlthough Mr Carswell is Ukip's only MP, Mr Farage slammed his efforts in maintaining the party's only seat within Parliament because Clacton will always be pro-Ukip.
