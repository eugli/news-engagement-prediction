Advertisement More by this Author \nFormer Director of Public Prosecutions Philip Murgor has said drug barons had infiltrated the country’s Executive, Judiciary and security agencies. \nMr Murgor, who has announced his presidential bid, said on Wednesday that drug dealers were dishing out millions of shillings to politicians and high ranking security and judiciary officials to buy protection. \nIn an open letter to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto — sent to the Daily Nation — Mr Murgor talked of how he was hounded out of office by senior officials in the Kibaki regime “due to my efforts to bring to justice the owners of the Sh6.4 billion cocaine haul”. \n“The most infamous incident occurred in December 2004 while I was serving as DPP. Police received intelligence from European governments that large quantities of cocaine were in Kenya being prepared for shipment to Europe. They reluctantly seized 1.1 tonnes of high grade cocaine ... This was the largest seizure on the continent at the time,” he said. \nCONDUCT SHAM INVESTIGATIONS \nThe UDM presidential hopeful said high ranking officers in the police and Attorney-General’s office conspired to conduct sham investigations.
