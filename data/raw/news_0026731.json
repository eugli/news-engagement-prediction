It took me a long time to get over it and get it right. That’s the concern I have with women’s football. Dee KO'd by brutal bump 1:16 \n“There are a lot of girls who haven’t played a whole lot of AFL football at the top level and not as fulltime professionals.” \nAFLW has received rave reviews in its first fortnight, leading to coverage that is normally reserved for fully-fledged professional sport. \nHowever Kennelly cautioned against expectations of grandeur, suggesting a patient approach is required from fans and the media alike. \n“Yes we are going to critique them as if they are fulltime because it’s on TV … But they are not,” he said. \n“The (behind the play) stuff is unacceptable at any level — man, woman or child.” \nLive stream EVERY game of the JLT Community Series on FOX SPORTS.

Footy is that you want to tackle hard and make that contest. Maybe the girls are going just a little bit too hard and maybe it will even itself out.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:20:58.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
