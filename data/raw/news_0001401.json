Yuzvendra Chahal celebrates taking a wicket against England in Bangalore (Twitter @ICC) Matthew Scott \nPublished on Feb. 1, 2017 \nFeb. 1, 2017 \nThe Test and ODI series against India were marred for England by collapses, but they went the whole hog in losing the T20I decider in Bangalore on Wednesday. \nMORE: Selector takes swipe at White | Johnson calls out selectors \nEoin Morgan (40) and Joe Root (42) had the tourists ahead of the rate as they chased 202, but they fell in successive deliveries to spark the mother of all collapses. Yuzvendra Chahal returned the best T20I figures by an Indian (6-25) with Jasprit Bumrah (3-14) his able sidekick as England were skittled for 127 in 16.3 overs. \nWe've given you a few ways to digest the incredible information. So sit back, relax, and marvel at the utter incompetence of Morgan's men, picking up the action midway through the 13th over... A six-wicket haul for @yuzi_chahal ! The first 5+ wicket haul for India in T20Is! Stunning performance! #IndvEng pic.twitter.com/KikWZft2yl \nNineteen balls. Eight runs. Eight wickets. \nW W . . . W 1 1 1 1 W . 4 W . W W .
