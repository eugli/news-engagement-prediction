The pair have three children: Jackson, 17, Ava, 11 and River, 10, together. \nStefanovic had tried to keep his private life under wraps, until shots of him with his new love, snatching quiet time away form birthday revellers lying on the bow of the luxury yacht, were splashed across the front page of The Sunday Telegraph . \nEarlier this month he opened up about ‘rectifying his failures as a dad ’ in the wake of the split. \n“For me personally I would definitely have failures in a husband sense and hope that I can rectify my failures as a dad,” he told The Herald Sun .
