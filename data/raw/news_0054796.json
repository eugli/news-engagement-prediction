Girl tweets warnings after finding lost iPhones aren't as confidential as you may think \nAnd, perhaps controversially, the phone will have a colour display – although it’s not expected to be high resolution so that it can keep battery power. \nIt’s not expected that it will run android as it’s a ‘feature phone’ according to Vtech, but the desin will largely be the same as the old one. \nWe’re expecting announcements from the Mobile World Congress which is taking place in Barcelona next week. \nThe phone was discontinued in 2005 – but now there’s new hope for people who want a no frills handset that can stay on for up to ten days.

All the Siri commands you'll ever need \nMobile phone reporter Evan Blass said that the phone will be a ‘homage’ to the 3310. \nIts reportedly intended to be marketed to European consumers, who may be willing to use it as a second phone. \nSales could be driven by a nostalgia factor, given that the phone has kept a kind of cult status among people who remember how long it lasted compared to today’s iPhones and Samsung Galaxies. \nThe event will be held on February 26 in Barcelona.
