U.S. President Donald Trump has a history of saying false things, big and small. He said 17 of them at one raucus news conference at the White House on Thursday. ( Mario Tama / GETTY IMAGES ) By Daniel Dale Washington Bureau Fri., Feb. 17, 2017 U.S. President Donald Trump makes frequent false claims about matters big and small. The Star is tracking them all: 80 as of Feb. 17, 2017, just four weeks into his presidency . Contact Daniel Dale at if you hear Trump say anything you know is false or should be checked . WASHINGTON—U.S. President Donald Trump summoned reporters to the East Room of the White House on Thursday for a press conference . His primary purpose: bashing the media, an entity he called “so dishonest” and “out of control.” He did not model the kind of truthfulness he said he was seeking — making 17 separate false claims over 77 minutes. 1. The claim: “I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan.” In fact: George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama all earned bigger margins in the electoral college than Trump did. Article Continued Below 2. The claim about former campaign manager Paul Manafort: “He said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. He said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it forcefully. Most of the papers do not print it because it's not good for their stories.” In fact : The New York Times story Trump was criticizing included Manafort’s denial, in which he said he never “knowingly” had contact with Russian intelligence officers. Other major outlets that followed up on the story also printed a denial from Manafort. 3. The claim: “I will say that I never get phone calls from the media. How do they write a story like that in the Wall Street Journal without asking me or how do they write a story in the New York Times put it on the front page.” In fact : Media outlets almost always call his administration for comment on major stories. The Journal, in its story about U.S. intelligence declining to share some information with Trump, prominently quoted a denial from an anonymous administration official. The Times also sought comment for its story, but the administration declined to provide one. 4. The claim: “Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. OK?” In fact: This is not even close to true. Trump indeed gave near-daily speeches during the campaign, but he did not do a single news conference over the last three months of the campaign. The 5 other front page stories the Star could run after Trump’s wild presser 5. The claim: “We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban.” In fact : We don’t usually fact-check claims like “smooth”— it’s vague, and it’s a matter of opinion — but the rollout of the travel ban was so obviously not smooth that we’re making an exception here. The implementation of the ban resulted in mass confusion among U.S. allies like Canada, caused travel problems for thousands of visa-holders and permanent residents, necessitated a series of clarifications and reversals by U.S. officials, and appeared so hasty that a federal appeals court has found that the administration may have violated residents’ constitutional right to due process. 6. The claim: “That’s the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports.” In fact : The Delta outage had nothing to do with the chaos created by the travel ban. The travel ban caused mass confusion on a Saturday; the Delta outage occurred more than a day and a half later, on a Sunday night . 7. The claim about labour secretary nominee Alex Acosta: “He’s a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board.” In fact : Acosta is not currently a member of the board . He served on it from 2002 to 2003. 8. The claim about the news media: “I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that’s right.” In fact: The media is unpopular with Americans, but Congress has consistently been even less popular. Last year, Gallup found that just 9 per cent had confidence in Congress ; 20 per cent had confidence in newspapers, 21 per cent in television news. While the new Congress is now up to a 28 per cent approval rating, Gallup found in September that 32 per cent said they had trust in the media. 9. The claim: “ Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they’re not giving classified information.” In fact : Trump may have been attempting to refer specifically to WikiLeaks release of emails related to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, which were not classified. But he ended up wrongly suggesting that WikiLeaks does not provide classified information at all. The organization made its name releasing hundreds of thousands of pages of classified U.S. material. 10. The claim: “The failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know.” In fact : The article , headlined “Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated Contacts With Russian Intelligence,” has not been discredited. 11. The claim: “And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.” In fact: One of the people mentioned in the New York Times story, Trump associate Roger Stone, went on television to deny having any contact with any Russians. But the other people mentioned in the story did not issue such categorical denials in any medium. Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, told the New York Times that he never “knowingly” had contact with Russian intelligence officers, adding that such people do not “wear badges.” Former Trump adviser Carter Page he had only “said hello to a few Russian officials over the course of the last year or so”; he also gave a speech in Moscow. 12. The claim about the 9th Circuit appeals court: “In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 per cent — I find that hard to believe; that’s just a number I heard — that they’re overturned 80 per cent of the time. ” In fact : This statement is false in one way, possibly misleading in another. It is false that the 9th Circuit is overturned by the Supreme Court at a “record number.” Even in the study conservatives usually cite in criticizing the 9th Circuit, the court had the second-highest reversal rate between 1999 and 2008. Between 2010 and 2015, it was third-highest . In the most recent court term for which complete data is readily available, the 9th Circuit was again in second place. It may be misleading to discuss reversal rates this way at all. The Supreme Court overturns a majority of cases it agrees to hear — but those cases represent a tiny fraction of total cases decided by a circuit court. So even if 80 per cent of 9th Circuit cases that reach the Supreme Court are overturned, that still means more than 99 per cent of the circuit’s total decisions are not overturned. 13. The claim about the 9 th Circuit appeals court: “I think that circuit is — that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil.” In fact : The court is functioning as normal. There is no sign of chaos or turmoil. 14. The claim: “We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 per cent of the uranium in our country.” Added: “Hillary Clinton gave them 20 per cent of our uranium.” In fact : Clinton didn’t personally give Russia uranium . The State Department, which Clinton led as secretary of state, was one of nine government entities that reviewed the Russian purchase of the Toronto-based firm Uranium One, which controlled the rights to about 20 per cent of U.S. uranium capacity. There is no evidence Clinton was personally involved in the process in any way. Further, only the president could have made the decision to block the deal; Clinton did not have final authority either way. 15. The claim: “This administration is running like a fine- tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my cabinet approved. And they’re outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who’s there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can’t get approved. How do you not approve him?” In fact : We’ll ignore the dubious “fine-tuned machine” claim — there is no sign that Coats, Trump’s nominee for Director of National Intelligence, “can’t get approved” or is even facing obstruction. The Republican who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, Sen. Richard Burr, told The Hill they are waiting for the FBI and others to finish background checks, and that they will hold a hearing when the Senate returns from its one-week break. 16. The claim: “Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives.” In fact : The Walmart expansion plan that is creating the jobs was announced in October , before Trump was elected. The company did not reveal the precise 10,000 figure until after Trump took office, but it is directly connected to the previous announcement. 17. The claim: “General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I’m announcing would never have come here.” In fact : GM made a new $1 billion commitment to U.S. factories, not “billions”; it committed $2.9 billion last year, before Trump was elected . GM did not offer any indication that it made the decision because of Trump, and independent automotive analysts said it was unlikely the company had done so. “Mostly theatre to play in the news cycle created by President-elect Trump’s tweets,” Autotrader analyst Michelle Krebs said . “These investments and hiring plans have long been in the works and are a continuation of what the company has been doing in recent years.” Read more about: Delivered daily The Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.
