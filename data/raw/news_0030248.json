Locals seen fishing at a jetty near Redang Beach. \nSekinchan assemblyman Ng Suee Lim had recommended that I drop in at Ah Ma House (Grandma’s House), a shop that sells traditional biscuits like kuih kapit . \nI think the bigger attraction there was the shop itself, which is fashioned to look like a kampung house, albeit a more modern one. \nIt is filled with items from yesteryear, such as an old school sewing machine, television, fan and other retro items that may seem foreign to the younger generation. \nThere are many Instagram opportunities here, and sure enough, many visitors could be seen posing with the retro items. \nVisitors can also ride in the antique car for a fee. \nAcross the road is “Kampung Atuk” (Grandfather’s Hometown). \nThis left me rather puzzled as to why grandma and grandpa lived in different quarters, separated by a road. \nIt turns out, the actual story is a lot less dramatic. The Lover‘s Bridge in front of Kampung Atuk. \nAccording to locals, the two places are owned by different people, hence “grandpa” and “grandma” are not related. \nI guess the Lover’s Bridge in front of Kampung Atuk is also a mere attraction and has nothing to do with any love story. \nAnyway, at “grandfather’s place” is the Sekinchan Ocean Gallery, but I did not feel compelled to enter it. Maybe another time. \nBut I did buy some homemade fish and potato crackers from the friendly vendor in front of the gallery. \nThe vendor said there is a 3D museum and maze down the road, but on checking online, I discovered that the maze may have closed. \nPreferring something less touristy and with more of a local flavour, I headed to a nearby padi-processing factory. \nIt has a gallery opened to the public and they charge an entry fee of RM5, but you do get a mini bag of the same value in return. The gallery at the padi-processing factory offers photo opportunity for visitors. \nThere are videos explaining the rice-planting process and a guide provides further information as we view the rice-packing process from above. \nAt the end of the tour is a souvenir shop selling rice and rice-related products. \nMany buy bags of rice, maybe because it was the Chinese New Year season and the Chinese believe it’s lucky to have sufficient rice in store for the new year. \nI did not expect my visit to turn into a shopping trip, but at the end of the day, I had spent a three-figure sum on local products such as fish balls, fruits and, yes, several bags of rice. \nSo fellow shopaholics, do bring enough cash. The items from yesteryear at Ah Ma House give off a nostalgic feel. \nI ended the trip with a visit to Redang Beach, not to be confused with Redang Island, where many visitors were flying kites or gathering to enjoy the sunset. \nWith its village charm and helpful locals, Sekinchan definitely warrants a return trip – hopefully with a group of friends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:30:28.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
