Here's a look at the men who will play a key role in Panneerselvam's endeavour: O Panneerselvam 1. V Maitreyan Among the first to cross over to the Panneerselvam camp, this Rajya Sabha MP has been assigned to meet governor C Vidyasagar Rao and apprise him. He will coordinate matters with regard to the governor. 2. K P Munusamy He will be useful for his sharp and bold attacks on Sasikala 's family members. The former minister was taking them on by himself even before Panneerselvam broke away. 3. K Pandiarajan This businessman-turned-politician has been entrusted with the task of roping in high profile MLAs like R Nataraj and AIADMK ally and Nagapattinam MLA Thamimun Ansari. 4. Natham R Viswanathan As a member of Jayalalithaa 's 'Aivar Ani' (five-man team), Viswanathan was privy to internal machinations and planning. The former minister will reach out to MLAs in the south. 5. P H Pandian The OPS faction hopes to draw on the AIADMK co-founder's experience as an assembly speaker and deputy speaker in the state assembly. He will provide inputs on constitutional matters. 6. E Madhusoodanan The former AIADMK presidium chairman was a key player during the formative years of AIADMK. His rich experience will help get MLAs from Chennai constituencies. 7. C Ponnaiyan The former minister and AIADMK spokesman is the much-needed expert on legal matters. He held the law portfolio for 16 years under the MGR and Jayalalithaa regimes and is well-versed in law.
