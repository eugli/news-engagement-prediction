The setup is purrfect: The kittens live in a dollhouse outfitted with hidden cameras. Viewers can binge-watch all the action. (Or lack thereof: There's plenty of catnapping.) Inga Lind Karlsdóttir is the brains behind the internet's first kitten reality show. She told Vice's Broadly that it was created in partnership with the Icelandic Cat Protection Society. The stars are kittens from a shelter.

All the people who were laughing then aren't laughing now.\" The internet was made for cats, of course, and Karlsdóttir said the response has been tremendous. The series has already drawn the highest-ever traffic to the website of Icelandic broadcaster Nutiminn, Karlsdóttir said. \"We like everything they do,\" she said. \"It's fun when they go crazy and ruin the house, but it's also calming to watch them sleep. It's good for the soul.\" With all that's going on in the world, Karlsdóttir added, \"it's nice to sit there and relax and watch the kittens.\" The original four cats have been adopted, she said, and a new cat cast brought in. Sadly, Karlsdóttir won't be bringing any kittens home: She said her daughter is allergic. \"But 'Keeping Up With The Kattarshians' is great for people with allergies,'\" she said. \"You can just sit there and watch the cats on your computer screen.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:55:50.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
