And all forms of vandalism committed by out-of-school youth or street gangs on public and private properties could be prevented or lessened somehow when night falls. \nAs a whole, the imposition of a nationwide curfew, particularly in Metro Manila, could also minimize the workload of police night patrols in the wee hours of the morning or the graveyard shift. But proper guidelines should first be issued, implemented and followed by the authorities concerned. ADVERTISEMENT \nPEDRO V.
