Margi Murphy The Sun \nA FATHER-OF-THREE died during a 24 hour gaming marathon he was live streaming to raise money for the Make A Wish foundation. \nPopular gamer Brian Vigneault, who went under the username Poshybrid, is believed to have disappeared from view during the 22nd hour of the live stream on gaming network Twitch. \nViewers grew concerned when Vigneault, from Virginia Beach in the USA, failed to return to his webcam after leaving to smoke a cigarette at around 3.30am local time. \nAt around 11am moderators and viewers assumed he had fallen asleep, but later the following evening a friend saw him online and sent him a message. \nHe was met with a response from a person claiming to be a detective from the police department, who explained that Mr Vigneault had died. \nVirginia Police confirmed Mr Vigneault had passed away, but could not reveal the circumstances behind his death. \nIt’s understood to be the first time a gamer has died on the platform.
