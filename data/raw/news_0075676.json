In November 2015, 130 people were killed in Paris when gunmen and suicide bombers from Islamic State attacked bars, restaurants, a concert hall and the Stade de France. \nThat attack came 10 months after two jihadi gunmen shot dead cartoonists and journalists at the Paris offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. \nHidalgo paid tribute to the strength of the French capital in standing up to terrorism. “There is a risk of terrorism in all major cities,” said Hidalgo, whose city is bidding to host the 2024 Olympics. “But Paris is doing well; Paris is a resilient city.” \nHidalgo was in Japan to drum up tourism and inspect Tokyo 2020 Olympic sites. “Japanese tourists are coming back again. There has been a very substantial increase in booking numbers – up 80% in the first two months of this year compared to last year. That is very good news,” she said. \nThe 2024 hosts will be decided by an International Olympic Committee vote in Lima in September.
