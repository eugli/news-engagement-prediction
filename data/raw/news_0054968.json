We are trying to find out. \n\"But if it is a very small amount, it would have been very hard to detect,\" Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters at the KL International Airport on Friday. \nEarlier, Khalid said in a statement that the chemical used in the murder had been identified as the highly toxic VX-nerve agent. \nKhalid also said that the North Korean embassy had not responded to police's request to speak to two North Koreans believed to be connected to the murder. \nOn Thursday, Khalid said police would follow protocol in seeking to question Hyon Kwang-song, who has diplomatic immunity. \nPolice are also keen to question a staff of North Korean airline in its investigations. \nJong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was killed after two women swab his face with a chemical at KL International Airport 2 on Feb 13 as he was waiting to board a flight to Macau. \nFour people have been arrested to assist in the investigations. \nRelated stories:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:00:59.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
