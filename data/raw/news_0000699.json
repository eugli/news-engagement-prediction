Awesome stuff.\n— Crankynick (@crankynick) February 2, 2017 #Telstra my dad is receiving text messages from people he doesn't know!

We're working to resolve ASAP. Thanks for your patience.\n— Telstra (@Telstra) February 2, 2017 Some flights disrupted due to @Telstra outage. 9 AU flights delayed ~45mins; check-in for some flights paused; some ports manual check-in.\n— Jetstar Airways (@JetstarAirways) February 2, 2017 A further tweet confirmed the fire was in Chatswood, Sydney, and it had damaged power equipment.\nTelstra tweeted about 3pm that services were starting to be restored, several hours after the first reports of the network problems.\nThe Aussie Outages site reported 5077 complaints of network problems, with customers in states across Australia reporting problems.\nMany Telstra customers took to social media to complain about how the network outage was impacting their business.\nmedia_camera A notice sent out from the CFA regarding the incident at the Telstra exchange. Picture: Facebook\n“Cannot call or receive calls from a mobile — great situation for a sales rep,” said Steve, of Boronia, Victoria.\n“My mobile can receive text messages but I cannot call Telstra or call out. My land line is also dead. What is happening. This is my business phone and I’m cut off!” Sarah of York, Western Australia said.\nTelstra also reported outages with NBN services for customers in NSW although it was not clear if that was linked to the Chatswood fire.\nCongrats Telstra.

Bad form Telstra, bad form.\n— Dave Murray (@dclnmurray) February 2, 2017 Telstra released a statement about 2.30pm saying the fire had been contained but that damage had been caused to power infrastructure.\n“As a result a number of customers are experiencing loss of service,” the statement said.\n“Our technicians are currently completing a full assessment of the impact.”\nThe national problem follows a string of network meltdowns in 2016, which caused Telstra to announce a $50 million plan to build a more robust network and add more levels of redundancy that would help avoid a national meltdown following a single problem.\nSpeaking to News Corp Australia late last year, Telstra CEO Andy Penn said he could not guarantee the network would never have another meltdown.\n“What I can guarantee though is that its absolutely got our full attention and backed up with a significant amount of investment, both in terms of addressing the issues we’ve identified but also building the resiliency and redundancy in the future,” he said.\nTelstra was not the only one left red-faced after technical difficulties today. The ATO website was also down for several hours, with the ATO blaming the crash again on the problematic Hewlett-Packard Enterprise hardware system that suffered a major failure in December.\nOriginally published as ‘I’ve never known that to happen before’", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/Telstra?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/dclnmurray/status/826998759334645760", "https://twitter.com/TrainLinkNorth/status/827004236454047744", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/mobile-phones/exchange-fire-sparks-telstra-mobile-landline-network-meltdown/news-story/f8648326ad6dcbd1e7ec5f034d60a6af", "https://twitter.com/BlastmediaAu/status/827009132309778432", "https://t.co/JhRzT7XKg1", "https://twitter.com/JFlinders17/status/826981965899329536", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/telstra?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/HunterLine?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/jtwnz/status/826995472850001920", "https://www.livetraffic.com/desktop.html#mapview", "https://twitter.com/Telstra/status/826983572212887553", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/f8648326ad6dcbd1e7ec5f034d60a6af?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://m.livetraffic.rta.nsw.gov.au/Default.aspx?r=SYD_ALL", "http://www.sydneytrains.info/mobile/service_interruptions", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Chatswood?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/JetstarAirways/status/827000936992215045", "https://twitter.com/crankynick/status/827009204762193920", "https://twitter.com/Telstra", "https://twitter.com/a_r_riddell/status/827016068031881216", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TUSO?src=hash", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/41911af5204fd77d84d7e57841ac4eca?width=650"], "published": "2017-02-02T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T16:42:12.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
