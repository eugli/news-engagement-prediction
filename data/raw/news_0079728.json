Nobody says 'believe me,' unless they are lying.\" \n\"It is time to get your groove back, media,\" said Stewart, talking to the camera \"that goes straight to the media.\" \n\"Hey, media. So I heard Donald Trump broke up with you. It stings a little, doesn't it? You finally thought you met your match: a blabbermouth who's as thin-skinned and narcissistic as you are. Well good riddance, I say! Kick him to the curb.\" \n\"It didn't work out, did it? Because 70-year-old men don't get less cranky or racist as time goes by,\" Stewart joked. \"Unless they are visited at night by three spirits.\" \nThe last time Stewart appeared on The Late Show , he came in costume in a wig and over-long red tie, mimicking Trump and joking about his wardrobe. \n\"I thought this is how men dress now,\" Stewart explained to Colbert. \"The president sets men's fashion. I saw the inauguration â€” super long tie, dead animal on head. Boom.\" \nHe also addressed Trump's executive orders, then only 11 days into his presidency, which, Stewart joked, \"is supposed to age the president, not the public.\" \n\"No one action will be adequate,\" was Stewart's message to the crowd. \"All actions will be necessary, and if we do not allow Donald Trump to exhaust our fight and somehow come through this presidency calamity-less and constitutionally partially intact, then I, Donald J. Trump, will have demonstrated the greatness of America, just not the way I thought I was gonna.\" \nHe also joined Colbert on Election Eve last year for a musical number and plea to voters .
