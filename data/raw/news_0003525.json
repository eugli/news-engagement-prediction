Credit: Ron Sachs/© 2017 Bloomberg Finance LP Ruth Sherlock , Washington 1 February 2017 • 10:05pm \nA new trade deal between the United States and the United Kingdom could be established in as little as two years, experts said on Wednesday. \nThe testimony was part of a first hearing in the US congress dedicated to a new trans-Atlantic partnership following Britain's exit from the European Union. \nTed Poe, the chairman of the congressional foreign affairs committee heralded the \"special relationship\" between the two nations, calling a bilateral trade deal as an opportunity to \"deepen our alliance even further\". \nSeveral members of congress, including Marco Rubio, the former Republican presidential candidate have already proposed draft resolutions, calling on Donald Trump to make this arrangement a central part of his foreign policy. \nThe Congressional Research Service notes that Britain is America’s largest services trading partner. And it is America’s largest foreign direct investor; roughly one million US jobs depend on British companies based in America. \nMore than 1.25 million people are employed by US affiliates in the UK. \nSpeaking at the committee hearing on Wednesday, Nile Gardiner, the director of the Heritage Foundation - the conservative think tank from which Mr Trump drew many members of his transition team - said he believed the trade arrangement could be implemented \"within 90 days\" of Britain leaving the EU. \nTheresa May, the Prime Minister, has indicated she plans to formally declare in March that the UK intends to leave the EU. That would trigger Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union, which provides for a two-year process to negotiate the terms of separation. \nBut others countered that this timeline was overly optimistic, warning that, despite the good will for a close trade relationship between America and Britain, the details of the agreement will make it complex to implement. \nDaniel Hamilton, at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced and International Studies. He warned that regulatory issues could pose major obstacle as the two countries would have to agree on everything from rules on food safety standards to labour rights. \nSome experts have warned the deal would be might be contingent on London accepting US for regulations that would allow the importing of, currently banned, genetically modified foods, and beef with growth hormones. \nMr Hamilton said the arrangement would be contentious for British farmers, who will have lost EU subsidies and would likely oppose the new competition that it would bring. He also said that a large mount of US business in the UK is in the finance, with the London banking sector being used as a gateway to the EU. But, he said, Britain is likely to lose its \"right to ''passport'' these financial services\" to the continent. \n\"America's significant commercial and financial presence in the UK is premised in large part on UK membership in the EU,\" he said, calling the EU \"the largest, wealthiest and most important foreign market in the world to US companies. \n\"US companies are based in the UK because of its role as a gateway to the Single Market,\" the said. \"US negotiators will want to know how open, wide and strong that gateway will be after Brexit.\" \nHe said trade between UK and the EU would remain critical for the British economy even after Brexit. And that London would first need to negotiate a new trade and investment agreement with European countries before committing to an American economic alliance. This could potentially delay a trade deal with the US for six years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:26:19.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
