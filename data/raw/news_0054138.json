The White House later said Mr Trump was referring to rising crime in general, but his comments were still widely mocked.\nDanish artist Artpusher has organised the ironic memorial at Sweden's embassy in Copenhagen to honour the \"victims\" of the non-existent incident, in what he says is a protest against misinformation and fake news.\n\"Following the terrible attack on our sister country Sweden reported by US President Trump, the Nordic countries now stand united,\" the Pray For Sweden Facebook page reads , adding that the \"love-filled\" event has been approved by the Danish police.\nArtpusher tells The Local that the vigil is not an anti-Trump protest. \"This is about being able to make your own mind up and make a decision based on facts. This is bigger than Trump,\" he says. \"I don't have money or power, but I can try and use humour and irony to make people aware of things.\"\nMore than 1,200 people have responded to say they will attend, although ArtPusher thinks that the actual number will be much lower. Nonetheless he's hoping it will be a pleasant affair, telling Metroxpress that he might try to persuade the embassy to provide some hot chocolate and buns to those who show up.\nNext story: Moscow takes wrecking ball to old flats\nUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter .", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/events/1858922141053223/", "http://www.mx.dk/nyheder/danmark/story/16433711", "http://www.thelocal.dk/20170221/a-thousand-sign-up-for-copenhagen-pray-for-sweden-march", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39023978", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/13C9B/production/_94815018_embassy_of_sweden_in_copenhagen.jpg", "https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NewsfromElsewhere&src=typd"], "published": "2017-02-23T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:22:20.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
