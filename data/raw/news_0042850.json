That may not be the case anymore. \nThe latest Atom C3000 chips announced on Tuesday have up to 16 cores and are more sophisticated than ever. The chips are made for storage arrays, networking equipment, and internet of things devices. [ Further reading: Intel looks to modernize data centers with new Xeon server chips ] \nThe new chips have features found mostly in server chips, including networking, virtualization, and error correction features. \nNetworking and storage devices don't require a lot of horsepower, so the low-power Atom chips fit right in. Only a handful of Intel server chips have more than 16 cores, but the number of Atom cores means the chip can handle more streams of data. \nThe Atom C3000 fits into Intel's long-term plan to grow in the server, IoT and storage markets. \nIntel quit making Atom chips for smartphones last May, and the chip lineup was reconfigured to include E3900 chips for IoT devices and the T5700 and T5500 chips used on the Joule maker boards. \nChinese chip maker Rockchip is still making variants of the older Sofia 3G chip, which is now being redirected to low-power IoT devices. \nA surprising set of features in C3000 are so-called RAS (reliability, availability, and serviceability) capabilities, found mostly on high-end Xeon chips. The features correct data errors on the fly and prevent networking and storage equipment from crashing. \nIntel is also providing development kits for writing storage and networking applications for the chips. \nThe new chips are already shipping to testers and will become available in the second half of this year. \nThe Atom C3000 succeeds the older C2000 chips, which were originally targeted at microservers and networking and storage equipment. The Atom C2000 chips recently ran into trouble with a flaw that could crash servers and networking equipment. Intel has provided a temporary fix, but the company is working on a permanent fix. \nIntel also introduced new Xeon D-1500 chips for networking and storage gear that require quicker turnover of processed data. The chips integrate 10-gigabit ethernet controllers and have a technology called QuickAssist to drive throughput of compressed data up to 40Gbps (bits per second).
