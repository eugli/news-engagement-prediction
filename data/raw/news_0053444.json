Since welcoming the St. Jude Thanks and Giving campaign into our stores and online four years ago, Best Buy has helped raise nearly $40 million. \n“Our customers and employees care deeply about supporting research and treatment for childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Thanks to them, we are humbled to be able to present more than $18.2 million to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital,” said Paula Baker, Best Buy’s chief human resources officer. “We’re grateful for the generosity and passion of our customers and employees during the holiday season.” \nThis year’s Best Buy contribution makes a difference. The $18.2 million can run the hospital for more than a week. It can also be used for 12,000 days of chemotherapy, or 3,600 days of intensive care costs. Every dollar donated by customers and employees helps St. Jude remain a leader in the global effort to research, treat and defeat childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. \n“Best Buy’s support is nothing short of extraordinary and allows our doctors and scientists to continue our lifesaving work,” said Marlo Thomas, National Outreach Director for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. \"Funds raised as a result of Best Buy’s commitment and participation in the St. Jude Thanks and Giving campaign help ensure no family ever receives a bill from St. Jude for anything – not for treatment, travel, housing or food, because all a family should worry about is helping their child live.” \nAbout St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital: \nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is leading the way the world understands, treats and defeats childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. It is the only National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center devoted solely to children. Treatments invented at St. Jude have helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20 percent to 80 percent since the hospital opened more than 50 years ago. St. Jude is working to drive the overall survival rate for childhood cancer to 90 percent, and we won’t stop until no child dies from cancer. St. Jude freely shares the discoveries it makes, and every child saved at St. Jude means doctors and scientists worldwide can use that knowledge to save thousands more children. Families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food – because all a family should worry about is helping their child live.
