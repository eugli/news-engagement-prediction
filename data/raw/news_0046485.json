Based on the disjointed presser Thursday afternoon, Trump is now aware his Russian pals are fearlessly tapping US networks while we are embroiled in his needless Kremlin quagmire. Is he planning on at least taking a symbolic position against it, or is he still too busy whining about losing the popular vote to even notice? \nA Russian intelligence ship has been spotted off the coast of Groton, Connecticut, where Naval Submarine Base New London is located, U.S. defense officials said. The ship, approximately 30 miles from the U.S. naval base, is still in international waters. \nOriginally, I had asked rhetorically, why can’t we make the life of that spy crew miserable by buzzing it with US aircrafts, or escorting it everywhere with big nasty warships? Why don’t we just jam and blind the shit out of it it with US technical know-how? Then I watched the press conference and realized we can’t do anything subtle, we can’t risk actions with a defined but fragile margin of error and unforgiving consequences if that margin is exceeded, because we have an overhyped, pampered trust-fund doofus in the hotseat who could plunge the country and much of the world into recession, depression, or maybe even extinction, with the click of a mouse in the midst of a routine pique while surfing the Internet. If there were a Pulitzer Prize for best written single paragraphs by political observers, these would surely be in the running: \nCNN — Donald Trump has benefited from leaks more than the CEO of Depends. So forgive me if I am unpersuaded by Trump's complaints about them. \nUSA Today — If you start firing people for lying, for purveying fake news, for making U.S. foreign policy before you take office, for possibly having financial ties to Russia and possibly being vulnerable to blackmail by Russia, for being investigated by U.S. intelligence agencies — well. Where will it stop? Well, at least some science goes on: To poop where no man has pooped before: \nOn Wednesday morning, NASA rewarded five members of the public — two doctors, a dentist, an engineer and a product designer — for their creative ideas for how to poop in a spacesuit. Yes, it sounds a little bit funny. But unmet toilet needs could have life or death consequences for an astronaut in an emergency situation. Yes, there really is a move afoot by the usual suspects to eliminate the EPA : \nThe bill ... doesn’t bother with anything like wondering what happens to the data the agency collects, or the enforcement the agency carries out. It doesn’t sweat the details of employees or contracts. There’s nothing about what happens to the Clean Air Act, or the Clean Water Act, or the Endangered Species Act, or … anything at all. \nJust ‘terminated.’ We end on yet another disappointing note : \nThe man tipped as frontrunner for the role of science adviser to Donald Trump has described climate scientists as “a glassy-eyed cult” in the throes of a form of collective madness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:04:34.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
