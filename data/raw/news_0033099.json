See listing below. Credit Scott Shaw Our guide to dance performances. ANNA AZRIELI at the Chocolate Factory Theater (Feb. 22-25, 8 p.m.). Ms. Azrieli’s latest evening-length work, “Mirror Furor,” deals with echoes, repetitions and mirror images, yet the cast she has assembled is anything but symmetrical in age and experience: The group of four includes a dancer (Eleanor Smith), an actor (Massimiliano Balduzzi), a child (Ezra Azrieli Holzman) and the choreographer. Duets rupture into solos or evolve into trios, until everyone dances together. 866-811-4111, chocolatefactorytheater.org DANCEROULETTE at Roulette (through Feb. 18, 8 p.m.). The dancer Jennifer Lafferty organizes the latest edition of this series spotlighting experimental choreographers, a sampling of what’s new in contemporary dance. Each program features three or four artists offering work in various stages of development. The final two nights feature Heather Lang, Marilyn Maywald Yahel and a collaboration between Netta Yerushalmy and Marc Crousillat on Friday and Melanie Maar, EmmaGrace Skove-Epes and Tatyana Tenenbaum on Saturday. 917-267-0368, roulette.org MARGUERITE HEMMINGS at Gibney Dance: Agnes Varis Performing Arts Center (Feb. 23-24, 8 p.m.; Feb. 25, 5 and 8 p.m.). Ms. Hemmings channels her knowledge of street and social dances, hip-hop, and dancehall into the multimedia work “We Free,” presented as part of Gibney Dance’s Making Space series. The ever-evolving project at once celebrates and critiques the millennial generation’s relationship to freedom, exploring how the quest to be free plays out through music, dance and social media. Ms. Hemmings works with a wide network of collaborators; this iteration of “We Free” features the singer and multi-instrumentalist Solo Woods, the artist D.J. Blkwyntr and the interdisciplinary performer Arielle Rosales. 646-837-6809, gibneydance.org BENJAMIN KIMITCH at St. Mark’s Church in-the-Bowery (Feb. 23-25, 8 p.m.). For “Ko-bu,” his new work presented by Danspace Project, Mr. Kimitch draws on his background in Chinese folk and classical dance, which he studied while growing up in Minneapolis. A solo for the dancer Julie McMillan, the work takes inspiration from Buddhist iconography and Maurice Sendak illustrations, among other sources, reflecting on grief, loss and solitude through a precise use of stillness. While thinking about imagery dating to fourth-century China, Mr. Kimitch also explored the Western classical music canon, in particular the final works of Charles Ives, Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler; “Ko-bu” is set to Ives’s Orchestral Set No. 3. 866-811-4111, danspaceproject.org JOSÉ MAYA at Schimmel Center (Feb. 17, 7:30 p.m.). This commanding Spanish dancer brings his program “Latente: A Flamenco Journey” to Pace University for one night only. Flamenco dance and music are richly intertwined, and Mr. Maya has assembled a group whose talents blend seamlessly, with his own robust dancing at the core. He’ll be joined by the singers Juana la del Pipa, Enrique el Extremeño and Manuel Tañé as well as the guitarist Pino Losada. As introspective as he is impulsive, he describes “Latente” as “a personal, inward search, an intimate journey where I discover the source of my instinct.” 212-346-1715, schimmelcenter.org The Listings It’s a big city and there’s lots to do.

Koch Theater (through Feb. 26). After four more performances of Peter Martins’s “The Sleeping Beauty” (Friday through Sunday), the company enters the homestretch of its winter season with a selection of works by Jerome Robbins, one of its founding choreographers. That program (Tuesday and Thursday) includes the bracing “Glass Pieces,” driven by the repetitive structures of its Philip Glass score; “Moves,” a ballet in silence; and “The Concert (or, The Perils of Everybody),” a comedy set at a piano recital. Wednesday brings a trio of Broadway-inspired ballets danced to the music of Richard Rodgers, including Balanchine’s “Slaughter on Tenth Avenue.” 212-496-0600, nycballet.com A version of this article appears in print on February 17, 2017, on Page C28 of the New York edition .
