Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nLooking back, Wednesday’s news was dominated by 1) GOP town halls crowded with protesters testifying they face certain death without Obamacare, despite having lived decades with no inkling they needed it; and 2) a revival of the transgender bathroom argument that captivated the nation during Obama’s second term. \nJust for fun, here’s a flashback to Barack Obama at a town hall of his own claiming he’d never made a big deal out of transgender bathrooms — after having his attorney general issued a directive to every public school in the nation. Pres denies he made transgender bathroom choice an issue. Agrees \"there are a lot of things that are more pressing.\" pic.twitter.com/I4XyMJ3vKK \n— Mark Knoller (@markknoller) June 2, 2016 \nToday’s big development was President Trump reversing Obama’s directive. The statement is well worth reading as inoculation against any hysteria making the rounds on social media and cable news panels.

BREAKING: Trump administration rescinds guidance addressing how Title IX education law protects transgender students. #StandWithGavin \n— ACLU National (@ACLU) February 23, 2017 \nOMG, everybody panic! The Trump administration does not have the authority to undo legal protections for transgender students. #StandWithGavin pic.twitter.com/tlJHbqKyNV \n— ACLU National (@ACLU) February 23, 2017 \nWon’t somebody think of the transgender students in crisis? Oh, wait, one more thing. President Trump's revocation of the guidance, however, does NOT undo legal protections for transgender students. #StandWithGavin \n— ACLU National (@ACLU) February 23, 2017 Trending UH-OH!

Until then, it might be comforting to think back to the progress made under the Obama administration. \nRemember how awesome it was when some woke staffer in 2015 realized the White House itself didn’t have transgender restrooms, so they slapped a sign outside a restroom in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building? That was written up by CNN, and the Guardian, and the Independent, and POLITICO, and ABC News, and Fox News, and NBC News, and Reuters, and the Christian Science Monitor, and everyone else, essentially. \nHere’s a photo so the American people who couldn’t be there in person to genuflect and maybe duck in to pee can always remember. Snapped this at White House in Oct. I remember thinking at time it was nice reminder of the steady march of progress. pic.twitter.com/peoKZPFHH4 \n— Susan Hennessey (@Susan_Hennessey) February 22, 2017 @Susan_Hennessey I wonder if that sign is still there… \n— Maruel Priddy (@MartinPribble) February 22, 2017 @Susan_Hennessey Odds that it is still there? \n— Arlen Parsa (@automaki) February 22, 2017 @Susan_Hennessey @bonniegrrl Glad you caught it before it was ripped off the wall! \n— Carol Demcak (@CarolDemcak) February 23, 2017 \nWhere is the sign now?
