It's a very unique colour,\" grower Gavin Scurr, from Wamuran, north of Brisbane, said. \n\"They are a similar size and shape to Kensington Prides, however externally they are purple rather than yellow.\" \nThe flesh of the mango is still the usual yellow and orange colour. A mango flavour 'the rest of the world enjoys' \nIt is known more formally as the princess mango, and was bred in South Africa using mango varieties from Central America. \n\"The flavour is more like an American mango, so it has a bit more of 'turpy' type taste,\" Mr Scurr said. \n\"The ones I have tried have a lot of flavour, but it is different to what we are used to in Australia. \n\"It's just a more mango flavour that the rest of the world enjoys. \n\"It's actually got a fibreless flesh, so it's very smooth, so similar to a nectarine or a peach on the inside, so very easy on the palate.\" \nHowever, do not expect the princess mango to be replacing the Kensington Pride, Australia's most popular mango variety, anytime soon.

(ABC News: Jonathan Hair) \n\"By being visually different, people identify they're not Kensington Pride and they certainly taste nothing like Kensington Prides,\" Mr Scurr said. \n\"But I don't think they will take the place of KPs. However, later in the season when there are no KPs, this will be a viable alternative.\" \nMr Scurr's company, Piñata Farms, owns the commercial rights to the princess mango in Australia, and has been growing it for three years. \nPiñata Farms will give this year's crop to its existing customers to trial, but the future of the new mango in Australia comes down to the all-important taste test. \n\"Ultimately it comes down to taste. If people like them we will continue to grow them,\" Mr Scurr said. \n\"But if the flavour doesn't excite Australian consumers then it probably doesn't have a big future. \n\"If it proves a viable proposition to commercialise it, we will be asking other growers if they're interested in growing it.\" Mangoes for nine months of the year \nAustralia's mango season begins around August and September in the Northern Territory and usually wraps up in southern states around March or April, where late season varieties are grown. \nHowever, Mr Scurr said the princess mango could help to extend the season by an extra month. \n\"Potentially this variety could go through to April, or May further south,\" he said. \n\"Ten years ago most of the season was finished by Christmas, whereas now we push well into February, through extension of new growing regions and varieties. \n\"So if we can get mangoes for nine months of the year for Aussie consumers, I think that's fantastic.\" Photo: The princess mango was bred in South Africa, using varieties from Central America. (ABC News: Jonathan Hair) Southern states could grow maroon mango \nThe princess mango could also mean southern states like South Australia get the chance to grow the popular summer fruit. \nSouth Africa sits between the 34th parallel south and the Tropic of Capricorn, as does New South Wales and parts of Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. \nThe princess mango was bred for those conditions, meaning it could also be adapted to suit southern Australian climates. \n\"South Africa is well south of the tropic of Capricorn, like we are here in south Queensland, so if it grows well there then it potentially will here,\" Mr Scurr said. \n\"In frost-free areas in Victoria and South Australia, it might have a place there too. \n\"However, as you push further south it is the winter that knocks mangoes around. They don't like it, and anything below 15 degrees mangos start stressing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:15:28.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
