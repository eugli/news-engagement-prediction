Continuing to build momentum for the stretch run, the Hawks concluded their six-game road trip by settling one more score — beating the Edmonton Oilers 5-1 in workman-like fashion Saturday night at Rogers Place for their fifth consecutive victory. Richard Panik scored two goals and Patrick Kane, Trevor van Riemsdyk and Artem Anisimov each had one as the Hawks completed an impressive 5-1 road trip. The Hawks (35-17-5) head into their bye week three points behind the Central Division-leading Minnesota Wild, who have three games in hand and three home games this week against the Red Wings, Ducks and Stars while the Hawks are idle. Their next game is Saturday against the Oilers at the United Center. “It seemed like we got better and better over the last five games,” defenseman Duncan Keith said. “It’s a lot more of the team game we’re going to need going forward. I think we’re starting to show some of our potential.” \nBlackhawks center Jonathan Toews is stopped by Oilers goalie Cam Talbot (33) as defenseman Andrej Sekera (2) and defenseman Matt Benning (83) assist Talbot in the Hawks 5-1 victory Saturday night at Rogers Place.

They snapped an eight-game regular-season losing streak to the Wild on Wednesday and a four-game losing streak to the Jets on Friday. This time the Hawks (35-17-5) were motivated to atone for one of their worst games of the season — a 5-0 loss to the Oilers on Nov. 21. And they did it impressively in the second game of a back-to-back against Oilers team that was coming off its bye week. “I liked our trip,” coach Joel Quenneville said. “That was probably the best four-line rotation we’ve had in any stretch all year long. Our defense was excellent. [Scott Darling] was great in the net. Talk about any of the last five games, it’s all positive — all good situations whether it’s special teams or a big line, or blocking shots, doing whatever you can in all situations. It was good to see. We’re definitely improving our team game. It’s tough to win five games on the road.” Kane (goal, two assists) scored three points to jump to fourth in the league scoring race with 58 points (19 goals, 39 assists). Panik (two goals, one assist) also had three points. And Jonathan Toews had two assists as the Hawks’ top two lines were effective throughout. Brent Seabrook had four blocked shots to give him 10 in the past two games. Anisimov, who scored his 20th goal of the season, also blocked four shots as the Hawks played a complete game for the second consecutive night. Darling overcame a shaky start to stop 30-of-31 shots for the victory. “We’ve been playing some good hockey. I thought the guys played great tonight,” Darling said. “[The Oilers are] a super-talented team, a lot of skill and they came out flying and we weathered the storm and took over the game. We had some great goals, some great plays and 200-foot hockey to help give me an easier night.” After opening the road trip with a 3-1 loss to the Sharks — allowing two more third-period goals — the Hawks were on a three-game losing streak with five road games remaining. But they responded with hard-fought victories against the Coyotes (4-3), Stars (5-3), Wild (4-3 in overtime) and Jets (5-2) before cruising to a rare no-sweat victory over Oilers. It was only the seventh time this season the Hawks have not been in a one-goal game in the third period. The Hawks fell behind early against the Oilers, but responded quickly. Just 4:01 into the game, Oilers’ forward Patrick Maroon beat Darling in front of the net off a nice feed from Connor McDavid — who stole the puck from Niklas Hjalmarsson. The Hawks tied it 1:48 later when Panik beat Cam Talbot with a wrist shot from the high slot for a 1-1 tie. Kane gave the Hawks a 2-1 lead with a power-play goal when he shot the puck from behind the net off Talbot’s skate at 9:54. Van Riemsdyk scored unassisted and Panik scored a power-play goal on a rebound in front to give the Hawks a 4-1 lead in the second period. Anismov added a gritty goal in front of the net to give the Hawks a 5-1 lead in the third period. “It was a good response all three games,” Quenneville said, referring to the victories over the Wild, Jets and Oilers. “Certainly happy the way we’re going into the break. Everybody should enjoy the break, knowing that we set a nice standard going into it.” Previously from Sports ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:11:36.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
