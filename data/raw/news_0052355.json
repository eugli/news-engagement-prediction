The vast majority of foreigners - mainly from other Arab or Asian countries - use the public service for heavily subsidised fees. Employers generally pay an annual health insurance fee of 50 dinars (£129) per worker per year. \nRead more Kuwait denies 'Muslim ban' story promoted by Donald Trump Kuwait swelters in what could be highest temperature ever recorded Oil kingdoms call out Hillary Clinton’s claims they 'fund' terrorism Around 70 per cent of Kuwait’s total population - 2.9 million of 4.2 million people - is thought to be foreign born. \n“[Migrant labourers] were granted their workers’ visa. They deserve to be treated with dignity,” Dr. Yousef al-Muhanna, a 34-year old general surgeon, told the Associated Press.\nThe discrimination goes against the Hippocratic Oath, he went on. “We are not supposed to look at their passports – we are supposed to deal with their medical conditions,” the doctor added.\nIn 2016 it was reported that hospitals and clinics in Jahra and Kuwait City had banned foreigners from using non-emergency services.\nThe health care moves are just the latest in a string of government-sanctioned steps designed to prioritise the rights and well-being of Kuwaiti citizens at the expense of foreign-born residents of the country.\nLast April Kuwait’s parliament passed legislation increasing the price of electricity and water in all residential buildings which did not apply to Kuwaiti nationals.\nKuwait: suicide attack kills many in mosque Discriminatory measures such as mass deportations without hearings or trials beforehand are common. In April 2013, Thekra al-Rashidi, the then labour minister, announced plans to deport around 100,000 expatriates each year for the next decade in order to reduce the number of foreigners living in the emirate by one million. \nOther recent changes to the law mean that foreign workers must meet a monthly salary requirement in order to stay in the country, and be resident for two years before being able to get a driving licence.\nForeigners are increasingly blamed for Kuwait’s social ills as a way to deflect blame from the authorities, said Hind Francis, an analyst at the Rai Institute think tank.\n“Many big problems that concern the public are blamed on the expatriates: congested roads, overcrowded hospitals, many areas in which public policy has failed,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:43:28.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
