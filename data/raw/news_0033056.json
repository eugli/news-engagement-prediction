The girl’s 56-year-old grandmother, Shirley Robinson, was treated for a gunshot wound to her leg. \n“That was a 7-year-old child, innocent. We were lying in the bed sleeping. What are we doing 4 or 5 o’clock in the morning? We’re in here sleeping,” Robinson told local CBS affiliate WBTV. \nA’yanna was shot in her head, torso and extremities, according to an autopsy report recently obtained by local media . Though the second-grader had 20 wounds, that doesn’t mean she was shot 20 times, since a single bullet may have caused both entry and exit wounds. \n“She was my joy, she was my everything,” Robinson said. “No matter where she go, she had to go home and be with Grandma, and that was my heart.” \nRobinson has already faced a family tragedy. A’yanna’s father, Antonio Allen , was shot to death on Christmas day in 2009. \nMore than two months after A’yanna’s death, no one has been arrested. The Salisbury Police Department did not immediately return requests for comment on Wednesday. If you hear something, tell it, because I need closure for A’yanna. Shirley Robinson, A'yanna Allen's grandmother \nAuthorities are offering a $20,000 reward for any information that leads to an arrest. Tips can be submitted to the Salisbury Police department or Crime Stoppers online or at 1-866-639-5245. \nRobinson, speaking to Fox 46 News this month, begged the public to help find her granddaughter’s killer. \n“I know y’all know something, tell something. If you hear something, tell it, because I need closure for A’yanna,” she said.
