BEN STRANG Last updated 15:14, February 23 2017 REUTERS \nDan Carter admitted to making a big mistake, and fans lapped it up. \nOPINION: In 2015, 90 people died in crashes involving drunk or drugged up drivers on New Zealand roads. \nFrom what I can tell, nobody died as a result of two consenting adults doing whatever they did in one of New Zealand's disabled toilets. \nNot that you'd know it, from the reaction to All Blacks legend Dan Carter being caught drink driving in France. PHOTOSPORT \nAaron Smith made a far less serious error of judgement and was slammed. \nIt's a classic Kiwi double standard. If alcohol is involved, it's one of those things. \nREAD MORE: \n\nCarter was clocked at nearly double the legal limit by French police, an action that endangered those around him. \nPut it this way. After one beer, some people show the same reduction in cognitive ability as someone who has suffered a concussion. \nI'd know. I ran World Rugby's concussion protocols on a bunch of inebriated journalists, and they failed miserably, even after drinking just half a beer. Ad Feedback \nYou aren't allowed to operate machinery with a concussion, so why you'd drive after drinking is anybody's guess. \nThere is real science out there, too. Science showing the likelihood of crashing depending on the amount of alcohol in one's system. \nCarter, at 0.98mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, was about 30 times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than if he was alcohol free. \nThose are sobering numbers. \nAnd yet, the public reaction to his actions have been to almost brush it off. \nHis misdemeanour can be put down to an \"error of judgement\" or a \"life lesson\". If it involves alcohol, us Kiwis don't seem to think it's that serious. \n\"Man, don't beat yourself up about it,\" one Facebook commenter told Carter, and I'm paraphrasing here. \"It was a mistake. You are a Kiwi legendâ€¦\" \nRewind four months, and All Blacks halfback Aaron Smith was caught popping into the loo with a consenting woman. She happened to not be his partner. \nCue outrage. \nSmith was \"disgusting\", and his partner \"deserves better than you\". Some suggested he should never play for the All Blacks again. \nOne media outlet even went to the toilet in question and provided us with a video of the scene. \nWe need to get our priorities straight. \nDon't get me wrong. Smith's actions saw him lose a whole ton of respect, and rightly so. \nBut Carter could have killed someone and we just shrug it off? \nIn 2016, 25,298 people were nabbed for what the police call \"alcohol specific offences\". That is a whopping 69 people per day throughout the country done for drink driving. \nNearly 30 per cent of all fatal crashes involve alcohol or drugs. That number is far too high. \nBut, hey, we all make mistakes, right. Don't beat yourselves up about it. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:50:32.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
