Credit Jean Chung for The New York Times For the men’s team, they recruited several North Americans playing on one of the three South Korea-based teams in the Asia League. They offered naturalization to a handful of players from the United States and Canada — none of whom have any Korean ancestry. Mike Testwuide, a Colorado native, was approached by the national team coach, Jim Paek, a two-time Stanley Cup champion with the Pittsburgh Penguins, during his second season with Anyang Halla of the Asia League. On a men’s squad that includes players with a wide range of abilities, Testwuide, a strapping 6-foot-5 center out of Colorado College, offers the big, physical presence in short supply here. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The prospect of joining the Olympic fraternity thrilled the 30-year-old Testwuide. But it took him a week to agree to become the first men’s hockey player to become a dual citizen of the United States and the Republic of Korea. That was how long he needed to gauge his comfort level with two prospects: Could he hold his right hand over his heart during the playing of a national anthem that was not “The Star-Spangled Banner” and not feel like an impostor — or a traitor? And how would one of the world’s most homogeneous cultures react to a towering, pale-skinned forward representing them on the world stage? “There’s a lot of negativity out there,” Testwuide said. “In the U.S. it was like, ‘Why would you want to play for another country?’” He added, “And in Korea it’s like, ‘Why are we bringing you guys in?’” The naturalization process took roughly a month, Testwuide said, and included memorizing the Korean national anthem. It took considerably longer for him to feel comfortable in his dual role as hockey ringer and proselytizer of puck.

Brickler, 26, was invited to a national training camp in South Korea during his senior year at SUNY Geneseo and signed out of college with the Asia League, his interest whetted by the possibility of an Olympic berth. “It is a very weird situation for me, for sure,” Brickler said before a home game in February in the northern Seoul suburb of Goyang. “Playing in North America, I was sometimes considered the Asian player on the team, but when I came out here I’m considered the American.” He added, “I might not look it fully or speak it, but no one can take away the fact that I have Korean blood from my mother.” Marissa Brandt, who played at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minn., will be a defenseman on the women’s team, whose roster is about 20 percent North American. She was born in South Korea and adopted by an American family. “When I was in the States, I didn’t want to be Korean, I wanted to be like everyone else,” she said. In the summer of 2015, she traveled to Korea for the first time since her adoption to attend a hockey camp and was transformed.

The United States in the same period had more than 500,000. The defenseman Donku Lee, a national-team member who plays with Testwuide on Anyang Halla, was blunt in his assessment of the challenge facing the South Koreans in Pyeongchang. “The other teams will be fighting with tanks and the Koreans will be using wooden sticks,” Lee said. There has been marked progress. The women’s team recently beat Thailand, 20-0, in the Asian Winter Games and lost, 3-0, to Japan — a respectable result after losing its previous six meetings to Japan by a combined score of 103-1, according to local news reports. And at the Division I Group A World Championships last year, the men scored their first victory against Japan, a 3-0 shutout. The sport still operates largely in a vacuum in a country that is crazy for speed skating and figure skating. At a coffee house two blocks from Anyang Halla’s rink, a longtime resident, huddled at a table with two friends, looked up from his hot drink with a confused expression when asked about the local hockey team. What hockey team? he asked. Continue reading the main story Photo Marissa Brandt, center, a defenseman on the national women’s team, was born in South Korea and adopted by an American family.

Credit Tim Gruber for The New York Times “There’s a lot of people in Korea who aren’t as educated about the game; they don’t really know what we’re up against,” said Testwuide, who signed an entry-level contract with the Philadelphia Flyers and played for the Adirondack Phantoms and Abbotsford Heat of the American Hockey League before moving to Korea. “They think, ‘We brought you guys in here so we can compete with Canada,’ and that’s where it’s hard. I could barely make an N.H.L. lineup. The reality of it is one of Team Canada’s player salaries is probably the entire budget we have for players’ salaries and everything for the Olympic run.” The Korea Ice Hockey Association has a four-year, $20 million plan to accelerate the development of its men’s and women’s national teams. The imports, as the North American men are commonly called, feel an urgency to make the national team more competitive on the world stage. It is a challenge complicated by cultural mores as foreign as the Korean alphabet to the North Americans, who recognize that Koreans do not like to lose, especially by lopsided scores that could cause chemyeon, or loss of face. That’s a particular concern to the men’s team, which opens preliminary play against two-time defending champion Canada. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “It’s such a young hockey country,” said Matt Dalton, the Canadian-born goaltender who plays for Anyang Halla. “Anything they can put their hat on, they try to use it to further momentum. Like when we beat Japan once and people were like, ‘We’re better now.’ When I hear something like that, my first instinct is, ‘Guys, let’s not get too high here.’” The Goyang Ice Rink, where Brickler’s High 1 team plays some of its home games, had fewer than 300 fans in the 3,400-capacity arena before a recent game, held during the first major snowstorm of the winter. The crowd — and the noise — was bolstered by a group of 100 High 1 jersey-clad fans, mostly team employees who performed continuous card stunts. They tirelessly raised squares of colored paper to form messages like “We Will Win” while a man pounded on a drum.

The women were Swift’s mother and aunt, visiting from rural Ontario, Canada, where Swift was reared. Swift’s mother, Darlene, was asked when her son last played a competitive game in front of so few people. “I don’t think he ever has,” she said. Swift, 29, is a 5-foot-9 center with a sting, quick to throw a check. His physical style of play has no translation in Korea, where hard hits remain a largely foreign concept. Even if the body is willing, Korean players said, the mind is inclined to think twice because of an age-based team hierarchy that frowns on a younger player checking an elder. The North Americans have heard stories of a Korean forced to pay a postgame visit to the opponents’ dressing room to apologize for a crushing hit delivered to an older player. The hits are less likely to come from hips than sticks, which are sometimes wielded like swords. Swift said his body had not taken a beating in the Asia League, but his face had. He smiled to reveal a few missing front teeth. Sarah Murray, the Canadian-born women’s coach who won two national titles playing at the University of Minnesota-Duluth, said communication posed her biggest challenge. “Sometimes players look scared when I talk to them,” said Murray, whose father, Andy, coached in the N.H.L. “There’s so much I want to say to them, and I do want to have a very personal relationship with my players. Sometimes it’s hard to say with someone else saying it for you.” Murray confronted one cultural barrier that was easier to surmount. When she first arrived in Korea, she was taken aback to see that her players did not know how to hop over the boards from the bench onto the ice. “They always used the door,” she said. “They were literally running into each other coming off and going on.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story For the men and the women, progress has come slowly, yet expectations will be lofty. “I love being an underdog,” Murray said. “That’s what I want at the Olympics. Nobody knows what to expect. I would love to shock people.” \nSu Hyun Lee and Jean Chung contributed reporting.
