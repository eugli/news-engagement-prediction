It happened to one Flint, Michigan teenager, who immediately drove away — but her warning to others about the incident has quickly gone viral. Ashley Hardacre, 19, wrote on Facebook earlier this month that after leaving her mall job late one night and getting into her car, she noticed a flannel shirt on her windshield . She tried to get it off with her wipers, but it was wrapped tightly around one of the blades. Sensing something was wrong — and seeing two cars parked nearby, one that was running — she says she drove away with the shirt still attached to her car. LOOK OUT! Michigan teen warns about a 'kidnapping tactic' #AshleyHardacre @nypdnews https://t.co/poQWxb3qNV pic.twitter.com/RkRzZ8dVhL — NY Daily News Video (@NYDNVideo) February 22, 2017 “I had seen posts lately about people finding things under their windshield wipers in the Burton/Flint area as an attempt to get girls out of their cars and distracted,” she wrote in a since-deleted Facebook post . “Luckily I knew better than to remove the shirt with cars around me, so I drove over to a place where I was safe and quickly rolled down my window and got the shirt off.” Local police told CBS News that they contacted Hardacre after seeing her post, but that they haven’t received any similar reports. “Nothing like this has ever happened before,” Flint Township Police Detective Sergeant Brad Wangler said. “There have been no other incidences like this. It’s kind of unknown as to what or why or who [did this].” Young woman’s Facebook post about meaning of shirt left on windshield goes viral: https://t.co/hOMWkfxaxI pic.twitter.com/V0mjcq9rpq — Women in the World (@WomenintheWorld) February 23, 2017 Before deleting it, Hardacre’s Facebook post had more than 106,000 shares, 15,000 likes, and nearly 9,000 comments. “I posted about the incident to inform others that it can happen to anyone and that they shouldn’t fall for it,” Hardacre told CBS. “A lot of people think it is fake or it won’t happen to them. But you can never be too safe.” We might never know whether or not Hardacre was truly in danger, but one thing’s for sure — a stranger’s shirt wrapped around your wiper blade is straight up creepy . So you might want to be like Ashley and drive away if something like this happens to you.
