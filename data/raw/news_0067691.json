The fog is expected to dissipate by mid-morning, Environment Canada says. ( Carlos Osorio/Toronto Star ) By Alina Bykova Staff Reporter Wed., Feb. 22, 2017 \nEnvironment Canada has issued a fog advisory for much of the GTA, including Toronto, Hamilton and the regions of Peel, Halton, York and Durham. \nAccording to a statement released by the weather agency around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday, the fog may cause severely reduced or near-zero visibility in some areas, which may make the morning commute hazardous. \n“The visibility will improve by mid morning as the dense fog dissipates,” the statement said. \nWednesday’s temperature is expected to peak at 13 C, the forecaster says, breaking the 1981 record of 11.8 C. The overnight low will be 9 C with a 40 per cent chance of showers. \nThursday may have a high of 16 C, once again breaking the 14.9 C record set on Feb. 23, 1984. The overnight temperature will dip down to 3 C with a 30 per cent chance of rain. Article Continued Below \nThe warm streak is expected to continue until the weekend. Friday is expected to have a high of 9 C with a 60 per cent chance of showers and a nightly low of 7 C with rain in the forecast. \nSaturday will also be rainy with a high of 12 C, but that’s when the warm weather is expected to end. Saturday’s overnight will be -4 C with a 60 per cent chance of flurries, Environment Canada predicts. \nSunday’s forecast high is 2 C and the overnight low is expected to hit -6 C. \nThe balmy weather we’ve been enjoying this week is the result of a warm air flow from the south, according to Environment Canada meteorologist Geoff Coulson. \nThis time of year, Coulson said, the air flow comes predominantly from the north or north west, and is much colder, but the flow mass shifted last Friday, bringing in warm air from the south. \nSaturday morning may feel mild as a result of lingering warm air, but as it begins to dissipate and cold air moves in, the weekend will feel significantly colder. \nDespite the change, weekend temperatures will still be a few degrees above the seasonal average, which normally hovers around the 0 C mark.
