Ken Fisher and his wife Ednamae at the UI Stead Family Children’s Hospital open house \nBut the guy who looks like a fun grandpa—and he is—also, by all accounts, is an excellent leader, who has guided UI Health Care though some pretty tough financial waters in the past 10 years. Now, he says it’s time for him to move on—to retirement, which will include settling into a new home in North Carolina, some travel, and oh, maybe a little consulting. Ken’s official retirement date is July 1, 2017. \n“It has truly been my privilege and honor to work in this enterprise. I have been in the health care financial management world for more than 45 years and worked a lot of places, but UI Health Care is really a special, amazing place,” Fisher says. \nWhen he says he worked a lot of places, he isn’t kidding. He came to UI Health Care from Charlotte, North Carolina, where he was a director for Navigant Consulting Inc., and prior to that held financial positions at Grace Hospital in Detroit; East Tennessee Baptist Hospital in Knoxville, Tennessee; Presbyterian Hospital, Charlotte Memorial Hospital, and Carolinas Hospital and Health Service, all in Charlotte, North Carolina. At the time, he came to UI Health Care to serve as interim chief financial officer and a consultant; he wasn’t really thinking about staying in Iowa City. But, a funny thing happened . . . the people got to him. \n“From the staff, to faculty, to administration, it has been a pleasure working with everyone. It helps that the leadership has had such a strong vision, and there are so many good people who understand how to work together in teams. We’ve faced a lot of challenges, but we have done it together and we have pulled through.” \nMany of Ken’s staff members and colleagues credit him for being one of the “good people” too, which they say is key to his success as a leader and mentor. \n“Ken is a very genuine and generous person. He truly cares about the people who work with him and knows it takes a strong team to successfully manage this enterprise. This has been critical in his efforts to build an integrated team of professionals that manage the finances of our enterprise,” according to Mark Hingtgen, assistant vice president of finance, and assistant CFO. Mollie Claire having fun with grandma and grandpa \nTammi Craft agrees, noting that Ken “trusts and allows those who report to him to do their jobs, and always recognizes and encourages people to nourish their professional and personal lives.” Now retired herself, Tammi was the director of Health Information Management and says, “I think UI Health Care was fortunate to find him and keep him here this long. He has helped us avoid some of the pitfalls of other health care organizations.” That’s how Mark Henrichs and others see it too, earning Ken an interesting nickname. “Ken’s leadership is evident in everything he does. His wealth of knowledge about financial issues and non-financial issues is appreciated by all. Given his gift of insight, he is often referred to as ‘The Most Interesting Man in the World,’” says Henrichs, assistant vice president of finance, and assistant CFO. \nKen’s sunny nature and a penchant for work/life balance are other qualities appreciated by his staff, including Phil Roudabush, assistant VP of finance, Revenue Cycle Management and Patient Financial Services. “I cannot recall a day that Ken has not been positive and smiling. He is always available for a question or a conversation and would typically end by asking about family. He is a CFO with a remarkable caring nature.” \nColleagues like UI Physicians Chief Operating Officer Todd Patterson appreciate Ken’s passion for supporting the entire integrated enterprise and level-headed approach to making decisions. “He is one of the most competent people I have ever worked with,” Patterson notes. \nOthers outside the institution have taken note of Ken’s financial expertise and leadership skills, including Becker’s Hospital Review , which twice named him to its list of “150 Hospital and Health System CFOs to Watch”—in 2015 and again in 2016. And, in May 2016, he was named Financial Executive of the Year (government/education entity) by the Corridor Business Journal . \nWhile Ken’s accomplishments in the financial arena at UI Health Care have been many (see below), his staff and colleagues also cite his keen insight and advice in many different situations. \nAssociate Vice President for Legal Affairs Joe Clamon recalls receiving sage advice from Ken when Joe was beginning his role with UI Health Care in 2014. \n“Ken gave me two pieces of advice: listen and don’t be afraid to challenge assumptions. It was good advice that reflects his problem-solving, collaborative approach to his work. He often quietly listens and then in his quintessentially ‘Ken Fisher’ accent and with precise word choices asks a question that cuts to essence of the issue or changes the way you look at a situation,” Clamon says. Marnie (left) and Katie with their mom on the last day of chemo \nAh yes, Ken’s accent—a very light “Southern” accent that he never lost—even after ten years of living in Iowa. It is telltale of where he spent most of his young life, Texas, including attending Baylor University and graduating in 1968. He was drafted into the U.S. Army and spent 14 months in Seoul Korea before returning to Dallas, where he met his wife Ednamae in 1970. She had just been hired as the Music Associate and Organist at Wilshire Baptist Church after graduating from Oklahoma Baptist University. Ken was singing in the choir. \n“We had our first date Labor Day weekend, I proposed 10 days later, and we were married the Friday after Thanksgiving in 1970. Ednamae has been my partner and the joy of my life for these last 46 years. Every time we moved for my career she had to start over with a new house and one of the most exciting times was in Iowa when our home was featured in Room Magazine . \n“She also had to restart her music career. Over the years she has been an organist in 10 different churches, started 5 handbell choirs, was a director of music, started or rebuilt many children’s music programs for churches, taught piano, was a church secretary, and always a full-time mother for our kids,” Ken said. \nLike Ken, Ednamae also came to love Iowa. She made many new friends and most of all, when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, the community of friends and health care professionals who cared for her in that difficult time still remain close and will for life. \nThe Fishers have two daughters, Marnie, 40, and Katie, 38. Marnie is a full-time minister working with youth through non-profit ministry in Birmingham, Alabama, and married to Daniel who also works for the same ministry. They have one daughter, Mollie Claire, who is 9 and the Fishers’ first grandchild. Katie’s passion is her kids, Linus, 8, Harvey, 5, and husband Eric. Her love of politics gets her involved in many things including being PTA vice-president and social justice causes in the Cincinnati area. \nKen and Ednamae are looking forward to retiring in Black Mountain, North Carolina, a beautiful community in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Asheville where they are building a new home. In addition to visits from their daughters and grandkids, Ken says they have plans to “enjoy life” with some traveling, and another passion of theirs, fine wine and great food. “Ednamae loves to cook and has been to many cooking schools and even taken me along a few times.” \nBefore he leaves his UI Health Care post in July, there are still projects to complete, including completion of an operating and capital budget for FY18. “I will also be working with Dr. Robillard to facilitate a transition plan after my retirement.” \nAsked for words of wisdom he lives by, he said, “Keep an eye on the future, but work hard today so that the future happens.” Some of Ken’s accomplishments during his UI Health Care career \nUI Health Care leaders and colleagues cite these below among Ken Fisher’s accomplishments during his service as associate vice president of finance, UI Health Care, and chief financial officer, UI Hospitals and Clinics. Integrating the financial management of the enterprise across the hospital and college, improving the entire budgeting and reporting processes, and bringing more transparency to the finances of UI Health Care. Managing to positive operating margins in 9 of past 10 years, when many other academic medical centers in the nation were struggling.
