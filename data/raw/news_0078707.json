But for the first time, British actors have ranked Dick Van Dyke ’s “mockney” as the worst attempt at a U.K. accent in a pool of the highest grossing films’ leads . \nLanguage-learning app Babbel commissioned ex-pat professional actors from both the UK and US to vote on a five-point scale on how convincing the accents were for leading parts in blockbusters grossing over $100 million. \nFor the United States accent, American Actors UK awarded British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor a 4.5/5 for his work as Solomon Northup in “12 Years a Slave.” Tied for second are the DC superheros; Christian Bale as Batman and Henry Cavill as Superman both garnered 4.2/5 scores. \nBest in show for the Americans attempting the over-the-pond accents, awarded by British Actors in LA, are Meryl Streep, Gwyneth Paltrow and Renée Zellweger. Streep’s Margaret Thatcher (4.9/5) in 2011’s “The Iron Lady” was so convincing that her performance earned her an Oscar nom for best actress. In “Shakespeare In Love,” Gwyneth Paltrow plays Shakespeare’s lover Viola de Lesseps, a role deserving of a 4.7/5 score (and an Oscar win). For the titular role of Bridget Jones in the 2001 film, the Oscar-nominated Zellweger was awarded a 4.5/5.

As bad as it sounds, Wilde “doubt[s] his score will come as a shock to him.” Van Dyke’s joked about the role for years. \nUnfortunately for “Twilight” fans, Robert Pattinson’s American accent in the franchise earned him a lesser 3.5/5. Even worse was Kate Winslet in “Titanic,” whose Philadelphian drawl only got a 2.4/5. \n“It was a bit difficult to see that Kate Winslet received such a low score of 2.4 out of 5, Wilde added. “Still, despite her lack of mastery, she gave a ravishing performance in one of the most iconic cinematic films of all time.” \nSee the full results below: \nBrits Playing Americans \nChiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup in “12 Years A Slave” (2013): 4.5 out of 5 Christian Bale as Batman in “The Dark Knight” (2008): 4.2 out of 5 Henry Cavill as Superman in “The Man Of Steel” (2013): 4.2 out of 5 Emma Watson in “Perks Of Being A Wallflower” (2012): 4.1 out of 5 Clive Owen in “Inside Man” (2006): 4.1 out of 5 Benedict Cumberbatch in “Doctor Strange” (2016): 3.9 out of 5 John Boyega in “Star Wars The Force Awakens” (2015): 3.7 out of 5 Rosamund Pike in “Gone Girl” (2014): 3.5 out of 5 Robert Pattinson in the Twilight franchise: 3.5 out of 5 Kate Winslet in “Titanic” (1997): 2.4 out of 5 \nAmericans Playing Brits \nMeryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher in “The Iron Lady” (2011): 4.9 out of 5 Gwyneth Paltrow in “Shakespeare In Love” (1998): 4.7 out of 5 Renée Zellweger as the title character in “Bridget Jones’s Diary” (2011): 4.5 out of 5 Robert Downey Jr. as the titular British detective “Sherlock Holmes” (2009): 4.3 out of 5 Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee in The Lord of the Rings franchise: 3.8 out of 5 Natalie Portman as Evey in “V for Vendetta” (2005): 3.5 out of 5 Angelina Jolie, as the title character in “Maleficent” (2014): 3.3 out of 5 Johnny Depp in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise: 3.0 out of 5 Kevin Costner as the lead in “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves” (1991): 2.0 out of 5 Dick Van Dyke in “Mary Poppins” (1964): 1.6 out of 5 Filed Under:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:35:41.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
