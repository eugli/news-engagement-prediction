PUBLISHED: 14:45, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 | UPDATED: 15:07, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 BPNS Mrs Childs took Barry the lamb into her home in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, last month \nMrs Childs took Barry the lamb into her home in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, last month so she could bottle-feed him round the clock after his mum rejected him as a newborn. \nBarry, now four weeks old, is a rare Valais Blacknose, a breed that was only introduced to the UK from Switzerland in 2014. \nThe youngster loves nothing more than curling up in a dog basket by the Aga to keep warm and has clearly learnt to copy Mrs Childs' six dogs - jumping up on the sofa for a cuddle.

BPNS Barry is a rare Valais Blacknose \nHe comes when she calls his name and still heads into the house for his six bottles a day. He would quite happily snuggle up by the Aga all day Emma Childs \nBut he has been accepted by the other lambs and Mrs Childs has already found a home for him to go to once he is fully weaned in about seven weeks' time. \nMrs Childs, 52, said: “Barry is an incredible character. He's just like a dog. \n“From day one he's been around the dogs so he's completely at home with them. He would quite happily snuggle up by the Aga all day Emma Childs \n“He's very loving and he will jump up on the sofa and sit on my lap. \n“He knows his name, follows me everywhere like a dog and comes when I call him. \n“He is lovely natured and exceedingly tame. \n“He was rejected by his mum, which is quite unusual for the breed. She has had lambs before, there's no rhyme or reason to it. BNPS Emma Childs (right) and business partner Abby Bolt relax with Barry and the dogs on the sofa \n“I tried to get her to accept him but she wasn't having it so I had no option but to step in. \n“He's been an inside lamb ever since. He's very special. \n“My husband Scott has been brilliant about it. All our dogs are rescue dogs so he knows what I'm like and he didn't bat an eyelid when I brought Barry in. \n“When he was first born I was bottle feeding him round the clock every three hours, through the night as well. He was quite small and weak. \n“At night he would go in a dog cage in front of the Aga and during the day he would either sit in a dog bed or follow me round.
