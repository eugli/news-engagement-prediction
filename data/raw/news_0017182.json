It claims to have multiple cells in Turkey. \nTurkey is a member of the NATO alliance and the U.S-led coalition against IS. It shares borders with Syria and Iraq, two war-torn nations at the heart of the fight against IS militants. \nTurkish forces have been deployed in Syria since August with the aim of clearing a border patch of IS militants and Syrian Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers related to its own Kurdish insurgency. \nSome of those taken into custody Sunday reportedly were active in conflict zones and engaged in recruitment efforts for IS, relaying its propaganda over social media. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:11:06.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
