After the recent humiliating 333-run loss against Australia in the Pune Test, Indian team receives another setback, as Star India, which is the current jersey sponsor of the senior men’s and women’s cricket teams, as well as the U-19 one, has decided against bidding for the apparel sponsorship again. \nWhile citing ‘lack of clarity’ on the game’s future, Star India CEO Uday Shankar was quoted as saying by various websites, including The Times of India: “We have been very proud that our name is carried on the jersey of team India. But given all the uncertainties, we have decided not to bid for it again. The commitments being asked for are too onerous without any clarity”. \nThe current sponsorship deal between the BCCI and Star India is expiring by March this year, following which another round of bidding will be called upon, on a tender basis. The new sponsor will have its logo displayed in the senior men’s and women’s cricket teams, as well as the U-19 and A teams. \nThe Star India CEO also added the lack of clarity between the ICC and BCCI over certain matters, behind the decision. \nStar India took over the role of the principal team sponsor from Sahara India group in December 2013. Their logo was first displayed on the Indian jersey during the tour of New Zealand in January 2014. Also during the fifth ODI between India and New Zealand at Vizag last year, Star came up with a unique initiative of displaying the cricketers' mothers’ names behind the jersey. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:39:19.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
