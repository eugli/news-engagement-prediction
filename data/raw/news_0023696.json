(Alec Tabak/for New York Daily News) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  48 PM \nThe probe into the grisly killing inside a luxury Sutton Place apartment is shaping up to be a scandal in itself. \nLawrence Dilione, a suspect in the murder of 26-year-old Hofstra grad Joseph Comunale, had two lawyers the night of his arrest — but detectives ignored the law and pushed him to talk over a 40-hour period as he was confined to a tiny room, Dilione’s lawyer argued in an unsealed court filing. \nIt’s the basis for a dirty confession claim that could harm the district attorney's chances of making a murder case against either of their two main suspects. \nNo one has been charged with the murder to date and Dilione, 28, along with friends James Rackover, 25, and Max Gemma, 29, have only been charged with hindering prosecution and tampering with physical evidence. \nDilione and Rackover also face charges of concealing a human corpse for the alleged disposal of Comunale’s mangled and burned body in a shallow grave in New Jersey. \nSince the arrests, problems for the prosecution have piled up. \nAlso revealed in the newly public documents is the claim that police did not have Rackover’s permission to search his apartment on Nov. 14, a day after a booze and drug-fueled party turned ugly. \nRackover was not home when police went to his E. 59th St. apartment to search and the permission to enter was from his housekeeper, who spoke limited English and not the suspect himself, according to documents. Lawrence Dilione is walked into Manhattan Central Booking on Nov. 17, when cops apparently pushed him to talk despite knowing he had lawyers. (Alec Tabak/for New York Daily News) \nInvestigators allegedly let themselves in and encountered Rackover's cleaning woman. They asked her in Spanish “whether they could look in one remaining room of the apartment - the defendant's bedroom - to determine whether a missing person was located there,” according to a motion filed by Rackover’s lawyer Maurice Sercarz. \n\"When she did not object, the police searched the bedroom,\" the filing says. “The police did not have the defendant's permission or authority to engage in this search.\" \nThe document was heavily redacted after Justice Charles Solomon signed off on a bid by the Manhattan DA’s office to limit the exposure of details they claimed could harm their investigation. \nThe move was highly unusual in light of the fact that the DA — at first — was making request to limit what is public in filings that aren’t their own. \nCops may have coerced suspects to cooperate in NYC party stabbing \nThe sealed information would “seriously compromise” the murder investigation, according to Solomon’s order, although it's not clear what information had been redacted. \nThe filings — partially unsealed on Friday after a effort to intervene was made by the Daily News — illustrate in detail the extent to which Dilione's rights were allegedly ignored in the rush to locate Comunale. The statement that led to Comunale's body in Oceanport, N.J., could be suppressed as well as possibly evidence of the corpse itself since it may have been obtained only through an inadmissable confession. \nThe suspect was represented by attorneys Joseph Evans and by Gordon Gemma, the father of his childhood pal and co-defendant, both of whom told him to tell detectives he was represented by counsel. Dilione (l.) is charged alongside James Rackover in Joseph Communale's death. (Instagram/Instagram) \n“It is respectfully submitted that the rule of law cannot be trumped because the police were under enormous pressure to locate the body of a missing person believed to have been murdered,” Dilione's attorney Michael Pappa wrote in his papers. \nPolice blunder may ruin key evidence in NYC party slay \n“Thus, any evidence gained from the illegally obtained statements would constitute the fruits of the poisonous tree.” \nAuthorities say Comunale was murdered in Rackover’s apartment Nov. 13. An effort to conceal the crime scene was underway although prosecutors say Gemma is not suspected in the killing. \nRackover is the \"surrogate son\" of high-profile jeweler Jeffrey Rackover, who lives in the same swanky building. \nDilione allegedly beat Comunale unconscious after a fight about cigarettes, but that Rackover decided they needed to finish the job, according to Dilione’s version of events. \nRackover repeatedly stabbed Comunale and tried dismember him in the bathtub, Dilione said. Rackover was seen later loading a duffel bag into his Mercedes and leaving the city with Dilione. \nDilione's damning words may never make it to a jury. Max Gemma (from l.), Dilione, and Rackover in State Supreme Court on Monday. (Alec Tabak/for New York Daily News) \nSometime after 10 p.m. Gordon Gemma “identified himself as an attorney to detectives” and “advised detectives that he represented Larry Dilione and that he was not to be questioned,” court papers say. \nAt 10:45 p.m., Dilione was in the presence of detectives in transit to the stationhouse when in an “open and obvious” fashion he had a conversation with Evans and \"notified the detectives that he was on the phone with his lawyer and asked which precinct he was being taken to.\" \nEvans \"clearly heard\" one of the detectives tell his client where they were going, the papers say. \nAs Dilione was spilling the beans at the 13th Precinct stationhouse on E. 21st St., cops were \"deliberately stalling\" Evans who was at the station and trying to see his client. \nPappa called it “simply inconceivable” that cops at the stationhouse didn’t know Dilione’s whereabouts under their own roof. \n“Getting in a cab. You can say that you are represented by counsel. And that he has advised you to not make any statements at this time,\" Evans texted to his client at 11:05 p.m. as both were on their way to the stationhouse. \nThey ignored his right to counsel and pressured Dilione into telling them where to find Comunale, the lawyer said. \n“They became angry with him and when he said he wanted his lawyer to be there with him before he answered any of their questions they repeated efforts to get him to say where the body was,\" Pappa wrote. \nDilione was not read his Miranda rights until the afternoon on Nov. 17, even though he got into a car with cops late on Nov. 15. He made additional statements after they were read, his lawyer says.
