(Craig Clary/BSMG) \nMcDonogh’s Quinn Devaney, a Catonsville resident, made his final homecoming a success as he captured a third straight MIAA championship. \nDevaney, who will wrestle at the University of Maryland next year, won a 12-1 major decision over Dylan Blau, of St. Paul’s. \n“I was just basically trying to dominate kids,” said Devaney, who had pins in his first three matches. “I’m just to get to my stuff, my offense. I’m not trying to think about what they want to do, I trying to think about what am I going to do and be able to execute that.” \nHis last visit down Frederick Rd. was a victory, but his season is not over as he prepares for the upcoming Maryland State Independent School and National Prep tournaments. \n“It’s always great to come to MSJ and do what I’ve been doing,” Devaney said. “I want to win both of those. I think I’m definitely capable of doing both. I think it’s a matter of me doing what I need to do in order to be a state champ and a National Prep champ.” \nJoining him at the top of the podium from McDonogh were teammates Ray Kable (126) and P.J. Mustipher (285). \nKurt McHenry (106) was the first of six champions for St. Paul’s. \nHe defeated Barnabae, 12-5, to stay undefeated (50-0). \n“I forced him to shoot and every time I forced him to shoot I scored and every time I attacked I scored,” McHenry said. “I had to limit my offense a little bit because I tore my meniscus so it was a little tougher on me.” \nSt. Paul’s coach Rob Eiter has been impressed with the sophomore 106-pounder.

I tried to calm him down a little bit.” \nImran Heard (138), Dale Tiongson (170), Jack Parr (182), Noah Kalishman (195) and John Urban (220) also won titles for the Crusaders. \nUrban defeated St. Joe’s Keagan Rill, 3-1 in overtime, for the second year in a row. \nThe Crusaders were without three-time MIAA tournament champion Daniel Planta, who ruptured a bursa sac and had an infection two weeks ago. \nPlanta, who will wrestle at Penn University next year, was first at 126 pounds in the Maryland State Wrestling Association rankings. \n“The way that our guys responded with the loss of Daniel was very special,” Eiter said. \nArchbishop Spalding’s Paul Truntich (120) was the only finalist who won with a pin as he decked McDonogh’s Ryan Leventhal in 1:46. \nA year after having surgery for a torn meniscus and not placing in the MIAA tournament, Loyola Blakefield’s Dominick Reyes won the title at 152 pounds with a 7-5 decision over Archbishop Curley’s Josh Laubach. \nReyes, who lost to Raubach in overtime last week, broke a 5-5 tie with a reversal with 24 seconds left in the third period. \n“It feels awesome to get a little revenge and win in the finals,” Reyes said. \nResults \nTeam (top 10) \nMSJ 286, McD 273, SP 243.5, AS 162, Loy 129, Gil 109, AC 90.5, JC 79, Sev 59, SM 47. \nIndividual finals \n106-McHenry (SP) dec.
