Of course, when that happens, a poll must follow, thus the existence of this follow-up post. \nSo let’s decide once and for all! Do you prefer the back button to be on the left, where Google, creator of the platform that all Android phones are built upon, has placed it and where almost everyone other Android OEM places it, or should the back button go on the right, where Samsung, king of smartphone makers who (rightfully) laughs at all who question its decisions, puts it? \nLeft or right. You must choose. A Phone's Back Button Belongs on the Left or Right? Left Loading ... Post navigation Previous Story Deal: Good Time to Buy a MicroSD Card, SanDisk 64GB for $16 and Samsung 128GB for $48 Bourne, Jason C. \nI think it should be baked into Android that if you have on-screen buttons then you should be able to customize (out of a couple of options) the other two buttons (the middle one will always be Home). jrbmed08 \nLeft master race! That said, it makes sense to allow the user to customize the order if they’re on screen. imHOWIE \nI use the back button a heck of a lot more than the recenct apps button. When I hold the phone in my right hand,it’s easier to reach the back button when it’s on the right. Xious \nYou should be able to configure them the way you want. HOWEVER, the back arrow points to the left. iOS has their back button of the left. Shouldn’t it seem that the standard is on the left? sbgrizdan \nHere is a workaround, non-root fix for all those who wish the buttons were switched on any Galaxy phone: \n1) Download the “Buttons Remapper” app ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.irishin.buttonsremapper ) 2) Edit the Back and Recent Apps actions in the app to be the action of the other. The functionality of these buttons will now be switched. However, the permanent button icons will now need to be fixed to avoid the icon confusion. The only way to fix this is to turn off the button lights so you don’t see the buttons at all. See the next step. 3) Download the “Galaxy Button Lights 2” app ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notquiteinsane.galaxybuttonlights2 ) 4) Turn off the lights of your Galaxy phone. This takes away the confusion of the icons. \nYour phone buttons are now switched! I actually like having the buttons lights turned off and hidden, as it makes the phone more sleek. SVTCobra \nThe arrow points left, it should be on the left. It’s been on the left for years, decades, in web browsers. Me \n5.2 or smaller = Left 5.5 or bigger = Right \nBut honestly I don’t care. More concerned about the aesthetics. Like Sony’s weird ass home button. Leif Sikorski \nThe button layout is actually a reason why I prefer Samsung phones. It would be a bad decision to make it like everybody else. Beside that it also just makes sense. Most people rarely use the recent apps button but the back button gets used quite a lot in Android. So where should it be? At the position that’s the easiest and most comfortable to reach for the majority of people (right handed users) – that’s the right side. Especially on larger phones the left side is much more comfortable to touch than the right. I’m quite sure they’ve their statistics on how often people use which button and when I look at SmartLabs where they listen for customer feedback there are quite a lot of people (including me) who prefer their layout. jim \nok, this is , without a doubt the stupidest poll ive ever seen on here, is it really that slow of a news day? discopunkk \nhttps://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e3ef64f5d8b3e1b0dd5fb8511428c3d9a7d2abb002da8fb8880316a2217fa18b.png Alan Burnstine \nI liked that I could configure it on my HTC One M8. Really the best option since there are differing opinions, and people with multiple devices may want them all the same just to avoid confusion. J. Gilbertson \nI usually hold my pixel right handed and it’s better in my opinion to extend my thumb for the back button than to accidentally bump it with the palm below my thumb. The solution is simple: Stop the phablet phones! Pixel is a great one handed phone! Bonedatt \nIt doesn’t really matter to me. I adjust quickly to the placements, on whatever device I consider as my daily driver. Right now it’s a Samsung device, so it’s on the right. When it was an hTc or the Motorola Nexus 6, it was on the “normal” place which was on the left. mcdonsco \nHey Kellen, I knew you were going to poll this! That thread got heated quick! \nJust remember, regardless of the results, there is no right or wrong here only opinion/preference. Matthew Brown \nI keep mine on the right, simply because 90% of the time I’m holding the phone in my left hand and it’s easier to reach the far (right) side than the near (left) side with my thumb. But I have a V20 which allows me the choice. My previous phone (M9) also had the option, and my wife’s Axon 7 has it too. To me, the option makes the most sense. RMW \nFor a couple of years I had a Samsung Tablet and an LG phone. I was always hitting the wrong button to go back. Even though I’m all Samsung now, I still think having the back button on the right is bass-ackwards. tallerrr \nHow come? Samsung has been the most consistent in terms of button layouts out of all Android manufacturer. They had the same button layout since Galaxy S1. \nI’ve never thought of back button on the right side as backwards since Samsung is who made Android popular. ShadyBrady \nI’m right handed with short fat thumbs. That used to be the only (main) reason why I would root my phone’s. For a ROM where you can manipulate the navigation buttons. I would always swap back and recent buttons. Is it really that hard for stock Android to implement this? The only thing I don’t like is the look of the back button on the right side. Doesn’t look right, but so much easier to use. Using Pie Control now to get by. Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ \nI use my phones left-handed (despite being a righty) which makes Samsung phones a pain in the ass to use. I hit back a lot more often than the multitasking button. Allyn K C \nSame here – I hold my phone in the left hand which frees my dominant hand to use a keyboard, pen/pencil, stylus, dinner fork, etc. \nI’ve been wanting a survey for quite a while with the options: * I’m right-handed and usually hold phone in right; * I’m right handed and usually hold phone in left; * I’m left handed and usually hold phone in right; * I’m left handed and usually hold phone in left; * I’m a magical ambidextrous unicorn that uses whichever hand grabs the phone first. Cakefish \nThe last one for me, but I’m right-handed. OligarchyAmbulance \nI’ve never understood why right-handers hold their phone in their right hand. I hold mine in my left for the same reason as you. I want my dominant hand to actually be usable while holding a phone, rather than fumbling around. Bradford Davis \nI want to say ‘Left’ but I’ve had a Samsung to long that I think I have re-wired my brain Bonedatt \nYep! Chris Hannan \nBack button on the right is a little more convenient, but it just looks wrong. Not really an issue on my Galaxy S7 Edge because I turned the lights off and can’t see the buttons, but on the screen I want it on the left. cbn4forums \nReally doesn’t matter as long as the user knows where it is and gets used to it.
