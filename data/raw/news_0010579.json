Too heavy.. The heaviest caskets are those carrying children. Our hearts are heavy as we come to terms with the rude reality that, yes, you have transited to be with The Jesus you so glowing just spoke about, loved and served well. \nJephthah Aireankhue Ohiomokhare, son to my two friends and colleagues, Senami and Imevhbore Emmanuel Ohiomokhare, son to all of us who knew him, was a phenomenonal kid. \nStrong and fervent in spirit and strong in character. A Bible school teacher, an A student and a pride to us all. \nAlways stifling a smile each time I pinched his biceps. \nOur last dance together, Jeff – Jeff was at grandpa’s burial and I apologised that I had not fulfilled my promise of getting you a T shirt, the only souvenir you wanted when next I travel. It is painful, Jeff, that after everything, you still left. \nBut we are consoled by this fact… You slept in the Lord and He took you to Himself, innocent, guiless, holy and pure…. Now, you behold Him face to face… Hallelujah. \nRest, my boy! \nRest, our adorable dude and 7-star General… And you were only fifteen!!!! We will miss you, Jeff – Jeff. \nSincere condolences to my aburo, Senami Aminah Ohiomokhare and Emmanuel Ohiomokhare… You guys will be fine… You will be very fine. \nGod who allowed this to happen yesterday, will ensure you are fine everyday as He holds your hand and wall you through this senseless, confusing maze..
