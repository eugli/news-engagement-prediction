She had no interest in toys, and her mother, Kara Cunningham, said the toddler had just uttered her first word, \"Mama.\" \nLilah has autism, a developmental disorder that includes impaired social interaction, limited communication skills and behavior that interferes with learning and other activity. \nThe fact that she now is able to say that she wants juice or a favorite book and that she can play with toys and other children is the hard-won result of intensive therapy, known as Applied Behavior Analysis, or ABA, that began at the Metairie center when she was 2½. \nLilah works one-on-one with a trained therapist 27 hours a week, a level of intervention that autism service providers say is critical. \nBut it's also expensive, $40,000 to $60,000 a year, and Kelly Spears, owner of the center, and others who provide ABA therapy are worried that gains in making treatment more widely available are threatened by recent changes in insurance reimbursements. \nLate last year, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana informed providers that, as of Jan. 1, it was cutting reimbursements for the therapy by 18 percent, said Melissa Juneau, executive director of the Emerge Center in Baton Rouge. \nMedicaid followed with a notice of an even deeper cut, 25 percent across the state, according to Juneau. \nJuneau and other providers have responded by forming the Louisiana Coalition for Access to Autism Services to increase awareness of the need for their work and the importance of putting it within the reach of as many families as possible. \nFor providers, less money means having to reduce services, the coalition says, and many have had to stop taking new clients. For families, that will mean less access to therapy in a state that already has a severe shortage of such services. \nJuneau said that meetings with Blue Cross were productive, and the insurer has softened the blow. Cuts to reimbursements now range from 8 percent to 18 percent, depending on who is providing the therapy. \nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana said in a prepared statement that it has been collaborating with major providers across the state to build a network of professionals who offer services like ABA. \nWhen it first began covering ABA services, there was little guidance for insurers, Blue Cross said. \"Before January of this year, we did not require ABA providers to be in a Blue Cross provider network. The rates we paid were based on out-of-date, generalized billing codes because nothing better existed,\" it said. \nBut the American Medical Association now has billing codes more specific to ABA services, and the Legislature has created the Louisiana Behavior Analyst Board. \nBlue Cross says its statewide network of ABA providers allows access to the therapy in every part of the state and protects members against additional costs outside of their health plan coverage. Network providers have agreed to the reimbursement rates and some might actually see an increase, the company said. \n\"We anticipated these changes might be unpopular with some providers and even some customers, but we concluded that implementing these changes was the right thing to do to give children affected by autism access to the most qualified providers and specialized care and to help our customers and their families protect themselves from unexpected expenses,\" the statement concluded. \nThe cuts put in place by Medicaid are of greater concern to providers, Juneau said. Medicaid is the largest insurer of children in Louisiana. Half of the 109 children with autism who receive therapy at the Emerge Center in Baton Rouge are covered by Medicaid. \nSo are most of the children at the Spears Center, Kelly Spears said. That includes Lilah, and like most providers, the Spears Center has a long waiting list — 40 children. \nJeff Reynolds, undersecretary of the state Department of Health, said that Medicaid has been covering ABA at market rate, something it does not do with any other service. He called it an outlier, noting that hospitals and doctors are reimbursed far below market rate by Medicaid. \nWhen Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana lowered its reimbursement rate in January, it had an effect on Medicaid. The program will not pay more for a service than the private sector does, Reynolds said. \nABA is an important service, Reynolds said, but paying for it means that money has to be taken from somewhere else. Since Medicaid began covering ABA in 2014, the costs have doubled each year, he said. \nThe Department of Health is projecting that Medicaid will pay nearly $28 million for ABA in 2017. \nProviders, however, argue that ABA is cost-effective. The lifetime cost of supporting someone with autism is $3.2 million, mainly borne by taxpayers, the coalition said. If someone with autism can be mainstreamed and employed, that cost will be far less. \nThe coalition also says that the state is exaggerating the growth rate of ABA costs. Lloyd Boudloche Jr., CEO of Behavioral Developmental Services in Monroe, said the Department of Health isn't taking into account the fact that services in Louisiana are in a ramp-up phase. Moreover, he said, there simply aren't enough professionals to provide the services at the growth rate anticipated by the state. \n\"There are still not enough providers to meet the need,\" Juneau said. \"Many, many, many children are waiting. It's discouraging.\" Every month that goes by is time lost, she said. \"The earlier and more intensive (the service), the better the outcome,\" she said. \nShe and others fear that the lowered rate of reimbursement will mean a smaller pool of providers and less access to services, reversing a more positive trend that began when Louisiana began requiring private insurance companies to cover the service. \nBefore that, she said, only wealthy families could afford ABA. But in 2008, the Legislature passed House Bill 958, which requires coverage of autism diagnosis and treatment, including ABA, by private carriers. In 2012, House Bill 771 expanded coverage through age 21 and remove the lifetime cap. \nMedicaid did not begin covering ABA until 2014, and that was the result of a federal court ruling in the case of Chisholm vs. Kliebert. \nAccess began to expand after that ruling, Juneau said, calling it a shining moment for Louisiana and a great day for children with autism. \nThe nonprofit Emerge Center, originally the Baton Rouge Speech and Hearing Foundation, began offering ABA in 2004. \"We've seen the value of what is done. We've seen the growth in these children, from nonverbal with no interaction to a child who can go to kindergarten with some support,\" Juneau said. \nLilah's mother can attest to that. The goal is for her to attend kindergarten next year, and Spears said she's expected to meet that goal. \nFor Lilah's family, the diagnosis of autism was devastating. The little girl had stopped responding to sounds at about 8 months and stopped making eye contact, Cunningham said, although she was a happy baby. Cunningham thought there was a hearing issue. \n\"When your child is diagnosed with autism, you're pretty much by yourself,\" Cunningham said. She went to every center that offered ABA, putting her toddler on waiting list after waiting list. Finally, there was an opening, and Lilah began going to the Spears Learning Center. \n\"When a family gets a spot, it feels like a miracle,\" Juneau said. \nFollow Sara Pagones on Twitter, @spagonesadvocat.
