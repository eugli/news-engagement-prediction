Article continues below \nRooney left the Toffees for United in a deal worth £27million back in 2004, and since then he's gone on to become the Red Devils' all time highest goalscorer. \nAnd though the offer was rejected at the time, the report also states that Everton boss Ronald Koeman may opt to try and prize him away again over the summer. Article continues below Jamie Carragher sums up Ranieri's sacking with scathing two-word tweet to Leicester \nThe 31-year-old has been in and out of the side this season as he has struggled with injury and a loss of form, but with question marks still hanging over the future of Romelu Lukaku, Koeman will be in the hunt for a new spearhead for his attack. \nKoeman was recently asked if he felt Rooney was still a major force in the English top flight, saying: “Yeah I think Wayne Rooney is still on that high level to compete in a competition like the Premier League. \n“Everybody knows if you make a choice like China it is not about football on a high level anymore - the first reason is about money. You are not really involved in European football. \n“China is a totally different level of football, so then you say goodbye to the highest competition.” \nRooney hit 17 goals in 77 appearances for Everton during his two seasons there, and if given the chance to return, it would surely represent a better option than a risky move to China. \nHowever, the player's agent, Paul Stretford, travelled to the far east twice this week for talks, and there is still an opportunity for him to pocket some £600,000-per-week, so Everton's gambit had better be a good one. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
