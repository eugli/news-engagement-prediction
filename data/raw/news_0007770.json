There is no doubt that Alia Bhatt and Sidharth Malhotra, who started their journey as actors together with 'Student of The Year', have continued to remain one of the most loved couples of Bollywood, but their fans might not be happy to know that their cute love story has come to an end. As per reports, Alia and Sidharth has called it quits, albeit temporarily, as both the actors want to seriously focus on their respective careers and don't want their professional lives to suffer in the bargain. Reportedly, Sid and Alia had started maintaining distance during the Dream Team tour which they were part of and would only engage in formal talks. Sid, after going through a box office dud in 'Baar Baar Dekho', now wants to invest all his energies in taking right career decisions and doesn't want his personal life and his affair with Alia to keep him in the news and headlines. Alia too has two important films to divert her energies to – 'Dear Zindagi' and 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania' – and has decided to dedicate herself completely to her work for now. Although the two ex-lovebirds remain cordial, reports suggest they are not a couple anymore.
