The 36-year-old actress says her husband Saif is a hands-on father and both she and the actor are growing as parents with every passing day.\nWhile most women shy away from cameras during pregnancy, Kareena was one star who posed for shutterbugs all throughout the nine months and impressed with her stylish maternity wardrobe. She even stepped out for a dinner date with her husband just a week after giving birth and recently walked the ramp at the Lakme Fashion Week. The actress says it was nothing unusual for her as she does not believe that pregnant women or new mothers should stay indoors.\nOn the work front, the actress will resume the shooting of 'Veere Di Wedding' in the next few months and has already started working on her fitness. The film which also stars Sonam Kapoor and Swara Bhaskar will be directed by Shashanka Ghosh.\nKareena says post-motherhood, there will be no change in the kind of films she does and will always prefer to have a mixed bag of projects.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:49:39.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
