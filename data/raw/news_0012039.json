Theresa May sat next to Boris Johnson when the vote result was announced \nTop-flight Tories seen arriving at the party on the bus included Michael Gove, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, Justice Secretary Liz Truss and Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke. \nAlso spotted on board were Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, party chairman Patrick McLoughlin and Culture Secretary Karen Bradley. \nIt was unclear if the same Tory MPs were on the bus when it returned to Parliament. \nTheresa May had pushed the votes back by more than an hour, giving her MPs more time to party. Another vote was due at midnight. \nShe returned to the Commons chamber dressed all in black, with a black tuxedo-style jacket, heavy chain link-style necklace and glittering bracelet. \nShe chatted and laughed with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Disabilities Minister Penny Mordaunt while the votes were counted.

Last year four Tory election posters were auctioned off for £50,000 \nIn previous years items on the block have included a shoe shopping trip with Theresa May herself, along with lush holidays and rounds of grouse shooting at swanky hotels. \nLast year four Tory campaign posters were flogged for £50,000, a day of campaigning with Zac Goldsmith went for £35,000 and the raffle was drawn by Samantha Cameron.
