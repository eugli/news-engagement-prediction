The study found a statistically significant association between stroke risk and early menarche (Shutterstock) \nTo study the relationship between stroke and menstruation researchers followed a group of 1,412 postmenopausal women in the rural town of Ohasama, Japan, between 1998 and 2010. \nThrough initial questionnaires and follow-up surveys, they tracked the women’s ages of menarche and menopause, if and when they had a stroke and other factors such as height, weight, heart disease and hypertension. \nAfter taking confounding factors into account, researchers still found a statistically significant association between stroke risk and early menarche. \nThis finding supports another study that found the same trend among middle-aged women in the UK. Studies by other groups found no strong association, but the researchers point out that most of those studies focused on the relationship between menarche and stroke mortality, not just stroke risk. \n“Early menarche might predict the incidence of stroke rather than the mortality caused by stroke,” said Takayoshi Ohkubo, professor at Tohoku University.
