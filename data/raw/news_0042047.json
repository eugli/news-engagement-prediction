(ABC News: Mark Bennett) \nTo get to Albany motorists now have to take an 80 kilometre diversion on dirt roads. \nIt will be weeks before Main Roads will be able to complete a temporary causeway to take east west traffic across the Philips River while a replacement bridge is built. \nThe damage bill was estimated to be around $20 million, but that has been constantly revised as the full cost of repairing the 840km of damaged roads in the south east region comes to light. Tourist trade and supply route cut to town \nRavensthorpe has been deserted by the tourists, with the town's caravan park completely empty. \nBusinesses supplied by trucks are desperate for normal delivery services to resume. \nAt the hardware store jerry cans to store fuel have flown of the shelf, along with tarpaulins and roof fixing screws to repair the damage from the rain. \nNormally the caravaners and passing traffic are the lifeblood of the town. \nLily Prosser says the floods have been a disaster for her fledging cafe business which she opened just six weeks ago.

(ABC News: Mark Bennett) \n\"It's been terrible, the whole town has been suffering, we've had no tourists coming in or stopping at all,\" Ms Prosser said. \n\"We are in the middle of nowhere and there's not a lot of business here as it is, so when the traffic stops the business stops when there's nothing coming through. \n\"Even though we've got two mine sites here they really don't come into town at all and we need to rely on the tourists so everyone is struggling.\" Maintenance teams must mobilise \nThe federal Member for O'Connor, Rick Wilson, inspected the damage yesterday with shire CEO Ian Fitzgerald. \n\"The really important thing is for the shires to be able to get an exemption under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery funding that was announced by the state and federal governments on Wednesday,\" Mr Fitzgerald said. \n\"Currently local governments are not allowed to use their maintenance crews under the relief package but here there is so much damage to local roads that they need urgent attention. \n\"The federal minister has offered an exemption to the West Australian Government and we are hoping very much that the WA Government will take that up. \n\"We spoke to farmers who have livestock on other blocks who can't check them to see if fences are still intact and whether their animals are still there and need feeding.\" \nHe said it was important for the council to be allowed to get the local networks open for the farmers. \n\"What we've seen here today is extraordinary and the local farmers are going to need a lot of help to get back on their feet,\" Mr Fitzgerald said.
