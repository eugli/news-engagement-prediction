Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound.\" \nNow Mr Trump has explained, via Twitter, that his remark was in reference to a Fox News news package about immigrants and Sweden. Sweden experienced a relatively quiet news day on Friday Credit: PA \nTaking to social media, his preferred form of communication, the President said: \"My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.\" \nMeanwhile, a White House spokeswoman said that Mr Trump had been talking about rising crime and recent incidents in general, not referring to a specific issue. \nThe President's original comments caused a stir across Sweden and social media in general, prompting hundreds of tweets and a local paper to publish a list of events which happened on Friday that appeared to have no connection to terrorist activity.
