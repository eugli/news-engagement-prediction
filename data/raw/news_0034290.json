And even better — they taste delicious. Pepperoni pinwheel recipe 1 box frozen puff pastry 1 cup marinara sauce Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Thaw the puff pastry, then roll it out on a lightly floured surface. Cut one puff pastry sheet into 4 squares with a pizza cutter. Cut 2-inch lines down each side toward the center of the square. Place a tablespoon of ricotta in the center of the dough and spread it out. Place 1 tablespoon of marinara on the ricotta and spread it around. Place 5 pepperonis on the marinara and fold each corner to the center creating a smaller square. Take the same corner of each piece and fold it to the center creating your pinwheel. Place it on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Mix your egg and water to create an egg wash. Using a pastry brush, brush your pinwheels with the egg wash. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until golden-brown. \nThis post was sponsored by HORMEL® Pepperoni.
