What he helped engineer on Sunday was nothing short of astounding, and with heroics from just about everyone up and down the roster, it's hard to single out anyone but the superstar for the most valuable player. \nBut White caught an astounding 14 receptions, smashing a Super Bowl record. And he matched Terrell Davis's Super Bowl XXXII with three touchdowns (which earned Davis the MVP), the last of which was a Herculean effort to find the end zone for the game-winning score.
