And this afternoon, he celebrated the life of one soldier, Sgt. Buddy Hughie, with a moving tribute: Sunday will mark a decade since the death of someone most of you have never heard of, SGT Buddy Hughie, age 25. pic.twitter.com/s25NomwS1l \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 2/ Buddy had helped saved lives in NOLA post-Katrina as an Oklahoma National Guardsman. In Afghanistan he served in Nuristan Province \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 3/ On Feb 19, 2007, Buddy was part of a team of US and Afghan troops at COP Keating searching for a kidnapped local teenager. \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 4/Buddy had recently described to his grandmother how well he worked with the Afghan troops. They were a great team, he told her. \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 5/ The boy was found, but Buddy and his team of ANA troops were caught in an enemy ambush from a ridge. The insurgents had a new marksman. \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 6/ The enemy marksman shot Adel, an Afghan National Army soldier. Buddy was a medic. He ran to Adel to administer First Aid. A shot rang out \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 7/ LT Vic Johnson ran to Buddy. An RPG went off in front of him; shrapnel hit Johnson's helmet, but he kept moving to Buddy. \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 8/ By the time he reached Buddy, the young man was gone. Johnson couldn't find the wound, it was hidden under Buddy's body armor somewhere. \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 9/ Johnson then saw Adel, who'd been hit in the chest. Johnson tried to radio for a medic. No one responded. He ran back to the trucks. \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 10/ Johnson and SPC Gil Montanez ran back through the bullet storm to Buddy and Adel. Montanez found Buddy's wound. \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 11/ Montanez realized that when he'd reached for his medic bag to save Adel, Buddy had exposed himself. The bullet found a path to his heart \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 12/ \"KIA,\" Johnson called into the radio, followed by Buddy's ID code: HOTEL for Hughie and the last 4 digits of his Social Security number \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 13/ This was Buddy's second tour in Afghanistan. He'd served there 2002-2003 as well. He had a new wife and a brand new baby boy, Cooper. \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 14/ US airpower chased off the insurgents and Johnson and his team retrieved Adel, who flashed him a thumbs up in the back of the pickup. \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 15/ But half an hour later, when Johnson's convoy arrived back at COP Keating, it was greeted by two body bags. Adel hadn't survived either. \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 16/ At 9:40 pm in South Carolina, two soldiers in their dress uniforms arrived at the house where Buddy's wife and baby lived with her folks \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 17/ Her dad wrote about that night two weeks afterward. You can read it here: https://t.co/uTWFlJJ9VF \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 18/ Here's a post he wrote on the 5th anniversary of Buddy's death. https://t.co/CClfCkOWGq \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 19/ Those who served with SGT Buddy \"Doc\" Hughie still miss him deeply; he was, they say, a truly great and giving man. pic.twitter.com/gj10v9ot6R \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 20/ @soonergrunt wrote about him in May 2007 — https://t.co/vZwYSd38va \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 21/ There was a Forward Operating Base named after Buddy, FOB Hughie, but it was handed over to the Afghan National Army in 2012. \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 22/ Cooper turned 10 in November. He made the honor roll and loves to read. pic.twitter.com/vZABYXm6Od \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 23/ So this Sunday, if you would, please have a thought for SGT Buddy Hughie, for Cooper, and for everyone who misses him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:06:11.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
