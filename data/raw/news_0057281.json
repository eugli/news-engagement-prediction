I have no wish to take this thing forward,\" he said. \n\nAkhilesh, earlier on Monday last had made an apparent attack on Modi by making \"donkey\" remark while referring to an advertisement of Gujarat government in which megastar Amitabh Bachchan promotes tourism in the state. \n\nWithout taking any name, he had \"advised\" the \"biggest Bollywood actor of the century\" not to \"campaign for the donkeys of Gujarat\". \n\nAkhilesh's attack had followed Modi's accusation against him of indulging in discrimination in power supply on the basis of religion. \n\nReacting to the 'donkey' comment, Rupani had said yesterday that Akhilesh had insulted Gujarat. \n\n\"I think Akhilesh Yadav is frustrated as he can see that his party is losing the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election,\" Rupani had said. \n\nAddressing the election meeting today, Akhilesh again targeted Modi. \n\n\"He (Modi) knows he has lost the battle and is out to change his course,\" Akhilesh said in reference to Prime Minister's 'Diwali-Ramzan, graveyard-cremation ground\" comments. \n\n\"If we give 24-hour power on Diwali and also on Ramzan and Christmas , will it not benefit everyone?...I don't know what all the Prime Minister is seeing...since last Diwali we had decided that 22-24 hour power will be given to cities,\" he said. \n\n\"These BJP people can say anything to mislead people... you people need not believe in what BJP and BSP leaders say,\" Akhilesh told the gathering. \n\n\"If you want me to be the Chief Minister once again, every single vote should be polled in favour of the SP,\" he added.
