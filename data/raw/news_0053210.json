The front of Sylvia's house boldly displays the slogan on a pink wall, with potted plants and bright flowers on the wall ledge. The facade says a lot about what guests will find upon entering. Like her bright and hip Ocean Park neighborhood, Sylvia's home is filled with an array of colorful furniture, lively plants, and unique art. These are the things Sylvia wants in her home: Elements that she is connected to and tell a story. \"Everything that has a story attracts me and inspires me.\" \nIf Sylvia is attracted to and inspired by an object, she will likely bring it into her home. \"I love looking around and seeing objects or pieces of furniture that bring me back to a different time in my life,\" she says. \"I also have a lot of pieces from my family, pieces that no one of my generation wanted. They remind me of that person that is no longer with us: my grandmother, aunt, great aunt, and so on.\" \nThough Puerto Rico isn't short of beautiful things, Sylvia says it isn't as easy to come across well-designed furniture as in the mainland United States. However, coming from a movie set and interior decorator background, she has a ton of sources where she can find inspiring art and pieces that complement her home. She lives by the expression \"More is more,\" and her home showcases it perfectly. \n→ Want to see more of Sylvia's style? Check out The Dreamcatcher Guesthouse . Apartment Therapy Survey: \nMy Style: Eclectic, vintage, mid-century, antique \nInspiration: Everything that has a story attracts me and inspires me. I also have accumulated a great deal of pieces from my friends. Everything has a story and I feel connected to everything in my house. \nFavorite Element: Lamps and wall art. I studied photography and lighting and its quality fascinated me — how light could transform, accent or dim shapes, corners, textures. Also, the playfulness and mysteriousness of patterns that they create on the walls and ceilings, and how these patterns could also rest in the most intricate ways. They help create very dynamic spaces. The options are endless. \nBiggest Challenge: Convincing people that more is more. \nWhat Friends Say: \"I don't know how you manage to harmonize all of these items in one place.\" \nBiggest Embarrassment: I don't think there is anything that embarrasses me about the house, but maybe the facade, which is very bulky and doesn't represent the magic inside. But I like it, because then when you come in, it's a big surprise. \nProudest DIY: Lamps \nBiggest Indulgence: Artwork \nBest Advice: Get comfortable with layering. Even if you have an industrial or modern space, there are always some corners that can be a bit more overdone. With layering, you can create a special corner or area, and if you have a very simple modern space, it will create a bit of tension and a nice dialogue with the simplicity of the rest. \nDream Sources: Cosas de Ayer y Hoy in San Juan, garage sales, family and friends' houses, Finders Keepers Explore this style: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:11:54.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
