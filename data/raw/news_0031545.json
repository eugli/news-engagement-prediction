Published on February 15, 2017 TBWA/Chiat/Day L.A. Chief Creative Officer Renato Fernandez Credit: TBWA Most Popular \nTBWA/Chiat/Day Los Angeles has named Renato Fernandez its new chief creative officer. Mr. Fernandez steps up from his former post of executive creative director at the agency's Los Angeles headquarters, filling the post vacated by Brent Anderson, who last fall became CCO of TBWA/Media Arts Lab . \nMr. Fernandez joined the agency as an ACD in 2011 and has overseen TBWA 's Gatorade work both in the States and globally. He first took charge of the U.S. account in 2014 but then in 2015 moved up to assume leadership of all global projects as worldwide creative director. \nMr. Fernanadez's arrival comes at a major turning point for the Omnicom agency. Late last week, the holding company announced it was shifting Nissan, one of the agency's top three clients which it has overseen since 1987, to the East Coast to be closer to the client's headquarters in Nashville. The move will lead to a headcount reduction in L.A. In the meantime, he'll help to steer work for new clients such as Intel, whose B-to-B global account the shop won last fall.
