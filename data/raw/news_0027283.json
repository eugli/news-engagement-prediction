He also missed a syllable in another word and mispronounced the phrase where he promised to lower taxes. He closed by badly mis-pronouncing the word for support, as in, \"I need your support.\"\nHe also used anglicized words for business and taxes, Bouchard said.\n\"Those are brutal. They are very easily translateable and the fact that he doesn't [translate them] just shows that there are no efforts whatsoever.\"\nImproving day-to-day \nA spokesman for O'Leary said the leadership candidate wrote his opening and closing statements with the help of his French tutor, and that the tutor is a Quebec Francophone who exclusively speaks French to O'Leary and his staff.\n\"I don't think it's a very fair criticism,\" Ari Laskin said in an interview with CTVNews.ca.\n\"He's been very active in terms of ensuring his French is improving on a day-to-day basis. By her going and saying his pronunciation was incorrect on this or he used the verb was wrong on this, [well] it's not his first language and it's something that he is learning.\"\n\"I think that's a pretty harsh statement [to call it brutal].\"\nLaskin, who doesn't speak French, says O'Leary fits in his French homework between meetings and always has his notebook with him so he can work on it.\nO'Leary spoke French when he was growing up in Montreal, but his family moved when he was seven years old, Laskin said.\n\"This is the first time I've heard any criticism on his pronunciation or his verbage,\" he said.\nBouchard noted in particular that O'Leary mis-pronounced Canadien in a way that a French teacher would correct right away.\n\"It wouldn't be a mistake that a student of French would make repeatedly. [It's] something that would be corrected as soon as you're told that 'A' in French is Ah,\" she said.\n'You have to be determined' \nThat said, poor pronunciation doesn't mean he isn't trying.\n\"Not everybody can pronounce well and it doesn't mean there are no efforts,\" Bouchard said.\nStill, given O'Leary's past comments about French, she questions whether he is truly studying it every day.\nO'Leary initially maintained he didn't need to speak French because he speaks the language of jobs and money. He eventually relented and started French lessons.\n\"I would be surprised to see that it is really true and it is really the case that he's studying every day,\" Bouchard said.\n\"Maybe he has the will eventually to do more about the language situation, but as a professor of French, I know that you really need perseverance, you have to be determined and you have to work hard to reach a good level of fluency, and the younger you start, the better it is. So there are many, many obstacles.\"\nO'Leary isn't the only Conservative Party leadership candidate who is weak in their second language, but he has emerged as a front-runner so his skills are under increasing scrutiny.\nAll 14 candidates agree the next leader needs to be able to debate Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in both official languages, citing in particular the 100 ridings with sizable French-speaking populations.\nRelated Stories Speak loudly and carry a big stick: how Kevin O'Leary would govern Canada Would-be Conservative leaders set sights on O'Leary in TV star's debate debut Conservatives defend French-language skills at Quebec meeting", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:48:41.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
