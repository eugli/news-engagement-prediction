I do not have the power to make laws which forbid people to put pineapples on their pizza. I am glad that I do not hold such power,” Johannesson said. “Presidents should not have unlimited power. I would not want to hold this position if I could pass laws forbidding that which I don’t like. I would not want to live in such a country.” \nOf course, while he tried to put the pineapple protests to rest, he may have also ignited the next Twitter topic by stating, “For pizzas, I recommend seafood.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:32:41.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
