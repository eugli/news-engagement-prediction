This time, it was George Clooney—ardent defender of democratic principles, free speech, and Meryl Streep —who took to the stage in Paris on Friday night at the 42nd annual César awards to accept an honorary accolade and to share a few thoughts on our current political climate. (He also, in a swoon-worthy moment, addressed his pregnant wife in the audience, resplendent in feathered Versace , saying how proud he was to be her husband and that he was “excited about the years, and especially the months, to come.”) “I was thinking about Edward R. Murrow,” Clooney said, referencing the legendary broadcast journalist and subject of his 2005 film Good Night, and Good Luck, “as we find ourselves nostalgic for when America was great and when the news wasn’t fake.” Earlier today, select outlets were barred from attending the daily White House Press briefing, among them The New York Times, CNN, and Buzzfeed, after Trump labeled the press as enemies of the American people, and vowed to “do something about it.” “We must not confuse dissent for disloyalty,” Clooney said, quoting Murrow. “We must not walk in fear of one another. We must not be driven by fear into an age of unreason.” He cautioned that, “We’re going to have to work harder and harder not to let hate win,” and that people must counter the lesser instincts of the current administration with the opposite: “Love Trump’s hate, courage Trump’s fear, and always right Trump’s wrongs.” Of Trump himself, Clooney said, “The actions of this president have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad and given considerable comfort to our enemies. . . . And whose fault is that?” he asked. “Not really his. He didn’t create this situation of fear, he merely exploited it, and rather successfully.” Clooney ended by quoting Shakespeare. “Cassius was right,” he said. “‘The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in our stars, but in ourselves.’ ” He then added Murrow’s famous sign-off: “Goodnight and good luck.” That’s one heck of an act to follow, come Sunday .
