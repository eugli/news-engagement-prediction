Hickory St. His arms, face and torso were painted black. when police told him about the phone calls reporting he was in the roadway, Augustini said, “I know the law, I am the law!” When asked his name, the man repeatedly said,“I’m allowed to break the law,” according to police. \nThe officers feared Joseph was going to act violently, since he told all the officers on scene to take off their guns because it was not a “fair fight”. Augustini was holding a clear glass pipe with residue in it that tested positive for amphetamines. Augustini is currently in the Denton City Jail charged with Public Intoxication and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia. \nHe is being held on a $500 bond for each charge. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.   rewritten, or redistributed.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:11:07.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
