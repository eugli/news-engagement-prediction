(Photo: NBA Photo Library, NBAE/Getty Images) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nDeep down, underneath that rugged Oscar Robertson veneer that has been there since his days growing up in an all-black neighborhood in Indianapolis some seven decades ago, there’s a strong sense of pride just begging to be let out. \nAnd this is about much more than the Hall of Famer’s celebrated status as the NBA’s triple-double king. \nFor all the focus on the Oklahoma City Thunder’s Russell Westbrook and whether he can join Robertson as the only other player to average a triple-double for a season, the 78-year-old’s influence on the game was much more meaningful than the milestone he reached in the 1961-62 campaign with the Cincinnati Royals. \nAll it takes is a glance at the league’s latest headlines to be reminded of that much. \nHe is the godfather of NBA free agency, having fought for players’ rights in U.S. District Court from 1970 to 1976, only to smile every time someone such as LeBron James or Kevin Durant exercises his free will all these years later. Saturday, in Durant’s first return to Oklahoma City since signing with the Golden State Warriors in July, it’s a reality worth remembering when all those boos rain down. \nAs his fame grew throughout the Civil Rights era, from those 10 seasons in Cincinnati to his time with the Milwaukee Bucks that led to a title alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then Lew Alcindor) in 1971, he became one of the forefathers of African-American stardom in a league that was changing for the better. A half century later, when he saw James, Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony unite on the ESPYs stage to shed light on the Black Lives Matter movement in October or heard James speak out on his wish list for the Cleveland Cavaliers roster last week, Robertson cherishes this new sports world in which the player’s voice has long since been unleashed. \nSo yes, in other words, Westbrook’s exploits are a good excuse to reflect on Robertson’s greatness on the court. But the truth, one that Robertson reflected on in a recent chat with USA TODAY Sports, is that he’s a living legend for reasons far more profound than his ability to fill up a box score. Today’s NBA, a booming business in which some maximum-salary players will make upwards of $30 million next season as a direct result of the nine-year, $24 billion television rights deal signed with ESPN and Turner in October 2014, wouldn’t be the same without him. \nGALLERY: NBA TRIPLE-DOUBLE TRACKER A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 64.
