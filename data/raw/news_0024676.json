Share via Twitter Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images A new Oklahoma abortion bill would prevent women from having abortions unless they've received written permission from the man who impregnated them. The bill, House Bill 1441 , was recently proposed by Oklahoma representative Justin Humphrey. HB1441 states that no abortion can be legally performed in the state without \"written informed consent [from] the father of the fetus.\" The bill would also require a pregnant woman to identify the man who impregnated her in writing so that he can give or deny permission for the abortion—or challenge the fact that he's the father at all (in which case he would demand a paternity test). Women who have become pregnant as a result of rape or incest would be excused from this rule. Another exception would apply in cases where the man who fertilized the pregnancy has died. If that happened, the pregnant woman would be required to provide a notarized affidavit attesting to his death. Women whose lives are endangered as a result of being pregnant would also be allowed to get an abortion without the father's consent, as long as a physician determines that carrying the pregnancy to term would be life-threatening. (Worth noting: The line between life or death can be difficult to determine. When does a dangerous pregnancy become a life-threatening one? The truth is: It's hard to tell. And sometimes doctors aren't able to determine how dangerous a pregnancy was until it's too late .) Remember: HB1441 isn't a law yet. Right now, it's just a bill—and it will stay that way until the state legislature takes the next steps to push it forward. But if the bill does become law, experts say it could be really bad for women. \"Oklahoma is legislating reproductive coercion when it should be outlawing it and protecting teens and women,\" Mercedes Sanchez, director of communications and education at Cedar River Clinics, tells SELF. \"For teens experiencing child abuse and women experiencing domestic violence, this law will empower their abusers to use the courts as a weapon to further control and terrorize them.\" And Julie A. Burkhart, founder and CEO of reproductive rights foundation Trust Women, adds, \"A woman must be able to make personal decisions based on what is best for her circumstances. We must trust and honor a woman's ability to make complex decisions regarding pregnancy.\" Not to mention, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that requiring this kind of partner consent for abortions is unconstitutional. In the 1976 case Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth , the court struck down legislation that required a pregnant woman to get permission to have an abortion from her spouse (or her parents, if she were a minor). The court struck down similar spousal notice requirements in 1992's Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey . If Oklahoma decides to pass HB1441, a legal battle challenging the bill's constitutionality is possible. Feeling motivated to act? There are tons of ways to make your voice heard. SELF's resources on finding activist opportunities and getting involved in policy decisions are great places to start. And if you're passionate about women's access to reproductive health care in particular, you can also consider: donating to the Center for Reproductive Rights , volunteering for NARAL Pro-Choice America , donating to the Reproductive Health Access Project , or volunteering for Planned Parenthood .
