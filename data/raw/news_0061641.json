On February 11, she landed in Mumbai. Her cavalcade included an ambulance and a police escort following her truck. \nA similar procedure had to be carried out in reverse to get her into the specially modified room at Saifee Hospital where a crane first lowered her bed onto a wide balcony. It was then wheeled into a customised room which will be her home for at least six months. \nEman was born weighing 6.3kg and diagnosed with elephantiasis. By the time she was 11, she was too heavy to support her weight standing up. After Year 5, she had to stop going to school. Ad Feedback \n\"The last time she was 'mobile' was when she used to crawl around the home because she simply couldn't stand. For the past 10 years, she has been bedridden,\" Lakdawala said. \nEman's mother sews clothes for a living and her sister Shaimaa, an engineer, left her job to look after her. Her father died six months ago. \nFor the battalion of doctors treating her, the challenge is managing her multiple ailments. \n\"The target is to reduce her weight by 200 kilos in six months. This will involve bariatric surgery to reduce the size of her stomach. But before we can do that, we have to make her safe for surgery,\" Lakdawala said. \nCurrently, Eman is battling hypothyroidism, malfunctioning kidneys, hypertension, gout, sleep apnea, diabetes, and hyperthyroidism, to name only the main problems. She is on a liquid diet. She struggles to swallow and speak owing to the stroke. \nMembers of Lakdawala's team, including three nephrologists​, went to Egypt to start her treatment in January so that she could be fit to travel. They put her on a 1200-calorie diet and medication to control her clinical abnormalities. She has already lost 30kg. (Special scales that can take up to 1000kg are being used). \nLakdawala said the immediate priority was to reduce her weight by another 30-40kg, lower her blood pressure and stabilise her heart rate and liver. \nFor Lakdawala, a top US-trained surgeon who heads the Centre for Obesity and Digestive Surgery at Saifee Hospital, Eman represents the biggest challenge of his career. \nAlthough he has operated on two people who weighed around 300kg, her extra kilos make surgery risky. He had no hesitation in taking her on when her desperate family contacted him after having run out of options in Egypt. \nBut her visa proved to be a problem. The Indian embassy in Cairo expects applicants to visit the embassy in person in order to take their fingerprints. This was out of the question for Eman. \nWhen the embassy refused to give her a visa, Lakdawala asked Foreign Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to make an exception. She told the embassy to waive the rules to give Eman a visa. \nLakdawala is not charging any fees but even then, the total cost of travel and prolonged treatment is far beyond the family's means. Shaimaa, who has accompanied her, has been raising funds to cover the costs and the hospital has launched a Save Eman campaign asking for donations. The cause, which has a goal of 500,000 rupees (NZ$104,000), had raised about NZ$40,826 at time of writing. \nA large chunk of this came from Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan​'s mother Pinky Roshan who was so moved when she read about Eman being confined to her room for 20 years that she contributed the equivalent of NZ$20,000. \nBollywood films are very popular among Egyptians and Eman is no exception. \n\"She watches films in her room. She can't understand the language but she loves the music and the beat of Hindi film music,\" Lakdawala said. \nWhen she expressed a desire to meet Indian superstar Salman Khan, the news reached him and, according to media reports, he is happy to meet her. - Sydney Morning Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:56:59.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
