Article continues below \nWhile Madrid deserve plenty of credit for the turnaround, there was plenty of luck on their side - most notably in the award of the penalty for their second goal. \nGareth Bale’s header got Madrid back into the game before referee Gil Manzano awarded the away side a controversial penalty. Article continues below \nIn the 73rd minute, Manzano pointed to the penalty spot when the ball struck Villarreal defender Bruno in the box. It was extremely harsh but Cristiano Ronaldo didn’t need a second invitation to level the scores from 12 yards. \nAlvaro Morata then secured all three points with a header nine minutes later. \nThe comeback must have been infuriating for Barcelona, especially considering the penalty incident. In fact, it was so infuriating that Gerard Pique couldn’t help but tweet his anger. \nHe wrote: \"Against the same teams. 8 points (swing). Clips from the Madrid press,\" in response to the difference in decisions that Barcelona and Real Madrid get. \nAnd now, Pique and Barcelona might be have another reason to be annoyed with the officials during the match. Villarreal president's claims \nThat’s because, according to the Villarreal president, the referee and his two assistants were seen with \"Real Madrid bags” after the game. \n\"I saw Gil Manzano and his assistants leave the stadium holding Real Madrid bags. That's not right, it seems to me,” Fernando Roig told the press a few hours after the match. as per AS . \nWe’re not quite sure what sort of ‘bags’ these were as no photos have emerged. Either way, it’s an alarming claim by Roig. \nRoig went on to comment about the award of the penalty - which you won’t be surprised to discover that he didn’t agree with. \n\"You all know about this,” fumed Roig. “It didn’t hit him totally on the hand, but on the shoulder and the arm. It came from a rebound off a teammate. I don’t think it was a penalty. \n“I don’t know if he sees yellow better than white. \n“[The penalty decision] killed the game. It is necessary to clarify if a ricochet is a penalty or not. I do not think so. \n\"It was a great reaction [by Madrid], but we’re not talking about an unfair penalty that has allowed them to come back. I have not said anything to Gil Manzano. He knows what he has to do. A ricochet is not a handball.” \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
