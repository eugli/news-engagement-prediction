Samantha Gee reports. \nWhen Nelson parents Niki and Chris Saunders first heard about the human papillomavirus​ (HPV) vaccine, they saw it as a way to safeguard both their sons and their future partners from developing cancer. \nThe Saunders spent over $1000 on their sons' vaccinations before it became publicly funded. They now hope it will be more accessible and remove the financial barrier for others. \nWhen Niki first heard about the vaccine, it was a conversation she didn't look forward to as it meant asking her sons questions about their sexual activity. \n\"It was excruciatingly horrible for both them and me but I just had to ask the questions.\"' \nREAD MORE: * 10 years on, HPV vaccine halves cervical cancer rates \nBut she thought the uncomfortable discussion was worth it if it prevented them, or a future partner, from developing cervical, anal or throat cancer. \n\"It shouldn't always fall to the one sex, both sexes should be able to take some responsibility,\" Niki said. \n\"Especially when they are able to pass something on.\" \nLast week, health minister Jonathan Coleman announced that a new vaccine, Gardasil​ 9 would be available free to year 8 girls and boys through an extension to the school immunisation programme. Ad Feedback \nIt contains protection against additional strains of HPV compared to Gardasil, which was launched in 2008 to protect girls. \nThe vaccine had also been available for boys, who transmit the virus and can develop head, neck or anal cancer. However it came at a cost of around $500 and uptake had been low. \nNiki said she didn't know of many other parents whose children had been vaccinated but she knew the timing was crucial and the vaccine was most effective when it was administered before someone became sexually active. \n\" How awful would it be to know that you had possibly killed your wife by giving her cancer and they hadn't caught it in time, that would be dreadful,\" Niki said. \n\"I thought well, I don't want to wait, because getting cancer could be deadly\" \nShe first heard about HPV after watching a current affairs show where a man had developed severe throat cancer as a result of the virus. \nMinistry of Health acting director of public health Niki Stefanogiannis​ said there was no data on the number of boys vaccinated before 2017 as such records were kept by individual GP practices. \nOver 700,000 HPV vaccines had been administered in New Zealand since 2008. Previously, people needed three doses to be fully immunised. \nStefanogiannis said 54.7 per cent of girls born between 1990 and 2003 had been fully immunised against HPV. A further 5 per cent of the eligible population had received either one or two doses and were partially immunised. \nShe said cervical cancer was the most common cancer caused by HPV, along with an increasing proportion of throat cancers in men. \nNelson GP Dr Claire Thurlow​ confirmed the uptake had been low among boys. Out of 2000 patients at the general practice Thurlow worked at only four males had been vaccinated. \n\"The important thing to understand about HPV is that it is generally an asymptomatic virus. So people don't know they have it and over time, if it is undetected and untreated, it becomes cancer. \" \nHPV could also cause genital warts and Thurlow said since the vaccination was introduced she has seen a significant reduction in genital warts during sexual health clinics. \n\"There is evidence to show that even just the girls being vaccinated are protecting the boys. \n\"In the future we would be hoping to see a reduction of head and neck cancers in boys.\" \nThurlow said there hadn't been a great uptake of the vaccination even though it was designed to prevent cancer. \n\"I think if we did have a vaccination for breast cancer you would have heaps of people jumping on board to do this.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T13:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T11:43:44.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
