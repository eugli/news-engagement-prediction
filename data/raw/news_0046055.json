A post shared by Healthy Paleo Chef (@chefpeteevans) on Feb 16, 2017 at 12:44pm PST \nAccording to the caption her breakfast is “Organic eggs, broccolini, bacon, lettuce, avocado, fish eggs, kraut and the eggs are topped with chimmichurri”. \n“The girls’ favourite food is fish eggs so we get a jar every week as a treat from @yarvalleycaviar and they have a teaspoon on their breakfasts a few days a week,” the post continues, adding: “Indulgence doesn’t always have to mean sweet!” \nTo be fair though, this does look pretty delicious, and you’ve got to give him points for making his kid something healthy in the morning. A post shared by Healthy Paleo Chef (@chefpeteevans) on Feb 16, 2017 at 7:31pm PST \nNot to mention, it’s timely. \nNutrition experts have today called for a nationally co-ordinated approach to tackle the country’s obesity problem and improve the health of Australians. \nA study of 100 experts from 53 organisations conducted a landmark study on junk food consumption in the country, pushing for a national strategy to improve people’s diets — including Aussie children’s. \nThe study could see junk food banned from schools and sports venues, with the researchers saying reducing young people’s exposure to junk food was important. \nThat said, we secretly hope Indii gets to enjoy a Wagon Wheel or two in-between all those organic greens.
