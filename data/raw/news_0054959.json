Banning men from approaching women isn't the answer to our sexual harassment problem \nBuffy has hundreds of fans in her hometown of Bicester, Oxfordshire, and even gets regular requests for selfies from online admirers who are having bad days and need cheering up. \nThe pure breed Jack Russell’s owner Jill Cox first noticed her pampered pooch smiling four years ago and said her pet gives her massive grins dozens of times a day. \nMarried mum-of-two Jill said she has thousands of pictures of Buffy beaming – which she is often forced to show to the hound’s devotees to prove her grin hasn’t been digitally altered. (Picture: Mercury Press) \nThe 49-year-old, a career and school cleaner, said: ‘We call Buffy Queen Buffy – she is a bit of a celebrity and absolutely everyone knows her for her smile. \n‘She is very well-known round our area and the local parks and she also has hundreds of fans online who love to see her pictures, she even has her own Facebook page. \n‘She is absolutely always smiling, she must be the world’s smiliest dog. She does it dozens of times a day – when she’s asleep, awake, in the garden, waiting for her food. \n‘We first noticed her smile four years ago, in 2013, when she was asleep one day. I just noticed and said to my husband ‘I’m sure she is smiling’. \n‘Suddenly she woke up and gave me this most amazing smile, I just managed to capture it on camera. Now we have thousands of pictures of her grinning at us – it is just hilarious.’ (Picture: Mercury Press) \nJill is convinced that Buffy has always smiled a lot and that she just hadn’t picked up on it before. ‘Now when I look back on some old pictures of her I can see the smile there,’ she said. \n‘Everyone notices her smile and people keep asking where it comes from. But lots of people have even asked me if the pictures of her are photoshopped. They don’t believe her smile could be real and ask to see more pictures to prove it. \n‘People ask me to send pictures of her to make them feel better if they are having a really bad day. She just has this special quality about her that really cheers everyone up.’ \nBuffy, who has lived with Kill and her husband Dave Cox, 53, since she was just eight weeks old, will celebrate her 14th birthday this September. \nAnd she’ll have lots to smile about when she does – as she’s always spoilt with an annual birthday cake just for her. (Picture: Mercury Press) \nJill said: ‘Some people think it is just something she does with her mouth but I think Buffy’s smile is a genuine smile in the same way a human would smile – when she does it you can see she is happy.
