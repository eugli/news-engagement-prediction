It warns, however, that ‘developing successful trade and investment links with faster-growing emerging economies will be critical’ following Brexit. The report comes days after the Bank of England admitted it was far too gloomy about the outlook for Brexit Britain. The Bank last week said the economy was set to grow by 2 per cent again this year – more than double the 0.8 per cent rate of expansion it forecast in August. Crossrail (pictured) which is due to open in 2018 will speed the time it takes to get from Heathrow to central London and is expected to create significant growth along its route It marked a humiliating U-turn for Governor Mark Carney who before the referendum warned a vote to leave could tip the economy into recession. ‘Growth has been markedly stronger since the middle of 2016 than projected in August,’ the Bank admitted. Kevin Dowd, professor of finance and economics at Durham University, said: ‘The UK economy will do better precisely because of Brexit – not despite it. ‘The reason why the economy will do better after Brexit is because we won’t have the stifling regulations of the single market and we have the opportunity to go for free trade deals with the rest of the world. ‘We can make new trade arrangements with the United States and others. This is potentially a very great benefit for the economy. ‘The Treasury, the Bank of England and lots of the big outfits got it completely wrong. ‘The Treasury’s Brexit report was an absolute farce. The Bank of England also said the world would end if we voted to leave. But it has now revised its view.’ Former chancellor George Osborne, the chief architect of Project Fear, said a vote to leave the European Union ‘would represent an immediate and profound shock to our economy’. In the so-called ‘dossier of doom’ published before the referendum in June, the Treasury said the economy would suffer a punishing year-long recession following a Brexit vote. House prices in central London have fallen by up to 14 percent in just 12 months following a tax raid by Mr Osborne. He raised stamp duty on homes worth more than £937,500 in late 2014 – hitting swathes of housing in the capital. Estate agent Knight Frank yesterday said average prices in central London fell 6.7 per cent in the year to January and by up to 14 per cent in the area north of Hyde Park.
