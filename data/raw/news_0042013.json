The Prime Minister is particularly critical of the South Australian Government for what he describes as the SA Government's renewable energy scheme — but who's responsible here? \nThe report said the Federal Government was standing on the shoulders of the states to meet its 2030 carbon emissions target and urged the Coalition to reconsider adopting an emissions intensity scheme, to reduceemissions from the electricity sector. \nThe Federal Government is using its Direct Action policy, the Emissions Reduction Fund, its Safeguard Mechanism and the Renewable Energy Target to reduce emissions to 26-28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030. \nBut Mr Price said the states and territories were doing the heavy lifting. \n\"If nothing changes in terms of current policy settings, that is that those state targets go ahead, we actually achieve the 28 per cent reduction with no national policy and I figure that the national Government must know this,\" Mr Price told ABC's AM. \nMr Price said Australia's electricity grid was fit for a first-world country — but not for long. \n\"We are heading towards a third-world power system very rapidly,\" he said. \n\"And it's very hard to arrest a decline in the quality of our power system.\" \nMr Price is currently advising the South Australian State Government. \nHe has assisted the development of the Australian electricity market rules and in 2009 helped create an emissions trading scheme policy for then Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull and independent senator Nick Xenophon.
