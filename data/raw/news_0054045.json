Despite attempts to save his life, the victim did not survive his injuries. Story continues below \nAt the same time, the Integrated Road Safety Unit (IRSU) saw a suspect vehicle flee the area and when police tried to pull it over, the driver continued to speed away. With some help from the Mission RCMP, the vehicle was eventually stopped with the use of a spike belt. Three men were taken into custody in Abbotsford. \nThe victim’s death was deemed a homicide and the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) has taken over the case. \n“It is still early in the investigation, and investigators are trying to determine what involvement, if any, the three males had in the homicide,” IHIT’s Cpl. Meghan Foster said in a statement. \nFoster says they have since been released from custody, and are not facing any criminal charges. \nThe male victim has been identified as Satkar Singh Sidhu. Although Sidhu did not have a criminal record, he was known to police. From the evidence gathered so far by IHIT, police believe Sidhu’s murder was targeted and linked to other gang violence in the Lower Mainland. \n“This homicide was a brazen shooting that occurred in a quiet residential neighbourhood, and fortunately no one else was hurt,” Foster said. \nAnyone with information is asked to contact the IHIT Information Line at 1-877-551-IHIT (4448), or Crime Stoppers. \nWATCH: A gang war in the Townline Hill area of Abbotsford appears to have flared up again, with a deadly shooting and police chase that ended with arrests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:48:25.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
