Really, if Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are important to your project, you're probably better off getting a full-sized Pi... until today. Now the Pi Zero W has arrived , and it changes the whole game .\nThe Pi Zero W adds the same 802.11n and Bluetooth 4.0 wireless chip the Pi 3 Model B has, but in that deliciously small Pi Zero form factor, and for only $5 more. I know it sounds like I'm trying to sell you one of these, but really I'm just regretting my recent purchase of a Pi Zero starter kit, USB hub, Wi-Fi dongle, and Bluetooth dongle. At least my HDMI adapter is still useful!\nOtherwise the board is the same as the Pi Zero: a single-core 1GHz CPU, 512MB of RAM, and plenty of I/O for hacking.\nYou can get a Pi Zero W today if you can find one in stock anywhere, but they're disappearing fast. The good news is the Raspberry Pi Foundation usually, eventually, catches up with demand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:49:27.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
