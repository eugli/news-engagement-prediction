Basically, it’s the Republican answer to Glastonbury, but with concealed carry permits instead of peace signs and Donald Trump headlining in place of Florence and the Machine. This year’s conference, which begins today at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in Maryland, has been shrouded in controversy after organisers were forced to disinvite Milo Yiannopoulos following the far-right provocateur’s widely reported remarks on older men having relationships with younger boys. While Milo might not be appearing at CPac, there’s still plenty of rightwing rhetoric to go around. Here are some of the highlights: \nThursday \n9.30am Fake Climate News Camouflaging an Anti-Capitalist Agenda – And What President Trump Plans To Do About It \nTalk sponsored by the charming folks at Energy and Environment Legal Institute, an organisation that litigiously pursues climate scientists . \n11am Fake News and the Lame Stream Media \nIf you had “lame stream media” in “Republican buzzword bingo”, please mark your card. \n11.30am FREE stuff vs FREE-dom: Millenials’ Love Affair with Bernie Sanders \nThe right tries to understand what millennials want, all while being unable to spell the world millennial. \n4.40pm Banning Poor People From Jobs \nPresumably not a guide to doing it, though you never know.
