GIRL IN LIFT, PUNCHES EX-GF FOR ALLEGEDLY REPORTING HIM TO POLICE   Thu, 02/02/2017 - 3:46pm \nAn unemployed man, Budiman Tarmidi, 25, was charged in court on Tuesday for outraging the modesty of a 15 year-old girl he had seen at a mini-mart, and for assaulting his ex-girlfriend on her way home 9 days after the molestation. \nAccording to court proceedings, Budiman had met the victim at the mini-mart where he stared at her lewdly. The 15 year-old ignored him and headed home. Budiman followed her home and asked for her name. She replied with a fake name out of fear. Undeterred, he entered into the lift with her and stood behind her, groping her buttocks 3 to 4 times. Advertisement \nThe girl, with no one to seek help from, endured the humiliation and rushed out as soon as the door opened. She informed her sister of the crime, who reported the incident to the police. \nBudiman was arrested a week later and produced in court on June 8. \nOn the same day of his court appearance, Budiman sent a WhatsApp message to his ex-girlfriend, Ms Rinadiana Rafa'at, 27, and accused her of reporting his whereabouts to the police, which caused him to be arrested. She denied this, but Budiman sought her out and assaulted her violently. \nAt the void deck of Block 371 Jurong East Street 32, Budiman approached her aggressively, dragged her aside and rained blows on her face repeatedly using his fists and knees. Budiman only retreated when 2 of Rinadiana's friends turned up. \nFor outrage of modesty, Budiman faces up to 2 years jail, a fine, caning or a combination of punishments. For assault, he faces up to 2 years jail and/or a fine of up to $5,000. Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
