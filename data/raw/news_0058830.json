We need to clarify one thing — abortion is a big deal,” she continued.\nAutumn goes on to describe some of the gifts suggested by Teen Vogue, and wonders how some of them would actually be able to allow these girls who have been through something so traumatic, or how killing their baby is a good example of “girl power.”\n“By the way, how many aborted babies have been girls?” asks Autumn. “What about their rights? When do girls begin to have power? And how powerful do you have to be to destroy the most helpless of people? To me, abortion seems like the opposite of girl power.”\n“If you know someone who has had an abortion, don’t buy them a gag gift and disguise it as a celebration,” says Autumn. “Treat it for what it is. A terrible loss.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:56:04.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
