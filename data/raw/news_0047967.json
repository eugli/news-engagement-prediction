Sunday is Monday here in the UAE and its back to work for all, and, so too, for Peshawar Zalmi and the Karachi Kings. The two sides meet up at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium in the only match of the day, or rather, night in the HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL), looking to climb up the ladder. That thrilling last-ball loss to the defending champions Islamabad United late on Saturday night, would have hurt Peshawar Zalmi but they have little time to sulk as the turnaround is too short. Just 24 hours after tasting that disappointing defeat, Peshawar Zalmi will be back on the turf to do battle against the Karachi Kings. They had a chance to go level on top of the table with the Quetta Gladiators but a low total for the chase, undid that. But then, in Peshawar Zalmi's defence, it must be said that they stretched Islamabad United all the way, right until the line. And that would have heartened their captain Darren Sammy. There is still work to do though as there are still some missing pieces. Sunday's game will mark Eoin Morgan's last with the Zalmis this season as the England limited-overs captain bids goodbye before embarking on the tour of the West Indies. And Peshawar Zalmi and Morgan will be hoping it will be in good circumstances. With Morgan set to depart after this game, supplementary player Alex Hales will come into the reckoning. But that's for another day. Meanwhile, after hitting the runway, the Karachi Kings will be looking to take flight. After three defeats, Kumar Sangakkara's men finally got on the board with that Duckworth Lewis victory over Islamabad United. The Karachi Kings don't have any England player departing but one of the creases on their foreheads would be that of Chris Gayle. The 'Universal Boss' is yet to light up this edition and he might just as well take a cue from fellow T20 globetrotter Kevin Pietersen, who muscled Quetta Gladiators against the Lahore Qalandars, the other night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T09:47:53.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
