Daniel Radcliffe appeared in Swiss Army Man , Now You See Me 2 and Imperium last year, Emma Watson will be seen as Belle in the Beauty of the Beast remake, the list goes on. In the case of Scarlett Byrne, who played Slytherin Pansy Parkinson in three of the Harry Potter movies, she's also kept up her acting career, but she'll also soon be seen in the pages of Playboy. A post shared by scarlett (@scarleybyrne) on Feb 13, 2017 at 2:12pm PST \nScarlett Byrne announced on her Instagram page recently that she wrote an essay called \"The Feminist Mystique\" that will be featured within the magazine's March/April issue. Along with that, and in keeping with what Playboy is best known for, she'll also be modeling nude, including the hashtag #NakedIsNormal in her post, which is the title of that issue. Last year, Playboy announced they would discontinue showing nude photographs, but earlier this week, it was announced that this creative decision had been overturned, returning the publication to its roots. So Byrne will be one of the first models in this relaunch of sorts. It's also worth noting that Byrne is engaged to Cooper Hefner, son of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner and the magazine's Chief Creative Officer. \nLike her book counterpart, the cinematic Pansy Parkinson was a recurring player throughout the Harry Potter franchise, though she wasn't seen in The Goblet of Fire movie. However, Scarlett Byrne didn't start playing her until 2009's Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince , a role which she reprised for the Deathly Hallows movies. That said, like the previous actresses, Byrne wasn't given a lot to do, as Parkinson was really just one of the Slytherin students hanging around with Draco Malfoy who liked to tease all of the main and supporting benevolent characters. You know, what you usually expect from the average Slytherin. Here's a picture of Byrne's Pansy in case you forgot her lingering about. \nOutside of the Harry Potter movies, Scarlett Byrne's most notable credits have been playing Lexi Denise Glass-Mason in the TNT series Falling Skies and Nora Hildegard in The Vampire Diaries . She was most recently seen on an episode of Mary + Jane , and she'll also appear in Skybound . But if you want to see a more exposed side of Byrne (bad pun, sorry), as well as read her thoughts about feminism, check out the upcoming Playboy issue. \nThe Harry Potter movies series is over (unless there's ever a Cursed Child adaptation ), but the exploration of the Wizarding World is continuing through the Fantastic Beasts series, the next installment of which hits theaters on November 16, 2018.
