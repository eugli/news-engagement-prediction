Yet trade experts at an event on Wednesday organised by the UK Trade Policy Observatory (UKTPO) in London said that while it might be legally possible to conclude such bespoke customs arrangements this would not eliminate the need for firms to demonstrate to customs officers that they were exempt from rules of origin and various product standards checks, and that this would inevitably lead to considerable disruption relative to the current frictionless cross-border goods trade with the EU.\n“Having a certificate doesn’t mean it doesn’t have to be checked,” said Jim Rollo, deputy director of the UKTPO.\n“There has to be some check or everyone else [crossing the border] claims they’ve got the certificate.”\nMr Rollo said estimates for the additional cost for firms facing rules of origin tests on exports ranged from an increase between 1 per cent to 10 per cent.\nBut he stressed that even exemption from these tests would not mean frictionless movement of goods after leaving the customs union and that this would almost certainly lead to queues of lorries at borders.\n“The point is not whether we need [exemption certificates] or not but whether we can prove [it] when we meet a customs officer. It’s the time spent in queues that’s the really expensive bit – that’s wages and depreciation of lorries.”\nTurkey has its own customs union with the EU – eliminating the need for tariffs and standards checks on goods imported into the EU - yet lorries regularly have to queue for more than 14 hours at the Turkey-Bulgaria land border.\n“There may be elements of rent that are being collected in these queues…[and] there may be things you can do by [checking] one lorry in five…but having the certification doesn’t mean it doesn’t have to be checked,” said Mr Rollo.\nFederico Ortino of King’s College London and Clifford Chance said an analogy for UK firms would be the disruption currently faced by British citizens when they travel to the rest of the EU versus EU citizens who move around the bloc’s passport-free Schengen zone.\nRead more Government admits there will be no cherry-picking on EU customs union May says Britain will not remain full member of EU customs union Fox: UK 'must look at all options' including staying in customs union “There will be a longer queue for those who are not in the EU and a shorter queue for those that are part of the EU. The border hasn’t disappeared,” he said.\nThe British car industry, which has deeply integrated pan-European supply chains for components, has been particularly alarmed by the implications of leaving the customs union.\nEmily Lydgate of the University of Sussex said there are two kinds of EU border checks: one for rules of origin, checking tariff have been paid and the other one for checking EU regulatory requirements have been met.\n“I don’t see how we can eliminate the need for those checks even if we have agreements for certain sectors,” she said.\nMs May plans to trigger the two-year Article 50 divorce process from the EU by the end of next Month.\nTrade experts have warned that the EU are unlikely to even start discussing issues such as a new trade terms and customs arrangements until the divorce bill has been agreed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:25:30.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
