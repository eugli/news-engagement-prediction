The phone can be seen in the render in a Green and Black color which suggests that Xiaomi will have at least two color options of the Redmi Note 4X available for consumers where the phone goes on sale. There hasn’t been any leaks of the device design up until now, but previous rumors have mentioned that the device will look mostly the same when it comes to the design and that Xiaomi wouldn’t be changing the look of the phone. This leak would seem to support that rumor as the device in the picture does look just like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 \nIf this is the case then the Redmi Note 4X is likely to be a step above the Redmi Note 4 on the hardware side of things and will seek to set itself apart from the original model by offering potentially better specs. It’s also entirely possible that this image could be just a new color of the Redmi Note 4, though it’s more likely that it’s a leaked render of the newer model given Xiaomi is close to announcing the phone officially. Yesterday’s teaser that was released onto the web mentions Valentine’s Day, which some think might suggest the day that Xiaomi is planning to unveil the phone, but the numbers 2 and 8 at the bottom of that picture would seem to suggest the actual unveiling date of February 8th. That being said Valentine’s Day could be the time that Xiaomi plans to put the Redmi Note 4X up for sale. \nIn addition to today’s leaked render with the possible phone design, the Redmi Note 4X specifications appear to have leaked earlier this morning in a new TENAA certification filing, showcasing that Xiaomi looks to have used a Snapdragon 625 processor inside and that the phone will come with 4GB of RAM and a 5.5-inch Full HD screen. Rumors also suggest that the Redmi Note 4X could run on either Android 6.0 Marshmallow or Android 7.0 Nougat under the latest MIUI software build, and that it will have a 13-megapixel rear camera along with a fairly large 4100mAh battery.
