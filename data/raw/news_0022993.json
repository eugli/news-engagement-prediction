Kodi is a free service that streams apps and on-demand services onto your TV.\nThe software, which is legal, can even be downloaded onto an Amazon Fire stick.\nBlank boxes can be bought from most major retailers for as little as £20, with the software uploaded afterwards.\nUsers can play BBC iPlayer, Youtube, Soundcloud and other free catch-up apps on the device.\nBut many of the plug-ins the box offers are illegal.\nBe wary if the box is pre-loaded to include subscription sport, TV and movies for free.\nCommonly the 'fully loaded' boxes let users watch Premier League games or Sky Movies without paying a subscription fee.\nKieron Sharp, Director General of FACT, said: 'Today's day of action should send out a clear warning to anyone involved in the sale and distribution of illegal set-top boxes that law enforcement and industry take this matter very seriously.\n'Set-top boxes loaded with apps and add-ons allowing access to copyright infringing material are very much illegal and anyone involved in selling these boxes should not be surprised to receive a knock on the door.'\nFACT has no estimate of how many UK residents own the Kodi software.\nJo Johnson, Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation, said: 'Profiting from illegal streaming is completely unacceptable. The UK's creative industries are a national asset that must be protected.\n'Today's efforts have shown that partnership works. I wish to congratulate FACT and the police for ending these criminal operations.'\nThis isn't the first time that someone has been arrested for selling 'fully loaded' Kodi boxes.\nThe boxes are legal to use but can have illegal streaming services downloaded on them\nBrian Thompson, 54, from Middlesborough, is being prosecuted by Middlesborough Council on suspicion of selling Kodi boxes from his shop Cut Price Tomo TVs. He will stand trial in May\nTerry O'Reilly, 53, was handed a four-year sentence in December 2016.\nHe is believed to have made more than £1million by selling more than 1,000 of the streaming boxes to pubs.\nThey were used to stream Premier League matches for free.\nWill O'Leary, who worked with O'Reilly, was given a two-year suspended sentence after he pleaded guilty.\nBrian Thompson, 54, is being prosecuted by Middlesborough Council on suspicion of selling Kodi boxes from his shop Cut Price Tomo TVs.\nHe will stand trial in May.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:25:17.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
