Because ultimately, I believe, Wichita State will win the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament and secure the league’s automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament . \nBut what if the Shockers ... don’t ? \nWhat if they slip? \nOr what if a capable Illinois State team beats them in St. Louis? \nWhat would the NCAA Tournament selection committee do with Gregg Marshall’s team then? What should it do then? That’s what this column is about. And I guess I’ll start by stating my opinion before explaining it, and my opinion is this: Playing an NCAA Tournament without a Wichita State team that would be (in this hypothetical situation) 29-5 with only two losses in the 12 weeks leading up to Selection Sunday would be ridiculous and fundamentally unfair. \nThat’s the simplest way to put it. \nAnd, please, don’t talk to me about Wichita State’s lack of so-called quality wins — because that’s exactly what I’m talking about. Yes, I know, the Shockers have only one top-50 RPI win, and that’s obviously less than ideal. But they’ve only had five opportunities to land top-50 RPI wins, and three came before some folks even started Christmas shopping — not to mention while Wichita State was still figuring out what it was after losing three starters from last season’s team that won 29 games and beat Vanderbilt and Arizona in the NCAA Tournament. \nAgain, Wichita State lost three starters from last season’s team. Evan Wessel \nTwo of those players were three-year starters who are in the NBA . So should it really be surprising that the Shockers didn’t look in November like they look today? They lost two games to projected NCAA Tournament teams (Louisville, Michigan State) three months ago with a reshaped roster, and that’s the only thing between them and a resume that would have Wichita State safely in the field of 68 regardless of how things go at Arch Madness. In other words, some of the world’s best bracketologists, including CBS Sports’ Jerry Palm, are prepared to label Wichita State unworthy if Wichita State doesn’t secure the MVC’s automatic bid — largely because of the outcomes of games played during Thanksgiving weekend. \nWith all due respect, that’s silly. \nEverybody can acknowledge Oklahoma State isn’t the same team it was when the Cowboys started 0-6 in the Big 12. And everybody can admit Indiana isn’t the same team now that it was when the Hoosiers started 8-1 with wins over Kansas and North Carolina. \nSome teams get better with time. \nOthers get worse. \nThat’s true in all sports over the course of a long season. And yet in college basketball, a sport that fancies itself as inclusive, the system only works one way for schools outside the power structure. Those types of schools, like Wichita State, are allowed to spend January and February squandering good bodies of work created in November and December. But the selection committee’s guidelines make it difficult, bordering on impossible, for schools outside the power structure to improve bodies of work in January and February even if the smart computers recognize and reflect an increase in quality. \nSpeaking of, Wichita State is 12th in KenPom. \nThe Shockers are 15th in Sagarin. \nThat doesn’t necessarily mean they’d beat all other bubble teams. But what it does mean is that they’d be obvious favorites on a neutral court over all other bubble teams. And what it also means is that KenPom sees them as better than all but three Big 12 schools and three ACC schools, and better than all but two SEC schools — plus better than every Big Ten team except Purdue, every Big East team exept Villanova and every Pac-12 team period. \nAnd yet Wichita State, without the MVC’s automatic bid, would be left out of the NCAA Tournament with a 26-4 record featuring one top-50 RPI win and zero sub-50 losses, according to Palm, if the NCAA Tournament started today. Meantime, TCU, also according to Palm, would be in with a 17-11 record featuring two top-50 RPI wins and two sub-50 losses. \nWhy? \nPresumably because TCU has one more top-50 win, and two more top-100 wins, than Wichita State. But shouldn’t it matter that TCU has had more than twice as many opportunities than Wichita State to record top-100 wins based on league affiliation alone? \nI think it should. \nTCU’s Big 12 schedule has so far provided the Horned Frogs with 10 chances to record top-100 wins. They’re 2-8 in those games. Meantime, Wichita State’s MVC schedule has provided the Shockers with two chances to record top-100 wins. They’re 1-1. So if you think TCU is better, or even more deserving, than Wichita State, what you’re saying is that you think TCU would be better than Wichita State, or at least as good as Wichita State, against Wichita State’s league schedule. And what you’re also saying is that Wichita State wouldn’t be as good as TCU, or better than TCU, against TCU’s league schedule. \nDoes anybody really believe those things? \nIn fairness, I do think TCU -- which I like and would love to see in the NCAA Tournament, but that’s not the point of this column -- would probably be 15-1 against Wichita State’s league schedule with a home win over Illinois State and a road loss to Illinois State -- just like the Shockers. But I’d bet everything I own, and some things I don’t, that the Shockers would be better than 2-8 in games against Big 12 schools with top-50 RPIs if allowed to play TCU’s league schedule to date, and every reputable computer agrees. And if you also agree but still insist TCU is more deserving of an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament than Wichita State, then your argument is rooted in a slanted approach that makes league affiliation based on the quality of schools’ football programs and television markets the most important factor when it comes to securing postseason basketball opportunities. \nThat’s lousy and unfair. \nBottom line, Wichita State has invested tens of millions of dollars in its basketball program, hired and kept a possible future Hall of Fame coach, given him all of the resources necessary to recruit and win at a unique level, and he’s absolutely crushing it -- proof being five straight NCAA Tournament appearances that include a trip to the 2013 Final Four. That the rest of the MVC (outside of Illinois State) stinks this season and in turn provides almost no opportunities to record top-100 wins that look nice on a computer screen in a hotel conference room in Indianapolis shouldn’t be the thing that determines Wichita State’s NCAA Tournament fate. \nThat’s what I think. \nEither way, in a perfect world, the Shockers will win the MVC Tournament and render this entire debate moot. But if the world were perfect, or at least fair, such wouldn’t even be required.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:29:34.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
