The state has paid a high economic price since that law passed in March 2016, as the NBA withdrew the 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte and the NCAA withdrew several championship events, including first- and second-round NCAA basketball tournament games, with more sanctions looming if the law isn't repealed. \nA spokesman for Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told TexasTribune.org that the law would not apply to professional sports stadiums, which would be free to set their own policy for bathroom use. \n\"Despite persistent misinformation in the media, under Senate Bill 6, all Texas teams will be able to set their own policies at the stadiums and arenas where they play and hold their events,\" Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia said. \nHowever, the legislation would apply to most college athletic facilities. Given the NCAA has already set a precedent by withdrawing events from North Carolina, Texas could expect the same treatment.
