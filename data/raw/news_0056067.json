PHOTO | COURTESY By HILARY KIMUYU, @hilarykimuyu \nThe alumnus of the prestigious Starehe Boys Centre have come to the rescue of John Kariuki, an A student, and old boy of the school who has been roaming the streets in search of a job. \nKariuki not only has a new home now after his former classmates took him to Eden House Foundation but has also received a complete make over. \nKariuki, a Bio-technology graduate from the Kenyatta University, who looked unkempt when he appeared on NTV, is now unrecognizable just a day after his story broke. \n“My life can now progress from point A to point B and it also feels good to have friends who can care for you,” Karuiku said. \nKen Ogutu, one of Starehe Alumnus who came to Kariuki’s rescue, said their former classmate needs more than money or a job at the moment because he has lived in the streets several months, hence the reason they took him to Eden House Foundation to for counselling before he can be ready to join the society. \nEMPLOYMENT \n“Streets does things to you which you cannot just wash off immediately, you cannot just get in a bathroom and come out a normal person,” said Mr Ogutu. \nAccording to the acting Director Starehe Boys Centre, Charles Masheti, when he heard of Kariuki’s suffering he contacted his class group who mobilized each other and went looking for him at Uhuru Park which has for long been his home. \nMr Kariuki was orphaned at a young age but he got a scholarship for his secondary school education at Starehe Boys Centre from where he attained a mean grade of A minus. \nHe later joined Kenyatta University with the assistance of HELB loans and graduated in 2013. But since then he has been trying to get a job but with no luck. \nMr Kariuki can now looks forward to being employed and promises that once he has settled down he will do his best to find employment to the many job seekers who might be going through a similar experience.
