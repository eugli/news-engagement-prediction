Basal cell carcinoma is the most frequently occurring form of cancer , according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. It is usually treatable, though, if not treated promptly, the SCF warns “it can be disfiguring.” \n“Thanks to frequent body checks and amazing doctors, all is well. Looks worse with the dressing on than off. I swear! #wearsunscreen ,” the “Logan” star captioned the photo. A post shared by Hugh Jackman (@thehughjackman) on Feb 13, 2017 at 12:42pm PST \nJackman has undergone treatment at least three times since revealing his skin cancer diagnosis in 2013 . The actor has been extremely open about the cancer, often sharing photos on social media and urging his followers to wear sunscreen . \nIn 2015, Jackman opened up about his diagnosis to People magazine, saying, “It’s always a bit of a shock just hearing the word ‘cancer.’ Being an Australian it’s a very common thing. I never wore sunscreen growing up so I was a prime candidate for it.” \n“I go every three months for check-ups,” he added. “It’s the new normal for me. My doctor says I’ll likely have more, and if that’s your cross to bear in life, you should be so lucky.” Also on HuffPost", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T17:46:15.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
