Subsequently, the story was picked up globally, and continues, globally, to overwhelm my appearance at the Oscars, on the occasion of my record-breaking 20th nomination, and to eclipse this honour in the eyes of the media, my colleagues and the audience.\n“I do not take this lightly, and Mr. Lagerfeld’s generic ‘statement’ of regret for this ‘controversy’ was not an apology. He lied, they printed the lie, and I am still waiting.”\nMeryl Streep has been nominated a record 20 times Credit: Getty L agerfeld’s statement said: “Chanel engaged in conversations with Ms. Streep’s stylist, on her request, to design a dress for her to wear to the Academy Awards.\n“After an informal conversation, I misunderstood that Ms. Streep may have chosen another designer due to remuneration, which Ms. Streep’s team has confirmed is not the case. I regret this controversy and wish Ms. Streep well with her 20th Academy Award nomination.”\nThe Deer Hunter actress is nominated for best actress for Florence Foster Jenkins, the inspiring true story of the New York heiress who pursued her dream of becoming a great singer despite her hilariously awful voice .\nAcademy Awards 2017 in Pictures: Hollywood prepares for the Oscars", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:06:34.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
