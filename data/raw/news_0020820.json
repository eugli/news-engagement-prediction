Bernhard Langer: Trump apologized to me over voter fraud story Read more \nHer attorney, Clark Birdsall, said on Friday that Ortega was a permanent resident who was brought to the US as a baby and mistakenly thought she was eligible to vote. He said she voted Republican, including for the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, whose office helped prosecute her. \nHer sentence was tough: voter fraud convictions, which are rare, often result in probation. As a convicted felon, Ortega is likely to be deported after serving her sentence. \nTarrant County prosecutors said jurors made clear they valued voting rights, but Birdsall said he believed Ortega would have fared better in a county with fewer “pro-Trump” attitudes. \nTrump carried north Texas’s Tarrant County with 52% of the vote in November. Birdsall said he wanted to steer the jury of 10 women and two men from any lingering thoughts about Trump’s unproven claims that 3 million people illegally voted in 2016 – but the judge wouldn’t allow him. \n“It was the 800lb gorilla sitting in the jury box,” Birdsall said. “I would have said, ‘You cannot hold this woman accountable for Donald Trump’s fictitious 3 million votes.’” \nBirdsall said the Texas attorney general’s office had agreed to leniency in exchange for Ortega testifying to lawmakers about illegal voting, but said the Tarrant County district attorney, Sharon Wilson, quashed those talks. \nA spokeswoman for Wilson acknowledged plea negotiations but would not divulge details. A spokesman for the attorney general did not respond to an email seeking comment. \nBirdsall said Ortega has lived in the US since she was a baby and has four teenage children. He said Ortega had learning disabilities and only a sixth-grade education. \nSam Jordan, a spokeswoman for Wilson, said the decision to prosecute had “absolutely nothing” to do with immigration. \n“This is a voter rights case,” she said. “Does [Wilson] consider voter rights important? Yes she does. And she thought it was important enough to go forward to a jury and let the jury of citizens decide, and they decided pretty clearly how important they think voting rights are.” \nTexas is one of many Republican-led states that have pushed for tighter requirements on voters to show identification at the polls. Supporters say such measures are necessary to combat voter fraud and increase public confidence in elections. \nResearch, however, has shown that in-person fraud at the polls is extremely rare, and critics of these restrictions warn that they will hurt mostly poor people, minorities and students – all of whom tend to vote Democratic – as well as the elderly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T17:34:00.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
