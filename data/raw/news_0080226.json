Do you know how I know? Because he constantly says the phrase ‘believe me.’ Nobody says ‘believe me’ unless they are lying,” Stewart explained. \n“I’ll give you some examples,” he continued. “Oh, honey, I was just helping Stacey test out her perfect sleep number. Believe me,” Stewart joked. \n“What? No. It’s just a giant wooden horse. Believe me. What? Democrats are in disarray? No. They have a plan. Believe me,” Stewart said. \nAfter taking a swipe at the Democrats, Stewart then focused his attention on the media, which had a setback this week when the president backed out of the White House Correspondents Dinner. \n“So, I heard Donald Trump broke up with you. Stings a little, doesn’t it? Finally thought you had met your match: a blabbermouth who is as thin-skinned and narcissistic as you are. Well, now it’s over and good riddance I say,” Stewart said. “Kick him to the curb.” \n“Here’s my point,” he continued. “This break up with Donald Trump has given you, the media, an amazing opportunity for self-reflection and improvement. Instead of worrying about whether Trump is unAmerican or if he thinks you are the enemy, or if he is being mean to you or if he is going to let you go back into the briefings, do something for yourself. Self-improvement, take up a hobby. I recommend journalism.” Taylor Link is a news writer at Salon.
