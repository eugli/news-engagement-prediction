RUDY SANTOS \nMANILA, Philippines - The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) expects the P1.9-billion pedestrian bridge called RunWay Manila, which will connect the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 3 (T3) to Newport City, to open by April this year. \n“Due to open in April 2017, RunWay Manila, the country’s first pedestrian bridge with walkalators, will allow the average person to walk the distance between the airport and Newport City in less than 10 minutes,” Public Works Secretary Mark Villar said. \nEarlier, Villar said the target is to complete the construction and open RunWay Manila for public use within the first-half of this year “and the latest by second quarter.” \nConstruction for the 220-meter pedestrian bridge link, which stands above Andrews Ave. in Pasay City, is being funded by Travellers International Hotel Group Inc. \nThe project is being undertaken as part of Travellers International’s commitment to help promote tourism by enabling visitors to have a hassle-free and seamless travel experience. \nThe enclosed and air-conditioned elevated bridge has moving walkways and elevators available for use free of charge 24/7.

We expect the iconic bridge to further ease the traffic congestion in the airport. The bridge is for the benefit and free use of the public, particularly tourists, who may want secure and convenient alternatives to reach various parts of the metropolis,” he said. – With Rudy Santos Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:45:09.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
