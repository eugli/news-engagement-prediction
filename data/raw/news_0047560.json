Article continues below \nNevertheless, Manchester City's Guardiola has weighed in with a surprising choice, to say the least. \nThe Spaniard, who has earned rave reviews for the way he gets his sides to play and the success he has enjoyed with Barcelona and Bayern Munich in the past, believes the best coach in the world isn't in the Premier League.

Whenever I speak with him I always feel like he wants to help me.\" \nIt wasn't that long ago that the former manager of Argentina, Chile Athletic Bilbao and Marseille was linked with the job at Swansea. \nHowever, it was confirmed on Monday that Bielsa will replace Lille's interim boss Franck Passi at the end of the season. \nAnd although Bielsa's managerial career has not been as trophy-laden as Guardiola's, the Man City coach thinks he deserves far more credit for his achievements. \nHe added: \"It is important for me to say this about Marcelo because it doesn't matter how many titles he had in his career. \n\"We are judged by that â€“ how much success we have, how many titles we have won. \n\"But that is much less influential than how he has influenced football and his football players. \n\"That is why, for me, he is the best coach in the world. I am looking forward to seeing him in Lille next season.\" \nLille will be Bielsa's first job back in football since his ridiculous two-day reign at Lazio last summer. \nAfter quitting 48 hours into the role, the Argentine later revealed that he decided to walk away from the Serie A side following the board's failure to sign a single new player before the start of pre-season. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
