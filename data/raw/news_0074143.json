Donald Trump wants more nuclear weapons so US is 'top of the pack' \nMiyan then killed the boy and cut his limbs and neck into several pieces, before ripping his stomach out and tearing off his flesh. \nPolice officers who later attended the disturbing scene said they found ‘the body… lying on the floor with the decapitated head beside it’. \n‘The skin on the abdomen was missing, and internal body parts and bloodstains were scattered across the room,’ one officer told the Hindustan Times . Police found a gruesome scene (Picture: Mydrim Jones) \nMiyan was found sitting near the body, he added, and gave himself up to police without any resistance. \nBut after his arrest, hundreds of people gathered outside the police station in Amariya, in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. \nAs they tried to attack Miyan, they demanded that he be killed for his alleged crime. \nWhen Miyan was later questioned by investigators, his responses were apparently unintelligible. \nHe has now been charged with murder and abduction.
