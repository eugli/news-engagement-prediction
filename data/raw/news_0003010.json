Even if they never say, they will treat us very differently from our wealthier relatives. \nAnd that's why every year I want to skip CNY because it is very financially draining on me and my parents and because since I am the only child, more Hong Baos are given rather than taken. \nHowever, my parents are very traditional and 爱面子, so they will usually get into a lot of debts for CNY, then there will be a lot of quarrels over money subsequently after CNY. And the prices of everything increasing during this period is not helping as well. \nThat's why I hope my friends can be more understanding and see why I am always very negative about CNY while you guys are so hyped about it. I really don't mean to insult my own culture. I just don't see a reason why traditions must be kept if it makes my family so miserable, just because the culture mandates everybody to do it. I am really sorry Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
