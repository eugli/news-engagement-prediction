The SD an HD version are not properly combined. Making it very difficult to manage. For now I would avoid purchasing the movie until this is fixed. HD File Messed Up - Just Like Fantasia Special Edition by SoundForSound As others have said the HD file does not show up correctly in iTunes or AppleTV and is not coalesced in the iTunes library. Fantasia Special Edition has the same issue and has been incorrect for months. iTunes support has been of no help. I wish they would correct these files and auto requeue them to download. Primeval Season 1 Episode 2 has also had popping audio for months starting around 22 mins 50 secs in with no replacement file on the iTunes servers. ... by youalreadyknow. Disney did a fantanstic job taking Carols work from the pages of a book and transforming them into something amazing, this movie follows the book very well. Personally, i could watch this movie over and over again and never get sick of it.
