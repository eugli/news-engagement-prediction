Except that it'll happen after Jurassic World , and is 99% likely to involve dinosaurs making the lives of their human counterparts a living hell. That's pretty much all you need for a Jurassic film, but even we dinosaur enthusiasts have to wonder what the story proper will hold for the J.A. Bayona directed sequel to 2015's runaway box office hit. Lucky for us, there's some very enticing information that's hit the internet, though it does sound a bit familiar. \nMy Entertainment World has a listing for Jurassic World 2 that apparently lists the film as shooting not only in its usual location of Hawaii, but also with some time to be spent in two UK locations. Also noteworthy is the supposed working title for the film, \"Ancient Futures,\" which ties into the possible plot that is summed up in the sparse and unconfirmed statement below. Take this with a grain of salt: \nThe adventures at the Jurassic World resort and theme park continue as the government has trained dinosaurs to carry weapons and use them for battle purposes. \nWhile we can't stress enough that this Jurassic World 2 synopsis is to be taken with all of the salt that you've got in the kitchen, it doesn't sound too far off from what we'd heard was going to be the next phase in the series' plotline. Dinosaur breeding technology, its acquisition and usage, are themes that the first film have readily set up within its very own events. Not to mention, Vincent D'Onofrio's Hoskins and B.D. Wong's Dr. Wu basically made it possible for InGen to allow the potential militarization of dinosaurs like Blue the Velociraptor, so the weapons mentioned above might be valid as well. Putting these pieces together, as well as looking at one of the U.K. locations the film is planning to shoot in, we think we might have an idea on where things are heading. \nWith the gorgeous and rustic look of supposed filming location Brecon Beacons of Wales, the story of Jurassic World 2's dino hijinks could involve returning to the probably dormant theme park. With a slightly rundown look to be expected, those that would use the dinosaurs in battle probably want to capture the surviving specimens from the park's initial operations. Of course, the forces of conservation / heroism would be standing up to the would-be trappers, as they travel closer to the inside of the island's heart of darkness. Again, this is all smoke and mirrors, but considering how valid the synopsis above seems at this moment, our guess is as good as yours. \nFor now, the concrete information we have includes the fact that Jurassic World 2 , or Jurassic World: Ancient Futures , if they want to get cheeky about it, hits theaters on June 22, 2018. If we unearth any more details about the next journey to John Hammond's land of dreams and nightmares, we'll have them for you as soon as they're found.
