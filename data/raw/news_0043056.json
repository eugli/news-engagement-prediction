Yet he is the de-facto 45th President of the United States,\" organizers wrote in a statement.\nBannon's reported influence in the White House has raised eyebrows, especially after Trump signed an executive order giving Bannon a seat on the National Security Council's Principals Committee. A Time magazine cover dubbed Bannon \"the great manipulator.\"\nAfter a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit portrayed Trump as being controlled by Bannon, Trump tweeted that he calls his \"own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it.\"\nThe group behind the signs says it hopes to spark some kind of response from Trump.\n\"Maybe we'll encourage an angry tweet or two. Maybe even get Trump to say his two favorite words to Bannon, 'You're Fired.' We'll tune in. It'll be great for ratings,\" the group said.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thegarance/status/833316845520355328", "http://www.thehill.com/", "https://t.co/pwTubJVFmu"], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:32:53.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
