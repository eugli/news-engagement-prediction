And he responded furiously when BBC Breakfast presenter Charlie Stayt asked whether he had told his inner circle a date when he will stand down as Labour leader. Jeremy Corbyn, left, promoted Rebecca Long-Bailey, right, to shadow business secretary to replace Clive Lewis, who resigned to vote against the Government's bill to trigger Britain's EU divorce Jeremy Corbyn accused the BBC of peddling 'fake news' in a bad-tempered interview today Echoing Donald Trump's complaint about the US media, he snapped: 'I am really surprised the BBC is reporting fake news.' Mr Lewis quit to join 51 of his MP colleagues last night in opposing the legislation triggering Article 50 at its crucial third reading. But the mutiny was only symbolic, as Theresa May pushed the law through the Commons with a huge majority after crushing efforts to amend it. WHAT HAPPENS NOW WITH THE HISTORIC BREXIT BILL? Having cleared all its Commons stages, the EU (Notification) Bill now moves to the House of Lords - where resistance from Europhiles is expected to be even stronger. The scrutiny in the Upper Chamber will begin on February 20, with two weeks of wrangling Any amendments that make it through the Lords are likely to be overturned by the Commons and sent back - in a process known as 'ping pong'. The government is hoping the law will be in place by March 7. That would set the stage for a frantic few days, with the Chancellor to laying the groundwork for a post-Brexit economy in the Budget on March 8. Then on March 9 Theresa May could travel to Brussels to formally invoke Article 50 at an EU summit. The action now moves to the House of Lords, where overwhelmingly pro-EU peers are expected to mount an even fiercer resistance. A senior government source fired the first shot in what promises to be a bitter battle last night by warning that the Upper Chamber could face 'abolition' if it obstructs the crucial legislation. However, Downing Street tried to walk the threat back this morning, making clear that it merely wanted the Lords to act 'patriotically'. There was a crumb of comfort for Mr Corbyn as he was spared the ignominy of sacking close ally Diane Abbott. The shadow home secretary managed to turn up to the Commons and follow the party line - having missed the second reading last week complaining of a 'migraine'. In a bizarre incident in a Commons bar after the vote, Mrs Abbott was said to have told Brexit Secretary David Davis to 'f*** off' when he tried to give her a kiss. In a statement announcing his departure, Mr Lewis said he had promised to represent the views of his constituents. 'I therefore cannot, in all good conscience, vote for something I believe will ultimately harm the city I have the honour to represent, love and call home,' he said. 'It is therefore with a heavy heart that I have decided to resign from the shadow cabinet.' Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis resigned rather than vote for the Brexit Bill at third reading last night, after pledging he would 'do what's right by my constituents' Mr Corbyn he responded furiously today when BBC Breakfast presenter Charlie Stayt asked whether he had told his inner circle a date when he will stand down as Labour leader Diane Abbott (pictured in the Commons last week) failed to vote in the second reading debate despite a three-line whip. But she did back the Bill last night MPs held a marathon series of votes in the Commons last night causing turmoil for Labour Earlier, shadow ministers Rupa Huq, Lyn Brown, Daniel Zeichner, Andy Slaughter and Cat West all supported a Liberal Democrat amendment that could have forced a fresh referendum on whatever deal Theresa May negotiates. The idea was crushed by a huge margin of 340 to 33 in the Commons tonight, before MPs gave the Bill its third reading by 494 to 122 - a majority of 372. Some 52 Labour MPs voted against letting the legislation clear the lower House, while 163 supported it. But aides to the Labour leader have refused to confirm that 14 shadow ministers who refused to obey the three-line whip will lose their jobs. A senior source said only that dissent would 'be dealt with after the vote'. In his interview this morning, M Corbyn said: 'It's not a disaster.' Challenged about rumours in Westminster that he had set a date for stepping down as party leader, he dismissed them as 'I made it up yesterday dot com'. 'Absolute nonsense,' he said. Pressed about claims that he will reconsider his position in a year if his poll ratings had not improved, Mr Corbyn replied: 'We are demanding social justice in Britain. 'That's what the Labour Party exists for, that's what I'm leading the party for and that's what I'm going to continue doing.' But told that Labour had agreed with everything the PM wants to do, a clearly irritated Mr Corbyn replied: 'No, we haven't agreed with everything. Do you not understand that this was a one-clause Bill?' Jeremy Corbyn (pictured at his home yesterday) suffered another huge rebellion over the historic Brexit Bill THE RUNNERS AND RIDERS TO TAKE OVER IF CORBYN DOES GO Norwich MP Clive Lewis A formerly staunch Corbyn supporter, he fell out with the leadership over the party's stance on Trident. As shadow defence secretary Mr Lewis was said to have punched a wall after a conference speech playing down the idea of unilateral disarmament was altered as he walked on stage. Mr Lewis will have burnished his credentials with the largely pro-EU grassroots by resigning to vote against the Brexit Bill last night. But he has been an MP for less than two years, has a fairly marginal constituency in Norwich South, and some MPs fear he is too volatile for the top job. Rebecca Long-Bailey The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury is being lined up by allies of shadow chancellor John McDonnell as their preferred option if Mr Corbyn either decides to walk away or is forced out. Mr McDonnell, who is so unpopular with colleagues that he probably would not get enough nominations to run himself, has described her as the 'next generation of our socialist leadership team'. But she is relatively unknown and may be seen as having too little experience if it does come to a contest in the near future. Angela Rayner The shadow education secretary has impressed with some strong performances in the Commons, and is often deployed to television studios by the leadership. She has an eye-catching back story, having left school at 16, become a teenage mother, and then built a successful career. She would be a plausible candidate for Labour's increasingly radical left-wing activists. She also has a solid union powerbase, having worked for Unison. Sir Keir Starmer The shadow Brexit secretary is a former director of public prosecutions and the intellectual heavyweight of Corbyn's shadow cabinet. He is forensic in the House, where he has been credited with forcing the government into concessions on the EU departure process despite Labour being in a hugely conflicted position. In a less polarised political atmosphere he could be the favourite, but the current anti-establishment mood and hard-left party membership is likely to mean he is the right man at the wrong time. Lisa Nandy A rising star of the soft left who has been in parliament since 2010, many thought the Wigan MP was being groomed by Team Corbyn for an eventual succession. But Ms Nandy became disillusioned with the shambolic leadership, and resigned along with swathes of other frontbenchers in a bid to force Mr Corbyn out. She then served as co-chair of the abortive challenge by Owen Smith. Since Mr Corbyn was reelected by another big margin she has refused to come back into the fold, and instead focused her energies campaigning on issues such as the government's troubled independent child sex abuse inquiry. THE LABOUR REBELLION: WHO'S IN AND WHO'S OUT? Five Labour MPs have so far quit Jeremy Corbyn's frontbench over the Brexit Bill, and more could follow today. DEFINITELY OUT: Rachel Maskell resigned as shadow environment secretary ahead of the vote on the second reading. Dawn Butler , shadow cabinet minister for diverse communities, had said she would back the Bill but then walked away to oppose it. Jo Stevens quit as shadow Wales Secretary, saying she 'cannot reconcile my overwhelming view' that leaving the EU is a 'terrible mistake'. Tulip Siddiq resigned from her junior shadow ministerial job in charge of Labour's early years policy. Clive Lewis , shadow business secretary, a close ally of Mr Corbyn, abstained last week but quit to vote against the Bill tonight saying he had to be true to his constituents. NOT OUT: Diane Abbott , controversially missed the second reading vote last week claiming she had a migraine. Critics pointed out that MPs receiving cancer treatment did come to vote. Managed to follow the three line whip tonight. Eleven shadow minister and three whips who voted against Brexit Mr Corbyn has yet to decide what will happen to the frontbenchers who voted against the Bill. They were Rosena Allin-Khan, Kevin Brennan, Lyn Brown, Ruth Cadbury, Rupa Huq, Chi Onwurah, Stephen Pound, Andy Slaughter, Catherine West, Alan Whitehead, Daniel Zeichner, Thangam Debbonaire, Vicky Foxcroft and Jeff Smith.
