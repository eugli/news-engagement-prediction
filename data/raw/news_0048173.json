The controversy recently gained a lot of attention after Cube announced they would be reconfiguring the group upon the original members’ departure . \n“I have nothing to say about the name issue,” Yoon Doo Joon answered. “Not only do we not know anything yet, but it’s too sensitive to discuss at a press conference.” \nHe added, “It hasn’t been a long time since we switched agencies, but I’m thankful that we’ve been cast in a lot of things. I like eating, so I wanted to appear on a program through which I can show a positive side of myself. I hope they cast me because I’m good at eating. I want to make the viewers happy.” \nYang Se Hyung, Nam Sang Mi, Lee Gyu Han, and Yoon Doo Joon will be hosting the third season of “Mr Baek The Homemade Food Master,” where the well-known celebrity chef and business owner Baek Jong Won teaches audiences how to make daily recipes with seasonal ingredients. It is currently airing every Tuesday from 9:40 p.m. KST. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:24:08.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
