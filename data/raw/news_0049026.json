Picture: Facebook/Lisa Williams Military wife greets fallen soldier’s body in heartbreaking airport scene news.com.au February 20, 2017 12:27pm \nA PLANE passenger has captured the heartbreaking moment a military wife mourned her fallen Green Beret husband as his body arrived home in the United States. \nLisa Williams was on a flight that arrived at a North Carolina airport last week carrying the body of US soldier Shawn Thomas, who died in a non-combat vehicle crash on February 2. \nMs Williams said when the plane touched down at Raleigh-Durham International Airport, passengers were asked to stay in their seats so someone could be let off the aircraft first, US broadcaster WPVI reported. \nSoldiers unloaded the coffin of Officer Shawn Thomas from the plane’s cargo area. Then the fallen soldier’s wife, TJ Thomas, stepped off the plane to grieve at coffin, which was draped with the US flag. \nMs Williams filmed the heart-rendering scene and uploaded the now-viral video to Facebook . \n“It was an honor to fly home with this PATRIOT! God bless his wife and family. There was not a dry eye around me,” Lisa Williams wrote in her post. She said the plane remained silent as passengers started to cry. \nSeven Green Beret soldiers later loaded the coffin into a black hearse and paid their respects, while the pilot thanked passengers for waiting, Fox News reported. \nMs Williams’ video has been viewed more than nine million times. She said Thomas’ widow has reached out to thank her for capturing the special moment. \nThomas, 35, had been in Niger to train local troops and residents to fight terrorism. \nHe had a decorated career in the US military, having been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan seven times and earning two Bronze stars, four Good Conduct Medals. He was posthumously awarded the Meritorious Service Medal and Army Commendation Medal for his work in central Africa, the Army Times reported. \nThomas was buried Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. He leaves behind his wife and four children. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:51:38.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
