The house witnessed utterly chaotic scenes including protest, gharao and some MLAs being manhandled. \nANI \nAmid all the chaos and confusion Edappadi K Palaniswami, the nominee of now jailed AIADMK general secretary Sasikala managed to win the trust vote in the assembly. \nBCCL \nThis, after the speaker, evicted all DMK MLAs for creating a ruckus in the house earlier in the day. The Congress and IUML had also walked out of the vote, leaving just AIADMK MLAs for the vote. \nOf these, 122 voted for Palaniswami while 11 MLAs from the Panneerselvam camp voted against. The number needed for a simple majority in the 234 member house was 116. \nThe trust vote means Palaniswami, a proxy of Sasikala is safe for at least six months from now, under normal circumstances. \nReacting to the trust vote, Panneerselvam said the vote was undemocratic. He also hit out at the Sasikala camp saying that now the state will be ruled by someone Jayalalithaa had said she won't have in the party in her lifetime. \nBCCL \nEarlier, in the day the assembly witnessed unprecedented scenes after the OPS camp, Congress and the DMK demanded a secret vote, to which the speaker said no. \nAlthough the media was denied access to the proceedings in the Assembly, visuals of chaos were later telecast on television channels.
