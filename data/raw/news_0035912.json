Elliott in Detroit, in support of immigrants.

Elliott. At one point, some of the protesters blocked an intersection as police and federal law enforcement kept on eye on the protesters. A large banner in front read: \"Immigrant Solidarity.\" \n\"We want to stand in solidarity with immigrants,\" said Sergio Juarez of Detroit. \"It's important to be out here in support of our community. Everyone is afraid now, but we can't live our lives in fear.\" \nJuarez says that cities like Detroit need more people and that targeting undocumented immigrants will hurt efforts to revitalize the city. \n\"They're rebuilding the city,\" he said. \nRelated: DHS memo proposed using up to 100,000 Guard troops to round up immigrants \nThe rally drew a diverse mix of people and was organized by the Michigan Peoples Defense Network, which handed out flyers that said \"immigrants are being scapegoated and targeted.\" \nMany cars that drove by honked in support, but one man in a truck yelled out \"Trump!\" as he rolled down Jefferson Avenue. \nThe protest was held as tensions rise in some immigrant communities, who fear increased deportations and profiling by law enforcement under the administration of President Donald Trump. \nCarlos Gonzalez of Melvindale held a sign at the rally that read: \"Immigrants love America. That's why they're here.\" \nTrump has said he's targeting criminals in his plans to deport immigrants, but Gonzalez and others fear that many who are not criminals will be swept up in raids. \nProtesters carry banner reading \"Immigrant Solidarity\" as they cross Jefferson Ave. near Mt. Elliott St. near the Detroit office of ICE. Photo taken on Feb. 17, 2017.

He said he joined today's protest because \"my parents are immigrants and it would be an injustice to them if I didn't show up.\" \nMilica Filipovic, a Dearborn immigration attorney at the rally, said many of her clients are unsure about their futures. She held a sign that read: \"For every one you take down, I'l be here to life them up.\" \nOther signs at the protest read \"Resist ICE raids\" and \"Defend Immigrant Rights.\" This was the third rally held this week in Detroit against the Trump immigration plans. On Thursday, about 100 businesses shut down in Detroit, Pontiac, and Ypsilanti to support of \"Day Without Immigrants\" protests nationwide. \nKhaalid Walls, spokesman for the Michigan branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), could not be immediately reached Friday. Walls said Wednesday about reports of increased raids over the past week nationally: \"All enforcement activities are conducted with the same level of professionalism and respect that ICE officers exhibit every day. The focus of these targeted enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICEâ€™s Fugitive Operations Teams on a daily basis.\" \nContact Niraj Warikoo: nwarikoo@freepress.com or 313-223-4792.
