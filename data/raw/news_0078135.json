A social media user recently posted a slip from a purchase showing it was cheaper. \nThe station, whose prices are decided upon by the executive of the association, sells 93 octane petrol at R12.88 a litre, 95 octane at R13.12, and diesel at R12.66 a litre. \nAccording to pricing regulations published by the Department of Energy in December last year , 93 unleaded was set at R13.38 and 95 unleaded at R13.62. Leaded 93 is also set at R13.38 and leaded 95 at R13.52, in fuel pricing zone 9C, under which Roodepoort falls. \nThe department said a difference of 50c a litre was excessive. \n\"All service stations in the same fuel pricing zone must have the same petrol price. Without having all the details, a difference of 50 cents looks excessive,\" said Thandiwe Maimane, spokesman for the department. \n\"Charging a different petrol price ... within the same fuel pricing zone is illegal [and] no one can be exempted from charging the gazetted petrol price ... \" said Maimane. \nThe association's Zeblon Simelane said it was doing nothing wrong. \n\"The product belongs to us and we can decide on the prices.\" He said the association would make its own decisions about prices, in line with hikes recommended by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in his Budget last week.
