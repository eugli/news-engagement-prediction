Story continues below \n“It’s like Christmas,” the freshman told CBS , describing the feeling of receiving care packages from home. “[I live] six hours away so I can’t really go home and go to the grocery store, because I don’t have a car up here, so it’s a really good feeling.” \nBut that giddy feeling didn’t last very long: one box that his mother sent contained food and goodies. The other contained garbage. \nREAD MORE: Wisconsin college student off the hook for speeding for tie tying tips \nWhen he called to ask whether that was a mistake, Cox’s mother, Connie, told him, “No, that’s the trash you were supposed to take out” during a recent visit home. \n“I thought I could get away with it this one time, but obviously, I didn’t,” he said. \nCox says he laughed hysterically at the prank, then tweeted a photo of the package. \nCox has three sisters and says he has a special relationship with his mother. He says, “She knows what to say at the exact time she should say it.” \n— with files from Jenny Rodrigues © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:17:39.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
