(See below)\nVideo of the McMaster announcement\nHere’s video of Trump announcing the selection of H.R. McMaster. The setting is Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.\nThe weekend\nTrump spent the holiday weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, returning to Washington Monday night. It was his third weekend in a row at Mar-a-Lago. His activities included a quick jaunt to speak at a Saturday afternoon political rally in Melbourne, Fla.; a Saturday night fundraising ball for Boston’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; golf Sunday with pro Rory McIlroy and others; and stopping by a luncheon fundraiser Monday for people with special needs.\nOn Sunday, he had a full day of “meetings, calls and interviews for the new [national security adviser],” which he continued Monday, a spokesman said.\nMore headlines\nThousands of demonstrators turned out Monday across the country to challenge Trump in a Presidents Day protest dubbed Not My President’s Day.\nCarolyn Kaster/AP\nMar-a-Lago\nMar-a-Lago’s well-heeled members and guests, who include New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick and Boston Herald columnist Howie Carr, enjoy a level of access to the president rarely seen in US history, the New York Times reports .\nIs this any way to run a government?

Here’s one fact-check . And here’s another .\nOne of his biggest misstatements was his suggestion that there had been a terror attack in Sweden on Friday night. “Look at what’s happening last night in Sweden,” he said. In fact, it had been a quiet night and Swedes were left insulted and scratching their heads .\nTrump walked back the statement in two tweets. The first, posted on Sunday, explained that he had been referring to a story on Fox News about “immigrants & Sweden.” The second tweet, on Monday, suggested he had been talking about problems caused by immigrants in Sweden. Experts familiar with Swedish crime statistics, however, said there’s no proof of such problems.\nBashing the media\nTrump also drew flak after he posted a tweet Friday afternoon saying that the media was “the enemy of the American People!” Fox news anchor Chris Wallace said he had gone too far . Defense Secretary James Mattis said he didn’t view the media as the enemy. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Commitee. said the comment was “deeply concerning.”\nIn an NBC-TV “Meet the Press” interview , Republican Senator John McCain said, “We need a free press. We must have it. It’s vital. ... If you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and many times adversarial press.” (McCain also delivered a withering critique of Trump in a speech Friday night.)\nHere’s a “Meet the Press” clip:", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Trump", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxfRDfv9tM8", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fnation%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Ftrump-today-get-ready-for-month-two%2FLe8xgmV3x7K2hdnOZtU2xM%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Trump", "https://www.statnews.com/2017/02/19/dana-farber-trump-mar-a-lago/", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fnation%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Ftrump-today-get-ready-for-month-two%2FLe8xgmV3x7K2hdnOZtU2xM%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tTrump", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fnation%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Ftrump-today-get-ready-for-month-two%2FLe8xgmV3x7K2hdnOZtU2xM%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Trump", "http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/880252483608", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/world/europe/trump-pursues-his-attack-on-sweden-with-scant-evidence.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fnation%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Ftrump-today-get-ready-for-month-two%2FLe8xgmV3x7K2hdnOZtU2xM%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:20:47.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
