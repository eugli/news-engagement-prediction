What type of secularism is this,\" he said. \n\nOn the issue of exodus raised by him during his campaign in western UP, Adityanath said he takes up matters which are of interest to people. \n\n\"There are over two dozen areas, where it (exodus) is clearly visible. Population imbalance is a reality there and that cannot be ignored,\" he said. \n\nOn the issues mentioned in the BJP manifesto, including exodus and triple talaq, Adityanath said BJP used to highlight issues related to people and will continue to do so. \n\nOn the triple talaq issue, he said, \"It is necessary for protecting the interest of women for their empowerment. If any part of the body is weak, the body cannot remain strong.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:35:12.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
