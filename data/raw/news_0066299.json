The city of Minneola and the area around it is expected to be hit by growth. (Orlando Sentinel) Lauren Ritchie community into an entirely new shape.\nAfter it hits, making a late-night run to Donut King for the maple frosted ones will be a struggle. Roads will be clogged, schools crowded, grocery stores always busy. \nYet, both the county and the city continue to approve more houses. \nThis predicted explosion of growth hinges on a $29 million interchange with Florida’s Turnpike that is under construction now north of Blackstill Lake Road and is to open in June. \nPublic Works Director Jim Stivender, who has nearly 40 years in planning roads for Lake residents, said he sees the opening of the interchange as “jumpstarting the development already approved in the area.” \n“You’re talking about thousands of acres,” he said. \nThis will be great because cookie-cutter houses look so lovely sprawled across the hills of south Lake County, right? And because we need more development, don’t we? \nToday — this moment — about 15,167 homes have approval and could be built tomorrow in the area around the interchange if developers want. So much for moving to “the countryside of Orlando,” which is how Lake County once marketed itself. \nThat many homes means at least 39,000 new residents — a bigger cluster of people in a single spot even than the city of Clermont, Lake County’s largest. Another 680 homes are in the pipeline for approval by Minneola City Council members in the coming weeks. Throw in an extra 1,748 residents. \nThat will be great for schools! We can fill all those unsightly empty desks — and then some. \nHarry Fix, the school-district planner in charge of growth, said it’s more critical now than ever before for local elected officials to extract what’s needed in south Lake from developers. He cited the proposed subdivision called Villa City, the largest ever proposed in Lake, which will be in Groveland. \n“They talked about setting aside a school site in lieu of impact fees. What does that do? We have to have the money to build,” Fix said. \nFix, Stivender and other staffers charged with keeping up with growth are scrambling to make it all work in fast-growing south Lake. Minneola just ordered a new firetruck. It has paid off debt in anticipation of growth. It’s got a private firm ready to handle some building department needs. \nState Rep. Larry Metz, R-Yalaha, has a bill going through the Legislature asking for $10 million to four-lane Citrus Grove Road, the last of the network planned to handle traffic coming from and going to the interchange. \nCounty officials for some years have predicted that the interchange opening will bring 7,400 jobs and $1 billion in “economic impact.” Oh, it will have impact all right — the same kind a house-sized meteor would have landing in Times Square on New Year’s Eve. It will wipe out Minneola as residents now know it. \nResidential growth doesn’t benefit a community in the long run. Rather, it provides an unstable boost during building booms. When things go bust again — and they will — then Lake will be stuck in the same economic situation as 2008, ranging from massive debt to enduring life’s small inconveniences. \nWe’ll be paying millions for new schools and frantically building roads. We’ll be putting up with more people with a buggy full of groceries in the 10-item lane at the Publix. Forget about getting a reservation in a good restaurant on Saturday night. The building-trades jobs that came in with yet another boom will be gone, and people will leave their cookie-cutter houses behind, just as they did nearly a decade ago when the economic meltdown started. \nMinneola City Manager Mark Johnson said he hopes commercial growth, which makes money for a city, will kick into gear about the time 300 houses a year are being built. Most city officials wish the same. Any commercial helps to offset the cost of services for real humans inhabiting single-family homes. \n“We’re already seeing the subdivision plans that have been sitting for a decade or more come back to life,” Johnson said. \nIn 2011, Minneola issued 34 building permits for new homes; in 2016, it was 214. So far, the city is on track to issue roughly the same number — but the interchange at milepost 279 opens in June. That’s when all bets are off. \nLritchie@orlandosentinel.com.
