He had seen her come home drunk a number of times with her colleagues.\nOn the day of the murder as well, she had brought her colleagues home. After a while, they had all left, forgetting to lock the door. The accused, who had been sitting outside the house and keeping a close watch on her, went in after they left. He allegedly tried to rape her, but when she fought back, he strangulated her with her jeans and then raped her.\nHe later tried to burn her but failed there as well. In a bid to mislead the police and make it look like robbery was the motive, he took some of her jewellery and fled from the spot.\nThe late breakthrough \nInitially, the police were clueless, with parallel investigations by several teams, including the Mumbai Crime Branch, leading nowhere. Several of the victim's friends were picked up for questioning, and later, neighbours, with Dhara being one of them.\nThe breakthrough came nearly two months after the crime, when the police sought the help of the area's locals to identify the person being seen in the footage from the CCTV on the building premises that they had been scanning. The footage was also leaked on social media and given to TV channels on January 8. On seeing that, on January 10, the accused fled to Kolkata.\nAn officer said a team traced him to Kolkata and brought him back, after which he was produced in court and sent to police custody for four days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:51:19.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
