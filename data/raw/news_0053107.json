Her preliminary hearing is scheduled for May. \nRCMP in hazmat suits busted a West Kelowna fentanyl lab in March 2016. Lauren Pullen / Global News Story continues below \nMounties executed a search warrant at the West Kelowna’s Kandy and Krome Kustoms, an automobile restoration shop owned by McCulloch. They also executed a search warrant at McCulloch’s home. \nRCMP said they seized about eight kilograms of suspected fentanyl, hundreds of fake Oxycontin and Percocet pills, two industrial pill presses and $40,000 in the two locations. \n“Police estimate that this operation has potentially produced hundreds of thousands of pills, likely distributed locally and possibly beyond,” said Kelowna RCMP Sgt. Alex Lynch in a previous news release. \nAccording to parole board documents “it was suggested that (McCulloch) had been importing fentanyl from China and making Percocet and Oxycontin pills.” \n“Police seized an estimated $940,000 considered to be proceeds of crime.” \nMcCulloch, 37, is being released on bail with conditions, including that he has ‘no association with outlaw motorcycle organizations,’ and he remains under house arrest. He’s facing additional charges which will be dealt with in May. \n-With files from Kelly Hayes and Blaine Gaffney © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:47:31.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
