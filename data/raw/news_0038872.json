There is an expansive grey area about what really qualifies as being unfaithful to your partner. \nIn a broad sense, cheating comprises anything that goes against your partner’s expectations of you. \nThere is no accepted checklist of what counts as cheating. \nDifferent people have different definitions of what they may term as infidelity. Cheating doesn’t always require physical contact. \nThere are numerous non-sexual things that a person can do that ends up being total deal-breakers. \nIf you are wondering if you have crossed the line, I have compiled a list of some seemingly harmless things that count as inappropriate behaviour for someone in an exclusive relationship: \nSuggestive correspondence \nIn you were not sure, texting back and forth with an ex or someone with a romantic interest in you is not okay! \nALSO READ: Ten tips on how to talk to your child about sex \nCheating has become way too easy in this era of instant messaging and social media.

If that is what gets you going, come home to me! I’d be more than happy to give my man a strip show. \nDenying a relationship \nIf someone asks you if you are in a relationship and you say you are single, even though you are seeing someone, that is cheating. You may not be doing the deed, but you are definitely opening up opportunities to do just that. \nSecret rendezvous \nSo your better half is out of town or something and you decide to catch dinner with a colleague of the opposite sex. It is just dinner, right? Wrong! That is cheating. \nWhen it is all said and done, some of these things seem pretty harmless and not enough to fuss over, but whenever you start to justify yourself, flip the situation around and ask yourself how you would react if your partner was the one doing those things. \nThat is a sure way to put things into perspective! \nTell me what you think.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:12:30.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
