At the end of the day, that's kind of what we're moving toward. Playing in real games and things that matter.\" \nSeveral regulars ( Mookie Betts , Xander Bogaerts , Mitch Moreland and Pablo Sandoval ) played in Thursday's college exhibition against Northeastern. With an extra week of Spring Training, Farrell is waiting a couple of days to start playing his starters back-to-back. \nMoreland, a free-agent acquisition this winter, belted a homer against Northeastern on Thursday. Moreland's three-run home run NEU@BOS: Moreland crushes three-run homer Mitch Moreland hits his first spring homer with the Red Sox, a three-run shot that drives in Mookie Betts and Xander Bogaerts in the 3rd \n\"You don't really set expectations other than to get your work in and try to stay healthy through the spring and just be ready to go once the season starts,\" said Moreland. \nAny numeric goals? \n\"A World Series ring on my finger. That would be the ideal number,\" Moreland said. \nDustin Pedroia , Boston's longest-tenured player now that David Ortiz is retired, will make his debut on Saturday against the Twins. \nWhile Farrell is waiting another week to put his regular starting pitchers into games, Friday presents an opportunity for lefty Henry Owens to prove he can be a viable depth option after a tough 2016. \nOwens was considered one of Boston's best prospects a couple of years ago, but his stock has fallen due to lack of command. \n\"I think the one thing that Henry Owens did was follow a detailed plan for him to add weight, add strength, particularly core strength,\" said Farrell. \"He started his throwing program earlier in the calendar, all by design, and it's shown at least some initial improvements, at least in his body control, better energy in his delivery. \" has covered the Red Sox for MLB.com since 2002.
