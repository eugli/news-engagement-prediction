Rufus from the jewellery counter seems to have found his way to Sainsbury's ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW \nBy Eleanor Bley Griffiths Thursday 23 February 2017 at 12:34PM \nEmma Freud has been teasing us all day with cryptic photos as she and her team film scenes for the Red Nose Day special in Sainsbury's (of all places), but now we think we know what is going on: Rowan Atkinson is the mystery star on set! \nLook at the back of that head.
