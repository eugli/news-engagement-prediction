At least that’s what the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is projecting. In a shocking decision, the so-called ‘censor board’ rejected certification to Prakash Jha’s next – Lipstick Under My Burkha starring Konkana Sen Sharma coz it was lady oriented! Yes, we aren’t kidding. According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, the film was screened for the examination committee but the team decided not to certify it. In fact, the reasons stated in the letter will leave you stunned. The tabloid revealed the contents of the letter from the CBFC, which read as, “The story is lady oriented, their fantasy above life. There are contanious sexual scenes, abusive words, audio pornography and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society, hence film refused under guidelines 1(a), 2(vii), 2(ix), 2(x), 2(xi), 2(xii) and 3(i).” \nPrakash Jha is obviously angry with this decision as he revealed to the tabloid, “As a country, we must encourage freedom of expression but the CBFC refusing to certify films that tell uncomfortable stories discourages filmmakers from pushing the envelope. Films should challenge the status quo which is what Lipstick Under My Burkha perhaps does and I believe our audience deserve to watch it.” ALSO READ – Vikrant Massey to star in Konkona Sen Sharma’s directorial debut \nLipstick Under My Burkha stars Konkona Sen Sharma, Ratna Pathak Shah , Aahana Kumra and Plabita Borthakur. It tells us about the secret lives of these women as they search for a little more freedom. Directed by Alankrita, the film is being showcased at various film festivals before being released in India. Currently, the director is at the Glasgow Film Festival for the film’s premiere and she is hoping that everything is sorted out before she comes back. Talking about the whole controversy, she tells the tabloid, “It’s a feminist film with a strong female voice which challenges patriarchy. I think that’s why they don’t want to certify it. As a filmmaker, I stand by the story and will fight for it till the end.” \nThe team is now waiting for an official letter from the Revising Committee, after which they will apply to FCAT . As the director adds, “I am travelling to some more festivals and hopefully I will have a hearing by the time I return in March.” ALSO READ – Konkona Sen Sharma REACTS on why she announced her split from Ranvir Shorey on Twitter \nEarlier, the CBFC had objected to the premise of the Nawazuddin Siddiqui ‘s Haraamkhor which touched the love story of a student and a teacher. Prakash Jha’s Jai Gangaajal was also not given a certification after the examining committee failed to arrive at a consensus. However, both the films were released after FCAT passed it. So looks like Konkana’s latest film will have to take that route too…", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:48:35.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
