Could   \nA mum today revealed how continually dropping her cup at a Rihanna concert was the first sign she was having a stroke aged just 28. \nMichele McGarry first thought her clumsiness was to blame, but moments later she fell unconscious in front of her horrified 13-year-old sister, Caitriona. \nLuckily for Michele, who was watching the gig in Belfast, her friends noticed the signs and their quick-thinking actions undoubtedly saved her life. \nNow the chartered accountant has joined forces with the Stroke Association on its latest campaign to highlight the FAST test, which identifies the three most common symptoms of a stroke. \nSpeaking about her own experience back in 2011, Michele explained how what was meant to be a night of fun and laughter turned into a living nightmare.

I thought I was just being clumsy even though this happened quite a few times. \n\"I had had less than two drinks so I knew I couldn't be drunk. Luckily, I received instant medical attention. My friends alerted security who brought me to the medical room where an ambulance was called straight away. \n\"My friend suspected immediately that I had had a stroke but no one could, would or wanted to believe it. \n\"I remember in the ambulance the girl kept asking me to squeeze her hand as hard as I could. As far as I knew I was squeezing her hand and I was frustrated that she kept asking me. \n\"I didn't realise I had no power and I actually wasn't squeezing her hand. I heard my sister, who was only 13 at the time, on the phone ringing people and crying. I tried to tell her it was OK. \n\"It was only when I tried to speak that I realised I wasn't OK. I couldn't say her name properly and I couldn't recognise my own voice - my speech was badly slurred. My face was also drooped, although I didn't know this until much later.\" \nMichele was rushed to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast where a brain scan revealed a huge blood clot and doctors confirmed she was having a stroke. \nShe received a clot-busting treatment called thrombolysis. \n\"Initially I had complete left side paralysis but the clot busting drug saved my mobility; had I not been diagnosed and treated so quickly I would not have been able to receive the drug which has to be administered within a few hours,\" she said. \n\"I have nothing but high praise for the people who looked after me during this time.\" Read More Miracle baby saved after mum-to-be dies suddenly at eight months pregnant Michele (left) was at a Rihanna concert when she fell ill (Photo: Handout) \nMichele was told that the actions of her sister, friends, and the medical professionals helped her saved her life. \nShe said she feels lucky that she got medical attention so quickly as, on most other Friday nights, she would have been driving home from work in Dublin and the outcome could have been so different. \nFollowing her stroke, doctors discovered that Michele had atrial fibrillation (AF) – a type of irregular heartbeat that often goes undiagnosed. \nAF is a risk factor for stroke and was the cause of Michele’s stroke. Since then, Michele has also been diagnosed with a genetic heart condition – restrictive cardiomyopathy. \nMichele’s AF is proving very difficult to control and she has spent a lot of time in hospital recently and was forced to give up her job. \nThe long-term effects of Michele’s stroke include problems with mobility, breathlessness, extreme fatigue, lack of co-ordination, concentration and memory problems. \nDespite these health challenges, Michele passed her final chartered accountancy exams just one year after her stroke. \nShe is a member of the Stroke Association’s Young Women After Stroke group and is keen to raise awareness that stroke affects younger people. \n\"This group has offered me a lifeline and helped to give me a new purpose in life,\" said Michele. \n\"I have met other young women (whom I now regard as some of my closest friends) that have been through similar experiences to me. \n\"I look forward to our meetings, where we can share ideas, tips and questions. Since joining the group I have spoken at Stormont and appeared in a calendar. \n\"I would not even have had the confidence to do these things before my stroke, it is only with the support of the girls that I have been able to do so - this group empowers me and I feel blessed to be part of it.\" \nBrenda Maguire, campaigns manager at Stroke Association, said: \"Having a stroke is devastating. It can happen to anyone, of any age, at any time. Every second counts when you are having a stroke, so recognising the signs and calling 999 for an ambulance is crucial. \n\"A stroke is a medical emergency – as serious as a heart attack, so you need to seek immediate medical help. The quicker a person arrives at a specialist stroke unit, the quicker they will receive appropriate treatment to minimise the impact of their stroke. \n\"We want more people Northern Ireland to learn the FAST test and share it with their friends and family to help others to save lives, and improve the chance of a better recovery for those who experience stroke.\" \nTo find out more about the FAST campaign, and to view information and support available, visit www.stroke.org.uk/FAST What is the FAST test? \nFace: look at the person's face and ask them to smile. Has their face fallen on one side? \nArms: ask the person to raise both of their arms and keep them there. Are they unable to raise one arm? \nSpeech: ask the person to tell you their name or say 'hello'. Is their speech slurred? \nTime: if you spot any of these signs, always call 999.
