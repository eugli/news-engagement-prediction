recovered by a British officer from the Fuhrer’s bunker after his death - has sold for £161,000 at auction.\nThe Nazi leader travelled everywhere with the blood-red telephone and used it to issue orders that sent millions of people to their deaths.\nThe phone - described as “virtually unequalled in historical importance” - was taken from the bunker by Brigadier Sir Ralph Rayner.\nHe was the first Briton to arrive at Hitler’s Berlin hideaway after the feared dictator took his own life at the end of World War II .\nRalph was sent by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery to meet with his Russian counterparts following the German surrender in May 1945.\nRead More Woman who worked for Nazi propaganda chief Goebbels - the Holocaust architect - dies aged 106 Hitler's personal red telephone (Photo: Caters) Russian troops gifted him the phone - which Hitler travelled with for the last two years of World War II - after he toured the bunker.\nWhen Ralph was summoned back to the UK by intelligence chiefs a month later he smuggled the incredible memento inside his suitcase.\nHe refused to talk about his ‘trophy’ for decades because he feared he would be accused of looting - which was banned by military chiefs.\nThe Bakelite phone was then stored in a safe at his home in Dawlish, Devon, and rarely taken out by the war hero.\nMade by German electronics giant Siemens in 1943, it is chillingly engraved with a swastika and Hitler’s name.\nHitler took the phone everywhere with him (Photo: Caters) It even has scorch marks from a fire started by Hitler’s aides on his instruction after the Fuhrer and wife Eva Braun killed themselves.\nRalph, who went on to be a Tory MP, passed the phone on to his son Ranulf before his death in 1977 - and he has now decided to sell it.\nThe 82-year-old, who is also from Dawlish, said: “This was Hitler’s personal instrument of death.\n“It is a very sinister piece of equipment, when you think about what it was used for.\n“He would have used it extensively to scream brutal orders to those running the concentration camps and to his generals on the battlefield.\nThe vintage leather carrying case that was used to carry the phone (Photo: Caters) “One of the last calls Hitler made on it was to order that his new brother-in-law, General Hermann Fegelein, was to be shot for treason.\n“He then called his aides and told them to torch his apartments once he and his wife, Eva Braun, had committed suicide.\n“As soon as their lifeless bodies had been removed, the two men tried to do so. That’s why the phone has been lightly scorched.\n“The orders Hitler shouted down the phone’s mouthpiece, many of which are recorded in history, are a lesson we should never forget.”\nThe phone was sold to an unknown bidder at an auction of military items by Alexander Historical Auctions in Chesapeake City, Maryland.\nAdolf Hitler engraved on the phone (Photo: Caters) Auctioneer Bill Panagopulos said: “When Mr Rayner first called and described the phone and the story behind it, I almost fell off my chair.\n“It stopped me dead. This phone is as significant an item, in terms of historical importance, as I have ever come across relating to Hitler.\n“When you consider what this was used for, this is remarkable. It is arguably the most ‘destructive’ weapon of all time”\n“He would have used it to order that Stalingrad must be held at all costs, and to launch the deadly V1 and V2 rocket attacks on Britain.\n“This was Hitler’s mobile device of destruction, used in vehicles, trains, his field headquarters and in the last desperate days beneath Berlin.\nHitlers personal telephone sold at auction for £161,000 (Photo: Caters) Hitler’s bunker was an air-raid shelter and part of a subterranean complex constructed in two phases, finally being completed in 1944.\nHe took up residence there in January 1945 and it became the centre of the regime until the last week of World War II.\nThe Nazi leader married Braun in the bunker during the last week of April 1945, shortly before they committed suicide in his study.\nRalph’s son said his father refused the Russian offer of Braun’s personal phone - but could not turn down the chance to own Hitler’s.\nHe said: “He accepted, delighting the Russian by saying that his favourite colour was red.\n“I remember him returning from Germany with Hitler’s ‘hotline’ red telephone hidden in his suitcase.\n“Apart from proudly showing these two war trophies to his immediate family on his return, he didn’t mention them again for many years.”\nThe phone’s handset must be rotated almost 60 degrees before it can be removed from the cradle.\nThis was to prevent it from shaking loose during transport in a train or car.\nIn 1990 Ranulf tracked down Rochus Misch, who was Hitler’s switchboard operator in the Berlin bunker.\nHe sent him a photo of the phone - and he confirmed it was the one that accompanied the Fuhrer during 1943 and 1944.\n  Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily   Comments Show more comments More On Adolf Hitler World War 2 Nazis", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:33:13.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
