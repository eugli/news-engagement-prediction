I was also told to consider about the people above the poverty line. So, we have withdrawn all the conditions. Anyone living Delhi can go to the 53 hospitals or polyclinics to get the referral,” said Satyendar Jain, Delhi health minister, at the Annual Day Function of Forensic Science Laboratory. \nThe minister added that, “People have to pay at least Rs2,000 to Rs3,000 even at AIIMS to get these tests. But, we will do it for free.” \nThe minister also said that the proposal for another forensic lab in Delhi is in “advanced stage”. \nAt present, there is only one government facility for testing of forensic samples in Delhi.

And, the new samples are dealt with within a month or a month and a half. There have been cases where the reports have been submitted before the chargesheet is filed,” Jain said, who is also the home minister. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:43:03.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
