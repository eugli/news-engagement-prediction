The director, who was nominated for her film 13th , wore a dress by designer Mohammed Ashi from Saudi Arabia. Ashi launched Ashi Studio in Beruit, Lebanon, 10 years ago. DuVernay tweeted about her dress alongside a photo of the lacy gray gown on the red carpet. “A small sign of solidarity,” she wrote. “I chose to wear a gown by a designer from a majority Muslim country. Thanks to @AshiStudio of Lebanon.” DuVernay’s sartorial choice follows President Trump’s immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries. Her dress was only the beginning of anti-Trump statements at tonight’s awards. Iranian film director Asghar Farhadi , who won the award for best foreign film, did not attend the awards in solidarity with those affected by the ban. In January, DuVernay tweeted about the immigration ban, and specifically, how Farhadi would be affected by it. “Amplifying words of one of my favorite filmmakers, Asghar Farhadi, who like too many others will be turned away from the Land of the Free,” she wrote above a quote from Farhardi’s 2012 Oscar acceptance speech for his film A Separation .

CHARLIZE THERON IN DIOR \nTheron’s hair is similar to Scarlett Johansson’s (and their dresses have a kind of similar cut) and if we don’t get a picture of the two of them together by the end of the night, we will be very disappointed.
