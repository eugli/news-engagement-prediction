It's up to you,\" he said. \n\"And really [it's] up to the AFL to make a decision on this and we'll abide by the decision.\" \nLast week Gold Coast chairman Cochrane said there was no written agreement about which jumpers the teams would wear, and dismissed Koch's ultimatum. \n\"The AFL — not Koch — has full responsibility for the league calendar,\" he told The Advertiser. \nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T11:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:54:16.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
