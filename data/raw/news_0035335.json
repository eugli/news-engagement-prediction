President Trump falsely accused one of the caucus' most prominent members of ditching a planned get-together because of political pressure. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) \n\"I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it's great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it's great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited. And then he said, well, I can't move, it might be bad for me politically. I can't have that meeting,\" Trump said. \nTrump's jaw-dropping lines from wild White House press conference \n\"I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy,\" Trump said. Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill Jan. 5. (Zach Gibson/AP) \n\"He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can't make a meeting with him. Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by (Senate Minority Leader Chuck) Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight,\" Trump added. \"He was probably told, 'don't meet with Trump. It's bad politics.\" \nMoments after Trump's press conference ended, the CBC main Twitter account tweeted out a letter dated Jan. 19, in which the group's chairman, Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), clearly invited Trump to meet. Trump came under fire for suggesting civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) isn’t a hero. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP) \n\"It is my sincere hope that you will accept this invitation to engage in an earnest effort to work together on these issues,\" the letter stated. \nTrump casually muses on ‘nuclear holocaust,’ yells at reporters \nHouse Oversight & Government Reform Committee ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) also strongly disputed Trump's claims that Cummings had canceled their meeting after Schumer told him to. \n\"I've never even had a conversation with Chuck Schumer about the President — ever, ever. So I don't even know what he's talking about,\" Cummings told reporters. \"I'm 66 years old and I make my own decisions.\" \n\"I have no idea why President Trump would make up a story about me like he did today,\" Cummings added in a statement. \"Of course, Senator Schumer never told me to skip a meeting with the President.\" Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:48:33.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
