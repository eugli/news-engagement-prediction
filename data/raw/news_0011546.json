That price, however, might not be enough to repel the interest of Real Madrid and Bayern Munich – two teams said to be monitoring his progression.

They did not specify a price but Bale’s fee was in the region of €100 million. Alli signed a new five-year-deal with the club and also received a boost in his pay for his emergence as one of the best young players in European football. \nThe same report, however, states that Tottenham do not want any of their star names to leave until they have played at least one year in their stadium, which they will move to for the start of the 2018-19 season. At the moment, Allie is on €69,000 per week and over €3 million a year as he contonues to grow in the Surs shirt; he has 13 goals this season in all competitions.
