But, if you have made it this far, let&apos;s just go ahead and present you with the details. The \"Valentine&apos;s Adult Meal\" comes with two Whoppers, two orders of French fries, two beers, and a \"romantic ADULT TOY.\" The offer will be made available after 6 p.m. on Valentine&apos;s Day for people over the age of 18 years old. As the above video suggests, the ADULT TOY is actually three things:  a satin mask, feather duster, and a scalp massager.  While we can assure you that this isn&apos;t some strange cross promotion with the film  Fifty Shades Darker , Burger King really dropped the ball gag on this one.  \nOnce you get an opportunity to give these adult toys a spin, nothing will get both of you in mood quite like using the scalp massager on one another. After all, who doesn&apos;t like having their hair faintly smell like burgers? Or, what about lightly running the feather duster over each other&apos;s face, and getting an overwhelming fried food aroma? Or, how about getting the satin mask pulled over your eyes, so your partner can make a quick getaway?  \nThanks, BK! \n \nTags: News , Videos , Burger King , Valentines Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:46:33.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
