They then repeatedly chanted “We [are] the people!” \nThe rap stars, accompanied by Anderson .Paak, also kicked over several symbolic bricks, referring to Mr. Trump ’s proposal for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:13:27.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
