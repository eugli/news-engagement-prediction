PUBLISHED: 08:56, Thu, Feb 23, 2017 | UPDATED: 09:36, Thu, Feb 23, 2017 GETTY Two liberal politicians have formed a pact to keep out Marine Le Pen \nEmmanuel Macron’s stuttering campaign was given a huge boost yesterday when his one-time rival Francois Bayrou shocked French politics by announcing he will not stand as a candidate so that he can concentrate on helping his fellow centrist get elected. \nPolls had indicated that Mr Bayrou, a three-time presidential hopeful, would have sucked left-wing support away from Mr Macron as a candidate, significantly weakening his chances in the first round of voting.

GETTY Francois Bayrou announced he will not run for president GETTY He will instead concentrate on boosting the chances of fellow centrist Emmanuel Macron \nThe 39-year-old former banker, who has never held public office, enraged many voters when he described his country’s former occupation of Algeria as a “crime against humanity”. \nAnd the latest opinion poll by Ifop shows Ms Le Pen has opened up a commanding eight point lead over him for the first round of voting, despite being embroiled in her own scandal about EU expenses. \nAnnouncing his decision not to run for president, 65-year-old Mr Bayrou said: \"We are in an extremely risky situation, and to tackle this exceptional situation, I think we need an exceptional response. \n\"I have decided to offer Emmanuel Macron an alliance. The danger is too big, we must change things.” This is a turning point in the campaign Emmanuel Macron \nDescribing the move as a “sacrifice” on his part, he added: “What's at stake with this alliance is to restore hope.” \nPolling shows that Ms Le Pen has significantly closed the gap to both her likely rivals for the second and final round of voting, but still remains a long way off being predicted to triumph over either of them. \nIf the run-off were held tomorrow she would secure 41 per cent of the vote against Mr Macron and 42 per against Mr Fillon, according to a weekly poll tracker. \nAnd Elabe pollster head Bernard Sananes said that although Mr Bayrou's decision not to run did not radically change the polling arithmetic, it gave the Macron's campaign a boost after it had lost some momentum recently.
