Thomas cut the pink and blue cake, to find the out they were having a baby girl! \nWe are so excited for them, and know she will be daddy's little girl. So many of Thomas's songs have been written about his wife, so we cannot wait to hear what he writes for his little girl. \nCongratulations guys! \nWe'll catch up with Thomas in a few weeks when we performs at the iHeartRadio Music Awards in Los Angeles.
