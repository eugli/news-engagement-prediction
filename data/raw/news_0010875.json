Jesus has made an outstanding impact at City \nGuardiola has seen a turnaround in City’s fortunes since unveiling his new-look attack of Jesus, Sane and Raheem Sterling - at an average age of 20. \nAnd Toure - who has also become a key figure after being frozen out of the first team earlier in the season - has endorsed the club’s transfer strategy. \n“We need to have young players because City are always a team who wants to win the league,” he said. “The mentality of the club is to try to get new players in and try to do as best as possible. \n“When you see De Bruyne, Silva, Jesus, Sane, and Raheem playing well, you realise we have a great squad with some young players.” \nCity were behind only West Brom, Stoke and Watford in terms of the average age of their squad at the start of the campaign. Read More Pep Guardiola plans defensive overhaul \nIt’s notable that City had the oldest squad of any of the English clubs competing in the Champions League. \nWith Pablo Zabaleta (32), Bacary Sagna (33) and Gael Clichy (31) all out of the contract in the summer, the age of Guardiola’s squad is set to drop further. \nAnd despite targeting young defenders Hector Bellerin (21), Theo and Lucas Hernandez (19 and 20) and Aymeric Laporte (22) last summer, the City manager insists he couldn’t conduct a major overhaul in his first window at the club. \n“We realised that we have a lot of players over 30,” he said. “For example, full-backs are 31, 32. \n“But they are so important. We cannot change absolutely everything in one season. Toure has welcomed the arrival of young stars like Sane \n“I can understand, for example, how important Yaya, Kolarov or Gael are. Or the personality from Pablo - in the locker room or when he had the problem in his back and he played against Barcelona. \n“At the end, the heart and soul of the team are the old players, the people who know the club. \n“Sooner or later, of course, the process is going to change. \n“The manager changes - only the fans remain the same because you love the club. \n“I think the situation is starting, but it cannot be possible to do that with eight, nine players. \n“First, it is impossible because every player costs £45-50m. So it is impossible to do that and it is not good to change seven, eight, or nine players. \n“First it is not possible and also it is not good.” Read More Yaya Toure offered Man City contract hope by Pep Guardiola \nToure, meanwhile, is predicting a thrilling finish to the season - despite runaway leaders Chelsea threatening to turn the title race into a procession. \n“We are 10 points behind Chelsea - I think it’s tough,” he told City's website. “The Premier League is very, very tough and all we have to do is just focus on ourselves and keep going. \n“If we continue to win I think it’ll be a very, very exciting end to the season. \n“Now, with the quality of players we have, we just have to perform well. \n“That’s the most important thing, to keep winning because the Premier League is so demanding, so tough.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:05:49.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
