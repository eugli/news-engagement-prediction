During Sunday's Grammys , Corden took the gimmick to the next level by staging its largest karaoke yet with a supergroup singalong of Neil Diamond's \"Sweet Caroline.\" \nLed, of course, by Neil Diamond. Diamond and Cordon were joined by Jennifer Lopez , Tim McGraw, Keith Urban, John Legend , Jason Derulo, Faith Hill, and Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic for the entire song, with a special guest appearance by Blue Ivy Carter at the very end. It's almost as if Corden was trying to upstage Ellen DeGeneres ' legendary Oscar selfie from 2014. \nEllen wasn't able to land Beyonc√© 's daughter, so obviously Corden won.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:01:02.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
