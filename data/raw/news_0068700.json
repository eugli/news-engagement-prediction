The jogger was not licensed to carry a handgun. As the jogger was running home from his workout center in southwest Arlington, Texas, a driver of a pickup truck began circling. Eventually, a teenage suspect jumped out of the vehicle and pointed a gun at the man, demanding his possessions, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported .\nOne of those possessions, unbeknownst to the robber, was a handgun. The jogger quickly brandished his own weapon and fired multiple shots at the gunman–striking him at least one time in the leg.\nWFAA reported that officers found 10 to 12 shell casings in the parking lot where the shooting took place. A nearby business owner found a new hole in one of their windows.\nThe robbery suspect jumped back in the pickup truck, and the driver fled away, the area newspaper reported. Police later found the vehicle abandoned nearby. Its owner reported it stolen a few days earlier.\nPolice eventually apprehended the suspect after officers pulled over an SUV. Police officers found the wounded teen in the passenger seat. An ambulance transported the suspect to an area hospital where doctors treated him for non-life threatening injuries, Arlington Police Department Lt. Chris Cook told reporters.\n“Officers received information that the suspect then entered an SUV driven by an adult female,” WFAA reported from a police statement. “This SUV was stopped by officers at the intersection of Poly Webb Road and Little Road. The suspect was compliant and transported to the hospital for treatment.”\nOfficials do not know if the woman driving the SUV was involved in the robbery attempt.\nThe jogger was not licensed to carry a handgun. Police officials told the local ABC affiliate they do not expect charges to be filed on the jogger, but referred the case to the Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office for review.\nBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
