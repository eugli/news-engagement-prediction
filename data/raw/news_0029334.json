He said in 2006, 6,497 children were in out-of-home care nationally.\nStolen generation survivors still suffering, says Uncle Jack Charles Read more\n“Then there was the Little Children Are Sacred inquiry which increased the focus on Indigenous child welfare. By the end of June 2007 it had jumped by one-and-half thousand to 7,917,” Rudd said at the Australian National University on Monday evening.\n“Since then, the number has grown by about an additional thousand kids a year, so that by mid 2015, the most recent year of recorded data, it stood at 15,432. And of those 15,432, 32.9% or 4,955 children were not placed in accordance with the child placement principle.\n“That is, no Indigenous organisation was consulted, no extended family carer was found, no community carer was found. These kids were taken away.”\nRudd called for consideration of a new target. “Let’s see 100% of Indigenous kids placed within their wider family or Indigenous community in accordance with the provisions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child placement principle.\n“Let’s see the number of kids needing to be removed drop for the first time in a decade,” he said.\n“What I am sure of is that we cannot simply stand back and let the numbers of Indigenous children being removed grow year by year, without other options being tested within the wider Indigenous community.”\nIndigenous kids are still being removed from their families, more than ever before | Larissa Behrendt Read more\n“We do not want another generation of young Aboriginal children unnecessarily separated from their culture.\n“We do not want to see the emergence of a second stolen generation, not by design, but by default.”\nThe latest Closing the Gap report will be released in federal parliament on Tuesday.\nLast year’s snapshot revealed varied progress across the seven education, employment and health targets, and no progress in raising the life expectancy of Indigenous people.\nIndigenous adults are still likely to die 10 years earlier than other Australians. Last year’s report said the average life expectancy was 69 years for Indigenous men and 73 years for Indigenous women.\nTwo of the objectives were on track last year: the target to halve the gap in child mortality by 2018, and a target to improve Year 12 attainment by 2020.\nAhead of the release of the new snapshot, Turnbull paid tribute to Rudd’s apology in 2008.\n“It was a remarkable and historic moment. The galleries were filled, overwhelmingly, with our first Australians. There was almost no room in the great hall,” the prime minister said.\n“The area in front of parliament was a sea of humanity, expectation and support.\n“It’s an apology that today we reaffirm, and it’s an apology that has echoed through the years and will echo for centuries to come. It was an apology whose time had come.”\nTurnbull said as well as recognising the challenges, it was important to validate the success stories.\nHe said there were great stories of achievement, “and we are looking at them here in this House”.\n“The first Indigenous Australian to be a minister in a commonwealth government, Ken Wyatt, and Linda Burney ... the first Indigenous women to be a member of this House, and minister, of course, in the New South Wales government previously.\nAnother stolen generation: how Australia still wrecks Aboriginal families | John Pilger Read more\n“So there are great positive stories to tell, and we have to be focused on them as well.”\nThe Labor leader, Bill Shorten, acknowledged successes, but said profound challenges remained on the road to reconciliation. He said the parliament needed to take hope from the resilience of Indigenous people.\n“We should be taking hope from the resilience of Aboriginal people, drawing hope from the success of Aboriginal leadership, finding hope in the way that communities, locals, young people and their elders are tackling the problems they face, creating hope in a future where our first Australians have the first say in decisions which affect their lives – and with this hope, let us walk forward together in the spirit of the apology nine years ago today.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:16:23.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
