Picture: FOX 59 Staff writers, wires News Corp Australia Network Share Share on Twitter \nCHILLING audio on a mobile phone has captured video and the voice of a man who is now the main suspect in the murder of two teenage girls on a US hiking trail. \nLiberty German, 14, one of two teenage girls killed along a northern Indiana hiking trail used her mobile phone beforehand to capture video of the man who killer her and her friend, Abigail Williams, 13. \nIndiana State Police played a clip of the man’s voice during a news conference, where he can be heard saying: “down the hill”. \nLiberty also captured a grainy image released by police of a man walking near the hiking trail outside Delphi about the time she and Abigail disappeared on February 13. \nIndiana Police Captain David Bursten appealed for more tips from the public and announced that $US41,000 ($A53,423) in reward money had been raised to catch the girls’ killer. \nThe girls’ bodies were found the next day in a rugged wooded area off the trail, some 96 kilometres northwest of Indianapolis. \nHEAR THE AUDIO HERE The man filmed on Liberty’s mobile phone, who is on the run. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nBursten said investigators aren’t certain the voice was that of the man in the photograph whom investigators are calling the main suspect in the deaths. That man hasn’t been identified and no arrests have been made. \nOfficials declined to release more information about how the girls were killed and what else Liberty might have recorded on her phone. \n“She had the presence of mind to have the phone on and to capture video as well as audio,” Bursten said. \n“This young lady is a hero, there’s no doubt,” Indiana State Police Sgt. Tony Slocum told reporters, according to the Indy Star. \n“To have enough presence of mind to activate that video system on her cellphone, to record what we believe is criminal behaviour that’s about to occur,” Slocum said. Capt. David Bursten of the Indiana State Police is joined by law enforcement officials from numerous departments to provide the latest details of the investigation into the murders of Liberty German and Abigail Williams.

Picture: AP Source: AP \nThe girls’ bodies were found about a quarter-mile from an abandoned railroad bridge that’s part of the trail system where the teens had planned to hike during a day off school. \nBursten said while the quality of the audio clip is poor, investigators believed someone could recognise the voice of the person who was with the girls. \n“One of two things happened. It was a chance encounter — that’s possible. Don’t think it’s likely, but it’s possible,” Bursten said. \n“Or that person knew that they were going to be there. That’s possible as well.” \nThe police tip line for the case is: 844-459-5786.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:51:50.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
