PA:Press Association 6 Harry Redknapp has urged Arsenal to consider signing Wayne Rooney \nArsene Wenger has been in desperate need of player of the England man’s ilk this term – and is the necessary next step to getting his hands on the Premier League title once more, according to Redknapp . \nKeep up to date with ALL the Arsenal and Manchester United news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary. \nIn his column for the Standard, Redknapp wrote: “Arsenal should take a gamble and sign Wayne Rooney on a two-year contract. \n“There’s no love lost between Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger, but Petr Cech moved between the two managers and Wayne deserves the chance to choose his next move. Manchester United star Rooney misses Europa League trip to St Etienne due to injury PA:Press Association Arsene Wenger is a long-time admirer of Manchester United's Wayne Rooney \n\"It is pretty clear his time at Manchester United is coming to an end. \n\"Jose is saying all the right things publicly but his team selections make it obvious he doesn’t fancy him and that’s his choice as manager. \n\"He’s obviously a big player at the club but if you aren’t in the team, you are one step removed from all that and he won’t stand for it. Wayne Rooney is presented a trophy for being Manchester United leading all time top scorer Getty Images 6 Arsene Wenger's Arsenal are desperately lacking an on-pitch leader \n\"Wayne always wants to play and that’s what made him great.

AP:Associated Press 6 Arsenal have sorely missed an on-field leader like Tony Adams, says Harry Redknapp \n\"Kieran Gibbs did the same for half an hour against Bayern Munich last week when Laurent Koscielny got injured. Neither of them are true leaders. \n\"Say what you like about Wayne but his experience and will-to-win is up there with the very best. \n\"Arsene always had Tony Adams or Patrick Vieira to set standards and call people out for him.
