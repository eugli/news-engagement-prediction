Comedian Rosie O'Donnell tweeted Monday that she was was \"available\" to play top Trump adviser Steve Bannon on SNL , writing \"If called — I will be ready.\" Twitter users immediately leaped at the suggestion, while others took the opportunity to imagine an SNL skit with an all-female cast playing Trump's male-dominated administration. On Thursday night, O'Donnell gave us a taste of what that could look like when she swapped out her Twitter avatar with this face meld of her and Bannon: \nThis is now @Rosie's profile picture If Trump was miffed by McCarthy's portrayal of Spicer, one could only imagine the rage the president would feel upon seeing O'Donnell play Bannon. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump made a point of stoking his heated feud with O'Donnell, which began over a decade ago when she slammed Trump for his failed marriages and questioned his status as a \"self-made man\" on The View. Trump, of course, responded by calling O'Donnell and other women \"fat pigs,\" \"dogs,\" \"slobs\" and \"disgusting animals\" and defended these sexist insults during a September presidential debates. \"Somebody who's been very vicious to me [is] Rosie O'Donnell,\" Trump said at the time. \"I said very tough things to her. And I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.\" We're guessing O'Donnell believes Trump deserves whatever's coming his way, too.
