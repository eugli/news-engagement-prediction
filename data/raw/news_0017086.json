Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as attorney general, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., as secretary of health and human services and Steve Mnuchin as treasury secretary. This comes on the heels of the bitter debate over Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who was eventually confirmed Tuesday.\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn , R-Texas, said that the work needs to be done, and will get done, even if it requires 24-hour sessions.\n \nRelated Stories Two Super Bowl Champs Now Refusing To Attend White House Celebratory Visit DHS Secretary: Abrupt Immigration Order Rollout ‘Is All On Me’ British Lawmaker Criticized For Banning Trump Speech To Parliament, ‘Grandstanding’ “We can do it cooperatively so we can burn time when we’re out of session or if they won’t agree to that, we can stay in session 24 hours,” Cornyn said.\n“A lot of our members are happy to do that,” he said.\nThe current schedule calls for a final vote on Sessions Wednesday night, with votes coming on Friday for Price and Saturday for Mnuchin.\n \nUnder Senate rules, one Republican senator has to preside over the Senate when it is officially in session.\nDemocrats, however, promise to use as much time as possible.\n“We’re going to have long debates on Sessions and we’re going to have debates on Price,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\nThe confirmation votes are expected to be exercises in party-line voting.\n \nTrending Stories Pelosi: Trump’s Actions ‘Not Grounds For Impeachment’ W.Va. Senator Calls On Democrats To Put America First Suicide Bomber Strikes Afghanistan’s Supreme Court, Killing At Least 20 So far, only one Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., has said he will vote for Sessions, while not one Democrat has voiced support for either Price or Mnuchin. No Democrats supported DeVos on Monday.\nSchumer made clear that the nominees are pawns in a larger battle.\n“If not total unanimity, we’re going to have near Democratic unity in opposing the remaining nominees for President Trump’s Cabinet . This unity makes clear just how bad this Cabinet would be for America’s middle class and those struggling to get there, and bodes well for the major battles ahead, including over the Affordable Care Act.”\nRepublicans have criticized the Democrat’s delays.\n“The American people elected a new president last November. Democrats don’t have to like that decision, but they do have a responsibility to our country,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\nAs of Tuesday, five of Trump’s Cabinet picks had been confirmed. That stacks up against 12 Cabinet confirmations for former President Barack Obama’s Cabinet secretaries in 2009.\nFor some, such as Andrew Puzder, Trump’s pick to head the Department of Labor, confirmation hearings have not even been scheduled yet.\nWhat do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:36:17.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
