It’s a good thing Bellerin left the match, too, as Wenger revealed a hazy memory for his defender. \n“He didn’t know the score at the time,” Wenger said. \nWhether the goal should or shouldn’t have been allowed is certainly a valid debate. Players are allowed to use their arms for protection and leverage while jumping — you can’t expect them to leap with their arms at their sides — but contact with an opponent’s head is tough to overlook. It’s certainly a gray area, which the game is littered with, and that’s what makes for compelling discussion. \nWhat’s not up for debate is that Bellerin suffered a head injury and needed attention. Whether he or the Gunners staff decided he was unfit to carry on, Arsenal should be applauded for looking out for his well-being.
