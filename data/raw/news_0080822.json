The only option is an extension of the unconstitutional contract with CPS and its parent company Net1.\nShe has not filed any papers with the Constitutional Court, nor started renegotiations with CPS, she admitted.\nThe court’s two-year deadline to end the contract and find an alternative distribution channel is four weeks away. In 2014, the court declared the contract invalid, but suspended its order to give the department time to find a new service provider.\nThe DA has claimed that Dlamini forced the crisis to try and extend the contract at an inflated price of R1.3bn.\n“The DA will not stand for this and in Scopa we will be relentless in extracting the truth to once and for all clear the Sassa confusion and find a solution to this crisis,” DA MP Tim Brauteseth said on Monday.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=602694324&t=artid%3d130aeaa5-5054-4ef3-96a7-9e4b8ac486f3%26Companies%3dsassa%2cda%2cscopa%26People%3dbathabile+dlamini%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=602694324&t=artid%3d130aeaa5-5054-4ef3-96a7-9e4b8ac486f3%26Companies%3dsassa%2cda%2cscopa%26People%3dbathabile+dlamini%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1"], "published": "2017-02-28T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:11:52.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
