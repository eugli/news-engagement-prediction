Though notoriously picky about the roles he plays and subsequently embodies (his name isn't synonymous with method acting for nothing), Day-Lewis has finally found the project to mark his screen return. Reuniting with his There Will Be Blood director Paul Thomas Anderson (Day-Lewis won the Best Actor Oscar for that film in 2008), the 59-year-old actor will tackle an unexpected setting—the fashion industry—in his new movie. On Wednesday, Focus Features revealed the film's plot in a press release about the start of filming: \"Mr. Anderson will once again explore a distinctive milieu of the 20th century. The new movie is a drama set in the couture world of 1950s London. The story illuminates the life behind the curtain of an uncompromising dressmaker commissioned by royalty and high society.\"\n This week, the first image of Day-Lewis on set in England emerged ; it shows the actor standing in a cemetery, wearing a blue overcoat and gray trousers, his gray hair cleanly slicked back. Photographer Glenn Kilpatrick captured the photo as well as more images of the set (you can see them here ), and writes on his site that signs nearby refer to the project as Phantom Thread .\nGlenn Kilpatrick", "external_links": ["https://www.whitby-photography.com/daniel-day-lewis-filming-whitby-yorkshire-today/", "http://theplaylist.net/new-cast-members-logline-revealed-paul-thomas-andersons-new-film-starring-daniel-day-lewis-jonny-greenwood-20170201/", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/05/1600x800/gallery-1486144370-hbz-daniel-day-lewis-index-getty.jpg", "http://www.vulture.com/2017/01/set-photos-daniel-day-lewis-paul-thomas-anderson.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/movies/daniel-day-lewis-on-playing-abraham-lincoln.html", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/05/640x320/gallery-1486143733-hbz-daniel-day-lewis-index.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/05/480x240/gallery-1486143733-hbz-daniel-day-lewis-index.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/05/1600x800/gallery-1486143733-hbz-daniel-day-lewis-index.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/05/768x384/gallery-1486143733-hbz-daniel-day-lewis-index.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-04T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:12:58.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
