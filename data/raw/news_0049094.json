Not just on American soil, people across the globe came together to protest against the president‚Äôs sexists remarks and the Women‚Äôs March held a day after the inauguration was massive.\nAs the new president completes one month of his presidency on February 20, large demonstrations were held against him but this time outside the US. Yes, thousands of people took to streets in various cities in the UK, protesting against Donald Trump‚Äôs impending visit to Britain. ‚ÄúThousands of protesters gathered outside Parliament and across the UK this evening as MPs debated Donald Trump‚Äôs state visit to Britain,‚Äù the Metro, UK reported. The mega debate began after more than two million signed a petition to halt the billionaire politician from an official visit to the UK. ‚ÄúMPs are also considering an alternative petition, backed by almost 312,000 signatories, demanding the state visit goes ahead,‚Äù the report added.\nAs the British Prime Minister Theresa May made it clear that nothing will stop the POTUS from visiting the country, opposition MPs, celebrities, and common people all came out to protest against the invitation.\n#stoptrump he‚Äôs not welcome in london, he‚Äôs not welcome in Brum! pic.twitter.com/QiqqpNpkCt\n‚Äî olivia (@sanabakkkoushs) February 21, 2017\nAnti-Trump placards were seen and slogans could be heard from Parliament Square much before the debate even started.
