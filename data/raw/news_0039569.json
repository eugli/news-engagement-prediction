And Roth’s motivations are very personal. Mark Roth LinkedIn Roth, president of ECC Management LLC, is leading the effort to develop Luna Azul on 16th Street near Beardsley Road in north Phoenix. The subdivision will have 30 individually owned cottages geared toward adults with disabilities. Roth’s 17-year-old daughter Emma was born with a rare genetic condition. Roth said he started to worry about her quality of life when she would be an adult and came up with idea for the gated community. “Will she have to live in a group home?,” Roth said. Luna Azul is slated to have 30 independently owned cottages geared towards occupants with disability challenges. The cottages run between 1,100 and 1,700 square feet and are priced between $200,000 and the high $400,000s. Roth said individual property owners will be responsible for the care of occupants in their cottages. But there will be a 24/7 on-site manager and social activities. Construction is slated to start this summer with delivery in 2018, Roth said. Roth spent more than two decades as a securities law attorney. That included some real estate deals. He has brought on architect Ross Chapin to design the Phoenix project. Chapin specializes in infill pocket neighborhoods. Roth said he read about Chapin and his designs in The New York Times . “I didn’t want to copy his designs. I wanted him,” Roth said. Roth said he’s already got reservations sold or pending on 11 units. He’s also fielding calls and seeing interest in additional similar developments.
