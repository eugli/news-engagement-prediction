That’s a joke and a waste of money,” Price said.\n“I mean good luck to them, I think as an amateur pursuit it’s great but don’t try to turn it into something it’s not.”\nBad timing. Source: Supplied \nPrice refused to change his views even after being confronted by Aussie swimming legend Lisa Curry.\nThe Olympic champion asked the 62-year-old why he was not supportive of the women’s league.\n“Why are women given a hard go in sport just because it may not be a spectator sport, you could say the same about swimming,’ she said.\n“I got $2000 my whole career — everything else I earned myself.”\nEven that was not enough for Price to change his tune.\n“I’m a big supporter of women’s sport Lisa, but I’d give more of a voice to minor women’s sport than to that,” Price said.\nPrice was also heavily criticised by his long-term rival and radio veteran John Laws earlier this week for exposing their feud during filming on I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Here .\nPrice last week claimed he and Laws had fallen out more than a decade ago, only for Laws to deny his claims .\nIt comes as the stunning crowds of more than 50,000 across the four matches played in the opening round were heralded as a game-changer for women’s sport broadcasts in Australia.\nHuge success. Source: Getty Images \nMedia analyst Dr Kate Greenwood has described the AFL Women’s competition’s ability to attract crowds and grow the sport through free-to-air television exposure as a “dream scenario”.\nThe author of Australian Sports Commission’s 2010 report Towards a level playing field: sport and gender in Australian media \nsaid the AFL Women’s competition is already in uncharted territory that netball and women’s football has been unable to reach.\n“It is really amazing,” Dr Greenwood told abc.net.au .\n“How they have used the media really intelligently to engage the audience, how they have worked with broadcasters to get it on prime time and also for the audience to watch that in record numbers.\n“It was almost inconceivable, getting broadcasters to take the risk to show the sport, and then of course engaging all the fans and supporters as well. This is really the dream scenario,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:04:27.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
