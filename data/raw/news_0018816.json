Netflix releases full seasons of shows at once, sometimes on Friday. Amazon and Hulu saw relatively stable viewership percentage throughout the week. \nHere's a summary of the top network on each day, and what share of the viewership they got: Monday: CBS at 24% (\"Big Bang Theory,\" which has been moved to Thursdays) Tuesday: NBC at 23% (\"The Voice\" and \"This Is Us\") Wednesday: ABC at 22% (\"Modern Family\" and \"Black-ish\") Thursday: ABC at 23% (\"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"How to Get Away with Murder,\" \"Scandal\") Friday: CBS at 23%", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:37:03.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
