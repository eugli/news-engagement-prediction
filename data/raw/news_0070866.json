A famine has been declared some parts. The BBC's Alastair Leithead has been to the rebel-held town Thonyor in Leer County, where people have been told to gather to get help. \nThey emerged from the marshlands of the Nile in their thousands, as word spread that help had come. \nForced by fighting to live on the isolated islands of the Sudd swamps, they have been surviving for months on wild plants. \nNow they sat on the dry, cracked earth in long lines under a brutal sun - mostly women and children - waiting to register for the food aid which would be air-dropped in a few days time. \n\"We are only surviving by eating wild honey and water lilies from the river,\" said Nyambind Chan Kuar as she sat with 16 of her children and grandchildren. \n\"The fighting has been disastrous - children have been killed, they are taking our things, our cattle, our goats, taking everything, even though we have nothing to do with this war.\" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Thousands have been hiding from the fighting in swampland \nEach person is given a card that entitles them to 30 days of food rations when supplies arrive. Their finger is then stained with ink to avoid duplication. \n\"People are dying because of this hunger,\" said Mary Nyayain. \"That's why we are here queuing for these tokens.\" 'I spent days hiding in a swamp' \nThe town of Thonyor in Leer County was chosen as the central point for distributing aid after long negotiations with both sides in the civil war. \nIt's one of the four counties in Unity State suffering pockets of famine, which the latest hunger assessment says is affecting 100,000 people. \nLeer is the birthplace of the former vice-president turned rebel leader Riek Machar which is perhaps why it has been the centre of so much fighting. Image copyright Reuters Image caption People in Unity State say they have been eating water lilies to survive \nThonyor is controlled by the rebels or the \"IO\" as they're known - forces \"In Opposition\" - but the government troops are just 20 minutes up the road. \n\"The war has been so difficult for us,\" said another woman waiting in line for a cholera vaccination. \n\"Especially for the old women who are not able to run to the river to survive in the islands. Our cows and goats were taken so that's why we are only able to survive through the food agency.\" \nUnder each tree is a different medical post - with health checks for the children. \nThe worst cases of malnutrition are treated straight away. Image copyright Reuters Image caption About 36,000 people are expected to be registered - but the UN says thousands more are cut off by rivers or fighting \n\"You may think this child is actually very healthy - he's fat, he's looking OK,\" said James Bwirani from the Food and Agriculture Organisation. \n\"But this is just water accumulating in the body and he has not been consuming adequate food for some time.\" \nThe child has a distended belly and his face and limbs are swollen. \n\"If left untreated for between a week to two weeks, this child is going to be dead,\" Mr Bwirani said. \nThe UN World Food Programme (WFP) is coordinating this emergency response, expecting about 36,000 people to come in from the swamps for help. Image copyright AP Image caption Leer County is the birthplace of rebel leader Riek Machar, who has fled the country \nBut there are many thousands more who are too far away, cut off by rivers or in areas where the government and the rebels have not agreed to provide access. \n\"For many, many months humanitarian agencies have not been able to make it into this area. This is first time we're doing so,\" said George Fominyen from the WFP. \n\"Without safety, without assurance of security for the people that are in need and the aid workers, we'll be having a catastrophic situation down the line.\" \nThe UN describes this as \"a man-made famine\" - created by the civil war which has divided the army and the country largely along ethnic lines. \nA political row between President Salva Kiir and Mr Machar led to killings in the capital and fighting which has spread across the country. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The UN says the \"man-made\" famine has been caused by the civil war \nThe war has displaced millions of people, many into neighbouring countries, and 40% of the population now depends on international aid. \nMr Machar fled South Sudan in July when a fragile peace deal collapsed. \nHe is currently in South Africa, unable to return but apparently still commanding his troops by phone. \nLeer county commissioner Brig Gen Nhial Phan said there won't be peace until Mr Machar is allowed back to take part in a proposed national dialogue. \nHe believes President Kiir wants to drive people out of his county. Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Leer County officials accuse President Kiir of orchestrating the bloodshed \n\"The government kills people - their militia is raiding, taking cows, killing and burning the church and the houses, forcing people into the islands,\" he said. \nThere are scorch marks where the market used to be and the remains of a Medecins Sans Frontieres clinic, destroyed when the government forces took the town for two days last November. \nBy getting help in fast, aid agencies hope to pull this region back from famine and stop the famine from spreading - if they are allowed to access to the worst affected areas.
