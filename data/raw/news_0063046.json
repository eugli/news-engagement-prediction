H. Faleomavaega, third from right, being sworn in as American Samoa’s congressional delegate in 2011. Credit Susan Walsh/Associated Press Eni F. H. Faleomavaega, American Samoa’s longest-serving nonvoting delegate to the House of Representatives, died on Wednesday at his home in Provo, Utah. He was 73. His death was confirmed by his sister-in-law, Therese Hunkin. She did not specify the cause. Mr. Faleomavaega, a Democrat, became a congressional delegate in 1989 for American Samoa, a United States territory in the South Pacific, and held the position for 13 consecutive terms, until 2014. His position allowed him to vote in a committee, but not on the House floor. He was a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the House Committee on Natural Resources. In 1996, Mr. Faleomavaega participated in a boycott of an address before a joint session of Congress by President Jacques Chirac of France. Days before Mr. Chirac’s speech, France conducted a series of nuclear tests at the Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls in the South Pacific, despite worldwide protests. Mr. Faleomavaega’s wife, Hinanui Hunkin, said, “I am so grateful for the trust that the people of American Samoa, for so many years, placed in him as their servant.” She survives him, as do his five children and 10 grandchildren. Born Eni Hunkin in Vailoatai Village, Mr. Faleomavaega began his political career in 1973 as an administrative assistant to A. U. Fuimaono, a paramount chief and American Samoa’s first elected representative to Washington. He was staff counsel to the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs from 1975 to 1981 before returning to American Samoa as its deputy attorney general. In 1985, he was elected lieutenant governor.
