Though the cold-blooded creature tried to dig its claws into the restaurant's floor, it was no match for this hot-blooded hostess. (Mimosa Wines/Facebook) \n\"Every time he tried to reach me, I'd just lift him up. He's quite heavy,\" Lila told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation . \"I just figured if I do this, he's never going to reach my hand, and I was just focused on his mouth.\" \nConn. police warn locals against trusting 'any unfamiliar cattle' \nGoannas are predatory lizards with sharp claws and mouths full of serrated teeth and venom, though it's not dangerous for humans. \n\"I like reptiles, I think he is a really beautiful creature (and) I didn't want to hurt him,\" said Lila, who is originally from France. \nThe first time she had ever seen a goanna was just four days before the reptile attempted to get some takeout but instead got taken out.
