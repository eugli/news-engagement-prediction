Advertisement \nMr Wood's barrister Bruce McClintock, SC, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday that a central part of the Crown case was the evidence of Associate Professor Rod Cross and a photograph of The Gap, purported to be taken in 1996. \nThe jury at the trial saw the photograph, which showed bushes against the safety rail at the clifftop, and were told Mr Wood chose that spot because he could get a four metre run-up, and be obscured from sight.

During the course of the trial ... he was writing a book, which was ultimately published by the University of NSW Press under the title Evidence For Murder: How Physics Convicted a Killer . \"It wouldn't have been much of a book, or its sales wouldn't have been particularly great, if its title had been ... something like 'How Dodgy Data Failed To Convict an Innocent Man'. \"It really is breathtaking ... that this man could ever have been put on as some form of expert.\" \nMr McClintock said Mr Wood was \"singularly unlucky\" that Ms Byrne had an ex-boyfriend, Andrew Blanchette​, who was a police officer and who \"unquestionably hated [Mr Wood]\". \nMr Blanchette​ was a \"thoroughly dishonest man\", who directed Ms Byrne's former employer, deportment coach June Dally-Watkins to take photographs at The Gap. \n\"He persuaded Ms Dally-Watkins to play Miss Marple and run around The Gap taking photographs, and showing people,\" Mr McClintock said, referring to the fictional detective in Agatha Christie's crime novels. \nMr McClintock said he would be heavily relying on the Court of Criminal Appeal's \"serious\" findings about Crown prosecutor Mark Tedeschi, QC, including that he made submissions to the jury without any evidence. \n\"[There was] a prosecutor who, to put it mildly, was prepared to bend the rules,\" Mr McClintock said. \nMr Wood is in court, sitting behind his barrister, closely following proceedings. \nThe hearing continues before Justice Elizabeth Fullerton.
