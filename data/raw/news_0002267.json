The midseason premiere of The Walking Dead season 7 sounds like it'll be just what the doctor ordered. A new promo featuring some of the main cast and crew has been released, and everyone's teasing the same thing: this is when things get hairy. \n\"They weren't ready, they weren't in a place where they could fight, they are now.\" - showrunner Scott Gimple. \n\"We're rebuilding, and we're together again. Or at least it's the beginning of the resistance.\" - Andrew Lincoln, aka Rick Grimes. \n\"In the second half of season 7, there's a storm coming.\" - Lennie James, aka Morgan. \nAnd my personal favorite: \"What we're building toward the end of [season] 7 is Rick trying to re-emerge and find himself again, and Negan is still there with a big smile on his face, waiting. We're getting to the breaking point.\" - Jeffrey Dean Morgan, aka Negan. \nThe Walking Dead season 7 returns on February 12. And if what everyone's saying is more than just teases, it sounds like it'll be quite the show. \nSeen something newsworthy? !
