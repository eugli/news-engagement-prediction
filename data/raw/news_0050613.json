But we get caught up in this whole child abuse thing even to the extent we are policing consensual relationships between consenting adults, such as grad students and professors at universities. 'The whole consent thing is not as black and white as people try and paint it.' Yiannopoulos agreed that the age of consent was 'roughly' at the right age. Yiannopulos is due to address the Conservative Political Action Conference 2017 The controversial columnist is often greeted by protests, such as this one earlier this month in Berkeley, California where he was forced to cancel a planned speech due to the demonstration He continued: 'There are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age. I would certainly consider myself to be one of them, people who are sexually active younger. 'I think it particularly happens in the gay world, by the way. In many cases… actually, those relationships… this is one of the reasons I hate the left. This one-size-fits-all policing of culture. This arbitrary and oppressive idea of consent, which totally destroys, you know, the understanding that many of us have, of the complexities, subtleties and complicated nature of many relationships. ‘People are messy and complex, particularly in the homosexual world. Some of those relationships between younger boys and older men, the sort of “coming of age” relationships, the relationships in which those older men help those young boys to discover who they are, and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable rock where they can’t speak to their parents.' Yiannopoulos said: 'Pedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty. Pedophilia is an attraction to people who don’t have functioning sex organs yet, who have not gone through puberty, who are too young to understand about the bodies. That is not what we are talking about. ‘You don’t understand what pedophilia is if you thing I’m defending it, because I’m certainly not.' Yiannopoulos suggested a relationship between 'younger boys and older men' can be 'hugely positive experiences for the young boys' saving them from possible 'suicide and drugs' Yiannopoulos claimed some teenagers could find a relationship with an older man quite beneficial. He added: 'In the gay world, some of the most enriching and incredibly life-affirming and shaping relationships, very often between younger boys and older men, can be hugely positive experiences for those young boys. They can save those young boys from desolation, suicide and drug addiction, all sorts of things, providing they’re consensual.' Later, Yiannopoulos wrote on Facebook blaming deceptive editing and his own 'sloppy phrasing' for any indication he supported pedophilia. He said he spoke of his own relationship when he was 17 with a man who was 29. The age of consent in the UK is 16. It's unclear who edited the videos. The video was published by the Reagan Battalion, a blog that describes itself as 'news, information, commentary, from a conservative perspective'. According to a Facebook post, Yiannopoulos insisted he should have used the term young men as opposed to young boys. According to a statement on The Daily Caller , Yiannopoulos attempted to defuse the scandal. He said: 'I do not support pedophilia. Period. It is a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst. There are selectively edited videos doing the rounds, as part of a co-ordinated effort to discredit me from establishment Republicans, that suggest I am soft on the subject.' He added: 'I did say that there are relationships between younger men and older men that can help a young gay man escape from a lack of support or understanding at home. That’s perfectly true and every gay man knows it. But I was not talking about anything illegal and I was not referring to pre-pubescent boys. 'I shouldn’t have used the word \"boy\" when I talked about those relationships between older men and younger gay men.' Yiannopoulos suggested there may be an ulterior motive in trying to ban him from the event this weekend. He added: 'This rush to judgment from establishment conservatives who hate Trump as much as they hate me, before I have had any chance to provide context or a response, is one of the big reasons gays vote Democrat.'
