Which airplanes are most efficient with which routes and under what weather conditions (seasonality)? Which airplanes are “easiest” to maintain? Which airplane configurations are most fuel efficient? Which airplane configurations get the highest passenger satisfaction and referral ratings from the airlines’ “most valuable” passengers? Which airplanes are easiest to re-configure? Routes: Which routes are most efficient from an operational as well as performance perspective? Which routes are most efficient under weather conditions (seasonality)? Which routes to the same destinations get the highest satisfaction, Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and referral ratings from the airline’s “most valuable” passengers? Which routes have the lowest percentage of weather-induced delays? Pilots: Which pilots are most efficient from an operational as well as performance perspective? What are the background characteristics (tenure, experience, certification, training, demographics, behaviors) of the “best” pilots”? Which pilots are most effective on which routes and under what weather conditions? \nI think you can start to see the realm of what’s possible (if not, you may want to sign up for one of our Vision Workshops) with respect to the types and levels of insights that can be gathered about the organization’s key business entities even from activities that start out to “save me more money” perspective. Transportation Industry at Phase IV \nLet’s see another example of Phase IV in action: transportation. Let’s say that you operate a fleet of vehicles (company cars, rental cars, taxis, limos, delivery trucks, shipping trucks, etc.). While the car and truck manufacturers could (and probably will) offer analytics to help fleet operators to reduce their operating and maintenance costs, the operators of those vehicles should care about the analytics because those vehicles are emitting tons of potentially valuable data about customer preferences and usage patterns, travel congestion, destination preferences and product performance. For example: What features are most used on the car (could guide the development, pricing and packaging of vehicle features)? What radio stations are most used on the car (could create digital marketing and cross-sell opportunities)? What routes do passengers take most often (could create data that might be valuable to city and road planners, and could also create marketing and promotional opportunities for nearby services)? Where are the most common destinations by what times of the year (could create marketing and promotional opportunities)? Where do most accidents take place (could be used by insurance companies to set rates and by city management for road maintenance planning)? What driving patterns are most unusual (could be used to identify potentially drunk drivers, texting drivers or drivers playing Pokemon Go) Etc. \nIn fact, the “exhaust” from the operation of these vehicles could be more valuable than the vehicle itself!! Summary \nIt’s very seductive to chase after the “low hanging fruit” by choosing to outsource your big data “save me more money” efforts. And there is nothing wrong with those short-term wins. \nHowever, organizations should not make short-term cost-saving decisions that sacrifice the longer-term monetization and competitive differentiation opportunities. If everyone is using the same analysis to run their businesses, then where are the sources of competitive differentiation? \nIf you look at analytics just as a way to drive out costs, then you probably should outsource as much analytics as possible. However, if you believe that the exhaust from your product and service usage might be more valuable than the product and/or service itself, then you need to embrace big data analytics as a source of competitive differentiation. \nYes Dan, our Big Data challenge is up-hill both directions! \n[1] “White space” is defined as unmet and unarticulated needs in the market. It is where products and services don’t exist based on the present understanding of values, customer needs or existing competencies.
