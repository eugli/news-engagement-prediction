After all, you either win an award at the end of the night, or you don’t. By that metric, the answer is obvious. Adele won. Radiohead lost. Drake won. Kanye lost. But we all know the takeaways at each ceremony run much deeper. This is how a band like Twenty One Pilots can feel like losers even while holding trophies. And it’s why Rihanna didn’t need to get up on stage to steal the show. So, throw out the scorecard and check out the real winners and losers at the 2017 Grammy Awards. \nWinner: Rihanna \nSure, we could focus on the lack of actual Grammy awards that Anti and “Work” managed to take home on Sunday night.
