If the Prime Minister were really acting in the national interest, she would be representing them too. She would be pursuing a 'one nation Brexit' not a partisan hard, right wing Brexit.\" GETTY The House of Lords debate on the Brexit Bill will start today \nLord Hain will also insist the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic is kept open, something he considers essential to the Brexit negotiations. \nHaving served as Northern Ireland Secretary under Tony Blair, Hain will tell his fellow peers: \"A 'one nation Brexit' would also mean guaranteeing a completely open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic - no security checks, no controls, physical or electronic.” \nLord Hain will also push for Britain’s single market membership to be maintained because he believes losing access will have a “devastating” impact on the economy. PA Lord Hain has vowed to vote against the Bill on a number of occasions \nHe will argue: \"Cutting us off from our biggest market, where nearly half our trade is done, will have devastating consequences for the economy, for jobs and for millions of individual citizens' lives. \n\"We now learn that if we cannot get the EU trade deal we want, the Government threatens, in a 'Trump Brexit', to make Britain a low tax 'haven' with lower labour and environmental regulation, in an attempt to attract foreign firms once we have left the EU. \n\"That would also mean continued shrinking of the state, even more savage cuts in public services and even greater inequality, hitting hardest the poorest and most vulnerable citizens.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:35:39.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
