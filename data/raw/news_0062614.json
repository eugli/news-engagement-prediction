Well, on my first day covering backstage at the fashion shows for Milan fashion week, the seemingly gimmicky, yet surprisingly genius liquid liner made a second appearance, this time being used to create the look for No. 21's fall 2017 show. Makeup artist Tom Pecheux went with a subtle burgundy-lined, gold-tinged lid for the show. \"It's a step up from natural makeup, I call it luxury natural makeup,\" he said, choosing to trace the top lashes in a maroon color and spreading a shimmery warm golden cream over the eyelids. \"People don't realize that burgundy really brings out any color irises ,\" said Pecheux. \"Any color, but especially light eyes like blue, green, and hazel.\" You May Also Like Makeup Smoky Eye Urban Decay Naked Palette To create the burgundy hue, however, Pecheux layered a few products, And he started with...drumroll please...the M.A.C. pizza cutter eyeliner (whose working name is Roller Wheel, or at least that's what is written on the tester packaging I saw backstage) in a shiny brown color. After running it along the top lashes, Pecheux then spread a \"golden, slightly mustard-yellow cream\" all over the lids, traced metallic maroon powder over the line he made with the Roller Wheel, and finished by blurring all the colors together with M.A.C. Coffee Pencil (a medium warm brown color). There's still no information on the launch date, but I did get an update on how well the M.A.C. pizza cutter eyeliner performs. \"It works really well when you use it on yourself,\" said Pecheux, \"but it's a little hard to apply on other people—we're using it because it stays for a very long time.\" (Pecheux and his team used a brush to apply the shiny liquid formula.) Using it on yourself, however, is life-changing according to two female makeup artists on Pecheux's team that I overheard talking about the new product. \"You get a perfectly straight line every time, it's insane,\" one said. You can see for yourself below, in a Boomerang I took of them running the liner over the back of your hand. Kind of mesmerizing, no? Loading M.A.C. makeup artist Ashley Rudder also just put up a video of her trying it out on her Instagram, with a short review in the caption: Loading View on Instagram As a fairly seasoned beauty editor (this is my 13th season covering backstage in New York, Milan, and Paris), I was completely ready to write off the M.A.C. pizza cutter liner as a gimmick. But after seeing it in person, and hearing from female makeup artists who actually wear makeup on a daily basis, I have to say I'm convinced—and hoping M.A.C. decides to launch this interesting eyeliner innovation very soon.
