Is having your chi balanced covered by Medicare?\" wrote Colin Dooley. \n\"I don't understand why JCU would allow a space on campus to be rented by the clinic as it infers and (sic) endorsement by JCU,\" wrote Snombat Linda. \n\"People may laugh and make fun of what they don't understand, but I congratulate you, JCU,\" wrote Louise Judges. \nThe operators of the clinic, Healing Touch Townsville, are meeting this week to discuss the decision. \nThe ABC has approached both JCU and the clinic's operators for comment.
