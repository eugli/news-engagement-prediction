Editor Advertisement \nAnother crazy taxi driver. Take them all off the roads! The taxi driver who drove his taxi several times against cars at Old Airport Road now claimed that his taxi had mechanical failure, and he had no control over the taxi. \nSo, blame the taxi, sure can get away with it! The taxi driver never heard of pulling out the ignition keys, if mechanical failure really was the problem ah? No key, no ignition, no engine running, no way the taxi can go back and forth violently. Lucky no one was actually standing near, or he could have been rammed by this crazy driver! \nLet the investigations be completed. Sure the findings will show the only fault is not mechanical, but driver. \nSimone Loy \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
