My default emotion would be to break EVERYTHING within arm’s reach. \nWould you even blame me? Giphy \nThere is not one fucking person on this planet who would be totally cool with being compared to Nickelback… I mean, it’s fucking Nickelback, dude! \nThey had a good thing going before quickly becoming the laughing stalk of the music industry. There has been a significant amount of research conducted to determine WHY Nickelback sucks. \nThat’s how much they suck (sorry, Chad)! Giphy \nDuring her study of the Canadian band, Salli Anttonen over at the University of Eastern Finland concluded , \nNickelback is too much of everything to be enough of something. They follow genre expectations too well, which is seen as empty imitation, but also not well enough, which is read as commercial tactics and as a lack of a stable and sincere identity. \nThat explains why most people probably expected The Chainsmokers to freak out over the Esquire article. But NOPE, they took it like champs and now, they might just be a Nickelback cover band that’s better than Nickelback. \nIn a recent clip shared on Twitter by the duo, Alex Pall and Drew Taggart begin singing an acoustic version of their song “Paris.” \nJust before the video ends, The Chainsmokers make sure to take a jab at Esquire as Taggart belts out the lyrics to Nickelback’s “How You Remind Me” as Pall plays the piano. Behold The Chainsmokers channeling their inner-Nickelback. It’s safe to say they’re a Nickelband cover band that is better than Nickelback. . @esquire @Official_MattM It's not like you to say sorry so.. pic.twitter.com/7zS38kauWI \n— THE CHAINSMOKERS (@TheChainsmokers) January 31, 2017 \nI’ll be honest here. Taggart’s Chad Kroeger impression is pretty spot-on. \nAnd strangely, I kind of want to listen to some old Nickelback tracks… said no one ever! \nHey, Chainsmokers, don’t feel too bad about the comparison. President Obama’s gotten the same thing. \nIt happens to the best of us!
