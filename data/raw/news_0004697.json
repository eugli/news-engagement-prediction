Day-to-day struggle \nShe says the heart condition has presented itself differently in each of them. \n\"Maninder had to give up a promising career in rugby, but is now leading a relatively normal life. But Manvir and I struggle day-to-day with our health. \n\"Manvir can't finish a whole day at school. He is constantly tired and his energy levels are very low. He is mainly home-schooled now as it is hard for him to keep up with his work. \n\"He also misses out on seeing his friends as he can't do the normal activities most 15-year-olds can do.\" \nThey have both had implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) fitted to prevent their hearts from stopping suddenly. \nResearch has helped to discover many of the faulty genes that cause inherited heart conditions. \nThis has led to the development of structured genetic testing services for those at highest risk for some of these conditions. More research urged \nHowever, the British Heart Foundation says more research is urgently needed. \nProf Sir Nilesh Samani, BHF medical director, said: \"The reality is that there are hundreds of thousands of people across the UK who are unaware that they could be at risk of sudden death. \n\"If undetected and untreated, inherited heart conditions can be deadly and they continue to devastate families, often by taking away loved ones without warning. \n\"We urgently need to fund more research to better understand these heart conditions, make more discoveries, develop new treatments and save more lives.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:07:19.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
