Man United roasted as Liverpool push them down the table \nThe upshot of Liverpool’s win was that Jurgen Klopp’s side held onto fifth place in the Premier League. \nIt also meant that Man United remain in sixth spot after round 25 of the campaign. \nThat lead to plenty of comments on social media. \nEnjoy the Liverpool v Man United banter below. Opposition fans gleefully declaring that United are still 6th but ignoring that we've closed the gap on 2nd to 2pts (as it stands). Manchester United spent about half an hour in 5th place. \nBack to 6th they go. pic.twitter.com/n4AJz6jdO4 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T21:35:07.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
