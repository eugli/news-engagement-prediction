He has come back from a big setback. It was a big first match for him and he had it in his heart to help us out of the relegation zone. \n“I think he has really helped us. He had to deal with his return and it went really well. I think this is a really important win for us. It had been a long time since we won at home and it is a big, big boost for what is to come.” Sakho impressed on his debut for the Eagles (Photo: Alex Morton) Benteke himself suffered a frustrating afternoon (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) Read More Crystal Palace 1-0 Middlesbrough: Van Aanholt strike secures vital win for Eagles \nSakho, who has joined Palace until the end of the season, insisted the first Premier League win at Selhurst Park since December 3 was a team effort. \n“We had some meetings together to change what wasn’t working,” said the France defender. “You can say that this little break did us good – we didn’t have a match last weekend. We bonded and worked together and talked a lot and I think this match was very, very positive. \n“And physically I feel really good. I haven’t played for 10 months but I am someone who stays professional, works enormously. I am really proud to be involved in this victory. \n“And the most important thing for me is to get back on the pitch and refind the pleasure of playing football, especially when I always have this awareness that I can make a living from my passion.” Patrick van Aanholt scored the Eagles winner (Photo: Alex Morton) \nAllardyce took a risk in his pre-match press conference by criticising his players for not heeding his instructions. \n“Well it got across today, didn’t it, “ said Wayne Hennessey. “I thought we were fantastic. That was the best we played under him.” \nPalace now have the Allardyce feel with a big goalkeeper, new centre-backs, Serb Luka Milivojevic patrolling the midfield and Benteke the target man down the spine of the side. It is a formula which has never seen him relegated. \nThe winning goal after 34 minutes came from Patrick van Aanholt, the January signing from Sunderland where Big Sam avoided the drop last season. \n“It’s two totally different football clubs, and if I can make any comparison, it’s what Patrick and Mama Sakho brought to the team today,” said the former England manager. “That bit more quality.” poll loading Are Crystal Palace getting relegated? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:52:29.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
