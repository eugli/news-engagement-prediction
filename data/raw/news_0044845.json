On Feb. 12, deputies and medical technicians in Brantley County responded to a child in respiratory distress, according to the report. The mother, Marley Rena Wilson, 18, said she put the child down with a bottle of milk and five minutes later “they heard her having problems breathing,” according to the incident report from the Brantley County Sheriff’s Office. Wilson also said she and her boyfriend, James Paul Cutshall, 19, performed CPR on the girl, according to the report. The child later died at a hospital in Waycross.
