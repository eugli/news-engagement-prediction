Everything like rain, bad weather… I need to feel happy outside Antoine Griezmann on joining Manchester United \n“I have a lot of doubts about moving to England,” he told French radio station RMC Sport.“With Real Sociedad, I felt that I needed to leave. For the moment, I do not know where that desire came from. Who knows how the season will finish. If it finishes badly, maybe I will ask myself the question. For the moment, it is not relevant…\"Aside from that, I am asking myself where I could go. In Spain, there is Barcelona and Real Madrid. Barcelona have the three up top [Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar]. “Real Madrid, that is impossible because of the club I am at [Atletico]. I think that between them, there is a pact.\"Germany, the league does not attract me much. France, not for the moment. And England, I have a lot of doubts about my private life. Everything like rain, bad weather… I need to feel happy outside.\"Griezmann’s international team-mate Paul Pogba has been hard at work convincing his friend to swap Madrid for Manchester.The pair helped France reach the final of Euro 2016 last summer, before losing on penalties to Portugal in heartwreching fashion.Griezmann also reached the final of the Champions League last season, but lost on penalties to Real Madrid.The 25-year-old’s achievements saw him earn third place in the Ballon d’Or rankings behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi.And in an interview with FIFA to celebrate the award, Frenchman Griezmann insisted he was happy at Atletico and revealed he feels “very Spanish”.“I feel great at the club and in Madrid,” he said. “On a personal level I’m very happy, and in football terms we’re about to move to a new stadium, which is very important. “We’ll just have to see what the future brings, but for now I’m very happy here and I hope to win trophies with this club.“The fact is I do feel very Spanish, like when I’m talking to my wife and daughter in Spanish at two in the afternoon. I even think in Spanish when I get angry! “So, yes, it’s true. Things change completely when I pull on the national team jersey, though. All my love is for France when that happens, no doubt about it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:22:37.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
