And over the weekend, Sears Holdings, the parent company of US retail stores Sears and Kmart, pulled 31 Trump-branded products from its website.

Donald Trump , who sat across from his daughter, said Ivanka “is very much involved” in issues pertaining to women in the workplace. \nIvanka’s proximity to the administration has nonetheless come under increased scrutiny as her brand has begun to fall under the weight of her father’s political profile. \nEarlier this month, Nordstrom became the first major retailer to stop selling Ivanka’s merchandise, citing a decline in sales. Luxury department store Neiman Marcus soon followed suit and dropped Ivanka’s jewelry line. \nSales of Ivanka’s products at Nordstrom had dropped more than 70% in the weeks before the 8 November election, according to internal data reported by the Wall Street Journal. \nFollowing Nordstrom’s decision, Donald Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer publicly denounced the retailer for what they dubbed a political decision. \n“My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom,” Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday. Donald Trump's criticism of Nordstrom raises ethical concerns, senator says Read more \nSpicer meanwhile called Nordstrom’s move a “direct attack” on the president’s policies and Ivanka’s name. \nKellyanne Conway, Trump’s senior counselor, arguably lit the biggest fire by using a televised interview on Fox News, taped from the White House, to promote Ivanka’s merchandise . \nConway’s conduct was met with considerable backlash , prompting a letter from the House oversight committee recommending she be disciplined if necessary. \nThe dust-up over Ivanka’s brand has, in many ways, proved to be an early microcosm of the looming conflict of interest questions surrounding Donald Trump and his family’s empire as he governs from the Oval Office. \nIvanka said she would take a leave of absence from her business when her father was sworn in as president. \n“I will take a formal leave of absence from the Trump Organization and my eponymous apparel and accessories brand,” Ivanka wrote on 11 January. \n“I will no longer be involved with the management or operations of either company.” Donald Trump's criticism of Nordstrom raises ethical concerns, senator says Read more \nBut according to ProPublica , she was still listed as running Trump businesses on at least some active liquor licenses associated with the family’s properties. \nRichard Painter, a White House ethics lawyer under George W Bush, said by acting as a de facto government employee, Ivanka was running the risk of mixing official business with her commercial enterprises. \n“If she wants to sit in as a woman business leader, I guess she can,” Painter said. \n“But she can’t be getting into stuff at the White House that affects her businesses … She better stay an outsider.” \nPainter said the Trump administration’s attack on companies that chose to no longer do business with Ivanka, such as Nordstrom, was the most concerning aspect of the saga. \n“What Kellyanne Conway did was shilling for the Ivanka Trump brand from the White House – she shouldn’t do it,” he said. \n“But much worse is trying to use the force of the government, the power of the government, to intimidate private markets for dissidents who don’t choose to do business with a member of the president’s family.” \n“That’s where the attack on Nordstrom were particularly reprehensible.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:32:06.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
