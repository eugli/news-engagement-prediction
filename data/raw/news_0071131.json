Man, there’s just no stopping Curren$y right now. Only a couple days after releasing his new mixtape Jet Life All-Stars , which served as his 14th project in as many months, the New Orleans rapper announced that he’s turning his focus onto his next solo LP called The Motion Picture Soundtrack , which will be arriving in April. “See u in April,” Curren$y wrote on Instagram Tuesday. “Titling the album #themotionpicturesoundtrack because life is totally a movie… This shall be the perfect score #jlrworking.” However, The Motion Picture Soundtrack isn’t the only thing fans have to look forward to either. The N.O. rapper also has a collaborative EP with Freddie Gibbs on the way called Fetti , AND another project with Big K.R.I.T called Lac N Chevys . It’s unclear which will be arriving first, but we do know The Motion Picture Soundtrack will be coming in April. Check out the announcement (below) and be sure to revisit the newly-released Jet Life All-Stars tape here on HNHH while you’re at it.
