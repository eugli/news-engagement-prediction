Door County | Wisconsin \nCamping at Newport State Park — Photo courtesy of Door County Visitor Bureau \nBordered by 300 miles of shoreline, this gorgeous area is often referred to as the Cape Cod of the Midwest. With homey clapboard cottages lining the waterfront, goats grazing on the roof of Al Johnson’s Swedish Restaurant and the scent of homemade pies bursting with locally-grown Montmorency cherries wafting through the air, Door County is the epitome of hygge. \nSurround yourself with nature, books and fellow curious minds at The Clearing Folk School, treat yourself to a home-brewed draft root beer or a double scoop of ice cream at the iconic Wilson’s, then settle in at the Eagle Harbor Inn, a charming bed and breakfast that raises the standard of both. Whiteface Lodge | New York \nPresidential Suite at Whiteface Lodge — Photo courtesy of Whiteface Lodge \nA modern take on the Adirondack Great Camp, this luxurious all-suite resort tucked away in the snowy peaks of Lake Placid , N.Y. is everything a mountain retreat should be: warm, elegantly rustic and filled with inviting spots to sit with your bae, your buds or a book. \nFireplaces abound in-suite, outside and in the aptly-named Great Room. Handcrafted furnishings made from hand-milled timber keep you in touch with the natural beauty of the area. And, speaking of touch, be sure to indulge in the apple cider masque and massage. Fresh cookies at turndown, nightly s’mores and silky cognac ensure sweet dreams. Lookout Point Lakeside Inn | Arkansas \nLookout Point Lakeside Inn — Photo courtesy of Lookout Point Lakeside Inn \nStaying here is like getting an invitation to stay at your friend's amazing lake house in Hot Springs, Ark. You just look around, grinning and feeling like the luckiest person, as you try out every cushy chair and jump onto the pillow-laden bed. \nThe property is gorgeous, and you can walk around the shore or plop yourself in the swing or a hammock. Common areas are filled with books and board games and, best of all, complimentary snacks and drinks are at your disposal 24/7. You'll never want to leave. \nThe Elk Room at The Osthoff Resort — Photo courtesy of The Osthoff Resort \nDon't fret that you don’t have your own cabin on Elkhart Lake ; this historic resort is happy to be “your place on the lake.” Celebrate the holidays with the sights and smells of its annual Christmas Market, get away for a long summer weekend or simply linger over a fresh-from-the-garden meal at Lola’s on the Lake, named after Osthoff’s hostess with the mostest. \nWhenever you visit, you’ll be drawn into the magnificent Elk Room to grab a coffee, watch the sun set over the lake with a signature cocktail or sink into a sofa with the newspaper. With the relaxing ambiance of a traditional lodge, you’ll feel right at home. Avoca | Ireland \nHandwoven blankets at Avoca — Photo courtesy of Grania Murray, The Irish Collection \nSure, you can buy Avoca wares online but it’s worth a trip to Ireland to spend a day in their stores so you can wrap yourself in all the rich, delicious textures. The Irish version of Anthropologie, this family-run business is best known for its sumptuous blankets and throws, which are handwoven in all-natural fibers including cashmere, mohair and lambswool. \nBring an empty suitcase to also stock up on cardigans, scarves and socks. Although “Avoca” supposedly means “Meeting of the Waters” – a point in Wicklow where the company operates the oldest working mill in Ireland – I’m convinced it’s really Irish for “hygge.” Hermosa Inn | Arizona \nLON's Last Drop, The Hermosa Inn — Photo courtesy of The Hermosa Inn \nIf you don’t think of the desert, with its landscape of prickly cacti, as very hygge, you haven’t yet discovered this secluded boutique luxury hideaway appropriately nestled in Arizona’s Paradise Valley. Built by Lon Megargee, the “dean of cowboy artists,” more than a century ago, this is the place for a great escape. \nEach casita is individually decorated in a warm, Southwestern style, with nature providing its own calming backdrop. The only reason you’ll ever want to leave your room is for the namesake drink at LON’s Last Drop Bar or the Himalayan Salt Seared Ahi Tuna at LON’s Restaurant. Mamsen’s | Viking Ocean Cruises \nHeart-shaped waffles at Mamsen's — Photo courtesy of Viking Ocean Cruises \nThis tiny food station in the Explorer’s Lounge on Viking Ocean Cruises has an almost cult-like following because of its Norwegian comfort food and the family story behind it. “Mamsen” is an affectionate term for mother, and these recipes have all been handed down from Viking Chairman Torstein Hagen’s mom herself. \nYou can taste the love in the made-to-order heart-shaped waffles. A delight for the senses, they’re generously topped with a colorful variety of berries, sour cream and cheese, and are presented on the prettiest plates. Savor each bite along with the breathtaking views. And, yes, Viking even sails to the home of hygge itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:10:45.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
