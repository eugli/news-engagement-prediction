He wrote: 'Allah aided us in conducting 9/11, destroying the capitalist economy, catching you with your pants down, and exposing all the hypocrisy of your long-held claim to democracy and freedom.' Listing many grievances over America's 'brutal and savage massacres' from Vietnam to the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Mohammed focused his rage on the plight of Palestinians and US support for Israel and the 'occupier Jews.' 'Your hands are still wet with the blood of our brothers and sisters and children who were killed in Gaza,' he wrote in the opening paragraph. Defense attorney David Nevin provided a copy of the letter, which has not yet been posted on the US military's website for Guantanamo proceedings. He told AFP that Mohammed began writing it in 2014. The chilling letter is dated January 8, 2015, but only reached the White House in the final days of Obama's presidency Along with the letter, Mohammed sent a 51-page manuscript entitled 'Shall I Die when the Crusaders Carry out the Death Sentence? The Truth about Death.' It was illustrated with an image of a noose. Mohammed, who faces a potential death sentence for allegedly masterminding the plane hijackings, said he was not afraid of dying. 'I speak about death happily!' he wrote. Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times in March 2003 and held at a secret CIA prison site overseas. In the letter, he explained that 'if your court sentences me to life in prison, I will be very happy to be alone in my cell to worship Allah the rest of my life and repent to Him all my sins and misdeeds.' He added: 'And if your court sentences me to death, I will be even happier to meet Allah and the prophets and see my best friends whom you killed unjustly all around the world and to see Sheikh Osama Bin Laden.' Mohammed said God was on the side of the hijackers that fateful day when planes were sent crashing into the Twin Towers in New York Share or comment on this article 378 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:03:04.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
