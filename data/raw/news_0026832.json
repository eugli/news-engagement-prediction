With very few Ola and Uber cabs plying on city roads , people were expected to pay almost twice the regular rate on Tuesday morning due to the high demand. \n“A lot of drivers have stopped driving their cabs – some in solidarity with the agitators, others out of fear. Protestors have been known to damage cars, snatch mobile phones and demand money from drivers who continue to operate despite strikes,” said Ajmer, an Uber driver.

We will get a written commitment from them on Tuesday,” said union vice-president Ravi Rathore. \nOla, however, refused to comment on the issue. \nA handful of drivers have chosen not to participate in the strike because they can’t afford to keep off work, even though they believe that some of the demands being raised – such as increased commission rates – are legitimate. \n“If we keep striking, when will we earn? How will we eat?” asked Raju, a driver who works for both Ola and Uber. \nThey only work in the early hours of the morning or late in the evening to avoid detection by the protestors. As a result, their earnings have taken a hit. “Earlier, I used to work from 4 am to 9 pm and make Rs 3,000-Rs 4,000 a day. Now, due to safety concerns, I drive my vehicle only in the morning. If they damage my car, the extra costs will destroy me. These days, I make anywhere between Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,200,” said Ajmer, another driver.

So I have covered that up, and replaced it with a C,” said an Ola/Uber driver on the condition of anonymity. \nCommuters who do not wish to wait long for their cabs or pay more may have to rely on alternatives like the metro. The Delhi Metro recorded a 6.5% increase in ridership on Monday. DTC buses also witnessed increased ridership in the morning and evening peak hours. \n“The metro recorded a ridership of 23.71 lakh till 8 pm on Monday. On the same day last week, the figure was 22.26 lakh till that time. Lack of cabs could be one of the reasons for the increase,” said a Delhi Metro spokesperson. \nOther options comprise auto rickshaws, traditional kaali-peeli taxis and alternative radio cabs. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:01.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
