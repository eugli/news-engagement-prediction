US President Donald Trump \nThe British parliament is planning to debate the petition on Feb. 20, alongside a counter-petition set up a few days later which argued that Trump should indeed make a state visit to Britain. \nAccording to the British parliament, he is the leader of a free world and the UK is a country that supports free speech and does not believe people opposed to its point of view should be gagged. \nThe government is obliged to respond to any petition which is signed over 10,000 times. \nReport say the date of Trump’s first visit to Britain as president has not yet been finalised.
