The newly blonde bombshell continued her directional approach to style at last night’s Brit Awards after-parties, where she was seen sporting Adam Selman’s new rose-print dress, straight off the Fall runway, with trousers. Loading View on Instagram With the help of stylist Jamie Mizrahi, Perry has been quietly steering her look toward a more high-fashion zone. At last week’s Grammy Awards, she donned two Tom Ford outfits: a heavily embellished top and feathered skirt for the carpet and a suit for the stage .

As for accessories, Perry kept things sculptural with a gold choker and a chunky chain link bracelet. Katy Perry, Caitlyn Jenner, Cindy Crawford, and More Get Groovy at Moschino's L.A.
