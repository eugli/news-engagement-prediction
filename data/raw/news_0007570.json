Almost immediately afterwards, she developed Lyme's tell-tale bulls-eye rash on her leg. A visit to the doctors in South Africa led to just three days worth of antibiotics being provided and no mention of the disease. Lyme disease, which could eventually lead to heart failure, causes her to body to violently rattle - leaving her reliant on a wheelchair Ms Rees, who owned a successful lingerie boutique in London, now lives at her parents home in Warwickshire (pictured on holiday in 2008) She returned home and forgot about the bite and the rash which had faded – until years later when she began to suffer worrying symptoms. She repeatedly felt faint at work and gradually her memory diminished. Headaches became prevalent and fatigue set in. During business meetings, she would mix up people's names and say hello instead of goodbye. My life has changed beyond recognition. I am in a wheelchair. I can't tie my shoelaces Doctors repeatedly said she was suffering from overwork, depression or migraines – which she initially accepted, but gradually began to disbelieve. But in December 2009, her symptoms came to a head when she collapsed at work. Taken to the GP, she subsequently self-referred to a private clinic, where Lyme disease was confirmed. Her lingerie boutique store, Miss Lala's Boudoir in London - which sold to Kate Moss, Scarlett Johansson and Amy Winehouse, was closed down after she fell ill. Ms Rees, recalling the immediate aftermath of the bite, said: 'I had a rash, I visited the doctors, I got treatment. 'I was worried about mosquitoes; malaria was well-known. But not once had I heard of Lyme disease.' Ms Rees said: 'My life has changed beyond recognition. I am in a wheelchair. I can't tie my shoelaces. I've lost the ability to read' Doctors in California have helped ease her symptoms by providing her specialist treatment to combat the bacterial infection She then decided to move back in with her parents in Warwickshire when she became seriously ill in 2010. Last year, she went to California, where she said treatment eased her symptoms including her tremors. Her parents spent thousands of pounds on treatment for her, even selling their home and downsizing. Doctors specialising in the bacterial infection have conducted daily oxygen therapy and blood tests. She also had a port catheter fitted - allowing her to have IV medication administered, alongside her combination of drugs. But even with the expensive, privately-funded treatment, she said her quality of life had been significantly diminished. Despite once having a thriving social life in the city, she has not dated a man in years and spends the majority of her time in bed. Ms Rees is now raising money for more treatment. Donate here .

Lyme disease is caused by a bacteria that is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. The most common symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, fatigue and a skin rash called erythema migrans. The disease can typically be treated by several weeks of oral anitbiotics. But if left untreated, the infection can spread to the joints, heart and nervous symptoms. Lyme disease is diagnosed through the symptoms, physical findings - such as rash - and the likelihood of exposure to infected ticks. To prevent Lyme disease, it is recommended that people use insect repellent, remove ticks promptly, apply pesticides and reduce tick habitat. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE INFECTED?
