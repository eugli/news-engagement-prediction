However, it gets tempting if something good comes up, as it is tough to say no when the money is so good. Doing a reality show also gives you a lot of freedom. We shoot only once a week. I look forward to it for all the fun on the sets. I have to look good and be a judge.” A post shared by @farahkhankunder on Feb 13, 2017 at 5:54am PST \nFarah claims, she does “turn down many TV shows”, as she prefers to get completely involved in any show she takes up. “The connect you make with the audience through a TV show is huge. The love I get from them is amazing. Sometimes, I wonder if people know me more as a TV judge than a director,” she quips, adding, she wants to finish the script of her next film soon. A post shared by @farahkhankunder on Feb 20, 2017 at 1:00pm PST \nFarah judges Indian Idol with music director Anu Malik and singer Sonu Nigam, and lauds their “great chemistry” for the success of the show. “There is a huge amount of nostalgic value for the viewers. Twelve years ago, when we judged the (same) show, people weren’t aware (of reality shows). People have seen that our show is a life changing show. The chemistry between judges and the talent has to be good. Anu, Sonu and I genuinely care for these kids. Nothing is fake on the show and it comes across. I also feel that any reality show works well mostly due to good talent. We all spend a lot of time finding the best singing talent from the country. We heard over 100 contestants in one day and even fought over the ones we wanted to retain.” A post shared by @farahkhankunder on Feb 13, 2017 at 5:12am PST \nTalking about the reaction she got for wearing a sari on the show, farah says, “I was amused [to see the reaction]. I have worn a sari before - at my wedding reception and the premiere of Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012); and I was in the bathroom most of the time handling it. This time I told Manish (Malhotra; fashion designer) to make me a stitched sari, so it stays on. I was surprised that wearing a sari got me such a reaction. Had I worn a swimsuit, I wouldn’t have got such a reception. It was a surprise element perhaps.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:12:33.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
