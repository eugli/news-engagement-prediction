While Ali had been the critics’ champ and won the Screen Actors Guild prize, he lost the Golden Globe (Aaron Taylor-Johnson in “Nocturnal Animals”) and the British Academy prize (Dev Patel in “Lion”) to other contenders. In the end, the “Moonlight” star pulled it out.\nDuring an emotional speech, Ali thanked his “wonderful teachers and professors,” and shared with the audience some advice he received from them: “It’s not about you, it’s about these characters. You are a servant. You’re in service to these stories and these characters.”\nHe also thanked his wife, who just gave birth a few days ago. “I just want to thank her for being a soldier through it all and carrying me through this process,” he said of awards season.\nThe milestone comes after President Donald Trump imposed a ban denying travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries entry into the U.S. The controversial executive order has sparked protests across the country.\nWhile Ali did not bring this up during his speech Sunday night, after he won a SAG Award earlier this year, he proudly declared, “I’m a Muslim.” “Moonlight” is up for several more awards Sunday night, including best picture.\nSlideshow: Oscar winners & highlights\n2017 Academy Awards: Winners and highlights\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://variety.com/t/mahershala-ali/", "http://variety.com/t/oscars/", "http://www.variety.com/"], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:15:53.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
