To date not a single Jew, Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh or other non-Christian has occupied the White House. \nObama has said repeatedly that he is a Christian. \nThat hasn't stopped his most strident critics from raising questions about his faith and fomenting vicious innuendo by claiming falsely that Obama canceled the National Day of Prayer or that he supports the mosque near ground zero . \nThe only qualifications required of presidents by the Constitution are that they be natural-born citizens who are at least 35 years old and have resided in the country for at least 14 years. \nThere's nothing in Constitution disqualifying a Muslim president. \nWhether America is ready for a Muslim president is another story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:18:02.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
