Don't get me wrong, everyone's been really good, but the resources just aren't there to cater for it all,\" she said. \n\"The after-care treatment, especially when you're in remission and these little things that come up, where's the resources to cope with them? They play a significant role in your life.\" Photo: Julie-Anne Shelley suffered from lymphodema after breast cancer surgery, which left her with a swollen armpit. (Supplied: Julie-Anne Shelley) \nComo Physiotherapy managing director Charlene Duncan established the charity's services at her Perth clinic to cater for the increasing number of people diagnosed with cancer. \n\"The increase in demand doesn't match up with how many rehab providers we have around the state,\" Ms Duncan said. \n\"There is an increasing demand and not enough room and not enough facilities, so it's kind of the missing link I suppose, is that step between being discharged from hospital and then going back to normal life. \n\"ECU has a rehab gym for cancer survivors and I think there's soon to be one in Wembley but apart from that there really isn't a lot around privately that people can access.\" Early diagnosis and better treatment methods drives cancer survival \nResearch has revealed the death rate from all cancers had fallen from 209 deaths per 100,000 people in 1982 to an estimated 161 per 100,000 in 2017. \nSurvival rates had also improved, with five-year survival increasing from 48 per cent in 1984-1988 to 68 per cent in 2009-2013. \nMs Duncan said exercise had been proven to help cancer survivors transition back to work faster while reducing the risk of developing other medical conditions. \n\"After being knocked around with chemo and radiotherapy some of their fitness will be gone and getting them back into that transition so they can return to work safely and help with things like fatigue is really important,\" she said. \nOncologist and Australian Medical Association spokesperson Martin Buck agreed the services were critical. \n\"We've probably lagged behind in coming up with this kind of thing,\" he said.

(ABC News: Kathryn Diss) \n\"A lot more patients are now being diagnosed with breast cancer and gynaecological cancers, for example, and these are patients that are now going to return to the workforce, while in the past they might have never got back to work at all. \n\"There are approaches being used in New Zealand, I'm aware of, that seem to be fitting that bill â€” well-structured, well-constructed and effective and we should probably be looking at those programs for both patients in public and private sector,\" he said. \nSo far, Charlene Duncan has failed to gain state government support for funding, forcing her to subsidise all of the treatments to make them affordable for patients. \nDr Martin Buck said it was a program the Government should consider assisting. \n\"It would be a good step forward for the Government because some people might not be financially able to afford to do it themselves, they might not be near a big teaching hospital that provides that service,\" he said. \nIn its latest cancer plan, the State Government identified the need to develop follow-up care once patients had finished treatment. \nIt said it was making progress and will make the issue a priority in its next cancer plan, which was being developed under consultation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:11:43.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
