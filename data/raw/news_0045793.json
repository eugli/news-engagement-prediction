They have allowed me to carry conservative and libertarian ideas to communities that would otherwise never have heard them. \n“They have been a significant factor in my success. I’m grateful for that freedom and for the friendships I forged there. \n“I would be wrong to allow my poor choice of words to detract from my colleagues’ important reporting, so today I am resigning from Breitbart, effective immediately. This decision is mine alone.” Milo Yiannopoulos on Steve Bannon in Channel 4 News interview \nHe added: “When your friends have done right by you, you do right by them. For me, now, that means stepping aside so my colleagues at Breitbart can get back to the great work they do.” \nMr Yiannopoulos joined the news company in 2014 under Steve Bannon – the then chairman who went on to be appointed President Trump’s senior advisor. \nHis comments on child abuse were made during an interview on podcast site The Drunken Peasants”. Presidential aide: Stephen Bannon hired Milo for Breitbart (REUTERS) \nDuring the conversation, he joked about a sexual encounter he had with a Catholic priest as a teenager and said: “You’re misunderstanding what pedophilia means. \n“Paedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old who is sexually mature. Paedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty.” \nHe added that consent by minors is “arbitrary and oppressive.” \nHe defended his comments in a statement released on his Facebook page over the weekend, writing: “I do not support paedophilia. Period. Milo Yiannopoulos challenged on Breitbart News headlines about Muslims and feminism on Channel 4 News \n“It is a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst. There are selectively edited videos doing the rounds, as part of a coordinated effort to discredit me from establishment Republicans, that suggest I am soft on the subject. Donald Trump to rip-up Obama's pollution safeguards \n“I’m partly to blame. My own experiences as a victim led me to believe I could say anything I wanted to on this subject, no matter how outrageous. \n“But I understand that my usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humour might have come across as flippancy, a lack of care for other victims or, worse, ‘advocacy.’ I deeply regret that.” \nA Breitbart News company statement released after the press conference said: “Milo Yiannopoulos’s bold voice has sparked much-needed debate on important cultural topics confronting universities, the LGBTQ community, the press, and the tech industry. \n“Milo notified us this morning of his decision to resign as editor of Breitbart Tech and we accepted his resignation.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:18:59.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
