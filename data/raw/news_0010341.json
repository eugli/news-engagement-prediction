The process also often can cost around $2,000 , mostly for an attorney's help to navigate the process. \nBut the online program provides users with in-depth screening, information and referrals to legal aid organizations. \nFirst, users answer a series of simple questions about their background and family history. They are then provided with a set of results based on their answers that lets them know if they might be eligible for relief, said immi creator Matthew Burnett. The program also provides referrals to non-profit legal organizations for free or low-cost help. \nThe website also has a learning center where users can read up on U.S. immigration, learn basic terms and concepts, and understand the different ways there are to stay in the U.S. legally. \nMany immigrants are feeling threatened as a result of President Donald Trump's immigration executive orders, including one that called for the immediate construction of a wall on the southern border.
