Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting,\" Trump tweeted . \nTrump notably won the presidential election despite many professional polls predicting a decisive Hillary Clinton victory. \nA recent CNN poll found that Trump has the lowest approval rating in recent history for a new president, with a 53 per cent majority said they disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job. READ MORE: * Trump a headache for NZ spies? \nJust 44 per cent approve of the job he's doing two weeks into his presidency, according to the poll, seven points below the previous low for presidents measured in the survey. Trump is the only president in recent history to hold a net-negative rating at this point in his tenure. \nAdditionally, polls have found that Trump's actions aimed at national security have not been well received by Americans: \n* 53 per cent oppose the executive order Trump signed that temporarily bans travel to the US for citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries. \n* 46 per cent, a plurality, believe it makes the US \"less safe\" from terrorism. \n* A majority, 55 per cent, view it as \"an attempt to ban Muslims\" from entering the US. \nIn mid-January, before his inauguration, the then-president-elect dismissed his low approval ratings as \"rigged\". \nThe president also said he uses data to \"call my own shots\" and accused what he termed the \"fake news media\" of lying in a separate tweet Monday morning. \n\"I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some fake news media, in order to marginalize, lies!,\" Trump tweeted . Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election.
