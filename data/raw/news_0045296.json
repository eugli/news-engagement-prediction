Slot to Kentucky Links ESPN analyst Seth Greenberg said Sunday that Kentucky sophomore Isaiah Briscoe needs to get back to what he does well. \nIsiah Briscoe needs to get back to what makes him different. Be a great defender, slasher and secondary rebounder.

But he struggled at Georgia, shooting 4-of-12 with five fouls and four turnovers. And his outside shot hasn’t been falling of late, with Briscoe making just 1 of his last 12 three-pointers. When Briscoe’s at his best, he’s an outstanding complementary player, as someone who’s nearly impossible to keep out of the lane, and he can be among the SEC’s best defenders.
