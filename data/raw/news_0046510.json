IndiaToday.in | Edited by Sanjana Agnihotri A + A - Photo: PTI \nA drunk woman's yes for sexual intercourse is actually a 'no' and the consent is 'not valid', ruled Bombay high court. \n\"A woman, when intoxicated, is incapable of giving a free and conscious consent to a sexual relationship\", held the Bombay high court. \nJustice Mridula Bhatkar, while hearing bail applications filed by three men from Pune, accused of gangrape, kidnapping and abduction of a 24-year-old woman, held that the phrase \"without her consent\" has a wider meaning. \nThe court observed that for sex to be consensual, the woman must be in her right senses and unambiguously say 'yes'. Moreover, \"silence, or uncertainty\" in itself cannot demonstrate consent. \n\"Not every 'Yes' is covered as valid consent defined under section 375 of the Indian Penal Code\", said justice Bhatkar. \nThe court said when a woman says 'no' to sexual intercourse it means she is unwilling and when she says yes, it must be free and unambiguous for the incident not to be considered rape. \nThe 24-year-old woman denied having alcohol knowingly and claimed that the petitioner had spiked her drinks. However, the petitioner argued that she had four servings of a cocktail after which he took her to his flat because she lost consciousness. \nThe youngsters in India who are financially independent often have free interaction and drinks together, as claimed by counsel for the accused, Aabad Ponda.
