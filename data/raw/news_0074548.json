It was the culmination of an eight-year narrative that saw the actress come close in the same category in 2009 for Doubt , and even closer in the leading actress category in 2011 for The Help . But ever since Paramount and Davis made a strategic move last fall to submit the actress’s leading Fences performance in the supporting category, Davis’s win for Fences has felt like a foregone conclusion . She has since won every major award in that category, and Sunday’s Oscar feels like a much-deserved crowning achievement. As triumphant a win as this is for Davis, though, it’s also a somewhat bittersweet victory. Davis made history this year as the only non-white actress to ever be nominated three times for an Oscar, but Halle Berry still holds the historical distinction of being the only non-white actress ever to win in the lead category—and many Oscar experts wonder if Davis could have joined her this year. Despite the wealth of talent in the supporting actress category from Davis’s competition, including Michelle Williams ( Manchester By The Sea ), Naomie Harris ( Moonlight ), and previous Oscar winners Octavia Spencer ( Hidden Figures ) and Nicole Kidman ( Lion ), Davis was competing against women who had much, much less screen time than she gets in Fences . Going by minutes on camera alone, Davis had significantly more chances to make an impact on voters, and a wider window to show her range . But there’s no ignoring the fact that Davis won the best lead actress Tony for playing this same role in a 2010 stage production of Fences . Could she have beaten best actress favorite Emma Stone to take home the top acting prize this year? It’s understandable why Davis might have wanted to take the more secure road to Oscar glory this year. Her loss in 2011 to her fried Meryl Streep in the lead acting category was considered something of a dramatic upset . That potential disappointment may have been compounded by the fact that Davis had to watch her friend (and The Help co-star) Spencer take home the Oscar the same year in the supporting category. That category—for better or worse—has historically been the friendliest to non-white performers—6 out of 15 (40 percent) of the Oscars’s non-white winning actors have been supporting actresses. That percentage underlines Oscar’s tendency to reward women of color for playing characters whose role is to literally support or bolster someone else, be they maids or slaves . But Davis played neither a maid nor a slave in Fences . As Davis said about her character Rose on the Oscars red carpet Sunday evening, “You think she’s going to be in the background, and then she surprises you.” The dignified, emotionally gut-wrenching stand Davis took against her cinematic husband Denzel Washington could conceivably have won out against Emma Stone’s appealing but, ultimately, lighter turn in La La Land . Davis’s win feels very much like an “at last” moment for a long-deserving performer, but one can’t help but wonder if it could have been more.
