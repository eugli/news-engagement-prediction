ADVERTISEMENT \nThe high court also prohibited the respondents from entering within a radius of one kilometer from the petitioner’s residence and work. \nThe case is also remanded to the Court of Appeals for a hearing and the respondents were given five working days to make a verified return. \nThe appeals court has been given 10 days after the hearing to issue a ruling. \nChristina Macandog, in her petition, claimed that she and her husband “were induced by respondent police officers to deal in drugs but that they decided, in mid-2016, to surrender and reform but that, before they could do the same, Cadag and Canilon threatened to kill them.” \nMacandog said because of the threat, she has gone into hiding since then, leaving her child behind for fear that she will be killed next. \nLast January, the high court issued the first writ of amparo and protection order to a survivor and relatives of victims of a tokhang operation in Payatas, Quezon City. The appeals court already conducted a hearing and ordered the transfer of the police officers involved to an area outside Quezon City and Rizal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:59:02.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
