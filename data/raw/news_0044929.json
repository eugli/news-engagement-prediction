The vessel can host up to 45 people who power it with their exercise on spinning bikes and cross trainers (pictured) Augmented-reality screens installed on the boat will show passengers both the quantity of energy sourced from the workout, and data about the Seine's environmental conditions 'It provides one with a tangible experience of what lies behind the often abstract notion of electric power.' The vessel's current design pays tribute to the symbolic Bateaux Mouches, the traditional ferry-boats that have been carrying tourists on the Seine since the early 20th century. Mr Ratti added: 'Strolling has always been a quintessentially Parisian way to express the excitement of urban life. What if tomorrow we can start to stroll on the river itself?' The innovative design (pictured), was developed by Italian firm Carlo Ratti Associati, and once ordered, can be implemented for real in less than 18 months His firm collaborated with New York-based non-profit architecture group Terreform ONE on the plans. The group's co-founder Mitchell Joachim described it as a very 'doable project' with the potential to have a positive impact on city life - but no word yet on when it might become a reality. 'It is still in progress, currently at a concept stage,' a Carlo Ratti Associati spokesperson told MailOnline Travel. 'We hope to set sail soon â€“ in Paris, but also in other cities.'
