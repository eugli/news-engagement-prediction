This came to light following a recently concluded investigation commissioned by the academy. \nIn a letter sent out to the Milton community on Tuesday, school officials said that a nine-month investigation by a New York security firm it hired yielded the shocking findings – the lecturer sexually abused at least 12 male students, all minors at the time. \nThree other former employees, who were not named in the letter, were also found to have engaged in similar misconduct. \nThe lecturer was sacked in 1987 after admitting to molesting a student, but the extent of his crimes is only coming to light now following the investigation. The probe was launched following a 2016 news report on sexual misconduct in US private schools. \nThe report prompted a fact-finding mission on whether any transgressions had occurred in the past. \nThey hired T&M Protection Resources, a private consulting firm, to conduct the investigation that began in May 2016. \nThe firm discovered that the school’s management at the time had allowed the lecturer to continue working despite being aware of his misconduct. \nThe letter mentioned that then headmaster of Milton Academy Jerome A. Pieh, “had some knowledge” of his misconduct in 1982, “but allowed him to continue working there for five more years before he was sacked in 1987”. \nSince then, he has worked in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia and is well-known in the theatre and performing arts scene. \nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, he has worked as a theatre director, acting coach and performing arts educator for nearly 30 years in South-East Asia. \nMilton Academy’s board of trustees on Tuesday expressed “deep regret” for not protecting its students all those years ago, and failing to investigate him at the time. \n“On behalf of Milton Academy and its board of trustees, we want to acknowledge and deeply apologise for those failures,” said the current head of school Todd Bland, and board of trustees president Lisa Donohue. \nThe academy also said that it has contacted Immigration authorities about the findings of its investigation as well as the employers he worked for after leaving the school. These, apparently, number about 18 schools and theatre organisations.
