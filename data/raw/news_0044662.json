Grace Mugabe has defended her husband against critics who say it is time for him to step down, saying the ruling party should field him as a corpse if he dies before elections next year.\nIn an interview marking his birthday that was shown late Monday on state broadcaster ZBC, Mugabe noted that his wife's remarks were shown on television.\n\"Fireworks, isn't it?\" he said to the interviewer, laughing.\nGrace Mugabe's political rise has been a source of consternation for opposition figures as well as some officials within the ruling ZANU-PF party who suspect she is positioning herself for an even more powerful role in the government. The president described her as \"very much accepted by the people\" and said the women's wing of the ruling ZANU-PF party had chosen his wife as its head because of her political ambitions.\nHe described her as \"well-seasoned\" and \"a very strong character.\"\nMugabe also repeated his pledge to stand in elections in 2018 despite calls from some Zimbabweans for him to quit amid economic turmoil in the once-prosperous country and numerous allegations about human rights and election irregularities. The president said he was still popular and nobody is qualified to replace him.\n\"The volume of wishes for the president to stand, the number of people who will be disappointed is galore and I don't want to disappoint them,\" he said.\nDuring the interview , Mugabe often gestured to emphasize points. He spoke slowly and was slumped into a leather armchair for the most of the interview.\n  Zimbabwe's Mugabe turns 93, says he will stand in 2018 polls  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:39:08.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
