It began with a strong desire to help my children with their various sicknesses and that was how it started for me. I had been going to see someone for my health problem, she does hair analysis along with homeopathic remedies . I told her how helpless I felt about not being able to help my young children, and because she knew me and my history, she told me she knew I could do hands-on-healing. White Light Protection \nFirst she gave me something to say before I started, to protection myself and to channel the white light, and then she told me to position my hands above the problem area.I begin by kneeling next to the person laying down on the floor and hold my hands upwards with my first finger and thumb touching each other. I take 3 deep breaths to get myself focused on what I am going to do. At that point I begin to feel the energy flowing through my hands and body. For some reason the kneeling position creates the strongest energy for me, not that I can't do it any position, but I believe in the kneeling position all your chakra’s are aligned. Inviting Spirit Helpers \nI picture a white light swirling around me starting from my feet and going up to my head. I say to myself \"Divine Light of the Highest Order under the Protection of Archangel Michael\" 3 times. It brings in the \"good light\" and Archangel Michael to protect you. I invite my spirit guides and guardian angels into the session, and then I invite the persons spirit guides and guardian angels into the healing session (I say it just that simply). Energetically Sensing Auric Field \nI work on the aura level , which means that I can sense with my hands, where the energy field is a few inches above the person’s body. I start by passing my hands over the body several times (sweeping motion), starting from the head and moving to the feet. I believe this smoothes out the aura, and relaxes the person who is being worked on.I then begin by placing my hands above the head and slowly move towards the person's feet, making only one pass of the hands. I will stop only when my hands \"feel\" a spot where there is energy. I stay in that spot until I feel like it has \"cleared\" or that I get the feeling that I am done for now. When I get the sensation that the energy spot or chakra has \"cleared\" it's almost as if a breeze has blown between my hands and the person. Other times, the energy spot or chakra may not be \"cleared\" but I get the feeling that that is enough for now and move on. You don't want to \"push\" the person beyond what they are capable of handling. I end at the soles of the feet.Sometimes I get a pulsing sensation going between my two hands, sometimes it is just a warm sensation, other times, the energy feels \"stuck\" and so I will move my hands in a circular motion above the area to get the energy moving and then will stop and hold my hands still again. I am also able to \"see\" things sometimes when working on people and ask for their permission to tell them what I see. Sweeping the Aura \nWhen I am done with the one pass of my hands-on-healing from head to toe, I will go back to the head and brush down the aura a few inches above the body by using a sweeping motion towards to feet, approximately 3 times picturing a white protection light as I finish. Energy Healing's Learning Curve \nIn the beginning, I did not have anyone to help me, so I read a few books, one of them is Healing with Gemstones and Crystals written by Diane Stein. I learned to use healing crystals for a layout along with the hands-on-healing. What the book could not tell me, I had to learn by doing. Fortunately there were a few enlightened souls who could tell me what I was doing wrong and who could help correct themselves. One the first two people who let me do a hands-on-healing I made 3 passes over the body, and that was just too much energy for them to handle, it opened up the energy or chakra spot too much. At first I would also \"push the energy\" instead of letting myself be the vessel and let the energy flow, and that is not a good thing to do either.It is still sometimes hard for me to totally protect myself enough so I don't \"take in\" their energy. I try to make a mental note before I start that I will not take on this person’s feelings or energy, to sort of disassociate myself from what is going to take place. I will usually let cold water wash over my hands when I am done or let my hands go through dry sea salt to get the \"energy\" out of my hands.I have been doing this for about 10 years, and I feel I must have done this in another life, because it came to me so naturally. The people I work on tell me they feel very relaxed afterwards, but I know that something more has happened.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:28:44.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
