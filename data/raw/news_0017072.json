By: Trends Desk | New Delhi | Published:February 6, 2017 2:22 pm The rapper-activist declares democracy dead in Tamil Nadu. Here’s why. (Source: Sofia Thenmozhi Ashraf/Facebook) \nTamil Nadu politics has been in a state of constant flux ever since former CM and AIADMK chief J Jayalithaa’s death in December 2016. Now, with her long-time companion VK Sasikala taking over as the Chief Minister of the the state soon, there have been many voices of dissent against the move.

The social media space has been full of comments condemning the 62-year-old politician and questioning her ability to run the state. Among those who have disagreed with Sasikala’s next move is Tamil rapper and activist Sofia Thenmozhi Ashraf, known best for her song ‘Kodaikanal Won’t’. \nAshraf took to Facebook protesting Sasikala’s appointment. \nAccording to a report by The News Minute, Ashraf said the lyrics of the song echoed the sentiment of many Tamilians that the ones who aren’t elected cannot become ministers. She said that democracy is dead if people proclaim their leadership without contesting elections — as is supposed to be in a democracy. As the video begins, this is what Ashraf says: “We are extremely disturbed by what’s happening in Chennai right now. Democracy has taken a huge hit. And here’s what we think about it.” \nALSO READ | WATCH: Is there good news?

They sing how the politicians make false promises and go by, while the people continue to suffer. At one point they blatantly declare in their song — ‘Ministers who have not been appointed through elections, are not welcome.’ \nThis is a rough translation of the song, as translated by the Web-zine. \n‘Looters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:02:14.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
