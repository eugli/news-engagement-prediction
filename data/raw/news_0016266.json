The decline was even more pronounced in Osaka, where the average tumbled 26% to 10,193 yen. \nWhile room rates rose more than 10% nationwide in 2015, many hotels cut prices last year. The Lunar New Year -- typically a busy time for the industry, since many Chinese use the long break for travel -- was closely watched this time for signs of what to expect in the coming year. \n\"The impact of minpaku was larger than we thought,\" an officer at Kintetsu Miyako Hotels International said, referring to paid hosting of travelers at private residences. A survey by the Osaka Convention and Tourism Bureau found that 57% of foreign visitors to the city stay in hotels, while 17% use minpaku. Private-lodging rentals are an attractive option for groups, allowing them to pack more people into fewer rooms. \nPrice cuts helped many hotels boost or maintain occupancy rates over the holiday. The Hotel New Hankyu Osaka cut prices by nearly 20% and the ANA Crowne Plaza Osaka by almost 10%. \nThe Hotel New Otani in Tokyo lowered average rates for individual foreign guests by about 10% to 21,000 yen per night, changing its strategy after failing to draw as many customers as hoped the previous year with more-bullish pricing. The hotel's occupancy rate rose 0.7 percentage point to 64%. \nThe popular home-sharing website Airbnb has more than 16,000 listings in Tokyo and more than 12,000 in Osaka Prefecture, a Tokyo-based minpaku analysis firm said. Tujia, called China's answer to Airbnb, has announced plans to expand into Japan. Hotels will need to adapt further to this influx of supply. \n(Nikkei)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:09:13.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
