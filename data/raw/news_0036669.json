This was a good advice 70 years ago and is still a good advice today. It is important to stay true to yourself, be special for someone in particular, work hard, aim high, never stop learning and never give up. The words were even echoed by Apple founder Steve Jobs who also opined that time is limited so don't waste your time living someone else's life.\" \n\nIslam, who was delivering the centennial lecture on 'Lessons from and for the journey' at Institute of Agricultural Sciences , Banaras Hindu University (BHU) on Friday, called the students 'hope of tomorrow' and exhorted them not to model themselves on the path led by him or adopt his perspectives but create their own path and make their own journey. \n\n\"If somebody asked me four decades ago if I would make it big or be successful, my answer would be no. But, I worked hard, aimed high and tried to get higher education which are the keys to success. I see in you the future of India and heart and soul of this nation. I want you all to be the best you can be, exploit your fullest potential, become leader of GenNext, learn new things and reinvent yourself and never forget your roots,\" he said. Quoting former US president Barack Obama, he stressed on importance of quality education and termed it as an equalizer and opportunity creator. Obama said that education will be the currency of 21st century and it indeed is a powerful tool of cultivating creativity, compassion and making the economic ladder strong, Islam recalled. \n\nHighlighting the vision of BHU founder Madan Mohan Malaviya and drawing an analogy between his alma mater Aligarh Muslim University and BHU, Islam said, \"This university is a timeless treasure and its founder helped shape India through his far-fetched vision. I wasn't fortunate enough to attend BHU but studied at AMU, both of whose founders were great visionaries and ahead of their times. Although both universities have difference in faiths but share a common ground. Islam, who recently dedicated a new management school worth $2 million at AMU, said that BHU was also an educational empowerment zone for all its students. The charitable work that I do is not charity but investment in creating the next generation of leaders and entrepreneurs, he said and also recalled his visit to India with his wife Debbie along with Obama about two years ago. \n\nIslam was all praises for US for its inclusiveness and termed it as a land of opportunity. In reply to a question from a BHU student about the turning point in his life, Islam said, \"Being someone with a dark skin and then trying to integrate the two countries was indeed challenging. Coming to US and then being confronted with hostility and prejudice was daunting but it became my strength and courage as I felt when other US students can do something, I can do it too. While success taught me how to go forward and progress, failure taught me to never go back,\" he said. \n\nWhen asked about inequality in world economy, Islam admitted to the rising income equality and gap between rich and the poor and said that it is heartbreaking to see people who can't make a living and have to struggle every day. India has all the possibilities in an ocean of poverty. One of the reasons for Trump's election victory in US was that he had a message for these people in his agenda unlike his opponent Hillary Clinton who lost around 3,50,000 votes. Islam was also part of campaigning for Clinton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:59:24.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
