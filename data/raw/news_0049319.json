I didn't think he would reply but he did and said 'Thank you gorgeous' which was really nice. \n\"We started talking and got on really well. \n\"One day he was back in Redcar and he came round to my house. \n\"He was wearing tartan pyjamas and he had a spliff with which was a bit odd. \n\"But we went for a drive in his car, one thing led to another and we had sex. \n\"Everything was cool between us after and we kept chatting on Facebook. The plan was that he would get in touch with me whenever he was back home and if we were both single we would meet up. \n\"But it never happened because Chris found the messages on my phone. \n\"We were trying to make a go of it again but it was still very on-off. \n\"He was really angry when he saw the messages. Most of his anger was directed at James rather than me, he was jealous of him because James is famous. \n\"He sent him a message saying he was going to blow up his mother's house. \n\"James and I stopped talking after that. He didn't want anything to do with me if me ex was threatening him which was understandable. \n\"I tried to pull away from Chris and started seeing him him less and less but he kept causing trouble. \n\"He came to the bar where I worked and caused problems. It was awful but bit by bit it improved and by last summer we were civil with each other.\" Facebook Revell smashed a pint glass over Arthur’s head and punched him from behind Facebook 12 Revell attacked the star while he was out with pals last August in Redcar, North Yorks \nGemma said: \"On the night of the attack all three of us were in the same pub but with different groups of friends. \n\"I was outside having a cigarette when I saw James. I said hello and asked if he remembered me. \n\"He said he did and we had a nice chat. \n\"I then asked him if I could have a picture with him and he said yes. \n\"We went back inside after that and went back to our own friends. \n\"Chris arrived in the bar shortly after and was stood near me. \n\"The next thing I knew James walked past and Chris noticed him and said: 'Is that James Arthur?' \n\"Chris got up and ran after him. I tried to grab his arm said leave it but he pulled away and ran through the crowd. \n\"I didn't see what actually happened. I thought he might be going up to argue with him or perhaps punch him. I never dreamed he would do what he did. \n\"Then Chris ran out shouting that it was my fault and someone said James had been glassed. We left and went home because we didn't know what to do. \n\"I felt horrible. It made me feel so bad. I couldn't believe he had actually gone that far especially in a public place and knowing who James was. It was so stupid.\" 12 James Arthur revealed how the attack left him fearing for the future of his career \nGemma said: \"When Chris got a long sentence I was relieved that I wouldn't have to have anything to do with him for a while. \n\"But he is still bothering me from behind bars. \n\"He has written about 20 letters since he was put on remand. \n\"I replied to the first one but haven't replied to any others. The first one was nice and was pleading to get back together. \n\"But later ones got nastier when he realised that wasn't going to happen. \n\"I have not reported his threats to the police because I know I will just get more trouble off his friends. I can't win no matter what I do. \n\"I just want to get on with my life now. Me and James are fine but we don't speak anymore. He's got his life and I've got mine. \n\"I would like to say sorry once more to him. None of this was anyone's fault but Chris's but I am sorry that James got hurt just because of a one night stand. \n\"I am engaged now to a great bloke and I want to put all this behind me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:18:23.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
