What has also been released today? \nTwo other reports that looked into the deaths of Queensland children also came out. \nOne found 390 children died during 2015-16, with disease and medical conditions the leading cause of death. Forty-six of the deceased were known to the child protection system. \nThe other annual report was on child death case reviews. What is still to come?

(Facebook: Emmy Louise) \nThere are still several reviews to be handed down. \nThe QFCC is reviewing the death of Mason Jet Lee, a toddler who suffered fatal injuries and was found at his Caboolture home last year. Five people have been charged over the death. \nKPMG and a former director-general, Linda Apelt, are reviewing Queensland's child safety procedures and practices. \nMeanwhile, an expert panel including Bravehearts founder Hetty Johnson and Foster Care Queensland CEO Bryan Smith is examining the state's Blue Card and foster care systems. \nAnother review will look at operations conducted by the QFCC's Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect Team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:57:08.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
