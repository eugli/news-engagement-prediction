We were aware of the issue. It seems to be the fashion at the moment,\" said Sgt. Cam Donnison. \"They are taking these items to hock off for methamphetamine â€” it's all meth driven.\" \nApparently even large potted plant can catch fetch $215 for someone needing to fuel a meth habit. I am the one who gnocks.
