Turns out, Kaushal too occasionally goes on a streak of busting out hilarious one-liners on Twitter - when he's in the mood. And he was recently very much in the mood. Someone asked Kaushal, who's a Supreme Court advocate and a former Mizoram governor, why he doesn't follow his wife, Swaraj on Twitter. His reply was fabulous. — Governor Swaraj (@governorswaraj) February 17, 2017 Kaushal's answer was referring to the fact that his wife, as external affairs minister, comes to the aid of Indians stranded abroad so many times, that one has lost count. So active is Swaraj on Twitter that if she's MIA for even a day, people begin to wonder if all's well. Like this person who recently reached out to Swaraj's husband, asking if the minister was okay because she hadn't tweeted that day. @governorswaraj sir with great respect to u, just curious if all well. @SushmaSwaraj mam has not been active on twitter today. Hope all fine https://t.co/WoEgjTorCB — LAKSHYA ADVANI? (@imLakshyaAdvani) February 14, 2017 Sure enough, Kaushal replied, again with his deadpan humour. If she is not tweeting, then all is well. https://t.co/TJEMSx6jAE — Governor Swaraj (@governorswaraj) February 14, 2017 Last year, minister Swaraj tweeted a picture of her and her husband holding hands, after she bumped into him in Parliament. Together after many years - a chance meeting with @governorswaraj at the Parliament House gate today. /1 pic.twitter.com/yHvD0NliSt — Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) August 11, 2016 Before that, she posted a romantic photograph of herself with Kaushal on their wedding day. Thanks for your greetings and good wishes on our wedding anniversary. @sushmaswaraj & @GovernorSwaraj pic.twitter.com/d80OTAiMjc — Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) July 13, 2016 All of this probably made several people curious, like this one gentleman who tweeted Kaushal asking if he and Swaraj had had an 'arranged marriage.' Kaushal's reply was all class and humour. He wanted to shield his privacy but didn't want to be rude and not reply. So this is what he said: What is the warranty period for each ? https://t.co/6aQ4VdG2LG — Governor Swaraj (@governorswaraj) February 15, 2017 In a similar vein, someone asked Kaushal recently when he'd last met his wife. His reply? Are you an RTI activist ? https://t.co/sI8cZf40ya — Governor Swaraj (@governorswaraj) February 16, 2017 This repartee delighted Swaraj's followers. One of them tweeted: \"Must say! Both you and @SushmaSwaraj Ji have a great sense of humor. Must b lot of fun to be around you both\". Kaushal's reply to that was both modest and a teeny bit romantic too. The comedy is on for 42 years now. https://t.co/VAaqULqN5Y — Governor Swaraj (@governorswaraj) February 16, 2017 For those who want to do some detecting, here's a hint about what kind of marriage the power couple had. Last year, when somebody asked minister Swaraj why she doesn't follower her husband on Twitter, Kaushal jumped in to reply. \"I have followed her for 45 years - Can't change things now.\" Married for 42 years but following Sushma Swaraj for 45?
