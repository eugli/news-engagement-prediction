The country said it created a nuclear weapon in just a few years without any external aid.\nIf it successfully created a fully functional inter-continental ballistic missile, it could conceivably threaten the United States - about 9,000 km (5,500 miles) away - as well as closer neighbours.\nBut the government remains defiant in the face of international pressure.\n\"It is utterly childish to think that [North Korea] would not manufacture nuclear weapons and inter-continental ballistic rockets if a few [pennies] of money is cut off,\" it said in its statement.\nNorth Korea's nuclear programme: How advanced is it? Trump derides North Korea missile claim US warns N Korea against nuclear attack The words \"dancing to the tune of the US\" may refer to President Donald Trump's remarks, before taking office, that China should bring North Korea \"under control\".\n\"China has… total control over North Korea,\" he said in an interview with Fox and Friends on 4 January.\n\"And China should solve that problem. And if they don't solve the problem, we should make trade very difficult for China.\"\nThe rebuke of its only ally is the second verbal attack on another nation by North Korea on the same day.\nEarlier, it appeared to blame Malaysia for the death of Kim Jong-nam , the half-brother of North Korea's leader, and said the country was attempting to politicise the return of his body.\nMr Kim died after being poisoned at Kuala Lumpur airport in an apparent planned attack.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-39015529", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11813699", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-39060604", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/16CBB/production/_94817339_gettyimages-160953163.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3823/production/_94817341_gettyimages-158410560.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-23T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:20:45.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
