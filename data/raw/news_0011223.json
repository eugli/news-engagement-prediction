The reason for this renewed investor optimism is the promise of more stimulus in the US. \nSpecifically, President Trump said he would be announcing “something phenomenal in terms of tax” over “the next two or three weeks. ” \nVague, but enough to boost investors hooked on stimulus, as CMC Markets’ Michael Hewson explains: \nThe move to new record highs in equity markets and surge in the US dollar are symptomatic of a market craving a new stimulus. The risk is that as with most oases they turn out to be an illusion, and given the new President’s propensity for melodrama the risk is that this could well be no different. \nIt is hard to imagine that he will be able to promise anything tangible within a two to three week window, however whatever the realities investors appear happy to take him at his word, as US markets closed well above their previous peaks, while the US dollar index looks set to post its first positive week this year. \nInvestors might also be comforted by the more conciliatory note struck by the President with China, following his first conversation with President Xi Jinping since taking office. \nIn Asia, the Nikkei was up 2.5%, the Hang Seng up 0.4% and the Topix up 2.2% and the Shanghai Composite up 0.4%. \nEuropean markets are also expected to open higher: IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) Our European opening calls: $FTSE 7256 +0.37%$DAX 11690 +0.40% ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T10:07:19.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
