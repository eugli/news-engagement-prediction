Padilla Designs, a custom sculpture and metal fabrication company responsible for creating elaborate metal gates for Hawaii hotels and luxury homes, has come full circle since its start in 1972. Larry Padilla of Padilla Designs Courtesy Padilla Designs One of Padilla’s first contracted works was for the first International Market Place, and a few months ago he completed a $1 million fire chandelier installation for the entrance to the renovated outdoor mall. Other works include the Maui demigod sculpture at the Andaz Wailea, and metal fabrication works for Whaler’s Village as part of its renovation. Padilla Designs, one of Pacific Business News’ 50 fastest-growing companies last year, is now a family business, with Padilla’s four sons overseeing the business. How did you get started? I came to Hawaii from Vietnam, and knew when I pulled into the harbor and saw the beautiful Island I wanted to come back. When I moved to Maui in 1970 I ran into a friend who was creating interesting sculptures and talked me into making some of my own. Although I had a degree in computer programming, I had always been creative and I was a painter. When I was on my way to a local jeweler to sell one of my first sculptures, a tourist stopped me and bought it. I knew then that this could be something. Did you always know you wanted to be an entrepreneur? My dream was never to own a company, but to follow what makes me happy and feel good about the work I am doing. I have always wanted to create positive energy, and from the beginning, this work came naturally to me. I always tell people that life is short, so do what you want to do and don’t worry about money. How did your children get involved in the business? My wife and I homeschooled our five kids, and I taught them my trade as part of their education. It was something that I wanted them to learn so they could always make a living, but it wasn’t something they had to do if they didn’t want to. My boys have been a big part of the business and two of my sons, Kaleo and Jamis, have really led the company with recent projects. My daughter is part of the business but it’s not really what she wants to do. What does the process look like for a project? I do a lot of work with custom homes, and we are involved with those projects from the beginning, when the homes are still in the design phase. If you are building a multi-million-dollar home, you want the gate and entrance to flow with the home and work together. I recently built a gate for a Kauai home for $100,000, and the client was very happy because I worked with them from the beginning to create something unique and special. How do you market your company? We do some advertising in luxury home magazines because that is a big part of our clientele, people looking to build or remodel a luxury home. We also get a lot of business through word of mouth referrals and recommendations from friends, either for commercial or residential properties. Through hard work and our designs, we have become pretty well known on the Island. What is the hardest part about owning a business? You are always working, there are no days off. But I wouldn’t say it is hard because I am not the kind of person to get stressed, and I make sure my mornings are peaceful so my day goes smoothly. I love what I do, and I am always trying to make sure I stay on top of my game and improve with every project. What is the biggest reward? Designing something creative and unique that nobody else is doing and seeing the satisfaction in the client, and the esteem I get from friends and people I work with. It is also special to be able to work with my family and see my boys work together and play together. People are amazed with how well they get along, they have never had any problem and it is a joy to watch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:54:27.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
