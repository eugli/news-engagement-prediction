The 10-year-old victim*, a fourth grade student at a government school in a village near Rawal Lake, had allegedly been raped by the suspect* as she was walking back from the school on Wednesday afternoon. \nIn her statement to the police, the girl said that she had taken a shortcut on an unpaved trail through woods. \nHowever, a man who was shepherding buffalos nearby, grabbed her and took her to the jungle where he raped her. \nThe victim said that after the sexual assault, she ran towards the road screaming while the suspect disappeared into the jungle. However, after the incident was reported to the Bani Gala police on Wednesday, police managed to apprehend the suspect. \nPolice said they had lodged the FIR based on the girlâ€™s statement and launched an investigation. However, results of a medical examination of the victim were still awaited. \nMeanwhile, an officer told The Express Tribune that an initial examination by the doctors did not find any penetration. The officer added that the suspect worked at a nearby buffalo pen. The police produced the suspect before a judicial magistrate on Thursday and obtained three-day physical remand for him. \n*NAMED WITHHELD TO PROTECT IDENTITY \nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 24 th , 2017.
