Â© Reuters \nWASHINGTON -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged a deep commitment to the alliance between their countries after Friday's summit here, while also announcing a new framework for economic dialogue. \n\"It is important that both Japan and the United States continue to invest very heavily in the alliance to build up our defense and our defensive capabilities,\" Trump said in a joint news conference. \n\"We have an unwavering bond,\" Abe said. \"We shared our commitment to further strengthen our relationship.\" \nTheir first summit at the White House lasted for about 30 minutes. Trump accepted Abe's invitation to visit Japan later this year. \nAbe and Trump reaffirmed their opposition to actions aimed at changing the status quo in national security, in an indirect reference to China in the South China Sea. The two also agreed to demand that North Korea abandon its nuclear and missile development program. The countries will work together \"to promote our shared interests,\" including the freedom \"of navigation, and defending against the North Korean missile and nuclear threat,\" Trump said at the conference. \nThe leaders also commented on Japan-U.S. economic ties at the press conference. \"We will seek a trading relationship that is free, fair and reciprocal, benefiting both of our countries,\" Trump said. \nAbe explained that they agreed to create a new framework for economic dialogue led by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Taro Aso, the Japanese deputy prime minister and finance minister. \"We will hold cross-sectoral talks,\" Abe said. He also expressed interest in American infrastructure projects. \nOn exchange rates, \"we agreed to continue the discussion through the Japanese and U.S. finance chiefs, who are experts on the matter,\" Abe said. \nThe duo also reaffirmed that the Japan-controlled, China-claimed Senkaku Islands are protected under Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. security treaty, which requires the U.S. to help defend Japanese territory.
