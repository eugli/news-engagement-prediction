PUBLISHED: 13:47, Fri, Feb 3, 2017 | UPDATED: 14:03, Fri, Feb 3, 2017 GETTY The number of Brits celebrating their 100th birthday will top a million in the 2060s \nMillennials are bracing themselves against the prospect of finally kicking the nine-to-five when they are in the mid-seventies as people continue to live longer, healthier lives. \nThe Treasury predicted the retirement age will rise by nearly a decade in the 2060s to cover the cost of an ageing population. \nIt estimates the number of Brits celebrating their 100th birthday will top a million by that time, a massive spike from the 15,000 which currently reach the milestone. \nThe state pension age, which is currently 65 for men and increasing from 60 to 65 for women, is set to rise steadily over the years .

GETTY Someone born in Chelsea has a life expectancy of 88 \nThe OBR says by 2063 that anyone born after 1989, in certain scenarios, can expect to be in work until they are 74. \nLib Dem Sir Steve Webb, a pensions minister in the Coalition government, said: “Our society could be transformed in ways for which we are totally unprepared. \n“It is clear that the Government has already built in an assumption of a pension age of 69 for today’s under-35s. But pension ages could rise much further and faster.
