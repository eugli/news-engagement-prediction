SWNS Officers had to escort students around the camping travellers \n“Not all pupils will be allowed in school - the school and the police are trying their best in these challenging circumstances. \n“There's still a stand-off and lots of shouting from the travellers. I've been to have a chat with the head teacher and some parents have decided not to send their children in today because of the travellers. \n“But the school has done their best to provide the best education as they said they would. \n“There's about three police vans, about six police cars and both ends of Long Nuke Road are still cordoned off.” \nFellow conservative councillor John Lines, who represents the Bartley Green Ward, added: “That is the worst yet. \n“They have ruined our parks and now they are invading our schools and not for education. SWNS Dozens of caravans moved onto the site on Friday \n“I'm horrified at this - and it's because we have been too soft with travellers. \n“I have residents who saw them breaking in and called the police, but they were told its a council problem. \n“Then we have the council saying its an academy school so it's not their problem. Everyone is passing the buck on this. \n“I can only thank the other schools who have rallied round to help out.“ \nA local resident who saw the gypsies arrive said: “I saw them pull into the car park and thought they were just turning around. \n“But they stopped and then started setting themselves up for what looks like a long stay. \n“The school needs to act quickly.“ \nAnother dad of one girl at the school, who did not want to be named, added: “Travellers wonder why they get a bad name. \n“Yet here is a group who are refusing to move from the grounds of a school, disrupting children's education and showing a flagrant disregard for the law. \n“The site is strew with rubbish and they need to be moved on immediately so the kids can get on with their schooling. \n“It is bad enough when they move on playing fields but its pretty low of them to move on to a school and refuse to move.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:22:05.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
