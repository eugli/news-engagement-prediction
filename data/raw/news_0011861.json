Artur Mas is going on trial with two former associates. The case is being used by pro-independence supporters to galvanise their campaign, and the current government has promised to hold a new vote in September. \nWill Catalonia try to secede this year? \nThe 9 November 2014 vote, which was not binding, went ahead despite fierce opposition by the Spanish government. \nCatalan officials say more than 80% of those who voted backed independence, however only two million voters out of an estimated 5.4 million eligible took part. \nCatalonia is one of Spain's richest and most highly-industrialised regions, and also one of the most independent-minded. \nWith a distinct history stretching back to the early Middle Ages, many Catalans think of themselves as a separate nation from the rest of Spain.
