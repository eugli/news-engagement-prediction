Police have rounded up three suspects as they work to unravel the details of the killing, although South Korean and US officials are in little doubt it was ordered in North Korea . Where the attackers struck \nKim was heading towards the check-in desks for a low-cost flight to Macau, where he had a home and family, when the assassins struck. \nAt least two women, one wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the letters LOL , approached Kim. While on woman distracted him, a second grabbed him in a chokehold and administered the poison, the local New Straits Times reported. \nIt is still not clear how the lethal dose was delivered, with conflicting reports of needles, a spray or even a cloth laced with poison held to Kim’s face. But whatever the method, it was over within seconds, and the women scattered. Kim Jong-nam airport graphic Kim’s last moments \nKim felt dizzy almost immediately and tried to head towards the airport toilets before doubling back to ask for help at an information desk. \nStaff there were alarmed by his condition, and took him to the airport clinic, where an ambulance was called. CCTV footage shows him slumped in an armchair and apparently grimacing in pain as he waited. \nKim gave a few brief details about the attack, police said, but soon slipped out of consciousness and died on his way to hospital. Local authorities were reluctant to confirm the killing at first, saying only that a North Korean with a passport in the name of Kim Chol had died at the airport. Kuala Lumpur international airport.

Thirty-six hours after his death, authorities confirmed the dead man’s identity and said his body would be returned to North Korea when the postmortem was completed. The getaway \nOne suspect was captured on CCTV camera heading down an escalator to the airport taxi rank outside the arrivals hall. As she raced for the exit, she apparently discarded a black glove she had been wearing on one hand – possibly as protection against lethal poison she had been handling. \nPolice collected numbers and possible destinations of taxis, and within days had arrested three people. The woman who had been wearing the LOL T-shirt was stopped trying to fly out of the same airport on Wednesday on a Vietnamese passport. It was not clear whether she was actually a Vietnamese citizen. \nThe other two people being held are an Indonesian woman, and a man thought to be her boyfriend. Police are hunting four men thought to have worked with the assassins, a government source told Reuters news agency. Kim Jong-nam death: Malaysian police make two more arrests – video report \nThe team behind the attack are thought to have flown into Malaysia some days earlier and checked into a hotel near the airport to monitor Kim’s movements. They split up straight after the killing and had not seen each other since, the woman travelling on the Vietnamese passport told police. Why was Kim a target? \nKim lived a largely private life but had apparently angered his younger half-brother with occasional criticism of North Korea’s government and its system of dynastic succession. The younger Kim may also have feared a threat to his power from his sibling, whom he reportedly had never met. \nKim Jong-nam was the eldest son of the late “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il and had been considered his designated heir until he fell from favour in 2001. He was caught trying to sneak into Japan on a fake passport, saying he wanted to visit Disneyland, and the bizarre incident apparently infuriated his father. \nAfter that the older Kim lived largely in exile, reportedly indulging a taste for gambling and setting up more than one home. But he could still have served as a possible leadership candidate, particularly for a faction seeking a change of rule but not wholesale overthrow of the current regime.

According to South Korea’s spy agency, in 2012 he wrote to Pyongyang begging for his family and himself to be spared. What has North Korea said? \nNorth Korean diplomats have reportedly objected to the autopsy and asked for Kim’s body to be repatriated to Pyongyang, but have made no further comment. \nNews of Kim’s death has not been reported inside the sealed-off state, where information is so closely controlled by the government that most citizens probably do not even know their leader had an older brother. \nThe death came as the country was gearing up for the “Day of the Shining Star”, the anniversary of the birthday of the Kim brothers’ father, and one of the most important days in the year. The celebrations on Thursday were not disrupted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T18:57:57.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
