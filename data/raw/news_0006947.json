Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times To the Editor: It is regrettable that The New York Times’s reporting on the cancellation of the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos’s appearance on the University of California, Berkeley, campus did not make clear that my administration reluctantly took that step only after determining that both the speaker’s and the public’s safety was highly endangered. Berkeley continues its iconic commitment to free speech, and we went to extraordinary lengths to facilitate planning and preparation for this event, working in close concert with the Berkeley College Republicans. Dozens of police officers were brought in from U.C. campuses across the state. Numerous crowd-control measures were put in place. But we could not plan for the unexpected. On Wednesday night, the Berkeley campus was invaded by more than 100 armed people in masks and dark uniforms who used paramilitary tactics to engage in violent destructive behavior intended to shut the event down. At that point the University of California Police Department concluded that the speaker had to be evacuated from campus for his own safety, bringing the event to an end. We deeply regret that the violence unleashed by this group undermined the First Amendment rights of the speaker as well as those who came to lawfully assemble and protest his presence. \nAdvertisement The violence was an attack on the fundamental values of the university, which stands for and helps maintain and nurture open inquiry and an inclusive civil society, the bedrock of a genuinely democratic nation.
