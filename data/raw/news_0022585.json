There has also been hate mail posted through the letterbox and other intrusive behaviour including trespassing in the private garden of the premises and attempts to take pictures through windows and the letterbox.” \nHe added that the returning officer for the byelection has been informed of the move. \nThe house has been the subject of controversy after it emerged last week that it had been declared as Nuttall’s address in his nomination papers for the byelection, on 23 February, before he was resident there. The Electoral Commission’s guidance for candidates says those standing in Westminster elections must give their current home address on their nomination papers; this cannot be just a business address. Nuttall filed his papers on 31 January. \nWhen Channel 4 News’s Michael Crick went to the house on 1 February, it appeared empty . When questioned by Channel 4, the Ukip leader said: “Yes. And I will be [living there]. I’m not now.” Staffordshire police subsequently said they were investigating after receiving a report of an allegation of election fraud. \nUkip said the party was “entirely happy that all rules have been complied with”. \nNuttall defended himself on Twitter, saying: “A candidate being attacked for being prepared to move to his constituency must be a first ...” \nThe byelection, in the strongly pro-leave seat , is a test of the Ukip leader’s stated intention to take seats from Labour in pro-Brexit areas. It was triggered when Labour’s Tristram Hunt, who had a majority of more than 5,000 over Ukip in 2015, stood down to head the Victoria & Albert Museum . \nWilliam Hill’s latest odds, published on Saturday, put Labour marginally ahead, quoted at 5/6 to win with Ukip on evens. \nIt is an offence under the Representation of the People Act 1983 to knowingly provide false information on a nomination paper; potential penalties are a fine or up to 51 weeks in jail.
