(Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) Chicago Tribune staff .\nThe group suspended dog adoptions Monday for the next three to four weeks after discovering several dogs at the shelter, 157 W. Grand Ave., had the disease, according to statements on the group's website. \nOn Monday, \"we discovered several cases of the virus in separate locations throughout the shelter. Because canine influenza has not been widely reported in the Chicago area in the past, many dogs have no immunity and will become ill if exposed,\" so the group decided to halt adoptions, according to a statement. \nThe strain of canine influenza found in dogs at the shelter is one that was first discovered in the Chicago area in 2015. The Anti-Cruelty Society put adoptions on hold in spring 2016 following a similar outbreak at the shelter. The Lake County, Ind., Animal Control and Adoption Center reopened last week after being closed for several weeks because of a similar outbreak. \nCat adoptions are not affected by the halt in dog adoptions. \nA call to Chicago's Animal Care and Control city shelter was not immediately returned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:06:49.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
