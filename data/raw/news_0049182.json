Fahrenthold for articles he wrote during the presidential campaign about activities that Donald Trump had tried to keep from public view.\n[ Searching for evidence of Trump’s personal giving ] \nFahrenthold was cited for a “dogged pursuit” of Trump that led to a year-long string of articles offering a picture “that Trump had long sought to keep secret.”\nIn announcing the 68th annual Polk awards, Long Island University said that Fahrenthold unmasked “deceptive and illegal charitable activities” on the part of Trump’s foundation.\nThe university said that Fahrenthold’s work also led to “a blockbuster — the existence of a video” in which Trump “bragged about sexually assaulting women.” It shaped political discourse for days, the university added.\n[ Trump recorded having lewd conversation about women in 2005 ] \nThe award for medical reporting went to reporters Lenny Bernstein and Scott Higham and editor David Fallis for tracing lax regulation of narcotic painkillers by the Drug Enforcement Administration “to pressure from the pharmaceutical industry and allies in Congress and the Justice Department.”\nAccording to the university, this was despite “rampant addiction” and nearly 180,000 deaths in the United States since 2000. The university credited the work with showing that the industry and its attorneys “apparently sought to mitigate oversight by hiring dozens of DEA officials,” including 31 from a unit charged with keeping prescription drugs off the black market.\n[ Drug industry hired DEA officials as agency tried to curb opioid abuse ] \nAwards were given in 15 categories and showed that even in a “tough year” for journalism, “bright spots” existed, Polk curator John Darnton said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:42:06.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
