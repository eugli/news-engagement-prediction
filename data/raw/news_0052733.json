Vanilla Cupcake m&m’s have the same pastel candy shells that are rolled out every spring on traditional chocolate m&m’s, but the Vanilla Cupcake variety is made with white chocolate instead of the cocoa-infused kind. (There are also regular White Chocolate m&m’s. Vanilla Cupcake, which will be sold exclusively at Target , is an entirely different animal.) Look for Vanilla Cupcake m&m’s in the bright purple bag edged in pastel polka dots—not to be confused with the other purple bags, which hold regular and peanut Dark Chocolate m&m’s. \nVanilla Cupcake m&m’s arrive on the heels of Coffee Nut m&m’s, which were made a permeant flavor in July of last year. \nOther newcomers from Mars this spring include Dove Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter Eggs, a Marshmallow Mix Variety Bag, which contains with Milky Way Marshmallow Minis and 3 Musketeers Marshmallow Minis. (We haven’t heard of those last two things, either.) In addition to Vanilla Cupcake m&m’s, Target is also exclusively selling Peeps Strawberry Confetti Easter Eggs , Lindt White Chocolate Citrus Eggs and this one-pound (ONE-POUND) Gummy Bunny . You know, in case you need another excuse to run to Target.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:04:37.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
