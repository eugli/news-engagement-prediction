Hey, even Bill Belichick says he had to replay the game at 4 a.m. to make sure the New England Patriots really won. \nThe Tom Brady superlatives have been rolling in, with Skip Bayless declaring that Brady surpassed Michael Jordan “as the greatest clutch player in all of sports history”, and Shannon Sharpe calling Brady “the greatest football player in the 97-year history of the NFL.” \nColin Cowherd joined the praise parade, saying that Brady joined the ranks of Jordan, Muhammad Ali and Babe Ruth in becoming the face of his sport. \n“From this point forward, I think of the NFL, I think of Tom Brady,” Cowherd said on “The Herd” on Tuesday. “I think Tom’s completely separated from everybody else at that position. Wins, records, Super Bowl records, Super Bowl appearances — I think he’s now the face of the league.” \nCowherd said Brady settled the “best quarterback ever” debate with a legend-making moment similar to Jordan’s “Flu Game”. \n“It’s Tom’s mythical game, kind of capping his career. I thought it was as big a game as any quarterback’s ever had in this league.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:50:12.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
