Kim Woodburn proved her penchant for all things outrageous hasn't waned on Friday, as she judged G-A-Y's infamous Porn Idol competition in London\nThe competition sees members of the audience and amateurs strip onstage and dance around on a pole.\nNotorious for its X-rated antics, the contest has previously drawn in a host of famous faces as judges - including CBB star Daniella Westbrook, Coach Trip’s Brendan Sheerin and Charlotte Crosby.\nWearing a blue dress and leather boots, Kim looked typically preened for her judging duties at the explicit event.\nKim was catapulted back into the limelight last month after coming third on Celebrity Big Brother, losing out to runners-up Jedward and winner Coleen Nolan.\nAvert your eyes! The How Clean Is Your House? star, 74, looked positively outraged as one enthusiastic contestant scaled a pole, clad in just a pair of boxers\n'You chinless wonders!' She pulled a look of distaste as she spoke into the microphone\nAnd she was quick to express how disgruntled she is that Coleen took this season's CBB crown, admitting that she doesn't understand what the voting public were thinking.\n'How that woman won Big Brother with Jedward sitting there is beyond me!' the former How Clean Is Your House star exclaimed.\n'She was a boring fag ash lil! She shouldn't have won. I'm tired of all these Loose Women winning!'\nReferring to the fact that, to date, three of the ladies from the Loose Women panel have scooped the accolade of Celebrity Big Brother winner across the show's run (Denise Welch reigning in 2012 and Katie Price in 2015), Kim branded Coleen as 'awful' and an undeserved winner.\n'I'd rather Nicola had won!' she said - a shocking admission given Kim and Nicola McLean's fractious and often vehement altercations in the house.\nX-rated antics: One naked amateur stripper actually jumped into Kim's seat, covering his modesty with just a sheaf of paper\nCan't believe her eyes! Kim looked on expectantly as one dancer got down onto his knees in front of her\n'The woman was just running with the foxes and hunting with the hounds!' Kim said of Coleen, accusing her of being a dull housemate who simply went along with the rest of the celebrities inside CBB manor.\nSpeaking to the MailOnline, Kim said that everyone else in there was 'desperate to win' - which lead to their 'gang-handed' treatment of her on the show.\nDiscussing the infamous evening she was escorted by security out of the house for a much-needed cool off following a tiff with the others, Kim said: I was glad to be taken away; frankly I'd worn myself to the bone - and I'm a tough woman!'\nIn the house, she came to blows with many of her housemates - and was even removed by security during one booze-filled night.\nExplicit: One contestant swung around a pole completely naked\nInfamous: The contest has previously drawn in a host of famous faces as judges - including CBB star Daniella Westbrook, Coach Trip’s Brendan Sheerin and Charlotte Crosby\nClashing with Jamie O'Hara and Nicola McLean, she told the pair they were an 'absolute disgrace!' and a 'bunch of chinless wonders!' - adding that she wouldn't 'sh*t on them if they were on fire'.\nAnd since leaving the CBB house, Kim has caused similar chaos on chat shows - most notably on This Morning, where she clashed with Phillip Schofield in a wince-inducing interview.\nKim showed she's as passionate as ever as she had a very heated argument with Phillip, in which she threatened to 'crucify him' and calling him a 'phoney', leading to today's revelation that he feared she would 'kill him'.\nPhillip said: 'She nearly killed me. If she had got past Holly she would have done', shortly before correspondent Rylan Clark-Neal did an impression of the professional cleaner.\nNotorious: The competition sees members of the audience and amateurs strip onstage and dance around on a pole\nBum's the word: Kim looked mildly unimpressed as one contestant showcased her behind to the audience\n'You’ve got a long time to work on television, I’m 74, if I never got another television show, I couldn’t give a toss! You see, I’m not a diplomat like you [Phillip],' Kim said. 'And I am telling you the truth.\nShe added: 'I loved the money. Adorable! It beats cleaning lavvies! But no, I may be 74, but don’t mess with me…don’t bully me, I’ve been around for too long.'\nHolly said, 'I wouldn’t, I’m terrified!' Phillip said, 'Are you saying that we are bullying you?'\nKim, to Phillip, 'You are giving me the impression that you don’t know what you’re talking about Phillip. Go in that house for twenty four hours and sit there, then you tell me why I was annoyed.'\nShe's out! Kim Woodburn, 74, reached boiling point and was removed from the main house in Celebrity Big Brother after an explosive row with Jamie O'Hara, 30\nPhillip said: 'I get it, I understand…. But I know why people reacted in the way that they reacted to you because of the way you make me feel sitting on the sofa - you’re already making me feel confrontational… we are just asking you questions, that’s our job!'\nHolly said, 'This is Big Brother, could we split up the argument that’s happening here!'\nKim replied: 'No you’re not Phil, you big phoney.'\nAs the adverts rolled, Kim could be seen glaring at Phill in a very awkward stand-off, but after the commercials, Phill said Kim left in good spirits.\nHe said: 'Kim left and said to me, \"You're a bit of a b*", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-24T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:37:53.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
