According to him, there is the need for the people of this country to ensure the change that came in last year’s elections is reflected in punctuality to public functions. Delivering the State of the Nation Address to parliament on Tuesday February 21, Mr Akufo-Addo said: “I do not intend to interfere in any way in the affairs of parliament or the judiciary but I will be failing in my duty if I fail to say what needs to be said.” “All three arms of government – the executive, the judiciary and the legislature – need to take cognisance of the clear desire of the people of Ghana for change. All three branches must change the way we do things. I ask this honourable House to take a candid look at itself and consider changing the way it conducts business if need be.” He added: “There are some areas of our lives in which we can all demonstrate the change for which the people of Ghana have voted – punctuality, sanitation, and care of the environment. “Over the years, it has become acceptable practice that official functions invariably start and close late. We invite people to functions from 9am and start at 10am. I have heard some offer the preposterous excuse that there is something cultural about not paying attention to time. Thus, all show that we acknowledge the change that has come by being punctual to functions and I intend to set a personal example.” Related Articles:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:08:45.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
