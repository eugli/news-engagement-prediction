Allen Iverson (Getty Images) \n  \nUpdated at 11:54 p.m. ET \nTo observers of Allen Iverson's NBA career, the notion he might one day coach in the league is a bit laughable. \nThat's why the Basketball Hall of Fame member's participation in BIG3, the 3-on-3 league for retired players founded by the entertainer Ice Cube, has basketball fans' imaginations running wild. Iverson will take on a role as a player-coach, with emphasis on the latter, but don't expect the experience to ignite NBA coaching aspirations. \n\"Hell no!\" Iverson told TMZ Sports when asked if there would be more X's and O's in his future during the NBA's All-Star Weekend. \nHow come? \n\"'Cause I ain't coaching no m— f—s who make more money than me,\" he said. \"How the hell am I gonna tell them anything?\" \nThere you have it. \nIn a news conference last week, Iverson said it was a \"no-brainer\" to join the league, which begins play this summer. Kenyon Martin, Chauncey Billups and Stephen Jackson are among some of the other retired NBA players to sign up. \nThe 2001 NBA MVP, and 11-time All-Star, did tell TMZ he hoped fellow legend Kobe Bryant might follow suit. \n\"I hope he would, but I know he ain't,\" Iverson said. \"But that would be a dream of mine\" to play with Bryant. \n\"I want Shaq (O'Neal) to play with me too,\" he added. \"It won't go down like that. It would be too easy.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:02:02.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
