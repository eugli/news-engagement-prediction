Another two VBIEDS approached the camp but they never penetrated the defence lines after they were taken out by high calibre weapons. The Major, together with another officer of equal rank, and three Captains, commanded a total of 250 soldiers at the camp. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT \nMajor Denis Girenge, the commander of the Kenya Defence Forces camp at Kulbiyow that was attacked by Al-Shabaab on January 27 has for the first time given a blow-by-blow account of the battle against the estimated 1,000 militants. \nThe major, whose narrative was backed by footage shot by a drone that the military showed to the Sunday Nation, said a day earlier he received a call from an officer based at the Hulugho camp manned by KDF soldiers, who reported strange movements about 12km away that they suspected were Al-Shabaab militants. \n“We concluded that they were planning to attack either my camp or Hulugho because from that point, we were 14km away while Hulugho was 18 kilometres away,” said Major Girenge. \nHe added: “I decided to send out a patrol at night, 5km north of my position so that they could spot an enemy approaching. \n\"At 6 pm I called my men and briefed them. We reconfigured our defence to replace the men who had gone out.” \nAt 3am one of the sentries informed him about some movements, like a heavy vehicle was moving.

We decided we should call surveillance guys. \n\"We had tried to call the locals to ask if they had spotted anything but none of their phones were going through,” he said. \nThe surveillance team at Hulugho dispatched Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, better known as drones, for the surveillance mission. \nThe drones were airborne within 10 minutes and from his command centre at the camp, the Major was monitoring images relayed from the skies. \n“At around 3.30am I saw a sizable group in a bush, about 80 guys and it’s like they were receiving a briefing. We got the grid and laid our weapons including mortars and hit the place,” said Major Girenge. \nTHE ATTACK It disrupted their meeting and they all rose and started running towards the camp. \n“We were about 4km away. We could see them from the drone images. \n\"We kept on hitting but the group kept on increasing and we established that many other people had crept in, in groups during the day and were hiding in the bushes,” added Major Girenge. \nAt that point he called his commander in Manda and informed him that the numbers of the attackers was increasing by the minute despite the relentless firing. \nThe group then stopped at a village called Bulaqoqon, which is about 1.5 kilometres from the camp, and started marching towards the camp after about 10 minutes. \n“At this point their number was a thousand plus. But before they began moving again, they all bowed to the ground and started praying. \n\"We could see all that from the drone. We hit them at that point and they started moving,” Major Girenge said. \nBy 5.15am the group was 800 metres away from the camp’s first line of defence positions. \n“I ordered my men to open their small arms, and start hitting them. All this time they had not fired back. Until about 5.45am they fired the first shot. \n\"So I reported to CO (commanding officer) that we have established contact. My commander told me he has already scrambled aircrafts and they would be taking off,” said the major. \nHe went on: “The battle was on and everybody was busy. One soldier called me on radio and his exact words were Afande iko VBIEDs zinakuja, (Sir there are Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devices approaching).” \nA VBIED is simply a bomb on wheels. \n“I told him to engage 84 mm calibre weapon which we use to destroy heavy vehicles. He fired and it exploded outside. \n\"The explosion was so massive and that changed the scenario. It created a gap and suicide bombers followed,” said Major Girenge. \nThe explosion created a massive impact because fragments were felt in a radius of 200 meters. \nFAKE PHOTOS Another two VBIEDS approached the camp but they never penetrated the defence lines after they were taken out by high calibre weapons. \n“The explosion was massive and I believe that is what led to the number of casualties we sustained,” added Major Girenge. \nSitting on a bench outside his ward at the Defence Forces Memorial Hospital in Nairobi, he continued to narrate the events without batting an eyelid. \nThe battle-hardened soldier has fought in Somalia starting with his time at the rank of Captain. \nHe was in Kismayu in 2012 and the company he was leading had also taken Fafadun from Al-Shabaab in the same year. \nCol Kenneth Mungai answers questions during an interview with Nation at Defence Forces Memorial Hospital in Nairobi on February 4, 2017.

By 7am all guns were silent and I could hear a few remnants shouting as they pulled their bodies and run away. \n\"I called Army operations to say firing had ceased and we are consolidating and asked choppers to come in and help casualties,” added Mjr Girenge. \nBy 9am rescue helicopters had come and I was among the first to be airlifted. \nHe sustained gunshot wounds on his left arm, legs and lower abdomen.
