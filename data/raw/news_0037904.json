All three, John Wall , Anthony Davis and Karl-Anthony Towns , are enjoying successful NBA careers. And, yes, all three are making a boatload of money by playing the sport. \nDuring that span, Kentucky has made four Final Four appearances and notched a national championship. \nSo don’t expect Calipari’s stance as a huge advocate for the one-and-done rule to change anytime soon. He’s making a living off it and feels that it benefits both the team and players involved. \nIn an interview with Bleacher Report , Calipari responded to critics who believe the one-and-done rule is a “sham” because they only spend one year at the college level. The coach’s stance might make you think twice if you’re not a proponent. \n“And they can come back and finish up!” Calipari said. “They can do it [finish school] whenever. Tell me what the issue is with that. And let me tell you this: For those of you that think what we’re doing is a sham: What if it were your child? Would you think it’s OK then?” \nThat perspective might (or might not) change your mind, but from a monetary standpoint it probably should. According to Forbes , 2016 No. 1 overall pick Ben Simmons will earn a maximum of $26,620,450 over the life of his rookie deal. And that doesn’t include money like shoe deals, endorsements, etc., which are all things a first-round pick almost certainly finds. \nThe way college basketball has evolved over the years, the NBA talent typically filters through blueblood schools like Kentucky, Kansas or Duke before jumping to the NBA. While many people dislike the rule solely because it allows kids a one-year stay in college, thus putting an emphasis on sports over school, there’s no denying it has been successful for some players. \nCalipari is a longtime backer -- and with his team’s success utilizing those players, that likely won’t change anytime soon.
