The ingredients for a great love affair and great sex are different. For great sex, you need bucket loads of chemistry, matching libidos, a thirst for adventure and an open mind. To love someone you need to connect on deeper emotional levels, be intellectually compatible and morally similar. This is why you might have had ridiculously extraordinary orgasms with the guy who was so horribly wrong for you but disappointingly diluted ones with a husband you love dearly. Tracey says that just because you love someone that doesn't guarantee great sex Some choose the orgasms over love but most (rather sensibly) figure there’s only so much time you can have sex and let the love side take precedence. I like getting quite wild and noisy in bed but it seems to freak men out. Should I calm it down? For every person who shouts ‘Thank you God!’ at the top of their lungs at the crucial moment, there’s one who remains completely and utterly silent. If you’re a loud, lusty girl matched with an equally passionate vocal guy, feel free to startle the pants off your neighbours (though remember you may be standing in line with them in your local Sainsbury’s the next day). If you’ve gone for someone very different to you, however, they may well find your theatrics alarming (we distrust what we’re not used to which is why shy tends to date shy and rowdy, rowdy). Others simply don’t believe all that sheet-gripping and dramatic thrashing about is genuine and suspect you’re putting in all on. Decide beforehand which category your new partner falls into and adjust accordingly. Another way to play it is to start quietly, then up the moans and groans and volume as you go along. How do I thrust when I’m on top? This sounds like a silly question but it’s not: most of the time it’s him on top, so women have much less experience of it. There are two ways to position yourself, experiment to find out which one suits you. First, try squatting over him so your feet are flat (if there’s a bed head, you could lean forward and grab this for balance) and use your calf and upper thigh muscles to lift you up and down. The sex expert says that your libido will be hire during pregnancy because you will have more hormones in your body Or straddle him so you’re resting on your knees and use your upper thigh and buttock muscles to thrust. If you really can’t get the hang of it, the cheat’s way is to get him to hold you around the waist and lift you up and down or you stay completely still as he thrusts underneath you. Can using a vibrator ‘ruin’ you for sex without it? A vibrator is by far the quickest and most effective way to make a woman orgasm. Which is why they can get a teensy bit addictive when you first use one. Because it only takes mere minutes with a mechanical device, you tend to detour to the bedroom every time you make a cup of coffee - which can be a problem if you’re an eight cup a day girl! If you’re using a vibrator this often you can temporarily numb and ‘desensitise’ your genitals – meaning if your partner tries to stimulate you, you won’t feel much at all. But, like most new toys, the thrill wears off and it all settles down to anything between once a day or once a week. The only way this could have an adverse affect on your sex life is if you train your brain to only orgasm with this type of stimulation. Tracey says not to worry about your orgasm face - the weirder the face the more passionate the lover! If all your orgasms are achieved through vibration, your brain starts to tread the same neural pathway over and over. Eventually, it starts to think this is the only way to orgasm and gets confused if fingers, a tongue or a penis try to accomplish the same thing. (Imposters!) Mix up vibrator orgasms with orgasms via stimulation with fingers, oral sex and (if you’re one of the lucky ones) penetration and I can guarantee you won’t be ‘ruined’. Spoilt maybe, but not ruined. My previous boyfriend used to constantly make fun of the face I make when I orgasm. It’s made me really self-conscious and I’m now dreading having sex with any future boyfriends. He’s an ex for a reason: tactlessness. Lots of us make weird ‘orgasm faces’ – and I have to say, the more passionate the lover, the weirder the face. So take it as a compliment! Good sex is sloppy, sweaty and immensely unflattering. We hyperventilate, frown, scream, show our tonsils and do a lot of scrunching up of our faces. You’re normal. I suspect the teasing was prompted by jealousy: he wishedhe could lose himself in the moment so totally. I didn’t have a huge sex drive before I got pregnant but now that’s all I can think about. Why? In a word: hormones. Your body has such a high concentration of female and pregnancy hormones, your breasts and sex organs are more sensitive and responsive than they ever have been. And perhaps ever will be. (Something positive to focus on when your partner excitedly suggests you have another baby, minutes after what felt like a 300-year labour). Plenty of pregnant women find sex more exciting and satisfying during this period – lots experience orgasm for the first time, others have multiples. A rise of oestrogen causes an increase in blood flow to the pelvic area, in turn causing stretching and swelling which normally only happens when you’re sexually excited. This means your sensory nerve endings are hypersensitive – without any stimulation at all – which means rapid arousal when you are. Your breasts are bigger (a turn on for both of you if you never progressed past a training bra) and pregnancy also causes you to secrete more vaginal fluid, so you feel and are ready for penetration earlier. It’s entirely safe, by the way, to have sex whenever you want to, so long as it’s not too athletic and you haven’t been advised not to for medical reasons. Conception and pregnancy guru, Miriam Stoppard, says it’s actually safe to have intercourse right up till the point when you go into labour. I can’t imagine too many women taking advantage of this but it’s certainly an alternative to flicking listlessly through your phone. Want more quirky sex questions?
