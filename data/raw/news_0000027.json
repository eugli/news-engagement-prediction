Our contribution to a sustainable development \nAt Siemens we believe companies only really succeed if they fulfill the needs of the society they work in. That means business has a responsibility for economic and social development, and that businesses must add lasting value to the countries and communities they work in. This requires us to measure corporate success by much more than profit. \nWith the “Siemens - Business to Society” (B2S) approach we measure our contribution to sustainable development and highlight how we make real what matters. We use our customized B2S methodology to objectively assess and determine the impact of a specific project, site, business, or of our activities in an entire country. \n\nCompanies like Siemens must demonstrate how their business interests are aligned with the national development agenda, and play an active role in economic and societal development. They must account for their social and environmental impact, and show how citizens benefit from business operations. Being a responsible company means working in partnership with society and being part of its long-term development. \n\nThe Siemens B2S methodology has been developed to measure and demonstrate our contribution to the sustainable development of a country to our various stakeholders, customers, government, suppliers, employees and potential recruits, as well as the wider public. \n\nOur reference for determining the value we create for society is the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It sets out 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, to protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all. \nSo, what is our impact on the things that matter to society globally?
