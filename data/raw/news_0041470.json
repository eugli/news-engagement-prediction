PUBLISHED: 02:27,   03:00,   The hearing took place in the High Court's Family Division \nThe family, of who are said have lived in Britain for around 13 years, were alerted to social services three years ago after social workers became aware the family had become destitute. \nAstonishingly, the father had previously threatened to jump off a bridge with the children unless the council provided a “new house and financial assistance to the level he sought”.

GETTY The father threatened to jump off a bridge with the children unless given welfare by the council \nBut the couple started a “conflict” with social workers and believed their local council should provide “wholly” for the family. \nThe children were used “directly to demand money” and shockingly hid in cupboards to stop social workers seeing them. \nMr Justice Keehan said adoption would be in the “welfare best interest” of the children, aged seven and five, and would provide “stability, security and permanence”. GETTY The mother \"overstayed\" in the UK after legitimately arriving in the country \nThe ruling came following a private hearing in the High Court’s Family Division in London. \nJustice Keehan did not identify the family by name, but indicated they had lived in Birmingham. \nThe judge said both parents were of “south Indian origin” and had lived in Britain for around 13 years. GETTY Mr Justice Keehan ruled the children should be put up for adoption \nHe added that social workers thought the youngsters had been “puppets” in a “war of attrition”. \nJustice Keehan also indicated the father was still in the UK but said the mother was living abroad. 2017: The Year Ahead", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:07:12.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
