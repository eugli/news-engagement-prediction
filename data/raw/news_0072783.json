Jones , USA TODAY 12:03 a.m. ET Feb. 26, 2017 \nTake heart. (Photo: Jean-Baptiste Lacroix, AFP/Getty Images) \nA Certain woman has advice for those feeling fatigued by President Trump’s administration. \nAwards darling Lily Gladstone — who scored three critics awards, including an LA Film Critics award , as well as a Spirit Awards nomination for her role in the indie drama Certain Women — offered a spirited message at Saturday’s Film Independent Spirit Awards . \n“Rely on each other,” she said on the blue carpet. “The people who are in power are convincing everybody through very, very old techniques: You know, divide and conquer, hit everybody with all this painful, horrible legislation and build proposals all at once so we get exhausted and we feel like we’re totally disenfranchised and disempowered. It’s not true.” \n“We are the people,” she continued. “We’re all in this together, whether it’s women in film or the LGBTQ communities or the nonprofit that’s making sure that low-income kids have a meal at the end of the day. You know, just keep pushing and keep uplifting and supporting each other, because our whole country has been built by people’s hard work and love and commitment to their communities and that’s not going anywhere ...(The administration has) too much power but not the power of the people when we’re united.” Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lHVZ5n Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T12:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:06:45.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
