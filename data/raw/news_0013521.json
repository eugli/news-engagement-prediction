Some tours listed are self-guided. Route notes and maps will be provided. You will need some extra money to cover meals and drinks not included in the tour price and any optional sightseeing. High quality bikes are provided on most tours, with some operators offering optional electric bikes. It may also be possible to bring your own bike – but double-check.
