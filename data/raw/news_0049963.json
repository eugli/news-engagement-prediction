Scoring 72 goals in 101 youth appearances (U18 and U21 levels combined) before age 19, Tammy was clearly ready for the next step, so he essentially graduated from the Academy and headed out on his first senior loan this summer. It took him just 27 minutes into his first start at Bristol City to open his goal-scoring account and he’s hardly stopped scoring since. Despite all his goals — currently third in the division with 18 — Bristol have just three wins since mid-October and their season has turned into a relegation fight after a good start. The Robins currently sit just one position and two points above the relegation zone. And it looks like their task just got tougher, with Abraham expected to miss the next 2-3 weeks with a thigh strain he picked up in the 2-1 loss to Leeds United. It could’ve been worse however, as the initial prognosis was for twice as long. “Tammy is a big loss, because of the goals he has scored for us this season, how he has been in training and what he has done for the team. But it could have been a lot worse and this is the best case scenario really. I'm quite pleased about that, because at one stage, it looked as though he might be out for six to eight weeks.” -Lee Johnson; source: Bristol Post Abraham has scored over 40 per cent of the team’s goals this season, and given the busy match calendar of the Championship, he could miss up to 4-5 games, even, in the next few weeks. Bristol City certainly have their work cut out for them to not drop any further in the table.
