Instead of shouting aimlessly into the social media void as so many others do when it comes to the president's controversies, Rogen instead took advantage of the fact Trump's son, Donald Jr, was a fan of his and followed his account. After spotting that, the comedian decided to send Trump Jr a series of direct messages outlining why he thinks Don's dad should walk away from the White House. 'Yo! @DonaldJTrumpJr! I noticed you follow me on Twitter . Please ask your dad to resign before he destroys the planet. Thanks dude,' Rogen wrote. This is the first of a series of messages Rogen sent to Trump Jr on Twitter on Thursday He then posted a series of pictures showing lengthier messages he sent to the president's son. 'Hey man! It's Seth. Your father is trying to discredit our media, collude with Russia, and destroy the environment. It would be super cool of you to be like, \"yo, dad, why don't you stop all this and go back to being just a guy on TV.\" The majority of the world would be pretty psyched. Thanks!!!' the first message read. 'Also, please tell your dad that this guy Jason Chaffetz, you know the dude with the awesome Twitter handle @jasoninthehouse should probably investigate Flynnâ€™s connection to Russia because he got fired over it. Thanks man! Have a good one.' Rogen posted pictures of a series of messages he sent to Trump Jr on Thursday on Twitter RELATED ARTICLES", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T13:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T11:08:12.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
