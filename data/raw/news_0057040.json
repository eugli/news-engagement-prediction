With your fingers, press the dough into a 12-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, taking care to push the crust into the indentations on the sides. \n* Pat until the crust is even. Bake for 10-12 mins, until very lightly browned. Set aside to cool. \nFor Filling * Melt chocolate and butter in a heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat and cool for 5 mins. \n* Whisk together eggs, cream, sugar, salt, and vanilla in a bowl. Whisk chocolate mixture into the egg mixture until it’s well mixed. \n* Pour filling into the cooled crust and rap the pan once on counter to eliminate any air bubbles. \n* Bake for 20-25 mins until the filling is set keeping a gap of 1 inch from the edge. Check that the tart is slightly puffed but the centre trembles slightly when pan is gently shaken. Centre will continue to set as it cools. \n* Demould it and cool tart completely. Sprinkle cocoa powder over it. \n* Take a heart shape cutter and sprinkle icing sugar in the center of the tart. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:21:13.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
