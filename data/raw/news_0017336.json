The 'sandstorm' is set across 5km and 10km distances with more than 40 unique obstacles. This year is going to be the first edition of Sandstorm race as a featured qualifying event for the 2017 world championship. The theme integrates well with the region's sand dunes and environment. \"Seventy per cent of the UAE population is obese and overweight,\" said Cedric Betis, Chairman, DH Corp Wellness Programme. \"So it is important to create a platform for people to come out and participate in the race. Along with the top athletes, the event is open to families.\" \"Some obstacles will be fun but some are going to be really tough and high. There will team building activities and we are expecting 5,000 people to attend it and 3,000 people have registered so far. Women participants are going to be in good in number, as well.\" Male and female winners in the sandstorm 10km circuit will participate in the world championships from October 13 to 15th in Canada this year.
