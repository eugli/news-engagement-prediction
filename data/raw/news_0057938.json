He sat across from them and watched. “At that point my daughter reached up to scratch her back and she felt her back was covered in some sort of sticky wet liquid,” the mother said. “So she took off her sweater and her and her friends looked at it and it was covered in a sticky white substance, which was now all over her hands.” \nWATCH: Police say girls did all the right things in St. Vital Centre incident \nThe mother suspects the substance was semen and police said that is likely. \n“There’s info to support that it may be a bodily fluid, absolutely,” said Winnipeg Police Constable Jason Michalyshen. “Clothing has been seized and DNA testing is pending.” \nPolice say the testing results could take months. \n“To call this anything less than disturbing is fair to say,” Michalyshen said. “It’s uncomfortable to talk about. But we have to talk about the uncomfortable things.” \nWhile this is a bizarre incident, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection (CCCP) said anytime a child or teenager feels unsafe they need to speak up. \n“We often hear, especially with kids, they aren’t sure if it’s serious enough,” said Noni Classen, the education director with the CCCP. “It doesn’t have to be extreme for them to acknowledge they need help.” \nClassen also reiterated that parents need to have these conversations continually and make sure their kids know to ask for help. \n“It’s about letting an adult within the facility know what is going on, ” she said. “Also, talking about the anomaly, the rareness of the situation. Remind them of all of the times they have gone to places, that people are generally safe, but, sometimes people can do something to make you feel uncomfortable.” \nPolice are looking for a Caucasian man in his 40s to 50s, approximately 5’7” – 5’8” tall, with a heavy build and a wrinkled, weathered-looking face. Police say he was wearing a blue felt hat and a blue plaid jacket. \nWinnipeg police sex crimes unit investigating disturbing incident at St. Vital Centre.
