His new device would control the insulin in a patient’s bloodstream using light. “It could address this critical problem in human health — the delivery of insulin,” said Simon Friedman , a professor at the UMKC School of Pharmacy. “Potentially in a single injection, you could easily have a week’s worth of insulin. Even if we inject one time a day, we’re still ahead of the game.” Simon Friedman, a professor with the University of Missouri-Kansas City, explains to a… more University of Missouri-Kansas City Friedman’s goal: building a system that can continuously deliver precise amounts of insulin using light. It’s impossible to achieve this level of precision with standard insulin injections, but it can be delivered with an insulin pump. “It’s a very delicate balance. ... Your requirement is varying minute by minute,” Friedman said. “We’re trying to have the continuous variability of the pump and eliminate the invasiveness.” Friedman came up with the idea about 10 years ago while he was conducting research on how light can control gene expression. He began dedicating resources to the project in 2011, working with a team of researchers to build molecules that release insulin when exposed to light. Although Friedman originally thought of handing off the project long ago, as he dived into the research, that possibility dissolved. “We’re kind of at the bleeding edge,” Friedman said. “We’re in a unique position with the skill set to do it. We’ve been thinking and dreaming in the chemistry of insulin for a long time.” He described the chemical process as similar to the way skin uses sunlight to make vitamin D. Insulin is bound to an insoluble substance and injected beneath the surface of the skin, where it remains inactive. The injection site is covered with an armband-like device, to prevent exposure to light. By controlling the substance’s light exposure, it can release a measured amount of insulin into the bloodstream. “The less invasive, the more likely people will use it,” Friedman said. “You can control the amount of light very easily.” Most recently, his team published a trial indicating the device’s success in diabetic mice. Not only did the substance release insulin in response to multiple flashes of light, but it also released enough to bring down the animals’ blood-sugar levels. The next set of trials will focus on the durability of different materials and their efficacy over time. His team also is testing numerous substances to find those that yield optimal results. “When you’re trying to do something practical you have to be very aware of all challenges and engage with them,” Friedman said. “Animal models are critical for this work. … Everything is incremental.” In the long term, Friedman’s goal is to develop the ideal artificial pancreas. His team won a $1.4 million grant from the National Institutes of Health for this purpose in 2015. “The NIH grant came at just the right time and allowed us to push forward,” he said. “More resources means more trials, more iterations and more people to recruit.” Specifically, Friedman would focus on one facet of the artificial pancreas — the mechanism for insulin delivery. Others already have developed the other pieces, he said. Continuous glucose monitors constantly measure a patient’s blood-sugar levels to allow for more precise insulin dosage, and algorithms allow those devices to communicate with systems delivering insulin. Ideally, patients no longer would have to measure and inject multiple times a day. “It could be a real shift in the way diabetics are treated,” Friedman said.
