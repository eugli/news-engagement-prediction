His status as the most successful Leicester City manager of all time is without question,” the club said in a statement. \n“However, domestic results in the current campaign have placed the club’s Premier League status under threat and the board reluctantly feels that a change of leadership, while admittedly painful, is necessary in the club’s greatest interest.” \nThe club is, however, in the last 16 of the Champions League and lost 2-1 to Sevilla in the first leg on Wednesday. \nLeicester vice chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha says “we are duty-bound to put the club’s long-term interests above all sense of personal sentiment.” \nMORE TO COME", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:34:22.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
