Service charges account for more than one-third of IRCTC’s revenue. \n\nThe government-owned website, which gets a commission on each ticket sold, posted a 32% increase in revenue to Rs 1,506 crore in fiscal 2016, according to its annual report. \n\nRevenue earned through service charge was the fastest-growing segment, doubling from Rs 256.34 crore to Rs 551.49 crore in fiscal 2016. \n\nIRCTC charges Rs 40 on every ticket booked in air-conditioned classes. For sleeper class, a service charge of Rs 20 is levied. \n\n“Leaving behind several high profile ecommerce sites worldwide, e-ticketing accounted for 58.5% of reserved tickets in India booked online during 2015-16, which has now risen to around 60%. On an average, more than 5.45 lakh tickets were sold daily through IRCTC’s website during 2015-16,\" the company said in its annual report. \n\nIRCTC also earns revenue through sales of Rail Neer bottled water, onboard catering and licence fees from outsourced catering vendors. \n\nThe company sold train tickets worth Rs 24,022 crore online in the year ended March 2016, although growth halved to 17% from a year earlier as its customer base stagnated. \n\nNet profit grew 44% to Rs 189 crore.
