The doctors’ union sent freedom of information requests to all the areas asking for their estimates to implement the STPs and 37 replied, with the figures quoted in responses totalling £9.53bn. \nDr Mark Porter, the BMA’s chief, said: “These figures are especially concerning given that everyone can see a huge crisis unfolding within our NHS, with record numbers of trusts and GP practices raising the alarm to say they already can’t cope. \n“The NHS is at breaking point and the STP process could have offered a chance to deal with some of the problems that the NHS is facing, like unnecessary competition, expensive fragmentation and buildings and equipment often unfit for purpose. But there is clearly nowhere near the funding required to carry out these plans.” \nMore than half of the STP areas have told NHS England they would each need more than £100m of upfront funding to make changes. Six – Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Cheshire and Merseyside, Greater Manchester, North Central London, North East London and West Yorkshire – have quoted capital needs of £500m or more. \nThe BMA says that NHS leaders are unlikely to have anything near the cash required to deliver the projects, with budgets already under severe pressure. The annual capital allocation of £4.8bn granted to the Department of Health from 2016/17 to 2020/21 is being used in part to cover large hospital deficits, it says. \nAt a hearing last month of the public accounts committee – which scrutinises government expenditure, the NHS Providers chief executive, Chris Hopson, said a quarter of the capital budget (£1.2bn) had been taken “to prop up revenue”, and the health department’s finance director, David Williams, said raids on the capital budget were likely to continue. \nAlthough the NHS says the STPs are vital to the future of the service, they have proved highly controversial as they are likely to lead to the axing of thousands of hospital beds, A&E units being downgraded or closed and women facing long trips to give birth . \nPorter said: “These plans are fast becoming completely unworkable and have instead revealed a health service that is unsustainable without urgent further investment, and with little capacity to ‘transform’ in any meaningful way other than by reducing the provision of services on a drastic scale.” \nTom Sandford, the Royal College of Nursing director of England, said: “We have always supported the aims of the plans – preventing ill health, joining up services, delivering care closer to home. \n“But proper funding – and consultation – is key to making sure STPs solve instead of exacerbate the problems of England’s health and care system.” \nAn NHS England spokeswoman said: “Rather than just commenting from the sidelines, local health and care leaders and clinicians are coming together to actually try and solve some deep-seated problems by identifying practical ways to improve services. \n“Yes, there are well known pressures and constraints facing the NHS, but for patients’ sake we should obviously all try and make the best of the situation, rather than just stand to one side and say ‘well I wouldn’t start from here’.” \nThe £9.5bn cost was revealed as an analysis by the i newspaper of the 44 STPs suggested that they will lead to the closure of 19 hospitals, including five acute ones. \nAreas where acute hospitals are under threat include Leicestershire and south-west London. The STPs have previously been criticised by the BMA as a stealthy way of cutting NHS services, dressed up as modernisation. \nThe i investigation also found that nearly 3,000 jobs could be lost under proposals to create a “smaller, more agile” workforce. \nOther mooted changes under the plans include cutting prescription costs, rationing care and operations and slashing costs through use of technology, for example, doctors using video links to assess and discharge patients and even “virtual doctors” in an attempt to boost out-of-hospital care.
