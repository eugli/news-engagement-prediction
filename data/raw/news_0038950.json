Representative of The Awaited One Lord Ra Riaz Gohar Shahi. Ambassador of Peace & Man of Valour. Advocate of interfaith harmony. Feb 16 The shrine of the famous Sufi, Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, which was recently attacked. Sufis in Pakistan Under Attack from Islamic Hardliners Sufis are regarded as heretics by followers of Wahhabism and Salafism. The following is a transcript of Younus AlGohar’s speech. There is a new wave of violence in Pakistan. In the last five days, terrorists have carried out eight attacks. Today, there was a horrible attack on a Sufi site: the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalander. The initial figure for the number of people who lost their lives was 40, but now it’s tipping over 70. Sufi Muslims are regarded as heretics by Salafis (such as Taliban, ISIS and Al-Qaeda). After every terrorist attack, government officials, politicians and others condemn the killing. They say, ‘Nothing can divide us. Nothing can scare us.’ However, this is coming from people who are guarded by 13 000 policemen. It is not coming from a man who works in the public to earn his bread and butter every day. A common man [in Pakistan] cannot afford to skip one single day in a week. The day he doesn’t go out and work, his family does not break bread. Someone in Lahore, Pakistan wanted to discuss with me what measures should be taken to ensure these atrocities come to an end. He was upset with the current situation in the country. I am not hopeful that this is going to get any better in the near future. This is not a prediction; this is writing on the wall. When there are bad people out there who are [causing mischief], you need good people also who can stop them. If there are bad people in every single department of the country, starting from the army stretching out to religious seminaries, you can’t help this. The entire nation is corrupt and has been brainwashed. We have been raising the awareness of Wahhabism and its death cult. Once again, I would like to urge to everyone who will either read this article or who will view this video on YouTube to please study the Wahhabi mentality. Study Wahhabism and their fanatic, extremist and absurd tenets. Wahhabis are maladjusted. They cannot coexist with any other religious faction in the country. They think whoever does not practise their understanding of Islam is not a pure Muslim, no matter how vigorous one’s practise of Islam may be. According to them, only those are pure Muslims who are Wahhabis and Salafis. To their mental approach and religious understanding, no other Muslim sect in the entire world is legitimate apart from them. It is not just that Wahhabis do not consider other Muslim sects to be Muslims; they consider all other sects in Islam to be heretics who have no right to live. This is troublesome. I come from a country called Pakistan where the entire nation has lost their sensibility. Whether you talk to a cobbler on the street or the Prime Minister of the country, the level of their religious understanding is the same. Terrorists have carried out a bomb blast at a Sufi shrine. They say to Sufis, ‘If the Sufi is alive (as you believe), why didn’t he come and help you?’ I would like to remind such people of what happened in the Kaaba two years ago, when many hundred people died there due to a crane that broke. God is not dead, so why did God not save those people who were in the House of God? His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi pointed out to us in 2001 that these factions of Wahhabis, like Al-Qaeda, Taliban and others in Pakistan and all over the world, ‘would start bombing the Sufi shrines at one time.’ At that time, 16 years ago, no such untoward incident took place; however what His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi said was spot on. This is exactly what is happening today. A minister from Pakistan issued a statement saying, ‘These terrorists have no religion.’ But [terrorists think] they’re doing it for Islam! Their inspiration is coming from the Koran. The approach of the Pakistani government is to close their eyes and pretend as if nothing is happening; with this approach, nothing is going to change. However, the [Pakistani ministers] enjoy pretending as if nothing is happening, because their lives are not at risk. They are well guarded and protected. They have no fear that they will be blown up by a bomb, or that somebody would kill them. The danger is for the common people, especially those who frequently visit these Sufi shrines in Pakistan. Last year, in November, there was a bomb blast in Balochistan, at Shah Noorani’s shrine. More than 50 people were killed. A few years back in Lahore, there was a bomb blast at Data Sahib’s shrine and many people lost their lives. All these Sufi shrines are being now targeted. A lot of people are asking me, ‘What should be done?’ I tell them that this is going to get worse. This has gone out of proportion. I was discussing with someone today whether declaring Pakistan to be a terrorist state is going to help Pakistani nation — or help humanity rid the world of this wave of terrorism. It is very difficult to see what the aftermath of Pakistan being declared a terrorist state could be. [One thing is clear:] only the people who are being killed will continue to suffer. Of course, not every single Pakistani is a terrorist. A majority of Pakistanis are liberal, moderate Muslims. Most of them are now tired of factions within Islam. I know it because people ask me questions. They’re getting weary of being in this situation where they do think they are Muslims but [other Muslims do not accept them as being so]. Political and religious parties are all busy [working towards] their own interests. Some people use terrorism as a trump card. When the government is about to fall, they use this card to survive politically. [In Pakistan] it is not just about the political survival; the Nawaz Sharif regime is the strongest government in the entire world after Saudi Arabia that harbours terrorists. Nawaz Sharif himself is a Salafist terrorist. The world needs to understand this, especially people who are now striving to establish that Sufis are the followers of the Anti-Christ or Sufis will be killing humanity! Look at what is happening in Pakistan these days. The black flag bearers (ISIS) are killing Sufis and [people striving to defame Sufis] are telling us a story vice versa of what is happening. Sufi Muslims are in fact true Muslims. They respect and believe in the prophets and saints of God. HDE Gohar Shahi said that on the Day of Judgement, many people will be granted salvation simply because they loved and respected or served a prophet or a saint of God. An excerpt from His Divine Eminence’s book, The Religion of God (Divine Love): Abu Dharr Ghaffari said, ‘On the Day of Judgement, as the people recognise the Saints, they will say, “O’ God, I helped him with ablution.” God will reply, “Let him be granted salvation.” Another man will say, “O’ God, I gave him clothes to wear and gave him food to eat.” God will reply, “Let him also be granted salvation.” This is how countless men will find salvation.’ Younus AlGohar is the CEO of Messiah Foundation International.
