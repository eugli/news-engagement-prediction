In fact what happened was a little surprising… Three of the four matches were decided by one decisive victory. \nMatch 1: Ju Wenjun (CHN) 0.5 – 1.5 Tan Zhongyi (CHN) Good concentration requires a good winter coat!

Of course, the heavy favourite had to be Ju Wenjun who had started 2017 with a fantastic result in Gibraltar and a 2600rating. In a similar vein, she had also started the world championship in powerful form although her third-round match to Olga Girya hadn’t been as convincing. \nWGM Tan Zhongyi , probably the world’s highest rated WGM, hadn’t had such an auspicious start, narrowly surviving a hair-raising Armageddon match against European champion Anna Ushenina . On a personal level, the two had played 31 games against each other with Tan defeating Ju in an Armageddon match in 2015. \nThings did not go exactly to plan for Ju in the first round when she was lucky to draw as black in the following position. \nDespite this not being the ideal way to begin, things were not exactly a disaster as Ju had white in the second game and could press for the victory as much as she wanted to. That was the plan but what happened next was entirely unexpected… \nPreparation, preparation, preparation ! \nTan later told the press that she had come to the match with a very specific game plan—she believed that Ju would be looking to beat her in the classical matches. This meant that Tan’s plan would be to provoke her opponent to step out of her comfort zone and force Ju to play as aggressively as possible…It was a risky plan but boy, did it work. \nAlthough Ju Wenjun leaves the tournament, she gets a second shot at becoming world champion, when at the end of 2017 she will challenge the winner of this knockout in a match for the title. \nMatch 2: Anna Muzychuk (UKR) 1.5 -0.5 Antoaneta Stefanova (BUL) Getting ready for their first game Anna Muzychuk (left) Antoaneta Stefanova. | Photo David Llada . \nIt's no big secret that Anna Muzychuk desperately wants to become the new women’s world champion. Whilst Anna's sister Mariya, the 2015 champion, had not been prepared to play in Iran, Anna did not want to let go of her dream. \nAnna has proven to be one of the most excellently prepared participants defeating all her opponents in the classical matches rather comfortably. Facing Muzychuk, was 2004 women’s world champion Antoaneta Stefanova, an experienced match player with a string of world titles to her name. \nThe first game started promisingly in Muzychuk’s favor after Stefanova self-destructed in a level position, putting Muzychuk in an excellent position to qualify for the first time ever into the semi-finals. \nAll or nothing \nNeeding to win on demand is no mean feat and playing with the white pieces, Stefanova pushed hard as she could to reach the following position: \nMatch 3: Alexandra Kosteniuk (RUS) – 1.5-0.5 Ni Shiqun (CHN) Kosteniuk, deep in thought. | Photo David Llada . \nNi Shiqun (remember that name!) had been the complete surprise of the tournament, dispatching all her opponents with relative ease. However, this time her opponent was the 2006 women’s world champion and the 2016 Russian women’s champion Alexandra Kosteniuk. \nKosteniuk, an experienced world championship veteran and combative player knew exactly how to dispatch of her young opponent—holding the easy draw with black and managing to grind out a long win as White. Very professional work by Kosteniuk, who had joked that she had only expected to last until round three. \nMatch 4: Harika Dronavalli (IND) 2.5-1.5 Nana Dzagnidze (GEO) Harika with her biggest fan—her grandmother! | Photo David Llada . \nThe most exciting match up was definitely the fight between the fourth and fifth seeds, GMs Harika Dronavalli and Nana Dzagnidze. Harika had been having a gruelling time of things having participated in three playoffs. It did seem though, that she had stumbled upon some kind of winning formula which was simply put; to win all her white tiebreak games! \nDzagnidze on the other hand had had a very shaky first round but seemed to be picking up her momentum relying on her sharp calculation skills and intense focus. \nHarika, playing white struck first after Dzagnidze opened with a dubious opening: \nDzagnidze duly punched back. \nThis led to a Harika's fourth tie-break, where once again Harika managed to pull off her trademark speciality of winning with White in the tiebreaks! Things looked like they were going to be settled peacefully until this occurred: \nThis win allowed her to accept a draw in a winning position to win the play-off and secure her spot into the next round. \nThe Semi-finals Preview", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:05:13.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
