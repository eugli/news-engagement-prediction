Can it compete against Google's own interpretation of a perfect Android smartphone? Let's find out! Display \nThe Google Pixel has a 5' 1080p AMOLED display with a pixel density of 441 ppi. The HTC U Ultra on the other hand comes with a 5.7' 2K Super LCD 5 screen alongsside a 2.05' secondary display with a 160x1040 resolution, circa the LG V20. \nBoth displays are protected by Gorilla Glass although the Pixel makes do with Gorilla Glass 4 as compared to the Gorilla Glass 5 on the HTC Ultra. \nThe secondary screen on the U Ultra is capable of displaying your top contacts, app shortcuts, event notifications and more. HTC claims that the technology used actually learns with time and evolves according to your usage. The U Ultra is definitely one of the most striking smartphone to be released in a while and is a welcome relief from all the similar looking flagships out there Design \nThe Google Pixel has a striking, albeit extremely polarizing design with a distinctive pane of glass stretching from the camera to below the fingerprint scanner on the rear. \nMade of metal and glass, the smartphone looks and feels premium, especially so in the unusual 'Really Blue' color. The aluminum finish feels good in the hand although the huge bezels are extremely irksome. \nThe U Ultra on the other hand brings with a completely new design language for HTC. Dubbed 'liquid design', the smartphone is made from glass and metal that boasts of an all-around symmetrical bending that reflects light differently when viewed at different angles. \nThe U Ultra in fact seems like an evolution of the Google Pixel's design which is not very surprising considering HTC manufactures the device for Google. The U Ultra also comes in three striking colors - Brilliant Black, Cosmetic Pink and Sapphire Blue. \nThe U Ultra is definitely one of the most striking smartphone to be released in a while and is a welcome relief from all the similar looking flagships out there. While the Pixel also boasts of a unique design, the HTC clearly wins this round with its distinctive design choices.

It is powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor paired with 4GB RAM, 64GB of internal storage and a 3,000mAh battery. Both smartphones come with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box and their own set of special tweaks and features which we will talk about later on in the article. \nWhere the HTC U Ultra pulls ahead of the Google Pixel is the fact the Ultra supports microSD cards of upto 2TB while the Pixel doesn't come with expandable storage at all. This will be an impotant consideration for media junkies who like to store a lot of photos and videos on their device. The Pixel however does come with unlimited photo/video backup via Google Drive. Cameras \nOn the imaging front, the Google Pixel comes with a 12MP rear camera with phase detection auto-focus, an aperture of f/2.0, electronic image stabilisation and a sensor size of 1/3.2\". On the front, there is an 8MP sensor with a f/2.0 aperture for selfies. \nWhile, DxOMark - an industry standard camera test claims the camera on the Pixel performs better than the one the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, our tests show that the camera is as good or maybe a little inferior to the two. \nThe HTC U Ultra on the other hand comes with a 12MP (UltraPixel) rear camera with optical image stabilisation, phase detection auto focus, a dual-tone flash and an aperture of f/1.8. On the front, there is an 16MP camera. \nOne area where the U Ultra clearly trumps the Pixel is the inclusion of optical image stabilisation and dual-tone flash which the Pixel lacks. When it comes to actual image quality, we will have to reserve judgement till we get to extensively review the device. Other features \nGoogle Pixel: \nGoogle Assistant \nThe Google Pixel comes with Google Assistant, Google's answer to the Siris and Cortanas of the world. Assistant builds upon Google Now's foundation but takes things up several notches. \nGoogle Assistant can be used to open apps, text someone, play/pause music, call your friends, post a tweet, make movie reservations and much more. Where it pulls ahead of both Siri and Cortana is the fact that Assistant is extremely smart. The more you use it, the more useful it will become. \nThanks to Android's open nature, Google Assistant is open to all applications, allowing any developer to make use of Assistant and all of its capabilities. \nUnlimited photo/video storage \nGoogle offers Pixel owners unlimited backups of all their photos and videos to Google Photos for life in high resolution without any compression. Users can also backup 4K videos to the cloud. \nPixel also comes with a feature called 'Smart Storage' which automatically backs up photos/videos to the cloud whenever your device storage becomes low. \nPixel launcher \nThe Pixel launcher is exclusive to Pixel smartphones and brings with it an all new app launcher and rounded app icons. It also replaces Google Now with Google Assistant. \n24/7 customer support \nPixel owners get 24/7 text and voice based customer support along with a screen sharing service through which tech-support can easily identify and diagnose problems. \nHTC U Ultra: \nSense Companion \nThe U Ultra comes with HTC's own version of an AI based assistant dubbed 'Sense Companion' which the company claims \"isn't only about machine learning, but also an extension of you, the user\". Where the HTC U Ultra pulls ahead of the Google Pixel is the fact the Ultra supports microSD cards of upto 2TB while the Pixel doesn't come with expandable storage at all. \nThe Sense Companion \"can suggest that you dress warmer and leave a little earlier for work if snow is forecast; remind you to take a power bank on longer trips; and even recommend a restaurant when you're away for the weekend and then book seats for you2. Best of all, it's made to evolve and get to know you better over time,\" HTC adds. \nTo make the phones more AI-friendly, HTC has incorporated four always-on low-power microphones inside them, so they can respond to every command. The U Ultra and the U Play also come with a one-of-its-kind biometric voice unlock and control mechanism through which users can securely unlock their phone without even interacting with it. \nWhile the feature looks extremely promising, it will not come pre installed in the U Ultra and will be made available sometime in early 2017 via a software update.

Period. \nFaisal Siddiqui, president of HTC South Asia explains how the U Ultra's Sense companion is better than Google Pixel's Google Assistant: \n\"It is different (and in a way better than the Google Assistant on-board the Pixel phone) because it's not just about AI. The Google Assistant is essentially cloud behaviour. Here, the phone is learning from your unique personal behaviour. The experience is much more personalised as opposed to learning from an aggregate behaviour in the cloud\" \nAudio enhancements \nThe U Ultra and the U Play also come with sonar-based audio system -- called U-Sonic -- over headphones that is claimed to deliver true sound that is also capable of adapting to the user. Both the phones come without a regular 3.5mm audio jack and have a single USB Type-C out for charging, data syncing and high-res audio. HTC U Sonic, however, works only with compatible USB-C headphones. The U Ultra, in addition, also supports BoomSound Hi-Fi sound technology. Price/Verdict \nThe HTC U Ultra comes in only one variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage for Rs 59,990 .The Google Pixel on the other hand comes in two variants - one with 32GB of internal storage for Rs 57,000 and one with 128GB for Rs 66,000. \nWhile we are yet to review the HTC U Ultra extensively, the U Ultra looks to be an evolution of the Google Pixel. It has a better screen, expandable storage, the same processor and RAM and also comes with a lot of neat tricks up its sleeve. \nThe Google Pixel comes with stock Android and the very fact that it is Google's interpretation of what an Android phone should be like will sway many buyers over in its favour.
