The girls have been in hospital since Thursday since contracting the virus. Photo: Facebook \n\"It is heart-breaking and extremely scary to see them like this, I just sit next to their beds every day staring at the monitors,\" Ms Wallis told the Daily Mail. Ms Wallis took to Facebook to warn people not to go near babies when they have a cold. Photos: Facebook \nHarper, the smaller twin fell ill first, but soon both babies were sick and were admitted to hospital on Thursday. \n\"At this stage I knew why they were sick – I had heard of RSV - but didn't realise how bad it could be or that it would just look like a common cold.\" Close Spike in Queensland parechovirus cases UP NEXT VIDEO Spike in Queensland parechovirus cases \nThe girls were born five weeks premature and Ms Wallis said she explained to family and friends that even a minor illness could harm them and she told them not to come over if they were sick. \n\"I just can't believe someone decided they would be able to risk it with my babies. Now they could die.\" The babies had started smiling and chattering before they got sick, their mum has said. Photo: Facebook \nBoth of the babies are being fed by tubes, but for now the larger twin, Harlow, doesn't require oxygen but that could change. \n\"I can't give them anything orally because they just aren't coping,\" she said. \n\"Every time we hold them for too long all of the alarms go off, it is really scary.\" The mum shared her frustration in a Facebook post. \nShe said it is distressing how the girls have changed since they have gotten sick, saying that they had started \"smiling and chattering\" before they got sick and were \"loud, demanding babies\" but now the \"just lay there\". \nHer sons, one aged three and aged six, don't really understand what's going on and are \"pretty scared about it\", she said. \n\"I am feeling very stretched about it – I can't leave the hospital and my girls to be with my other two children because the twins need me. But it is heart-breaking because my boys need me as well. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T06:09:27.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
