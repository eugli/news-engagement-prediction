Today they revealed their eighth collaboration at the Miami boat show: It's a 50-foot boat called the Marauder AMG, and the companies claim it was inspired by the Mercedes-AMG GT R. While there are some tenuous connections to the car here, the Marauder AMG certainly delivers on AMG performance and looks.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo Let's start with performance. This Marauder uses quite a bit of carbon fiber, not unlike its road-going inspiration. Among the parts given the woven carbon treatment are the cockpit, consoles, and engine cover. In addition to lightweight components, the boat features two potent V8s, but not from Mercedes-AMG. The engines are double-overhead-cam V8s from Mercury Racing. Each makes 1,350 horsepower on 91 octane gas. Throw some race gas in and they'll each make 1,550 hp, for a combined output of 3,100.\nThe other connection to the AMG GT R is of course the paint scheme. In fact, this is the part of the boat that is most closely connected to the German automaker. The chief design officer for Daimler AG designed the graphics, which use the Green Hell Magno color from the GT R. The seat upholstery was also done by AMG Performance Studio.\nIf you're interested in picking one up, you'll need quite a bit of cash. We know this because as far as pricing is concerned, it's a literal case of, \"If you have to ask, you can't afford it.\" The exact words used in the press release are, \"The price of this one-of-a-kind boat from the Cigarette Racing Team is available upon request.\" So check your fancy Swiss bank account and call up Cigarette Racing Team if you're feeling flush and want a fast boat.\nRelated Video\nClick to expand Replay Video 7 Google Maps tricks only power users know about A video looking at some of the cool Google Maps features that you may not know about.
