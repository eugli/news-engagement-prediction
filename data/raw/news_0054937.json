There are some great phones you can buy under Rs 10,000 that can handle majority of the apps and games well. \nBut everyone doesn't want to change their smartphone every few years. Besides, there will be lower-range smartphones still, running on slower data connection speeds that if catered with optimized apps would run almost as seamless. Facebook Lite was one such app launched in 2015, and now Microsoft has made a similar version of its video calling app Skype. Also Read: Google, Microsoft agree to crack down on internet piracy \nThe Skype Lite app is the optimized version of the actual Skype app and is available for free download on the Android Play store.The app is \"Made for India\" in the Microsoft's research and development center in Hyderabad and will be available for download only in India for now. \nThe company says the new Skype Lite app will provide better experience for its free video and audio calling service even at lower connections speeds of 3G and 2G. Skype Lite app supports seven Indian languages including Gujarati, Bengali, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu. \nHow does it work? \nSkype Lite is a 13MB app that has features built-in to conserve data usage. So even if you have 4G connection but speeds drop to 3G or 2G due to various network issues, the app will switch automatically to lower-resolution video. \nLower resolution video not only needs less data, but needs less of processing power that will not create problems for a lower-end handset. The app also records the amount of data used during the calls. \nBut when the phone is connected to Wi-Fi, the app will automatically switch the video stream to high-definition for a better calling experience. \nMicrosoft has also used the artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithm that learns with time to differentiate between important and junk messages as you use the app. It segregates all messages into three categories -- normal text messages, Skype messages and promotional texts. \nOther announcements made at the \"Future Decoded\" event -- Microsoft's two-day conference relating to current technology and business -- includes the Sangam project and the launch of Linkdin Lite app. \nSkype + Aadhar \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella also announced the project Sangam at the \"Future Decoded\" event. Under the project, Microsoft plans to integrate Aadhar identification with its services for their extended use. \n\"The company will allow people to enroll through Aadhaar cards and later utilise LinkedIn to manage their profiles,\" Nadella said. It will help the government not only train but also assist people get jobs via professional networking website owned by Microsoft. Also Read: Project Sangam to skill, employ people in India: Nadella \nMicrosoft also introduced this feature on the Skype app. You can send a request to the caller for identification of their Aadhar ID. If accepted, the caller will receive an OTP code on their phone which will verify their identity. This can be used by an employer or government agencies or in other use cases. \nThough WhatsApp also offers video calling, Microsoft is looking to offer something extra as the new announcements point out. \"What we were seeing is that people were aware of Skype, they were our users, but they were dropping off\", said Nadella. \"With Skype Lite, this might take a lot of users away from Skype, but they're still our users\" he said.
