For the cast of men and women including Lineisy Montero, Kiki Willems, and Amber Witcomb—no strangers to the selfie, it’s worth noting—Rowe dreamed up hyper-natural makeup best experienced in real life. “This is realistic makeup for the everyday woman,” she explained, with a swift comb of the brows and a dash of highlighter on the high planes of the face for a glowing complexion—no filter necessary. There is, however, a touch of contouring going on, but not where you would expect it. Rowe wielded from her kit Burberry’s new Lip Colour Contour that launches today in the spirit of the “see-now-buy-now” ethos of the fashion collection. “It’s different to lipstick,” she said of the nude, tonal shades that “make the mouth look fuller by adding a soft shadow to the lip line.” True to form, as she applied the contour on model Molly Smith, who sat in her chair, lips immediately looked a little plumper, suddenly more sensuous. And, just like that, enter the lip product you never knew you needed but really shouldn’t be without. It might be a no-selfie look, but lips like these are worthy of just a quick snap.
