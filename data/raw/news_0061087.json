Taj Gibson (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 3:33 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 3:33 p.m. ET \nThere was a lot of hype surrounding this year's NBA trade deadline as big-name players such as Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Derrick Rose and others were brought up in rumors. But as the deadline came and went, there wasn't quite as much excitement as fans had hoped. \nWhile there wasn't the huge blockbuster trade people were waiting on, there were deals made. A lot of them were minor, but could play an important role down the road due to cap space. \nBelow is a roundup of all the moves made during the 2017 NBA trade deadline. Thunder trade with Bulls \nOklahoma City receives: Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott, 2018 second-round pick \nChicago receives: Anthony Morrow, Cameron Payne, Joffrey Lauvergne \nThis trade, as reported by The Vertica l, helps Oklahoma City add more pieces around Russell Westbrook for a late-season playoff push. Chicago's addition of Payne just adds to a crowded guard position that includes Dwyane Wade, Rajon Rondo, Michael Carter-Williams and Jerian Grant. \nLauvergne is averaging 5.7 points while Morrow is averaging 5.8 points. 76ers trade with Mavs \nPhiladelphia receives: Andrew Bogut, Justin Anderson, 2018 first-round draft pick \nDallas receives: Nerlens Noel \nThe Mavs get the player they've wanted for a while. This also clears up Philadelphia's problem of having too many big men on the roster, as the Sixers initially were shopping around Jahlil Okafor. Philly will most likely buyout Bogut's contract, making him a free agent, although under NBA rules he wouldn't be allowed to rejoin the Warriors. Raptors trade with Suns \nToronto receives: P.J. Tucker \nPhoenix receives: Jared Sullinger, 2017 and 2018 second-round draft picks \nThis trade, as reported by The Vertical , gets Sullinger back to the general manager who had a part in drafting him while at Boston. Rockets trade K.J. McDaniels to Nets \nThere are no other parts to this trade as it's a simple cash dump for Houston. The move clears up $3.3 million in cap space for the Rockets which they can use to potentially buy out another player's contract. NBA Trade Roundup 2017 \nThe rest of the deals made from Thursday are below. \nLakers trade Marcelo Huertas to Rockets for Tyler Ennis (Houston is expected to waive Huertas). \nNuggets trade protected second-round pick to Bucks for Roy Hibbert. \nHawks trade Mike Scott to Suns for cash.
