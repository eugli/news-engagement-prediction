(AP Photo) NEW DELHI: India's Davis Cup team gave its non-playing captain Anand Amritraj a perfect gift in his final tie in charge as the hosts defeated New Zealand 3-1 in the first round of the Asia-Oceania Group I in Pune on Sunday. In the first reverse singles match on the third day of the tie, young Ramkumar Ramanathan outclassed Finn Tearney 7-5, 6-1, 6-0 in two hours and four minutes to seal the contest for India. India went into the final day with a lead of 2-1 after winning both the singles matches on Friday. New Zealand kept themselves alive by winning the doubles tie on Saturday, when Kiwi pair Artem Sitak and Michael Venus got better of Indian pair Leander Paes and Vishnu Vardhan 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (8-6), 6-3 in a contest that lasted two-and-half hours. The defeat also dented Paes' bid to win a world record 43rd Davis Cup doubles match. India will face Uzbekistan in the second round, scheduled for 7-9 April 2017. MORE TO FOLLOW...
