We talked foreign policy.\" \"He's an intelligence guy; how could he not know that every word...is being taped?\" Elliot Abrams on Michael Flynn https://t.co/UD5f8jSBI4 \n— OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) February 14, 2017 He said Trump told him Tillerson wanted him for the post, and when the meeting was over, he assumed everything was fine. But then he found out Trump had rejected him. \"Somebody, I think, put in front of the President, some of the things I'd said last year and perhaps riled him up,\" Abrams said. Trump nixes Elliott Abrams for State Department job Read More Abrams was a former official under President Ronald Reagan. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanors stemming from the Iran-Contra affair and was pardoned by President George H.W. Bush. He went on to serve as deputy national security adviser for President George W. Bush, where he advocated for the Iraq War. Given Abrams' past experiences and positions, he may have found himself strongly at odds with the Trump White House. The President made opposition to major foreign interventions a mainstay of his campaign and chief strategist Steve Bannon has a documented opposition to neoconservatives like Abrams.

Like Trump, Tillerson has no prior experience in government. Sources told CNN that Abrams' failure to secure a prominent spot in the administration was due to his past criticisms of the man who now occupies the Oval Office. In May, Abrams wrote in the neoconservative Weekly Standard that Trump was \"someone who cannot win and should not be president of the United States.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:54:31.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
