STEAMY. 🔥 🔥 🔥 Minou Clark Associate Editor of News and Emerging Platforms, The Huffington Post \nGird your loins, people. This is not for the faint of heart. \nDuring the winter finale of “ Teen Wolf ,” things got hella steamy, and now life will never be the same. \nStiles (Dylan O’Brien) and Lydia (Holland Roden) pretty much declared their love for each other with the best make-out scene in the history of make-out scenes. Seriously, just look at this chemistry. We’re definitely feeling the love. — JUST STYDIA (@clemstilinski) February 1, 2017 \nSorry, did you miss that? Let’s take another look. THEY KISS WITH SO MUCH PASSION. IM.... 😭😭😭 #TeenWolf #Stydia pic.twitter.com/92tjmVfaoZ \nIt’s no surprise “Teen Wolf” fans had a collective meltdown over this romance overload. It’s just too much to handle.
