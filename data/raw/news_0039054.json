Bayern v Arsenal ratings \nI t is an example and mentality that Arsenal can ill-afford to lose from their squad next season. \nSanchez is understood to want £250,000-a-week to sign a new contract and, if that means offering Mesut Ozil less and risks losing the German, so be it. Ozil is sometimes influential but Sanchez is utterly vital. Arsenal selection played into Bayern's hands \nI t is hard to think of a better right-sided partnership in football than Philipp Lahm and Arjen Robben and so the decision to counter them with Alexi Iwobi and Kieran Gibbs instantly felt fraught with danger. \nNacho Monreal and Danny Welbeck would have provided more defensive security and big-game experience. FC Bayern vs Arsenal shots on goal \nB ayern quickly targeted that area and Robben duly cut inside and smashed an unstoppable shot into the top corner. \nIt was a brilliant finish but Gibbs was hardly helped by the midfield cover. Francis Coquelin backed away and, with Arsene Wenger sticking to his usual 4-2-3-1 formation, Arsenal failed to sufficiently pressurise Bayern in possession. FC Bayern 1 - 0 Arsenal (Arjen Robben, 11 min) Lack of physicality (and height) again critical \nJ ust as against Chelsea, Arsenal looked physically inferior at the critical moments . Laurent Koscielny’s injury seemed to destroy their defensive confidence and they were then bullied by Robert Lewandowski during a truly torrid 10 minute period that reflected the very deepest flaws of Arsene Wenger’s team over the past decade. FC Bayern vs Arsenal shots on goal \nG abriel’s arrival next to Shkodran Mustafi coincided with defensive panic and, while little direct blame could be attributed to David Ospina, might the presence of Petr Cech have steadied them? \nThey could certainly have done with Olivier Giroud – as much for defensive set-pieces as an attacking outlet – and more should have been done to potentially get Per Mertesacker match ready for Lewandowski’s aerial threat.

His run beyond the Arsenal defence for Bayern’s third was probably the decisive moment in the tie and, while fortuitous with the fourth, it was still a well-controlled strike into a crowded penalty area. Thiago Alcantara shines for Bayern Credit: REUTERS What Arsenal must do next \nT hey must ensure that such a severe disappointment does not filter into the rest of the season. Sutton United on an artificial pitch is just about the biggest contrast they could now face and Wenger must take no chances in his team selection. FC Bayern vs Arsenal What Bayern must do next \nR esults have been solid enough but there has been disquiet over performances. This, however, could act as a springboard for their season. The all-round quality is clear and they now stand with Real Madrid as the obvious Champions League favourites.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:16:44.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
