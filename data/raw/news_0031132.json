The company has testing for several years to determine the best method to deliver to customers in the future. \nThe patent suggests Amazon is considering keeping its drones high above customers' homes, an approach that couldbe more efficient and safe.In the document, Amazon said that landing a drone takes more time and energy than releasing a package from high in the sky. If Amazon's drones don't land in yards, this prevents potentially dangerous collisions between the drones and any people, pets or objects in a customer's yard. \nRelated: Amazon makes its first drone delivery in Britain \nThe patent also describes how Amazon's drones would use magnets, parachutes or spring coils to release the delivery while in mid-flight. Once the package is released, the drone would then monitor the descending box to make sure it's dropping properly onto the desired landing patch. \nFor example, wind could potentially blow a package into a balcony, power line or tree. To solve this, Amazon's drones would radio a message to an off-course package, instructing it to deploy a parachute, compressed air canister or landing flap. \nIt's unclear when Amazon will launch drone delivery in the United States. Its current plan, which calls for automated drones flying without the direct supervision of a human, isn't legal today. This month Amazon said in a Super Bowl ad that Prime Air would launch soon, but offered no additional details. Amazon is conducting some tests overseas. Doritos. Drones. Drama. The perfect recipe for the big game. #JustAsk Alexa #SB51 pic.twitter.com/5sMvM5O6mU â€” Amazon Echo (@amazonecho) February 6, 2017 \nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the patent awarded Tuesday. \nCompetitors such as Google have shown off similar plans, in which a package is dropped from the sky. Late last year the drone delivery firm Flirtey completed an automated drone trial with 77 packages deliveredfrom a 7-Eleven in Reno, Nevada. The flights were legal because Flirtey had a human supervise the flights, which were completed within a mile of the 7-Eleven. After extensive testing, Flirtey said it had found a way to drop a Slurpee without spilling a single sip.
