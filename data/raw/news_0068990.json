Even if it’s punctuated with “BYE BITCH” on social media. \nIt’s hard to pick an MVP of this championship-caliber effort. The one-timer girl at the doorway is the clear frontrunner, but the poor soul forced to share a bathroom with the rat to flush it out certainly had the least pleasant role. \nSo...co-MVPs? \nThe video doesn’t really highlight the individuals so much as it does the teamwork and strategy, but thanks to their newfound viral fame, we can put faces to these once-anonymous heroes: Facebook Recently on GOOD Sports   I Don’t Know A Thing About Soccer.
