Your success is our success,” Pence said. “And ultimately, we walk into the future together.” \nREAD MORE: Read the full transcript of Donald Trump’s wide-ranging press conference \nMerkel conceded room for improvement in multilateral structures, saying that in many places they are not efficient enough. \n“I am firmly convinced that it is worth fighting for our common international multilateral structures, but we must improve them in many places,” she said. \nWATCH: Trudeau: Canada contributes to NATO in more ways than just money \nMerkel reiterated that Germany is committed to the official NATO goal of putting 2 per cent of gross domestic product into defence spending — Germany currently contributes 1.3 per cent. \n“We will do everything we can in order to fulfil this commitment,” she said. “But let me add, however, that I believe while NATO is very much in the European interest, it’s also in the American interest — it’s a very strong alliance where we are united together.” \nPence added bluntly that the U.S. expected that all NATO members would meet the 2 per cent goal. \n“Europe’s defence requires your commitment as much as ours,” he said. \nEuropeans have also worried about Trump’s enthusiastic endorsement of the British “Brexit,” or decision to leave the European Union. Pence did not mention the EU, but did say that the U.S. was on a path of “friendship with Europe and a strong North Atlantic alliance.” \nWATCH: Justin Trudeau pushes back against protectionist policy in European Parliament address \nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg added in an address following Merkel and Pence that in his mind, NATO and the EU defence complement one another. \n“A strong Europe cannot mean Europe alone, just as I don’t believe ‘America first’ means America alone,” he said. \nMerkel, who met with Pence one-on-one following their addresses, acknowledged that Europeans couldn’t fight global issues like Islamic extremist terrorism alone, saying “we need the military power of the United States.” \nShe renewed a call for Islamic religious authorities to speak “clear words on the demarcation of peaceful Islam and terrorism in the name of Islam.” \nMerkel pledged to continue working for better relations with Russia, but also stressed the importance of sticking to the 2015 agreement she helped broker in Minsk, Belarus, aimed at ending fighting in eastern Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian separatists. \n“The Minsk agreement is the only thing we have at the moment to move forward talks and the possibility of solving the problems,” she said. “When we don’t have anything else, I am against throwing something away that may still carry hope.” © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T15:45:19.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
