Upset by the bullies' taunts, he began to cry and yell. \"I was like, 'I didn't do anything to you!'\" he recalled. \nWhen a school resource officer at George Melcher Elementary found Kalyb crying and screaming in the classroom, he asked Kalyb to come with him. Out in the hallway, Kalyb, still crying, refused to follow the officer. \nAccording to the incident report , the officer told Kalyb to \"calm down\" and tried to assure him \"he wasn't in trouble,\" but for Kalyb, it didn't feel that way. \n\"It was not okay,\" Kalyb, now 10 years old, said. \"I was very mad.\" \nKalyb kept trying to walk away from the officer, and got more upset the farther they walked. The officer then handcuffed the 50-pound, four-foot boy and marched him to the principal's office. According to the incident report, the officer said he cuffed the boy, who \"appeared to be out of control,\" to keep him from hurting himself. Kalyb Wiley-Primm was handcuffed while in the second grade at a Kansas City, Missouri school. NBC News \nDue in part to tragic school shootings like the Columbine massacre, police and security officers are now a regular presence at schools. But the handcuffing of Kalyb Wiley-Primm is one of many incidents across the country that have led to calls to examine the role that police play in schools, and change how discipline is meted out — particularly to minority students and students with disabilities. \nHow Does Your School District Compare? Click Here to Find Out \nThe NBC News Investigative Unit and the NBC-owned stations analyzed data collected from all public schools in the nation by the U.S. Department of Education. Called the Civil Rights Data Collection , every two years all public school districts are required to report to the Education Department on wide-ranging topics from suspensions and expulsions to arrests and referrals of students to law enforcement. Districts are also required to break down data by race and disability. \nNBC News crunched the numbers from the 2013-2014 school year, the most recent data available. The analysis found that nationally, black students, like Kalyb, and students with disabilities are suspended, expelled, arrested and referred to police at rates disproportionately higher than their white and non-disabled peers. \nExaminations of police and court records also found that law enforcement became involved with students for minor discipline issues. Toi Hutchinson, an Illinois state senator, says that minor discipline issues in school can mean counseling for kids -- or juvenile detention. NBC News \n\"Certain kids get counseling,\" said Illinois State Senator Toi Hutchinson, who successfully i ntroduced a bill in the legislature requiring the state Board of Education to make discipline data public. It also requires districts to address significant disparities in discipline. \"Certain kids get wraparound services. Other kids get juvenile detention.\" \n\"I think what you're seeing is data across the country to say that instances like [Kalyb's] are not anomalies,\" Hutchinson added. \"We Don't Want to Arrest. We're Here for Safety\" \nForty-three percent of public schools in the United States now have some kind of security personnel present at school at least once a week. Districts employ school resource officers with a variety of backgrounds — sometimes off-duty or retired police officers. Districts also employ school security personnel who are not sworn law enforcement officers, like the one who handcuffed Kalyb Wiley-Primm. \nHolly Zornes, who works at a high school not far from Kalyb's school in Kansas City, is a police officer. She patrols the halls in a bulletproof vest, carrying cuffs and a loaded gun. \nHowever, she says her mission is not to arrest students. \"We as police officers don't want to handcuff a child,\" she said, \"We don't want to arrest. We're here for safety.\" Police officer Holly Zornes works at a high school in Kansas City, Missouri. NBC News \nDr. Mark Bedell, the new superintendent of Kansas City Schools, says the presence of police in schools is vital. \n\"We know a lot of terrible things have been happening in schools around the country with people just intruding. And we've had mass shootings.\" \nHe says that some districts have used officers to do the jobs of principals and assistant principals in enforcing discipline. The key, he says, is clearly defining the officers' role. \nSaid Bedell, \"Their job is to ensure that we have a safe learning environment, and that our kids are protected from imminent harm. Period.\" \nLast fall, then-Education Secretary John King, Jr. posted a letter on-line emphasizing that point, reminding school districts that school resource officers should have \"no role in administering school discipline.\" \nCurrently, the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights has over 450 open investigations for discrimination on the basis of race, sex, disability and national origin in the administration of discipline in schools. \n\"I am concerned about the potential for violations of students' civil rights and unnecessary citations or arrests of students in schools, all of which can lead to the unnecessary and harmful introduction of children and young adults into a school-to-prison pipeline ,\" King wrote. \nOnce a child enters the juvenile justice system, said Diane Smith Howard, senior staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, an advocacy group for people with disabilities, their image of themselves starts to change. \"Kids start to identify. 'I'm a criminal. I'm a delinquent.' It sends a really strong message that you don't belong here at school.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T15:47:47.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
