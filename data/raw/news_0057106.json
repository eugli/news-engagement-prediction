Those drinks, which cost between $2.69 and $4, will be discounted to $2 for a limited time. \nMcDonald's is cutting prices to try and drive customer traffic to its restaurants. \nVisits to the chain's US restaurants dropped 2.1% in 2016, despite McDonald's rollout of a new McPick 2 value menu early last year that offered bundled value meals for between $2 and $4. \nThe fast-food chain has been facing stiff competition from other chains that have also been cutting prices and offering bundled value meals. \nMcDonald's is also competing in a tough overall market with steadily declining grocery prices encouraging more people to eat at home. \nMcDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook said last month that driving customer traffic with discounts and promotions would be the company's main focus this year. \n\"You can expect us to be more competitive on the value end this year,\" Easterbrook said on a call with analysts in January.
