The push to take the airport, which has been spearheaded by the Iraqi Federal Police, is a promising start for what is expected to be a difficult and bloody fight to evict the group from the city, the country’s second largest. “They are most of the way through the airfield,” said Brig. Gen. Matt Isler, a senior United States Air Force officer in the American-led coalition. It took Iraqi forces 100 days to seize the eastern half of the city, an operation that led to significant Iraqi casualties. Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of the United States Central Command who arrived in Baghdad on Thursday, said that about 500 Iraqi military personnel were killed and about 3,000 wounded in that operation. After taking the eastern portion of the city in recent weeks, Iraqi forces paused to strategize about how to best reclaim the western half. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story One decision was to resume their offensive and take the rest of the city on multiple axes so that the Islamic State would find it difficult to coordinate its defenses. The new Iraqi offensive was proceeded by a powerful series of airstrikes against 33 targets, including headquarters where commanders from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, were believed to be operating. The group first conquered the city in 2014, but has consistently lost ground to Iraqi forces backed by coalition air support. One bombing attack was directed at a five story medical center in west Mosul that an American official said had been turned into an ISIS command center. Militants often use hospitals, schools and religious buildings, in the hopes that coalition forces would be reluctant to bomb them. In this instance, American officials said they determined that no civilians were present. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
