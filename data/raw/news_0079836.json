Each battalion has about 1,000 constables. \n\nThe recruits are undergoing special training in the Koramangala KSRP division and will be deployed in Bengaluru and Belagavi after completion in December. “To strengthen the new KSRP women's wing, the department is giving them special training in karate and kung fu,“ said Bhaskar Rao, Additional Director General of Police, KSRP . \n\nThey are also being trained to use rifles, tear-gas crowds, use wireless communication devices and on computers, he said. The trigger for this all women squad was the garment workers protest and the Cauvery riots of last year. In April, thousands of garment workers, many of them women, rioted and blocked highways to protest against the Union government's proposed amendments to provident fund withdrawal norms. Visuals of male police lathi-charging at women protesters went viral and KSRP had to seek help from the women's wings of other paramilitary forces. \n\n“Appointing women to the KSRP was overdue,“ said former state police chief ST Ramesh. “There should not be any differentiation in handling cases. Both men and women police should be able to handle both men and women related cases.“  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:12:30.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
