Blue Ivy Carter had a front-row seat at the Grammys Sunday night, and the five-year-old made the most of it. She sat with her father, Jay Z , and grandmother, Tina Knowles , while her mother (you know, Beyoncé ) performed and accepted an award. Blue didn’t really sit still, though. She had a night that even her Grammy-award-winning mom might envy. Blue’s ruffle-collared suit, which might be a tribute to the late Prince , was the second little pop of pink in the room. ScHoolboy Q’s daughter Joy (a couple of years Blue’s senior), also made a statement with her tailored choice. Her look was accompanied by what appeared to be this $1,895 Gucci cat purse . Blue’s pink threads helped her stand out, sure, but the ability to insert herself in every frame (and her infectious excitement) made her a true highlight of the night.
