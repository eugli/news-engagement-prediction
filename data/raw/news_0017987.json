The Ritz? Savoy? Or would you choose Nando's? \nCanadian rap superstar Drake has proved he's a thoroughly down-to-earth young chap by ordering a post-concert meal from the popular chicken chain on Thursday night in Leeds. \nBut he didn't do it by halves, spending more than £500 on his order. That's surely an extra cheeky Nando's. \nSomeone who seemingly works at the chain posted a photograph of the till screen on to Twitter showing the bill totalling £534.55. \nThat's a lot of chicken and was probably ordered to feed what is undoubtedly a huge entourage. \nUnfortunately it did mean that other Nando's customers had their orders held up a bit. \nProbably not a problem they expected when they headed out for their Peri-Peri fix. Nando's decided to get in on the banter \nBut it seems it was more like Medium-line Wing. A source told the Daily Mail that Drake ordered \"320 medium wings, 120 Lemon & Herb wings, 25 medium chicken wraps, 25 plain chicken wraps and eight medium 1/2 chickens.\" \nThat's nothing above medium spice, then. We thought you could handle the heat, Drake? \nAccording to the Yorkshire Evening Post, Drake is thought to have arrived at Leeds Bradford Airport by private jet for his Boy Meets World tour dates in the city. \nNo expenses spared for Drake. \nHis friend arrived to pick up the whopping amount of chicken at about 10.30pm.
