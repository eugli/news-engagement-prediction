It is unbelievable,\" said the Italian, whose side sit one place above the bottom three with 13 matches of the season remaining. \n\"We started well, but their first two shots on goal are goals. It is very difficult to come back from that. It is unbelievable, this season. \n\"We have two problems: conceding goals and not scoring. We have to speak together to find the solutions. It is not possible to continue in this way.\" ALSO READ: Burnley's Brady checks Chelsea charge after a 1-1 draw \nRanieri was backed by Leicester's Thai owners King Power prior to Sunday's game and while he conceded Swansea showed more appetite for battle, he believes fortune is currently working against his team. \n\"The machine is not broken, but when you don't play at a maximum level, it is a difficult battle. They were more determined than us, that's the truth,\" he said. \n\"We stay together. We work very well in training, but we need a little luck to move our confidence. I am very strong, very confident. I believe in everything. \n\"It just takes the right moment to turn this around.\" \nRanieri now faces mounting speculation about his future, but Leicester midfielder Danny Drinkwater said the players remained firmly behind the 65-year-old Italian. \n\"It's down to us on the pitch what happens. The manager has our support and we have his support,\" Drinkwater told Sky Sports. \n\"It's about time we showed that belief and push ourselves a bit more.\" \nRanieri, meanwhile, hinted in his post-match press conference that he had shown too much faith in last season's title heroes and would need to shake up his starting XI. \nLeicester visit third-tier Millwall in the FA Cup fifth round next weekend before travelling to Sevilla for the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie the following Wednesday. \nThey are not in league action again until a home game with Liverpool on February 27.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:47:14.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
