They will see dresses and gowns, they will be on people,\" Kimmel said. \"They don't know it but the moment they open the door, they're going to be on live TV and we're going to surprise them.\"And what a surprise it was! Kimmel told the crew to turn off the lights and instructed the audience members to yell, \"Mahershala!\" when the lights turned back on.At the end of a short countdown, the stunned visitors entered the room. Most were recording with their cellphones as the spotlight followed them across the front of the stage.Kimmel introduced a man named Gary from Chicago to Nicole Kidman, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.

Her reply: \"That man over there,\" as she pointed directly at Denzel Washington.Washington promptly got up from his seat, approached the soon-to-be newlyweds, grab their hands and pronounced them \"husband and wife.\"\"He's Denzel, so it's legal,\" Kimmel said.Kimmel then pointed out Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux. Kimmel urged Aniston to \"give them something from your purse\" as a wedding gift.
