Picks - Picks + MWC2017 - MWC2017 + Well, well, the LG G6 is out and wow, is it an impressive device! A 5.7-inch screen stuck inside a body that's actually shorter and narrower than the 5.3-inch LG G5 ? That's incredible! No camera bump? Awesome! A new 2:1 screen that has software optimizations to make use of the weird ratio? Great! This year around, LG really put an effort into developing unique features that actually look and feel at least semi-useful, instead of ones that leave a gimmicky taste, and we are excited to see how the G6 does when it hits the market.That said, there's also room for nit-picking, and we can see a few things that could've made the LG G6 even more awesome, even if it's for your niche poweruser. Check out our ideas below and feel free to voice your thoughts on the device in the comments below! Features that could've made the G6 better ZOOM PREVIEW LOADING + image Stereo speakers are slowly becoming a more desirable feature in smartphones. In the past, HTC and Sony were the only major manufacturers to build them into their phones, but Apple has now also joined in. This puts enormous pressure on other phone-slingers to compete and we really do feel that 2017 smartphones should have loud, high-quality, dual-firing speakers in order to shine. Stereo speakers image LG has been adding high-quality DAC (digital-audio-converters) to its V series for a couple of years now, and had one in module form for the G5. The quad-DAC will now make it to the LG G6 but... it's for the Asian market variants only. This means the rest of the world will miss out on the crisp quality Widely-available Hi-Fi DAC image Similarly, the G6 offers wireless charging, but the feature   US models only. So, the rest of the world will have to plug their cable in to charge the phone — so primitive! Widely-available wireless charging image The G6 comes with 32 GB on-board storage (only Asia / India get 64 GB). Sure, it does have a microSD card slot for expansion, but nothing beats native storage, and lots of it. A bigger storage option image A 5 MP, 100-degree wide-angle selfie camera is barely the best out there in the market right now. With the industry moving to 8 MP resolutions for the front-facing snapper, it feels that LG is lagging behind with the quality a bit here. Hey, if we are to go crazy — we could've even wished for a dual cam module on the front, too, just like the one on the LG V10. All is possible in the game of Nitpick Land. A better front camera image To be completely honest, the users have voted with their money, and it seems that removable battery is not that much of a gamechanging feature. LG took pride in being one of the last major companies to keep its back flap and a user-replaceable battery, but it didn't do it any favors, while Samsung may have been criticized by the power users for deciding to seal its phones with the Galaxy S6, but the sales didn't show customers being dissatisfied. So, it's a polarizing point, sure, but power-hungry, heavy users will miss the option. Removable battery image So, instead of outfitting its newest flagship with the latest and greatest processor by Qualcomm, LG decided to go with the current-gen Snapdragon 821. Its reasoning for this decision is pretty sound — the company wanted to have enough time to properly develop its phone's design and software to get the most out of the processor, and to do that, it needed the proper time with the hardware. Still, gearheads will be disappointed by the lack of cutting edge tech in the brand-new device. Snapdragon 835 image Admittedly, the G5's modules weren't really popular, nor were they readily available or easy to purchase. Still, if you somehow managed to get your hands on an LG Cam Plus or LG Hi-Fi Plus, you won't be able to use them with the G6. In contrast, for example, Motorola's Moto Mods have been promised to work cross-generation for years to come.If you still had some hope for the LG modules and were eagerly waiting for more designs, that dream is now gone.
