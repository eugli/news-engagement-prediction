Emmerdale spoilers: 14 pictures from Robert Sugden and Aaron Dingle’s wedding \nBut have no fear – Danny and Aaron are going nowhere. In fact, it’s quite the oppositte. We are sworn to secrecy for the moment, but future plot details are suggesting that we will be seeing more of Aaron, if anything. \nWhile a prison sentence often means a character going off screen, taking a break or leaving for good, Aaron’s journey behind bars will be followed on screen and we will be able to give you some strong new details on what’s ahead on Sunday 19th February. \nMetro.co.uk recently visited the Emmerdale set for a catch up with Danny, his co-star Ryan Hawley (Robert) and the series producer Iain MacLeod. (Picture: ITV) \nAnd we are safe to assure you that there are big plans ahead for the characters and any current rumours of Danny leaving the role should be dismissed. \nCheck back on our soaps homepage on Sunday 19th February from 7am (we know, early rise on a Sunday!?) for brand new interviews, storyline gossip and maybe even a sneaky new picture or two.
