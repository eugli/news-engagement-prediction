But one thing he’s not known for is apologizing.\nHowever, that all changed when it was announced Monday that the American Conservative Union had revoked Yiannopoulos’ invitation to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference after a January 2016 interview surfaced showing him appearing to defend pedophilia.\n“I am a gay man, and a child abuse victim,” Yiannopoulos wrote on Facebook Monday, responding to news of the CPAC cancellation. “I would like to restate my utter disgust at adults who sexually abuse minors. I am horrified by pedophilia and I have devoted large portions of my career as a journalist to exposing child abusers. I’ve outed three of them, in fact — three more than most of my critics. And I’ve repeatedly expressed disgust at pedophilia in my feature and opinion writing. My professional record is very clear.”\n \nRelated Stories Former ‘Apprentice’ Contestant Files Defamation Suit Against Trump Gloria Allred To Announce Lawsuit Against Trump Woman Who Accused Trump Of Rape When She Was 13 Made The Whole Story Up “I’m partly to blame. My own experiences as a victim led me to believe I could say anything I wanted to on this subject, no matter how outrageous,” he continued. “But I understand that my usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humor might have come across as flippancy, a lack of care for other victims or, worse, ‘advocacy.’ I deeply regret that.”\nYiannopoulos had tried to stem the tide of criticism with an earlier Facebook post.\n\nAdvertisement – story continues below\nAmerican Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp wasn’t satisfied , calling the statement “insufficient.”\n“We realize that Mr. Yiannopoulos has responded on Facebook, but it is insufficient,” Schlapp said in a statement. “It is up to him to answer the tough questions and we urge him to immediately further address these disturbing comments.”\nSchlapp said the ACU “initially extended the invitation knowing that the free speech issue on college campuses is a battlefield where we need brave, conservative standard-bearers. “\n \nTrending Stories Comedian Tweets Donald Trump Jr., Asks Him To Expel Father From White House US, European Officials Probe Soros’ Meddling In Foreign Elections Mexico Foreign Minister Says U.S. Deportations Are Down \" @ACUConservative has decided to rescind the invitation of Milo Yiannopoulos to speak at #CPAC2017 .\" pic.twitter.com/sVWGnPCW7C \n— Matt Schlapp (@mschlapp) February 20, 2017 \n\nMany conservatives expressed disgust with Yiannopoulos’ taped comments and dismay at his CPAC invitation.\nThat includes some of his co-workers, according to a Washingtonian report .\nA senior editor at Breitbart News reportedly said “at least a half-dozen” employees are prepared to walk away from the company if Yiannopoulos is not terminated.\n“The fact of the matter is that there’s been so many things that have been objectionable about Milo over the last couple of years, quite frankly. This is something far more sinister,” the editor was quoted as saying. “If the company isn’t willing to act, there are at least half a dozen people who are willing to walk out over it.”\n“Talking about young boys and somehow seeking to ameliorate concerns over young boys’ relationships with older men … I’m pretty sure everyone in the company would vomit upon hearing these words,” the editor continued. “What right-thinking person doesn’t feel sick to their stomach when hearing something like that?”\nThe report said a second Breitbart worker confirmed the walkout story.\nYiannopoulos’ rise to fame has been partly propelled by the unruliness he causes among liberal students at American universities. He made national headlines after his University of California, Berkeley speech was canceled due to far-left rioters outraged over his presence on campus.\nYiannopoulos’ book Dangerous , which details his exploits and fight against leftism, is set to be released June 13.\nWhat do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:33:19.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
