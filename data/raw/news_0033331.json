It’s been a regular part of their touring setlist since 2015 (technically an outtake from Ibeyi ’s recording sessions), and was featured in the 2016 French comedy Ouvert La Nuit . The track’s sparse production is a master class in negative space, accumulating heft as it progresses. Lisa-Kaindé sings of loneliness on empty city streets; she’s pained with the longing that comes with the distance between lovers, yet warmed by a memory (\"Midnight sunshine, it's your smile, I'm going crazy”). And despite a golden voice that evokes Kate Bush and Nina Simone , the pace and rhythm of her delivery equally borrows from hip-hop and spoken word. Her carefully deployed pauses and intonation nestle within the beats from Naomi’s cajón and batá . The ghostly synth melody echoes over delicate piano keystrokes that give way to more forceful, sustained notes in the second verse, joined by syncopated electronic drum samples in the bridge. Her resigned refrain, “That’s what happens when I’m lost in my mind,” leads into each verse, less a chorus than a reminder that prefaces the tortured dreams that follow. A welcome continuation of the style on their minimalist debut, “Lost in My Mind” is an elegy to the spirits that haunt our minds, bodies, and souls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:35:46.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
