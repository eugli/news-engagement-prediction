Passengers on the flight told multiple media outlets that the pilot got on the PA, and she talked about how she was going through a divorce before saying that President Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are both “assholes.” \n“She started off by saying that she had not voted for either Trump or Clinton because they’re a bunch of liars,” passenger Noel Portugal said to CBS San Francisco . “That’s an odd way to start of the welcome to your flight. It really sort of went downhill from there and didn’t make a lot of sense to any of us.” \nSeveral passengers got off the plane due to their disturbance from the ranting pilot, who was eventually replaced with another captain. The plane departed two hours behind schedule, and United Airlines issued an apology over the incident. \n“We hold our employees to the highest standards and replaced this pilot with a new one to operate the flight, which we expect will depart shortly. We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.” \nYou can watch part of the rant in the video above, as well as a report on the rest of it, via KPIX. \n[Image via Wikimedia]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:46:28.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
