A blank canvas, a place where I could freely express myself. Also, my biological clock was ticking, and I wanted to have a modern, grown-up kitchen and a queen size bed. As soon as I walked into this new gem in Uptown (aka lower Queen Anne to some), I knew it was going to be my next home. It was love at first sight. I loved white walls and glossy concrete floors. And, who would not want to live above a giant grocery store? \nWhen it came to decorating, I wanted my new abode to feel like a vacation home without being overly kitschy. I work long hours and am not home a lot. I provide academic advising to adult learners at Seattle University and also teach Korean. After a long day of work, I desire a place where I can get recharged and feel inspired. I might call myself an extroverted introvert. And, I am a minimalist who loves children's toys and vibrant colors! I wanted to create a space that would suit many strangely conflicting qualities in me. \nLuckily, I had a blank canvas and was thrilled to try everything that was not possible at my old condo. I hung palm tree wallpaper on one wall of my bedroom. I put together my very first gallery wall. And, I played with fun colors! The end result is an uncluttered, modern look teamed with pale pink and blue. I have managed to avoid the generic catalog look and added warmth to white walls. \nIt has been a big year for me. I turned 40 last year. I unlatched myself from the comforts of the familiar and put myself into new experiences. This is not going to be my final place, but I look forward to spending many years here. \nThanks, Suki! \n• Interested in sharing your home with Apartment Therapy?
