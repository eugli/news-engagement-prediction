The other day, a friend who lives near me was in a field, tending her horses. Her dog, a terrier cross, was sniffing in the next field. He came barrelling up to her, tail between his legs, followed by an angry farmer. ‘Your dog was in the field with pregnant sheep! If I have eight aborted lambs, I’m sending you the bill!’ This is a dog who once spent three nights sleeping with an orphaned blind lamb to give her warmth and safety. Liz with Gracie, her rescued collie puppy: She says, 'I recently experienced trouble finding a property to rent, even in a National Park, simply because I have dogs' In the summer, it was so hot I couldn’t leave my dogs in the car, particularly as one, who has since died, was frail. I was desperate for something to eat, so asked at a cafe located inside what was once an old railway station, with concrete floors, plastic chairs, on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales, surely a place where people are likely to have dogs, if I could please bring my dogs inside, as they might die. The place wasn’t exactly Farmacy in Notting Hill; and even Farmacy in Notting Hill is dog friendly. ‘No,’ the waitress said. ‘You can tie them up outside.’ When I finally found a dog-friendly restaurant (The Saddle Room near Leyburn; it’s bloody marvellous), the family at the next-door table with noisy children who obviously haven’t been taught how to sit on chairs or hold forks (though the pasta thrown to the floor led to an impromptu snack), summoned the waiter and asked for me and my two collies to be moved. They were worried about the safety of their children; they should have been more concerned about what I might do. I recently experienced a huge amount of trouble finding a property to rent, even in a National Park, simply because I have dogs. My feeling is that, if you have an aversion to collies, don’t live in the Yorkshire Dales My feeling is that, if you have an aversion to collies, don’t live in the Yorkshire Dales. I did actually say this to the landlord of a frankly awful cottage on a main road with swirly carpet, kitchen tiles depicting sheaves of corn and a boarded-up fireplace. He’d refused to rent to me simply because I have dogs. Why would you live in a village surrounded by mountains but no culture, and certainly no Selfridges, if you don’t have a dog? Even upmarket hotels have insane dog policies. Take one luxury hotel in the middle of the Cotswolds. It’s fine with one dog per booking – as long as the dog is ‘below knee height’. It depends where your knees are, doesn’t it? And how about a policy banning overweight men who wear vests and trainers, or children who scream at the top of their lungs? I’ve been obsessed over the last few days, reading about the murder of children’s author Helen Bailey. I keep looking at the photo of her on a sofa with her miniature dachshund, Boris, loyal to the end. Dogs give the sick a reason to live, and ‘women in the autumn of their years’, as one newspaper put it, women like Helen and me (I’d counter a dog ensures I’m in my prime!), the most loving companions we could possibly wish for. On a walk yesterday on a public footpath by the Swale, renovated with a cost to the taxpayer of many millions, I was met with a sign that said: ‘Due to the danger to waterfowl and ducks, please keep your dog on a lead.’ The world’s gone mad.
