'International excellence' \nCables Wynd House was made famous for its part in Welsh's Trainspotting where it featured as the childhood home of the character, Simon \"Sick Boy\" Williamson. \nProf Miles Glendinning, director of the Scottish Centre for Conservation Studies, said the two blocks combined \"international excellence in modernist urban design with an attention to the spirit of place\". \n\"Edinburgh's post-war multi storey social housing redevelopments were designed to fit into small, highly constrained sites. I believe that Cables Wynd House in particular, was built in its distinctive curved shape as a creative solution to the constraints of that particular site,\" he said. \n\"Along with Linksview House, it represents an outstanding synthesis of international modernist architecture with Geddes's 'conservative surgery' principles.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T13:06:13.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
