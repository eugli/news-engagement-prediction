Dwight Yorke and Katie Price pictured in 2001 (Photo: Clive Mason/ALLSPORT) \nIn her last autobiography, she wrote: \"It’s sad that [Dwight] is unable to accept Harvey for who he is and seems unable or unwilling to work within his limitations. \n\"I think Dwight wanted to blame someone for the fact that his son is disabled. I have always said that if Dwight could see what a courageous and talented boy Harvey is then he would enjoy being with him so much.\" \nIn 2009, he told BBC Radio 5: \"I would like to play an integral part in his upbringing, of course, I love my kid but wasn't given the opportunity to really bring him up in the manner I would like to bring him up in.\" \nDwight has yet to respond to Katie’s latest tweet.

I have lost count of the number of times I have been to America, I love the country, yet I was being made to feel like a criminal. \n\"I had bought my ticket and checked in and was about to get on the flight when I was stopped by two officials. I thought 'what is happening here?’.

I went there to play in a legends match to open a stadium and didn't even stay overnight. \n\"The two officials told me if I got on the flight I would simply be deported back to Qatar once I arrived in the States. I tried to explain I didn't even live in Qatar and was just trying to get to my home in the Caribbean.\" \nDwight’s woes came a month after President Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily banning individuals from Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the USA.
