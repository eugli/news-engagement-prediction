Life in besieged Homs district \nAccording to reports, the suspect was placed under investigation when officials were alerted to his account of events in Syria last year. \nAustria is unable to extradite the man to face charges in Syria because of the ongoing civil war. \nThe decision to try him in the country for his alleged crimes committed elsewhere is thought to be a first in Austria. \nKilling injured soldiers is prohibited under the Geneva Convention. \nOfficials have said the actions that he has allegedly described qualified as terrorism and could be prosecuted under international counter-terrorism agreements.
