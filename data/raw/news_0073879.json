When paramedics presented at the Townsville home he was already dead. \nDetective Sergeant Ben Hunter, who was assigned to the case, said there was never any doubt Mason had been murdered. \nThe injuries had been obtained when Mason was in the sole care of his mothers boyfriend Troy Reed, and they weren’t the first. Mason was murdered by his mum’s boyfriend. Source: News Limited Mason John Parker.

There was another explanation, another answer. It just didn’t come into my head at all.” Troy Reed demonstrated to police his version of how Mason obtained injuries, but was unable to explain how he died.

Things like that,” she said. \nThe wedding never went ahead. \nReed was convicted of Mason’s murder and is five years into a fifteen-year sentence. Mason's grandparents Sue and John Sandeman have pledged to fight for abused children in Mason’s name, and say he’s already saved lives. Picture: Channel 9 Source: Channel 9 \nThere has been one positive to come out of the horrific tragedy, but Ms Sandeman has nothing to do with it. \nSince the 2011 tragedy her parents, Sue and John Sandeman, who have since disowned their daughter, have devoted their lives to making sure what happened to Mason is never repeated. \nTheir fight has led to the introduction of Mason’s Law, which enforces mandatory reporting of injuries by childcare centres. It comes into effect in July. \nThe devastated grandparents say Mason’s safety was the responsibility of his mother — his sole career. \n“That’s the bottom line,” Mrs Sandeman said. \nBut they also said they believe if both childcare centres who had noticed Mason’s injuries had reported them to authorities, their grandson would still be alive. \nMrs Sandeman recalled the last time she saw baby Mason, and the disturbingly prescient last thing she said to him. \n“I said to myself ... am I sending you to your death?” she shared through tears. \nBut instead of living with regret Mrs Sandeman and her husband have pledged to continue fighting, first with the expansion of Mason’s law into Western Australia and Victoria, the two remaining Australian states without mandatory reporting from childcare centres. \n“There’ll always be something we can do to help little kids with their future,” Mr Sandeman said. \nWhile her parents continue their fight in her son’s name, 60 Minutes says Ms Sandeman has put her son’s murder“firmly behind her”, and is focusing on raising the two children she’s since had with her new partner. \n“I’m a good person and honest, and most importantly a good mum,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:43:08.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
