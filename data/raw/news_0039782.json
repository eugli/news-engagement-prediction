Poster for Evan Hara’s “The Boundary.” (J.D. Miles/Twitter) \nMore then 150 people turned out at the Angelika Theater in Plano to watch the screening. \n“I’m having some crazy emotions right now I’m excited I’m nervous I’m hoping the crowd loves it,” says Hara. \nThe movie is about pilots who travel to the edge of the universe. \nThe spaceship seen in the movie was actually built in Evan’s backyard. \n“I realized it was going to be too expensive to fly out to LA to get a professional set,” says Hara. “So with a lot of trips to Home Depot three months later we had a ship in our backyard.” \nThe production took more than a year, a crew of 15, $20,000 and experienced actors who had no idea at the start that the writer, director and producer was so young. \n“I was a little apprehensive or when I had seen his work and it was awesome I could trust him,” says lead actress Crystal Cook. \n“When you look at his work previously it’s like wow this is amazing, and you get there and you got this young man with no facial hair, you’re like what in the world is about to go on,” says lead actorColton Tapp. \nWhile most teenagers are still forming their dreams sitting in theaters and watching movies with bags of popcorn, Evan Hara is behind the screen already living his dream. \n“I hope someday you’ll see me on the red carpet getting an Academy Award, Oscars that’s what my dream is,” says Hara. \nThe film will soon be entered into festivals and if it does well could be on Netflix and Hulu. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.   rewritten, or redistributed.)
