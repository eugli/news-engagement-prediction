The press seems intent on ignoring this momentous development, perhaps because bringing it front and center would expose the Obama administration’s Iran deal as one of the worst fiascos in American diplomatic history.\nI refer to the powerful, durable and growing alliance between Russia and Iran, which, if it continues, has ominous consequences for the United States and its ally Israel.\nFor well over a year, the Russians have been bombing the insurgents fighting the Syrian regime of Bashar Assad. Russia is not just bombing ISIS, as Vladimir Putin has sometimes claimed, but all of the militias that threaten the Iranian-backed Assad regime. That includes those militias that we have armed and trained as a sane, non-Islamist alternative to the regime.\nRussia has its own reasons for supporting Assad, however; by coordinating its air operations with the Syrians and their Iranian backers, Russia is cementing its relationship with the radical, anti-American and anti-Israeli mullahs in Iran.\nWhat last week revealed about the President, Putin and Russia \nThis isn’t the type of regional alliance America can ignore. Rather, it has the potential to escalate conflict in an already volatile region.\nIran, the world’s top terror sponsor, wants to grow more powerful. And in a match made in heaven — or the other place — Russia provides the key.\nThanks to the Obama administration, Iran is becoming the recipient of more than $100 billion in freed-up assets. Meantime, to expand its hegemonic role and to counter both Turkish and American influence, Iran is looking to modernize its military and that of its clients, which include the Syrian regime.\nRussia is looking to sell more of its advanced weapons systems, strengthen its relationship with the potentially lucrative market of Iran — and capitalize on the Syrian conflict to give its troops combat experience.\nRussian military gets massive weapons upgrade \nIt is estimated that Russia has rotated some 10,000 troops in and out of the Syrian conflict, thereby providing a live-ammunition training camp for its troops, securing its relations with Iran and developing a new market for its weapons systems.\nThis is a marriage that President Barack Obama consummated, the first offspring of which will be enhanced Russian weapons in the hands of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthi militia in Yemen.\nWhen pitching its deal, the Obama administration insisted that nothing was as important as delaying Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon.\nThere is strong disagreement as to whether that was accomplished by the agreement. Yet one thing is irrefutable: The Obama administration’s lifting of sanctions and the freeing of sequestered Iranian assets fortified Iran’s conventional-weapons terror threat, both through traditional channels and terrorist militias.\nPriebus says Flynn did nothing wrong in talks with Russia \nIn sum: The Obama administration’s removal of sanctions, coupled with Russian combat support and hardware flowing into Iran, imperils the entire region.\nObama’s legacy is not a non-nuclear Iran, but an economically rejuvenated Iran that has the resources and sponsors to wreak chaos and destruction in the region as it embarks on fulfilling its dream of a Shiite crescent from Iran to the Mediterranean Sea.\nYet because of their dangerous myopia, the American media are unwilling to make this as important an issue as whether Trump really had more electoral votes than George W. Bush or how the Russians “stole” the election for Trump.\nIf we look beyond our blinders, we see profound concern: The Gulf Sunni states are so worried about Iran’s rise that they are allying themselves with their enemy, Israel.\nUkrainian who proposed Russia deal to Trump team investigated \nAs much as they detest the Jewish state, Israel does not project power beyond its adjacent territories, nor has it any desire to do so. The same cannot be said of Iran.\nThe rise of a newly aggressive Iran, one with unprecedented firepower, risks further destabilizing the Middle East. Will America be the last country to pay this significant attention?\nMiller is an emeritus professor of political science, University of Cincinnati, and a distinguished fellow with the Haym Salomon Center. \nTags: featured opinion russia donald trump donald trump first 100 days iran vladimir putin bashar assad syria barack obama Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:30:03.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
