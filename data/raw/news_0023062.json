We have taken this path to democracy, and now I want to congratulate Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo,” the defeated incumbent said .\nFarmajo’s victory was greeted with celebratory gunshots ringing out across the capital city of Mogadishu on Wednesday evening.\nThe election proceeded in a heavily guarded airport hangar in the capital city, where 329 newly elected MPs took part in two rounds of voting to pick the country’s next president from an original list of 22 candidates. A scheduled third round of voting was cancelled when Mohamud conceded defeat after Farmajo took a decisive lead.\nThe vote was held behind the blast walls of the airport due to security concerns, following a series of mortar attacks on the capital city’s airport Tuesday evening. Terrorist group al Shabaab had stated its intentions to disrupt the election, and all main roads in the capital were closed, with African Union peacekeepers patrolling the city.\nFarmajo served as prime minister of Somalia for less than a year in 2010, taking over from the man he defeated in Wednesday’s historic election. Prior to taking office, Farmajo worked as the Commissioner for Equal Employment at the New York State Department of Transportation in Buffalo.\nThe incoming president will face a litany of challenges, including threats of violence from emboldened Islamist terror group al Shabaab, persistent widespread corruption, and a fast-approaching famine .\nNew President of the Federal Republic of #Somalia being sworn in at the moment.

Instead, they gave votes to about 14,000 clan elders, who elected the members of the upper and lower houses of parliament. Farmaajo was the people's choice and, by far, the most popular of the 21 candidates that took part in today's presidential (s)election. pic.twitter.com/o2zxhKzZhj\n— Hamza Mohamed (@Hamza_Africa) February 8, 2017\nSomalia has been torn apart by war and famine over the last quarter of a century, with countries like the U.S. pouring billions of dollars of aid into the country. The U.S. has seen its military presence in Somalia grow recently , though this could change under the Trump administration. Somalia is one of seven countries Donald Trump cited on his contested travel ban, and could face restricted funding. While Western countries are working to rebuild a democracy in Somalia, others have conflicting interests. Various presidential candidates are thought to have been bought off by private interest groups from countries like Turkey, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. Such countries are believed to be using Somalia’s rampant corruption to land lucrative business deals and spy on American activities in the Horn of Africa, according to the New York Times . Despite the U.N. calling the election a “ milestone ” for the country, there has been widespread corruption at the local and national level, including bribery and vote-buying, with up to $20 million changing hands during parliamentary elections. Candidates have also been using fake opponents to make the race look legitimate, the New York Times reports. There have been some brights spots, however. The election is seen as more legitimate than anything that has happened in the last 25 years, and women now represent 30 percent of the elected officials in parliament. If this election proves to be a success, Somalia could get a one-person, one-vote election in 2020.
