He was sworn in on the Capitol steps following a vote by the state legislature making it possible. \nIt’s an achievement Garcia’s not sure could happen today. \n“I don’t know if it would have been possible at all, but I certainly know I would have been subject to being picked up even at school or anywhere because I would have been undocumented at the time,’ Garcia said. \nThe strict new illegal immigration guidelines released by President Trump’s administration read in part: “effective immediately. Department personnel shall faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States against all removable aliens.” \nThe guidelines do leave in place an Obama-era program that granted work permits to those brought to the country illegally as children, known as “dreamers.” \n”I think everybody was kind of thinking they were coming but now actually seeing them it’s made a lot of people panic,” Garcia said.
