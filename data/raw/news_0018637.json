A look at the storage space of the A28 model. Picture: Raden Source: Supplied \nThe bag was launched 10 months ago and has sold more than 20,000 units. \nNow, a waiting list has swelled to more than 10,000 people because production is still catching up with demand, company officials tell The Post . \n“It’s hard to forecast demand,” Raden CEO Josh Udashkin said. About the barrage of orders, he added: “We’re extremely humbled.” \nA huge part of the interest in the suitcase is due to its celebrity fans. British makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury reportedly ordered 40 of the bags for her team, while NBA player Draymond Green purchased one of the bags (in black gloss finish) for each of his Golden State Warriors teammates. \nThe A22, as well as its larger, equally equipped A28 sister model, comes in 10 colours, including gold, bronze, light purple and navy — some with an option of gloss or matte finishes. \nThe most popular option at the moment appears to be the light-pink gloss finish. \nThe Makrolon polycarbonate exterior is crack-resistant, while wheels give 360-degree maneuverability. \nPrices for the A22 begin at $US295 ($A387), while the A28 starts at $US395 ($A518).
