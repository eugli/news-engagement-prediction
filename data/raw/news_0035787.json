We have gone about our work, we had undertaken major challenges during these past few months and valid criticism is something that we are open to and we take it in the spirit in which it is given and try to improve ourselves,” he told CNBC-TV18 in an interview. \nHe said everyone agrees that not just the RBI, but the wider banking system has done a “Herculean job” over the last few months when there were many challenges. \nOn the impact of demonetisation on the economy, Patel said: “Almost everyone agrees that the impact is going to be a sharp ‘V’, that we would have a downgrade of growth for a short period of time.” \nHe added: “However, the remonetisation has happened at a fast pace and that was part of the plan that subsequent to the withdrawal of the specified bank notes our production plans and supply processes would ensure the remonetisation happened as quickly as possible, which given our capacity in terms of printing currency notes is at a high level.” Read more Urjit Patel nudges banks to reduce interest rates on loans \nRBI last week lowered its economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 6.9 per cent from the previously projected 7.1%, but saw it bouncing back in a big way to 7.4% in 2017-18. \nPatel said the benefits of junking 86% of currency in circulation, effected on November 9 last year, will take time to fully play out and needs more work to ensure they are lasting. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:35.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
