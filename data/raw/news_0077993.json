Diep is a contributing writer at Complex Media.\nMore info: Twitter / linkedin / Facebook / Google+ \nFeb 27, 2017 Share Tweet Media via Twitter Is this a repeat of the Golden Globes?\nThe 89th Academy Awards ceremony, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, is taking place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California tonight. While the Oscars haven’t officially aired yet, we’ve already gotten a Hidden Figures and Fences mix-up that’ll most likely fire up the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag again.\nJess Cagle, the Editor-in-Chief of PEOPLE, was on the red carpet commenting on what blockbuster movies came out last year when he slipped up and said “hidden figures.” Smh.\n\nPeople were still recovering from when Michael Keaton and Jenna Bush Hager made the same mistake , and they made sure Cagle heard their frustrations:\nHoly shit. The editor of People just said Hidden Fences. Pack it up folks.\n— roxane gay ( @rgay ) February 27, 2017 Yo somebody just said # HiddenFences on the ABC red carpet. They corrected themselves but still. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/ fl5Tgn5Vd4 \n— Matthew A. Cherry ( @MatthewACherry ) February 27, 2017 you know his internal monologue was like \"don&apos;t say HIDDEN FENCES don&apos;t say HIDDEN FENCES don&apos;t say HIDDEN FENCES\" *says HIDDEN FENCES*\n— alexander smith ( @alexqsmith ) February 27, 2017 10 minutes into the Oscars and a white dude already said \"Hidden Fences.\"\n— PantheR ( @____PantheR ) February 27, 2017 HIDDEN FENCES strikes again #Oscars pic.twitter.com/ uKr4wCXqkk \n— JASON O. ( @jasonosia ) February 27, 2017 We couldn&apos;t make it through the A-block of ABC&apos;s #Oscars coverage before someone said \"Hidden Fences.\" Cool. # OscarsSoWhite \n— Stephanie Levy ( @stephanie_levy ) February 27, 2017 Hidden Fences might win tonight. I don&apos;t know. Bowling Green Ridge is a close contender.\n— gary.graham ( @thegarygraham ) February 27, 2017 Related Why Do White People Keep Confusing 'Hidden Figures' and 'Fences' at the Golden Globes? (UPDATE) Stephen Colbert Actually Made a Trailer for the Nonexistent 'Hidden Fences' 'Suicide Squad' Got an Oscar Nom Over 'Deadpool,' and People Are Pissed We should give him the benefit of the doubt since he immediately corrected himself. But this is live television and Twitter. Better have an apology ready, Cagle.\nWatch Now Tags: News , Videos , Oscars , Fences , Hidden Figures", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:58:42.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
