However, as appealing as a rose-tinted bottle of bubbly may be, it’s not exactly easy to know what you should be looking for, or how exactly you should imbibe said libations. “Some rosés are lighter and best enjoyed as an aperitif before a meal, while others have enough richness to take you all the way through to dessert,” explains renowned wine critic Antonio Galloni, who encourages \"drinking Champagne from a white wine glass rather than a flute, as the larger glass allows for the fullest expression of what is in the bottle.” Below, Galloni shares his guide to the best bottles of rosé Champagnes, at a variety of price points. “Because rosés are typically produced in small numbers, they can often be a little more expensive than regular Champagne,” Galloni says. “But the best bottles of rosé Champagnes, are always worth the money.” We'll drink to that. Gatinois’s NV Brut Rosé Grand Cru , $55This brut rosé is from top-tier vineyards, which gives the wine much of its signature power and intensity. Cranberry, white pepper, chalk and mint are some of the many notes that infuse this striking rosé. Pinot noir plays the leading role in a Champagne that exudes richness as well as class. The Brut Rosé Grand Cru can be enjoyed alone or throughout a meal. R. H. Coutier’s NV Brut Rosé Grand Cru , $61R. H. Coutier’s NV Brut Rosé Grand Cru is bright, focused, and finely cut from start to finish. Cranberry, mint, red cherry, and tobacco are front and center. The resonance of pinot noir and verve of chardonnay blend together in equal parts to create a rosé Champagne that is long on class and personality. Above all else, the Brut Rosé Grand Cru can be enjoyed with just about anything.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:12:07.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
