You're the only person who showed me true love and will always have a place for you in my heart. You were my one true soulmate,\" he wrote. \nMs Ristevski's decomposing body was found in remote bushland in Mount Macedon on Monday. \nHer husband's lawyer on Wednesday revealed Mr Ristevski was a prime suspect in her disappearance. \nRob Stary says his client maintains his innocence. \n\"It's pretty clear police have him as their number one suspect,\" Mr Stary told Fairfax Media. \nMr Ristevski was seen visiting his lawyer's office on Wednesday morning, a day after police confirmed the decomposed remains were those of his wife. \nHe refused to answer questions as he entered the lawyer's building. \nThere was little activity at the Ristevskis' Avondale Heights home on Wednesday afternoon, except for a man walking out the front gate to place a bag of rubbish in the bin. \nA blonde woman delivered groceries to the house in the morning and left shortly after 2pm without speaking to the waiting media. \nTwo bunches of flowers placed outside the house by mourners were collected and taken inside by an unknown man. \nMs Ristevski's brother Steve Williams on Wednesday broke his silence on the disappearance of his sister, saying he hoped the discovery of her body would bring some answers. \n\"I knew Karen wasn't coming home. I knew that from a very early stage,\" he told Nine News. \n\"Hopefully things will now move on more rapidly.\" \nDNA tests were used to identify Ms Ristevski's corpse, and the news was passed on to her family by police on Tuesday afternoon. \nPolice have not revealed if they have any information about possible suspects. \nMs Ristevski's body was found by a passerby along a dirt track off Loch Road, Mount Macedon about midday on Monday. \nPolice conducted a line search at the scene on Tuesday, and have urged anyone with information about suspicious activity in the area to come forward. \n\"Investigators are also hoping to speak to anyone that may have been at Mount Macedon any time from June last year and took photos or any video footage in the area,\" Victoria Police said in a statement. \nMs Ristevski, 47, hadn't been seen since June 29 last year when she apparently left home after an argument with her husband. \nShe hadn't used her bank accounts or phone since her disappearance.
