However, for the 89th Annual Academy Awards on Sunday night, she’s adding a different, lesser-known name to her client roster — Hala Kamil, a Syrian refugee and the star of the Oscar-nominated documentary Watani: My Homeland.

She used to watch the Oscars from her home in Aleppo which has now been destroyed. Tonight she will walk the red carpet.” Director Marcel Mettelsiefen’s documentary Watani: My Homeland tells the story of Kamil and her four children’s journey fleeing from Syria to safety in Germany.
