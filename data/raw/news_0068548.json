David James David James damaged his filling after crunching down on glass in his holiday meal David James 5 David and wife Julie said their holiday that cost almost £5,000 was extremely disappointing \nThe furious traveller told The Sun Online he believed the tour company Thomson had marketed the holiday under false pretences, saying: “Apart from the individual issues that I have had, it’s the fact that a reputable company can say something about a destination that just isn’t true.” \nHe said that the holiday getaway met its first obstacle when their flight was delayed for a day, meaning that they missed out on one of 14 days planned. \nBut on arrival, he said travellers were met with a rusty bus to take them to the five star hotel, where he and wife Julie were given the wrong room. David James 5 The couple said the serenity was ruined by constant construction works \nTold that he could make a complaint after lunch, he said the couple then went to the restaurant on the hotel, which sits on Cape Verde off the coast of west Africa. \nHe said: “We went to the restaurant on the first day and I ate a fork of pasta – crunch. \n“I spat the food out and there was glass. It took my filling out.” \nHe said that he had been offered help to book a dental appointment at the island but wanted to wait until arriving back home in the UK. \nThe management consultant, who works in construction, said the couple had been warned about ongoing construction in the area but had been assured it would not be near their rooms. \nBut instead, Mr James said every time he looked out of his hotel window, he had a view of the construction and heard a constant banging when he tried to go to the spa. \nThe West Midlands local said: “I work in construction – the last thing I want to see or hear is building works.” RELATED STORIES STRANDED IN PARADISE Cape Verde holidaymakers stuck on tropical island over Christmas after dust cloud made it impossible to fly home 'IT RUINED THE HOLIDAY' Paraplegic forced to wash in SINK after Thomson failed to secure wheelchair-friendly room 'WANNA SWIM IN THE SEA?
