Murphy cancels planned discussion at Duquesne University February 21, 2017 3:21 PM J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Upper St. Clair. By Chris Potter / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nIt was supposed to be a chance to “Join Representative Tim Murphy as he discusses his Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act.” But Mr. Murphy. an Upper St. Clair Republican, canceled a workshop scheduled at Duquesne University’s student union at 2:30 p.m. this afternoon. \nThe decision was hastily made: A Duquesne University spokeswoman told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette of the cancellation roughly 45 minutes before the event was set to begin. \n“We were disappointed to learn that Congressman Murphy’s long-planned tour of the Duquesne University Psychology Department and discussion with students on his Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act had to be cancelled today,” said a spokeswoman for Mr. Murphy. “Duquesne staff brought to our attention at the last minute that organizations not affiliated with the university were planning to disrupt the discussion and campus security was unable to guarantee the safety of all involved.” \nRoughly a dozen people were standing outside the student union when the event was set to begin — about half the total number who had showed up to find the event canceled, they said. They were baffled that anyone could see them as a threat. \n“He’s not the man I voted for in the past,” said Randy Sarner of Upper St. Clair. “When he was a young man, I was very excited by him. … I ought to be able to walk in your office and say hello. Now you’re running from me?” \nIt is not clear whether the event, billed as a “workshop,” was intended to be for the general public: On Monday, the university referred questions about the event to Mr. Murphy’s office, which did not respond to a query about the format. But it was featured on flyers and a campus online calendar. Word about the event circulated on social media. \nThose on hand said they were interested in the workshop’s stated topic, but had other questions as well. “I’m a psychologist and I’m very interested in what he’s done for mental health,” said Nick Flower of Mt. Lebanon. “He’s really shined a light on that, but it’s not the only issue I care about.” He and others said they wanted to stress concerns about potential Russian influence on President Donald Trump, among other issues. \nThe cancellation reflects mounting tension over “town hall” events, which have become contentious elsewhere. Republicans have been wary of holding the events for fear that Democrats will disrupt them, taking a page from Tea Party protests common during the Obama administration. Critics say the elected officials are dodging their own constituents. \nMr. Murphy has not held a town hall event, even though Congress is in recess this week. He did hold a telephone town hall in mid-January, but those on hand at Duquesne said that wasn’t the same thing. \n“A town hall is really a chance to talk face-to-face,” said Angela Wateska of Scott Township. She said she and a small contingent of her “412 Resistance” group had planned to attend. \n“I took a day off work to come here and ask questions, and it’s really disappointing that he isn’t here.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:44:32.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
