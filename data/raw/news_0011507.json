I never supported the deal in the first place. I thought it was a huge mistake. But the multilateral sanctions are done,\" Ryan said. \"I don't think you're going to go back and reconstitute the multilateral sanctions that were in place. \"\nHowever, the Wisconsin Republican argued that the U.S. should do what they are able, pointing to the sanctions Trump imposed on Iran Friday, which will target 13 individuals and 12 companies, according to the Treasury Department. He also called for the new administration to \"rigorously enforce\" the nuclear agreement.\nSubscribe today to get intelligence and analysis on defense and national security issues in your Inbox each weekday morning from veteran journalists Jamie McIntyre and Jacqueline Klimas.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

So I think the key is to rigorously enforce this deal.\"\n\"I think what this administration is doing, which I agree with, is saying, 'We have a new administration, and we're going to hold you, Iran, to account,'\" Ryan said. \"This last administration did not do that. This new administration needs to do that.
