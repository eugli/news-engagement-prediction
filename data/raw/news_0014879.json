(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON — The New England Patriots have been the model of consistency in the NFL. But how much longer will the architects be at it? \nHead coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady have worked together for 17 years, an unprecedented run between a coach and player in the NFL or any sport for that matter. \nPatriots owner Robert Kraft said Thursday he wants Belichick to coach the team “as long as he would like to” and with the success the team has had, it’s hard to envision the franchise without its head coach. \n“I’m very happy with him,” Kraft said. “We’ve been together for 17 years. I like it when I hear him say that he’s getting paid to do what he loves. We’ll try to keep him like that.” \nIn the week leading up to New England’s matchup against the Atlanta Falcons Sunday in Super Bowl LI — the seventh such appearance Brady and Belichick are making together — reporters peppered both with questions about the R word: retirement. \n“For as long as the good lord helps me breathe,” Kraft said, “I hope they’re playing or coaching.” \nRELATED: Fifteen years ago, the Patriots were the dynasty no one saw coming \nBrady will turn 40 in August. Belichick is the NFL’s second-oldest head coach at 64, behind Pete Carroll of the Seattle Seahawks. \nBrady said last year he wants “to play for a long time, maybe 10 more years.” If he sticks to his word, Brady would be 48 years old then. By comparison, Hall of Fame quarterback George Blanda set an NFL record as the oldest player to appear in a game in 1975 with the Oakland Raiders, at the age of 48. \nBrady, though, is still one of the top players at his position. He set an NFL record this season for the highest touchdown-to-interception ratio at 28 to 2, completed 67.4 % of his passes for 3,554 yards and posted a QB rating of 112.2 in 12 regular season games. \nHe finished second in the league’s Most Valuable Player award Saturday night. \n“That’s a good question,” Brady said when asked who he thought would retire first. “I don’t know what he plans on doing. He’s the best, and I’ve been very lucky to play for him. He’s so focused on coaching and doing anything he can to help us win. There’s no B.S. with coach Belichick, and I think that’s what players appreciate. When you come into the program, you realize it’s all about football and it’s not a bunch of rah-rah crap that’s not going to matter and has no bearing on preparing you for the game.” CLOSE x Share USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes believes Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time, regardless of the outcome of Super Bowl LI. USA TODAY Sports \nYou could make the argument that Brady is playing as well as he has in his career. Father time, though, is undefeated. \nThere’s a certain point when age strips all quarterbacks of their physical gifts. But Brady’s workout regimen and diet are notorious for maximizing his long-term conditioning and health. This is a man who claims he has never eaten a strawberry and whose food is 80 % organic vegetables and 20 % lean meats. \nBrady’s time will come, but given his production and how the Patriots protect him behind an improving offensive line, it still may be years away. \nMORE: LaDainian Tomlinson headlines 2017 Pro Football Hall of Fame class \nBelichick, for his part, said he hadn’t “really thought about it” when asked this week if he had considered retirement. \nThe son of a long-time coach, Belichick is known for appreciating the grind. And despite his advancing age, Belichick has something that most coaches in the league don’t. He spends time with his family while he’s working. \nHis two sons are Patriots staffers. Steve is the safeties coach and Brian is a scouting assistant. Last week, Belichick called it “special.” He beams when discussing working with Steve and Brian, and it’s clear in listening to him talk about it, their presence mitigates the sting of the sacrifices he has to make — most notably spending so much time away from home. \nThere’s no indication that the allure of coaching is fading. If anything, he seems to relish the challenges. This was the season, after all, in which Brady sat suspended for the first four games for his alleged role in Deflategate. All the Patriots did was rip through those games with a 3-1 record. \n“I don't really see it as work. It actually beats working,” Belichick said. “You get to do what you love to do, dealing with a lot of great people. I have a great staff. Players work hard and are very cooperative and compliant. They have a great attitude about teamwork, playing unselfishly, and working unselfishly. Really doesn't feel like work.” \nPHOTOS: Tom Brady through the years Facebook Posted!
