Source: \nThe telco sent shockwaves across the Australian sporting landscape in late 2015 with a three-year $180-million plus investment to secure the rights to the Premier League. Optus snatch EPL broadcast rights Down Under In an unexpected twist, Singtel-Optus have landed the Australian broadcast rights for the English Premier League in a three-year $50 million deal. \nBut the release of sales figures for the second half of 2016 - when they first broadcast the league - suggests it was a canny decision. \nNews Corp reports Optus added 201,000 new post-paid handset customers between July and December 2016, while fierce rival Telstra added 79,000 in comparison. The result was Optus' best in six years. \nThe telco has the rights to all 380 matches, as well as highlights and other related content, and SBS also broadcasts one match a week. SBS strike EPL deal with Optus SBS and Optus today announced two new deals in which football fans across Australia will be able to watch more than double the number of international football matches, including the English Premier League on free-to-air TV. \nOptus also have the rights to broadcast June's FIFA Confederations Cup and next year's FIFA World Cup, both staged in Russia. SBS have the free-to-air rights for both tournaments. \nOptus executive Ben White told News Corp they were on track to see a positive return on investment. \n\"We have three years to do that but we are very happy with the way it's tracking at the moment,\" White said. \nWhite said they would look to add more content off the back of the Premier League rights, which wouldn't necessarily be sport. \n\"We will certainly in the coming months be talking about some additional exclusive content we will be adding to the service,\" he said.
