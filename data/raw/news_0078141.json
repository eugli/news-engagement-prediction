I think there is little future for Ukip with him staying inside this party. The time for him to go is now”\nUkip former leader Lord Pearson of Rannoch tried to organise a peerage for Mr Farage but lobbied instead for a knighthood when it became apparent he would have had to quit as an MEP. After the bid was rejected he asked Mr Carswell to approach Government chief whip Gavin Williamson to appeal the decision.\nOn December 31, the Ukip MP wrote in an email to the peer: \"As promised, I did speak to the Government chief whip. Perhaps we might try angling to get Nigel an OBE next time round? For services to headline writers? An MBE, maybe? Let's discuss...\"\nMr Carswell said the emails showed “quite clearly I tried my best to make sure he got an honour that reflects his contribution”.\nKey Faces of UKIP 11 show all Key Faces of UKIP 1/11 Nigel Farage\nGetty\n2/11 United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) Migration spokesman Steven Woolfe addresses supporters and media personnel in central London\nGetty\n3/11 Robert Kilroy-Silk, former television presenter and newly elected member of the European Parliament for the UK Independence Party (UKIP), shows a placard against the European Constitution in front of the Houses of Parliament\nGetty\n4/11 Mark Reckless, Director of Policy Development addresses party members during the UK Independence Party annual conference at Doncaster Racecourse\nGetty\n5/11 Gerard Batten MEP poses with protesters outside parliament\nCreative Commons\n6/11 Diane James gives an address at the UKIP Autumn Conference in Bournemouth\nGetty\n7/11 Douglas Carswell MP speaks to party members and supporters during the UK Independence Party annual conference\nGetty\n8/11 Suzanne Evans, Deputy Party Chairman of UK Independence Party (UKIP) speaks during the launch of UKIP's election manifesto\nGetty\n9/11 Peter Whittle, the UK Independence Party Member of the London Assembly, is interviewed in central London\nGetty\n10/11 MEP Mike Hookem during a visit to Concept Metal Products & Co Ltd\nGetty\n11/11 Paul Nuttall, Deputy Leader of the UK Independence Party speaks at a Say NO, Believe in Britain debate at Carn Brea Leisure Centre in Pool near Redruthon\nGetty\n\"If he wants to come and talk to the Ukip Parliamentary Party about it, we are happy to put it on the agenda for Monday's meeting,” he told the Press Association.\n“I'm delighted where I am.
