There have been reports of at least two people removed from the camp with burns. The DAPL pipeline protesters, including Charles Whalen, 50, of Minnesota, have told the AP they plan to offer “passive resistance” if law enforcement, including local sheriff’s office deputies, move in to remove them from the camp.

About 200 to 300 protesters remained at the camp near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. The Army Corps ordered the camp closed and cited fears of potential spring flooding. \nYou can watch live streams from the camp below: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:31:45.910+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
