Kansas shooting raises safety concerns for foreigners in US: 'Do we belong here?' Read more \nWitnesses told investigators that at Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas on Wednesday evening, as patrons watched a Kansas-TCU basketball game, Adam Purinton yelled at two Indian men to “ get out of my country ” before opening fire. \nOne man, 32-year-old Srinivas Kuchibhotla, was killed. Two other men, 32-year-old Alok Madasani and 24-year-old Ian Grillot, were injured. \nMadasani told the New York Times on Friday night Purinton “asked us what visa are we currently on and whether we are staying here illegally”. \nBoth men were educated in the US and were working in the country legally. \nMadasani told the Times: “We didn’t react. People do stupid things all the time. This guy took it to the next level.” \nMadasani said he went in to get a manager and by the time he returned to the patio, the man was being escorted out. \nOn Friday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Kuchibhotla’s death was tragic but added that it would be absurd to link the action to President Trump’s strong rhetoric on immigration, according to Reuters. Man charged with killing Indian said to have shouted 'go back to your country' Read more \nAt a press conference on Friday Kuchibhotla’s wife, Sunayana Dumala, said her husband’s death raised questions about whether immigrants are valued in the US. She wanted an answer to just one question, she said: “Do we belong here?” \nDumala said she had wondered if her family should stay in the US because of its high rates of gun violence but her husband had told her “good things happen in America”. \nMadasani has been released from hospital while Grillot remains hospitalized. Purinton was arrested early on Thursday at a restaurant bar in Clinton, Missouri and jailed on charges of murder and attempted murder. \nThe bar where the shooting occurred is scheduled to reopen even as the community tries to recover from the attack. Austins Bar and Grill will reopen on Saturday. It has been closed since the shooting.
