I still haven't taken it,\" Luis Enrique told a news conference on Saturday ahead of Sunday's La Liga game against Leganes. \n\"Criticism has no effect on me, if it did then I wouldn't have been able to stay in this job for almost three years. We are our own fiercest critics, the ones who most want to improve. Everything else is just a circus.\" \nBarca are on the brink of their earliest exit from the Champions League since 2007 but can get their bid to catch Real Madrid at the top of La Liga back on track when they host struggling Leganes. \nBarca are second in the standings on 48 points and have played two games less than Real but Luis Enrique is still optimistic about their title chances. \n\"It's a different game for us after what happened on Tuesday, a good opportunity to see the teamâ€™s response from a difficult situation,\" he said. \n\"In football everything is exaggerated but I still don't think everything is black or white. We are still alive in three competitions, we're struggling a bit in one of them but we have a small chance. In the other two we're more than alive.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:37:11.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
