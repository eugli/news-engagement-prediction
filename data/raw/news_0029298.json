After that, they go to the banks and realise they are either ineligible for a housing loan, or that the margin was insufficient. \n“Our aim this year is to get at least 15,000 PR1MA units booked, compared to only 4,500 units taken up last year,” he said. \nThe new scheme for PR1MA homebuyers offers “stepped-up” financing for the first five years and a second option to withdraw from the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) Account Two. \nUnder both options, a homebuyer pays only the monthly interest for the first five years; the principal amount is added on from the sixth year until the loan is paid off. \nAbdul Mutalib said applicants must be first-time housebuyers with offer to purchase (OTP) letters from PR1MA, have individual or household monthly incomes between RM2,500 and RM15,000, and not blacklisted under the Central Credit Reference Information System. \nPR1MA has partnered with four banks to provide the special end-financing scheme – Maybank, RHB Bank, CIMB Bank and AmBank. It is supported by EPF and approved by Bank Negara. \nSuccessful PR1MA applicants are advised to contact the partner banks directly for more information. \nPR1MA, which was launched in 2011, has approved about 260,000 PR1MA units nationwide. Out of that, an estimated 132,000 units are being built. \nThese units, which cost between RM100,000 and RM400,000, consist of apartments or terrace houses. \nThe Government had also recently raised the household income eligibility of applicants from RM10,000 to RM15,000. \nAbdul Mutalib explained that PR1MA had received cases where households above the previous RM10,000 limit still could not afford to buy homes at market prices. \n“This will not affect those earning below RM10,000 because in our database, 64% of applicants have a monthly household income of between RM2,500 and RM4,000,” he said. \nOn the Government’s move to halve the moratorium period for the resale of PR1MA homes, Abdul Mutalib said PR1MA and its partner banks agreed that five years was a reasonable period. \n“Most PR1MA houses are usually bought by first-time house owners. We reckon they would want to keep their homes rather than cash out after five years. \n“Also, some of them would be at the start of their career when they buy a house. As they progress, their needs will change so they can upgrade to a more suitable property after five years and not 10,” he said. \nPR1MA has also proposed that the Government begin the moratorium period from the date of the Certificate of Completion and Compliance (CCC), instead of the Sales and Purchase Agreement signing date. \nRelated story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:44:54.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
