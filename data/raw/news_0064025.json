Beyond communicating to US taxpayers how the government is representing their interests overseas, that daily briefing and public outreach by the department serves to put the global community -- both friends and enemies -- on notice about American priorities and interests. Read More Since Secretary of State Rex Tillerson took the helm February 2, there has been little in the way of communication about Foggy Bottom's priorities, schedules or policies. Current and former State Department staffers and observers have said that might be a function of Tillerson getting settled into a new and enormously challenging job. They also point to the possibility that the White House may be seeking to take the lead on foreign policy. And they flag a nuts-and-bolts problem: Many leadership positions at State remain unfilled, leaving staff without direction. As a former ExxonMobil CEO, Tillerson himself comes from a corporate culture that isn't particularly open to the press. And a careful silence might seem safer for now, one former State Department official suggested, given that the administration's foreign policy has included many mixed messages, with President Donald Trump publicly establishing positions that other Cabinet members have publicly rejected. While Trump has questioned NATO and floated the idea of a one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Vice President Mike Pence and other top officials have reaffirmed the US commitment to NATO, while US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has said the US remains committed to a two-state solution. The State Department on Wednesday said that regular press briefings conducted by a spokesperson will resume but did not provide details on when that might happen. It added that \"the department is also exploring the possibility of opening the briefing to reporters outside of Washington, DC via remote video capabilities.\" That practice has recently begun at the White House and some media watchers have described it as a way for the spokesman to avoid answering questions from regular White House press that the administration has criticized.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:36:50.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
