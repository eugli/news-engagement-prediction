All we can do is be there for the ones that are playing and pushing them and letting the manager know you are there if needed.” \nDespite defeat, Wolves manager Paul Lambert was far from dejected saying: “I'm not one for being happy at defeat but my players were outstanding.

We went toe to toe with one of the best sides in football and I've got nothing but praise for the team, I'm very proud of them.” \nJose Mourinho claimed it's dangerous and disrespectful to play weak teams in the FA Cup – and Conte clearly agrees. \nThe Chelsea boss made seven changes, but all his big guns Costa, Hazard, Pedro, Willian and Fabregas were on show and the only gamble was flanking Terry with talented youngsters Kurt Zouma and Nathan Ake in a three man back-line ahead of Asmir Begovic. \nHardly a Klopp-style reserve side - and just as well too with Lambert's confident stars in the mood to add another upset to a day of Cup shocks.

Costa was more ruthless moments later after Matt Doherty cruelly ran the ball into his path. poll loading Will Chelsea win the Double this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:39:26.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
