(JONATHAN ERNST/REUTERS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   8:51 PM \nWASHINGTON — President Trump will use his first address to Congress to promise the \"renewal of the American spirit\" — and try to reset some Americans' vision of his own presidency after a disruptive and chaotic first 40 days in the White House. \nThe speech comes after a short, dark inauguration address that focused on \"American carnage\" and a tumultuous month-plus where Trump has moved rapidly to disrupt broad swaths of government — leaving mixed results, irate opponents and some nervous Republicans. A plurality of Americans disapprove of the job Trump has done, according to most recent polls, a historically weak position for a new President. \nThe speech could prove a pivotal moment for Trump as he begins to turn away from the executive order-heavy style of governing by fiat that he embraced in his first month and begins to grapple with the hard work of passing major legislation. \nThe Trump administration began those efforts on Monday by floating an initial budget blueprint that would slash $54 billion in domestic government spending — a cut of more than 10%- and shift that money into military spending. Those proposed shifts would have huge impacts on how the government operates. Trump has also promised swift action to reorder government spending priorities, build a border wall with Mexico, repeal Obamacare and redo the tax code — much of which can't be done by the White House alone. \nTrump wants cuts to domestic agencies to boost military spending \nPolitico reported he plans on cutting the EPA budget by 24% — from just over $8 billion to $6 billion. State, which has $50 billion a year budget, could be hit with a 30% cut, Reuters reported. Foreign aid would also be reduced. \n\"This budget expects the rest of the world to step up in some of the programs this country has been so generous in funding in the past,\" a White House official who asked not to be identified said. \nWhite House officials promised \"an optimistic look forward,\" promising it would focus on \"economic opportunity in the United Sates and protecting American citizens.\" \nThey'd planned to share excerpts of the speech with reporters Monday evening, but after starting a background briefing a half hour behind schedule they said Trump was still working on it. \nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer suggested earlier on Monday that the speech would focus more on a broad message rather than policy specifics. \n\"I would not anticipate the speech being a defense of legislation and executive orders,\" he said. \nThe speech comes as Trump looks to regain his footing, calm nervous Republicans and fire back against a furious opposition that's been mounted by Democrats. \nCongressional Republicans were strongly critical of the chaotic rollout of Trump's ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority nations — and have been increasingly defensive about potential ties between Trump and Russia, even as most have stood by him in recent days. Some Republicans have also expressed increasing concerns about Trump's focus on the \"fake media\" and habit of unpredictable attacks against his critics — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently said he hopes Trump's speech will be \"tweet free\" and has repeatedly criticized his Twitter broadsides. \nRosie O’Donnell will lead an anti-Trump rally outside White House \nAnd Republicans are warring internally over how to repeal and replace Obamacare, a top agenda item for both Trump and congressional leaders. On Monday, some top House conservatives announced they'd vote against the plan congressional GOP leaders have been pushing. \nThe moment comes at a bleak time for Democrats, just months after losing the White House and being locked out of power not only in Washington but the vast majority of statehouses across the country. \nTheir choice for a rebuttal speech symbolizes their recent electoral decimation. Former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear (D), who expanded Medicaid and defended Obamacare in a deep-red state, will deliver their official response speech, but Beshear's Republican successor is in the process of dismantling his expansion, and Democrats hold just one-third of the governorships around the country. \nDemocrats have seen a huge resurgence in liberal activism since Trump's win, with the Indivisible movement, women's march and rowdy town halls in districts across the country showing that in opposition they have the wind back in their sails as they defend Obamacare and demand investigations into possible links between Trump campaign officials and Russia. \nTrump says Hollywood's focus on politics caused Oscar flub \nMany have chosen guests to the speech that symbolize the reenergized movement and their biggest complaints about Trump's new policies. Rep. Nydia Velazquez's (D-N.Y.) is bringing Hameed Darweesh, a refugee and Iraqi translator for the U.S. Army who was initially kept from passing through customs at Kennedy Airport by Trump's travel ban. A number of congressmen are bringing children of immigrants whose parents have recently been deported or who are \"DREAMers,\" immigrants brought here as children who are protected by an Obama-era program \nDemocrats spent Monday downplaying the speech's importance, slamming the President for promising populism and delivering plutocracy. \n\"Tomorrow, 40 days after he took office… President Trump will not have lifted a finger to help middle class families,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a joint press conference with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). \n\"If past is prologue, the President will use populist rhetoric in his speech, but he won't back it up with real actions,\" Schumer said. \"His speech tomorrow will mean nothing if this President continues to do as he's done these first few weeks: Breaking promises to working people and putting an even greater burden on their backs, while making it even easier to be wealthy and well-connected in America.\" Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:18:54.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
