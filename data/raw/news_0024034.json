Her sister Rochele is understood to have moved to the UK to join her in March last year. \n'Beautiful smile': Karla Roman was killed in a crash in Whitechapel \nMiss Roman’s cousin Sabrina, speaking from the family’s hometown of Bento Gonçalves in south-eastern Brazil, told the Standard: “We have no words. We are so sad that we won’t see her beautiful smile again. \n“We want her to be near us, we want her home.” \nShe added: “We are concerned about Rochele and want her back here too – they were so close. We know that she had made many friends in London.” \nA family friend added: “Karla is from a very small town in Brazil and her family are very private and grieving a lot.” The scene of the horror crash in Whitechapel (HackneyCyclist/Twitter) \nMiss Roman studied for a degree in architecture in Brazil for five years before moving to Turin in 2009 to complete her Masters. \nShe moved to London to pursue her career, waitressing part-time as she became qualified to work in the UK and applied for jobs. \nShe began work at award-winning LOM Architecture and Design, based in Shoreditch, in January 2015. Karla Roman, who died as she cycled to work in east London \nShe was an architectural assistant at the firm, listed among the UK’s top 100 practices, whose most recent projects include a new sports centre in Watford opened by the late former England football manager Graham Taylor and boxer Anthony Joshua. \nSylwia Manlai, who had worked with Miss Roman at Carluccio’s in Garrick Street, said former colleagues were “shocked and speechless”. \nThe 31-year-old said: “She was a very smiley, positive and energetic person. She never complained. She was a very beautiful, intelligent woman. \n“It is a huge loss to all of us and none of us can believe that what has happened is for real. \n“She was very educated and qualified as an architect, so she went to do the job she loved.” Flowers left at the scene of the crash in Whitechapel \nSamantha Celentano, 33, added: “She was full of life. She was smart, beautiful, clever – she knew so many languages. I love her so much, and I miss her so much. I will remember her forever.” \nFlowers and cards have been laid near the scene of the crash in Whitechapel High Street. \nOne read: “Dearest Karla, your smiles, energy and kindness will be missed always.” Another said: “Karla, I love you.” Karla Roman, who was killed in a crash as she cycled to work \nThe driver of the coach stopped at the scene of the crash and has not been arrested, police said. \nMiss Roman was fatally injured less than eight hours after newly-wed Anita Szucs, 30, was killed in a suspected hit and run near her home in Enfield at 1.45am on Monday. \nTwo men, aged 19 and 22, have been questioned by police of suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of a collision. Both have been bailed until next month pending further enquiries. \nActivists from campaign group Stop Killing Cyclists will gather for a “die-in” protest in memory of both women outside the Treasury on Horseguards Parade at 1pm on Saturday. \nThe vigil will coincide with a protest demanding increased investment in the UK’s cycling and pedestrian infrastructure to 10 per cent of the transport budget. \nStop Killing Cyclists spokesman Caspar Hughes said: “It is crucial that our national cycling infrastructure gets its fair share of national investment.” \nA friend who set up a crowdfunding campaign raising money to repatriate Miss Roman’s body said: “Karla was taken from us too early, and like many people aged 32 had no insurance, she just had plans, ambition, love and kindness.” \nIt smashed its £10,000 target in less than 12 hours.
