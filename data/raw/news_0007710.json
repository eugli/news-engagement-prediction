Self-discipline, unfashionably, is vital. Keep anguished and angry phone calls until after bedtime; children hate overhearing them. Don't burden them with details about legal fights or sexual infidelity. Avoid arguing in front of them and above all do not demonise the other side, however badly you think your ex-spouse has behaved. Children have a right to two parents. Poisoning their mind against one of them is “stealing” part of a child's “natural physical, emotional and spiritual inheritance”, she argues. Some contact with even the most awful, addicted or inadequate parent is usually better than none at all: it helps the children make sense of what has happened. Very few parents, Ms Evans notes, have absolutely nothing to add to the lives of their children. \nThe other big lesson is that broken homes can be patched up from the outside. Grandparents, neighbours and others can offer children windows of happiness in an otherwise bleak week, with security, fun, companionship or a phone number (usually treasured but rarely used, in the author's experience) to call if things become unbearable. Such helping hands should be non-judgmental. The last thing a stricken ex-spouse needs to hear is that they are drinking too much or cooking too little.
