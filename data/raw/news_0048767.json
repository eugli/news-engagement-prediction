Geldenhuys had confessed to police that they had planned the robbery, Davids told the court. \nWhen he heard this, Hendricks looked at Geldenhuys and told the court he knew nothing about the murder. \nNetwerk24 reliably learnt on Monday that Verwey had been stabbed 50 times in the face, neck, and chest. Geldenhuys had apparently said in her statement that they were not supposed to have killed Verwey. Jewellery and a cellphone were reportedly stolen and sold. \nThe case was postponed to February 27 for a formal bail application. cape town crime \n  .
