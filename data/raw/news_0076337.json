SHARE Struggling: Venezuela's Adrian Solano gets used to the snow for the first time in his life. Photo: Matthias Schrader \nVideo shows Solano immediately losing his balance when coming out of the gate, slipping over repeatedly and tripping over his skis. Yet, he is proud of his performance. \n\"I fell and did not give up. Not everyone gets up but I got up more than 30 times,\" he said in an interview two days after his return to Venezuela. \n\"Many people don't realise that practicing on asphalt is very different to practicing on snow because the snow has a different texture.\" \nDown he goes: Solano fell over many times during his run. Photo: Matthias Schrader Advertisement \nBack with his family in the sweltering city of Maracay where he learned to ski on wheels, Solano said he had long dreamed of competing abroad and that his friends and neighbours had helped him save for a flight to Europe ahead of the competition, giving him time to perfect his technique on snow rather than asphalt. \nThat flight alone was near impossible in a crisis-stricken country where many, including Solano, earn the equivalent of just a few dollars a month given an economic meltdown which has left many hungry and standing in long supermarket lines. \nWhen Solano turned up with just 28 euros ($A39) in cash at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport late last month, however, immigration officials did not buy that he was a world-class skier. \nHe was forced to return to Venezuela five days later, he said. His story caught the attention of Finnish TV personality Aleksi Valavuori who set up a crowdfunding campaign and raised more than 4,000 euros ($A5,500) to pay for another flight via Madrid. \n\"Something had to be done,\" said Valavuori, speaking from the Finnish city of Turku. \"I knew absolutely nothing. I'd never heard of Venezuelan skiing.\" \"HOLY SH*T, HE CAN'T SKI\" \nValavuori tracked down Solano, dejected and back in Maracay, and told him he had a second shot at the championships. \n\"Aleksi was like a guardian angel,\" said Solano. \"This was my dream.\" \nValavuori and an interpreter drove to Helsinki airport to collect Solano, who marvelled at seeing snow for the first time. \nLess than 12 hours after arriving, Solano was first out of the gate for the cross-country event. \n\"It was my first experience on skis on snow in my life,\" he said. \"I was scared.\" \nWatching from the sidelines, Valavuori began to realise something was not quite right. \n\"At first, I was like, 'Holy sh*t, he can't ski,'\" said Valavuori, \"but the longer it went on, the more he became a hero.\" \nThe video went viral with both endearment and harsh criticism on social media. \nSome Venezuelans are fuming that he embarrassed them internationally and suspect he was promoted by the ruling Socialist Party. \nThey point to Instagram photos of Solano with a locally-famous leftist who dresses like late Argentine guerrilla Che Guevara in military garb and posing with members of the Party's youth movement. They also note he has no photos of himself skiing. \nSolano says the photos are old and that he made it to the championships with zero help from authorities. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:48:05.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
