It even prompted the Four Barrel-backed coffee shop to spring for a beer and wine license so nighttime patrons could have something to wash it all down with. Until now, however, Baker and his team of occasional pizzaiolos have only been churning out their pies one or two nights a week. That’ll change this weekend when the Mill kicks off six nights a week of pizza service. That leaves Tuesdays as the only pizza-less days at the Mill and diners can still expect the pie options to rotate nightly. Recent pies have included a dino and curly kale pie with sunchokes and white miso, Nacho Pizza and this burrata beauty . If pizza still doesn’t do it for you, the Mill is also serving up vegetarian sandwiches on their house-baked bread Thursdays through Sundays from 11 a.m. until they sell out.
