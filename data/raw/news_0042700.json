The series also will star Tony Danza (as Carson’s longtime executive producer Freddie de Cordova), Jane Levy and Ian Nelson.\n“At a time where the value of women seems to be in question again, I am loving my role as a woman who handles her business in a man’s world,” Keymah said in a statement on her hiring.\n“Like everyone else, I was a huge fan of Johnny Carson. Though I never got a chance to be on his show, I now feel connected to him. That’s pretty cool. Also pretty cool is the fact that television has evolved to the point that we can spotlight a game-changing show through this exciting new technology.”\nSome of Keymáh’s recent credits have included Syfy’s cult favorite franchise “Sharknado 4: The 4th Awakens,” and the offbeat indie comedy “What Happened Last Night?”\nAt this point, Seeso has yet to announce the official air date for the launch of “There’s … Johnny.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:48:14.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
