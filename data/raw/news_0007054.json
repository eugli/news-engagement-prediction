He’ll earn the team’s submitted salary of $2MM, instead of the $2.7MM that he sought. \nThat $2MM figure is also the exact projection of the MLBTR model developed by contributor Matt Swartz. Abad earned $1.25MM last year and is due to qualify for free agency after the 2017 season. \nAcquired in a summer trade from the Twins, the 31-year-old Abad fell shy of expectations upon arriving in Boston. He had compiled a 2.65 ERA over 34 innings in Minnesota, but surrendered nine earned runs over his 12 2/3 frames with the Red Sox while struggling to limit the free passes (12:8 K/BB). \nStill, Boston obviously saw enough value to tender a contract and keep Abad around as a second lefty to complement Robbie Ross Jr. Abad held same-handed hitters to a meager .153/.195/.264 batting line last year, and figures to be utilized as something of a lefty specialist in 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:30:20.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
