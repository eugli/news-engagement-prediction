The new car’s nose continues a similar sort of philosophy but in a slightly more aesthetically pleasing way. \nA reconfigured livery sees silver rather than black now the car’s predominant colour, the colours making the protrusions look almost like fangs either side of the central extension.

Cast your eye further up the nose towards the cockpit. \nThe VJM10 has brought back the stepped nose. It’s hard to miss the step in the VJM10’s nose. Source: Supplied \nThe ‘stepped nose’ arrived on the F1 grid in 2012 after safety concerns prompted a rewrite of the technical rules. \nChassis cockpits were being designed higher and higher to direct air under the floor of the car to generate downforce, causing the tip of cars’ noses to rise to the point that \nSo, for 2012, the FIA mandated that the nose cone could only be a certain height — except that was different to the maximum height of the chassis monocoque. \nThat led to many teams adopting the stepped nose in order to both satisfy the rules and enjoy the benefits of underfloor airflow. \nThe FIA tried to quell fans ire by allowing teams to fit a vanity panel over the step in 2013, before the step was properly eradicated amid the hybrid-power rule changes of 2014. \nWhile neither Sauber nor Renault have designed a stepped nose into their cars, it remains to be seen if any other 2017 contenders will interpret the new rules in the same way as Force India.

Source: Supplied \nPerez claimed podium finishes in Monaco and Azerbaijan in 2016, believing there are plenty of reasons to be very hopeful Force India can take the next step this year. \n“I trust totally this team,” said Perez. “I expect a very big year for the team.” \n“In none of the teams that I’ve been with in Formula 1 I’ve seen this level of confidence, organisation, everyone doing their jobs. We have plenty of reasons to be hoping for a great year. I think Force India will give a big surprise this year, I have a feeling we have done a tremendous job over the winter.” The Force India VJM10 Mercedes. Source: Supplied \nIn keeping with the other teams to have launched their 2017 car so far, Force India’s technical chief Andrew Green said the VJM10 contained few carry-over parts from last year’s car. \nPerez said simulation date pointed to lap-time gains of up to six seconds. \n“It’s a big step from last year to this year,” the Mexican added. “We expect four to six seconds how much quicker the car goes. \n“The amount of downforce we are going to be generating this year, I think I’ll have to go back and keep training my neck!” The Force India VJM10 Mercedes.

We’ve got a big aerodynamic change in regulations coming for 2017 and you never know, it’s possible that somebody does mess up in those circumstances. \n“But in the long run, the top teams invariably end up in the top positions. If they could keep banging in fourth and fifth places in the Constructors’ Championship, because that brings it’s own reward and helps towards the team’s stability as well, they’d be doing really well.” \n- with Sky Sports", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:17:42.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
