Read the story \nAlthough the emergency spill was small, it started to erode the hillside Sunday afternoon. \n“There was significant concern that [the erosion] would compromise the integrity of the spillway, resulting in a substantial release of water,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said at a Sunday evening news briefing. \n“We had to make a very critical and difficult decision to initiate the evacuation of the Oroville area,” he added. \n“Immediate evacuation from the low levels of Oroville and areas downstream is ordered,” proclaimed a Sheriff’s Department statement posted on social media. “This is NOT A Drill.” \nThe order affected rural communities located along the Feather River and included the counties of Butte, Yuba and Sutter. Oroville residents were told to make their way north of the lake to Chico, where an impromptu evacuation shelter had been set up at the fairgrounds. \nThe Yuba County Office of Emergency Services urged evacuees to travel only to the east, south or west. “DO NOT TRAVEL NORTH TOWARD OROVILLE,” the department said on Twitter. \nAs traffic slowed to a crawl, travelers reported encountering road blocks heading north on California highways 70 and 99. For those headed south, the driving was no easier as thousands poured onto the highways in an attempt to evacuate. \nBelen Castaneda, 23, a preschool teacher from Biggs, fled her home around 4:30 p.m. for the Silver Dollar fairgrounds. \n“We just grabbed everything we could,” she said. “Everyone was freaking out.” \nCastaneda and her family — three sisters and her mom and dad — drove in two separate cars, bringing along their elderly neighbor who doesn’t speak English. \nCastaneda said her family took special care to bring irreplaceable items. “Old family pictures we had brought from Mexico that we had for a long time,” Castaneda said, “and our birth certificates.” \nShe also grabbed a couple items from her sprawling makeup collection. \n“Some of that stuff is limited edition,” she explained. \nBy Sunday night, experts were planning to plug the crevice in the emergency spillway with bags of rocks dropped from helicopters. \nThey had also doubled discharges down the main spillway to help lower the lake level and reduce the overflow. \nLake Oroville is the keystone of the State Water Project that sends Northern California water hundreds of miles south to the southern San Joaquin Valley and the Southland. \nIn addition to flooding concerns, if operators can’t easily get water out of the lake that could interfere with deliveries to contractors, including the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. \nA series of powerful storms in Northern California sent runoff rushing into the lake just as a gaping hole developed in the main spillway Tuesday, forcing managers to reduce releases. \nThat pushed the reservoir to overflow Saturday, marking the first time the emergency spillway was used since the dam was finished in 1968. Until Sunday afternoon, it seemed to be going smoothly. Water flows from Oroville Dam’s heavily damaged spillway \nMillions of gallons of rushing water continued to pound and erode the massive Lake Oroville Dam spillway. \nMillions of gallons of rushing water continued to pound and erode the massive Lake Oroville Dam spillway.

A retired chef and Korean War vet, he wasn’t sure where to go. \nHe couldn’t get to Chico on his bike. He had a small bag with shaving gear, a washcloth and paper towels. “No blankets. No water,” he said. \nHe remembered the 1997 evacuation order, which he ignored. There was no flooding then and he was pretty sure nothing would happen this time. \n“I don’t believe it’s going to happen,” he said. \nBut he wasn’t comfortable enough to go back home, so he kept watching the water in the river below. \nOn Sunday evening, Christopher Cruz, 21, and his girlfriend, Jessica Isaacson, 18, waited outside of a CVS surrounded by the plastic jugs they had filled with water and the snacks and clothes they’d packed. \nStranded in Oroville, where they rent a room, they had hoped Isaacson’s mother would pick them up, but she was stuck in Chico. Finally, they called local law enforcement, who told them to wait outside the pharmacy until someone came for them. \nCruz said that when Lake Oroville started to hit its overflow point a few years earlier, he had thought about packing a bag. \n“I just thought everything was going to blow over,” he said. \nThis time, with no car, he and Isaacson had set out walking, only to run into a police officer who told them in no uncertain terms that they were going in a dangerous direction. \n“Heading that way is heading for death,” he told them.
