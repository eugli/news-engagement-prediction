By: PTI | Mumbai | Updated: February 19, 2017 10:17 am “So happy to share Newton has won the Art Cinema award for the Forum section at Berlinale. Congratulations team.” \nRaj Kummar Rao and Anjali Patil starrer political satire Newton, which had its world premiere at the 67th , has won the International Federation of Art Cinemas (CICAE) award in its Forum segment. Rao shared the news on Twitter by congratulating the entire team of the Amit Masurkar-directed movie. \n“So happy to share ‘Newton’ has won the Art Cinema award for the Forum section at Berlinale. Congratulations team.” The movie, which also stars Pankaj Tripathi, revolves around the story of a rookie clerk on election duty in a conflict-ridden jungle of Central India, who tries his best to conduct free and fair voting. \nThe director, who rose to fame after helming 2014 film Sulemani Keeda, earlier told PTI he believes that only Rao could have done justice to the character. “I thought of Raj Kummar because the character was somebody, for which I needed a person, who could pull off a huge range. Plus I needed an actor of his age. The amount of the energy he could send to the role I couldn’t think of anybody else. So happy to share #Newton has won the Art Cinema award for the Forum section at #Berlinale . Congratulations team @ManMundra @Amit_Masurkar \n— Raj Kummar Rao (@RajkummarRao) February 18, 2017 \n“Raj is the extremely dedicated guy. He is with you one hundred percent. And, I would love to work with him in more films.” Amit had also confirmed that the movie will release in mid-2017. Some 43 films were screened in the Forum segment at the festival, which concludes on Sunday. \nAlso Read: Kabir Khan to collaborate with Amitabh Bachchan after Salman Khan starrer Tubelight? \nActress Huma Qureshi’s Hollywood debut “The Viceroy’s House” also had its world premiere at the 2017 Berlinale.
