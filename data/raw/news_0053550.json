The boa constrictor, which is not venomous but can still kill with its powerful crushing force, is 200 centimetres long. \nThe practice of owning exotic animals is controversial, but largely legal thanks to a patchwork of laws across the country. \nOntario is widely considered to have the least stringent laws around exotic animal ownership. The provincial government has banned only two animals for domestic ownership – killer whales and pitbulls. It is up to municipal governments to create their own bylaws restricting the types of animals that can live within its jurisdiction. \nSome municipalities, like Toronto and Ottawa, maintain lists of prohibited animals that need to be updated constantly. Niagara Police say there is no such list in place for Thorold, where the break-in took place. \nNor are there licensing requirements for businesses that focus on exotic animals as a main commodity. \nZoocheck Inc., an industry watchdog with a focus on animal welfare, has documented a significant spike in the number of businesses offering animals for sale or entertainment in the past five years. \nExecutive Director Rob Laidlaw said such businesses are easy to establish and can operate freely thanks to the lack of enforcement tools. \nREAD MORE: Venomous snake captured in Ontario conservation area \n“Today, all you need is a bunch of animals in your basement or your garage or your backyard, and a computer,” Laidlaw said of the requirements to get established in the industry. “We could set up an animal business probably in about two hours. Have a nice website, a bunch of photos, and start sending some emails.” \nGavin said the investigation into the Thorold theft is still in the early stages, adding police do not yet know how many suspects they’re looking for. \nHe said the first priority is to rescue the snakes, both to eliminate a risk to the public and for the sake of the animals themselves. \n“If someone chose that they no longer wished to possess the snakes, these aren’t something that you just pull up somewhere, dump them off and say, ‘here’s the snakes,”‘ he said. \n“Certainly we wouldn’t condone by any means them being released into the wild. Obviously because those animals aren’t natural to this habitat and they’re deadly, but also, with the cold temperatures, it would likely kill them.” \nThe reptiles would likely be returned to the original owner once recovered, he said. \nAnyone with information is encouraged to come forward. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:16:34.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
