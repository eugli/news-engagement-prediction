Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins was not one of those players. And while there's still plenty of time for Washington to tag 2016's seventh-highest-rated passer before Wednesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline, the delay until the 11th hour lends some credence to the idea that the team might not be convinced Cousins is the man to lead it for years to come. That perception has existed for some time, mainly because the Redskins reportedly low-balled Cousins in long-term negotiations last offseason, per Mike Garafolo of NFL Network, and because he remains without a tender let alone a contract right now. And then you've got the well-connected Daniel Jeremiah from NFL Media, who suggested on 1090 AM San Diego last week that there's greater than a 50 percent chance Cousins isn't a Redskin in 2017. Jeremiah was connecting dots in D.C. and California, where the San Francisco 49ers have an opening at quarterback, plenty of money to spend and a new head coach who used to oversee the Redskins offense. Chris Wesseling @ChrisWesseling More @MoveTheSticks: Greater than 50% Cousins not w/ Skins next year. Wouldnâ€™t be shocked to see Cousins-to-SF trade https://t.co/aqBigUszte 2/22/2017, 1:56:45 AM Might Cousins wind up reuniting with Kyle Shanahan in the Bay Area? Might he land elsewhere? The Broncos , Bears , Texans , Jaguars , Jets , Bills and Browns could all be seeking something new under center. If any are willing to pay Cousins more than the Redskins are, you might see Washington make a deal. Of course, in order to be traded, Cousins would have to belong to the Redskins. That means they'd have to hit him with the $23.94 million tag by Wednesday afternoon before flipping him at the start of the new league year. If they don't want to pay Cousins that kind of money, and they don't feel confident that they'll be able to trade him or sign him to a long-term deal of their liking, the only option is to let him hit the open market on March 9. But this would become a whole lot easier if general manager Scot McCloughan would just wake up and realize that his organization would be best served biting the bullet and paying the man. Promise him his $24 million this week and hope to work out a long-term agreement that will save the team money in the short term. Worst case, you get another year with a Pro Bowl quarterback in his prime, giving you a distinct opportunity to make a run in a league that possesses 32 teams and fewer than 32 franchise-caliber quarterbacks. If he crashes and burns in his third season as a starter, you move on knowing you took a swing at a hittable pitch. And if he succeeds, you have enough evidence that he's the real deal to fork over big long-term bucks in 2018. Best case, you strike a long-term deal this summer and have several years with a quarterback who has been one of the best in the game since becoming a starter in 2015. If he crashes and burns, you hope it was a one-year anomaly and hold on for another season or two. If he succeeds, you look smart. In none of those \"keep Cousins\" scenarios would the Redskins be forced to wonder what could have been. The only way that happens is if they let him walk or trade him and his career continues to take off elsewhere. You don't know what you've got 'til it's gone. The Redskins have to consider what teams like San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Houston, Jacksonville and Cleveland have been going through. They have to avoid \"grass is greener syndrome\" like the plague. They don't have a suitable replacement for Cousins and nobody in the draft or on the market has the same credentials. Let's remember that we're talking about a 28-year-old quarterback who during his first two full seasons as a starter has been the sixth-highest-rated qualified passer in the NFL, behind only Tom Brady, Matt Ryan , Drew Brees , Russell Wilson and Dak Prescott. In that span, only three quarterbacks (Brees, Ryan and Philip Rivers) have passed for more yards, yet 12 have thrown more interceptions. And his 7.9 yards-per-attempt average ranks fifth, behind only Ryan, Wilson, Prescott and Ben Roethlisberger .
