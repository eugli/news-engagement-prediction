More on that process here ). \nThe Huffington Post is keeping a running tally of where each Senate Democrat stands, in support of or opposition to Gorsuch, below: \nOPPOSED : \nSen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon \n“If President Trump were serious about healing the divisions in America and undoing the damage wrought by Senate Republicans last year, he could have named Merrick Garland to fill this seat,” Merkley said, referring to President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee which the GOP blocked last year. \n“This is a stolen seat being filled by an illegitimate and extreme nominee, and I will do everything in my power to stand up against this assault on the Court.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:58:49.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
