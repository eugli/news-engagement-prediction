Whether or not students would be tasked with other janitorial duties was not reported.\nTRAVIS COUNTY LIVING: The best school district in Texas is also ridiculously wealthy\nHigh school students may also have to pay additional fees to participate in athletics. According to the Dallas Morning News the pay-to-play scenario could see students paying up to $200 to play high school sports.\nAnother plan has volunteers acting as library aides instead of paying for paid staffers.\nLast year Frisco ISD lost $30 million in state funding after the end of a fund called Additional State Aid for Tax Reduction. A proposed property tax hike in the area was struck down by voters.\nHouston Chronicle sports writers Angel Verdejo and Adam Coleman discuss the Texas High School Football 2016 season highlights and low points.\nMedia: MediaOS Video These ideas and others came from a set of recommendations from community members and school district officials in a recent brainstorming sessions and focus groups.\nPASS AND FAIL: Texas issues letter grades to Houston-area schools, districts\nIt appears, according to the Star-Telegram report, that everyone agrees that extracurricular activities aren't in danger, but that pay-to-play might make more sense for the district. Additional student fees could also be added for club activities and travel, two expensive pieces of the equation.\nThe openings of at least four new schools has been delayed to cut additional costs.\nFrisco ISD is one of the fastest-growing districts in the state of Texas.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/22/52/8202932/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/33/51/8501829/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/22/52/8202930/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/10/57/7375817/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/10/57/7375817/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/45/12/12210825/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/51/61/33/10950399/3/920x920.jpg", "https://k12.niche.com/rankings/public-school-districts/best-overall/s/texas/", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/05/54/45/1493341/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/45/31/61/9804919/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/22/52/8202930/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/53/35/66/11394434/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/11/74/63/2608326/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/01/42/75/405325/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/50/17/60/10550288/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/54/64/75/11751250/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/54/21/46/11606451/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/70/12/7832239/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/45/01/12210273/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/13/13/8434386/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/frisco/2017/02/13/frisco-isd-soon-use-students-janitors-just-one-cost-cutting-idea-consideration", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/21/62/00/4661279/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/01/42/75/405325/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/45/31/61/9804919/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/54/21/46/11606451/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/53/07/73/11304648/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/05/34/12080905/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/42/66/61/9137268/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/10/10/31/2131527/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/24/77/41/5503051/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/22/52/8202932/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/10/34/12093213/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/53/07/73/11304648/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/12/44/72/2772661/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/33/51/8501829/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/51/61/33/10950399/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/42/66/53/9136895/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/30/8803885/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/11/74/63/2608326/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/05/34/12080905/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/51/00/46/10750340/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/51/00/46/10750340/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/04/33/24/1160475/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/10/10/31/2131527/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/42/65/05/9130308/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/12/44/72/2772661/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/04/33/24/1160475/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/05/54/45/1493341/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/10/34/12093213/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/42/66/53/9136895/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/30/8803885/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/45/12/12210825/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/70/12/7832239/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/45/01/12210273/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/42/65/05/9130308/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/53/35/66/11394434/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/32/35/01/6934617/3/920x920.jpg", "https://k12.niche.com/rankings/public-school-districts/best-overall/methodology/", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/21/62/00/4661279/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/42/66/61/9137268/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/24/77/41/5503051/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/32/35/01/6934617/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/54/64/75/11751250/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/50/17/60/10550288/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/13/13/8434386/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-14T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:13:10.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
