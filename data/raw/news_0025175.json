On Wednesday, Trump found time, 20 minutes after his daily intelligence briefing, to tweet out an attack against the department store Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s fashion line. \nThe next day, Trump’s aide, Kellyanne Conway, encouraged people to buy Ivanka Trump branded items. This is a clear violation of federal ethics rules, which ban any federal employee from endorsing a product or the “personal activities” of another person. Advertisement \nIt was a reminder of something that seems to have been brushed aside: Trump continues to be closely tied to — and is profiting directly from — his business interest s. While Trump has resigned from his various companies and created a trust, the latter exists solely for his benefit and is not a blind trust. It’s also revocable at any time. \nAll this means that Trump can make decisions as president, criticize or curry favor with foreign governments, even tweet attacks on businesses, that will directly aid him monetarily. \nOn Thursday it was revealed that a lobbying firm working for the government of Saudi Arabia booked rooms at Trump’s DC hotel . This is in direct violation of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which prohibits any US official from accepting gifts or payments from a foreign entity. Only three weeks into his presidency, and we have clear evidence that Trump is in violation of the Constitution, which could constitute an impeachable offense. \nRepublicans complained constantly (and misleadingly) that Hillary Clinton was running a pay-for-play operation with the Clinton Foundation while secretary of state. Now Trump is doing exactly that as president. He is acting brazenly and without regard for the appearance of a direct conflict of interest, and the Republican Congress is silent. \nUtah congressman Jason Chaffetz, who is charge of the congressional committee tasked with oversight of the executive branch, has made clear that he has no intention of looking into Trump’s business dealings. Even by the low standards of congressional Republicans, the cowardice being shown by Chaffetz in not confronting the president is astounding. \nWe now have strong evidence of high-level members of the president’s staff, and perhaps the president himself, engaging in unethical and potentially illegal actions. It’s easy to get distracted by Trump’s tweets or by the avalanche of leaks about his bizarre behavior, but Trump’s Russia connection and his abundant business conflicts cannot be ignored. Until they are addressed, they will remain — to harken back to a phrase used to describe White House behavior of another era — a cancer on the Trump presidency. Michael A.
