Those are the people he should be dealing with.\"\nO'Leary's Facebook post had racked up about 3,900 likes in 24 hours.\nO'Leary is an entrepreneur and a star of the U.S.-based \"Shark Tank\" reality show who spends much of the year in Boston.\nHis Conservative leadership campaign has been likened to U.S. President Donald Trump's for a no-holds-barred speaking style that often dominates media coverage of the race.\n\"I reach millions of Canadians each week through the media, and I have promised all of them that I will shine the light on mediocrity and incompetence in government when I see it,\" O'Leary said in the letter.\n\"So, I am putting you on notice. It's time you start doing a better job for the people in Nova Scotia. If you don't? Well you can ask your friend Kathleen Wynne what happened to her poll numbers when I started writing letters.\"\nO'Leary called the Ontario premier \"incompetent\" after she criticized his comments on Ontario's auto sector. He slammed Wynne over Ontario's more than $300-billion debt and suggested she call a snap election.\nHe had also targeted Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, a New Democrat, before he formally joined the race.\n\nRelated Stories Kevin O'Leary finds a new premier to target: Nova Scotia's Stephen McNeil Photos Kevin O'Leary makes a point at the Conservative leadership candidates' debate, in Halifax on Saturday, Feb. 4, 2017.
