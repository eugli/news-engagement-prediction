Jay Bilas, left, and Brent Musburger (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 2:52 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 2:52 a.m. ET \nBrent Musburger got an extra five minutes behind the microphone for ESPN on Tuesday. No doubt he appreciated every additional second. \nThe finality of the night, Musburger's last network telecast, was evident in the legendary broadcaster's voice during the closing minutes of Kentucky's 90-81 overtime victory over Georgia in Lexington. There was almost a somber vibe at times as Musburger and analyst Jay Bilas described the action late in the second half.Â \nMORE: Most memorable calls of Musburger's career \nAfter the final horn, Musburger got an on-air handshake and a thank you from Kentucky coach John Calipari. Then it was Bilas' turn to thank Musburger for his service to the sports TV industry, and to introduce a short video montage of Musburger's most memorable calls. The video highlighted Musburger's versatility: football (pro and college, of course), basketball (same), baseball and even NASCAR and horse racing. \nThe video ended with a younger Musburger saying, \"I'll see you down the road.\" Musburger used that quote to segue into his farewell address. \n( UPDATE: Musburger later joined Calipari on the coach's postgame show, and more tributes were given.) \nMusburger, 77, moves on to a gambling-centric venture in Las Vegas (and yes, he mentioned the point spread at least once during the game; he told everyone Georgia was a 16-point underdog). \nMORE: Brent talks 'bad beats' with SVP \nHe announced in late January that this game would be his last. It was an oddly timed statement considering it came in the middle of the college basketball season;Â people speculated that maybe ESPN was pushing out Musburger for his comments about Oklahoma running back Joe Mixon during the Sugar Bowl. Musburger later said leaving was his idea. Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T14:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:40:16.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
