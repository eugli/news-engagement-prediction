New Cars' Soy-Coated Wires Give Rodents Plenty To Chew On Forbes 1 day ago Michael J. Dunne, Contributor\n© Provided by Forbes Media LLC 20170210_143416 JoAnn Kozakowski-Koch loves her 2016 Volvo XC60.\nTrouble is, so do the rats in her neighborhood. They’re chewing through wires in her engine compartment, causing hundreds of dollars in damages.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo JoAnn and her husband Tracy live in Santee, Calif., just east of San Diego. Recently retired, they enjoy the open road, exploring new places. The first clue that something was wrong came last October. “I had just taken the car in for the 10,000-mile check at the Escondido dealership,” JoAnn said, “when I got an alert about the tires.”\nAt first, they thought the tire pressure alert might have something to do with their recent road trip to the Grand Canyon. The tires were just fine, it turns out. ”The guys at the dealership had a look and told me that rodents had done some wire damage.” JoAnn paid $400 for repairs and figured she’d left her Volvo in an unlucky place at the Grand Canyon National Park.\nBut JoAnn’s duel with rats was just starting. Several days later she got an alert that her water coolant was low. Hmmm, strange. She checked under the hood and, to her dismay, she saw freshly chewed wires. JoAnn read on the internet that peppermint worked as a rodent repellent so she spread some on the driveway.\nOne afternoon, she decided to check on the wiring. Any fresh damage? Easing the hood up, she laid eyes on a portly rat crouched on top of the engine block. She slammed the hood and ran back into the house yelling for her husband.\nTracy came out, looked inside and assured JoAnn that the rat was gone. But he also saw that the wires looked more chewed up. This time, they took the XC 60 to a different Volvo dealership in San Diego. The service guys confirmed what JoAnn already knew: Rodents had chewed through wiring. That set her back another $200.\nSince the second visit, JoAnn and Tracy have upped their game. Tracy set out some traps and has caught one rat.\nMeantime, JoAnn conducted an exhaustive Google search and discovered a new rat repellent: Coyote urine. She bought a supply of the Coyote formula from Home Depot for $24 — plus shipping.\n© Provided by Forbes Media LLC 20170210_144105 Every evening, Ms. Kozakowski-Koch places a sponge soaked in coyote urine on a tin vessel near her front tires.

She also places a Coyote urine-soaked sponge inside a tin pan near the car. She’s not sure it’s working yet and does not want to take her car in for any more repairs until she’s rid of the rats once and for all.\nMeantime, the couple noticed something else strange: Their other car in the driveway, an older Toyota MR2, seemed to be immune from the rat attacks. Why was her Volvo getting all the attention?\nShe called the Volvo service hot line. After some back and forth with the customer service representative, JoAnn unearthed a missing piece of the puzzle: Some Volvo components are apparently coated with materials derived from soy. Aha!\nSome newer model cars use materials like soy that are more biodegradable than plastics. It’s all part of an effort to make car parts more environmentally-friendly. A Volvo service representative at a Volvo dealer in Michigan confirmed some instances of chewed wires, though they “mostly occurred in rural areas — not cities.” A Volvo spokesperson said that an “initial investigation [into the subject] did not return any substantive info.”\nBut JoAnn’s experience with her Volvo does not appear to be an isolated case. Honda, Toyota and other automakers seem to be experiencing chewed up wires, too.\nFriends of mine experienced a setback with their recently purchased 2014 Mazda 5. One weekend, they parked at a campground in San Diego a few miles from the ocean. During the Sunday return drive, the car got stuck in second gear and would run no faster than 30 miles per hour. They had to get off the highway and take side streets home.\nService advisors at their dealership confirmed that chewed wires had caused the automatic transmission to lock into second gear. The entire wiring harness had to be replaced. Their newly-obtained Mazda had a 30-day warranty so the dealership agreed, “with great reluctance”, to cover the $1,200 in repairs.\nSome Toyota and Honda owners say they have shelled out thousands of dollars to replace wiring. In September, 2016, a class-action suit was filed against Toyota for vehicles produced between 2012 and 2016 that used soy-coated wiring. Honda was also slapped with a class-action suit earlier in 2016 for vehicles produced between 2012 and 2015 . The common denominator appears to be soy.\nAlas, no green deed goes unpunished.\nAre the rat turf wars enough to spoil JoAnn’s feeling for her Volvo? No – at least not yet. “My husband and I do lots of road trips. I love the way the 4 wheel-drive works. It feels like the tires are bolted right to the road.”\nNow if only Volvo could find a way to bolt the rats at a safe distance from the soy, JoAnn’s life would be perfect.\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook and Twitter\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Class-Action-Lawsuit-Alleges-Rodents-Chewing-Eating-Car-Wiring-393480601.html", "http://forbes.com/", "https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/322450-class-action-lawsuit-rodents-chew-hondas-soy-coated-wires/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MSNAutos", "http://www.facebook.com/MSNAutos"], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:54:17.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
