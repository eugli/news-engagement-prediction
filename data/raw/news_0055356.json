And often the responses are laced with humour and panache. It has 1.7 million followers on Twitter. \nEarlier this week, De tweeted a photo of a fat policeman with the caption, ‘heavy police bandobast in Mumbai today’, referring to security arrangements for the city’s civic elections. We love puns too Ms De but this one is totally imisplaced. Uniform/official not ours. We expect better from responsible citizens like you. https://t.co/OcKOoHO5bX — Mumbai Police (@MumbaiPolice) February 21, 2017 \nThe Mumbai Police tweeted back that they got the pun but that the policeman was not one of theirs, finishing the tweet with a jibe that they expected better from a responsible citizen like her. \nIts Twitter account is operated by a group of police officers and an online agency, Hat media, which helps them with content and creative campaigns. The team’s main brain comprises Deven Bharti, joint commissioner of law and order, assistant police inspector Ashwini Koli of the Web Development Cell and Hat media’s Sunchika Pandey. \nRead| Seven times Shobhaa De proved she is the queen of controversy on Twitter \n“At any given time, there are six others who monitor the tweets Mumbai Police are tagged (to). A traffic police officer is also stationed as many complaints are traffic related,” said Pandey. \nWhen asked about De’s post and the reaction of Twitter, Pandey said, “Senior officers felt that somebody of De’s stature should have been responsible. \n“Before the tweet, the Mumbai policemen were working for 40 hours relentlessly to ensure that the election proceedings are carried smoothly.” \nThe social media’s ‘virtual control room’ is at the Mumbai Police headquarters in South Mumbai where officers armed with laptops and desktops trawl the internet for information and surveillance. Pandey and the team get together regularly to decide on campaigns, graphics and design. These are then sent to police commissioner Datta Padsalgikar for approval. \nThe other part of the social media cell is to react to tweets that tag Mumbai Police. \n“It is like a two way communication process for us. We get to know a lot of information from people and we too can reach out to them. Our CCTV cameras and policemen cannot reach everywhere and hence this medium provides us with lot of inputs,” said Bharti said. \n“Everyone is not well verse with the complaint proceedings and our team helps them out.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:27:29.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
