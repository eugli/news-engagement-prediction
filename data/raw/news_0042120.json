Advertisement \nThe woman posted her photo on FlyScoot Facebook, showing a direct comparison between the food that was served and the food as advertised in the menu. The real item appeared to be less appetizing than the menu had shown it to be. \nIn response to her complaint, FlyScoot Facebook admins decided they would try to be \"funny\" or \"witty\" in reply. They wrote: \"Hi Candy, we're sorry that our food in person looks nothing like it did in picture. You know what they say.... #Selfies always look better. P.S. McDonald's burger doesn't fly 40,000ft in air. Cheers.\" \nUnfortunately, this response drew the ire of netizens, who did not take issue with the poor presentation of the inflight food, but were appalled to read such an unprofessional reply from the FlyScoot customer service team. \nOne netizen wrote: \"Trueky Shocking reply from Scoot....puzzled this kind of reply is acceptable to some of you guys ? Budget airlines does not equate budget customer service.\" \nThe netizen who had written the original complaint also responded: \"Are you trying to crack a joke but apparently it not funny. Is this your way of replying to your customer? What a 'Budget' way of answering...\" Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
