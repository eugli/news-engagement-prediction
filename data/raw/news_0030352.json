But, if you ever Google him, read up about him, listen to his music and talk to him, you will learn that you are probably sitting with a veteran. Sure, he’s young and has a long way to go; so do most of us. But, Sartek has already come a long way, been through a lot and is ready to take on the world because he believes in what he’s passionate about—music. © Facebook \nAnd that’s probably the only reason why today, he’s on the road to achieving all that he wants and more. How else would you explain becoming the first Producer DJ from India to be on Russia's biggest label Showland Records (a sub label of Armin Van Buuren’s reputed Armada records) with ‘I'm Trippin’? How else would you explain earning international repute for his track ‘Don’t Need Love’ which was released on Hardwell’s label last year? He’s got some of the top DJs of the world featuring his tracks on their popular radio shows—from Hardwell, to David Guetta, Armin Van Buuren to Chuckie and Sander Van Doorn, among many others. © Sunburn \nAnd what’s more? The artist who happens to be the only Indian to grace the prestigious Beatport top 100 (Electro House) multiple times with his tracks ‘Back To The Future’ (#51), ‘Dopamine’ (#73) and last release ‘Don’t Need Love’ with continued global support from industry stalwarts, is all set to release what could possibly be one of the biggest releases of his career on Sony Music international, called called Jump Right After You, in collaboration with Ale Q. \nWe wish our Indian prodigy all the luck and prosperity with this track! \nPhoto: © EDC India (Main Image)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:22:04.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
