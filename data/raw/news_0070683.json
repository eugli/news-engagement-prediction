As a result, the other supposedly pan-Indian parties like the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have suffered a serious decline -- with the NCP being the worst sufferer. \n\nNext to Modi, the credit for the BJP's good showing will go to the mild-mannered Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis, who proved to be a contrast to the Shiv Sena chief, Uddhav Thackeray, who still tries occasionally to display his father, Bal Thackeray's hallmark belligerence. \n\nAfter the electoral setback, however, when the Shiv Sena has barely been able to keep its nose ahead in the poll outcome, winning 84 seats to the BJP's 82, Uddhav will have to decide whether to remain as a part of the saffron alliance in Maharashtra and at the Centre. \n\nYet, he cannot be unaware that he can no longer afford to throw his weight around since his hopes about emerging as an influential regional player have been dashed. \n\nHis only consolation will be the virtual decimation of his estranged cousin, Raj Thackeray's MNS. It is not unlikely that Uddhav will now be ruing his summary rejection of Raj's offer of a tie-up before the polls. \n\nUddhav may have read the tea leaves right in the matter of the Shiv Sena's primacy over the MNS. But he will be aware of the clouds over the Shiv Sena's future. \n\nAs the BJP gloats over its first major post-demonetisation success, its other source of joy will be the discomfiture of the Congress, which has become \"a crowd around a fading dynasty\", as Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said. \n\nThe assembly election results may still breathe life into the dynasty, especially in Punjab. But, for the present, there is little doubt that the somewhat tattered Grand Old Party is in serious trouble. \n\nWhat this means is that the BJP no longer faces a major challenge at the national level. It may come up against major obstacles at local levels, such as in Mumbai or in West Bengal, Bihar and Kerala. \n\nThese regional parties may chip away at the BJP's overall vote share. But its tenure at the Centre is unlikely to be disturbed any time soon. \n\nAt the same time, it is clear that the BJP remains as heavily dependent on Modi as before. It was fortunate to have someone like Devendra Fadnavis to keep the flock together in Maharashtra. The party also has successful Chief Ministers in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Haryana. But none of them can match Modi's popularity at the national level. \n\nThis paucity of leaders is bound to be highlighted, especially in Uttar Pradesh, when the election results are out. But, for the present, the BJP has reason to smile. \n\n(Amulya Ganguli is a political analyst. The views expressed are personal.
