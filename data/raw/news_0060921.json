But here, I am still fighting to get justice. I have wasted my 25 years,” Narayanan said immediately after the hearing in his case ended. The court fixed February 23 to hear his petition. \nNarayanan’s career was ruined after the 1994 Isro spying scandal made headlines. He was given a clean chit after a CBI probe held that the Kerala police had fabricated the case. \nThe scientist was arrested after the Kerala police nabbed Mariam Rasheeda — a Maldivian woman — on October 20, 1994. Though she was arrested for overstaying in India, police later accused her of being involved in a sex-spy scandal. \nIt was alleged that Rasheeda was the intermediary between the organisation and two more women. She was accused of passing on Isro’s cryogenic programme secrets to the women, who in turn supplied the same to Russia and Pakistan’s ISI. \nTwo years later, the CBI cleared all the accused, who were discharged in May 1996. CBI also filed a closure report before the court. But a change in the government re-opened the probe. The earlier consent given by the state to the CBI to investigate the case was withdrawn and the Kerala police was asked to hold a fresh inquiry. \nIn 1998, the Supreme Court quashed the state government’s decision. On Narayanan’s petition, the Kerala high court, in September 2012, ordered the state government to pay Rs 10 lakh as interim relief to the scientist. Later, in October 2014, action was ordered against the errant police officials. \nHowever, a division bench reversed the order in March 2015, which Narayanan has challenged before the Supreme Court. His grievance is that despite the CBI probe indicting the police officers, the state has not taken any action against them. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:12:51.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
