But that doesn't mean they don't have a say in who gets to the White House . \nThat's because voters in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands , Guam and American Samoa are permitted to participate in the presidential primary and are granted delegates by the two major political parties. \nIn other words, Puerto Rico and the other U.S. territories get to help nominate the presidential candidates. But voters there cannot actually participate in the election because of the Electoral College system. Puerto Rico and the Electoral College \nWhy can't voters in Puerto Rico and the other U.S. territories help election the president of the United States? Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution makes it clear that only states can participate in the electoral process. \n\"Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress,\" the U.S. Constitution reads. \ncontinue reading below our video What Is the Electoral College? \nThe Office of the Federal Register, which oversees the Electoral College, states: \"The Electoral College system does not provide for residents of U.S. Territories, such as Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and American Samoa to vote for President.\" \nThe only way citizens of the U.S. territories can participate in the presidential elections is if they have official residency in the United States and vote by absentee ballot or travel to their state to vote. Puerto Rico and the Primary \nEven though voters in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories can't vote in the November election, the Democratic and Republican parties allow them to select delegates to represent them at the nominating conventions. \nThe national Democratic Party's charter, enacted in 1974, states that Puerto Rico \"shall be treated as a state containing the appropriate number of Congressional Districts.\" The Republican Party also allows voters in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories to participate in the nomination process. \nIn the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, Puerto Rico had 55 delegates - more than Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, D.C., West Virginia, Wyoming and several other states with populations lesser than the U.S. territory's 4 million. \nFour Democratic delegates went to Guam, 3 went to the Virgin Islands and American Samoa each. \nIn the Republican presidential primary of 2008, Puerto Rico had 20 delegates, and Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands each had 6. What are the US Territories? \nA territory is any area of land that is administered by the United States government but not officially claimed by any of the 50 states or any other world nation. Most depend on the United States for defense and economic support. \nPuerto Rico, for example, is a commonwealth - a self-governed, unincorporated territory of the United States. Its residents are subject to U.S. laws and pay income taxes to the U.S. government. \nThe United States currently has 16 territories, of which only five are permanently inhabited: Puerto Rico, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. Classified as unincorporated territories, they are organized, self-governing territories with governors and territorial legislatures elected by the people. Each of the five permanently inhabited territories may also elect a non-voting “delegate” or “resident commissioner” to the U.S. House of Representatives. \nThe territorial resident commissioners or delegates function in the same way as members of Congress from the 50 states except not being allowed to vote on final disposition of legislation on the House floor. They are allowed to serve on congressional committees and receive the same annual salary as other rank-and-file members of Congress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:17:42.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
