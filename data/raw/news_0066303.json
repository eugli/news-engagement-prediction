Without spectrum, the sector will suffocate.” \nNhleko specifically solicited more spectrum allocation and a release of the one that belonged to Visafone, which equity shares MTN acquired in 2015. \nIn his response, Prof. Danbatta said: “I like to state that our word is our covenant. When we take decisions, we are concerned about the stability of the industry and there is no way we can guarantee it without considering the dominant status of MTN and its obligations. \n“If the dominant status is becoming stringent, we are open to engagement, we will be guided by what is happening in the market to ensure the growth and development of the sector. \n“The sector has contributed very well to the National Gross Domestic Product, GDP, and has shown remarkable resilience in this recession.” \nDanbatta said the NCC made a case for relaxing fiscal policies towards the sector to the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, adding that the CBN governor was favorably disposed to request and further engagement, especially towards major players who desired to import equipment to aid deployment of broadband infrastructure services and others. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:06:38.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
