Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, when he was asked about Trump’s attacks on Twitter and in speeches. Trump has called a federal judge who blocked his travel ban from seven Muslim-majority countries a “so-called judge.” He has also urged his followers to blame the judge and the judiciary, should there be any terrorist attack carried out by an immigrant. A Gorsuch spokesman confirmed the comments were made in the Wednesday afternoon meeting, when he was asked about the “so-called judge” line. \nVocal Trump cheerleader Laura Ingraham, for one, isn’t thrilled by Gorsuch’s comments: Indep Jurist or Runaway Judge? \"Gorsuch says Trump's tweets abt judiciary are 'demoralizing' and 'disheartening'\" https://t.co/Fylw3rMtuW \n— Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) February 8, 2017 Is this a terrible sign that Gorsuch desires to fit in with the elites—or a sign that he really is that clever? https://t.co/2GXOPvBeGo \n— Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) February 8, 2017 Judge Gorsuch's comments abt @realdonaldTrump 's tweets are concerning. Judges Pryor or Hardiman know better. Doesn't bode well \n— Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) February 8, 2017 @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump any federal judge would have said the same thing as Gorsuch. \n— Michael Abromowitz (@FootballExpert) February 8, 2017 Wrong. Most would refrain from commenting on the guy who just nominated him, regardless of merits. But perhaps the @nytimes will be happy https://t.co/xZbMgrMwNa \n— Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) February 8, 2017 Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:40:40.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
