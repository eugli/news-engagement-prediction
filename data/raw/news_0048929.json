The project is based on the South Korean movie “Killer Toon.” \nPenchant developed “The Scrawl” and will executive produce along with South Korea’s CJ Entertainment, which released “Killer Toon.” \nPenchant is also developing a feature thriller titled “The Mean Tide,” directed by Shana Betz. The film will center on an exonerated ex-convict hose prison ties threaten to destroy his second chance at life. Liska Ostojic, Justin Partridge and Mark DeGaetani all have writing credits on the project. \nEggers will oversee Penchant’s development slate. Her credits include Lasse Hallstrom’s “The Hoax” and “Winter Passing” while working at Ozla Pictures and Stratus Film Company. Hudson’s credits include “Highjacked” and “Bloodwork.” Porter worked for Valhalla Entertainment, Ozla Pictures and Morgan Creek. \n“Recognizing the increasing need for quality, reasonably priced content across a variety of new and existing platforms, we started Penchant to create sophisticated, commercial entertainment for audiences worldwide,” the three founders said. “We are thrilled to be working with so many talented collaborators who share our passion and commitment to quality storytelling, from script to screen.” Filed Under:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:40:17.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
