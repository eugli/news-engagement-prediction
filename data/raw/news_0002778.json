That sounds like a possibly bad thing, and one of the achievements of “This Is Everything: Gigi Gorgeous” is its very entertaining demonstration that it’s not — at least not necessarily. Ms. Lazzarato, better known as the transgender YouTube star and model Gigi Gorgeous, was designated male at birth, in 1992. In camcorder footage from the ’90s, her father, David, invokes “America’s Funniest Home Videos” as the infant then named Gregory Allan Lazzarato does something winsomely amusing. Parental documentation, including a period when Greg was a teenage diving champion, turns to self-documentation on YouTube, with a series of videos on makeup application, each lesson capped with the directive to “Stay gorgeous.” Video Trailer: ‘This Is Everything: Gigi Gorgeous‘ A preview of the film.

Watch in Times Video » embed “This Is Everything,” directed by the Oscar-winning documentarian Barbara Kopple , is produced and presented by YouTube Red, the for-pay arm of that video service, and it’s to the company’s credit that the abuse Ms. Lazzarato suffered in her channel’s comments section back in the day isn’t soft-pedaled. While Ms. Kopple is best known for the strong voice and sharp eye she brings to projects about social injustice (her Academy Award-winning “Harlan County USA” and “American Dream” chronicled labor conflicts in the heartland), in this movie the political takes a relatively distant back seat to the personal. Most of the footage in the first two-thirds is archival, with clips shot by Ms. Lazzarato as she chronicles surgical procedures during her transition from male to female. Her brothers and mother are spectacularly supportive. (“I think gender’s a false construct,” one brother, Adam, tells the camera.) Her father is more hesitant and circumspect, and there’s conflict. Ms. Lazzarato sometimes seems to goad her father, and is reflective and a little regretful after he finally gets it. Adam Wescott and Scott Fisher, Ms. Lazzarato’s management team, are executive producers for the film, and to a great extent “This Is Everything” seems to follow an agenda set by them in tandem with the movie’s subject, which is largely commendable in its pitch for acceptance and against bigotry. Still, I wish there were more behind-the-scenes material showing those managers trying to oversee the Gigi Gorgeous brand. Discussing a New York Fashion Week jaunt, one of them says it would be “more credible” than seeing her attend a “RuPaul’s Drag Race” season premiere, and then envisions Ms. Lazzarato in a Target ad. But the goal here is not to analyze postmodern celebrity culture. “I’m a real person, too,” Ms. Lazzarato says near the end. “I’m literally just like you.” That’s the brief.
