Sessions then, and now\" https://t.co/4Wu99c2vZm \n— CNN (@CNN) February 8, 2017 \nOne of the moments from today’s White House press briefing getting a lot of attention was Sean Spicer talking about Coretta Scott King . \nThe uproar in the Senate last night stemmed from Elizabeth Warren reading a letter Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ‘s widow sent legislators in the 80s opposing the nomination of now-Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions to a judgeship. \nWarren reading the King letter earned her a reprimand for violating a Senate rule on impugning the character of fellow senators. Spicer took a shot at Warren and Democrats at the start of today’s briefing, but was asked specifically about the letter later on. \nSpicer said the White House certainly has a lot of respect for the life of Coretta Scott King and the sacrifices she made, but added, “I would respectfully disagree with her assessment of Senator Sessions then and now.” \nHe defended Sessions’ record on civil rights and said that he could “only hope that if she was with us today” and got to know Sessions and that record, she would be inclined to support him. \nKing was incredibly critical of Sessions in her 1986 letter, which is available to read here . \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:01:16.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
