The company opened their base in Stansted last month, and mainly use a fleet of seven An-124s, which have four engines rather than eight, for its regular operations. Its sole An-225 has made 11 trips to the UK using airports including RAF Brize Norton, Manchester, Prestwick and Doncaster-Sheffield. The 600 tonne An-225 was once was used to transport a Soviet space shuttle on its roof. It was designed and built in Ukraine in the 1980s and is used to move heavy cargoes, a recent example of which was an enormous 117 tonne power generator. Michael Goodisman, from the Antonov Airlines UK office, said: 'This is all about Antonov’s desire to engage with the West . . . and develop a closer relationship with the UK' Capable of carrying the the equivalent of ten British battle tanks, the aircraft has previously transported a 117 tonne electric generator (pictured) to a mining company in Perth The company opened their base in Stansted last month, and mainly use a fleet of seven An-124s, which have four engines rather than eight, for its regular operations The electric generator was picked up from the Czech Republic last May and delivered to an aluminium-ore mining company in western Australia, where it will be used to power large drills and excavating machinery. Measuring in at 84 yards long and with a wingspan of 88 yard - almost twice the width of a traditional football field - the plane has acted as a commercial transporter of oversized payloads for over two decades. Without a load, the colossal Antonov An-225 Mriya (Ukrainian for 'dream') can fly for up to 18 hours without stopping to refuel. The unloading phase of the generator on board could take up to 10 hours.
