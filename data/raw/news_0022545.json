Renganathan said the temple committee did not organise the fireworks which could have been set off by the devotees. \nHe said the procession of the silver chariot was delayed due to the downpour. \nGeorge Town OCPD Asst Comm Mior Faridalathrash Wahid was on hand to ensure the smooth flow of traffic and the departure of the chariots.
