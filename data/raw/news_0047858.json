Authorities search for evidence Sunday at the site of an explosion in Bogota, Colombia. Arwa Gunja \nThe blast comes amid ongoing — and sometimes violent — protests over bullfighting in Bogotá. The sport was outlawed in 2012, but three years later the country's highest court ended the ban, calling bullfighting a cultural heritage. \nThe sport resumed last month to large protests and a police response that included pepper spray and tear gas, The Guardian reported . \nA witness told NBC News that Sunday's blast, in the city's Macarena neighborhood, was strong enough to shatter glass on the 17th floor of a building across the street. \nReuters reported that most of the injured were police officers. In a Twitter post from a hospital, Peñalosa said four of them lost an eye.
