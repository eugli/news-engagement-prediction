The percentage varies by category, but it is usually on the order of five percent. \nCurrently, that percentage goes up whenever an affiliate hits a new volume threshold.

I expect in aggregate there will be a shift in what lines of business people decide to get into, based on this.\" A user called \"sharkweek\" said that \"[a]s an Amazon affiliate who has done quite well with it, this is definitely a gutting.\" The mood is equally grim on a subreddit for people building affiliate websites.
