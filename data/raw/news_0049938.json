The batting legend, nicknamed \"Sunny\", was adamant that the ball had hit his bat first and remonstrated with both Lillee and the umpire before reluctantly starting his walk from the crease while shaking his head vehemently. He instructed bemused fellow opener Chetan Chauhan to leave with him and the pair headed for the boundary. A swift intervention from then Indian manager Shahid Durrani prevented Chauhan from leaving the field which would have resulted in the visitors conceding the match and incurring a suspension. Gavaskar later said he regretted his \"inexcusable behaviour\". Watch the video below: \n\n\nIndian fans still rage about an umpiring decision during the 1999 Adelaide Test that saw the great Sachin Tendulkar dismissed effectively for \"shoulder before wicket\". The \"Little Master\" -- who stands at 5ft 4in (1.65m) -- attempted to duck a Glenn McGrath bouncer, only for the ball to keep low and hit his left shoulder. Home umpire Daryl Harper had no hesitation in giving Tendulkar out lbw. Some replays suggested the ball may have clipped the top of the stumps but most were inconclusive. Tendulkar was out for a duck and the reliably-partisan Indian media went apoplectic. The ever-gracious Tendulkar played down the decision, merely saying his dismissal was a bit disappointing. \n\nSachin Tendulkar ducks into a Glenn McGrath bouncer and is given out LBW for a duck at the Adelaide Oval.

Waugh was furious that Ganguly kept turning up late for the toss. Waugh wrote in his autobiography that he was \"wound up\" by the left-handed batsman's \"continued petulance\". Ganguly, nicknamed the Prince of Kolkata for the air of superiority that he carried on and off the field, initially maintained that his tardiness had been a mistake. Years later though he revealed that he had turned up a few minutes late on purpose each time to teach the Aussies a lesson for their rude behaviour. \n\nGanguly had turned up a few minutes late on purpose each time.

With tempers frayed because of a string of questionable umpiring decisions and on-field altercations, the \"Monkeygate\" scandal erupted -- almost causing the tour to be called off. Australia all-rounder Andrew Symonds accused spinner Harbhajan Singh of calling him a \"monkey\". Harbhajan, who denied any wrong-doing, was suspended for three matches for the alleged racist slur. The ban was overturned when India threatened to quit the tour, claiming Harbhajan had been wrongly accused. The allegations prompted India captain Anil Kumble to say that only one team was playing with the spirit of the game. Australia won the match and went on to take the series 2-1. \nHarbhajan Singh talks to the umpires at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Kohli was fielding in the deep when he was on the receiving end of some unpleasant chants from the famously vocal fans and responded by flashing the middle finger. It was caught on camera and Kohli, now captain, was fined 50 percent of his match fee for bringing the game into disrepute. He later defended his response on Twitter: \"I agree cricketers don't have to retaliate. what (sic) when the crowd says the worst things about your mother and sister. the worst I've heard.\" \nVirat Kohli gestures with his middle finger to the crowd at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
