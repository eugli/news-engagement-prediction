Kevin Brady no-show at Conroe town hall 1 / 5 Back to Gallery \nDozens of constituents in the southeast Texas congressional district represented by House Ways and Means chairman Kevin Brady held a town town hall meeting Saturday, which was not attended by the congressman though a glossy photograph of him occupied a chair. \nAbout 250 people packed a sixth-floor room at the Conroe Tower for a two-hour meeting that lacked an opportunity to discuss issues with the Republican from The Woodlands, but featured subject-matter experts who educated the crowd on the Affordable Care Act, immigration, education and activism. \nThe diverse group quickly organized this week through the Indivisible Guide, an online resource compiled by former Congressional staffers and progressive Internet meet-up groups. They secured a venue on Tuesday and had an invitation hand-delivered to an aide in the congressman's office. \nBrady spoke Friday afternoon about tax reform at the Conservative Political Action Conference, which was held at a Washington-area convention center. \nHis office released a statement explaining his absence: \"Unfortunately the Congressman cannot attend because of a long-standing invitation to be a keynote speaker at our nation's biggest gathering of conservative thinkers, CPAC. Due to his additional commitments tied to CPAC, his travel schedule could not be adjusted to accommodate this event to which he was just recently invited. During this district work week, he has met with a number of constituent groups and traveled to Austin to meet with key Texas leaders.\" \nKatie Pickard of Montgomery spoke on behalf of her family – which is covered by workplace insurance but has periodic large medical bill because her husband has an incurable, recurring form of cutaneous lymphoma. The 41-year-old said she's been counseled about \"the cap\" on lifetime benefits. The Affordable Care Act included a provision that prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions – whether they are covered by marketplace policies or not. \n\"I am a hard-working citizen who came to Texas because the economy was great. I am active in my church. I am a leader at my business. I'm a good mom. I dedicate my time to my school and I have a right to live out my days without bankruptcy,\" said Pickard, a software educator. \nBrady, who has congressional offices in Conroe and Huntsville, represents parts of Harris and Leon counties as well as Montgomery, San Jacinto, Grimes, Houston, Madison, Trinity and Walker counties in their entireties. \nSimilar town hall events without the representative have happened this week, which is the Congressional recess when many members of Congress return home to their districts. On Tuesday, a group held a demonstration outside the downtown Houston tower where U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, has an office. The Republican later spoke with some of the participants in a private meeting, but did not attend a town hall organized by the same group that evening.
