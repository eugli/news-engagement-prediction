Like, how do I keep my champagne chilled while climbing a 45-degree incline! Or will my savile row be out of place on an off-road trail! If you have had these doubts too, fret no more, for Mercedes has the answer. \nIt’s called the Mercedes-Maybach G 650 Landaulet and only 99 are being made. \nMercedes-Benz \nAnd Landaulet, if you’re wondering, is a car with a folding top for the rear seats. And they exist because, well, that’s what rich folks like you want. And just so you know, the fabric top one on this behemoth is operated at a press of a button. \nMercedes-Benz \nThe G 650 Landaulet will take up a bit of space in your garage – it is 5.3 metres long and 2.2 metres tall. There’s nearly half a metre of ground clearance so you can negotiate any and all the off-road tracks on the way to the links. \nMercedes-Benz \nBut rugged looks aside, there’s enough luxury here that you won’t be out of place at a gala event. There’s the Maybach badge – usually found on the most opulent of Mercedes cars. Then, there is electrically retractable ‘entry aid’ so you don’t spoil the crease of your expensive trousers just getting into the car. \nMercedes-Benz \nOn the inside, there are brushed aluminium bits and an electric partition that separates the passengers and the driver! As you can imagine, a great many cows were sacrificed in making the leather for those rear aircraft seats. Heck, even the table tops have leather inserts! The seats have an in-built massage function and there’s a calf rest for your tired feet. As regards the problem about your drinks, there are two ‘thermal cup holders’ to either heat or cool your drinks. \nMercedes-Benz \nIf one day you do feel like driving the thing yourself, you’d be happy to know that there’s a proper V12 engine under the bonnet with enough power to scare you silly. Just be careful with your right foot. Don't Miss ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:17:29.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
