We received anywhere from 60 cm to 80 cm … so certainly there was a significant amount of snow going into every driveway in the city.” \nREAD MORE: Moncton florists battle blizzard aftermath to deliver bouquets \nThe plow operator told the man he was just doing his job, and moved on, Walker said. \nWalker said he understands the homeowner’s frustration, and said he has had many conversations with residents making similar complaints. \nBut he said he has never seen anyone chase after a plow before. \nFredericton’s $2.3 million snow-clearing budget doesn’t allow for a level of service that would clear windrows from driveways after plows pass, he said. \n“That’s not a service level we provide. Certainly it’s not something we ask our operators to do – they have a tough enough job getting through their entire runs as it is,” Walker said. \n“We’re going to continue plowing the way that we plow.” © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:17:49.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
