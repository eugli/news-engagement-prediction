because of Granit Xhaka’s suspension, injuries to Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla, and Mohamed Elneny’s participation in the Africa Cup of Nations with finalists Egypt. \nAsked at the start of January why Arsenal had not inserted a recall clause in Wilshere’s loan deal at Bournemouth, Wenger revealed he did not know the rules by replying: “In the Premier League, it is season-long loans.” Jack Wilshere will be 200 miles away when Arsenal, with a lack of experienced midfielders, take on Chelsea on Saturday Credit: Peter Cziborra/Action Images \nI n contrast, Ake, who would have been starting alongside Wilshere at Goodison Park, can at best hope for a place on Chelsea’s substitutes’ bench on Saturday after being recalled from his Bournemouth loan. \nChelsea exercised their right to take Ake back with 24 hours of his recall clause, which lasted for the first seven days of the January transfer window, to spare after head coach Antonio Conte decided to take no chances over the strength of his squad for the run-in. \n“He gives me an important option because we are playing with three central defenders and he can play in the middle or at wing-back,” said Conte. Nathan Ake was recalled from loan by Chelsea Credit: Greig Cowie/BPI/REX/Shutterstock \nI n the simplest of terms, Chelsea have ensured they are as prepared as possible for every eventuality while Arsenal once again just hoped for the best and have been punished. \nIt is staggering that 25-year-old Wilshere was allowed to join Bournemouth for the season without having to extend his contract, which means he will have only a year remaining on his current deal when he returns to Arsenal in the summer. \nAke was made to sign a new five-year contract by Chelsea before joining Watford on loan in 2015 and there is every chance he will be offered another new deal before the end of this season with a number of clubs, including Bournemouth and Southampton, interested in signing him. Wilshere had 37 minutes of action for Arsenal in August Credit: EPA/WILL OLIVER \nH is form over the first half of the campaign at Bournemouth may well deserve it, but not too many people would have predicted 21-year-old Ake would be worth more than Wilshere at the end of this season. \nChelsea finished the January transfer window with 35 players out on loan and the talent factory is taken so seriously that even owner Roman Abramovich is sent video highlights of the club’s loanees. \nMore than one agent of a Chelsea loanee has been left surprised after being told that Abramovich is a fan of their player and being given a specific example of what has impressed the Russian billionaire. \nEddie Newton and Paolo Ferreira travel up and down the country and all over Europe checking on Chelsea’s loan players. Video clips are then sent out to Conte, youth team managers Adi Viveash and Jody Morris, technical director Michael Emenalo and Abramovich himself. 10 young players who Chelsea fans should be excited about this season \nS uch is their attention to detail, Newton and Ferreira will start their check on a player out on loan by visiting the club he is at on a Friday and meeting with his manager. They then might have dinner with the player himself on the Friday evening before watching him in action on Saturday and having a short post-match chat. \nA team of Chelsea analysts will sit in front of seven television screens and edit the performances of the loanees into video packages that get sent around the club and are watched by Abramovich, whether he is in the country or on his luxury yacht. \nGiven how infrequently he attends games to watch the first team, it is fair to assume that Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke will not be taking too much of a personal interest in how Wilshere has been getting on at Bournemouth. Watch | 'Abramovich is always right' 05:18 \nN ewton carries the title of ‘loan technical coach’ at Chelsea, but there is nobody with a similar job description at Arsenal and it has been left to 60-year-old Liam Brady, who returned in what was described as an ambassadorial role in 2015, to keep an eye on Wilshere and Co who are playing elsewhere. \nBrady is more likely to go and watch one of Arsenal’s loan players in action and have a short chat with him after the game than make the kind of detailed checks Newton and Ferreira carry out on a weekly basis. \nIt is, therefore, perfectly possible that Wenger had not been properly briefed on the loan rules, which would have allowed Arsenal a recall clause on Wilshere to cover the eventuality they now find themselves in. \nPremier League titles can be decided on the smallest of margins, but there is a huge gulf in the way Chelsea and Arsenal have approached the situations regarding Ake and Wilshere. \nOne club has been ruthlessly professional, the other has allowed things to tick over and see what happens. The same could be said of the managers and players for both Chelsea and Arsenal, which is exactly why Conte’s men are so far ahead.
