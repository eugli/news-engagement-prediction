Umar and Amna Raja outside their new unit The Meating Room \nThe 25-seater restaurant will not have a bar, instead diners can choose from a range of alcohol-free cocktails and Raja may implement a BYOB policy in the future. \nThe menu - which is available from breakfast right through until the evening - will be priced from around £5-6 per dish, with sides and extras costing a little more.

It might give other people the motivation to try something different if this works.\" \n\"It has changed a lot; you get a lot more nice and professional people moving here. Maybe a few more nice eating places and bars will bring more nice people here.\" \nThis is the first food venture for Raja, who is testing the water by offering a series of free tasting sessions in the coming weeks. Visitors can snap up samples of the menu, including gourmet cheese toasties and burgers in exchange for offering some feedback. \nOpening dates for The Meating Room are still to be confirmed; check back on @CityLifeManc for more information on the launch.
