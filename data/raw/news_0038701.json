One, identified as 28-year-old John Jones, later died.\nInvestigators learned there was a disturbance between Jones and another man. During that disturbance, police say Jones allegedly shot the man he was arguing with, at which time another person nearby shot Jones.\nThe man shot by Jones is still in the hospital in critical but stable condition, according to police.
