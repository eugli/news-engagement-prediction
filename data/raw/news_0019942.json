Oh, keep secrets from me Nat. No need to lie. No need to be deceitful,” said Malkah. \n“Oh my gosh, Tziporah, seriously? Every single day you have a little fight with someone,” said an exasperated Bassingthwaighte. \n“Who do I fight with everyday?” \n“Well you’re doing it right now,” Pollard pointed out. \n“But Nat always picks on me, so …” \n“Oh my GOD! I always pick on you? That’s the funniest thing I’ve ever heard,” sighed Bassingthwaighte. Nat Bass can’t hide her exasperation with Tziporah. Source: Channel 10 \nSpeaking to Curry and beauty queen Tegan Martin after the incident, Bassingthwaighte said she was reaching her limit with Malkah. \n“She’s saying I’m attacking her, but I feel like she’s attacking me,” she told them. \n“There’s a reason why everyone else is talking about her,” said Martin. \n“You’re not a crazy person. You’ve got eleven other people here backing you up,” said Curry, before Bassingthwaighte delivered her ultimatum: “If it continues, I’m definitely not going to stay here. I can’t deal with it.” \nCurry approached Malkah outside of camp to see if she could help smooth things over — but was left shocked when the former ’90s covergirl instead slammed Bassingthwaighte’s looks and intelligence. \n“Nat does tend to overreact to me. I know she’s not very bright,” Malkah told Curry, who suggested the pair “hug it out”. Malkah left Lisa Curry stunned with her harsh words about Nat Bass. Source: Channel 10 \n“I don’t want to, I don’t like her. She’s always at me,” said Malkah. \n“It’s just, sometimes you get a bit sensitive. Sensitive and a bit fragile,” said Curry. \n“But you could light a match off Nat’s face. She’s as hard as flint. She pretends she’s all cute and bouncy but she’s not.” \nTziporah also intimated she was ready to leave later on in last night’s episode, tearfully telling Jay Laga’aia she was sick of her fellow female campmates — and singling out Curry in particular. \n“I want to go home. I am f***ing sick of these bitches that don’t understand me. I’ve had a very strange life with lots of ups and downs. I am sick of people like f***ing Lisa.” \nI’m A Celeb screens 7:30pm tonight on Ten.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:53:38.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
