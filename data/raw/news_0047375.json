Supplied \nHaji Abu Bakar Ramil had lived with his family in New Plymouth for eight years, after travelling over from Malaysia. \n\"The whole thing happened slowly ... like slow motion. I saw him skid, then the other car came from around the bend and they hit each other, then he [her father] hit a bank,\" she said. \nREAD MORE: \n\"We stopped on the side of the road and ran over to him to try get him out.
