In a message posted to social media, Rosie Ayliffe, the mother of Mia Ayliffe-Chung, says President Donald Trump used an attack at a backpacking hostel in Queensland last August to bolster his claim that the media was underreporting terrorist attacks . Ayliffe-Chung and Thomas Jackson were stabbed to death by a French national in an event that local authorities said was unrelated to terrorism . . @realDonaldTrump An open letter regarding the deaths of the heroic Tom Jackson and my daughter, Mia Ayliffe-Chung: pic.twitter.com/e4oK5eey0H — Rosie Ayliffe (@RosieAyliffe) February 7, 2017 “This vilification of whole nation states and their people based on religion is a terrifying reminder of the horror that can ensue when we allow ourselves to be led by ignorant people into darkness and hatred,” Ayliffe wrote in a Facebook post, which she later shared on Twitter . “My daughter’s death will not be used to further this insane persecution of innocent people.” Her comments came less than a day after Trump told military leaders gathered at U.S. Central Command that the Western media was intentionally under-covering violent terrorist attacks: “They have their reasons,” Trump said. “It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported. And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it,” Trump said in the off-script remarks . Ayliffe-Chung’s murder captivated the Australian press, and although initial reports linked the event to religious extremism, authorities found no evidence to link the attack to terrorism . Sandra Jackson, the mother of the other victim in the attack, also condemned Trump on Twitter, calling the U.S. president “a disgrace.” @realDonaldTrump wake up this morning to see you've used my Son murder to further your campaign of hate, how dare you. You are a disgrace. — Sandra Jackson (@sandrajackson11) February 7, 2017 “I’m pretty sure he and his advisors know full well — or could very easily verify — that Tom and Mia died not as the result of an act of terror but rather through the actions of a disturbed individual,” Jackson’s father, Les, wrote on Facebook . “Of course, that doesn’t suit his agenda.” The White House’s curated list of 78 attacks ― which it said comprised “ISIS or ISIS-related attacks on Western targets from [2014-16], ***MOST*** of which were not widely reported on” ― included several well-known events widely covered by the press. The attacks in San Bernardino , California, the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando , Florida, and the bombings in Paris were all listed, as were killings in Nice , Brussels and Ottawa .
