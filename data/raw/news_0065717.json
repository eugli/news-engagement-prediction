By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Friday, February 24, 2017 - 16:21 0 Follow @ZeeNewsSports \nNew Delhi: On the eve of IPL 10 auction, cricket fans were left stunned as Rising Pune Supergiants (RPS) decided to remove MS Dhoni as the captain of the team, announcing the name of Steve Smith as the skipper for new season. \nWhile many reports claimed that Dhoni was supportive of the decision, he surely didn't see this coming and the following video confirms just that. \nDhoni had said so during India A's warm-up game with England XI ahead of the start of the ODI series between the two nations. The game was widely touted as Dhoni's last as skipper, but he himself said that he will still be captaining his IPL team and the Jharkhand team. \nAs the current scenario stands, his captaincy stints will only be seen for Jharkhand as long as he stays with the Pune franchise.
