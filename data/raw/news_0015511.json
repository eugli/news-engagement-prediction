The scanners work by shining a laser beam into the head, and take around three minutes to finish the scan, in comparison an MRI scan of the bran takes between 20 and 45 minutes to complete. The equipment will be used for the first time at a BIBA sanctioned event in Bradford on February 26th, and it is hoped that there will be ten units in operation in 2018. It should be noted however that the British Boxing Board of Control, which sanctions most professional bouts in the UK, doesn't recognise the BIBA, and instead will continue with its own investigations into brain injuries, though the equipment will be offered for use for any BBBoC fighter by the BIBA. Scottish boxer Mike Towell (left) died from a bleed on the brain after a fight last September Even if the equipment doesn't get used in BBBoC sanctioned fights, hopefully this will mark a significant step in the fight against brain injuries in boxing, and will begin to improve the safety of those stepping into the ring. The news comes as Blackwell continues to recover from a second brain injury sustained in an unsanctioned sparring contest, which took place as the middleweight attempted to restart his career with an Irish boxing licence, and it is hoped that the new equipment will be the first move in eradicating incidents like this from the sport. In a statement on their website, BIBA vice president Gianluca Di Caro said: 'We are extremely proud to be the first to introduce Infra-Scanners at events in the United Kingdom and Ireland, as we whole heartedly believe having them ringside will significantly prevent further tragedies within our sport. 'We have initially ordered two Infra-Scanners which will be operated by Professor Graham and Dr Eccles at our events, and are aiming to order a further eight units over the coming twelve months, so that every BIBA Ringside Doctor will have an Infra-Scanner available by 2018. Nick Blackwell was placed in a medically-induced coma after suffering a similar injury 'Following two major head injury incidents last year, one that resulted in the death of Mike Towell, even though neither were on events sanctioned by ourselves, the BIBA board had decided to actively seek solutions regarding improving the way that injuries such as these can be detected as quickly as possible.' Mike Towell was a Scottish welterweight who lost his life at just 25 years old after a brain bleed suffered in his fight with Dale Evans, in which he was stopped in the fifth round. Towell was rushed to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital but died from his injuries just hours later. It is hoped that if this equipment becomes commonly used, fighters will be able to be withdrawn from fights before it's too late, thus preventing the risk of serious injury. Towell's girlfriend Chloe Ross praised the introduction of these scanners, posting on Facebook: 'I'm glad to be finally seeing something good coming from what happened to Michael. It shouldn't take someone's life for these things to be used but if it saves someone else's life then that can only be a good thing.'
