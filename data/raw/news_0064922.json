Credit Kuala Lumpur International Airport, via Fuji TV KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — The two young women were what South Korean intelligence calls “lizard’s tails,” expendable assets to be cast off after an operation. Guided by North Korean agents, they practiced at malls in Kuala Lumpur, then set their sights on their target: the estranged elder brother of North Korea’s erratic leader, Kim Jong-un. With hands doused with toxic liquid, they rubbed the face of their victim, who was waiting to check in for a flight at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Minutes later, their target died on the way to a hospital. The two women washed their hands and fled. The suspected assassins — one from Vietnam, the other from Indonesia — were swiftly taken into custody as circumstantial evidence mounted that North Korea was responsible for the attack. Continue reading the main story The very public killing of Mr. Kim appears to be another remarkable episode in the annals of bizarre North Korean behavior, a whodunit with geopolitical implications. Speculation swirled that the victim, Kim Jong-nam, had been killed to remove him from the line of succession in North Korea. He has long been on a hit list drawn up by his half brother, according to South Korean intelligence, and his death could complicate North Korea’s relations with its main ally, China. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story North Korea has denied any involvement in the killing, which is likely to anger Beijing. The Chinese government is thought to have long protected Kim Jong-nam. Kim Jong-un, 33, who has ordered the execution of scores of senior officials, including at least one disfavored relative, may have been prompted to act if he believed that Beijing saw his half brother as a possible replacement for him. Malaysian authorities say the two women arrested, Doan Thi Huong, 28, and Siti Aisyah, 25, were recruited, trained and equipped by four North Koreans, who have since fled to their home country.

A seventh North Korean, who was not identified, was also being sought. Mr. Khalid also said that extra police officers had been sent to the morgue where Mr. Kim’s body was being kept after an attempt to break into the facility was detected. North Korea has refused to even acknowledge that the dead man was Kim Jong-nam and has accused Malaysia of carrying out a politically motivated investigation to placate South Korea and the United States. North Korea has nonetheless demanded that the body be sent to North Korea and, in a statement on Wednesday, the North Korean Embassy said the two women were innocent and should be freed. If the women really had poison on their hands, the embassy statement said, “then how is it possible that these female suspects could still be alive?” One possible theory to answer that question could be that each woman used a single chemical that became lethal only when mixed with another. However, Malaysian police said the substance, or substances, used in the attack was still unknown. If the attack was a plot by North Korea, it would not be the first time it had tried to kill Kim Jong-nam. \nAdvertisement In 2010, according to South Korean investigators, a North Korean agent based in China received a special order from Pyongyang: “terminate” Kim Jong-nam and bring his body to the North.

Credit European Pressphoto Agency The agent, Kim Young-soo, was told that Kim Jong-nam was going to travel to China from Singapore, where he was then living. The agent’s boss gave him a bundle of cash and ordered him to bribe a taxi driver to run over Mr. Kim in a fake traffic accident. The plot was scrapped when Mr. Kim failed to arrive as planned. But it came to light in 2012, when the agent was caught entering South Korea and confessed under interrogation. Since 2011, when Kim Jong-un succeeded his father as North Korea’s ruler, there has been a standing order to assassinate his half brother, South Korean intelligence officials said last week. There was another assassination attempt against him in 2012. Mr. Kim was so afraid that he begged for his life in a letter to his half brother in 2012. “Please withdraw the order to punish me and my family,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying in the letter. “We have nowhere to hide. The only way to escape is to choose suicide.” A Troubled Family The Kim family, which has ruled North Korea since its founding in 1948, has presided over a Shakespearean nest of internecine plots and family intrigue, with rival relatives sent into exile and occasional bloody purges to kill off anyone of questionable loyalty and set an example for others. Kim Jong-nam was an early dropout in the Kim dynasty’s third-generation power struggle. Sidelined from the race to succeed his father since the 1970s, when his mother was abandoned by his father, he had been effectively shut out of power, and shut off from his father, since he was a teenager. South Korean officials say he never met his half brother, Kim Jong-un. The final straw for Kim Jong-nam was when he was caught entering Japan on a false Dominican Republic passport in 2001, embarrassing the family. He told Japanese officials that he had wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. Photo Oceanfront villas in Macau, one of which is believed to belong to Kim Jong-nam. Mr. Kim lived in exile, mostly in Macau.

While his father was still alive, the government in Pyongyang sent him cash allowances. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story His uncle, Jang Song-thaek, became a father figure and his main connection to his country. South Korean officials said Mr. Kim was thought to have used that connection to conduct business for himself, like handling contracts involving North Korean minerals. Mr. Kim often visited Kuala Lumpur, where Mr. Jang’s nephew, Jang Yong-chol, served as North Korean ambassador until 2013. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.
