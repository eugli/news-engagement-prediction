There has also been a spike in the numbers crossing into Manitoba and British Columbia. \nImmigration lawyer Chantal Desloges told CTV’s Power Play Monday that many of those who landed in the United States legally before entering Canada, “would have all of the appropriate security screening to the point that Canada probably does not need to be hypervigilant about them.” \nEven if they had come into the U.S. surreptitiously, according to Desloges, “when someone makes a refugee claim in Canada, the first thing Canada does is a pretty comprehensive security check on them.” \nThose who make refugee claims can expect hearing within 60 days, where an adjudicator decides whether the claimants have “a well-founded fear or persecution or not,” according to Desloges. \nIf their claims fail, they can appeal. If those appeals fail, they can seek judicial reviews by a federal court. Eventually, they may be ordered deported to their country of origin, according to Desloges. \nDesloges urged people not to pre-judge the refugee claimants. “If you look at where the majority of them are from, they are from refugee-producing countries like Somalia, for example, which has a very high acceptance rate in Canada,” she said. \n“So on the face of it, it seems like they may indeed be legitimate refugees very uncomfortable with the situation in the United States and (who) are not feeling like they’re going to get a fair hearing.” \nDesloges said she expects to see “a lot more” border crossers as winter turns to spring. \nWith a report from CTV Montreal’s Annie Demelt Related Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:07:25.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
