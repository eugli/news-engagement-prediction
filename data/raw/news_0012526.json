Staff Writers, FOX SPORTS February 5, 2017 11:19am \nANDREW Bogut‚Äôs expiring contract is one of the hottest assets in the NBA, with the Cleveland Cavaliers emerging as the latest team that‚Äôs interested in the Australian. \nAlso in NBA trade and acquisition news, one of the league‚Äôs brightest big-men looks set to make his return to the league, while the Chicago Bulls edge closer and closer toward a massive shake-up. \nHere‚Äôs all of the chatter you need to know! \nCAVALIERS SHOWING INTEREST IN BOGUT \nThe Cavaliers are desperately trying to tend to their playmaking and depth issues, and it appears Bogut has emerged as a candidate. \nAccording to ESPN‚Äôs Marc Stein , the defending champions are interested in acquiring Bogut to bolster their bench. media_camera The Cleveland Cavaliers are reportedly chasing Andrew Bogut. \nThe report claims that the Cavaliers understand how difficult it would be to take on Bogut‚Äôs big contract, so they‚Äôll be hoping the Dallas Mavericks buy out the 32-year-old‚Äôs contract after the February 24 (AEDT) trade deadline. \nBogut‚Äôs teammate, Deron Williams, as well as Los Angeles Lakers guard Jose Calderon have also been tabbed as players the Cavaliers have shown interest in. \nAnalysis \nFrom an on-court perspective, having Bogut come off the bench would absolutely bolster the Cavs. He has the ability to be somewhat of a playmaker for the team‚Äôs second unit, while giving Tyronn Lue the ability to give Tristan Thompson some more, well-deserved rest. \nPragmatically, though, it seems extremely improbable that the Cavs would have the assets to trade for Bogut. While it would be exciting to have an Australian play in another NBA Finals ‚Äî which would likely be the case if this transaction somehow occurred ‚Äî it‚Äôs unlikely, at this point. media_camera Andrew Bogut took on the Cleveland Cavaliers with the Golden State Warriors in the last NBA Finals. \nLARRY SANDERS IS ON THE COMEBACK TRAIL \nAfter taking a two year hiatus while dealing with anxiety and depression, Larry Sanders appears ready to return to the NBA. \nThe centre tweeted about his intentions last week: Officially stepping back into the game,looking for a good fit but it shouldn't be long now,I really missed the game,I think it missed me 2 üõê ‚Äî Larry Sanders (@l8show_thegoat) January 27, 2017 \nAccording to Sanders‚Äô Snapchat, he took visits to Boston, Houston, and Miami for workouts, and will continue to work in Miami, while giving every NBA team the chance to see him. \n‚ÄúBy the end of next week, we should have a reasonably good handle on where this is going,‚Äù Sanders‚Äô agent Joel Bell told Gery Woelfel of The Journal Times. \n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been training for about six months now. Physically, he‚Äôs almost there. Mentally and spiritually, he is there. He doesn‚Äôt need to come back; he wants to come back to the NBA. Sometimes you don‚Äôt miss something until you don‚Äôt have it.‚Äù \nAnalysis \nAfter what Sanders went through, personally, this is only a good thing. media_camera Larry Sanders (right) appears ready to return to the NBA after a two-year hiatus. \nWILL THE CHICAGO BULLS BRING JAHLIL OKAFOR HOME? \nThe Chicago Bulls and Jahlil Okafor are two parties that haven‚Äôt had a great season. \nSo, now it‚Äôs emerged that the Bulls are seeking to trade for the Chicago boy. \nAccording to Vincent Goodwill of CSN Chicago , the Bulls have called the 76ers, asking about the availability of Okafor. \nThe report says that, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs more interest on the Bulls‚Äô side than the 76ers‚Äô side, according to sources.‚Äù \nAt this point, there doesn‚Äôt appear to be any real trade in place, but, with the Bulls wanting to shake things up, and the 76ers needing to get rid of one of their big-men, it‚Äôs possible a deal could develop. \nAnalysis \nOkafor was a No. 3 overall pick, led Duke to a national championship, and has an impressive skill-set, so he could make himself fit with most teams in the league. Unfortunately, when you look at what the Bulls front office has done over the past few years, this doesn‚Äôt look like more than a publicity stunt ‚Äî attempting to bring the Chicago boy home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:33:08.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
