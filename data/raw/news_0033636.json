(Jose Osorio / Chicago Tribune) John Byrne on Tuesday said federal officials will soon come to Chicago to continue work with the Police Department after a major report last month found systemic problems at the department.\nEmanuel met Monday in Washington, D.C. with senior members of President Donald Trump 's administration, among them new Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Asked Tuesday whether a federal consent decree for the Chicago Police Department came up in their conversation, the mayor didn't say. \nInstead, Emanuel talked about ongoing work with Justice Department officials in response to the findings they released days before Trump's inauguration. \n\"I don't know if you know this, the Justice Department is going to be here next week, meeting with our people consistent with the consent decree, and starting those conversations and continuing those conversations,\" Emanuel said. \"We plan on continuing to build it.\" \nThe mayor then pivoted to talk about the type of federal help he requested from Trump advisers, a list he has repeatedly cited in response to the president's tweet last month threatening to \"send in the Feds!\" to Chicago if the city doesn't get its violence under control. \n\"My purpose of my meeting was to go out and see, be very explicit, that if you're talking about federal help, this is what we mean by federal help, from law enforcement cooperation and participation, to investing in kids, to prosecuting gun crimes, to economic development in our neighborhoods, in our areas,\" he said.

(Juan Perez Jr.) \nEmanuel last month said he agreed to enter talks toward a court-enforced agreement on a number of policing reforms with then-President Barack Obama's Justice Department. A consent decree would allow the courts to enforce a set of Police Department reforms in response to the Justice Department civil rights investigation that criticized the city's police force. The report concluded officers were poorly trained and quick to use excessive force â€” often against African-Americans and Latinos. \nBut Sessions has been critical of consent decrees in the past. And Trump has supported aggressive law enforcement to fight crime, specifically in Chicago. So it's far from certain the new administration in Washington would support such an agreement. \nAlso Tuesday, Emanuel said he told Trump administration officials they should make a federal investment in renovations to the CTA Green Line. The line carries trains from Harlem Avenue and Lake Street on the West Side, through downtown to two South Side stations on 63rd Street.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:40:44.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
