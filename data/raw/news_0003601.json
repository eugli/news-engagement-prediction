On returning to New York, she took a course with the German art theorist Rudolf Arnheim at the New School. Her plan to study comparative literature at Yale failed to take into account the department’s requirement that entering students know Latin and Greek. Instead, she accepted a scholarship to study art history at Harvard, where she earned a master’s degree in 1950. In 1953 she married the Latvian-born abstract painter Adja Yunkers . The marriage ended in divorce. Her second husband, Matti Megged, died in 2003. In addition to her daughter Paris, she is survived by another daughter, Sasha Alexandra Yunkers, and a grandson. After leaving Harvard, Ms. Ashton began writing reviews for Art Digest, which soon hired her as an associate editor. In making her gallery rounds, she struck up an acquaintance with Howard Devree, the art news editor of The Times, who in 1955 offered her a job as a reviewer. A tireless champion of new art, Ms. Ashton ran afoul of John Canaday, a staunch anti-Modernist, who became the newspaper’s art news editor and chief critic in 1959. In a blistering memo, he accused her of writing to an artistic clique and cheerleading for it. “Her answer, placed on Canaday’s desk on Monday morning, was a diatribe, reviling her boss with references to Zenocrates and Zola, and throwing back at him his own published words,” Sophy Burnham wrote in “The Art Crowd” (1973). A bitter fight ensued, and Ms. Ashton left the newspaper in November 1960. Enlisting the support of fellow critics, including Harold Rosenberg, Meyer Schapiro and Leo Steinberg, she succeeded in putting the matter before the International Association of Art Critics, which censured Mr. Canaday for “infringing basic principles of freedom of criticism.” After leaving The Times, Ms. Ashton, who lived in Manhattan, taught art history at the School of Visual Arts, Cooper Union and the New School, while generating a stream of articles, exhibition catalogs, monographs and biographies. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Her many works also include “A Reading of Modern Art” (1969), “A Fable of Modern Art” (1980), “American Art Since 1945” (1982) and “Noguchi East and West” (1992). Many of her essays were collected in “Out of the Whirlwind: Three Decades of Arts Commentary” (1987), edited by Donald Kuspit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T04:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:05:37.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
