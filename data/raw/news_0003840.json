It seems only natural to expect that such a process would simply favour genes that help themselves and not others. Yet cooperative ... Early onset of winter triggers evolution towards smaller snow voles in Graubunden January 26, 2017 \nResearchers from the University of Zurich have succeeded in documenting an extremely rare case of evolutionary adaptation 'in action' among wild snow voles near Chur. The selective pressure triggered by several consecutive ... New insights into the evolution of cooperation in spatially structured populations August 11, 2016 \nResearchers have analyzed a new mathematical model to investigate how a population's spatial structure affects the evolution of cooperation. Jorge Peña of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Plön, Germany, ... Mathematicians offer elegant solution to evolutionary conundrum April 22, 2010 \nUBC researchers have proffered a new mathematical model that seeks to unravel a key evolutionary riddle--namely what factors underlie the generation of biological diversity both within and between species. How to create less selfish societies? February 6, 2009 \n(GPEARI, Portugal) -- Cooperation, despite being now considered the third force of evolution, just behind mutation and natural selection, is difficult to explain in the context of an evolutionary process based on competition ... Biologists identify genes that prevent changes in physical traits due to environmental changes November 4, 2008 \nNew York University biologists have identified genes that prevent physical traits from being affected by environmental changes. The research, which studied the genetic makeup of baker's yeast, appears in the latest issue ... Recommended for you Study finds mutual reinforcement of phenotypic diversity and cooperation February 3, 2017 \nA new model exploring how evolutionary dynamics work in natural selection has found that phenotypic diversity, or an organism's observable traits, co-evolves with contingent cooperation when organisms with like traits work ... Engineered bacteria produce rare and commercially useful compounds in large quantities February 3, 2017 \nUsing advanced fermentation technology, industrial biotech startup Manus Bio hopes to make manufacturing flavors, fragrances, and other products greener and more cost-effective—and maybe create new products in the process. Fish found to communicate with one another using urine February 2, 2017 \n(Phys.org)—A trio of researchers with the University of Bern in Switzerland has found that at least one species of fish communicates with others of its kind using chemicals in its urine. In their paper published in the ... World's tiniest hammer helps researchers see what happens when force is applied to brain cells February 2, 2017 \nWe're all pretty familiar with what happens when we sustain a knock on the head: First, the all-too-audible crack, accompanied perhaps by a moment of surprise. Then, the swelling and, if we're lucky, just a minor bump or ... Protein chaperone takes its job seriously February 2, 2017 \nFor proteins, this would be the equivalent of the red-carpet treatment: each protein belonging to the complex machinery of ribosomes—components of the cell that produce proteins—has its own chaperone to guide it to the ... Researchers engineer new thyroid cells February 2, 2017 \nResearchers have discovered a new efficient way to generate thyroid cells, known as thyrocytes, using genetically modified embryonic stem cells.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:25:11.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
