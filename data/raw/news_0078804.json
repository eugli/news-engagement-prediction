(Getty Images) \nUpdated at 1:22 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 1:22 a.m. ET \nThe weight of perfection wore on the Gonzaga Bulldogs. They all but left footprints on the court at the McCarthey Athletic Center as those final excruciating minutes drained away. In a sense, they had nothing left to win. There only was something to lose. And the Zags played like it. \nIn their final scheduled game of the 2016-17 season, the Zags had the chance to become the third team in four years to finish the regular season undefeated. Many figured that was a given, since Gonzaga had won easily on the road at BYU earlier this month. \nThe Cougars insisted they earn it, though, and the Zags were not up to the job. \nMORE: Final Four records that will never be broken \nWith BYU center Erik Mika scoring 29 points and grabbing 11 rebounds, the Cougars defeated No. 1 Gonzaga, 79-71. This was the biggest of their five wins over a ranked Zags team since the 2011-12 season. \n“We’ve got to figure it out and do it to other teams and we’ll be all right,” Mika told ESPN. \nThe perfect season might not be all Gonzaga loses now. If the Bulldogs (29-1) fail to win the championship of the West Coast Conference next week in Las Vegas, it’s likely they’ll tumble to a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament behind the champion of the Pac-12 Tournament. \nWhat happened Saturday is why it’s always silly to dismiss the difficulty of achieving an undefeated season, whether it’s UNLV playing in the Big West in 1991 or Wichita State playing in the Missouri Valley in 2014 or Gonzaga nearly doing it in the West Coast Conference this season. Until you’ve made it all the way to the end, you haven’t. \nGonzaga began this game with an 18-2 surge that figured to chase BYU all the way back to Provo. Instead, the Cougars rallied to trail by six at half, withstood an early second-half surge that stretched it back to 12 points and made it a back-and-forth game in the final 10 minutes. \nThe Zags showed their discomfort in such a close game, one of their few since early in the season, by failing to get the ball in the hands of key players such as center Przemek Karnowski and point guard Nigel Williams-Goss in the final two minutes. \nMORE: This is the year the Zags make the Final Four \nPower forward Johnathan Williams attempted a shot with 91 seconds left that could have given Gonzaga the lead, and after Mika hit a foul-line jumper to put BYU ahead, Gonzaga wing Josh Perkins committed a turnover as Williams-Goss was a mere spectator on the play. Perkins gave up the ball again on a last-gasp effort with the Zags trailing by four with 15 seconds left. \n“We left a lot hanging out there,” Gonzaga coach Mark Few said in his press conference. \nThe Zags committed 16 turnovers. They shot 55 percent from the foul line. They were only 3 of 16 on 3-pointers. They earned this defeat. \nThere are those who will tell you Gonzaga needed to lose to be more free to pursue the NCAA Championship without concern about maintaining an undefeated record. We will remind you that it’s been longer since a 1-loss team (N.C. State, 1974) earned the title than since an undefeated team (Indiana, 1976). \nAnd we will reiterate that one more defeat could cost Gonzaga a No. 1 NCAA seed. \nThere is a price to pay for imperfection.
