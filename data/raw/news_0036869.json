(ABC News) \n\"We're talking about trainee teachers and we're talking about existing teachers. \n\"It's not about money, it's about a cultural change. You really do need to change management process, we need to upskill our teachers and our principals, we need to do it at the local school, we need to do it at training institutions.\" \nMr Breen said parents, teachers, child health experts and advocates should be brought together to determine what was best for each of these children, including the possibility of home schooling, with the department's support. \n\"Let's have an education assistant who can actually work in the school and at home. And if they go home, they go home and still do their school work,\" he said. Education funding doesn't cover at home care \nMs O'Neill said that was not possible under the School Education Act which funded the department for education and care at school, not at home. \nExemptions were made mainly for severely ill children, who accessed distance education from home and took lessons over the internet. \nShe said if a student with a disability was not managing at school, the department had other highly specialised schools and programs that could be adjusted, in cooperation with the parents, to meet their needs. \n\"There are other ways that we can offer services. It's not just, do you fit in at school, are you having trouble at school, therefore you need to be in the home,\" she said. \nDevelopmental Disability WA chief executive officer Taryn Harvey believed momentum towards inclusion in schools had stalled. \nShe said the education department needed to ensure parents had strong advocates to help meet their children's needs, and educators needed a greater capacity to respond to the diverse needs of children with disabilities and their families. \n\"If you've got families who have been traumatised by their experience at school, or have not had positive and constructive and strengthening relationships with their schools, they then take a lot of that anxiety and distress and frustration into the next round of negotiations that they have to have as they continue to support their kids across their life course,\" Ms Harvey said. \nMs O'Neill encouraged teachers to always listen to what parents told them about their children. \n\"We all want what's best for these kids, many of whom do it tough. And we're all on the same page,\" she said. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:30:35.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
