Police found him unconscious on a couch on the main floor of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. \nFart members told police the sophomore was intoxicated when he fell down the basement stairs at about 11 p.m. the night before during a party. Dauphin County Coroner Graham Hetrick said Tuesday that Piazza’s fall was accidental and he sustained multiple traumatic injuries from the fall, according to Fox 43 . \nThe fraternity has been suspended, but police say its members are cooperating. \n“This cease-and-desist means the chapter is prohibited from hosting or participating in any fraternity or sorority activities social or otherwise, including any new member or pledging activities,” Penn State spokeswoman Lisa Powers said in a statement, per Centre Daily . \n“It is no longer considered a recognized student organization at this point in time.” \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
