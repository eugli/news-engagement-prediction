Hospital (Photo: PA) \nIn December, just 86.2% of patients were admitted, transferred or discharged from A&E within four hours of arrival, below the 95%target. This was the worst performance since records began in August 2010, and figures leaked to the BBC suggest Januaryâ€™s figures are set to be even worse. \nThere were 550 people who had trolley waits of 12 hour or more from decision to admit to admission, the highest number since 650 in January 2015. \nThe standard of 95% of patients spending 4 hours or less in A&E was last achieved in July 2015. \nSeven of the eight targets for cancer patients were met. But one target has now not been met for an entire year. \nThe 85% standard for 62 day cancer waiting times was not met, with 83% of patients beginning a first definitive treatment within 62 days from an urgent GP referral for suspected cancer.

Experts are saying that standards are being pushed back 15 years or more. Behind each of these statistics is a patient suffering and in unacceptable discomfort. It's making Theresa May's utter disregard for the dire state of the NHS all the more disgraceful.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:08:42.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
