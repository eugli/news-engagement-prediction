Science takes human supernormal abilities seriously now-exciting stuff. Marvel's Best by Emerson Sterner We haven't seen Marvel turn out a great origin story since Phase 2 ended with Ant Man. Now they've delivered another megahit that is sure to be ranked best sci-fi movie of the year, maybe even shoud be considered for the Oscars. With the best visual effects that I've seen in recent years, a solid cast, an excellent story line and a director who has the spirit of Marvel at heart...this film is sure to be ranked as one of Marvel's very best. We need to talk by Todgkgdogkepudlhepudyepypz Ok, so....this movie isn't the best Marvel movie....and it ain't gonna win best picture, BUT it was what it needed to be; this is the first MCU movie with actual MAGIC and crap like the comics...I'm glad Marvel's finally doing this...OH, and the CGI is AMAZING....the CGI should win the Oscar for best visual effects (or at least be nominated for it)ðŸ˜‚Thanks for listening", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:10:31.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
