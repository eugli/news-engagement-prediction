Will the ban affect fight against IS? US travel ban: Why these seven countries? What is an executive order? Trump's first week: Well, that was intense Speaking at a news conference, the heads of the department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said 720 people had been detained and \"humanely processed\" since Mr Trump's executive order had been issued.\nCBP chief Kevin McAleenan acknowledged that communications \"publicly and inter-agency haven't been the best\" as the policy was rolled out.\nJohn Kelly - this is not a ban on Muslims He also said that although the order had suspended the US refugee programme, 872 refugees had been granted waivers and were due to arrive in the US this week because they had been ready to travel and preventing them from doing so would have caused undue hardship.\nHomeland Security chief John Kelly denied that President Trump's order - which affects people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - amounted to a ban on Muslims and said the vast majority of the world's Muslims still had access to the US.\nHe said the 90-day order would give officials time to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the US immigration system, something he said was \"long overdue\".\n\"Some of those countries may not be taken off the list any time soon. They are countries that are in various states of collapse,\" he said.\nMr Trump's policy had led to big protests The US was also considering examining the web browsing history, mobile phone contacts and social media profiles of visa applicants from countries where there was little confidence in local law enforcement agencies, he said.\nMr McAleenan offered some clarification on how dual citizens were affected, saying the US authorities would handle people based on the passport they were travelling on.\nSeveral governments - including the UK, Canada and Switzerland - have already said that their citizens who are also citizens of the seven countries affected by the ban are free to travel to the US.\nMr Ryan said he was confident that the policy would now be \"done correctly\" and would impose the \"kind of vetting standards that we all want to see\".\n\"No-one wanted to see people with Green Cards or special immigrant visas, like translators, get caught up in all of this,\" he said.\nHowever, new UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said closing borders to people based on their religion, ethnicity or nationality was a \"blind\" measure.\nIt risked handing a propaganda victory to extremists and was easily bypassed by today's sophisticated terrorist organisations, he said.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9005/production/_93896863_mediaitem93896862.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/16A39/production/_93892729_mediaitem93892728.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38802673"], "published": "2017-01-31T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:51:01.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
