Shannon: The Steelers don't fully trust Le'Veon Bell \n\" It shows they fully trust Antonio Brown, and they do not fully trust Le’Veon Bell . If you look at it like this, Antonio Brown has 481 catches over the last four years - more than any other receiver during a four-year span in the about-to-be 98 year history of the National Football League. The best ability an individual could have playing professional sports is availability. It’s more important than jumping high, running fast, and being strong. And the one thing the Steelers know is that Antonio Brown will show up for them every single Sunday. Now, they missed Martavis Bryant all of last year, they missed part of him the year before. Sammie Coates has been inconsistent, he’s also missed time. Eli Rogers has missed time. Markus Wheaton, the other receiver, missed 12, 13, 14 games last year.\" Geoff Burke Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports Shannon: Le'Veon Bell's drug issues kept him from getting a long-term deal \n\"Also, Le’Veon Bell has missed time with injuries, but that’s really not why they didn’t do this deal . The last two years, he’s missed five games because of why, Skip? Drug suspensions . One time he tells you ‘got caught with the marijuana, blasé, blasé.' So now he was in the program, he said he missed his phone call, he moved houses. Even if you move to the moon, have your mail forwarded to the moon. Give them no excuse, no reason, because you know what the protocols are. You know once you’re in the program you must be on-call 24 hours a day. You understand that. So this is why they made this move. I don’t have a problem - and a lot of people are going to say ‘why would they pay a receiver that kind of money when Julian Edelman, Danny Amendola and all these guys [won a Super Bowl].’ I’m into paying the player, not the position. [Antonio Brown has] earned this raise. He’s earned the right to be the highest-paid receiver.\" Jay Biggerstaff Jay Biggerstaff-USA TODAY Sports Shannon: Le’Veon Bell has to earn the Steelers’ trust \"He’s earned this, Skip. He came on our show and he said ‘look, guys, I made some missteps. I apologized to my teammates.’ And even later in the week when he went back to Pittsburgh, he said ‘there’s some growing up I need to do. My team needs to be able to put their utmost trust and faith in me that I’m always going to do the right thing, always going to say the right thing.’ I believe him. Le’Veon Bell is going to have to show [that]. I still believe Le’Veon is the most complete back in all of football. But he’s going to have to show the Steelers that they can count on him , that they can trust him to always do the right thing, and [that] he’s going to be available. Not just on the football field running and catching the football, but being there and not being absent because of the suspensions.\" Geoff Burke Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports Skip: I’m disappointed that the Steelers committed to Antonio Brown “I am not surprised Pittsburgh did this, but I was disappointed in the Steelers for committing long-term to Antonio Brown. I believe - and this is easy for me to say because I’m not sitting in that GM’s hot seat, or any of the front office hot seats, or the ownership hot seats - but I believe I would have closed my eyes and plunged and not signed him long-term. I’m not going to condemn you for this, but I want to point out … let’s go back to that flashpoint moment after that playoff win in Kansas City in which Antonio made his first big blunder, although we’ve talked about other blunders where he got penalties for celebrations three times this year. He went live on Facebook and just shamed his coach in the background, kind of looking over his head, making fun of him. It was just such an egregious act. It’s breaking an unwritten rule you just can’t break, violating the sanctity of the locker room . I was shocked by it. We did it the next day on the show and you came down even harder on him. You said ‘he has revealed himself to be just another diva receiver.’” Jeff Curry Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports Shannon: Betting on Antonio Brown was the safer option for Pittsburgh \n\"If they had tried to shop Antonio Brown, I would have been OK with that too. But they chose to ride with him because guess what? Martavis Bryant, I don’t trust him. Eli Rogers is coming off a serious injury. Sammie Coates has been inconsistent. Le’Veon Bell … that’s why they didn’t give Le’Veon the long-term contract. I believe a long-term contract with a wide receiver is more [cost-effective] and beneficial than a running back because of the short shelf life of the running back. But I have no problem with either side.\" Jay Biggerstaff Jay Biggerstaff-USA TODAY Sports Skip: Antonio Brown damaged Mike Tomlin's credibility \"I’m not on board with the long-term, and I get it, I hear from everybody ‘Antonio does nothing but work hard when it’s time to work hard,’ that ‘he works as hard as any Pittsburgh Steeler.’ He does commit to the process of getting the best he can get. And he does return punts, that enhances his value a little bit there. And he is incredibly durable. In his eighth year, I can argue he’s a [safer bet] on pure health than Le’Veon, because Le’Veon - even though he does his tip-toe up to the line of scrimmage - when he decides to go across the line of scrimmage, it is high collision. He’s going to get banged up. He’s had two knee surgeries, and now he’s fighting a groin issue that could require surgery before it goes away. They made the right choice of going one way or the other, but I thought that Antonio … he damaged the credibility of his head coach , and I love this head coach. I’ve told you before, if I could pick a coach to play for, it definitely wouldn’t be Bill Belichick, it would be Mike Tomlin. And I thought [what Brown did] was so disrespectful to Mike Tomlin that it threatened the unity of that football team. That he became an island player.\" Geoff Burke Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports Skip: The locker room would unquestionably belong to Mike Tomlin if Brown wasn't there \n\"I thought Mike Tomlin could win back the football team by pulling off what I would call a ‘Jimmy Johnson special.’ \nBecause Jimmy was capable, in these kind of circumstances, of shocking the world by saying ‘you know what? I cut bait with him. We’re going forward, and we’re going to make it work with Martavis and all the others.’\" Geoff Burke Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:19:55.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
