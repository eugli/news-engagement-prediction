By David Moye \nIt looks at least one army command post is going to war, but with Nickelback, not Iran or Russia. \nA bizarre memo issued February 14 at an army command post in Washington State has declared that Nickelback’s music can no longer be played at all times. \nBesides the ‘back, the memo bans Korn, Slipknot, Smash Mouth and Creed. \nThe memo first came to light via the U.S. Army W.T.F! Moments Facebook page where it appeared in heavily redacted form, as seen below: \nThe memo has rocked the world of many military music fans, many of whom aren’t happy with their bands being mentioned on the list. \nOne commenter said putting Slipknot on the same list as Nickelback “is blasphemy, and not the cool kind of blasphemy that the band would appreciate.” \nOthers took issue with the memo itself, saying it didn’t match up with Army regulations, even using incorrect indentation for memos. \nU.S Army W.T.F! Moments spokesman Mike Trysom said the memo is real, but the sentiment may be tongue-in-cheek. \n[The term] ‘Real’ depends on your outlook,” Trysom told The Huffington Post. “Do we really think this commander signed that memo as a lawful order? No, not at all. It was likely a joke or a prank he played on one of the platoons under his command. The memo is valid and in the right format... some of our commenters are not as smart as they think they are.” \nJoke or not, Trysom said the commander’s sentiments struck a chord with him and the page’s other editors. \n“We think it was pretty funny, and ... we approve of his prohibitions, especially. Nickleback!” he said. \nThe memo can’t be good news for Nickelback, which, once again, is having their music dragged in the mud. \nThe Kensington Police Service on Prince Edward Island later apologized after a band spokesman complained. \nIn December, Mark Zuckerberg referenced the band in a YouTube skit involving his new AI assistant, named “Jarvis.” \nIn order to demonstrate the device’s abilities, Zuckerberg asked Jarvis to play “some good Nickelback songs.” \n“I’m afraid I can’t do that,” Jarvis responded. “There are no good Nickelback songs.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST 9 Trends From The '90s We Actually Want To Come Back 9 Trends From The '90s We Actually Want To Come Back 1 9 Colorful, Oversized Watches Remember when all of the cool girls had these?
