First funeral service \nThe first service will honour the memories of three out of the six victims. \nIt will take place at Montreal’s Maurice Richard Arena on Thursday at 12 p.m. ET, Mayor Denis Coderre tweeted. La cérémonie funéraire pour 3 des 6 victimes de l'attentat de Québec aura lieu demain après-midi à l'arena Maurice Richard. Détails suivront \nThe three victims who will be remembered at this service are as follows: Hassane Abdelkrim, 41, an IT worker for Quebec’s provincial government Khaled Belkacemi, 60, a professor of soil and agri-food engineering at l’Université Laval Aboubaker Thabti, 44, a pharmacy worker \nPrayers will also be said for the other three victims: Azzeddine Soufiane, 57, a grocer and owner of a halal butcher shop Mamadou Tanou Barry, 42, a technician at Lucas Meyer Cosmetics Ibrahima Barry, 39, an employee of Quebec’s health insurance board University of Laval professor saddened by loss of a colleague during Quebec City mosque shooting Second funeral service \nA second service is being planned at the Quebec City Convention Centre, to take place starting at 12:30 on Friday. \nThe service will begin with traditional Friday prayers, which will be followed by a “Salat al-Janazah,” or funeral prayer. \nMuslims believe that if such a prayer is not offered, then “the whole community will be considered sinful in the sight of Allah,” according to the book, What to Do When a Muslim Dies? \nOnce the prayer is offered, then the whole community will be saved from sin. \nREAD MORE: Public funeral for 3 Quebec City mosque shooting victims in Montreal on Thursday Burial \nBurials in Islam involve washing the body and placing it in a cloth before the funeral prayer is spoken. \nThe victims’ bodies will then be sent to be buried after prayer. \nFive of the victims’ bodies will be repatriated to other countries, though it’s not clear whose body will be sent where. \nThe bodies of the victims being remembered during Thursday’s service in Montreal will be sent to Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria. \nFor now, all six bodies have been returned to their families, said Mohamed Yangui, president of the Centre Culturel Islamique de Quebec. \nThere is no Muslim cemetery in Quebec City.
