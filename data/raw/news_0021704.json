The president is clearly not a fan of actor Alec Baldwin , who’s portrayed him to excellent effect on “ Saturday Night Live ” in recent months. Now, his younger brother Billy Baldwin has lightheartedly suggested that he could play the commander-in-chief’s second son, Eric Trump , on the comedy sketch show. “I’ve got the slicked back hair, I’m a little old for that, but yeah,” Baldwin joked on “Access Hollywood” Wednesday. “Because I’d just have to sit there and go... ‘duh.’” Billy Baldwin later admitted to “only kidding” about putting himself up for the role, before expressing hope that people would “come together” behind Trump.
