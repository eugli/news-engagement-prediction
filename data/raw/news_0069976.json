Four other private employees were also dismissed. None worked for state or other public agencies, Orrock said. \n“They were workers for a couple of our contractors and they violated the contractors' policy (of not posting photos taken on the job), and the contractors fired them,” Orrock said Tuesday. \n“It's just a safety issue,” he said. “If you're out there taking photos and posting video, you're not doing your job properly.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:56:33.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
