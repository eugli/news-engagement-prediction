Tears as blasphemy trial begins \nCrowds gathered for mass prayers around the city's Istiqlal Mosque on Saturday, urging people to cast their ballots for Muslim leaders. \nSupporters of several Islamic groups held posters with messages such as \"I'd prefer if my leader is a Muslim\" and \"It is forbidden to pick an infidel leader\". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hardliners insist that the city should be governed by a Muslim Image copyright EPA Image caption The event centred on the Istiqlal Mosque drew tens of thousands of people \nThe action follows big protests against Mr Purnama in December and a rally that turned violent in November, leaving one man dead and dozens of police and demonstrators injured. \nMr Purnama became Jakarta's first non-Muslim governor for 50 years and the first ethnic Chinese to hold the position when he took over from Joko Widodo - now the president - in 2014. \nHe won popularity for his no-nonsense style, as well as his stances against corruption and in favour of public transport and greater access to healthcare and education. \nBut some Islamists rejected him from the outset because of both his religion and ethnicity. \nHis position has been undermined by the court case against him, with prosecutors arguing that he insulted Islam by misusing a Koranic verse. \nMr Purnama had said that Islamic groups using a passage of the Koran to urge people not to support him were deceiving voters. \nThe verse is interpreted by some as prohibiting Muslims from living under the leadership of a non-Muslim. Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Purnama wept as his trial opened in December \nMr Purnama insisted his comments were aimed at politicians \"incorrectly\" using the verse against him, not at the verse itself. \nRights groups say the authorities have set a dangerous precedent in which a noisy hardline Islamic minority can influence the legal process. \nMr Purnama is facing two prominent Muslim challengers for the Jakarta governorship. \nIf none of the contenders gets more than 50%, a run-off election between the two top candidates will take place in April. \nChristians represent less than 10% of the country's 250 million people, and ethnic Chinese about 1%. \nIn 1998, a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment led to mobs looting and burning Chinese-owned shops and houses, leaving more than 1,000 people dead. \nHowever, Muslims in Indonesia are largely moderate and the country's largest Islamic organisation, Nahdlatul Ulama, had advised its members not to take part in the recent anti-Ahok protests.
