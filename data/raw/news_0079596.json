The Foxes scored their first league goals of 2017 in a devastating rout of the Reds, after which Klopp sent his playing staff a statement aimed to ensure they make swift improvements, per the Liverpool Echo 's Neil Jones : \nThe thing is, we are all playing for our future – myself included. We get judged every day, especially on matchdays, especially on performances. \nI don't think (the players) are not as good as I think they are, but they need my help to show it every week. \nI have said it a few times. When we lose, I feel maximum responsibility. I hope that by using always the word 'we' and not 'they' I show that I am involved in this. Jamie Vardy scored either side of Danny Drinkwater's sensational finish from outside the box to finish off Klopp's men, who scored a consolation through Philippe Coutinho. English football's hectic schedule has previously been a talking point for Klopp as he acclimated to a new calendar, but with 16 days off prior to Monday's fixture, the German offered the notion of another obstacle this time around: \nLast year we had a game every three days or something, and we were asked to use this as an excuse. I think it makes more sense to use that as an excuse, because you have injuries and other things. \nYes, 15 or 16 days to prepare is not perfect, because of the rhythm. But for defending you don't need rhythm, you need organisation. Speaking to Sky Sports after Monday's result, Klopp gave further judgement on his side's below-par performance, where he again suggested he will demand more of his team: Bleacher Report UK @br_uk 2/27/2017, 10:48:51 PM Those comments followed the latest leg of Liverpool's plummet in form over recent months, falling from Premier League title contenders to fifth in the standings and just a point ahead of sixth-placed Manchester United . What's more, the club's worrying dip also included an FA Cup fourth-round exit at the hands of Wolverhampton Wanderers , and broadcaster Richard Keys criticised the Liverpool manager's approach to the competition: Richard Keys @richardajkeys I wonder if Klopp is regretting not going after the FA Cup? I couldn't believe he took it so lightly with his league season dead. 2/27/2017, 9:41:30 PM Having lost just two games between the start of the season and January 11, 2017—a total of 150 days—Liverpool's record has since spiralled downwards, with the club winning only two of their 12 fixtures across all contests in 2017. A portion of the blame lands at the players' feet, as suggested by Klopp, although BT Sport presenter Jake Humphrey has questioned the manager's approach to preparing his squad as well: Jake Humphrey @mrjakehumphrey 2/27/2017, 8:52:46 PM It's been almost 18 months since Klopp first arrived at the Anfield helm as a replacement for Brendan Rodgers, but many will question whether the club have truly made strides in their development under the German. The Merseysiders showed plenty of promise in Klopp's first season in charge and made it to the finals of the League Cup and the UEFA Europa League before falling to Manchester City and Sevilla , respectively. Meanwhile, rivals United won the EFL Cup on Sunday, Manchester City are clinging on to a future in the UEFA Champions League and Tottenham Hotspur are still in with a hope of challenging Premier League leaders Chelsea for the crown. Liverpool's peers are making improvements, but Klopp has suggested more is required of both him and his stars if they're to preserve their futures at Anfield. Like the new article format? !
