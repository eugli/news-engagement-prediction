Besides working at the restaurant, Mr. Pellegrino wrote four Rao’s cookbooks and acted in “Goodfellas” and “The Sopranos.” Credit Keith Meyers/The New York Times Frank Pellegrino Sr., a sometime actor and the unflappable gatekeeper of Rao’s , his family’s clannish, celebrity-studded and prohibitively exclusive restaurant in East Harlem , died on Tuesday in Manhattan. He was 72. The cause was lung cancer, his son, Frank Jr., said. Mr. Pellegrino was a struggling singer playing nightclubs and cruise ships in 1972 when his aunt, whose husband’s father had founded Rao’s, on East 114th Street, in 1896, enlisted him to help out because business was booming. “I came for two weeks and stayed 44 years,” he told Vanity Fair last year. Mr. Pellegrino became a co-owner and the man to call for a reservation for one of the restaurant’s coveted four tables and six booths — an exercise in crushed hopes for most would-be patrons; Rao’s says it is booked for the rest of 2017. Mr. Pellegrino came to be called Frankie No for his firm, egalitarian protocol of turning away the disappointed, regardless of rank. “I don’t need no money, fortune or fame,” he was said to have crooned as he rebuffed the investor Warren E. Buffett one night. “I’ve got all the riches, baby, one man can claim.” \n  On another occasion, he listened patiently as a caller pleaded over the phone, saying that he was a childhood pal of the beloved parish priest who had recently presided over the annual Giglio di Sant’Antonio festival nearby on Pleasant Avenue. After hearing him out, Mr. Pellegrino replied, “Good, but not good enough,” and hung up. When the gourmand Jason Epstein ran Random House, he insisted on publishing the first of Mr. Pellegrino’s four Rao’s cookbooks. The gesture gained Mr. Epstein access to Rao’s recipes but not to a regular table. In 1977, Mimi Sheraton, then the restaurant critic for The New York Times, awarded Rao’s (pronounced RAY-ohs) three stars for its “wonderfully simple, honest and completely delicious Italian food.” The review sealed the reputation of Rao’s as New York’s most exclusive restaurant (and, according to the writer Norman Mailer, Ms. Sheraton’s reputation as “the woman who ruined Rao’s”). Among the regulars have been the director Martin Scorsese, who cast Mr. Pellegrino as Johnny Dio, the cigar-smoking prison chef, in the 1990 gangster film “Goodfellas.” Mr. Scorsese later filmed a scene from his movie “The Wolf of Wall Street” at the restaurant. Mr. Pellegrino also played an F.B.I. chief, Frank Cubitoso, in the HBO series “The Sopranos.” At Rao’s, regulars own their tables like a time share, reserving a table one night a week, for example, or on Christmas. A regular can also lend a slot to family or friends, which meant that getting past Mr. Pellegrino was all about connections.
