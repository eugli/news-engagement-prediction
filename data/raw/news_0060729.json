SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Laticia Gibson was going through a quarter-life crisis brought on by years of trauma stemming from child sexual abuse. Photo: Andrew Meares \nBut bubbling beneath the surface were years of undiagnosed trauma, stemming from the fact that she was sexually abused by a family member around the age of four. \n\"I was not coping well,\" she said. \"I had really bad anxiety, insomnia, I contemplated suicide a number of times, several relationships broke down. I was going through a quarter-life crisis because I just hadn't addressed a lot of issues.\" SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Laticia Gibson was fast rising the ranks as a reporter with Today Tonight but hadn't dealt with her history of abuse. Photo: Chennel Seven \nThe sudden deaths of two friends – journalist Morgan Mellish in the Garuda plane disaster, and an ex-boyfriend – prompted her to buy a one-way ticket to London on a whim. \nBut it was only on her return recently that she finally confronted her past.

She will host the National Family Violence Summit in Canberra on Monday, run by the Tara Costigan Foundation and BaptistCare.

SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link After confronting her past, Ms Gibson now lies in Canberra with supportive partner Andrew and their dog Max. Photo: Andrew Meares \nLast year, the federal committed $20 million to early intervention such as programs for new fathers and resources for girls to help them identify the early signs of violence. \nThe NSW government released a four-year early intervention strategy last year including $20 million to fund innovative ideas. \nYet frontline workers say change is slow and childrens' education is still grossly neglected. \n\"We talk about how resilient children are but if you don't intervene at the right time, they will grow up to be victims and perpetrators,\" said Lesley Robson, a BaptistCare domestic violence housing manager who runs a program for children at their western Sydney shelter. \nThe program, funded entirely by donations, helps children process their experience, understand domestic violence and learn about healthy relationships. \n\"We have a lot of crisis services but all we're doing is picking up the pieces,\" she said. \n\"Once children are listened to and if they know people care and that there is a safer way to live then they do recover.\" \nMs Gibson, now living in Canberra, went on to endure physically abusive relationships as an adult and said it was only through intense counselling that she could see how the childhood abuse played out in her life. \n\"I remember as a child being so scared, having really horrible dreams [and] being afraid of establishing close connections with people. The examples I had around me weren't healthy relationships.\" \n\"I got into quite a number of relationships where the pattern repeated and I'd justify the behaviour because I had no sense of self worth.\" \nMs Gibson tried to bring up the abuse several times in the past but her family never believed her. \nAnd, in a blow almost as devastating as the abuse itself, her family effectively abandoned her. She confronted them a year ago to insist they accept what had happened. She is now estranged from her mother. \n\"It took me months and months to recover from the emotional and psychological trail that it left. It literally brought me to my knees,\" she said. \"The last thing I expected was to be turned on the way I was.\" \nNow in a supportive relationship with partner Andrew and running her own media production company, Ms Gibson said she wishes teachers, friends and counsellors who had noticed a sudden change in her as a child \"said something rather than sweeping it under the carpet\". \nBaptistCare and the Tara Costigan Foundation came together when former BaptistCare employee and Mr Costigan's niece, Tara, was murdered by her ex-partner while she was holding her baby in her Canberra home last year. \nHe was sentenced to 32 years' jail on Friday.
