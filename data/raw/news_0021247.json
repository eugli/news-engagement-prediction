More than 90 of the FA Council's 122 members are men aged 60 or over The \"old men\" accused of blocking change at the Football Association are \"stupid enough\" to fight reforms, says former FA chairman Greg Dyke. \nMPs will debate the FA's failure to reform in Parliament on Thursday. \nSports Minister Tracey Crouch has warned the FA could lose £30m-£40m of funding if it does not modernise. \n\"You shouldn't underestimate the old men of English football. They've seen off all sorts of people over the years,\" Dyke told BBC Radio 5 live. \n\"Government are now saying if you don't do these things you'll lose money and we won't support you in the future. Who knows, they are stupid enough to say 'we're going to fight it anyway',\" he added. \nThe FA is effectively run by its own parliament, the FA Council, which has 122 members - just eight are women and only four from ethnic minorities. More than 90 of the 122 members are aged over 60. \nThe government has repeatedly called for the FA to be more representative of modern society, and those who play the game. It also wants the organisation to change the way it makes decisions. \nLast year, five former FA executives - including Dyke - called on the government to pass legislation to force through FA reform, saying they had been blocked in their attempts to do so. \n\"There needs to be radical change,\" Dyke continued. \"You've got to have younger people there, more women, supporters, ethnic minorities - it's got to change. \n\"The Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee has produced two papers over the years that have both pressed for change and both been completely ignored by this bunch of old guys.\" \nHe singled out 25 life-presidents on the FA Council he said were \"not representing anyone\", adding: \"It's an ongoing oligarchy that looks after itself. \n\"My understanding is that the professional game has also had enough of these old guys.\" \nCurrent chairman Greg Clarke has said he will quit if his latest plans for reform are not accepted when he presents them to the government in the spring. \nAnd Dyke said: \"I think Greg Clarke is a good guy who is trying to make a change, as I did. \n\"I suspect what Greg is doing is saying is to the FA, more than government, that if you can't give me a deal that meets what government is after then I'm not staying around. In which case they'll have lost another chairman. I'm not sure that will worry them - they've lost so many chairmen over the years it doesn't really matter.\" Analysis \nBBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway \nLast year Sport England set out required standards for transparency, accountability and financial integrity from those bodies that ask for government and National Lottery funding. The code will come into force in April. \nIt demands, for example, 30% diversity on boards, greater transparency and term limits. \nThe FA is due to meet the government in the spring to show its plans for achieving the required standards. \nBut MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee have run out of patience and are exerting pressure on the FA to ensure it goes through with modernisation. Thursday's backbench debate is another method to do just that.
