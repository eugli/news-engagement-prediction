Photo: Elizabeth Conley, Houston Chronicle Image 30 of 30 Donnie Wahlberg throws shade on Bayou City at Hughes Manor 1 / 30 \nDid Donnie Wahlberg just insult Houston? \nIt certainly seemed that way to Leather & Laces party-goers at Hughes Manor on Friday night. \nThe singer-songwriter, record producer, and New Kids on the Block founding member co-hosted the 14th annual bash alongside his wife, Jenny McCarthy . \n\"You don't get a second shot at the Super Bowl,\" he told the packed dance floor via microphone just before midnight. \"They said that Houston couldn't handle the Super Bowl, but Houston, you've got a second shot at the Super Bowl.\" \nThat's when things got weird. \nFaint boos were heard throughout the slightly stunned crowd. \nThe 47-year old who has appeared in \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"Band of Brothers\" added insult to injury by insinuating that the Houston Texans were not of Super Bowl caliber. \n\"If you don't have a team in the game - man, I don't even know what that feels like - it's time to get your team in game,\" Wahlberg said. \nMcCarthy, who has co-hosted the party for ten years, looked radiant by his side in a red gown and waist-length extensions. The couple canoodled with friends in a bottle service lounge section next to the main DJ booth for most of the evening. \nTo Wahlberg's credit, he did declare an unofficial holiday weekend. \n\"Don't eat, just drink,\" he said. \"Let's party like there's no tomorrow.\" \nParty-goers could get behind him on that sentiment, at least.
