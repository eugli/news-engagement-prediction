The two businessmen, who were overly powerful during the reign of John Mahama, were summoned over the probe surrounding the ousted CEO of the Cocobod, Dr. Stephen Kwabena Opuni. EOCO’s initial investigations are suspected to have fingered the duo in the massive deals at the body managing cocoa transactions in Ghana leading to their invitation. This does not suggest that they have been found guilty but their presence suggests they have got some questions to answer before final claims can be made against them. The ongoing investigation of the sacked CEO borders on a wide range of issues, including alleged massive corruption in the cocoa sector. Mr.Ibrahim and Ali Seidu are believed to have been huge beneficiaries of contracts that were reportedly awarded without laid down regulations and fertilizers purportedly smuggled to neigbouring countries for individuals’ interest during Dr. Opuni’s tenure. Specifically, government intends to probe some supposed fraudulent multi-million dollar contracts he’s believed to have signed before leaving office, the sources indicated. It is also unclear for now; whether EOCO may have carried out this action based on a court order. Mr. Opuni’s tenure was engrossed in several allegations of corruption and mismanagement of the cocoa sector, with his critics accusing him of running down the critical sector; which generates revenue for the country and employs millions of Ghanaians.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:21:33.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
