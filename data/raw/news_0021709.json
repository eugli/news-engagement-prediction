Clinton Speedy-Duroux Source: Supplied Evelyn Greenup   man facing court this morning had previously been charged with their murders but was later acquitted after a judge ruled the trials should be heard separately. \nThis meant evidence about potential similarities and the man’s links to each of the deaths could not be heard before the same court. Colleen Walker was 16 when she went missing in September 1990. No one has ever been charged over her murder.   appearance of the man today is a major step in the fight for justice for the family of the children. \nRelatives believe the children’s suspected murders were not properly investigated at the time because of racism and were devastated when told their children had simply gone “walkabout”. \nThe white man they always suspected of killing their children also lived in the small Bowraville community. \nLast year NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione apologised to the families of the victims and acknowledged the initial police investigation was inadequate. Outgoing NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione lay wreaths in Bowraville with the families of the three murdered children.   \nA major stumbling block to a retrial has been the double jeopardy laws which prevent a person from being tried more than once for the same crime. \nBut in 2006 the state’s double jeopardy laws were changed to allow a person to be tried for the same crime but only if there was “fresh and compelling evidence”. \nIt remains unknown whether evidence that police believe links the killings to each other and the suspect meets the legal definition of “fresh” and is evidence that has not already been “adduced” in court.
