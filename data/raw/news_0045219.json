According to a report from KTUL , the employees were fired via text messages from the owner of the restaurant which read, “You and your family are fired… I hope you enjoyed your day off, and you can enjoy many more. Love you.” What this text means for former employees at a restaurant in #Catoosa coming up at 6 on @KTULNews pic.twitter.com/WaMLt9znAA \n— Ethan Hutchins (@ehutchinsnews) February 17, 2017 \nRestaurant owner Bill McNally said that it’s really much simpler than that, and his decision to terminate the employees was more about the company’s no-show policy. In a statement to KTUL he said that his restaurant has a “Zero tolerance policy for no show/no call incidents and the 12 employees violated that policy.” \nNow, Facebook and Yelp users are expressing their discontent with the restaurant on social media. I Don’t Care Bar and Grill’s Yelp page is now full of one star reviews. And many of them are not about the food:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:52:27.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
