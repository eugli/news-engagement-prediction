SABCâ€™s appeal to keep Motsoeneng at work dismissed \nUnited Democratic Movement chief whip Nqabayomzi Kwankwa said in January that Motsoeneng should be invited to testify before the committee. \nIn February the High Court in Cape Town dismissed the SABC's application for leave to appeal its order that Motsoeneng be barred from occupying any position at the public broadcaster. \nThe court ruled late last year that Motsoeneng's appointment as group executive for corporate affairs - the post he held prior to becoming COO - had been \"irrational and unlawful\". \nIt said Motsoeneng could not occupy any position at the SABC unless a 2014 report by the public protector was set aside by a court, or new disciplinary processes against him were finalised. \nThe High Court said the initial disciplinary hearing that cleared Motsoeneng of wrongdoing was \"wholly inadequate\".
