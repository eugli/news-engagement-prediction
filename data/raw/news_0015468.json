Sreesanth, the former fast bowler of Indian cricket team entered into a Twitter battle with the former openor Aakash Chopra because the later openly objected to Sreesanth's come back in Indian cricket.\nThe ugly war-of-words on social media between the two ex-players started only when a cricket fan asked Aakash Chopra if Sreesanth should be given a chance to come back to the Indian team or not, and the former player replied with a 'no'. This is because commentator Chopra feels that someone who is once booked in fir match fixing should not be allowed to represent the team again.\nHere are the series of tweets between the two players: \n@cricketaakash sir..ur opinion om sreesanth?..can he make a come back?..\n— jeswin immanuel (@im_jeswin) January 31, 2017  \nNO https://t.co/T5Zn3Z9iXo \n— Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash) January 31, 2017  \nI'm a bit of a hardliner when it comes to match-spot fixing...for expunging records and setting precedents. But that's my opinion. ðÂÂÂÂÂÂ https://t.co/X8OXh4KNSr \n— Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash) January 31, 2017 Following the conversation and the blame-game, Sreesanth took to Twitter and hit Aakash Chopra with a series of angry tweets:\n@cricketaakash how can u be so 2 faced??

Sreesanth was accused of spot fixing in IPL 2013, though got a clean-chit later from a Delhi court. On the other hand, former cricketer Aakash Chopra now plays the role of a commentator. \n\nSreesanth openly taunted the Aakash Chopra and said that he his waiting for his comeback match where Chopra will do the commentary.\n@cricketaakash yes,looking forward to hear ur commentary when I play..which will be very soon\n— Sreesanth (@sreesanth36) February 3, 2017 The online war-of-words between Sreesanth and Aakash Chopra went quite far with a single 'no' from the later's end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:58:40.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
