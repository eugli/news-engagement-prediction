David Duke (yes, THAT David Duke) all but endorses Keith Ellison for DNC Chair Posted at 9:42 am on February 13, 2017 by Sam J.   \nOh man, the DNC is SUCH a mess. \nWhat with Debbie Wasserman Schultz getting the boot for “assisting” Hillary with the nomination to Donna Brazile (who also “assisted” Hillary and got the boot from CNN), it would seem they have a real problem. \nLuckily (for Democrats) the DNC is working on electing a new DNC chair … Running for DNC Chair. pic.twitter.com/bU8SlJeEkh \n— Fox News (@FoxNews) February 12, 2017 \nPlenty of candidates running, including Keith Ellison, who was incidentally the first Muslim to be elected to the U.S. Congress. Trending Kellyanne Conway has the BEST answer in defense of Melania Trump \nSeems Keith has a “fan”: Keith Ellison, Sally Boynton Brown or Jehmu Greene would all be excellent choices – I really like Keith though… I mean, at least he knows. https://t.co/jXQK1CJEie \n— David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) February 12, 2017 \nUmmm. \nDavid Duke says he “really likes” Keith Ellison. \nNot just likes him … REALLY likes him. \nThat’s sort of an endorsement, right? I expect these endorsements to be covered extensively by the media. https://t.co/kKs5VoCvVd \n— Amanda Prestigiacomo (@AmandaPresto) February 13, 2017 \nWhen will Ellison disavow this? Remember how mad the Democrats got when Duke praised Trump? \nHa!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T17:17:10.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
