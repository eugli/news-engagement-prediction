His appearance at the UN came just before the organization's chief monitor told CNN that there were about 200 ceasefire violations overnight Tuesday local time. The number is added to hundreds more observed since the ceasefire nominally began Monday morning. Alexander Hug, head of the OSCE's Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine told CNN's Clare Sebastian that around 100 of those were explosions, indicating that heavy weaponry like tanks and mortars are still in place. Unlike the last few weeks, where critical infrastructure was cut off, there is no immediate crisis as of now, but any of these explosions could knock out a power line and make things worse, Hug added.

Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that Russia is recognizing the travel documents \"for humanitarian reasons.\" JUST WATCHED ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:27:43.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
