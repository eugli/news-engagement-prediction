Seventh time lucky? Steve Smith put his first foot on the India tour right after calling it right at the coin toss. He won the toss and expectedly opted to bat first. However, history is against Australia when it comes to match results and winning tosses. Australia have won toss in their last six Tests in India but ended up on the losing side. Thursday made it seven but will Pune result in change of fortunes? We will know soon. Call a dermatologist! Such was the appearance of the Pune track that it was hard to differentiate it from a fifth day pitch. There were cracks, and after just 10 overs, it was peppered with rough areas for the spinners to exploit. Australia legend Shane Warne called it as a day-eight wicket, even before a ball had been bowled and Ravi Shastri joked the pitch will seriously need a dermatologist after Test has ended. Renshaw retires sick At the fall of first Australia wicket as Steve Smith approached the middle, he was in for a surprise. David Warner had just exited for the dressing room and Smith was inside the field when he saw Matt Renshaw hurrying towards him. Smith, clearly puzzled, enquired and following a brief chit chat, Renshaw was off. It turned out, the 20-year-old was retiring hurt on account of an upset stomach. He was on 36 when he left the field and returned after the dismissal over Shaun Marsh to score a fighting half-century. ..and leaves Allan Border angry While others may sympathies with Renshaw for the stomach illness that forced him to retire midway what was shaping up to be an impressive knock, Allan Border was clearly at the opposite end of the spectrum. \"I hope he is lying on the table in there, half-dead. Otherwise, as captain, I would not be happy,\" he said on Fox Sports during the lunch break. \"I can tell you what, if Shaun Marsh was dismissed in those last 15 minutes, I would've been ropeable as captain,\" he said. The long pause It was the sixth delivery of the 23rd over. On strike was Renshaw and Ashwin was quickly going through his overs. However, he had a change of heart and opted to change his side. Warner, who was   responded by calling Renshwa for a little chat thereby further delaying the proceedings. By the time he returned to his crease, Virat Kohli had called Ashwin for a chat. The crowd knew what was happening and gave a roaring approval for the mid games being played between the two teams. Shane Warne, who was commentating at the time, termed it the longest pause ever. The wasted reviews India wasted their two reviews within inside 40 overs. The first one came in the 10th over when they contested a caught behind appeal which was turned down by the on-field umpire. After much contemplation when they did go for the DRS, replays clearly revealed there was daylight between bat and ball. The next came in the 39th over when they reviewed a not out lbw call against Steve Smith. The ball was heading down leg, missing the stump but on Saha's insistence, Kohli made the call. The on-field decision was upheld and India lost both their reviews. The screamer The catch that Wriddhiman Saha took to get rid of Steve O'Keefe is something the wicketkeeper will remember for a long time to come. As Keefe went to cut a short delivery from Umesh, the ball took an edge and zipped to the vacant slip area but for Saha who leaped, parallel to the ground and pulled off a one-handed stunner. Even Kohli, a top fielder himself, was left impressed with the outstanding effort.
