Transformed into an underground mosh pit (standing room only), the peak youth culture moment culminated when an ineffably cool girl with a peroxide pixie strode powerfully down the runway in a metal mini—Korean model EZ ’s New York Fashion Week breakout. It was only a year and a half ago that the 20-year-old made her debut at Seoul Fashion Week, after a chance run-in with Pushbutton designer Seung Gun Park at a party in Cheongdam. “He came up to me and asked, ‘Are you a girl or a boy?’” she says, laughing backstage, wrapped in one of the brand’s teddy-bear faux furs. He immediately cast her in a shoot, then asked her to close his Spring 2016 show a few weeks later—and to buzz and bleach her head orange for the occasion. She agreed, and became an overnight runway and street-style sensation. “It got me attention, it got me work, it got me shot in magazines,” she says, shaking her hand through it. “Now it feels like my hair—like a signature.” Which leads back to Wang. Booked as an exclusive mere days after moving to Queens from Seoul (where she was born and raised) with friend and fellow model Sohyun Jung (who also snagged a coveted Wang exclusive for the runway this season), EZ says it still feels rather surreal. “For my first show to be Alexander Wang, I would have been so thankful to wear anything,” she says. “To have the closing look on top of that…. Really, my luck has been so good.” Chalk it up to her undeniable It factor—and the power of an unforgettable cut.
