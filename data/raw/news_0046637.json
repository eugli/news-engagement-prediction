Sweden, who would believe this?” \n“No one would believe that,” responded Colbert, who pointed out that no terrorist attack occurred in Sweden on Friday night. “Well, not no one, but maybe someone who skips their intelligence briefings.” \nThe president’s blunder was ridiculed, including by former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, who tweeted, “Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking?” \n“What has he been smoking?” Colbert asked. “Uh, Vladimir Putin’s d—?” The quip was met with applause, and the host blew a kiss directly at the camera. \nTrump later clarified that he was referring to a debunked report on Fox News about alleged violence perpetrated by refugees in Sweden. His comments prompted Colbert to speculate on what other things that Trump has learned from TV. \n“Clearly, Trump believes everything he sees on TV is real, which would explain his next tweet, ‘America is a disaster! Our girls are broke! Our dead are walking! The pope’s too young! It’s a scandal! #shameless,'” Colbert joked. “All true. He’s right, we’ve got to do something about all that.” \nThe Late Show airs on CBS at 11:35 p.m. ET.
