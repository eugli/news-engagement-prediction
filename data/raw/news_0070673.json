The caller ID showed that Melanie, the sister of his former life partner, George Michael, was trying to reach him. He figured it could wait. And then he heard from Michael's manager. \nMichael had died on Christmas Day. He was only 53. \n\"I was in a zone,\" Goss says, admitting he was in a state of shock that seized the moment and hasn't fully let go. It's taken a while to process the relationship that lasted from 1996 until 2011. Sitting in the offices of the Goss-Michael Foundation in the Dallas Design District, with a painting of Angus Fairhurst's Fata Morgana looming behind him, Goss admits he still listens to \"A Different Corner,\" a song Michael wrote and released in 1986. Goss calls it his all-time favorite. \n\"I would not be sitting here with this wonderful life,\" he says, not without emotion, \"if I had turned a different corner.\" An undated photograph of pop superstar George Michael and Dallas partner Kenny Goss from Kenny Goss' personal collection. Kenny Goss' private collection \nHe and Michael never married (though they did exchange rings), but the international press, the tabloid industry in particular, has seized on the fact that Goss was committed to one of Britain's most famous pop stars longer than anyone else. \nGoss keeps an apartment in Los Angeles but prefers his hometown of Dallas, where he and Michael owned a mansion in Highland Park, and where he now stays in a downtown luxury hotel with his beloved Texas Lacy dog, \"Dixie Goss.\" He and Dixie can free themselves far more easily here, he says, from the white-hot pursuit of the paparazzi. \nClose to 300 media outlets have tried to interview him since Michael's death. He agreed Thursday to share his remembrances of Michael exclusively with The Dallas Morning News and its media partner, KXAS-TV (NBC5). \nIn an interview that lingered for more than an hour, he spoke candidly and at times emotionally about Michael. \nHe declined to comment about hairstylist Fadi Fawaz, who had been Michael's boyfriend for four years. Fawaz was with Michael the day his body was discovered. Goss says he has never even met Fawaz and knows nothing about him. \nGoss declined to discuss the circumstances surrounding Michael's death, such as why the body has yet to be buried. Authorities haven't issued an official cause of death yet. \n\"I know nothing about that,\" Goss says. \nHe preferred instead to reminisce about Michael, who had an eerie way of seeing things that turned out to be true. For instance, in one of their last conversations, which Goss says lingered for hours, Michael predicted that Donald Trump would be elected president. \n\"I told him, 'Are you [expletive] kidding me?' \" Goss says. \" 'There is no way that is going to happen,' to which George replied 'Darlin,' I'm sorry, but I really do believe it's going to happen.' \" (Until the day he died, Goss says, Michael always called him \"Darlin'\".) \nGoss brightened when the subject turned to the future of the Dallas art venue they shared, the Goss-Michael Foundation , which began as Goss Gallery on Cedar Springs in 2005 and has remained an edgy cornerstone of Dallas' contemporary art scene. \n\"At this point, I don't see anything changing,\" Goss says. \"I guess the question is: Do we have the money to continue? Absolutely. And so, it's not problematic at all. The foundation is not changing unless I decide I don't want to do it any more.\" British pop superstar George Michael (right) kisses his Dallas partner Kenny Goss in an undated photograph from Goss' private collection Kenny Goss' private collection \nSo, yes, the foundation will continue, Goss says, despite the absence of Michael's largesse. The foundation still enjoys a halo effect since Michael's death and Goss says contributions have actually increased. He enjoys the support of Dallas' most committed art connoisseurs and patrons, and on a social level, he remains in touch with friends he met through Michael. Elton John, for instance, has invited him to his lavish Oscar party on Sunday night in Los Angeles. But as Michael would have wanted it, \"giving\" remains a must. \nThe foundation's mission, Goss says, is that \"we get money back and that we help people. That was George's deal.\" Goss marvels at how the foundation has already helped young artists with its artist-in-residence program. He cited the growth of painter Neil Raitt in particular. \nHe takes enormous pride, he says, in the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, for which the Goss-Michael Foundation has raised $8 million over five years through its MTV Re:Define event, whose sixth edition takes place March 24 at Dallas Contemporary. The 2017 version of Dallas' MTV Re:Define showcases Chaka Khan in a tribute to George Michael \n\"We hope to raise another $3 million this year,\" Goss says, \"and that's in six years. That's a lot of money.\" \nMichael's influence continues to resonate with the project as a whole. He hosted the 1998 cinematic short, MTV Staying Alive , which focused on six young people living with or affected by HIV. Michael was the first artist to work with MTV on the project, which became the launching pad for the Staying Alive Foundation , MTV's international content-producing and grant-giving HIV prevention initiative. \nWarning: The video below contains mature subject matter.

Michael was the first artist to work with MTV on the project, which became the launching pad for today's Staying Alive Foundation, MTV's international content-producing and grant-giving HIV prevention initiative. \nWhen it comes to philanthropy, Michael, he says, was the trailblazer, selling him on the philosophy that giving back is mandatory. \"We always did that in England, and we wanted to bring that to Dallas, and his name helped so much when we were asking people to give. He never understood that. He just wrote huge checks, enormous ones. He gave away tens of millions of pounds to charity.\" \nHe felt embarrassed, Goss says, maybe even a bit ashamed, by the level of success and fame he enjoyed, hence his need to give so abundantly. \nEven so, money was always an off-limits subject to Michael. \"He just didn't want to waste time with that,\" Goss says, adding that Michael's generosity helped redefine and refocus his own life. \nThey differed on the size of the houses they owned, he recalls with a laugh, saying that Michael preferred small houses (Goss did not). To say that Michael was a homebody would be an understatement, Goss says. The singer preferred being home in England in one of his very small homes. He loved dogs, a passion he passed to his partner.

We just had a really good, sweet relationship.\" The break-up, he said, was \"just what it was. We weren't even mad at each other or anything like that.\" \nHe can't even say they grew apart, \"nor do I think George would say that.\" \nGoss spoke endearingly of Michael's father, Jack, a Greek Cypriot immigrant who became a successful restaurateur; his mother, Leslie, an Englishwoman \"with wonderful values, who George loved beyond belief,\" who passed away years ago; and his \"two wonderful sisters,\" Yioda and Melanie. \nGoss says he most misses Michael's self-deprecating humor, such as his comment about his 1998 arrest in a public bathroom, where he was publicly outed: \"The most horrific thing that happened was that I was photographed with my shirt off and I was fat. Can you imagine two worse things than being fat and gay?\" \nGoss says he appreciated the loving nature of Michael's family, which became a kind of surrogate family for him. Born in Brownwood, Goss calls his late father a hard-working man. The elder Goss sold fire protection equipment for buildings; his mother was a homemaker. When Goss was 5, the family moved to Irving, and when he was 12, they moved again, to Euless. \nHe graduated from Trinity High School, where he angered his demanding dad by making the varsity gymnastics team â not the football team. It was a sore point, he says, and part of a sad, recurring theme. No matter how hard he tried, he never seemed able to please his father. \nDespite the difficulties at home, Kenny says his parents were \"salt-of-the-Earth country people\" who, in many ways, were simply doing the best they could. \nHis brother Tim Goss, a Dallas attorney, told The News in 2005 that \"I shudder to think how I might have turned out had I not had one good parent, and for me, that parent was Kenny.\" \nGoss says the only Michael song he wants to listen to these days is \"American Angel.\" He recalled fondly a song Michael wrote for him, titled \"Where I Hope You Are.\" \"George Loves Kenny\" is a neon work by British contemporary artist Tracey Emin for Dallas art collector Kenny Goss and his partner, pop-star George Michael \nIn one stanza, Michael writes: \nThese days, in so many, so many ways My life gets bad for you But your face when you look at me, look at me that way Tears me in two \nGoss says that, when it comes to future relationships, no one can ever replace Michael, who even after they broke up told him, \"Darlin,' I want you to meet someone who will love and take care of you.\" \n\"He was,\" Goss says with a sigh, \"truly the love of my life. And I think I was the love of his life.\" See more with Kenny Goss: \nKenny Goss also spoke with The News ' television partner, NBC 5, about love, loss and his eternal connection to George Michael.
