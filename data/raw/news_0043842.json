Officials said there are four plates holding parts of her face together.\nVanderzee said she can’t recall the attack, being taken to hospital, or the names of the two boys accused in the attack.\nShe was working alone at the Elk Island Child and Youth Ranch northeast of Edmonton when the incident happened late that night. Now, two boys, aged 14 and 15-years-old, are facing charges of attempted murder, among others, for their alleged roles in the incident.\nFor now, Vanderzee is focusing on her recovery; she has been told that if she regains her memory she could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.\nVanderzee currently has no income, and her partner, Larry, is on a pension.  A friend has started a GoFundMe page to help them with their financial challenges in the aftermath of the attack.\nAs the couple faces the long road ahead of them, Larry believes the courts should treat the two accused like adults and had a few harsh words for them.\n“If they want to play in a big boy world, they should be taking big boy punishment.”\nWith files from David Ewasuk \nRelated Stories Two youths turn themselves in to police after assault at Youth Ranch Photos Fort Saskatchewan RCMP searching for two teens after an alleged assault at the Elk Island Youth Ranch.
