By the end of this year, we are on track to have our anti-money laundering and sanctions policy framework in place and to have introduced major compliance IT systems across the group”.\nThe bank said the element of Gulliver’s bonus - and that two other main directors - which was gauged on improving defences against fighting crime had been reduced. His pay fell to £5.6m from £7.3m but this was largely the result of a change in the overall pay policy at the bank. His annual bonus rose, however, because Gulliver met other performance measures.\nThe monitor - Michael Cherkasky - had expressed concerns a year ago as well and this year again highlighted concerns about the pace of progress and “instances of potential finance crime that the DoJ and HSBC are reviewing further and on-going systems and control deficiencies that in his view raised questions as to whether HSBC is adhering to all its obligations under the US DPA”.\nThe remuneration report published along the results also showed that the bank reduced pay of “certain individuals” by $12.1m to “reflect their involvement in certain notable events and individual transgressions”.\nThe bank, which employs around 240,000 around the world, said it “ is subject to an investigation by the FCA into compliance with UK monetary laundering investigations and financial crime systems and control requirements”. \nThe 62% fall in profits slumped $7.1bn was caused by a $3.2bn write down of its private banking operations, $3.1bn incurred by Gulliver’s overhaul of the bank and a number of other items including the sale of the Brazilian operations. Without these, profits were broadly flat $19.3bn.\nGulliver is planning to help bolster returns to shareholder by buying back $1bn of shares, on top of $2.5bn announced in August .\nThe bank is the process of overhauling its board and seeking a new chairman to replace Douglas Flint who said an announcement would be made “in due course”.\nHe said the bank would need to relocate staff from London to Paris in the next two years a result of Brexit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:52:13.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
