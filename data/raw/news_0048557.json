But okay. Maybe you’ll have another chance.” \nAsked whether a threat to seize Iraq’s oil was on the agenda for his Iraq visit, Mattis flatly ruled out any such intent. \n“I think all of us here in this room, all of us in America have generally paid for our gas and oil all along and I’m sure that we will continue to do so in the future,” Mattis told a small group of reporters traveling with him as he discussed his objectives for the trip. \n“We’re not in Iraq to seize anybody’s oil.” \nMattis remarks are only the latest example of his policy differences with Trump. Trump has acknowledged that Mattis did not agree with him about the usefulness of torture as an interrogation tactic but, in a sign of Mattis’ influence, said he would defer the matter to his defense secretary.
