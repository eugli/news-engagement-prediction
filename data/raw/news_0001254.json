There she began her studies in the arts, but her time on campus did not come without scandal. \nDuring her third year, she was accused of poisoning two classmates and was later beaten by anti-abolitionists as a result. The incident prevented her from completing her degree. She then moved to Boston to pursue her sculpting career. However, she had a hard time finding an instructor that would mentor her until she met Edward A. Brackett, whose clients included famous abolitionists. \nLewis soon became a local phenomenon for her work inspired by abolitionists and heroes of the Civil War. To capitalize on her success, she moved to Rome and continued her rise to fame. \nAbroad, Lewis created one of her most famous pieces, \"The Death of Cleopatra,\" which is now housed in the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The same piece is illustrated in her Google Doodle. \nIn 1877, she was commissioned to work on a portrait for President Ulysses S. Grant. \nShe died in 1907 at age 63. \nSince her death, she has been recognized by several institutions, including the Michael Rosenfield Gallery, Howard University, Vassar University and now Google. \nLewis’ animated doodle can be seen at the Google Doodles archive . \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:42:29.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
