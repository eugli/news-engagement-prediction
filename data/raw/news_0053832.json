I was nervous, but told myself to go out and have fun,” said Low from Selangor. \nOn her take on what beautiful body meant, she said confidence was key. \n“It is not just about how you look, but also the confidence in carrying yourself that makes one beautiful,” she said. \nLow, who just completed a bachelor’s degree in Communications, said there was a time in her life when she was not very confident. \nBuilding self-esteem, for her, was through finding herself, trying new things and doing the things she was passionate about. \nThe girls also flaunted their sporty side as they strutted in front of judges and guests, dressed in Ash Be Nimble activewear. \nOther subsidiary titles given out that night included Miss Online Personality, which went to 23-year-old Sonia Naidu from Sarawak for her effective and strategic engagement and communication in social media. \nKarshini Ghanesh, 20, from Johor, won Miss Congeniality, while Samantha Katie James, 23, became the face of Ash Be Nimble as well as La Juiceria.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:07:07.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
