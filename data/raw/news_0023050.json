Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., is expected to serve as a guide for House Democrats as they look to work their way out of what will be at least eight years as the minority House party.\n\"You've heard me talk about the 1964 election where there was an autopsy on the Republican Party, and four years later they won. And in 1972 there was an autopsy done on the Democratic Party and four years later they won the presidency,\" House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told the Washington Examiner . \"He's going to issue an analysis.\"\nHoyer said he has not seen a copy of Maloney's report, but the longtime Maryland Democrat predicted that what comes of it will be \"very instructive.\" Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, also believes the report needs to bring unity to all factions of the Democratic Party, especially those who spurned the party in droves three months ago and supported for Trump.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts   news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

I have a hunch of what it may be,\" Ryan said. He said he hopes the report focuses on \"rural America, inner cities, working class people in places like Youngstown.\"\n\"We've got to go back and say we've got a better vision than the Republicans have for how to turn the country around,\" he said. \"There's still a lot of anxiety, and I think Trump came in and really connected with them, but in some sense he was selling some snake oil.\"\n\"[We need a] unifying economic message that talks about economic justice and opportunity and growth for everybody,\" Ryan continued. \"At some point, Trump's not going to reopen the coal mines. At some point, Trump's not going to bring back the steel mills, and so at that point we better have already laid some ground work as to 'this is our alternative vision for the country.'\"\nDespite the November losses, not all Democrats believe the party is in dire straits. Instead, they're pushing for Democrats to push harder on messages that have worked at times in the past, especially for former President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.\n\"I think at the end of the day, we need to re-inspire millions of people who showed up in 2008 and 2012 who didn't show up in 2016. I don't think we have to reinvent ourselves. I think we know what works,\" said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. \"This message, it's the same message that gave us the House in '06 and the presidency in '08 and the re-election in '12, and we just need those people to again believe that we're fighting for them.\"\nAlso   GOP scrambles to save Trump's labor nominee Republicans have set a cooling off period of sorts for Andy Puzder.\nBy Susan Ferrechio â€¢ 02/08/17 12:01 AM The Baltimore retreat, which will take place at the scenic Inner Harbor, will focus on the party's fight for all Americans and feature speeches from top Democrats and various celebrities, including Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Chelsea Handler, as the party looks to get back on track.\n\"I think it's protect our [healthcare], it's defend our democracy, and also look at what a freedom of opportunity message is going to look like when it comes to extending economic opportunity across the country and holding [Trump] to account for a lot of broken promises he made during the campaign,\" said Swalwell of the issues Democrats need to focus on. \"I think there's a lot to talk about, but we're more unified than I've seen us in the last five years.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:52:53.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
