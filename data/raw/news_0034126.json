The Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation recently had a promotion where a brand of four-litre boxed wine came with free bag of chips.\n\nNslc is giving away a free bag of storm chips with boxed wine in what is the best snowstorm marketing of all time.\n— @gabwhite \nEven companies not offering chips as a gift with purchase are trying to cash in.\n\nStorm chips are for amateurs.

It's an excuse for adults ... to snack,\" said Chapdelaine, whose turf covers Halifax up into Cape Breton.\nChapdelaine said people also like picking up things like chicken wings and cookies, but aren't \"rushing for the canned tuna.\"\nGrocer says chips sales skyrocket Chapdelaine, who has been with Loblaw for 25 years, said people used to stock up on bread and milk before a storm, but that's changed in recent years.\nThe timing coincides with the arrival of #stormchips. Their popularity means if a storm is forecast, Loblaw will bring in more chips to satisfy demand and even open up more shelf space.\n\"It would not be surprising to see chip sales go up by 50 per cent easy and it could be much more than that to be honest, depending on the storm, depending on the weather, depending on the day of the week,\" said Chapdelaine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:19:04.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
