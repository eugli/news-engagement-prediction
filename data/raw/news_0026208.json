So you can trust that there are more items along those languid, colorful lines for Fall. A long-sleeved dress in a micro floral in two shades of blue and red looked charming on the rack, as did its short-sleeved sister.

Having swiftly established the new Diane von Furstenberg as a reliable source for a special dress that won’t blow your budget, Saunders is turning his attention to ensemble dressing for Fall, where his playful mix-and-match approach stands.

A tapestry stripe puffer jacket, for instance, was paired with fluid floral-print pants trailing a long contrasting sash, and an electric blue faux-fur chubby topped a leopard-spot wrap dress that was tossed over camel trousers almost like a robe. He also went hard with accessories, affixing foulards and charms to long chain-strap bags, wrapping scarves around necks, and supersizing earrings.
