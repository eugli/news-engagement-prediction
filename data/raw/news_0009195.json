Panneerselvam removes top Jayalalithaa aides from government Three key faces - Sheela Balakrishnan, K N Venkataramanan, and A Ramalingam, are the other top officials removed from their respective posts By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 5, 2017 10:21 AM Three key faces – Sheela Balakrishnan, K N Venkataramanan, and A Ramalingam, are the other top officials removed from their respective posts. (PTI) \nIn what can be seen as first step towards power shift in Tamil Nadu Government, three top officials appointed by ex-CM Jayalalithaa have been removed from Chief Minister’s office. Indian Express reported that three key faces, Sheela Balakrishnan, K N Venkataramanan, and A Ramalingam, are the other top officials removed from their respective posts. While former chief secretary Sheela Balakrishnan was asked to quit as adviser to the Tamil Nadu government, Jayalalithaa loyalists, including K N Venkataramanan and A Ramalingam, the Secretary I and IV in CMO, were also the other top bearucrats sacked from their posts. Indian Express sources said that while Ramalingam’s removal was expected, Venkataramanan, who had a good rapport with Sasikala as well, had never expected to be removed in the heat of new political changes happening at the top of AIADMK. \nWatch: 5 Lesser Known Facts About Sasikala Natarajan \nA senior AIADMK leader claimed that decision to remove top bearucrats was taken by party chief V K Sasikala and her husband M Natarajan. Sources close to Panneerselvam said that TN CM merely obeyed what party’s top leadership wanted considering various factors including unity in party as well as to avoid multiple power centres at the top of administration. The AIADMK leader said it was Natarajan, once a political mentor of late Jayalalithaa after M G Ramachandran’s death and known for his political talents, has suggested these crucial changes at the helm of the government. ” \nRecently, Sasikala appointed senior leaders, including some former ministers and a former Mayor, to key party posts. Former ministers K A Sengottaiyan, S Gokula Indira and BV Ramana, besides ex-Mayor Saidai S Duraisamy were today appointed as the party’s organisation secretaries. \nThe reports said that Chinamma can take over as CM on February 8 or February 9. A meeting of AIADMK MLAs likely to elect new legislative leader is scheduled to take place tomorrow at their party headquarters.While Sasikala had taken over as the general secretary, Finance Minister O Panneerselvam was appointed as chief minister of state after the demise ex-Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa.
