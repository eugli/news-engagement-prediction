To compensate, Shepherd said the kayaker leaned forward to stop him breaking his back. \nRyan Lucas paddles the Clavey River Californa. \n\"He was unconscious, knocked out and his mate thought he was dead.\" \nREAD MORE: \nShepherd said the Canadian pulled him from the water and began CPR on the riverbed and was able to revive him, saving his life. FILE PHOTO \n\"(He) was very, very agitated and very keen to see us. He was waving some burning sticks to try to get our attention,\" helicopter pilot Nat Every said. \nLater, Lucas was rescued again. At 3am on Tuesday he was found waving burning sticks next to a fire on the riverbed where he had begun to vomit blood. \nThe pair's trip began routinely. They were dropped off at the end of Kiko Rd in the Kaimanawa Forest Park at 3.30pm on Monday. \nThey planned to kayak a section of the river and meet up with friends later. \nBoth men are experienced kayakers, Shepherd said. They've paddled dozens of waterfalls around the world. Ad Feedback \nAfter the waterfall incident and without any means to call for help, the kayakers continued paddling downstream. By this time it was 6.30pm. \n\"On the way down, they missed an exit point but couldn't turn back. I don't quite understand why they didn't walk out to the road end. \n\"With the onset of darkness, the two stopped and lit a fire for warmth.\" \nLeaving Lucas next to the fire, the Canadian went in search of help. \nHe scrambled up a bank of about 100 metres from the river and walked about 5km down a forestry road until he found cell phone reception. \nIt was midnight by the time he was able to call police and St John ambulance, Shepherd said. \n\"Wet, cold, disorientated, injured and coughing blood, the injured kayaker had to wait on his own with no knowledge of when a rescue might come.\" \nA search and rescue operation was initiated just after midnight involving police, St John Ambulance and LandSAR Turangi volunteers. \nGreenlea Rescue Helicopter pilot Nat Every said the helicopter got the callout at 12.30am. \nAs they flew overhead, Every was able to spot the uninjured man using night vision goggles. \nSearching further, the crew found Lucas in a narrow steep-sided part of the river. \n\"[He] was very, very agitated and very keen to see us. He was waving some burning sticks to try to get our attention,\" Every said. \nAfter letting the injured man know he had been seen, the helicopter then guided vehicles through the forest for about 5-10km to get as close to him as possible. \n\"We talked them up to the ridgeline above where this guy was,\" Every said. \nA LandSAR member made his way down the steep banks through thick bush to the river in the dark. \nHe found the injured kayaker and they started to walk back up out of the ravine. It was thought the walk would take about two hours. \n\"We're pretty reluctant to hoist at night ... One of our criteria is whether it's a life or death situation,\" Every said. \nBut then Lucas started vomiting blood and the rescuers realised some of his ribs may have been broken during the CPR. \n\"It came out this guy had been unconscious under water, had been pulled out by his mate, had CPR done on him.\" \nIt was decided to get him to safety as fast as possible. \nWith some of its lights going, the helicopter hovered above the river for five to 10 minutes with about 20 metres of cable out. \nThe injured man was placed in the harness then winched into the machine. \n\"It was a pretty narrow wedge at the bottom of the valley, 20-30 feet of clearance between the helicopter and the river bank. That was as low as we could safely get,\" Every said. \n\"Hovering is hard enough during the day. Hoisting is inherently dangerous work on a helicopter ... It puts you in a position where you are hanging someone under the aircraft and are in proximity to the ground.\" \nThe injured man was flown straight to Taupo Hospital, a flight of about 10 minutes, arriving around 4am. He was due to be transported to Rotorua Hospital on Tuesday. \nShepherd said a personal locator beacon (PLB) could have saved the two several hours of distress. \n\"A PLB should be taken with you in any remote areas for use in emergencies like this. \n\"Cellphone reception isn't needed if you get in trouble and the two wouldn't have needed to split up. \n\"Luckily these two were so fortunate on this occasion, and they had the right knowledge and just enough emergency gear on them to make it out alive.\" \nIn March 2015 Lucas lost his girlfriend Louise Jull during a kayaking trip down the Kaituna River. \nThe 26-year-old Rotorua resident drowned in the river, near Okere Falls, 21 kilometres east of Rotorua. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:30:35.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
