Sign up here .\nSunday night’s Super Bowl was quickly deemed the best football game ever played on that stage. The New England Patriots had the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history, and they won in overtime -- the only overtime ever played in a Super Bowl.\nNow add this to all of those “great” superlatives: it was the most political Super Bowl ever.\nAdvertisement\nFrom President George H.W. Bush’s coin toss , to the subtle and not-so-subtle television ads discussing the nation’s political climate, to the fact that the President Trump has a public friendship with the Patriots’ top three men .\nEven the come-from-behind finish reminded many of the surprising results of the 2016 election. ( Donald Trump Jr. noted this parallel during the game, long before the Patriots staged their comeback.)\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Sign For much of a politically polarized America, the Super Bowl only further underscored the country’s deep divisions (and you thought national football fans were conflicted on coach Bill Belichick!).\nMuch of red America worried about what political statement performer Lady Gaga would make during the half-time show. (She didn’t make one.) Much of blue America didn’t want Trump to be happy about anything, so they were rooting against his very public friends -- Belichick, quarterback Tom Brady, and owner Robert Kraft.\nThe surprise finish? America hasn’t experienced that kind of shock since election night.\nAdvertisement\nAnd the political nature of the game looks like it will continue. Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett says he won’t go to the White House to accept the customary congratulations from the president following his team’s Super Bowl victory.\nJames Pindell can be reached at james.pindell@globe.com .
