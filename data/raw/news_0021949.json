Image copyright Kodi Image caption Kodi software turns compatible devices into a \"media centre\" and is not illegal \nHowever, the software can be modified with third-party add-ons that provide access to pirated copies of films and TV series, or free access to subscription television channels. \nThe sale of these so-called \"fully loaded\" boxes is currently the subject of a legal test . \nThe five arrests were made in Bolton, Bootle, Cheadle, Manchester and Rhyl. \nKieron Sharp, director general of Fact, said the arrests \"should send out a clear warning to anyone involved in the sale and distribution of illegal set-top boxes\". \n\"Set-top boxes loaded with apps and add-ons allowing access to copyright infringing material are very much illegal and anyone involved in selling these boxes should not be surprised to receive a knock on the door,\" he said. \nFact said it had co-ordinated its \"day of action\" on behalf of the Premier League and subscription television providers BT, Sky and Virgin Media. \nThe five have been released on bail following questioning.
