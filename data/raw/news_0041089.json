Sputnik/Kremlin/Mikhail Klimentyev via REUTERS \nMANILA Russia's top security official on Thursday offered the Philippines access to an intelligence database to help it fight crime and militancy, and training for the elite forces assigned to protect President Rodrigo Duterte. \nNikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia's Security Council and Vladimir Putin's top security adviser, made the offer during a meeting between Russian and Philippine security officials in Davao, where he was visiting Duterte at his home city. \nDefense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the Russia had invited the Philippines to join a database-sharing system to help combat trans-national crime and terrorism, which he said could help track Islamist militants and their financial transactions. \nIn an interview with Reuters last week, Lorenzana said there were \"very strong\" links between Islamic State and militants in the Philippines. \nPatrushev's trip underlines Russia's intent to capitalize on a radical recalibration of foreign policy under Duterte, who harbors resentment of the Philippines' deep-rooted ties to the United States. \nDuterte has made strong overtures towards China and Russia. \nHe praised Putin's leadership when he met him at an international summit late last year. He also he talked at length to Putin about what he called U.S. \"hypocrisy\". \nLorenzana said security officials from both sides also discussed law enforcement cooperation, including anti-piracy and anti-narcotics exercises by coastguard and police. \nThe two countries were working on a military technical cooperation agreement, he said, and Russia offered to provide enhanced training for troops protecting Duterte. \nDuterte will visit Moscow in May. \n\"We are keen on signing a defense cooperation agreement,\" Lorenzana said of that trip. \nLorenzana said last week Russia was interested in selling military equipment to the Philippines, like drones, helicopters, rifles and submarines. \n(Reporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Martin Petty) Next In World News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T14:45:35.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
