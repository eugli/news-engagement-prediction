White liberal millennial protestors should take note.\nBoth groups oppose Trump but only the immigrants understand the difference between American civil disobedience and anarchy. More specifically, they're capable of making a cogent argument without any kind of violent coercion.\nThough largely undocumented, the immigrants who walked out of work in the nation's capital and other metropolises have assimilated. They haven't lost faith in America, they haven't repudiated our civil society, and they haven't concluded that those who oppose them are incorrigible. Unlike the liberal protestors who chucked rocks at cops on Inauguration Day, the immigrants took a page out Dr. Martin Luther King's playbook.\nAnd it paid off.\nIn protest of Trump's immigration policies, the majority of the service industry went on strike. Across the country, cooks didn't bake, carpenters didn't frame and maids didn't clean. And while most noticeable in the nation's more liberal cities, it was impossible not to notice. In one indicative episode, the Pentagon's cafeteria shut down as baristas skipped work at Starbucks and fry cooks boycotted Burger King.\nThe owner of Chicago's Frontera Grill shut down his restaurant before summing up the point of the protest. \"What really makes our country great is the diversity we experience here,\" Mr. Bayless told the New York Times. \"I can't say enough about the lack of respect and the fear-mongering and hate-mongering that I'm sensing around us these days.\"\nYou might disagree with that sentiment, think it's wrongheaded, and reject the premise of the protest altogether. But it's hard not to prefer that demonstration to the tantrum that occurred on Inauguration Day. In Washington, D.C., those rioters destroyed private property and engaged in violence. Somehow they thought that by trashing the second most liberal city in America, they'd win converts to their cause.\nOf course, many of Thursday's protesters were illegal immigrants, and by definition, had already broken the law, but their protest proved that they weren't interested in destruction or disorder. More importantly, they seemed much more in touch with the American concept of civil disobedience than many protestors of the occupy ilk. The next four years will have constant demonstrations of various levels of credibility.\nIf I get my choice, I'd pick the most American one. I'd choose immigrants over the black-clad local college and high school kids any day.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Two-thirds of voters say media 'tougher' on Trump than Obama Only 18 percent said former President Barack Obama experienced a harsher press than President Trump.\nBy Anna Giaritelli • 02/17/17 7:53 PM Philip Wegmann is a commentary writer for the Washington Examiner. \nTop Story Democrats and pundits mull ways to remove President Trump Some are  \nBy Byron York • 02/17/17 7:15  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:17:04.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
