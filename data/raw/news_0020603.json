He looks just like dad.”\nMrs Russell, from England, and her daughter Lorraine Barber were met off the flight from the UK by Mr West and his family, wife Wendy, children Jennifer and James, and two grandchildren.\nThe pair were brought together after Mr West’s daughter and wife began researching his family history.\nmedia_camera David West, 68, with sister Veronica Russell, 69, at his home in Collaroy. Pic: Adam Yip/ The Manly Daily\nMr West, who was born in the UK, was adopted at six months old and brought up in Luton, before emigrating to Australia at 19.\nMrs Russell remained with their parents and moved to Grimsby, where she has lived all her life.\nShe was too little to remember she had a brother and his existence was never mentioned within the family. Their parents took the secret to their graves.\nBoth Mr West and Mrs Russell grew up thinking they were only children.\nmedia_camera Wendy West, David West, Veronica Russell and Lorraine Barber, at the West’s home in Collaroy. Adam Yip/ The Manly Daily\nMr West, a former salesman, said it was an exciting moment when his wife unearthed his mother’s death certificate, signed by Mrs Russell.\n“Growing up, I never felt the need to find my birth parents,” said Mr West. “I had a happy childhood and loving adopted parents. But I had always wondered whether I had any brothers or sisters, so when we started to trace my parents, I was most interested to know whether that was the case.”\nmedia_camera Veronica Russell on her wedding day with their dad George Anderson. Adam Yip/ The Manly Daily\nAfter discovering he had a sister and tracking her down, Mr West sent her a letter saying he was looking for help with his family tree. When she responded, he decided to reveal he was her brother in a phone call.\n“I was exceptionally nervous, sweaty palmed,” said Mr West. “She could have quite easily rejected me. It was a bit of a shock for her, but straight away she said. ‘Oh my God, I always wanted a brother’.”\nMrs Russell, who used to be a florist, said it was a complete surprise, but she was delighted. After the initial call, the siblings connected on Facebook and messaged each other every day, before meeting for the first time on Saturday.\nSince arriving in Australia, Mrs Russell has been telling Mr West about his extended family back home — including her two children, seven grandchildren and 13 great grandchildren — and going through old family photos she brought with her.\nmedia_camera Photo of Veronica Russell and their dad George Anderson. Adam Yip/ The Manly Daily\nTheir parents are both dead, George Anderson died aged 72 and Vera, at 99.\n“I’ve been getting a history lesson from Ronny,” said Mr West.\nMeanwhile, he and his wife are already planning a trip to Grimsby this year to meet his 50 or so new relatives.\n“It’s been strange to see some of the family photos and see myself or my children in people I’ve never met,” said Mr West.\n“One of Ronny’s grandchildren looks so much like my son when he was younger.”\nMrs Russell and her daughter said it would be wonderful for the family to meet Mr West, as he was the spitting image of his dad, in looks and personality.\nmedia_camera David West with his sister Veronica Russell, who he loved from the moment he realised she existed, just a few months ago. Adam Yip/ The Manly Daily\nBut, that’s not all. The siblings have been surprised to discover they both suffer from bad backs, have Meniere’s disease which affects the inner ear, the centre of hearing and balance, and are a little deaf in their left ears.\nTheir favourite foods are also the same — shepherd’s pie and jam doughnuts.\nMeanwhile, his niece Mrs Barber, 50, said they wished Mr West had not been kept a secret from them and can only guess at why he was adopted, believing it was because they were poor.\n“I’m still very angry with my nanny for not ever mentioning Dave,” she said. “We knew nothing about him.”\nWhen asked what was the most surprising thing about finding his long lost sister, Mr West said: “The feeling of love. I’ve loved her from the first time I texted her.”", "external_links": ["http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.css", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/b805ccedf53ddfb117e4003b3519130e?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storyheader/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8b9a8898b9610e02d60637fb9f78e2dc?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1ed0d02ef22498ed460eeb06175b4ea2?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/b805ccedf53ddfb117e4003b3519130e?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storymeta/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7da3339d851ebe25a7de8887c5580173?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/517018c5c4880df2b1bf26375b6be966?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d7e13d4e977fba041a0b9d5be1334517?width=650", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2Fb805ccedf53ddfb117e4003b3519130e", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cfc82c7aee2fd864caae32bbb38c5b16?width=650", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2Fb805ccedf53ddfb117e4003b3519130e&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2Fb805ccedf53ddfb117e4003b3519130e", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v2/origin:video_integrator.Y0cHNpOTE6Sx-S6IELjwhxXw3d1esynm?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/manly-daily", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/b805ccedf53ddfb117e4003b3519130e?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Siblings%20reunite%20after%2068%20years&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2Fb805ccedf53ddfb117e4003b3519130e", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2FY0cHNpOTE6Sx-S6IELjwhxXw3d1esynm%2Fpromo310793014&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc"], "published": "2017-02-07T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:56:09.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
