CENA VS. ORTON \nSpeaking to Renee Young on who he’d like to face in his guaranteed title match, he said: “If I know anyone, I know John Cena. \n“I think that whether fans know it or not, they want to see that again. \n“Kudos to him [on tying Ric Flair’s record of 16 world titles], that’s a hell of an achievement, but that means nothing to me. \n“I have 12 world titles under my belt, and whether he has won 15 or 16, it doesn’t matter. I’m going to go out there and beat John.” \nIt’s obvious that the chemistry between the two is unparalleled, and they are capable of having an incredible match at any stage, let alone WrestleMania. \nBut after seeing them face off over 100 times – including live events – it does get stale, and that’s the last thing you’d want at the Grandest Stage of Them All. \nWould you like to see Randy Orton vs. John Cena at WrestleMania 33?
