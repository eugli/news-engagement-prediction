We wish no further comparison will be made to the Jewish Holocaust Israeli Consulate General \nOfficers took turns taking the stage to address the crowd. One speaker was filmed comparing insults officers had received with the Nazi persecution of Jews during the second world war. \nA video recorded by Apple Daily captured an officer addressing the crowds. “I would say it’s like we’re now in the second world war,” the speaker said. “We are Jews. And we’re facing persecution. We are Jews facing the persecution of the Nazis, aren’t we?” \nThe crowd then shouted “yes” in response. \nThe mass gathering, organised by the major police associations, followed the convictions last week of seven officers for assaulting Occupy Central activist Ken Tsang Kin-chiu, who was unarmed at the time, during a protest in October 2014. \nTheir sentencing sparked an outpouring of condemnation by police officers and segments of the public complaining the city’s courts had been far more lenient with Occupy protesters who had broken the law. \nWatch: Hong Kong policemen found guilty in Occupy activist case \nRetired deputy police commissioner Tony Wong Chi-hung, among those present, said he had attended the event to “support my colleagues”. \nA spokesman for the organisers of Wednesday night’s event could not immediately be reached for comment. \nMeanwhile, pro-establishment lawmaker Priscilla Leung Mei-fun of the Business and Professionals Alliance said she planned to introduce laws to criminalise insulting police officers. \n“Amending the existing laws to protect the police from being severely insulted when they are exercising their duty is also meant to protect the public,” she said. \nInsiders worry as anger at officers’ jailing for Ken Tsang beating spreads through Hong Kong police \nHer group has raised HK$5 million in support of the seven officers’ families. \nAlliance vice-chairman and lawmaker Jeffrey Lam Kin-Fung said donations had been pouring in since the idea was circulated among the group’s members and supporters. \nMeanwhile, Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting warned that having a “contempt of cop” law would only “worsen the relationship between the police force and the general public”.
