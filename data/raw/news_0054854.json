advertising accommodation on Airbnb.

Manly Rent a campervan just seconds from the sand on the northern beaches Sarah Swain, Manly Daily February 22, 2017 4:55pm Beaches bomber will be out in seven weeks Beaches housewives to create chaos\nSHREWD  peninsula residents are renting out campervans parked on residential streets a stone’s throw from the ocean.\nFor $50, you can wake up a block from the beach — just as long as you’re willing to hold your bladder.\nThe vans lack toilets or showers and tourists must rely on public facilities, which usually close at night.\nmedia_camera Manly Cove is just a minute away from some of the campervans on offer. Picture: Justin Lloyd.\nNone of them can be moved according to listings on homesharing site Airbnb, which has four campervans on the northern beaches.\nVans are parked on Ashburner St and Victoria Parade, Manly, less than a block from Manly Cove, and two blocks from Manly Beach. They cost $50 to $60 a night.\nYou can also rent a modern RV — with a loo — on somebody’s driveway in Elanora Heights for $74.\nmedia_camera Kyle Mawer, a resident of Ashburner Street, Manly, isn’t happy about the camper vans are parking on his street and advertising accommodation on Airbnb. Picture: Justin Lloyd.\nOne local blasted the campervan owners for taking up parking spaces and making money from it.\nThe two seen by the Manly Daily displayed Manly Council parking permits.\nOil rig worker, Kyle Mawer, 26, who lives on Ashburner St, said: “It’s the hottest parking zone in town. It definitely sucks. Some of the vans never seem to move. I have to drive around for half an hour to find a space.”\nHowever, unless somebody complains, there is not much Northern Beaches Council can do.\nmedia_camera The facilities include a cooking stove for those who know how to cook. media_camera One of the $50 a night vans even has fairy lights. Better than a fancy hotel.\nIt is not illegal to sleep in a car or campervan as long as it complies with road rules, including any ‘no camping’ signs. Campervans parked on a homeowners’ land are allowed to be lived in — but only by the householders.\nOne van listed as “Manly Glamping” costs $50 and boasts it’s “like camping, but fancier” has a “real bed”, stove, cold storage and power to charge your phone.\nmedia_camera One of the listings online.\nIt’s parked on Ashburner St, a minute walk from Manly Cove, near multimillion-dollar apartments.\nReviews from people as far afield as the US and UK are glowing — except when it comes to the bathroom.\nOne said: “The only downside was that the toilets are like a five-minute walk away, which if you wake up in the middle of the night can be a bit of a pain.”\nmedia_camera Some of the vans have “real beds”.\nThey are a step up from accommodation listed on Airbnb last year in Chifley, which was $15 a night for a blow-up mattress on the floor of a “small but cluttered” dining room , near the kitchen, only a shortish walk from Long Bay Jail.\nThe “bedroom” was listed on Airbnb and came with the one catch, the description said it may not be suitable for people under 13 years old.\nManly tourism boss Meegan Clancy dubbed the move “resourceful” but also said it could be a headache for locals, and potentially unsafe for visitors.\n“Airbnb has opened the world of sofa beds, backyards tents and everything in-between,” she said.\nmedia_camera You could spend the night in a campervan — but not here, on a Manly street.\n“However, parking on the street and running a commercial operation while using a residential parking permit, is not only opportunistic and cheeky but inconvenient and unsafe for the traveller, other parking users, and surrounding residents.”\nThe State Government’s rules on illegal camping say councils are “encouraged to be proactive in preventing illegal camping,” especially “potential damage from noise, scattering of rubbish, or inadequate toilet facilities.”\nmedia_camera The deluxe option — a campervan with a bathroom.\nAirbnb remains a grey area and is the subject of a state senate inquiry, which Northern Beaches Council said it was awaiting the results of.\nOn the peninsula the activity is still governed by the old council areas. Pittwater Council allowed short-term rentals and Manly bed and breakfasts; Warringah allowed people to rent out a room, but not a house.\nWHAT YOU DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT THE NBN What you didn't know about the NBN 1:15 Explaining a few things you might not have known about the change.\nFebruary 22nd 2017 10 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ What you didn't know about the NBN Airbnb, which has 22,000 Sydney listings, did not provide a response by deadline.\nTwo years ago a park in Sydney’s inner west was home to 60 backpackers in vans.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERS AND NEWS ALERTS", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0b00e9e3ac2fbd4c441709e33e951513?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cb4bf2433f28600b9c9bbb4b20a08220?width=650", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Fancy%20a%20van-cation%3F%20Try%20Vanbnb&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2Fd17278942b6b0c458e1334976146d2fc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2F9iZDJ4OTE63e90nUh5fATaQd1IfVvV_e%2Fpromo312009355&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/d17278942b6b0c458e1334976146d2fc?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storymeta/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/198811d1adc125aba3113092cf907ec8?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/271eab1f8ac7b5f257311c2daed0984e?width=316", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v2/origin:video_integrator.9iZDJ4OTE63e90nUh5fATaQd1IfVvV_e?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c47cad46fcc8b21acbf29b38bca5a740?width=650", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.js", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2Fd17278942b6b0c458e1334976146d2fc", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/d17278942b6b0c458e1334976146d2fc?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storyheader/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/d17278942b6b0c458e1334976146d2fc?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.css", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/df6ad292c164d658416fc39552593a25?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/manly-daily", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6c868611c6cb221bbfb690b41d9e4cf7?width=316", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ff9cd31bc7f1f1b5ba478b93d256121d?width=650", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2Fd17278942b6b0c458e1334976146d2fc&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2Fd17278942b6b0c458e1334976146d2fc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/68b9142b773780468ee080bd0a3c9053?width=1024", "https://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPCv2/?a=DailyTelegraph"], "published": "2017-02-21T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:56:45.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
