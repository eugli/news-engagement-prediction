Online scams are increasingly complex and transnational in nature.\n\"To the criminals who think that they could hide behind the cloak of anonymity provided by the Internet to perpetrate fraud, we want to send a deterrent message that crime does not pay.\"\nAccording to the SPF's 2016 crime statistics released last week, Internet love scams in Singapore hit an all-time high.\nThere were 636 cases, up from 385 in 2015. The total amount cheated was also the highest by far at $24mil (RM75mil) - double the $12mil (RM38mil) victims were fooled into giving in 2015. â€“ The Straits Times/Asia News Network", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:33:10.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
