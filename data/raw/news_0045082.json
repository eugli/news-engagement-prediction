But Mrs Hussein had allowed her seven months pregnant daughter-in-law to use it and instead walked on the other side of the stairs. Lawyers for the club say that, given her size at the time, whether she was on the right or left, she would still have been able to reach the rail. The lighting was considered adequate in the stairwell, which was also an emergency exit, the court was told. The judge was also referred to medical notes following Mrs Hussein's arrival at St Thomas' Hospital in an ambulance. The club's owners say lighting was perfectly adequate and there was a handrail which Mrs Hussein could have used. Pictured, the exterior of Ronnie Scott's jazz club In the document, a doctor or nurse had recorded 'intoxicated' as their impression of the patient. But Mrs Hussein, who had been given gas and air due to her pain, vehemently denied that she was drunk. She had not had a drink in six months before the accident and had only a glass and a half of champagne and a small amount of red wine before the fall, she said. 'It could be from the gas and air,' she said, explaining why medics might have thought she was drunk. Her barrister, Kiril Waite, argues that lighting in the stairwell was no good enough and that an adequate risk assessment had not been carried out. If Mrs Hussein's claim is successful, her compensation payout will then be assessed, if not agreed. The hearing continues.
