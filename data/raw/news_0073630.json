That is, in fact, very old news. But a new study of 52,000 adults in the Archives of Sexual Behavior suggests orgasming isn't an issue of gender—male vs. female, he vs. she—but an issue of sexuality.\nThe researchers highlighted data proving lesbian women orgasm more than straight women—a lot more. For instance, 86 percent of women having sex with women reported usually or always orgasming, while only 65 percent of straight women reported the same. Sixty-six percent of bisexual women said they usually/always achieved orgasmed. In largely un-shocking statistics, 95 percent of heterosexual men reported almost always orgasming, as did 89 percent of homosexual men. This all helps explain the \"orgasm gap\" between genders in terms of sexual partners, not solely gender.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below The researchers also pinpointed a \"golden trio\"— their words —of sexual acts that were most likely to achieve orgasm for women: genital stimulation, deep kissing, and oral sex, performed in combination with vaginal penetration. Other factors they identified as leading to more frequent female orgasms were experimentation in bed, relationship satisfaction, and women asking for what they want from their partners.\nAlso notable: 41 percent of straight men reported that their partner always reached orgasm. However, only 33 percent of heterosexual women reported they always orgasmed. So there's apparently a sizable gap in communication as well.\n[h/t: The Guardian ] From: Esquire\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": ["http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/news/a53416/best-female-orgasm/", "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/23/golden-trio-of-moves-boosts-chances-of-female-orgasm-say-researchers", "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%252Fs10508-017-0939-z"], "published": "2017-02-25T16:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:41:20.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
