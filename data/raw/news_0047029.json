"highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "Map: WA \nThe WA Labor Party says it expects the Prime Minister will back down on a threat to prevent $1.2 billion in Perth Freight Link funding being diverted to the party's flagship transport project Metronet. \nThe Prime Minister said the federal money pledged for the freight link, which aims to build a byway for heavy haulage trucks to Fremantle Port, was not a \"general grant\" to be used at the WA Government's discretion. \n\"It will reduce the cost of moving freight, reduce congestion, improve safety and generally improve the amenity for communities across the south metropolitan area of Perth,\" he said. \n\"If any future state government in Western Australia were to decide not to proceed with this project then obviously the money allocated to that project would no longer be available.\" \nThe WA Labor Party have vowed to axe the controversial plan, and want to use part of the $1.2 billion of federal money to instead build Metronet, which aims to build train lines linking the east and west of the city, which currently only has lines connecting in the city. \nLabor's shadow treasurer Ben Wyatt dismissed the Prime Minister's comments and said he was \"100 per cent certain\" the federal money would go towards Metronet if his party was elected. \n\"Malcolm Turnbull ... is simply trying to prop up a tired old Premier with a tired old agenda, trying to get Colin Barnett over the line,\" he said. \n\"What Mr Turnbull is saying ultimately is that he will rip more money out of Western Australia if they elect a Labor Government. \n\"But in the end, Malcolm Turnbull 'Captain Capitulation', like every other issue he's ever stood for, he'll capitulate on this and it makes me even more confident that WA will get that money if they elect a Labor government. \nFederal Infrastructure Minister Paul Fletcher has previously indicated the Federal Government will not allow the funds to be diverted . \nFederal Opposition spokesman for infrastructure Anthony Albanese said Metronet was badly needed by Perth commuters who faced increased gridlock on the roads. \n\"[Perth Freight Link] is a classic case of not getting the planning right,\" he said in a statement. \n\"Mr Turnbull is now compounding this error by championing this dud project to rescue the flailing Barnett State Government in next month's WA election. \n\"WA voters should treat his standover tactic with the contempt it deserves.\" Liberals, Labor hold rival campaign launches \nThe Prime Minister's comments came as Western Australia's two major parties are set to officially launch their state election campaigns today, but neither will be joined by its federal leader. \nThe latest opinion poll suggests Western Australia's March 11 vote will be extremely close, with the Liberals and Labor tied at 50-50 on a two-party preferred basis . \nMr Turnbull is unable to attend this morning's state Liberal Party campaign launch but he will arrive in Perth later this afternoon. \nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten will also be absent from his state counterparts' event, however a spokesman said Mr Shorten would return to WA before polling day. \nBoth leaders are in the Northern Territory today commemorating the 75th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin. \nIt has been a month since Pauline Hanson travelled to Perth to launch One Nation's state election campaign, while the WA Nationals unveiled their campaign in Bunbury earlier this month.", "external_links": [], "published":
