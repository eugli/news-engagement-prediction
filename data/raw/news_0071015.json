Currently, there are approximately 10,000 to 12,000 troops released each year. A 2013 study commissioned for the federal government show nearly one-third of military members (27 per cent) \"reported a difficult adjustment.\"\nGen. Jonathan Vance says his objective is to 'professionalize' the process of releasing military members. (Fred Chartrand/Canadian press)\nThe country's top defence chief acknowledged the growing public complaints in a recent speech, saying his objective is to overhaul and \"professionalize\" the process of releasing military members.\n\"We want to make certain — I have the same ambition that anybody else would have: I'd love for your pension cheque to be ready the next day, all of your care in place, everything from your move,\" Gen. Jonathan Vance told the Conference of Defence Associations Institute. \"That is our aspiration and it has improved a great deal even this past year.\"\nThe country's military ombudsman is worried that patience has been exhausted and that more ex-soldiers will see the courts as a reasonable recourse instead.\n\"It's just going to gum the system up with a whole of bunch of litigation,\" said Walbourne. \"It's going to cause more delays and more bureaucracy to come to bear. So I'd rather we didn't find ourselves having to get to that extreme.\"\nWalbourne has been advocating for the military to not release members until all of their financial and health arrangements are in place.\nAn impersonal process Vance, in his speech, countered that the system has been trying to do that.\nThe internal documents say a variety of factors caused the pension and severance backlogs.\nStaffing cuts under the former Conservative government, the introduction of pensions for reservists in 2007 and the increasing number of soldiers released on medical grounds — roughly 2,500 per year — have made the system ungainly.\nThe internal documents acknowledge the system is impersonal and \"intended to terminate employment rather than assist the member from military to civilian life.\"\nThe role and expectations of well-meaning politicians and military brass have also made things worse, according to one presentation contained in the documents, dated Dec. 16, 2016.\n\"The many significant personnel initiatives encouraged by senior leadership to look after our people have incrementally complicated the release/transition process to the point where a radical revision was warranted … re-engineering rather than tweaking,\" the presentation said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:33:34.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
