A Dominican Republic newspaper apparently couldn't tell the difference. \nAs several news outlets have observed, El Nacional ran a story Friday about the U.S. President and his positions on Israeli settlements. There, on the right, was a photo of serious-faced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Dominican newspaper uses picture of Alex Baldwin instead of president Trump. pic.twitter.com/exxsAufnrd — You Had One Job (@_youhadonejob1) February 11, 2017 \nOn the left? An Associated Press image of a purse-lipped Baldwin in full resting fish-face, from NBC's Saturday Night Live , where he has been regularly playing the role, to the President's apparent exasperation. Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 \nCoincidentally, Baldwin will be hosting this weekend's show. \nThe newspaper published a correction soon thereafter, but not before the Twittersphere had gotten its hands all over it, mocking \"that awkward moment when\" the error that was bound to happen finally happened. Unbelievable! Dominican newspaper @ElNacional_RD uses wrong picture of Trump.

But let's hope the Dominican Republic isn't added to Trump's banned countries list.\" \nLondon's The Independent noted that the El Nacional article \"was not intended to be satirical or tongue-in-cheek, which makes the entire error more hilarious.\" \nWhether any publication will accidentally use a photo of Melissa McCarthy impersonating Sean Spicer instead of the actual White House press secretary remains to be seen.
