'Goal and dream' \nShe also completed solo rides between Land's End and John O'Groats, and throughout Australia, New Zealand and Chile. \nBefore setting off on the Atlantic challenge, from the Canary Islands in December, Ms Hopley said her mother, who was diagnosed with dementia played an important role in inspiring her crossing. \nShe said: \"I love adrenaline sports and it has always been a goal and dream to cross an ocean, that for years has remained unfulfilled, as I have needed to support my mother who was diagnosed with dementia. \n\"I feel the need to raise funds for this little understood disease and this crossing is dedicated to her.\" \nThe overall race winners were Anglo-American quartet Latitude 35, who broke the race record to finish in just under 36 days.
