The couple has three children, all who are U.S. citizens, she added to the News-Tribune.\n“They violated our rights,” Grace Chavez told the paper. “He was the victim of the accident.”\nBut a Republican lawmaker from Tacoma isn’t happy about what’s happening to the trooper.\n“I’m concerned that this investigation is motivated at least in part by the governor nationalizing this issue, when it shouldn’t be,” State Sen. Steve O’Ban told the News Tribune.\nO’Ban also wrote a letter to Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee about the incident, calling the trooper review “puzzling, if not deeply concerning,” the paper said, adding that Inslee has been critical of Republican President Donald Trump’s immigration policies of late.\n“I fear launching an administrative review of this routine and common-sense procedure sends a chilling message to WSP troopers and to other law enforcement personnel that undermines public safety by discouraging officers from gaining potentially vital information from federal authorities,” O’Ban wrote, the News Tribune said.\nThe governor’s office confirmed it received O’Ban’s letter but wouldn’t comment on it, the paper said.\n(H/T: Washington Examiner )", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:39:38.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
