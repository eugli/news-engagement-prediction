Two-time NBA Champion and current Sydney Kings big-man Josh Powell joins the show to talk about his hometown of Atlanta, NBA titles, President Trump, philanthropy, and the NBL. \nSubscribe to the podcast on iTunes by CLICKING HERE . \nThe massive caloric intake doesn’t affect Maker as much as one would assume, because of what Zell describes as ‘one of the fastest metabolisms I’ve ever seen’. \nAccording to the Bucks’ director of performance Troy Flanagan, who was previously based in Australia, Maker has the highest aerobic capacity of any player on his team. \n“Which is a really good sign,” Troy Flanagan said. \n“Because if you’re bulking somebody up, they have to have that sort of engine to carry the extra mass. Some people you put on extra mass, and it essentially deteriorates their performance. But he’s definitely not in that category.” media_camera Thon Maker. \nThe goal for the Bucks is to increases Maker’s weigh to the point where he reaches the 230-240 lbs range and, when he does, his teammates have incredibly high hopes for his development and the kind of player he could turn into. \nFrom 12-year veteran Jason Terry to the league’s newest superstar, Giannis Antetokounmpo, the expectations for Maker are sky high. \n“When I look at Mr. Maker, the first impression you get is: This kid resembles Kevin Garnett a little bit, just in his stature and build,” Terry told the magazine. \n“And then you watch him play? And you’re like, ‘Whoa.’” \nAntetokounmpo compared the Australian to himself: “I see some similarities.” \nThe ‘Greek Freak’ continued by adding that Maker is “lot better player” than he was at the age of 19. \n“He wants to be great. He’s not scared to say it. Like, he come up to me and be like, ‘I’m trying to follow in your footsteps. I’m trying to do what you did. And I’ll do whatever it takes’.” \nWhile everyone, from his Bucks teammates, to coaches, to the front office, see Maker’s endless potential, it’s the big-man, himself, who expresses the most confidence. \n“I’m going to be an All-Star,” Maker said. \n“I’m going to be a champion. Not just one, multiple times. I’m going to be an MVP. I’m going to be Defensive Player of the Year. Not just once, multiple times. … And the rings part is the biggest one for me. And the Hall of Fame part.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:55:04.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
