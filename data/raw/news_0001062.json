Though there obviously are exceptions, these places can usually be broken down into two kinds.\nThe first is the corner Greek-American joint with the cone of compressed meat spinning lazily in the kitchen. Workers shave meat onto an oversize pita, flood it with white sauce and top it with tomatoes and sliced onion. Some places take the necessary time to ensure that the slivers are nicely seared and crisp (nice job, Big Boy Gyros and Beef & Burger!), while most rush the job and serve up limp gray strands of meat and call it a day. (You know who you are.)\nThe second is a stylish quick-service Mediterranean concept. In the Loop alone, a good dozen have different names but serve nearly the exact same menu — some combination of falafel, shawarma and kebabs on pita. Though some are far better than others (thumbs up to Naf Naf Grill, Benjyehuda and Olive Mediterranean Grill), we are a bit saturated.\nSo call me jaded when I first approached Dox Quality Greek in Wicker Park, which is both a neighborhood Greek joint (obviously) and a quick-service concept with pita. But when I walked in, the atmosphere was open and calming, with pristine white tile lining the walls. No preformed cone of meat was rotating. Then I looked at the menu and noticed grilled octopus.\nDox is run by the team behind Greek Kitchen, one of those Mediterranean concepts downtown, and, most important, chef Christos Fasseas, who was born and raised in Athens, Greece. That means the menu is full of dishes that you'd never find at your usual Greek-American joint, including octopus. Talking over the phone, he notes that \"everyone serves octopus\" in Greece, so it wasn't such a big deal to add it to the menu. He cooks it for five hours sous vide with orange peel and olive oil, then finishes it on the grill.\nAs you can imagine, the grilled octopus is astonishingly tender, with a wonderful smoky aroma. It rests on a creamy puree of fava beans, which chef Fasseas insists be imported from Santorini, a tiny Greek island, because he likes the flavor better than domestic dried favas. This dish wouldn't be out of place at some trendy West Loop spot, yet you can pick up the offering for $8.50.\nInstead of a grilled lamb gyro, Dox offers luscious braised lamb ($8.50 for two) on pita. \"Leg of lamb is classic in Greece,\" says chef Fasseas. \"I wanted to get that flavor of rosemary, thyme, oregano and lemon.\" Unlike most meat-heavy gyros served in Chicago, the pita is topped with freshly made tzatziki studded with beets, cooling cucumber salsa and salty feta. Each bite is actually balanced.\nAs satisfying as the lamb is, the charred veggies ($7 for two) might be even better. Featuring a mix of grilled zucchini and red pepper, each is topped with a bright and slightly sweet tomato jam, crunchy pistachios and mizithra cheese, a soft Greek-style cheese.\nDox Quality Greek in Wicker Park is like a neighborhood joint and a modern quick-service spot, but with tender octopus, standout lamb on pita and more Regardless of the filling, each is held on a fantastically soft pita, much smaller and thinner than you are probably used to. Employees call them taco-sized, which is just about right. \"I wanted people to taste what's inside the pita, not just the bread,\" says chef Fasseas. Dox gets the pitas made especially for them by an undisclosed local company. Each order includes two fully stuffed pitas, which makes for a good lunch or a satisfying dinner if paired with a side.\nThose pita also make excellent vessels for Dox's collection of dips, including the smoked eggplant ($4.75) and actually spicy roasted red pepper and feta ($5).\nFasseas is adamant about cooking everything to order, which partly explains why it takes slightly longer to get the kebabs to your table than other items. \"The kebabs take a little time, because I don't want to precook those,\" says Fasseas. \"I'm trying to keep the flavors as fresh as possible.\" They are worth the wait. The juicy beef short ribs ($9.25) are wonderfully tender and heavily seasoned. They arrive atop a bed of fries with a side of tzatziki, pita and charred lemon.\nDox's salad options leave the ubiquitous Greek-American salad, with its watery lettuce, far behind. The most similar option is the arugula salad ($8), a brimming bowl of bright green leaves with bright cherry tomatoes, crunchy cucumber and salty feta. Mixed in is tender farro. It's also a hefty portion — big enough for a filling lunch.\nDox also skips the ubiquitous Greek Chicago staple of flaming saganaki, going with charred haloumi $6, which is a Mediterranean-style cheese. Instead of being doused with alcohol and set alight, it's dressed with a bright and colorful cherry tomato-ouzo vinaigrette. So sure, you'll miss the pyrotechnics and shouts of \"Opa!\" but that's a small price for something so visually stunning and delicious.\nDox also offers either half ($12) or whole ($20) rotisserie chickens, which include pita bread. The birds are simply prepared, brined and delicately seasoned, and served with grilled lemon wedges. Since the restaurant uses high-quality birds from Slagel Family Farms, each bite is full-flavored and miles better than the greasy rotisserie birds from the local grocery store.\nAny new restaurant serving this quality food would be worth checking out. What's astonishing about all of these dishes is that besides the chicken, which feeds more than one person, each costs less than $10. If you feel you're in a rut with Greek food in Chicago, it won't cost much to break out.\n1566 N.
