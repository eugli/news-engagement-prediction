The US Supreme Court is set to consider an appeal by the parents of an unarmed Mexican teenager who was killed by a US border patrol agent. \nAgent Jesus Mesa was on the US side when he fatally shot Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca, 15, across the Mexican border in June 2010. \nAgent Mesa was not prosecuted or extradited to face criminal charges. \nThe case could determine the scope of US law and whether non-citizens are protected by American courts. Mexico protesters march against Trump's immigration policies \nAgent Mesa was on a bicycle patrol between El Paso, Texas, and Juarez, Mexico, when he shot and killed the Mexican teenager. \nSergio was among a group at a cement culvert by an 18ft (5.4 metres) high border fence when Agent Mesa tried to apprehend them. \nHe caught one of the boys while two others on the Mexican side ran and hid behind a pillar. Media caption Hundreds protest ‘wall’ at Mexican border \nThe teenager's family said he was just playing with friends. \nBut the Justice Department said the officer was trying to stop \"smugglers attempting an illegal border crossing\". \nAgent Mesa said in court documents that he opened fire after rocks were thrown at him from across the border, including by Sergio. \nMobile phone footage showed that Sergio was struck as he peeked out from behind a pillar, according to the petitioner's brief. \nUS officials decided against prosecuting Agent Mesa, arguing the Justice Department lacked jurisdiction on the Mexican side of the border. \nThough Mexican officials charged Agent Mesa with murder, the Obama administration refused to extradite him. \nThe teenager's parents sued Agent Mesa for damages, but lower courts dismissed the lawsuit. The Supreme Court agreed to take up the case in October. \nThe case comes in the wake President Donald Trump's order for the \"immediate construction\" of a border wall and the hiring of an additional 5,000 border patrol agents.
