Bill Akins, the secretary of the Republican executive committee in Florida's Pasco County, became the star of a CNN segment after he was heckled for saying that the Affordable Care Act created death panels for the elderly.\n“There's a provision in there that anyone over the age of 74 has to go before what is effectively a death panel,” said Akins at a town hall led by Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.), who represents a safe GOP seat on the state's Gulf Coast. “Yes, they do! Yes, they do! It's in there, folks!”\nAkins, hardly a public figure until the town hall, was representative of a phenomenon that burbled under the headlines in 2016, and burst through after President Trump's victory. After eight years of a Democratic presidency that enraged Republican activists, conspiracy thinking frequently went viral on conservative social media accounts. Some lower-level Republican officials fell for the theories, and shared them, too. A quick look through Akins's account over the past year reveals almost daily examples of false, misleading or bigoted stories and memes being shared for his audience.\n1. Black rioters can be compared to monkeys. \n(Via Facebook) 2. “Chemtrails” left by airplanes are a public health risk. \n(Via Facebook) 3. Hillary Clinton murdered her political opponents. \n(Via Facebook) 4. Antonin Scalia might have been murdered. \n(Via Facebook) 5. Saudi Arabia funded Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. \n(Via Facebook) 6. Nancy Pelosi is mentally handicapped. \n(Via Facebook) 7. Former president Barack Obama was foreign-born and Muslim. \n(Via Facebook) 8. The left is engendering hatred against white people. \n(Via Facebook) 9. “Climate change” is a globalist hoax. \n(Via Facebook) 10. President Trump's inauguration crowd was bigger than photos portrayed. \n(Via Facebook) 11. Muslims can't claim racial discrimination. \n(Via Facebook) 12. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called for women to be raped by Muslims. \n\n(Via Facebook) That quote, an obvious fake, was debunked by Snopes last month . But none of Akins's posts seemed to hurt Republican performance in his county. After voting for Mitt Romney over Obama in 2012 by 7 points, the county gave Trump a 21-point landslide victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:05:24.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
