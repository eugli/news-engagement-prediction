Zlatan was going on again about a poor pass from Mido and then Mido exploded. He threw the scissors right at Zlatan. But they eventually sorted that problem between them. \n“I trained with Zlatan, I played with him and used to spend lots of time with him away from football. \n“What he’s showing now every week at United, I used to see exactly the same at Ajax all those years ago. He always wants to score. In every match, in every trainings session.

That’s how he lives his life. \n“At the same time, he’s never prejudiced. He doesn’t care who you are, what you do, he values everyone as a person. If he likes you, he’ll do anything for you. But if he doesn’t like you, be aware!” \nEverton boss Ronald Koeman, who managed Ibrahimovic at Ajax, recalled how tough it was dealing with the striker’s frequent mood swings, although he never doubted his talent and professionalism. \n“Zlatan was not an easy character,” said Koeman. “He’d go home after a day’s training in a happy mood with a big smile on his face.

You never knew what mood he was in. \n“I invested a lot of time in helping Zlatan. I had many talks with him. He was young, living on his own in Amsterdam and was a bit mischievous at times. \n“I can’t remember if he and Mido were driving a Porsche or a Maserati, but I do know that they drove very fast around the stadium. The next day I was asked to have talks with him.

The other week I was having dinner with my wife in Manchester and he walked into the same restaurant. He came over to my table and we had a nice chat. We’ve always kept a mutual respect.” \nAnother former team-mate, Johnny Heitinga, hailed Ibrahimovic’s physical strength and mental fortitude as his chief assets, with his will to win giving a crucial edge to all of his teams. \n“People don’t realise how strong Zlatan is,” said Heitinga. “He’s like Tarzan, a strong as a dinosaur. Why do you think he’s won so many trophies?
