Photo: Bloomberg \n\"So Jamie Dimon does know Dodd-Frank – like a mobster knows RICO [the laws the US used to go after the Mafia among others].\" So Jamie Dimon does know Dodd-Frank -- like a mobster knows RICO 12/ — AFR (@RealBankReform) February 3, 2017 \nIn the ructions over Trump's migration crackdown, the President's scene-setting for doing away with Dodd-Frank and the Fiduciary Rule has garnered little attention in the midst of a blizzard of executive orders, memorandums and declarations of intent. \nIn the Obama years, an army of corporate lobbyists and lawyers invested hundreds of millions of dollars fighting Dodd-Frank – as it went through congress and again in a subsequent, tortuous process of drafting the regulation through which the Act was being implemented. \nDodd-Frank also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a heroic agency that has clawed back more than $US12 billion for millions of \"forgotten\" Americans who were victims of abusive mortgage, credit-card and other lending vehicles by \"establishment\" financial institutions that continued their robber baron ways after the Great Recession. \nTrump parses his economic plans as help for both Wall Street and workers, by releasing them from regulatory constraints to allow banks to lend more to companies, which, he says, will then hire more workers. \n\"We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank , because frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine that had nice businesses, they can't borrow money,\" Trump said during a meeting with business leaders in the State Dining Room at the White House. \n\"They just can't get any money because the banks just won't let them borrow it because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank .\" \nIn truth, in talking about \"nice businesses\" that can't borrow Trump appears to be talking about himself – much of his recent borrowing have been from the German Deutsche Bank, because after his serial defaults and bankruptcies American banks shied away from lending to him; and surveys show that as few as 4 per cent of small businesses, a historic low, are unhappy with current loan availability. \nIn a derisory attack on the Fiduciary Rule, Trump's new national economic council chief Gary Cohn told The Wall Street Journal : \"We think it's a bad rule … like putting only health food on the menu, because unhealthy food tastes good. But you still shouldn't eat it because you might die younger.\" \nSticking to his restaurant analogy, Cohn described Trump's reform pronouncement as a \"table setter for a bunch of stuff that is coming, [including] dismantling the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation. \n\"Americans are going to have better choices and Americans are going to have better products because we're not going to burden the banks with literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year,\" he told the Journal . \nBut New York Times economics commentator Paul Krugman turned Cohn's restaurant analogy on its head. Denouncing Trump's economic policies as empowering ethically challenged businesses to cheat and exploit \"the little guy\", he writes: \"If you want a better analogy, it's like preventing restaurants from claiming that their 1400-calorie portions are health food.\" \nIn 2015, an Obama administration study found that the kind of \"conflicted investment advice\" that would become illegal under the Fiduciary Rule reduced total earning for retirees by about 1 per cent – that's a whopping $US17 billion a year that, Krugman points out, mostly ends up in the pockets of financial-industry players. \n\"The administration apparently plans to turn over financial regulation to Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs, and make it easier for them and other big banks like Wells Fargo to steal from their customers and destabilise the economy,\" says Lisa Donner, the executive director of Americans for Financial Reform. \"That betrays the promises Trump made to stand up to Wall Street.\" \nCaptured at the height of last year's election campaign, the Wells Fargo scandal, alluded to by Donner, was a credibility-enhancing scalp for the fledgling CFPB. Wells Fargo, with 40 million retail customers, was fined $US185 million for a scam in which the bank signed millions of customers up for accounts, credit cards, and services without their consent or knowledge – an industrial scale machine for raking in extra fees that known by the industry term \"cross selling\". \nThe bank sacked more than 5000 lowly staffers. But senior executives got off scot-free, provoking a sensational showdown at a Senate hearing in September 2016, in which Massachusetts senator and consumer-protection firebrand Elizabeth Warren eviscerated Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf. \nReminding many Democrats of why she would have been a more effective Democratic presidential candidate than Hillary Clinton, Warren opened by focusing on an oft-stated Stumpf claim: \"I am accountable.\" \nWarren: … what have you actually done to hold yourself accountable? Have you resigned as CEO or chairman of Wells Fargo? \nStumpf: No, I have not. \nWarren: Alright. Have you returned one nickel of the millions of dollars that you were paid while this scam was going on? \nStumpf: Well, first of all, this was by 1 per cent of our people. \nWarren: That's not my question. This is about responsibility. Have you returned one nickel of the millions of dollars that you were paid while this scam was going on? [...] \nWarren: OK, so you haven't resigned, you haven't returned a single nickel of your personal earnings, you haven't fired a single senior executive. Instead evidently your definition of \"accountable\" is to push the blame to your low-level employees who don't have the money for a fancy PR firm to defend themselves. It's gutless leadership … \n\"You know, here is what really gets me about this, Mr Stumpf. If one of your tellers took a handful of $20 bills out of the cash drawer, they probably would be looking at criminal charges for theft. \n\"They could end up in prison. But you squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they would cheat customers and you could drive up the value of your stock and put hundreds of millions of dollars in your own pocket. \n\"And when it all blew up, you kept your job, you kept your multimillion-dollar bonuses and you went on television to blame thousands of $12 an hour employees who were just trying to meet cross-sell quotas that made you rich. This is about accountability. You should resign … \n\"But Wall Street executives almost never hold themselves accountable. \n\"Not now, and not in 2008 when they crushed the worldwide economy.\" \nAfter that Stumpf was shamed into quitting. But Wall Street being what it is, Stumpf was \"let go\", to coin that quaint Americanism for being sacked, with a $US130-plus million package to salve his wounded dignity. \nTrump does not have the power to dispatch Dodd-Frank with a stroke of his presidential pen – because it is an act of Congress. But Republicans have signalled that in the face of resistance in Congress, they would resort to a time-honoured practice of neutering​ the act, by chipping away at the regulations and crippling the agencies that implement them by slashing their funding. \nIn laying out his plan to euthanise the Dodd-Frank Act , Trump declared: \"The American dream is back.\" \nAs Wall Street waged guerilla warfare on the Dodd-Frank Act in 2009, then-president Barack Obama, for whom saving the economy after the 2008-09 financial crisis and Dodd-Frank are legacy jewels, famously remarked: \"I didn't run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street.\" \nFast forward to the 2016 presidential campaign, and Americans would be forgiven for thinking Trump was saying the same thing.
