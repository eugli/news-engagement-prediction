Whispers of sexism at Uber exploded into a full-blown public relations crisis over the weekend, after one former Uber engineer published a blog post alleging that upper management ignored her complaints about sexual harassment and a toxic workplace culture at the world’s most valuable private tech company. Now, days after Susan Fowler’s essay went viral, dozens more people have come forward with their own stories about life at Uber. According to more than 30 current and former employees who spoke to Mike Isaac at The New York Times , the problems at Uber go well beyond those described by Fowler, including an incident in which an Uber manager allegedly groped female co-workers during a company retreat in Las Vegas (the manager was fired within 12 hours, the Times reports). Uber’s Las Vegas retreat also reportedly featured drugs and an employee taking co-workers for a joyride in a private shuttle bus. In a separate incident, the Times reports, an Uber manager “threatened to beat an underperforming employee’s head in with a baseball bat.” In one particularly heated exchange, a director allegedly “shouted a homophobic slur” at someone who reported to them. The Times report bolsters claims made by Fowler that upper management at Uber was aware of problems stemming from the company’s aggressive, sometimes sexist workplace culture, but that top-performing employees were sheltered from punishment. Employees told Isaac that senior leadership at the company was notified of the incidents—in some instances, employees even directly contacted C.T.O. Thuan Pham and C.E.O. Travis Kalanick to let them know about workplace harassment. But employees say that a culture of exceptionalism kept an “A-Team” of senior management close to Kalanick from being scrutinized by Uber’s human-resources department. (Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement given to the Times , Chief Human Resources Officer Liane Hornsey said, “We are totally committed to healing wounds of the past and building a better workplace culture for everyone.”) Earlier this week, Kalanick told the Hive that he had been unaware of Fowler’s experience and was appalled to read about it. Since then, Uber has brought on former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder —who previously helped Airbnb work through claims of racial discrimination by users on its platform—to conduct an investigation into Fowler’s allegations. Uber board member Arianna Huffington and Uber’s head of human resources Liane Hornsey will also be part of the internal investigation, although it’s unclear what effect the investigation will have. If the problems at Uber are as systemic and widespread as employees suggest, Uber may have to hold itself to a higher standard and, as Kalanick has promised to do , rid itself of the bad actors within the company. Uber, which is valued at $68 billion and operates in some 70 countries around the world, is not alone in facing charges of sexism in Silicon Valley, where the vast majority of tech workers are men. Kleiner Perkins, Google, GitHub, Facebook, and Apple have all dealt with similar accusations by female employees, suggesting that bias and discrimination are an industry-wide problem. With each allegation that blows up in the press, the Valley gets a little bit better at dealing seriously with what is a deeply-rooted, insidious issue. Still, it is troubling how many tech companies only take action after the fact, when evidence of mismanagement had been available all along. While a number of Uber employees were reportedly shocked by Fowler’s essays, others said they identified with her story during an hour-and-a-half-long all-hands meeting on Tuesday , as employees peppered senior management with questions. “What I can promise you is that I will get better every day,” Kalanick said during the meeting, according to the Times . “I can tell you that I am authentically and fully dedicated to getting to the bottom of this.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:37:30.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
