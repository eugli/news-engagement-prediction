Photo: Michael Bryant/AP As many as 100 headstones were knocked over at a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia overnight Saturday in what may have been an anti-Semitic hate crime. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that some 75-100 headstones were found lying on the ground at the Mount Carmel Cemetery in the city’s Wissinoming area on Sunday morning, and that there is no evidence of similar damage at the three apparently Christian cemeteries which are adjacent to Mount Carmel.\n“This is beyond vandalism,” one police captain told the Inquirer after surveying the damage. No arrests have been made, and police do not appear to have identified any suspects. A GoFundMe account has been launched to solicit donations to help repair the damage, and that effort was already underway on Sunday:\nGroup of people of numerous faiths working to reset tombstones at Jewish cemetery. Hundreds knocked over. @6abc pic.twitter.com/cwJHmmFwv4\n— Bob Brooks (@BobBrooks6abc) February 26, 2017 The Anti-Defamation League and the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect have spoken out against the crime, which they link to an escalating series of anti-Semitic incidents throughout the country over the past few months. Just last week, 154 headstones were found knocked over at a Jewish cemetery in a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. Police say they haven’t found any evidence to suggest that vandalism was a hate crime, but they haven’t ruled it out either.\nVice-President Mike Pence visited the Missouri cemetery last Wednesday to condemn the crime and anti-Semitism more broadly, and that followed President Trump breaking his much-criticized silence on the issue the day before.\nTags: anti-semitism philadelphia hate crimes Nearly 100 Headstones Toppled at Jewish Cemetery in Philly Top Stories Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on How Mattis Can Stand Up to Trump Trump’s Rollback on Transgender Bathroom Rule Is Just the Beginning Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party Most Viewed Stories White House Staffers Leak News of Sean Spicer’s ‘Phone Check’ Targeting Their Leaks ‘Defamed’ Meryl Streep Slams Karl Lagerfeld Over Oscars Dress Controversy; Lagerfeld Issues Apology This Obscure News Story, Which Should Be Huge, Shows How Trump Gets Away With Corruption Bill Paxton Dead at 61 Meryl Streep Issues Scathing Response to Karl Lagerfeld’s Oscar Dress Comments [UPDATED] Neil Fingleton, Game of Thrones ’ Mag the Mighty, Dead at 36 How Christian Siriano Is Changing the Red Carpet Natalie Portman Skipping Oscars Due to Pregnancy Nocturnal Animals Has Two Endings, and Both of Them Are Killer Everyone Realized All at Once That Was Mel Gibson’s Girlfriend, Not His Daughter Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer The Wildest Moments From Donald Trump’s Press Conference Latest News from Daily Intelligencer Yesterday at 11:25 p.m. Trump’s Pick for Navy Secretary Withdraws Philip Bilden said he was unable to resolve potential conflicts of interest from his financial investments.\nYesterday at 9:00 p.m. Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on How Mattis Can Stand Up to Trump Also: Steve Bannon on the National Security Council and the “deep state” rebellion.\nYesterday at 6:15 p.m. As Many As 100 Headstones Vandalized at Jewish Cemetery in Philadelphia It’s the second Jewish cemetery in the U.S. to be vandalized in as many weeks.\nYesterday at 4:18 p.m. Migrants Faced More Than 3,500 Attacks in Germany Last Year: Report Germany’s immigrant population has become the target of a growing number of hate crimes.\nYesterday at 1:43 p.m. White House Staffers Leak News of Spicer’s ‘Phone Check’ Targeting Leaks He made them surrender their electronic devices for a surprise search, then warned them not to tell the press.\n2/25/2017 at 8:25 p.m. Trump’s New National Security Adviser Pans the Term ‘Radical Islamic Terrorism’ H.R.
