Celestial object over California turns out to be Trident missile (VIDEO) \n“Navy Strategic Systems Programs conducted scheduled Trident II (D5) missile test flights at sea from an Ohio Class SSBN, in the Pacific Test Range off the coast of California,” the Navy said in an issued statement. \nWhile the Trident missiles were launched at 3:30am and 6:20am, Navy spokesman John Daniels pointed out to local news stations that the mysterious spectacle was most likely produced by stage one of the launch which lasts about a minute, and possibly part of stage two.

At no time did the missiles fly over land,” the Navy statement said. “All missiles are tracked from multiple sources from launch until final impact in the ocean. The missiles were not armed.” Just saw UFO flying west of #ChicoCa Bright light followed by long tail. It rotated, went north before out of sight.

Trident D5 is a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), built by Lockheed Martin Space Systems for the American and British navies. It serves as the primary seaborne nuclear deterrent. \nREAD MORE: Trident nuclear missiles have history of failure, US documents show \nThe missiles are carried by 14 US Ohio and 4 British Vanguard-class submarines.
