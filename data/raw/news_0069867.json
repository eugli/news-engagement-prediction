And the fact that this president, a man of action and impact is actually keeping his promises at very fast clip early in his administration,” Conway said on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends” Thursday morning. It was her second TV appearance in as many days after several days off-camera.\n \nRepublican members of the House and Senate have held bruising town-hall meetings in their districts over the past few weeks, facing rooms full of angry constituents with an array of complaints about the GOP agenda under President Donald Trump ranging from healthcare to immigration to congressional oversight of the White House. \nSome in the Republican Party have said that the crowds filling GOP town halls are paid protesters, a trend White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said earlier this month was not a liberal grassroots uprising but instead an “Astroturf-type movement.”\nThursday morning, Conway said the outbursts of frustration at Republican town halls is an extension of the Democrats’ failed 2016 presidential campaign. Just like Hillary Clinton, Conway said, Democrats have little in the way of solutions and are turning instead to attacks against Trump. The Democratic Party is “the party of no,” she said, tagging it with a label that Democrats have long sought to pin on the GOP.\n“You know, the Democratic National Committee has been without a permanent chair for seven months. The opposition party is exactly that these days. They belly ache and moan and complain about most things,” she said. “I haven't heard any solutions. It's just like Hillary Clinton in the campaign. What was her message, let alone her positive message? Donald Trump ad, I'm not Donald Trump. That's not a message. That’s a screed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:19:04.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
