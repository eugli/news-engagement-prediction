Following BJP Member of Parliament (MP) Yogi Adityanath’s remarks on the lack of power supply in UP, Akhilesh Yadav stated that the BJP MP who dons safron robes can touch an electric wire and check whether there is power or not.\nAddressing an election rally in Gorakhpur, from which Yogi Adityanath is a BJP MP, Akhilesh said, “There is a ‘baba’ in the neighbourhood who has raised questions on power supply…I will only say that ‘babaji’ you can touch an electric wire and see whether there is power or not.”\nFurther slamming Yogi Adityanath, the SP leader targetted the BJP MP over the safron parties earlier remarks on ‘Kabristan’ and ‘samshanghats’. Joined by Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi at the rally, Akhilesh claimed that every house in Gorakhpur has a Samajwadi Party laptop and if elected to form government again, SP will be distributing smartphones also.\nAlso Watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:31:50.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
