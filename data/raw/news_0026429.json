The first holdalls were discovered on Thursday afternoon and more were found nearby on Friday. \nIn all, around 360 kg of cocaine has been washed ashore in what the NCA called “a major blow to the organized criminals involved.” \n“We are now ... trying to establish how the bags ended up where they did,” said Matthew Rivers, from the NCA’s border investigation team. “It is extremely unlikely that this was their intended destination.” \nPolice Superintendent Dave Buckley said he believed all the packages had now been recovered but appealed for anyone finding more to contact police immediately. \n“We will have extra officers in the area to monitor the situation,” he cautioned. \n(Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison) Related Coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T13:16:27.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
