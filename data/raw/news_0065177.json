In the first six months of 2016, there were 32,117 apprehensions of family members compared to 13,913 apprehensions in that same time period in 2015. The surge in family apprehensions were attributed to people from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras fleeing violence and poverty. \nKelly also spoke at a Guatemalan Air Force base event where he greeted 347 deportees who arrived via a U.S. flight. \n“If you’re a Guatemalan who is considering paying a great deal of money to a coyote (smuggler) to bring you to the United States, you’ll be wasting your money,” Kelly said . \nThe secretary said his comments were aimed at the “wonderful people of Guatemala who are considering making the decision to move north across the very, very dangerous route through Mexico to the United states.” \nDuring his visit to Guatemala, Kelly said there would be no massive deportations but warned that recent changes by the President Donald Trump’s administration will allow immigration officials to deport those apprehended much quicker than in the last decade. \n“My advice is to not take the risk with your own life or your precious children to make this very very dangerous journey,” Kelly said.
