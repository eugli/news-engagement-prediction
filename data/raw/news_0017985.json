Source: News Corp Australia \nThe event was already struggling with sluggish ticket sales before the Bureau of Meteorology started painting a scary picture for Brisbane this weekend.\nThe east coast heatwave simply put the final nail in the coffin, but it’s a cop out to blame the concept’s poor showing on the forecasts of 36C temperatures in Brisbane.\nMost teams have sent weak squads to the tournament, holding back their stars for the Super Rugby season.\nNone of the All Blacks players were cleared to compete. Even French club Toulon left most of its stars, including Ma’a Nonu, back home.\nIt is now embarrassingly obvious why, before the event had ever been staged, there were reports the Rugby Tens will not remain in Brisbane next year.\nAccording to The Courier-Mail, Suncorp Stadium may instead host the Rugby League Nines next season in a straight swap with Auckland for the Rugby Tens.\nSo hot @suncorpstadium #10'sRugby pic.twitter.com/T4v3Vt6ltT \n— Titilia Nabuta (@T_Tee25) February 11, 2017 NRL boss Todd Greenberg has already said the Australian Rugby League Commission is exploring the idea of moving the nines to Brisbane in 2019.\nAn estimated crowd of just 22,000 attended the Auckland Nines this year, after the concept initially attracted sell-out crowds at Auckland’s 50,000 Eden Park.\nDuco Events, which created the Nines concept, brokered a five-year agreement with the NRL which expires following next year’s event.\n#rugby #Toulon #Brisbaneglobalten arrived at Suncorp stadium, waiting for Toulon's play at 5pm pic.twitter.com/gKbhOsfxfS \n— sevkrikorian (@skriko83) February 11, 2017 Unlike, its rugby league big brother event, the Rugby Tens is not a unique concept.\nWhere rugby league has thrived in a gala day format with players given additional space to play razzle dazzle football, the rugby tens’ concept simply comes across as a clunkier, more congested and less meaningful version of rugby sevens.\nWith sevens rugby expanding its foothold around the world in recent years with a boost from its inclusion in the 2016 Rio Olympics, rugby tens is just the equivalent of Thirty30 cricket.\nOn paper, the format never looked like working. In execution, it hasn’t.\n#GlobalTens @SuncorpStadium #Yearofsport @thepyeman pic.twitter.com/xC5ElC2XA9 \n— Early Thoughts (@earlythoughts) February 11, 2017 It does not pass the smell test.\nUnlike the Sevens World Series, the idea of one weekend of club based, 10-man rugby, does not stand up on its own as a legitimate sporting event.\nThe lack of interest from players clearly shows the weekend is nothing but a poor attempt at revenue raising.\nWallaby winger Drew Mitchell conceded last week the concept has no future.\nMitchell said there is no space for the event on the international rugby calendar with the Super Rugby season kicking off on February 23.\nIt was hot for everyone. Source: News Corp Australia \n“There’s just not enough time, there’s too much footy already as it is,” Mitchell said.\n“People aren’t sending full-strength squads.\n“I don’t think there’s room for a permanent thing,\n“I think a one-off like this is exciting, but I don’t think there’s enough room in the year to keep adding things in.\n“Then you’re going to start getting injuries from players and not being able to back up for Tests because of the workloads are getting too much.\n“But I guess money drives everything.”\nWhen the ultimate prise of winning the entire tournament means absolutely nothing to every athlete involved, every player is turned into a mercenary showcasing their skills for a quick pay day.\nAt least in rugby sevens, teams are representing their country.\nUnder the club-based Rugby Tens concept, players, as proud as they are as professional athletes, are asked to embrace a concept that is completely foreign to our shores.\nAt least in Rugby Nines, the concept in its infancy was partly sold around the idea of NRL clubs winning a fairly handsome pay day alongside the money that went to the players.\nThe following of Super Rugby franchises in Australia is also — obviously — smaller in memberships and fans than NRL clubs, further reducing the interest in this weekend’s festivities.\nYou can not be as late to the party as the Brisbane Rugby Tens were while offering an inferior product and expect to be automatically embraced because of Australia’s thirst for sport.\nSimply put, this was the first and hopefully last time we will have to endure this shoddy sports offering.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:09:22.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
