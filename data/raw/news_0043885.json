Tickets are available on resale. Orlando City's 2017 season opener in the new downtown stadium March 5 against NYCFC is sold out. Tickets are available on resale. (Courtesy of Orlando City SC) Alicia DelGallo ’s 2017 season opener March 5 against New York City FC is sold out, the club announced shortly after single-game tickets went on sale Tuesday. \nTickets to the game are available on resale through TicketExchange, the only site verified by Orlando City, and other third-party websites. \nSingle-game tickets to the LA Galaxy match April 15 also sold out within minutes, but an allotment of tickets to that game are included in five-game packages still available. \nThe opening-game sellout was expected as limited tickets went on sale to the public. Season ticket holders accounted for 18,000 of the 25,500 seats in the new downtown stadium, while five-game ticket packages, group sales and other presale options filled the majority of the remaining seats prior to Tuesday. \nDemand for the tickets is high as the Lions drew an announced crowd of more than 60,000 people to their 2015 and 2016 season openers. \n“The buzz has been fantastic,” said Chris Gallagher, Orlando City’s vice president of ticket sales. “The fact two games are sold out and others are getting close...we really expect all the games to be sold out at some point this year.” \nFace value for tickets to the opener ranged in price from $35 to $190, according to Gallagher. Tickets available via resale now range in price from $85 for a spot in the supporters section to $2,000 for club-level seats that include food and beverage. \n“That $2,000 listing is just someone who I think is hopeful someone will bite at that price,” Gallagher said. “That’s been up there for weeks.” \nThis is a developing story.
