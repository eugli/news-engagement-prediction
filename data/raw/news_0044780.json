Previous articles looked at Italy and France . 1. Tortilla de patatas (potato omelette) \nWhat makes it great \nEggs, potatoes, olive oil, onions… that’s it – and some purists even consider that adding onion is a gastronomic crime of the highest order. The Spanish omelette is so much more than the sum of its parts. \nWhere to try it \nOne of my favourites is at Bar Néstor ( barnestor.com ) in San Sebastián . They only make one at lunchtime and another one in the evening, which are served to around 16 lucky customers. San Sebastián 2. Paella Valenciana \nWhat makes it great \nIn the Valencia region they claim you can eat a different rice dish every day of the year, but let’s stick with the most traditional version for now. Ingredients for paella valenciana include chicken or rabbit, saffron, runner beans and butter beans. The all-important element is the rice, ideally the bomba or calasaparra varieties grown on Spain’s east coast, which are particularly good for absorbing all the flavours. \nWhere to try it \nCasa Salvador ( casasalvador.com ) in the Albufera wetlands south of Valencia , where the rice is grown, has been cooking superb paellas for more than 60 years. 3. Gazpacho \nWhat makes it great \nThere is always a jug of chilled gazpacho on the counter in tapas bars in Andalucia in summer. The ripest tomatoes are blended with olive oil, garlic, bread, peppers and cucumber until silky smooth. So simple, so refreshing. \nWhere to try it \nEslava ( espacioesplava.com ) in Seville makes a terrific gazpacho with vegetables from their organic garden. Seville Credit: sorincolac - Fotolia 4. Cochinillo (roast suckling pig) \nWhat makes it great \nThroughout the region of Castilla-León, cochinillo is cooked in huge wood-fired ovens and is so tender that is can be carved with the side of an earthenware plate. \nWhere to try it \nPeople might claim they are going to Segovia to see its astounding Roman aqueduct, fairytale castle or elegant cathedral, but all that is just to build up an appetite for lunch, probably at the Mesón de Cándido ( mesondecandido.es ).

Croquetas (croquettes) \nWhat makes it great \nSquidgy croquetas are made with a thick béchamel flavoured with ham, chicken, cod, spinach… to name just a few varieties. Everyone claims their mother’s recipe is the best and you can’t argue with that. \"Everyone claims their mother’s recipe is the best\" Credit: chandlervid85 - Fotolia \nWhere to try it \nChef Francis Paniego has two Michelin stars at El Portal de Echaurren ( echaurren.com ) in Ezcaray in La Rioja, but his more traditional restaurant and tapas bar are just as prestigious really and the croquetas - the recipe is his mother Marisa’s, who is also a renowned chef - have a lot to do with that. There is a chic hotel too, just in case you don’t feel like moving afterwards. 6. Almadraba bluefin tuna \nWhat makes it great \nTuna is caught off the coast of Cádiz province in late spring, when the fish swim across the Atlantic to the Mediterranean to reproduce, and is prized for its exquisite taste and texture: the belly is marbled like the best ibérico ham. The labyrinthine trap system known as the almadraba has been used since the Phoenicians settled there 3,000 years ago and is now recognised as a sustainable fishing method. Head to Cádiz province for the best tuna in Spain Credit: Kiko Jimenez \nWhere to try it \nEl Campero ( restauranteelcampero.es ) in Barbate on the Costa de la Luz is the undisputed tuna temple of Spain. Their almadraba tasting menu takes you from marinated loin to sashimi, tataki and tartare. 7. Rabo de Toro Estofado (braised oxtail) \nWhat makes it great \nThis most traditional of Spanish dishes should ideally be made with bull’s tail, which is slow-cooked in red wine until deliciously tender and rich. \nWhere to try it \nCordoba, Madrid and Pamplona are among the best cities to eat rabo de toro. At the Europa restaurant ( hreuropa.com ) in Pamplona it is served off the bone with parsnip purée. 8. Fabada Asturiana (Asturian bean stew) \nWhat makes it great \nSilky butter beans are cooked with slab bacon, pork shoulder and chorizo and morcilla sausages to create a flavourful stew that will set you up for a hike in the mountains in this very pretty region – or maybe for a long nap. It goes dangerously well with the local cider. Fabada Asturiana Credit: javitouh - Fotolia \nWhere to try it \nTraditional cider houses and village restaurants in Asturias will always have a cauldron of fabada on the go, but the best I have had is at the Michelin-starred Casa Gerardo ( restaurantecasagerardo.es ) in the countryside near Gijón, where Marcos Morán and his father Pedro have created a lighter, delicate version from the family recipe that has been evolving since the restaurant opened in 1882. 9. Pulpo a Feira \nWhat makes it great \nThe best octopus in Spain is from the Atlantic around the coast of Galicia. Simply boiled and sprinkled with olive oil, sea salt and pimentón (Spanish paprika), it is served on wooden plates, often with chunks of potato and always with a cold beer or Galician white wine. \nWhere to try it \nFor perfectly-cooked pulpo, head to the Pulpeira de Melide ( pulpeirademelida.com ) in La Coruña.

Gambas al ajillo (garlic prawns) \nWhat makes it great \nYou walk into a tapas bar and the barman is handing a customer an earthenware dish of prawns sizzling away in olive oil pepped up with garlic and chilli. The tantalising aroma hits your nostrils and you just have to order some too. There is no point in trying to resist. You know you want to Credit: mariontxa - Fotolia \nWhere to try it \nYou’ll find this little dish of happiness all over Spain but if you are in Madrid, La Casa del Abuelo ( lacasadelabuelo.es ), which has been open for more than a century, is a pretty good place to start.
