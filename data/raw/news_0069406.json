Rand Paul (Ky.) ripped fellow Republican Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) on Sunday after McCain criticized President Trump’s escalating war of words with the media. \n\nHe argued that the nation is “very lucky” that Trump is president and not McCain, who won the 2008 GOP nomination but lost to Barack Obama in the general election. \n\nPaul said that McCain’s recent criticisms of Trump are driven by his “personal dispute” with the president over foreign policy. \n\nHe added that McCain and Trump are at odds because McCain supports the wide deployment of U.S. troops to protect and promote American interests abroad while he characterized Trump’s views as closer to a realpolitik approach to foreign policy. \n\n“Everything that he says about the president is colored by his own personal dispute he’s got running with President Trump, and it should be taken with a grain of salt, because John McCain’s the guy who’s advocated for war everywhere,” Paul said on ABC’s “This Week.” \n\n“He would bankrupt the nation. We’re very lucky John McCain’s not in charge, because I think we’d be in perpetual war,” Paul added. \n\nPaul argued that McCain has a history of being wrong major foreign policy questions. \n\n“I would say John McCain’s been wrong on just about everything over the last four decades. He advocated for the Iraq War, which I think destabilized the Middle East,” he said. \n\n“If you look at the map, there’s probably at least six different countries where John McCain has advocated for us having boots on the ground,” he added. \nFinally, someone in the party is standing up to McCain’s perpetual warmongering! . @RandPaul : On foreign policy, Sen.
