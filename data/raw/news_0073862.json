The 89th Academy Awards wasn't all that different , really. Dev Patel killed it in a white jacket and black trousers while everyone from Justin Timberlake to Andrew Garfield stuck to classic black tuxedos. And then, surprise! —a couple of guys wore blue. \nA few attendees did complete their outfits with something a little more statement making than the typical bow-tie, however. Accessories that had a political message popped up in a few places. Here are a few that caught our eye—and the deeper meaning behind each of them. Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Blue Ribbon \nRuth Negga, Karlie Kloss, and Hamilton 's Lin-Manuel Miranda were among the stars who wore a blue ribbon tonight as part of the American Civil Liberties Union's \"Stand with ACLU\" initiative. The organization's efforts in fighting against the recent immigration ban have inspired a massive surge in new members. \nCasey Affleck also wore the ribbon at the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday, along with a shirt that spelled out \"Love\" in Arabic . Tarell Alvin McCraney’s Red Ribbon \nMcCraney, who wrote the source material for Moonlight , wore a red ribbon tonight to show support for those living with HIV/AIDs. McCraney’s mother, a heavy drug user, died of AIDs-related complications when he was just beginning to build his career as a playwright at the age of 23. Brad Goreski’s Ampersand Pin \nE!'s Brad Goreski didn’t stop with aviator glasses when it came to statement-making accessories, adding a GLAAD pin to his lapel. The pin is meant to show solidarity with all marginalized groups, including the gay and lesbian communities. The cast of Moonlight also wore the pins at the Independent Spirit Awards. Pharrell Williams’ Women’s Necklace \nEven if making a political statement wasn’t Pharrell’s primary objective here, the move still sent a message about gender that feels relevant right now. The debate over transgender rights is one of the core issues dividing Americans right now, so a man showing up to the Oscars in a Chanel pearl necklace—the kind typically reserved for “ladies who lunch”—can’t mean nothing.
