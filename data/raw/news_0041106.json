The owner of the Vehicle reported it stolen in Dandora. \nAccording to Kayole police, master keys, a walkie-talkie, a pair of number plates and a pistol with six rounds were found in the car. \nCounty police boss Japhet Koome said the men had been on police radar for a while. \nLYNCHED \nIn Shauri Moyo, a man said to be part of a gang that has been robbing residents, was killed on Tuesday evening while in Mowlem, two suspected robbers were shot dead. \nPolice said they found a pistol with stolen household items from the men. The bodies were taken to the City Mortuary. \nIn Eldoret, residents of West Indies Estate flushed out two robbery suspects from their house on Wednesday morning and killed them. \nThe killing of the pair brought to 10 the number of people in the area who have suffered the same fate in the last five months. \nThe two were believed to be members of a gang that has been breaking into homes and mugging owners. Police officers later took the bodies to Moi public hospital mortuary. \nRISING INSECURITY \nThe residents accused police of doing little to stem rising insecurity. \n“We no longer sleep for fear of being attacked. Our pleas to authorities are falling on deaf ears,” Mr Bernard Kipkosgei said. \nJust days ago, two suspected thieves were killed by a mob in the area. And before that, another four had been lynched at Roadblock and Kipkorgot areas. \nUasin Gishu County Commissioner Abdi Hassan admitted crime was on the rise in parts of Eldoret but said it was under control. \n“Police have intensified patrols in major estates. We have received complaints of residents being terrorised but the criminals should know their days are numbered,” he said. \nResidents also accuse boda bodas of colluding with criminals. Governor Jackson Mandago has ordered the vetting of boda boda riders.
