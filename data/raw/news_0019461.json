Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA pooch who was brutally beaten up by his pregnant owner is now a ‘beautiful, friendly dog’ who is getting ready to be rehomed. \nLennox, who is currently in the care of the RSPCA , is reserved for adoption after suffering at the hand’s of his previous owner. \nThe dog is now safely away from Jamie-Leigh Williams, who pleaded guilty on Wednesday, after she was caught on camera kicking and hitting the animal in her Oldham home . Jamie-Leigh Williams \nThe footage, which was posted on Facebook back by a former lodger in November, shows the 20-year-old with her back to the camera kick Lennox multiple times as he is trapped against the front door. \nShe then punches him twice. Williams is then filmed repeatedly hitting him in the kitchen and smacking him in the face.

Lennox has been described as 'beautiful and friendly' and is doing well after video footage emerged of him being brutally beaten \n“We didn’t know where he was and of course were extremely concerned for his welfare after what we’d seen, but by the afternoon, thanks to our tenacious staff and the help of the public and police, we had found him and Williams had signed him over to us. We’re really grateful to everyone who got in touch. \n“At no point during what’s happening to him does Lennox show any aggression towards Williams, he’s crying out and trying to get away. It’s shocking footage. It’s really horrible to watch.” \nWhen Lennox was checked over by vets, he was luckily found to be uninjured.
