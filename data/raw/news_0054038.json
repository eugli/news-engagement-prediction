Comment on This Story Vernon Bryant/Staff Photographer Texas' Tyrone Swoopes sprints down the field as High Performance Coordinator Brian Abadie observes him during MJP Media Day at Michael Johnson Performance in McKinney on Wednesday, February 22, 2017. Numerous athletes prepare for pro day and the upcoming NFL Combine. (Vernon Bryant/The Dallas Morning News) By Ben Baby , Staff Writer Contact Ben Baby on Twitter: @Ben_Baby \nMcKINNEY -- Former Houston quarterback Greg Ward Jr. and ex-Texas quarterback Tyrone Swoopes took their turns on Wednesday morning kicking up rubber pellets with fresh cleats in pursuit of adapting to the next change in their lives. \nInside the Michael Johnson Performance center and with a handful of media members watching, the former quarterbacks took turns working through drills. \nEach man spent the last couple of years proving himself. Now, Swoopes and Ward look to do that again. Only this time, they won't be throwing any passes. \nAs April's NFL Draft approaches, both players are working on position changes. Ward is considering a move to inside receiver, while Swoopes could move to receiver or tight end.

(Vernon Bryant/The Dallas Morning News) \nThe switch could be as simple as a pitch-and-catch. \n\"You don't need to be an elite athlete to play the position (receiver),\" said Dane Brugler, a senior draft analyst for CBS Sports. \"You just have to understand the mechanics of it to not only get open but then catch the ball and be productive.\" \nBut a little extra athleticism never hurts. And it aided both players' experiences as college quarterbacks. \nWard left Tyler John Tyler without a set college position. After beginning his career as a wide receiver and kick returner, he ended up starting 33 games at quarterback for the Cougars. Houston won 27 of those contests. \nSwoopes, on the other hand, came to Austin as a highly-touted passing prospect from small-town Whitewright. He lost the starting job in 2014 but ended up excelling in what Texas called its \"18-wheeler\" formation. Swoopes powered his 6-foot-4, 249-pound frame to run for 174 yards and seven touchdowns. \nBoth players are among the more than 20 recent college players with NFL aspirations currently training in McKinney. While Swoopes and Ward work on skills like route-running and scalpel-like cuts, they aren't letting their previous experience go to waste. \n\"They've seen a million routes of everything because they've had to throw those patterns,\" said Brian Abadie, MJP's high-performance coordinator. \"They know where the ball's supposed to be because they've thrown that ball.\" \nWard, who played receiver at both high school and college levels, said the change to inside receiver isn't a big transition. But he knows he must be more than just fast to pull it off - though the 5-foot-10, 174-pound athlete has excelled at that over the years.

(Vernon Bryant/The Dallas Morning News) \n\"You have to be a great route runner,\" Ward said. \"You just can't be fast and that's it. You have to be fast, run routes. You have to be physical. You have to have great feet.\" \nSwoopes said when he first started his offseason workouts, he was moving as fast as he could without much technique. Now, he's focused on improving routes and becoming a better blocker. \n\"Of course I'm a physical guy,\" Swoopes said. \"But I'm just not used to actually getting my hands on people and trying to move them in a certain direction.\" \nDuring their Wednesday morning workouts, Swoopes and Ward worked on moves like their broad jump and sprint drills at the Michael Johnson Performance center. Later in the morning, the facility's namesake and former U.S. track Olympic gold medalist gave another prospect tips on avoiding drag during sprints while Celina football coach Bill Elliott watched and former women's tennis No. 1 Victoria Azarenka trained on the side.

(Vernon Bryant/The Dallas Morning News) \nJohnson, a Skyline grad, said the facility's staff understands how vital the time before the draft is for prospects looking to either improve draft stock or hopes of finding a spot on one of 32 NFL rosters during the summer. \n\"This is a high-pressure time for them,\" Johnson said. \"It's one of the most important things they're ever going to go through in terms of their career as a football player.\" Vernon Bryant/Staff Photographer University of Houston's Greg Ward Jr. listens as Michael Johnson talks to the group at Michael Johnson Performance in McKinney on Wednesday, February 22, 2017.

(Vernon Bryant/The Dallas Morning News) \nWard's next step is next week's draft combine in Indianapolis, while Swoopes will soon head to Austin to prep for the Longhorns' pro day on March 28. Abadie said Swoopes and Ward appeared relaxed while training for their new positions even amidst uncertainty about the future. \nThe trainer attributed the calm to the players no longer carrying the stress of the quarterback position. It is no longer their burden to bear. \n\"I think you've seen almost a relief for both guys, a mental relief,\" Abadie said. \"They feel comfortable at these positions, now knowing the pressure is on somebody else's back to play QB.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:28:35.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
