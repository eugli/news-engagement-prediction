(David Horemans/CBC)\nNext week, a report will go before council outlining a number of recommendations to help curb the problem, including raising the permit rate 400 per cent, from $72 per year to $360 per year for people wanting to buy a permit for the first time. Those with existing permits will only see small increases.\n\"By charging a market rate for permits, more people will choose to park in their buildings,\" the report says.\n\"This will free up street space for people who need it, making parking easier and reducing traffic caused by driving in circles looking for parking.\"\nCity staff had originally proposed raising the permit rate to $600 per year but scaled back the amount after a period of public consultation last year.\nThe study points out that there is 1.5 parking spaces for every West End car but residents with an underground spot will often park on the street out of convenience.\nThe revised recommendations also propose dividing the West End permit area into three smaller zones which it claims will help residents find a space closer to where they live, and updating zoning and bylaws to allow buildings with excess parking to rent it out to other locals.\nA city spokesperson told CBC News \"the changes are not intended to increase revenue for the city, but are intended to make parking easier in the West End.\"", "external_links": ["http://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/west-end-parking-strategy.aspx#recommendations"], "published": "2017-02-01T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:03:53.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
