He rejected a criminal revision petition of a person who had drawn nearly Rs 10 lakh from a national bank by forging a DD in 1996. \n\n“Even though it is contended that the prosecution has not established conspiracy with cogent evidence, yet the ingredients of conspiracy are writ large in the transaction proved by the prosecution...There is absolutely no merit in the revision petition,“ he said in his order, with the same clarity that characterised his September 27, 2014 judgement convicting the then Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa along with Sasikala, VN Sudhakaran and Elavarasi for assets disproportionate to their known sources of income. \n\nJustice D'Cunha, who has about four years to go for retirement, is currently hearing bail and criminal petitions. On December 22, 2016 he gave bail to Kannada film Mastigudi producer and financier Sundar P Gowda, accused of not providing safety measures to two stunt actors who drowned during shooting. The judge in Rs 1 lakh, but allosisted on surety of ` wed bail as other accused had got it. \n\n“He is a judge very thorough on procedures and never interferes unless he is supposed to. Lawyers, including me, are finding it very tough to get favourable judgements from him ­ he goes purely on the merits of the case,“ said senior advocate BT Venkatesh. \n\nVenkatesh said Justice D'Cunha faced tremendous pressure over the Jayalalithaa case, similar to what he had to go through while declining to quash rioting charges against then Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti in the Hub li Idgah Maidan case in 2004. \n\n“Rarely do we come across judges who can bear such pressure. The Jayalalithaa case was very intimidating for a sessions judge. He held his ground and never got distressed or disturbed during the whole proceeding. He has given an amazing judgement with absolute clarity in thought. The kind of appreciation Supreme Court has given for the work he has done is richly deserved,“ he explained. \n\nJustice D'Cunha even wrote the last 300 of the 1,136-page Jayalalithaa-Sasikala judgement himself. \n\nAdvocate Joshua Samuel, who was Justice D'Cunha's junior in the Sri Dharmasthala Manjunatheshwara Law College in Mangaluru, said: “...because of him, the political class knows the judiciary is still strong in this country and courts will always uphold the rule of law irrespective of who you are.“ Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:15:19.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
