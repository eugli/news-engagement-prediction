He is averaging 18.6 points per game and shooting 38.6 percent from 3-point range this season. He could be a valuable addition come playoff time but will need to be surrounded by plus defenders on the floor as he struggles on the defensive end. \nFor the Lakers, they grab a late first-round pick and a decent role player in Brewer as they plan to continue building through the draft. \nThumbnail photo via Tom Szczerbowski/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:32:04.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
