'Ensure public safety' \n\"Following the revocation of the S5 Licence by the Home Office, we are seizing the weapons subject to the revocation to maintain their security and ensure public safety,\" he said. \nPolice said the operation would take a number of days to complete. \nNo arrests have been made. \nWeapons covered by the S5 license include those not typically permitted for civilian use, such as automatic firearms, hand guns, missiles, rockets and noxious gases. \nSkydock is a facility which offers ballistic testing, pyrotechnics development, high security and bomb-proof storage. \nStanding within a 1,000-acre site, it has a 250m steel and concrete firing range, outdoor testing areas and indoor testing laboratories. \nAccording to its website, special effects TV and film crews frequently use the facilities to film specialist projects. \nIt was at the site that arms dealer Gary Hyde was found to be storing thousands of AK-47s when he was jailed for supplying guns to Nigeria without a licence in 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:24:41.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
