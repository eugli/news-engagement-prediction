Trump production — except for this: The secret held.\nWhen President Trump strode down the red-carpeted hallway of the White House to take the lectern beneath the crystal chandeliers of the East Room and face a bank of live cameras — in primetime, at 8:02 p.m. sharp — his viewers did not know for certain which of the finalists might step forward to claim a lifetime seat on the nation’s highest court.\nIt was Judge Neil Gorsuch who did so, walking from a side room with his wife, Louise, to join the president at center stage.\n“So was it a surprise?” Trump asked in his remarks.\nIt was.\nPresident Trump, right, shakes the hand of Judge Neil Gorsuch during a Supreme Court nominee announcement in the East Room at the White House on Tuesday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) And that counted as a major feat for an administration already becoming known for its leaks. Trump’s pick of Mike Pence as vice president leaked out in news reports prematurely. So did almost all of his Cabinet selections. Many of the executive orders Trump has signed leaked out ahead of time.\nBut not his Supreme Court pick.\n“I thought, with this president there was a decent chance that it would be somebody that we didn’t have any idea it was going to be — and tonight’s ‘Apprentice’-style delivery moment might have had an evening gown competition and a swim suit edition,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said.\nOf course, Gorsuch had been widely reported as one of Trump’s finalists, and he was on a list of 21 judges Trump released during last year’s campaign as his potential nominees.\nTrump considered six finalists, all federal judges, to fill the vacancy left by the late justice Antonin Scalia: Gorsuch, Thomas Hardiman, William H. Pryor Jr., Diane S. Sykes, Amul R. Thapar and Don R. Willett, according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer.\nOf those six, Trump personally interviewed four: Grouch, Hardiman, Pryor and Thapar. The first three met with Trump in his personal residence at Trump Tower in New York on Jan. 14, Spicer said.\nIn the interview process, Trump evaluated the finalists in part on which would best emulate Scalia in judicial philosophy and background, his advisers said.\n“He was constantly looking for somebody who reflected Justice Scalia’s love of the Constitution, adherence to law, not making up the law as you go to fit your political whims or your personal interests,” said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president.\nIn recent weeks, Trump began to settle on his choice, but did not make a final decision until Monday, when he called Gorsuch to notify him that he was the pick. White House Counsel Don McGahn informed the other finalists that they had not been selected, Spicer said.\nFrom there, Trump’s aides set into motion a cloak-and-dagger plan they had orchestrated to bring Gorsuch to Washington without him being detected.\nAfter receiving the president’s call, Spicer said, Gorsuch and his wife traveled to a neighbor’s house in Boulder, Colo. They were met by a team of lawyers from the White House Counsel’s Office, who briefed the judge on the announcement plans for Tuesday and helped him prepare for the frenzy that would come.\nThe White House aides ferried Gorsuch down a quiet farm road to the airport, where they boarded a military jet for the flight to Joint Base Andrews, just outside of Washington, Spicer said.\nThe judge and his wife stayed in Washington on Monday night at a private residence before visiting the White House on Tuesday, prior to the announcement.\nAll day Tuesday, speculation was rampant about Trump’s selections. Hardiman had been spotted at a gas station in Pennsylvania, and CNN reported that he along with Gorsuch were being brought to Washington to add suspense ahead Trump’s final selection. Spicer said that only Gorsuch traveled to Washington, noting that Hardiman had been spotted making a pit stop on his way to a meeting in Pennsylvania.\nThen there were the Twitter accounts. Two similar accounts were created identifying both Hardiman and Gorsuch as Trump’s Supreme Court nominees, with links to White House websites. It seemed as if the White House social media team had been behind the accounts — again, to create suspense — but White House officials said that was not the case.\nIn the end, hopes for a reality-show ending — the president holding a rose, calling both men on stage and, to the drumroll of a military band, giving it to one of them — were dashed.\nTrump’s announcement was formal and scripted — presidential, even — as he read from his telepromters:\n“I would like to ask Judge Gorsuch and his wonderful wife, Louise, to please step forward,” Trump said. “Please, Louise, judge. Here they come. Here they come.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:44:39.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
