He was fined $1,880. \nGeorge Keewatin, 32, who is from Kamsack was fined $10,000 after pleading guilty to unlawful guiding. It was his second conviction for unlawfully guiding in 2016. \nBoth Baptiste and Keewatin were also ordered from being in the company of anyone involved in any aspect of hunting in Saskatchewan, unless on First Nations land or in the company of another treaty person hunting for subsistence. \nThey must also provide all details and information of all animals killed while outfitting, ensure their clients go to a Ministry of Environment office and swear affidavits that all the hunting details and information are true, along with signing any required export permits. \nThe conditions have been imposed for a period of five years.
