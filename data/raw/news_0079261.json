After that issue promptly sold out, the Raspberry Pi Zero was offered for sale for just $5. \nHowever, to offer a single board computer for the same price as a coffee didn't come without compromises. The Zero lacked some key features of the more expensive Pi models, including wireless. Today, to help celebrate the Pi's 5th birthday, the Raspberry Pi Foundation is fixing that problem with the introduction of the Raspberry Pi Zero W. \nThe Zero W doubles the price to $10, but in return for the extra cash it includes wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.1. In doing so, it aims to solve the dongle problem. The Pi Zero only includes one USB port and it was being used to attach a dongle so as to plug in all the required peripherals to use the board. The Zero W removes the need for a dongle (and for less than a dongle costs) allowing you to interact wirelessly with the board for most tasks, including Internet access and keyboard and mouse control. \nThe spec of the Pi Zero W is as follows: 1GHz, single-core CPU", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:04:10.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
