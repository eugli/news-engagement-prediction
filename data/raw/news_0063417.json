Draymond Green (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 12:26 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 12:26 a.m. ET \nDraymond Green decided to kick things up a notch Thursday against the Clippers. \nThe Warriors forward was wrestling for a loose ball in the first half of Thursday's game at Staples Center. When Clippers forward Blake Griffin came in to try to rip the ball from Green's hand, Griffin was nearly kicked in the head as Green violently raised his right leg.

Pierce announced last September that the 2016-17 season would be his last. Pierce has played in only 13 games this season and did not play in the first half of Thursday's game. That didn't stop Green from heckling Pierce. \nWhile Griffin was at the free throw line less than a minute into the game, Green shouted at Pierce, who was sitting on the Clippers bench. \n\"You're chasing that farewell tour,\" Green said loud enough to be heard on the TNT broadcast. \"You can't get no farewell tour, they don't love you like that...You thought you was Kobe?\" Draymond just straight-up trashed Paul Pierce. \"You can't get no farewell tour, they don't love you like that...You thought you was Kobe?\" pic.twitter.com/SC0A0vxLTo â€” Sports Illustrated (@SInow) February 24, 2017 \nIt's hard for someone to get the love from the crowd when he's not playing, but damn dude, respect your elders. The man was a 10-time All-Star and led the Celtics to an NBA title in 2008. \nGreen kept it up in the third quarter, getting a technical foul early in the third quarter after running over Griffin. He then started to yell at Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who had pulled him from the game.
