All three asked the victim to remove her jewellery and put them into a bag. All three suspects disappeared soon after,” ACP Megat said. \nThe victim claimed to be ‘under a spell’ during the incident and her losses were estimated at about RM10,000. \nACP Megat said the cheating case was being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating. \nThe suspect, who has been remanded, had no previous criminal record, he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:00:46.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
