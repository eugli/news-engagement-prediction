The Secret Daughter star recalled feeling an overwhelming sense of loneliness, particularly after performing, before she began living with the hunk. 'You go on stage and sing and there's the crowd in front of you and the lights and all the noise and commotion,' she shared. Stronger than ever: Jessica and Themeli often document their blossoming romance by sharing affectionate snaps across social media Fun, games and romance: The Darwin-born beauty met the Northern Territory-based soccer player on a cheeky night out nine years ago 'But then everyone goes home and I was left on my own. It was so quiet. That was really hard … I don't have to worry about that now because 'Them' is here and I can talk to him.' In September, the Darwin-born beauty told WHO magazine that she is open to marrying the former Darwin Council worker. 'I love the idea of having children with Themeli. I love the idea of being married to him. We already kind of are,' she said. Go girl!
