Here are some literary characters we would like to see on our TV screens. A + A - Kritika Kamra stars in Chandrakanta. Picture courtesy: Instagram/kkamra; Instagram/oliviabiba \nChandrakanta, based on Devaki Nandan Khatri's novel, is going to make a return to the small screen in a brand new avatar next month. \nNow, we think that it would be pretty great to see shows based on these five literary characters: \nThe Namesake's Ashima Ganguli Picture courtesy: Instagram/filmreels \nJhumpa Lahiri's popular novel has great characters in it, and one of them is Ashima Ganguli. We picked Ashima because it would be interesting to see a young, sari-clad woman in 1968 America struggle to find her place in a foreign land. \nA woman who has her own language and cultural battles to fight, a woman who is strong, but also afraid. \nAshima would make for really good television. \nUmrao Jan's narrator \nMirza Hadi Ruswa's novel has been translated into movies. But those films, called Umrao Jaan, were about the titular character and her hardships. But anyone who has read the book would know that the novel's narrator is quite a character in himself. \nWho was he actually to Umrao Jan to know her so intimately? Yes, Umrao had shared her story with him when they had met, but what was the narrator really like? Was he as enchanting as Umrao herself that she couldn't help but relate her life's history to him? \nWe would really like to know. \nThe Pregnant King's Yuvanashva Picture courtesy: Instagram/jalebikhan \nA childless king (Yuvanashva) wants a child, and he accidentally ends up drinking a magic potion meant for his queen, as a result of which he gets pregnant. \nNow imagine a show based on this single-line plot. \nLihaaf's Begum Jan Ismat Chughtai. Picture courtesy: Instagram/writers_loverspoets \nLihaaf is writer Ismat Chughtai's most popular and most controversial work. The story revolves around the intriguing protagonist Begum Jan, who has a a sad marriage, and who fills the void in her life by engaging in questionable sexual encounters. \nYuganta's Bhima \nIrawati Karve's retelling of the Indian epic Mahabharata is interesting as well as fascinating. And we all know that the great epic is replete with greater characters, but in Yuganta, the muscular and mighty Bhima stands out. \nWhy? Because Irawati argues in her text that he was the one who truly loved Draupadi. Now just imagine a series exploring this facet of the great Bhima. \nPlease make it happen.
