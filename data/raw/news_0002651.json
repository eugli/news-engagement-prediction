The first half is tediously inert, and it only fitfully gains momentum from then on. \nHere’s the plot: During the reign of an ancient dynasty, a couple of mercenaries (Matt Damon-Pedro Pascal) on the trail of a cache of gunpowder — then a valuable new invention — are captured and held hostage by an elite faction of the Chinese army. As a mercenary and ace archer, Matt Damon displays characteristic agility.The Chilean-born Pedro Pascal, in the role of sidekick, strives to provide comic relief. \nBarricaded behind the Great Wall, they join forces to ward off attacks from thousands of mythical beasts. \nLavish colour-coded costumes, impeccable production design and nifty special effects make it eminently watchable, thanks in part to cinematographers Zhao Xiaoding and Stuart-Dryburg and the New Zealand-based Weta Workshop. \nThere is a particularly poignant interlude involving hundreds of airborne white lanterns released in tribute to a fallen general. \nAs the ace archer, Damon displays characteristic agility. But the rest of the characters are thin. \nThe Chilean-born Pascal, in the role of sidekick, strives to provide comic relief. The Chinese cast members, including Tian Jing in the role of a skydiving commander and teen boy-band member Wang Junkai as the effete emperor, are saddled with superficial parts. \nOverall, The Great Wall may not rank among Zhang Yimou’s emotionally weighty masterworks like To Live (1994) or The Road Home (1999), but as a visual extravaganza it nevertheless merits a viewing. \nWatch the trailer for The Great Wall here tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:35:00.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
