CEN 1 Jessica Valeria, 15, was found brutally beaten with a wooden broomstick through her eye behind a house in Torreon, northern Mexico \nSources close to the investigation told Vanguardia there were indications it could have been a satanic rite – but the Attorney General’s Office denied it was probing that line specifically. \nThree 17-year-olds – two boys and one girl – have been arrested in connection with the horror attack last Satudray in the Loma Real colony. \nA source told Vanguardia: “From the beginning were found indications of what could be a satanic rite as the motive of crime. \n“The victim presented very strong blows mainly in the face and the mortal blow was forceful, with extreme violence. \n“Apparently some marks on the body, in addition to other elements, lead to it was in an act of this type (satanic). \n“But everything is an assumption, that’s why the investigations are carried out. \n“It is an unfortunate case, very unfortunate. \n“It is now thought that even more people are involved in the satanic practices, in addition to the three detainees, regardless of whether or not they participated directly in the crime of Jessica Valeria.” \nIt comes just months after three friends were accused of killing a restaurant worker they were allegedly trying to turn into a vampire during a satanic ceremony in Chihuahua, northern Mexico.
