Of those, about 74 per cent are Yazidi.\nHadji   Hesso  of the Canadian  Yazidi  Association is part of a close-knit network of advocates who keep in regular contact. He says he didn't not hear of any government-sponsored arrivals before the last few days.\nLorne Weiss, of Operation Ezra, a Winnipeg-based organization that privately sponsors Yazidi refugees, was baffled about why those helping Yazidis on the front line were shut out of the federal process.  \"We have no way of knowing where those people are or how they were brought in. It's a mystery to us,\" he said.\nProsecute ISIS fighters for murder, rape, slavery, torture — not just terrorism, expert says 'Broken promise that will cost lives': Critics question government's plan to resettle Yazidi victims of ISIS The government has been tight-lipped on the resettlement steps, and would say only that the  Yazidis  are expected to settle in cities in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario and possibly other provinces. \nThe operation, which began four months ago after MPs unanimously adopted a Conservative motion to bring in  Yazidis , has been kept under tight wraps due to security and privacy issues, according to the government.\nPrior to the government's initiative, most of the small, tight-knit Yazidi population in Canada has been clustered in Winnipeg and London, Ont., with some in the Toronto area as well.\nSmall community Hesso, who's based in Winnipeg, wonders how and why hundreds of Yazidis were brought in without their knowledge, and questioned why the government did not seek the community's resettlement assistance.\n\"We are a small minority, almost everyone knows everyone,\" he said, adding that they want to help, and would actually take pressure off the government.\nHesso, a Yazidi from northern Iraq who lived as a refugee in Syria for a decade before coming to Canada in 2000, welcomed the government's initiative to provide asylum to the vulnerable survivors of ISIS.\n\"That means 1,200 will be in a safe zone, and it will call on other nations to do something,\" he said. \n'Untransparent' process In Toronto, the executive director of an organization running a project to privately sponsor Yazidi refugees was also wondering why so many were left out of the loop, calling the process \"untransparent\" and \"cloak and dagger.\"\nIn an interview on CBC News Network's Power & Politics , Mozuud executive director Geoffrey Clarfield said the community of advocates and activists is plugged-in to the Yazidi-Canadian community, yet no one had heard about the arrivals.\nHe said the secrecy may not be in the best interest of Yazidis in Iraq or Canada.\n\"The understanding of the government is that they're supposed to be integrated into the community so if the community leaders don't know who they are and where they are, it's puzzling,\" he told host Rosemary Barton.\nLiberals use QP to tout Yazidi refugee arrivals 1:05\nAn official in Hussen's office said a key factor in determining where individuals will go once in Canada is whether or not they already have family here.\nThat means multiple communities across Canada are welcoming survivors of ISIS in addition to the larger centres, with one or two people settling in one community while other centres will welcome larger numbers, the official said.​\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith files from Brennan MacDonald", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T02:57:59.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
