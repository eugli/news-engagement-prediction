The American wonderkid will go down in history as one of the greatest players in the history of football, scoring 623 goals in 520 games. Sensational.' \nAh, Football Manager 2008 was a great game, wasn't it? \nWhat happened Freddy? The boy touted to become the next Pele instead once ended up advertising handheld vacuums on Twitter to obviously try and suck up some cash in the process. Banter. \nCheck out our video of Football Manager wonderkids who flopped in real life: \nHere's the picture of Freddy, looking extremely happy with his brand new, top of the range 2-in-1 cordless Vacuum. Jokes aside, this is a very sad picture - what could of been. \nUnsurprisingly at the time Twitter users did not sympathise with the American, who is now 27 and without a club after failing his latest trial with MLS club Portland Timbers. @djdilute Yeah, I heard good things about the hoover too... - Joe Crann (@YesWeCrann) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YesWeCrann/status/667123039163817984\">November 18, 2015</a> @FreddyAdu you didn't need the hashtag mate, we can all tell that the only reason you're anywhere near that Hoover is because of money - Chelsea Dave (@MrDaveCFC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrDaveCFC/status/667121650635309056\">November 18, 2015</a> - Anthony J Terminelli (@anthonyterms) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anthonyterms/status/667122188537868288\">November 18, 2015</a> @FreddyAdu @hamesnotjames @HooverUSA Ahhhh did it suck up your career? - TOM (@FUNKYT0WN49) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FUNKYT0WN49/status/667121724387893248\">November 18, 2015</a> @FreddyAdu Wow man, the 14 year old Freddy would never do this - Ibragod (@RobinXVl) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobinXVl/status/667123247373242369\">November 18, 2015</a> Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T17:48:32.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
