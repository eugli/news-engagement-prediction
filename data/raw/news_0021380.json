He led Raiders to a 7-9 finish in his first season with the team, and broke a 14-year playoff drought by posting a 12-4 record this past season. \nThe resurgent Raiders head coach has a team that is about to be built for long-term success. Quarterback Derek Carr and All-Pro edge defender Khalil Mack are also expected to sign contract extensions this offseason. General manager Reggie McKenzie, who was extended last year, has shown a keen ability to draft and manage the salary cap while remaining competitive in free agency. \nDel Rio, who coached the Jacksonville Jaguars from 2003-2011, has an 87-84 career record as a head coach (19-13 in two seasons with Raiders). His next step is to lead his rising Raiders team on a playoff run. \nFor his career, Del Rio has not experienced much success in the playoffs. This season marked only his third career postseason appearance, and his only playoff win came back in January of 2008 with the Jaguars. With the talent he has in place in Oakland, the veteran head coach could finally thrive in the playoffs. \nThe biggest challenge for Del Rio in 2017 will be to adjust to his slightly retooled coaching staff. Bill Musgrave, who coordinated the NFL's sixth ranked offense this past season, is no longer with the team. Todd Downing, formerly the team's quarterbacks coach, has replaced Musgrave as offensive coordinator. \nOn defense, Del Rio still has Ken Norton Jr. as his coordinator. After a rough season on that side of the ball, however, the Raiders have also brought in former San Diego Chargers defensive coordinator John Pagano to serve as an Assistant Head Coach - Defense. Defensive backs coach Marcus Robertson was also fired due to season-long struggles on the back end. \nDel Rio carried his entire coaching staff over from his first season to his second season. The new faces in the mix could screw up the chemistry that has led to the Raiders reestablishing themselves as AFC powers. The decision to lock him up with a new contract says that the team trusts him to guide it through the minor turnover we saw this offseason. \nThe next four years of the Silver and Black are now in the hands of the man known as JDR.
