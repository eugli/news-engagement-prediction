Rooney's statement in full \n\"Despite the interest which has been shown from other clubs, for which I'm grateful, I want to end recent speculation and say that I am staying at Manchester United. \n\"I hope I will play a full part in helping the team in its fight for success on four fronts. \n\"It's an exciting time at the club and I want to remain a part of it.\" \nMore to follow.
