It receives about 62 percent of its revenue from its kidney care unit. DaVita in 2015 reported net income of $828 million and said it expected consolidated operating income from several of its dialysis enterprises for 2016 would top $1.8 billion. \nDaVita on Jan. 6, 2017 announced it had been subpoenaed by federal prosecutors in Massachusetts for information related to charitable premium assistance. Its competitor, Fresenius Medical Care in Massachusetts, made the same announcement, as did the AKF. \nDaVita has acknowledged making donations to AKF, but has not disclosed the amount. AKF revealed in its financial disclosures for 2015 that nearly 80 percent of its donations over two years — about $396 million — came from two companies it would not identify. About 180 other companies made up the balance. The nonprofit’s chairwoman, Gail Wick, had been an executive at DaVita and Fresenius, according to its website. \nTax records show the Maryland-based AKF reported nearly $265.3 million in revenues from contributions and grants in 2015, its most recent tax return, and $264 million in grants for patient assistance. Its top executive, CEO Lavarne Burton, was paid $488,697. \nThe shareholder lawsuit against DaVita claims that as a result of the alleged scheme, the publicly traded company’s financial statements were “materially false and/or misleading” because the company’s strong performance in 2015 “was driven, in large part, by (its) illegal efforts to steer patients … for the sole purpose of increasing the company’s profits.” \nIt is the first action nationally against DaVita, coming months after several reports of similar alleged insurance fraud across the industry. \nThe UnitedHealth lawsuit also alleges ARA waived the costs of each patient’s copay, coinsurance and deductible obligations. DaVita is not accused of that conduct. \nAdditionally, ARA patients were not told that they could not receive premium assistance from the kidney fund “if they sought to cure their condition through a kidney transplant,” the Florida lawsuit alleges. \nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services made a public request for information in August regarding the alleged steering of patients. \nCiting DaVita emails, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in October said the company “encouraged some low-income patients to enroll in commercial plans” and of using donations to AKF to fund the premiums. DaVita changed its policy a week later. \nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in December issued a rule requiring dialysis companies to provide patients with more information about their insurance choices and to inform insurance companies when a client’s premiums are paid by an outside party such as a charity. \nDaVita and other companies sued in January, saying the rule was arbitrary and would harm their patients because of the “great disruption” to their care. A federal judge in Texas agreed and suspended the rule , saying the government “has long accepted the practice of charitable premium assistance.” \nDaVita paid $495 million in May 2015 to settle whistleblower claims the company conspired to overcharge the U.S. government. That was seven months after it paid $400 million to settle separate claims that it had offered doctors joint ventures that included agreements not to send patients to non-DaVita clinics. \nLast year the company disclosed its pharmacy arm , DaVita Rx, had received an investigative subpoena from a federal prosecutor in Texas over allegations the company made false payment claims on prescription medicines to the government since 2006. \nDaVita on Feb. 1 announced the federal government will pay the company $538 million to settle claims the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs underpaid it for services performed between 2005 and 2011.
