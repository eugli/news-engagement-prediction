It's a dream role and the feedback has been beyond my expectations. I'm humbled and excited,\" Pheto tells Sowetan LIVE. Radio silence: Is Masechaba Ndlovu really leaving Power FM? \n\"I have always seen Mama Winnie as my hero and icon – I tried to capture that. She is loving, a beautiful human being and very gentle. If there was one thing I loved [in preparing for the role] was watching some of the documentaries of her when she was young and she was very gentle and soft-spoken. I think we will see [in the show] Winnie with the spirit of Ubuntu.\" \nTerry reveals that she was unable to talk to Mama Winnie ahead of taking on the role since she was hospitalized at the time. So for her preparation, she relied on the assistance of some family members, while her extensive research included reading and watching Apartheid materials. \nIn the past there has been widespread criticism from South Africans over the casting of Oscar-winning American actress Jennifer Hudson in the lukewarm 2011 biopic Winnie. In 2013, English screen siren Naomie Harris received critical praises for playing Mama Winnie in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, opposite Idris Elba as Nelson Mandela and Pheto as Evelyn Mase. BURN! All the shade from last night's Penny Penny reality show \nBut what is Terry, born in Evaton and raised in Soweto, bringing to the table that is going to distinguish her from Hudson and Harris? \n\"I grew up with my mother idolizing Mama Winnie, so I felt like I was dealing with someone I have known my entire life and someone that I have met as well. I think what's different is exactly that, now we have someone who really understands what's like to be a South African woman.\" \nOther cast members include Hollywood actor – Laurence Fishburne as Nelson Mandela, Orlando Jones as Oliver Tambo and David Harewood as Walter Sisulu.
