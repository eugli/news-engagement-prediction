Oct. 12, 2016. Chuck Burton/AP Photo \n\"You realized, you know, you don't have a home to go back to, you don't have nothing ... to put in a home. It's just gone,\" Lumberton resident Jennifer Britt told ABC News. Even after the storm passed, many families in the community continued to worry about what was in store for their children, as the local elementary school remained underwater for a week, leaving 150 children out of school. \nBut in the midst of the devastation, two local principals persevered, determined to provide an education to children in the community, and led fellow educators in rising to the occasion and providing extra support for the town's children. \nTara Bullard, the principal of West Lumberton Elementary school, and Angela Faulkner, the principal of Lumberton Middle School, decided to combine their schools and create a safe space for children to come and continue their education. \n\"Those teachers knew they had a job to do when the hurricane came through,\" said Laurence Harvey, a local parent. \"They knew they had a mission. And they knew that there was no option of failure on this, that they had to make sure that these kids that got, you know, displaced and lost their homes and their lives, and things like that, that they were taken care of. It's just an amazing thing. I've never seen it like that before.\" \nChildren Across the Country Spread Happiness With the Great Kindness Challenge \nTwo guidance counselors, Vicki McGurt and Felicia Hunt, also worked tirelessly to make sure that every child had what they needed to be able to succeed in school. \nBritt said that on the children's first day back at school, McGurt met her daughter, Mya, at the door to give her a hug and make her feel welcome. \n\"Miss Vicki was there to greet her. Miss Vicki actually walked her from the drop off location straight to the cafeteria. So, Miss Vicki never left her,\" Britt said. \nMya Britt, 10, said McGurt's actions \"made me feel like I was safe there.\" \n\"I didn't have to worry about anything,\" Mya added. \nIn the aftermath of the storm, Hunt went door to door throughout the shelters and destroyed homes in the community, discreetly attending to each family's individual needs and collecting donations of school supplies, clothing and toiletries for the students.

And she dug deeper,\" Jamie Lindquist, a teacher at Lumberton Junior High School, said of Hunt's actions. \"She knew who they were and she got it outta them what they needed and how we could help.\" \nMonica Graham, an assistant principal of Lumberton Junior High School, echoed Lindquist's sentiments, saying of Hunt, \"during this time she was our angel. She was truly one of our angels.\" \n\"I know how lost we would be without her,\" Graham added. \nMany in the community said that these four women went above and beyond during this difficult time to inspire, lead and provide hope to the town's children. \nBritt said that the actions of the educators helped the students cope with the devastation. \n\"I think it instilled in them, you know, 'This is only gonna make you stronger,'\" Britt said of the educators' actions. \nMya Britt added, \"whatever you do, whatever comes towards you, whatever happens, just know that there is somebody, somebody that has enough heart to do something to help you for something. Whatever it is, they'll be there for you.\" \nTo honor the work of these four women, Disney, the parent company of ABC News' \"Good Morning America,\" donated a playground for Lumberton's local recreational center after their previous playground was destroyed by Hurricane Matthew. As part of the \"We are GMA\" campaign, Lowe's also donated $50,000 to help rebuild the recreational center that had been damaged in the flooding. \nThe city still has a way to go to rebuild. Over 350 families in the county are still living in temporary housing, according to FEMA, and thousands are reliant on FEMA assistance.
