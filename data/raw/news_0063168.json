However, both fell short of the magic figure of 114 needed to control the civic body. \nAlso Read: BJP's win in civic polls a mandate on transparency, shows trust of voters in PM Modi: Fadnavis \nThe fractured mandate after the civic elections elections has thrown a hung house, which now requires the two main players – BJP and Shiv Sena – to rest their political calculations since none is in the position to rule the country's richest civic body on its own and alliance now seems inevitable. \nAmong other options, the two parties may agree to a post-poll alliance on the lines of Kalyan-Dombivili Municipal corporation, where both parties share mayor’s post for half-term each. \nHowever, it is not yet clear whether the saffron allies, who share power both in Maharashtra and at the Centre, will get back together or new combinations will emerge. \nIn the counting of votes held today, the Congress was relegated to the third position with 31 seats, whereas the NCP and the Raj Thackeray's MNS were reduced to 9 and 7 seats, respectively. \nAfter the formal announcement of the results, bot CM Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray thanked the voters in Maharashtra but remained non-committal on BMC tie-up? \nSo a question which now arises is who – Uddhav Thackeray or Devendra Fadnavis – will blink first? \n\"What is the hurry? Wait for some time. We have not yet decided if an alliance is to be made or not. We will do so soon,\" Thackeray said at a press conference. \n\"But I can assure that not only the Mayor, even the future Chief Minister will be from the Sena,\" he said. \nThackeray, however, conceded that the party had expected to win more seats. \n\"But, whatever we have won, we have won on the merit of our Sainiks (workers). We are thankful to Mumbaikars who have kept their faith in us for the fifth consecutive time,\" he said. \n\"I am still eating victory sweets....yet to decide if an alliance will be struck... I have not thought about alliance (yet)....I only know we are number one party,\" he said. \nEarlier, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis too appeared to dodge the question. \"All decisions for the party are taken by its core committee. Whether or not to go for an alliance will be decided when I, (Maharashtra BJP President) Raosaheb Danve, (Mumbai BJP chief) Ashish Shelar sit and look at the prevailing situation,\" Fadnavis told reporters. \nFadnavis said the results are an ample indication that people have accepted Prime Minister Narendra Modi's note ban move and the state government's transparency plank. \n\"Our politics consists of trust and transparency. This result is a reflection that people have accepted our style of governance. No other party in the last 25 years has got such a wonderful result,\" he said. \nIn signs of a thaw after a bitter campaign, Chandrakant Patil, a minister in the Devendra Fadnavis cabinet, said it was time to reunite. \"Enough of bitterness. Now, it's time to come together again,\" he said. \n\"Is there any other option than the two parties coming together, given the number of seats each one has bagged? Will they (Shiv Sena) take support of Congress?\" said Patil, known to have excellent rapport with the central BJP leadership. \n\"Instead of indulging in unscientific things, like taking Congress along, both the parties should do things which are scientific and come together to govern Mumbai,\" Patil said. \n\"Devendra Fadnavis and Uddhav Thackeray should decide the power-sharing formula. Both are good friends,\" the minister said. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Friday, February 24, 2017 - 09:33 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:26:13.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
