Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA British terrorist who carried out a deadly suicide bombing in Iraq was a Manchester convert to Islam who appears to have hoodwinked his family and supporters into believing he was an innocent traveling through Muslim countries to teach English. \nJamal al-Harith - who was born Ronald Fiddler and raised in Moss Side - detonated a car bomb at an army base near Mosul earlier this week, killing an unknown number of Shiite Muslims. \nHe had been held captive at the maximum security Camp Delta at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba from 2001 after American troops had arrested him in Kandahar for allegedly fighting alongside the Taliban against British and US troops in Afghanistan. \nThe web designer protested his innocence - claiming he was in Afghanistan to teach English - and his case was championed by furious civil rights groups and the Tony Blair Government, who campaigned for his release. Jamal al-Harith was raised in Moss Side and attended Ducie High School and Wythenshawe Technical College \nIslamic State fighter with links to Manchester 'carries out suicide bombing in Iraq' \nThe former Ducie High School pupil claimed he was a tourist who was being held by the Taliban as a British spy when the Americans moved into Kandahar. \nHis father Lloyd Fiddler said at the time: “It breaks my heart and I am praying for him. I don’t know what I can do to help him. He’s not what they think he is.” \nThe website designer was named Ronald Otis Fiddler by his Jamaican parents Lloyd and Joyce when he was born in 1965, the third of four children. \nAfter Ducie, he moved to Wythenshawe Technical College where he had many Muslim friends. He converted to Islam when he was 25 and later went to the Sudan to learn Arabic. \nThe then Manchester Central MP Tony Lloyd - now the Police and Crime Commissioner - called his ongoing detention a ‘disgrace’ and called on the authorities to release or charge him. Iraqi security forces advance on the southern outskirts of Mosul, Iraq, Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2017. A military spokesman says Iraqi forces are consolidating their gains south of Mosul ahead of moving deeper into the city's Islamic State-held western half. The spokesman of the Joint Military Operation Command, Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool, told The Associated Press that nearly 123 square kilometers -- about 47 square miles -- have been taken south of Mosul since the new push started on Sunday.

I’m not ashamed of him, I never will be. But it’s his own decision. I can only just give him advice if he needs any.” \nThe 53-year-old said his brother had been a keen sportsman in his youth, playing football, basketball and table-tennis and winning a trophy for karate when he was a teenager.

Major General Michael Dunlavey concluded he ‘was not affiliated to al-Qaeda or a Taliban leader’. \nDespite the conclusion, Al-Harith remained in custody for a further 18 months. \nBut a later ruling signed by Major General Geoffrey D Miller in July, 2003, overturned the original assessment, insisting ‘this detainee possesses a high threat to the US, its interests and allies’. \nIt was unclear why the assessment was later changed again, prompting Al-Harith’s release in March, 2004. \nThe document outlined US fears about their detainee. \nIt said he was ‘probably involved in a former terrorist attack against the US’ although it does not give details.

The British concluded he was ‘cocky and evasive’, it continues. \nThe document also says Al-Harith failed a lie-detector test in April, 2003. He was asked whether he had links with extremists or whether he had gone to Afghanistan for Jihad – to wage holy war. \n“He answered ‘no’ to both questions and was found deceptive each time,” according to the assessment.
