Pistons point guard Reggie Jackson (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:33 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:33 p.m. ET \nPistons coach Stan Van Gundy told the Pistons' Reggie Jackson last month he would not be traded for Timberwolves point guard Ricky Rubio. That doesn't mean he won't be traded at all before Thursday's deadline. \nThe Pistons and Magic have discussed a deal that would send Jackson to Orlando in exchange for D.J. Augustin and Jeff Green, according to ESPN's Marc Stein . The trade is certainly not imminent, as Stein notes Detroit has been exploring the NBA market to find out what kind of return it could get on Jackson's services. \nMORE: Ranking every player in the 2017 All-Star Game \nJackson has struggled this season â€” to say the least. His per-game averages have dropped across the board, and he doesn't look nearly as quick or explosive attacking the basket as he did in 2015-16 when he posted career-highs in points (18.8) and assists (6.2) per game. Jackson lost the first 21 games of this season to knee and thumb injuries, but his playing style has also hurt the Pistons' offense. \nBackup point guard Ish Smith has roundly outplayed Jackson, pushing the tempo and furthering offensive movement. Jackson prefers to work out of pick-and-roll situations and can be a possession stopper who dribbles the air out of the ball. That's without mentioning Jackson's inability to take on the defensive assignment of guarding the league's top players at his position. That usually falls to Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. \nThis doesn't mean Smith is a better player than Jackson in a vacuum, but the Pistons are outscored by 7.3 points per 100 possessions with Jackson on the floor. With Smith, Detroit outscores opponents by 2.1 points per 100 possessions . \nVan Gundy put it in the simplest terms when speaking with ESPN's Zach Lowe : \"Reggie came back, and we've struggled ever since.\" \nQ&A: Van Gundy won't be quiet when it comes to America's issues \nEven when you factor in Jackson's poor play and questions about his fit with the Pistons, a return of Augustin and Green would be an absolutely awful deal for Detroit. Jackson is only a year removed from his most productive season as a pro, and the team is still No. 8 in the East. \nOrlando would snag a playmaker at point guard for two pieces it's more than willing to give up. Jackson, one of the most frequent runners of pick-and-roll plays in the league, may have more freedom to run pick-and-rolls with big men like Nikola Vucevic and Bismack Biyombo. The spacing and lack of shooting remains an issue with either team, but perhaps the Magic believe coach Frank Vogel can unlock whatever potential Jackson still has left. \nAs for the financial implications, the Pistons would drop the remaining three years and $51 million on Jackson's contract and add the three years and more than $21 million left on Augustin's deal. Green is on a one-year, $15 million deal, so Detroit could let him walk if the rental doesn't work out. Green's history indicates that would likely be the case. \nThat's just not enough for Jackson's talent. As Stein and Lowe have reported, this is merely a discussion taking place, but the Pistons would be wise to look for a much better offer or keep Jackson in the hopes he will return to form.
