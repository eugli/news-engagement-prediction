In its fifth edition, the festival is upping the ante with three new curated fun zones (termed 'hubs') and a solid activity line-up. These include a playground with giant inflatable animals, a workshop where you can build your own Virtual Reality device – out of cardboard, no less – and good ol’ Uncle Ringo carnival rides. That’s not forgetting the bedrock of the festival, its 20 environmentally-friendly light art installations which illuminate the waterfront. Check out these seven artworks, inspired by everything from sea to space, that leave a dazzling impression. 1 Image courtesy of Choi+Shine 1/7 Urchin by Choi+Shine Architects Inspired by the spherical shape and intricate texture of sea urchins, the Urchin is a massive light structure that sports its own permeable and decorated surface. Take a photo – the Urchin’s delicate lace pattern juxtaposed against the city skyline scores instant Instagram points. 2 Image courtesy of Singapore University of Technology and Design 2/7 Kaleidoscopic Monolith by the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) This one is as trippy as it sounds. Made with 3D printers, robotic knife-cutters, and other fancy tech, the Kaleidoscopic Monolith is one huge optical illusion: it seems to be curved outwards from a distance, but on closer inspection, is made of many small lightweight concave plates that distort light. Kenneth Tracy, one of the brains behind the monolith, compares the structure to a Rorschach test: the artwork is experienced uniquely by each viewer as it illuminates onlookers with their own reflections. 3 3/7 The Body of the Sea by Danny Rose Collective We’ve heard those ‘Merlion spitting into the bay’ jokes one too many times. But here’s a new take on the overused quip, The Body of the Sea – a light- and water-based artwork which has the Merlion ‘breathing in’ the waters of Marina Bay. Danny Rose Collective, a multidisciplinary art and design team from France, projects marine-inspired images, sound, and an ebb and flow of colours onto the national icon’s exterior, painting it in a completely new light. 4 4/7 Secret Galaxies by Syndicate The night sky has always intrigued humankind – but instead of looking up, look to the ArtScience Museum for a celestial-inspired visual spectacle. Titled Secret Galaxies , the iconic exterior of the museum is transformed into a canvas, as audio-visual collective Syndicate projects images and stories that explore how the stars and our everyday lives are inextricably linked. 5 5/7 Dande-lier by COLOURS, Web Structure and SUTD Make a wish and be transported to an alternate world of light in the Dande-lier, where the smart lighting system responds dynamically to where you’re standing. The individual pieces of the Dande-lier are mundane everyday objects – lightweight umbrellas – that come together to form an extraordinary structure reminiscent of a dandelion. The installation is lit up gently like a chande lier , (hence the second part of the structure’s name), giving it an almost other-worldly glow. 6 6/7 Social Sparkles by Toer Walk amidst fireflies in a forest – or come close to it with Social Sparkles. Created by Toer, the creative studio of Castor Bours and Wouter Widdershoven from the Netherlands, this interactive artwork sees a hundred overhead lights coming to life as you walk beneath them. Blink and you’ll miss them – the lights disappear as quickly as they appear, creating a constantly-moving, shimmering canopy that follows you around as you explore the space. 7 7/7 Northern Lights Can’t find time to travel and see the Northern Lights? Fret not, for the aurora borealis is set to be re-created right at Marina Bay’s waterfront promenade. Inspired by the beauty of this natural phenomenon, Swedish artist Aleksandra Stratimirovic creates her own version of the Northern Lights – one made out of 100 vertically-positioned LED light lines. The lights change and move to tell a dynamic visual story, playing with and reflecting off the surrounding cityscapes. Festival hubs This year’s i Light sees three new event hubs complementing the light art installations. Expect hands-on workshops, kid-friendly activities and a great variety of grub to chow down on. The Fantastical World of eco.me This festival hub will see The Promontory @ Marina Bay transformed into an enchanting playscape – there’s an eco-friendly marketplace where vendors sell a range of green products such as organic clothing, up-cycled furniture and accessories made of recycled materials. Alternatively, put your green thumbs to work at the urban farming showcase, amidst live performances from NOISE Singapore bands. Art-Zoo Take a walk on the wild side at The Float @ Marina Bay, where the Art-Zoo installation is setting up camp. Frolic through this inflatable playground that resembles a zoological garden with super-sized, inflatable animals (the tallest is a giraffe towering at a height of 15 metres). And don’t worry, there’s no upper age limit – so don’t feel guilty about unleashing the kid in you. Gastrobeats This is one for the foodies and audiophiles. Gastrobeats at Bayfront Event Space serves up pop-up food stalls and live music performances – so get ready to feast your senses. Jam to tunes from acoustic pop duo Scarlet Avenue, rapper THELIONCITYBOY or channel ’90s-inspired vibes with Disco Hue’s indie electronic tunes. All this while you chow down on nosh provided by Skewer Bar – perfect for all you carnivores out there – fresh Hawaiian poke bowls from Poke Theory and artisanal granola from Eats My Life.
