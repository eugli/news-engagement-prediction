Today, the Kat Von D Everlasting Nudes Collection will launch for 48 hours only as the February flash item. We have a strong feeling that it will sell out just as fast as the sepia lipstick did. Yes, the Kat Von D Everlasting Nudes Collection came out last week, but this is the first time they will be sold as a set. You'll get all six full-sized tubes of the new nude liquid lipsticks for a special discounted price. Individually, the lip products are $20, but the bundle will go for $99. That means you'll be saving $21 so you can put that money toward next month's Everlasting Flash event. ICYMI these sales will be happening on the first Wednesday of every month this year, and there are 19 new more shades of the cult-favorite Everlasting Liquid Lipsticks to look forward to. If you happen to have no idea which nude lipsticks we're referring to, here's a quick refresher. If you prefer a light pink nude lipstick, you'll love Muñeca (a pinky apricot), Ophelia (a light peach), and Ludwig (a tawny rose). There's also three brown ones for darker skin tones. However, if you're more fair, they'll give you major '90s vibes. There's Sanctuary (the sepia that dropped last month), Hawkwind (a warm nutmeg that Allure editors have been drooling over), and Crucifix (a deep chocolate).
