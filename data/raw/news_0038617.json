Not only that, but they've also decided to bring in fan favorite franchise Mighty Morphin Power Rangers just in time for the upcoming film reboot. The new minis are part of a yearlong celebration of pop culture's most unique and powerful friendships and will include new minis like Victor as Goldar, D-10 as Lord Zedd, Henry as Batman Beyond, Emily as Vixen, Percy as Red Tornado, and Dash as Booster Gold. \n“The new Thomas & Friends MINIS based on famous pop culture teams are a cool way of celebrating legendary, epic friendships,” said Mike Pisors, Director of Thomas & Friends Toy Global Brand Marketing. “We love that Thomas & Friends is a leader is showcasing positive friendship role models for young children, and we’re thrilled to combine the brand with other popular franchises such as the DC Super Friends and Power Rangers for kids to collect.” \nThe Power Rangers and DC Comics minis will be sold as 4-packs for $6.99 and 9-packs for $14.99.
