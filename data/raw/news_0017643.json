The ages of those receiving assistance are between 1 and 92.\nMike Adamson, chief executive of the British RedCross, said:\n\"These figures point to a steady increase in the number of people who flee war and violence only to risk being left destitute and reliant on charities for basic necessities, including the ability to feed and clothe their children.\"\n– Mike Adamson, chief executive of the British RedCross Asylum applications have increased across Europe following the Syrian Civil War and continued conflict across Africa and parts of the Middle East.

Mr Adamson said:\n\"No one should be left homeless after fleeing the devastating conflict in Syria or persecution in Eritrea. Instead of creating a more hostile system which puts even more people at risk of living hand to mouth, we want to work with the Government to address this largely hidden and silent crisis.\"\n– Mike Adamson, chief executive of the British RedCross A child refugee in the Calais 'Jungle' camp ahead of its demolition last year.

A spokesman for the department added:\n\"The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection, but those who are refused asylum and have exhausted their appeal rights are expected to leave the UK.\" The Red Cross defines an individual as destitute if they do not eat sufficiently, have no fixed home, cannot afford essential items such as clothes and toiletries, and/or are experiencing worsening health.\"\n– The Home Office. leicester East Midlands", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:06:50.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
