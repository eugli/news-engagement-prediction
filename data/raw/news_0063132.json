By: FE Online | Published: February 24, 2017 11:57 AM \nIn an earlier report, a camouflaged Hyundai Xcent was seen testing in India which the company is launch this year. According to a more recent report from NDTV, the company will launch the facelifted Xcent in April 2017 which will receive cosmetic updates and a new 1.2 litre diesel engine like its hatchback sibling, the Grand i10. The compact sedan will share its bits with the new Grand i10 and features like a redesigned bumper, cascading front grille design, new fog lamps and LED DRLs may be included. The rear, however, is expected to largely remain same. The 1.2 litre Kappa petrol engine will be retained from the current generation and the Xcent is likely to get the new 1.2 litre diesel engine which has also been seen under the bonnet of the facelifted Grand i10. The 1.2 litre petrol engine produces 81 hp of power and 113.7 Nm of torque and is mated to a 5-speed manual as well as a 4-speed automatic gearbox in the Grand i10. The 1.2 litre diesel engine will generate 73 hp of power at 4,000 rpm and 190.2 Nm of torque which is paired to a 5-speed manual transmission. These configurations will remain the same for the updated Xcent. \nInside the cabin, Hyundai will give the facelifted Xcent a new set of features such as a touchscreen infotainment system with smartphone connectivity Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Mirror Link connectivity as well as navigation. Safety package, that is expected to be available on the higher variants would include reverse parking sensors and ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) with EBD (Electronic Brakeforce Distribution). Dual airbags might be a standard feature on all variants of facelifted Xcent. The all new Xcent will be priced more than the current generation and is expected to be between Rs 5.90 lakh and Rs 8.70 lakh, ex-showroom, Delhi. When launched, the facelifted Xcent will compete with the likes of Maruti Suzuki DZire, Honda Amaze and Volkswagen Ameo. \nHyundai launched the 2nd Generation Xcent in 2014, to compete with Maruti Suzuki Dzire and Honda Amaze. It will be interesting to see which car will attract more customers in the market as Maruti Suzuki is also planning to bring a facelifted DZire by mid of this year with more features but the same powertrain.
