(Scott Smeltzer / Daily Pilot) \n“Sunny was a beautiful young woman. She was just beginning to start her career,” Alan Sudweeks said. “She had a bright future and that was all lost when she was attacked and killed by [Hernandez Tellez]. I’m also angry that for 20 years he has been enjoying life, raising his own children, and yet he denied us the comfort and value of our daughter.” \nSandy Sudweeks appealed to the Mexican government to turn Hernandez Tellez over to American authorities. \n“My only prayer over the years has been that the man who killed her could not hurt anyone else,” she said. \nHernandez Tellez was 23 and living in Santa Ana in 1997. Police do not believe he and Sudweeks knew each another. A motive for the killing isn’t clear. \nOn the night of Feb. 22, 1997, police said Sudweeks had been chatting on the phone in her upstairs apartment in the 1000 block of Mission Drive. She made her last call to a girlfriend around 11 p.m. and went to bed. \nThe three-bedroom apartment, which she shared with her boyfriend and another roommate, was full of boxes. The group had planned to move three days later. The door was unlocked and her window left open, her family said. \nPolice say that between midnight and 4 a.m. Feb. 23, a man entered Sudweeks’ apartment, raped and strangled her before fleeing the scene. \nHer boyfriend returned from his night shift as a cab driver early that morning and found her body lying in her bed. \nDetectives scoured the scene, collecting more than 130 DNA samples and 265 pieces of evidence. They canvassed the neighborhood conducting interviews and passed out fliers hoping to find anyone who witnessed something in those early-morning hours. Fingerprints from the crime scene that had been input in a database didn’t return a match. \nWith no leads to pursue, the case grew cold. But even years later, it weighed on the minds of authorities. \n“It’s one of those cases you just never forget,” Beckman said. \nDetectives reviewed the case several times over the years without success. In November 2016, with the 20th anniversary of the killing approaching, detectives decided to reopen the case. \nThey got their first break. \nUsing DNA evidence collected from the crime scene, Parabon NanoLabs, a medical laboratory based in Virginia, provided police with a snapshot profile of a suspect. The process uses DNA to calculate a possible suspect’s facial composite, skin color, eye color, hair color, freckles, gender and ancestry. \nShortly after, detectives ran fingerprints collected at the scene in the national database. The prints matched those collected from Hernandez Tellez from a prior arrest. \nThe resemblance between the snapshot and Hernandez Tellez’s booking photo from 2000 was uncanny, Beckman said. \nOver the past two months, detectives have interviewed his family members and tested DNA from one of his relatives against DNA collected from the crime scene. Police say the results show a “high likelihood” that the relative and the perpetrator who killed Sudweeks are related. \n“The Sudweeks family has had to bear an enormous weight over the last 20 years,” Costa Mesa Police Chief Rob Sharpnack said. “We are pleased with where we’re at today, but that’s nothing close to what we’re going to feel when this individual, this heinous criminal, is brought before justice. We will not stop, we will not rest, until this individual is in custody.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss \nPresident Trump has withdrawn protections for transgender students .
