Pin \nBrady meets Chloe at TBD in an attempt to get her to change her mind about keeping Holly. Chloe says Nic brought this on herself. Brady tells Chloe that Nicole dumped Deimos so there's no reason for her to keep Holly. Chloe still thinks Nic's a hot mess. Brady doesn't think this is about Nicole at all. \"You know what, you are not Marlena. Stop shrinking me,\" she says. Brady thinks she's lonely. Lord knows he is, missing Theresa. He asks her to let him be there for her, and rubs her hand. Chloe thinks he has blinders on where Nic's concerned and wonders if he's falling in love with Nicole again. Brady insists that's not it. It hits close to home because of what happened with Tate. Chloe tells him she's moving to New York tonight to find a steady singing gig. Brady says he'll pay her bills if she stays so Maggie can get to know Holly. Chloe thinks it's best if she's not around Nicole. Brady begs her not to do this. \nValerie's son, Eli, arrives at the funeral at St. Luke's for David Banning. He tells his mom he's there to bury his father. Julie approaches and introduces herself. She asks if they've met before. He seems so familiar to her. Eli says they haven't and gives his condolences. They all take their seats. Julie gives a eulogy, telling family and friends that they loved each other but had a difficult time getting along. She regrets not seeing him in recent years and hopes he knew how much she loved him. Eli is visibly affected by her candor. She breaks down and Doug hugs her. Later, Ciara and Claire make up and she takes off with Theo. Abe meets Eli and it's awkward. Val goes to Julie and assures her that David knew she loved him. Julie tells her to cherish Eli. \"Family is everything.\" Val uncomfortably looks away. \nIn the hospital, Abigail tells Chad she's glad he felt he could be honest about kissing Gabi. They agree to put this behind them. He's being discharged this afternoon. Happy, she snuggles close to him as he laughs. He'll never take central heating for granted again. She doesn't regret going after the Orwell device and says she wasn't about to stay home knitting while he took care of business. He smiles. She sounds like her old self. She invites him on a second honeymoon - to Cancun. Chad says Gabi suggests Cozumel instead. Theo shows up as Chad's dressed to go. Chad asks Theo to stay away from Deimos and Dario. Theo will and is glad he doesn't have to stay away from Claire and Ciara. He loves them. He laughs and asks if you can love two people at the same time. In the lobby, Claire shows Abigail the watch Theo got her, but she's down thinking another girl is putting the moves on her man. Abigail can identify. All she can do is make sure Theo knows she loves him. \nMore: Real Andrews returns to Days as a crisis unfolds \nOnce home at the DiMera mansion, Abigail and Chad get cozy on the bed and profess their love for one another and then make love. I can't hear Chad and Abigail talking so the recap is basically going to be, they profess their love & do it. #DAYS #loudbackgroundmusic \nâ€” SheKnows DOOL (@SheKnowsDOOL) February 24, 2017 \nEli and Valerie walk to the park where she asks why he would think David Banning was his father. When he applied to FBI school they did some testing which concluded there was no way he could have been Terrance's son. He's angry that his father is dead and now he'll never know him because of her. Why did she lie? Val says David was afraid of commitment. David had a chance with his son Scotty and didn't make that work. At least Terrance was a good father. Eli argues that he wasn't his father. She asks why he didn't tell her he knew, sooner and he spits that he's good at lying because of her. He's done and walks away, leaving her to cry. \nAt the square, JJ asks Lani on a date. She won't go to the movies because popcorn is too expensive, she won't go skiing because she hates the cold and won't eat carbs, so his choices are limited. She's surprised he's even asking her out, because they got off to a rough start. He wants a do-over. A date. Tonight. She agrees to go for sushi tonight. \nJust In: Craig Robinson to The Talk, Howie Mandel co-hosts The View \nMaggie meets Chloe and Holly at the pub where Chloe lets her know the plan to move to New York. Maggie cries and asks to hold the kid. \nAt the loft, Ciara tries her hand at online dating once more, hoping not to meet another Rory. \nAt TBD, Theo tells Claire about how on edge Val has been over David's death. \nAt the square, Abe finds Val crying. He asks if everything is okay with Eli and she chokes out, \"I don't think he's ever going to forgive me.\" Abe hugs her. \nEli watches Julie and Doug leave St. Luke's and goes to his father's casket. He's sorry he never got to know him. Lani appears and watches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:23:46.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
