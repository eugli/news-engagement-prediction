After all, he's going to make big money doing TV and already lives in a financial stratosphere where he seeks advice from Warren Buffett — presumably on how to build A-Rod Enterprises into a Fortune 500 company. \nBut he loves the fact that Hal Steinbrenner clearly wants him to remain part of the organization. Never mind that Hal still owes him $21 million this year; the owner does seem to have a real affection for his former star, only a few years after A-Rod was at war with the Yankees as part of his failed scorched-earth strategy to avoid a PED suspension. \nIt's a remarkable reversal of fortune for which A-Rod seems genuinely thankful. He said Monday that he turned down offers to play for other teams after his farewell with the Yankees last August largely because of it. A-Rod. (Andrew Savulich/New York Daily News) \n\"I know that was kind of the general sense, that I would probably come back and play,'' he said, \"but being a Yankee means everything to me. I'm grateful for Hank and Hal for the opportunity they gave me to rehab my life, get my life back in order from the mistakes I made.'' \nA-Rod's deceitful past makes it easy to dismiss such gratitude as self-serving, but I feel like I've spent enough time around him over the last 13 years to believe he did grow up after his suspension in 2014, treating people with more respect and seemingly taking the responsibility of parenting his two daughters seriously. \nMaybe Hal Steinbrenner sees that as well. Or maybe he's just dazzled by A-Rod's charm, which can be considerable when he's so inclined. \nBut in any case, the real intrigue is that, according to people close to the situation, Hal has much more of a relationship with A-Rod than he does Derek Jeter. \n\"The only person Jeter was ever close to in the organization was (Joe) Torre,'' says one well-connected source. \"Some of that is just his personality. But his last contract negotiation left a bad taste on both sides too. Derek Jeter with Hal Steinbrenner. \n\"Hal doesn't have anything against Jeter. They just don't have much of a relationship. With Alex it's different. Alex wanted a relationship and Hal really warmed up to him.'' \nChances are Jeter eventually will come around as a celebrity spring training instructor, a Yankee specialty, and take part in Old-Timers Day games as a revered legend. \nBut Jeter has said for years that he wants to be an owner someday, and since Steinbrenner insists he has no interest in selling, that would have to have happen with another franchise. Meanwhile, it's no secret he doesn't have the passion — or patience — that A-Rod has for staying involved in the game on any other level. \nSo although Jeter was always the golden boy, at least publicly, it seems the bad boy is destined to have a stronger connection to the Yankees. \nAnd, sure, A-Rod could have selfish motives here. Jeter's legacy as a future Hall of Famer is assured, while the guy with 696 home runs has the steroids taint that makes him a longshot for Cooperstown. Rodriguez with Brian Cashman. (Andrew Savulich/New York Daily News) \nSo you can't discount the idea that he's trying to at least assure himself a spot in Monument Park by working for Hal, but on the other hand, A-Rod for years has made a point of working with young players, from Michael Young with the Rangers to Robbie Cano and others with the Yankees. \nIn that sense I think his interest in grooming this wave of young Yankee talent is genuine. On and off the field. \n\"I'm kind of in a unique position here from all the things I've done in this game, both good and bad,'' A-Rod said Monday. \"I learned my biggest lessons from some of my mistakes, and they were big ones. I can spend all the time in the world out there on the field but these guys are great talents. \n\"I think my value for these kids is taking them out, having a three-hour dinner. Over the first hour-and-half, recognizing that they'll probably (be) pretty nervous and pretty tight, but over the second half of that dinner they'll start asking real substantial questions. And there's so much that's expected here in New York, and it's so difficult to play in New York, I think that, the best thing we can do to get them ready for what's expected of them there.'' \nAll in all, A-Rod sounded very much invested in his new role, and while he hasn't sat down yet with Steinbrenner to map out a long-term plan, he has the acumen for the game to be an asset for a front office. \nOf course, he and GM Brian Cashman haven't always had the greatest relationship, but there they were together behind the batting cage on Monday, chatting like old friends. \nIf Hal Steinbrnner happened to be watching from his fourth-floor office, he may well have been nodding his approval.
