Cook’s award is the first in Canton Charge history. \nThe reigning NBA D-League Rookie of the Year tallied a game-high 18 points on 7-of-10 shooting (70%) from the field while dishing a game-high 12 assists and grabbing seven rebounds in a game-high 25 minutes for Jerry Stackhouse’s Eastern Conference team. \nA 10-0 run capped by a Vander Blue layup cut the East lead to 101-100 with 1:13 remaining. Maine’s Marcus Georges-Hunt pushed the lead to three with a layup of his own. Following a missed three point attempt by the West’s Blue, Cook drilled an 18 foot jumper with 13.8 seconds remaining to seal the East win at 105-100. \nCanton Charge teammate Eric Moreland impressed in his All-Star debut, narrowly missing out on his accustomed double-double by scoring nine points and grabbing nine rebounds off the bench. \nCook currently ranks second in scoring, posting 26.2 points per game and fifth in assists, dropping 6.2 per contest. Moreland ranks second in the NBA D-League in rebounding, nabbing 11.6 boards per game. \nCanton comes back from the All-star break to wrap up a six-game road trip at the Delaware 87ers (Philadelphia 76ers) on Wednesday, February 22nd at 7:00 p.m. Groups of 20 or more can take part in unforgettable fan experiences such as halftime performances, anthem buddies, high five tunnel, benchwarmers, and more!
