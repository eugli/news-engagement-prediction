[ fave song at the moment?:Justin said “Starboy by The Weeknd”] pic.twitter.com/xAYJTKk4L4 \nIn a Q and A with his fans on the social media app that he just returned to after a seven-month hiatus , one person asked Bieber what his favorite song was at the moment. \nBieber responded in a deadpan fashion, \nUh. ‘Starboy’ by the Weeknd. \nThen he giggled for like 20 seconds. \nThe 22-year-old singer told his friend Alfredo Flores, \nOh, shit. That was funny. \nWhile laughing, Bieber said, \nWe’ve got to end it now. Oh, that was too funny. Bang, bang! \nShots were obviously fired. \nI’m not sure why, though? It’s been how long since Bieber and Gomez were a couple? Like since 2014? \nAh, but it’s true… you never do get over your first love, do you? \nJust last month , when Bieber was asked if he could listen to a song by The Weeknd, he said, \nHell no, I can’t listen to a Weeknd song. That shit’s whack. \nIt seems like the little bit older, little bit wiser singer The Weeknd is taking the high road and ignoring these comments made by the Biebs. \nAfter all, he’s the one who gets to go home with Selena. \nWord of advice, Justin: The sweetest revenge is a well lived life. Also, stop throwing shade at your ex and her new boyfriend — it just looks desperate. \nAt least act like you’re happy for them.
