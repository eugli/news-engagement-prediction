Patrick M. O'Connell Chicago Tribune \nCubs Chairman Tom Ricketts said Monday the team plans to work with city officials to put together an attractive bid to host baseball's 2020 All-Star Game at Wrigley Field . \n\"Hopefully we'll be able to sit down with the city here over the next few months and iron out what it takes to be the leading bidder,\" Ricketts said during an appearance at a City Club of Chicago luncheon. \nThe Cubs last hosted the game in 1990. \nRicketts used the event to bask in the still-warm glow of the team's world championship and updated the crowd on ongoing construction at the ballpark and the surrounding area. The chairman joked that ballpark upgrades have slowed in recent years \"because we can't get crews in there until November, but we think that's a pretty fair trade.\" \nConstruction crews are working on a new Clark Street gate on the west side of the ballpark that will ease congestion at the main home plate entrance and new bullpens under the bleachers, relocated from their long-time place in foul territory. Ricketts said the bullpen relocation is primarily a safety issue. \n\"I'll miss watching the players warm up there but not nearly as much as I'd miss Kyle Schwarber if he tripped over one of those mounds,\" Ricketts said. \nThe chairman said the team has poured $600 million into Wrigley renovations. Much of that cost goes to steel, concrete, electrical and plumbing. A new sound system and the new American Airlines 1914 Club, located behind home plate, will be ready for Opening Day 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:13:06.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
