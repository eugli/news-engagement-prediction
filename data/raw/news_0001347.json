Rowling‚Äôs Responses To Fans Burning Her Books Are Pure Fire üî• üî• üî• 02/02/2017 11:49 am ET Elyse Wanshel Trends Reporter, The Huffington Post \nBritish author J.K. Rowling ‚Äôs Twitter account has had a very specific theme as of late. A quick gander makes it pretty clear that she is not a fan of President Donald Trump or his policies. \nAnd because of this, some Harry Potter fans have threatened to burn their wizarding merchandise if she doesn‚Äôt stay out of politics. \nAs for her response? Let‚Äôs just say that even the book-loving Hermione Granger would be proud. Well, the fumes from the DVDs might be toxic and I've still got your money, so by all means borrow my lighter. pic.twitter.com/kVoi8VGEoK ‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) January 31, 2017 Guess it's true what they say: you can lead a girl to books about the rise and fall of an autocrat, but you still can't make her think. pic.twitter.com/oB7Aq6Xz8M ‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 1, 2017 \nYet, not all fans are upset by her tweets. One actually came to Rowling‚Äôs defense, tweeting to the author , ‚ÄúI‚Äôll buy 2 copies of every book to make up for this and I‚Äôll donate the second copy to an interested reader. Takers?‚Äù \nThis allowed the author to inject some humor into the situation: Actually, we're thinking of selling them in pairs in future; a 'read one, burn one' deal for those who like the magic, but not the morals. https://t.co/EPsXoDodr7 ‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 1, 2017 \nThis is not the first time folks have felt compelled to destroy Harry Potter books. The beloved children‚Äôs series has rattled preachers, priests and religious fundamentalists for years because they feel the books encourage witchcraft, which has led to the series‚Äô frequent banning , and even organized book burnings . \nSo, a few fans tweeting to Rowling to let her know about their arsonist activities probably doesn‚Äôt make her blood boil. \nEspecially since it seems like most of her fans are cool with her political views: I'd just like to thank everyone sending me lovely messages, which greatly outnumber the bad ones üòò I'm now off to produce more kindling... ‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 1, 2017 \nSo, we suppose if you have issues with Rowling‚Äôs opinions and feel the need to tell her, go for it. Girlfriend is just going to hit you right back.
