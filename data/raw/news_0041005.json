He suspected her of infidelity. \nThe woman could have been saved had Kumar’s neighbours in east Delhi’s Madhu Vihar intervened or called police. \nNo one did anything to help the mother of two daughters, despite her shrieks for help. They kept quiet thinking it was a domestic matter. Read more Delhi: Two Fortis doctors operate on wrong foot, lose license for 6 months \n“They quarrelled often as he was living with two wives. We thought it was one of those days. She screamed and cried as he hit her. After he smashed utensils and a window pane, I went and knocked on the door and asked them to keep it low,” said a neighbour, who did not wish to be named. \nKumar opened the door and the neighbour saw his wife on the floor. \n“When I asked, he said his wife’s character is suspect. He said it was their private matter and slammed the door. When his wife saw me, she started crying louder and requested me to rescue her,” he said. \nKumar had locked his second wife and his daughters in another room. \nThe neighbour heard his first wife wailing till morning and couldn’t take it anymore. But instead of calling police, he rang up his landlord and complained. “My landlord told me he would warn him.” \nFor the next two days — Saturday and Sunday — Kumar didn’t step out of his home. He had sent his second wife, with whom he has another daughter, to her village. An eerie silence has descended.

But he left a clue. He confided to a friend that his first wife was dead.
