But Houston police put a value on the jersey, and it turns out the theft actually is a major crime. \nAccording to a police report obtained by TMZ Sports, Brady’s jersey is worth a whopping $500,000, and the crime is listed as a first-degree felony. The Houston police department even has a special major offenders unit on the case, but there reportedly have been no new leads. \nIt seems unlikely anyone will come forward at this point, though, considering the maximum punishment for a first-degree felony in Texas is five to 99 years or life in prison with a $10,000 fine. Brady might have to be satisfied with owning just four Super Bowl jerseys rather than five. \nThumbnail photo via Mark J.
