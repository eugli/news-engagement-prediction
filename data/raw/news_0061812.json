Squatter: A banner reading \"Rogue Embassy\" hangs outside 19 Buckingham Gate (PA) \nBut one of the protesters insisted they were not \"going to do anything\". \nA witness statement filed by Archie Riby-Williams, a director of 18-19 Buckingham Gate Investments Limited said: \"At around 10.30am on February 23, I spoke with...a royal specialist protection officer at Buckingham Palace who expressed his concern about the potential security risk to the Palace if the defendants gained access via the roof of the premises 18 and then 17 Buckingham Gate. \n\"If the defendants were to access the roof of 18 Buckingham Gate in particular, this would enable them to see directly into the garden of Buckingham Palace and this would, in fact, appear to be the defendants' objectives.\" \nSnipers stationed on the roof of Wellington Barracks were in \"regular contact\" with a next-door owner to raise concerns about the view into the palace gardens from the roof, the document said. \nPalace: A shared roof in the property could mean the squatters could peer into the Royal gardens (Getty Images) \nThe occupiers claim to be part of the Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians and said they expected eviction efforts to begin on Friday night. \nIt is the third high-profile building the band of squatters have entered this year. \nThey were evicted from a multimillion-pound property in Eaton Square, central London last month, before immediately moving into a nearby seven-storey building on Grosvenor Gardens. Squatters: The building was occupied by the same group who recently took over properties in Eaton Square and Grosvenor Gardens (PA) \nThe once-lavish property on Buckingham Gate, which neighbours the Swaziland High Commission, has been adorned with flags and banners by its new occupants. \nOwned by Bahraini Abdulrahman Aljasmi, it has stood derelict for decades, the group claimed, leading them to repurpose it as an embassy for \"indigenous people\" and \"nations that are not recognised\". \nOne of the activists said: \"It is a very high-profile building. As a sport, it is an achievement even having a squat for a couple of days. Squatters enter the Â£17m mansion (PA) \n\"It is an achievement to get as near as we can to Buckingham Palace, not that we are going to do anything. \n\"It is theatre for us, it is confrontation theatre.\" \nAnother added they intended to move from \"building to building\" throughout London. \nA Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: \"We never comment on security, which is a matter for the police.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:54:34.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
