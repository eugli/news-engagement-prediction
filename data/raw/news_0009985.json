Come every February, the European Film Market throws open its doors to welcome over 9,230 producers, buyers, sales agents, distributors, exhibitors and financiers to the first major film market of the year.\nThis time Olapeepi â€”the film directed by Krish Kaimal has found a place in the prestigious Film Festival. The film with Biju Menon and Paris Laxmi in the lead told the endearing tale of the bond between a grandson and his grandmother, who was once a very rich landlady, now fallen to penury. The film received critical acclaim for the story line and the performances- especially notable was the acting by the 86 year old veteran drama artiste Kanchanamma who played the role of the frail grandmother. The film is produced under the Vibezon banner and co -produced by Parthan Mohan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T18:56:57.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
