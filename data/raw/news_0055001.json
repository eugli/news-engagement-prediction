The Galaxy J7 carries the model number SM-J727 which is the 2017 model of the device as this isn’t the first version of this phone that Samsung has released. For Verizon, the phone will be labeled as the Galaxy J7 V, and for TracFone the phone will be labeled as the Galaxy J7 Sky Pro , which is the name that Samsung actually trademarked back in the beginning of the this month but at the time it wasn’t known where the device was headed. \nOne day after the Galaxy J7 Sky Pro name was discovered the SM-J727P was found in the FCC database which could be the Galaxy J7 Sky Pro, and with two appearances of different variants of this phone it was only a matter of time before the device was rumored to be headed to one or more U.S. carriers. Along with the mention of the Galaxy J7 for Verizon and TracFone there was an image posted that shows off the device, granted this isn’t the first time the phone has been seen. \nIt isn’t immediately clear which variant the image is showcasing, as it’s not mentioned, though it is worth noting that there doesn’t seem to be any Verizon Wireless branding in sight so it’s likely that this isn’t the model meant for their network. Other than the mention of carrier availability and the image there are no details on specs or other features, though it’s not likely that the specifications will be any different from the models that are available elsewhere. That being said, there could be some different features included, at least for the Verizon model, as they usually end up placing some of their own pre-installed apps on their phones and chances are the same will be true for the Galaxy J7 V. There is no mention of when either version of the phone will Verizon or TracFone’s networks, nor when it will launch on the “other carriers” that were mentioned, and there is no mention of cost.
