This time though, the Honda WR-V's cabin and features have been featured in the images. The company has started delivering the upcoming crossover at its dealerships in the country from its Tapukara plant in Rajasthan. Honda has also acquired 380 acres of land in Gujarat, where the upcoming WR-V will be produced.\nThe spied interior images suggest that the WR-V will share its features with the current-generation Honda Jazz . There are many similarities between the two cars in terms of cabin feature and design such as a black interior theme with silver accents on the AC vents, glove box, as well as on the steering wheel. The top version of the Honda WR-V will get steering mounted controls for the audio system, a touchscreen infotainment system with mirror link smartphone connectivity, voice recognition and a reverse parking camera. These features are also equipped on the newly launched Honda City .\nHonda WR-V will feature a black interior theme with silver accents on the AC vents, glove box, as well as on the steering wheel. (Image Source: Team-BHP.com) The cabin will also receive features like automatic climate control, engine start-stop button, rear AC vents, while the safety equipment will include dual front airbags, ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) with EBD (Electronic Brakeforce Distribution) on the higher trims.\nLike we mentioned in our earlier reports, the WR-V stands for Winsome Runabout Vehicle and will be based on the Honda Jazz's platform. On the outside, the new Honda WR-V will be longer than the BR-V dimensionally. It will also feature chrome front grille, newly designed headlamp cluster and LED headlamps, sculpted bonnet and will get side body cladding in black colour and silver skid plates on the bumpers. The carmaker might also increase the ground clearance of the car and equip it with 17-inch alloy wheels.\nMechanically, the upcoming Honda WR-V is expected to be powered by the same engines that also powers the Honda Jazz, a 1.2 litre petrol with 87 hp and 110 Nm output and a 1.5 litre turbocharged diesel engine that produces 100 hp and 200 Nm. The petrol engine will be paired to a 5-speed manual and a CVT (Continuously variable transmission) automatic gearbox, while the diesel variants will get a 6-speed manual transmission.\nAlso Read: Honda WR-V spotted at dealership, India launch on 16th March\nExpected to be priced between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 10.5 lakh, ex-showroom, Delhi, the Honda WR-V will rival against the likes of the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza , Ford EcoSport , Hyundai i20 Active , Mahindra TUV300 and Toyota Etios Cross in the compact SUV/ crossover segment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:08:32.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
