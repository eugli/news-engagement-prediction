(Marcio Jose Sanchez / AP) The Associated Press Published Saturday, February 11, 2017 8:40PM EST \nSAN FRANCISCO -- An immigration rights group has filed a petition to join a lawsuit by Washington and Minnesota states against President Donald Trump's executive order banning travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. \nThe Northwest Immigrant Rights Project filed the petition Friday in U.S. District Court in Seattle. \nThe group last month filed a federal class-action lawsuit against Trump's order on behalf two U.S. citizens and a legal resident trying to reunite with their children. Plaintiff Juweiya Abdiaziz Ali is a U.S. citizen living in Seattle who started the process last August of bringing her son from Somalia. She says Trump's order has made her worried that her son's visa process will be indefinitely suspended. \nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday unanimously refused to reinstate the order blocked last week by U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle. Robart issued a temporary restraining order halting the ban after Washington state and Minnesota sued.
