The 6-year-old East Londoner, with his cherubic cheeks and wide-eyed gaze, caught the eye of photographer Dan Roberts during London Fashion Week Men's Fall 2017 outside a show, appearing dapper and adorable in a Gucci monogram print raincoat and matching bucket hat. His brother, 11-year-old Jon, was equally handsome while posing in a shearling leather jacket and a Gucci monogram baseball hat . Since then, the brothers have become mini celebrities: Their Vogue.com street style snap was Instagrammed by Rick Ross himself with the caption “ Richforever ,” and they’ve been tapped by Instagram-famous stylist @YouthSmhr . But as it turns out, there aren’t only two brothers with stellar style in the Claudio clan. There are two more: The oldest, 18-year-old Joel, and 8-year-old Juven also add to the well-dressed family. “I would describe my fashion as more streetwear style than the boys, as I am very selective on high-end garments,” writes Joel via email. “Jon is very close to my age, where his environment and generation is streetwear, but he mixes the both with high-end [pieces]. Juven and Just [prefer] completely high-end fashion garments.” Though their styles might differ, their tastes are always elevated. The cool quad prefers to shop online at stores like Selfridges, Childsplay Clothing, Harrods, and Harvey Nichols, while their preferred labels include Versace, Off-White, Balmain, Raf Simons, and Burberry. (Their favorite shows so far? \"Balenciaga, Gucci, Fendi, A Cold Wall & Yeezy collections were good,” writes Joel.) Though no matter what, Just doesn’t waver from the label that put him on the map in the first place: Gucci. “It makes me look shiny, grown, and very big,” says Just. “And cool.” Who could argue?
