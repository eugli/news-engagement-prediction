The company plans to invest 100% in the Thai project, while the investment abroad will be through a joint venture in accordance with rules in the local market. \n\"What I can say is we have taken our time for a certain period to study the new locations of the airports we proposed and we see the potentials and opportunities there,\" Puttipong said. \"It's necessary to set up the airport based on the congested air traffic and the potential that other competitors are yet to realize.\" \nFor the location in Thailand, local reports have suggested that Bangkok Airways is considering construction of an airport in the southern province of Phang Nga, a little north along the Andaman Sea coast from the busy tourist destination of Phuket. \nIf the airport is built, it is expected to help ease traffic at state-owned Phuket International Airport which is currently running over its capacity. In 2016, some 15 million passengers passed through the airport, up 17% on the previous year, while its annual capacity is 12 million, having doubled last year with the opening of a new terminal. \nBangkok Airways currently owns and operates three airports in Thailand. The largest and the most successful of the three is its first airport, which opened in 1989 on Koh Samui, a popular resort island in the Gulf of Thailand. Initially, the airport was solely for Bangkok Airways flights but has recently opened up to national flag carrier Thai Airways International and Singapore's Silk Air. \nFor its airline business, the company is looking to expand more routes into neighboring countries and China. It has launched daily flights between China's Guangzhou and Samui. It also plans to add routes between Bangkok and Phu Quoc in Vietnam, Chiang Mai in the north of Thailand and Vientiane in Laos, and between Chiang Mai and Bagan, Myanmar. \nPuttipong said that passenger growth is expected to be at 12-13% in 2017, accelerating from 9.5% growth in 2016. Passenger load factor is also set to increase to 72% from 69% in 2016.
