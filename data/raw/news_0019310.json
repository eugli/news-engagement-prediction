A manufacturing defect allowed excess water into the pouches, which could put them at risk of supporting the growth of Clostridium botulinum, the bacteria responsible for botulism, said the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). Contaminated food may not look or smell spoiled, but may still cause sickness.\nThe illness is caused by a toxin released by the bacteria, and can cause vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, blurred or double vision, dry mouth, respiratory failure and paralysis. Symptoms may last for weeks, and in severe cases, botulism can be fatal.\nCFIA first issued the recall on Feb. 3, but only included the apple, blueberry and green pea flavours. It now covers all varieties of the pouch, including those that come in boxes.\nThe other varieties may have been store shelves up to and including Feb. 8.\n In Ontario, the pouches were sold at Fortinos, Loblaws, No Frills, Real Canadian Superstore, Real Canadian Wholesale Club, valu-mart, Your Independent Grocer, Zehrs, Shoppers Drug Mart, and affiliated independent stores.\nThe initial recall was triggered by a consumer complaint, CFIA said. A later food safety inspection led to the expansion.\nLoblaw Companies Ltd., which operates Loblaws, is warning customers not to consume the pouches and to either return them or throw them out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:03:52.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
