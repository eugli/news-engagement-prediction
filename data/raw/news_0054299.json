Two other former Peruvian presidents are also facing scrutiny for links with Odebrecht , and Mr Kuczynski himself is facing a preliminary investigation for agreeing a law that removed hurdles to granting road contracts when he was Mr Toledo’s prime minister. \nBut Peru is just one country rattled by the international shockwaves from the admission by Odebrecht, Latin America’s biggest construction company, that it paid $788m in bribes in 12 countries in the region. For its part, Interpol has issued wanted notices for two sons of Ricardo Martinelli, former president of Panama. \nThe case has already led the Brazilian group agreeing in a plea bargain with US, Brazilian and Swiss authorities to make the biggest corruption-related payout in history of at least $3.5bn. But the political repercussions of the case are spreading, shaking governments and politicians across Latin America. \nThe rise of leftist populist governments across the region at the turn of the century was propelled by poverty and inequality. Now, in crisis-hit Venezuela authorities raided the Caracas offices of Odebrecht, after the company admitted paying $98m in bribes supposedly to socialist officials — the highest amount outside of Brazil. \nJuan Carlos Varela, Panama’s leader, denied receiving campaign donations from Odebrecht, as alleged by Ramón Fonseca of the law firm at the centre of the so-called Panama Papers scandal and a former adviser. But Ramón Arias of Transparency International in Panama said Mr Varela was “losing support and legitimacy by the day”. \nAs the economic downturn continues to bite across the region, “people are increasingly associating the fact that there’s a slowdown with corruption. They feel that if there’s no money now, it means it’s because someone in the government stole it,” says Paulina Recalde of pollster Perfiles de Opinión in Ecuador. \nWhile governments face allegations of receiving illegal election donations or kickbacks from Odebrecht, the silver lining of the disruptive investigation is a newfound adherence to the rule of law in growing pockets of Latin America. However, analysts warn, this could open the gates for a renewed boost of populism. The Big Read Record fine for illegal payments by Odebrecht raises hopes of end to the country’s culture of impunity Wednesday, 22 February, 2017 \n“Corruption was something present but abstract. Now people really feel politicians were stealing from their pockets. This will surely have electoral consequences,” explains Luis Benavente, a political analyst with the Lima-based consultancy Vox Populi. “It could easily feed the rise of anti-establishment candidates.” \nAlready in Mexico, where state-oil company Pemex is being investigated by the state comptroller’s office for its links with Odebrecht, populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador is promising to stamp out corruption and sweep out the “mafia of power” in yet another attempt to win the presidency next year. \nIn Brazil the sweeping investigation that led to Odebrecht’s fall from grace is entering its fourth year. The probe known as Car Wash initially focused on state-owned oil company Petrobras , one of Odebrecht’s main customers, before spreading to the group. It helped lead to the fall of former president Dilma Rousseff in 2016 . \nHer replacement, former vice-president Michel Temer , is also battling allegations of receiving illegal funds. With testimony from 77 Odebrecht executives expected to soon be released by the supreme court, Mr Temer runs the risk of having his tenure terminated if he is found to be involved. EM Squared Disgraced construction group paid bribes to a huge number of politicians beyond Brazil Wednesday, 22 February, 2017 \nThe scandal, coupled with Brazil’s worst recession in more than a century, has thrown wide open the nation’s elections next year. That may also be the case in Colombia, where President Juan Manuel Santos and a political opponent have been tarnished by accusations. \nMaría Luisa Puig at Eurasia Group says this “paves the way for candidates rallying on anti-corruption platforms” in Colombia’s 2018 presidential poll. Argentina’s President Mauricio Macri faces crucial midterm elections this year at a time when the director of the intelligence agency is accused of receiving an Odebrecht bribe in 2013. \nThere is no sign of the pressure letting up. Last week, prosecutors from nine Latin American countries held closed-door talks in Brasília and agreed to set up investigation teams to provide “the most extensive, speedy and efficient international judicial co-operation”. Politicians in the region have been placed on notice. Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.
