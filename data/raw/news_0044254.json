He's considered a war hero. During the Gulf War in 1991, McMaster was a captain commanding Eagle Troop of the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of 73 Easting . During that battle, he and his team were significantly outnumbered when they encountered the enemy by surprise. His lead tank and nine other tanks of Eagle Troop destroyed over eighty Iraqi Republican Guard tanks and other vehicles without loss, largely because the American tanks were higher quality. For his actions, he was awarded the Silver Star, and taught the battle as a military history professor at his alma mater, West Point, from 1994 to 1996. (And, fun fact, his success during the battle was included in the Tom Clancy nonfiction novel, Armored Cav .)\n4. He helped to pacify the city of Tal Afar in 2005.

In a July 14, 2014, interview with the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer , the then the base commander, said: \"Some people have a misunderstanding about the Army. Some people think, hey, you’re in the military and everything is super-hierarchical and you’re in an environment that is intolerable of criticism and people don’t want frank assessments. I think the opposite is the case ... And the commanders that I’ve worked for, they want frank assessments, they want criticism and feedback.\" McMaster was finally awarded his first star on his third and final try from General David Petraeus.\n8. He's been on Time 's list of 100 most influential people in the world. In 2014, McMaster made Time ' s list of the 100 most influential people in the world.

Dave Barno, wrote, \"Major General Herbert Raymond McMaster might be the 21st century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker. Recently tapped for his third star, H.R. is also the rarest of soldiers—one who has repeatedly bucked the system and survived to join its senior ranks.\"\nFollow Laura on Twitter .\n ", "external_links": ["http://time.com/collection-post/70886/herbert-raymond-mcmaster-2014-time-100/", "http://twitter.com/mrpenguino", "http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article29321878.html", "http://www.tradoc.army.mil/index.asp", "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2008/08/annual_general_meeting.html", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_73_Easting", "http://www.arcic.army.mil/", "http://libguides.usna.edu/c.php?g=410518&p=2796887", "https://books.google.com/books?id=aku_V8GmABwC&pg=PA229&lpg=PA229&dq=katie+trotter+mcmaster&source=bl&ots=XDaaUHXDf_&sig=XyXpEm4CUPO4EMW6ltwbIf9xYUM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi_lKPbwp_SAhUBUWMKHW26ChkQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=katie%20trotter%20mcmaster&f=false", "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/magazine/26military-t.html"], "published": "2017-02-20T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:45:16.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
