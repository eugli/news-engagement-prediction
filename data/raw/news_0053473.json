Article continues below \nOn his Instagram feed, Hamilton explained to his followers about the different dimensions of the new helmet and applauded the overall design himself. \nThe helmet utilises candy apple red throughout the design to balance the other colours, and this colour scheme continues onto the helmet's visor. Article continues below \nReaction on Hamilton’s Instagram feed has been positive, with fans praising the overall look of the helmet saying that they could not wait to see him in it. \n“@caribbeanroyalty_k Love it! Can't wait to see you with it this season” \n“@sherylkhans Dope design!! Good job guys.” \n“ @leeleemur Amazing, love it!! Can’t wait to see you on the track with it xx” \nHamilton thanked the Brazilian designer Raí Caldato via his Instagram feed, and stated that he looked forward to meeting him: “ Raí, I look forward to meeting you in person to present you with your prize! Thank you all for entering this competition, I'm taken back by your creativity.” \nThe Brit will be racing in search for his fourth world championship, as he looks to overcome the likes of Max Verstappen, Daniel Ricciardo, Sebastian Vettel, and, of course, his new teammate Valtteri Bottas. \nMercedes will release their car for the new season tomorrow (Thursday 23), and the first race of the season will take place Down Under in Australia next month. \nUnsurprisingly, Hamilton is the favourite to win the championship following Nico Rosberg's shock retirement at the end of last season. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
