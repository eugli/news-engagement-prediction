(Getty Images: David Malan) \nHow does the evidence for complementary medicines stack up? \nGetty Images: David Malan Close \nWhether it's fish oil for heart health, cranberry for urinary tract infections or echinacea for a cold, the market for supplements is growing. \nMore than 60 per cent of all Australians use some type of supplement and the Australian complementary medicine industry reportedly generated $4.7 billion in revenue in 2016, up from $3.5 billion in 2014. \nAn investigation on tonight's Four Corners focuses on the role chemists play in the selling and promotion of supplements. It highlights concerns from many in the medical profession that chemists are lending a halo effect to treatments for which there is often little evidence of effectiveness , and question marks over safety. \nVitamins are the most commonly consumed supplements, but herbal medicines derived from plants are also popular. \nMany of us use supplements as a companion to drugs we're prescribed by our doctors, while some of us turn to them because we're dissatisfied with conventional medicines and treatments. \nOne of the main concerns regarding these complementary medicines is that they aren't tested and regulated to the same level as prescription drugs , said Sarah Spagnardi, a pharmacist with NPS MedicineWise. \n\"You really don't know what's in it and whether you're getting what you pay for,\" Ms Spagnardi said. \nAs well, supplements can interact with other medicines in unforeseen ways and it's hard to know what you're getting when you buy supplements online. \nSo, what's the evidence supporting the use of Australia's most popular supplements? Calcium and vitamin D Is a calcium supplement an effective way to strengthen bones? (Flickr.com: Caden Crawford (CC-BY-ND-2.0)) \nIs a calcium supplement an effective way to strengthen bones? \nFlickr.com: Caden Crawford (CC-BY-ND-2.0) Close \nMany of us take calcium to prevent osteoporosis, but is there any evidence it helps? \nEarly studies in the 1970s and 80s were promising, but a more recent meta-analysis has shown no evidence to support the need for calcium supplements for the average Australian. \n\"It certainly seemed logical that taking calcium and vitamin D might strengthen bones, and there were some studies that suggested that,\" adjunct associate professor with Monash University's School of Public Health, Dr Ken Harvey, said. \n\"But for the average Australian, no — they've been overhyped and overpromoted. The message is that getting your calcium from dairy food is appropriate and getting your vitamin D from the sun is all you need unless you're in special circumstances.\" \nDr Harvey said exceptions to that rule included those who eat no dairy, people who cover their bodies for religious reasons, and those who often remain inside for days or weeks at a time with little physical activity, like some people in nursing homes. \nThe confusing mix of evidence around calcium and vitamin D - as well as many of the other complementary medicines on this list - is a symptom of the way scientific research has been done in the medical field, according to Dr Harvey. \n\"Classically, initial studies look promising and sometimes that's translated into recommendations for consumers. But then more studies are done, larger studies, and we usually come to a different conclusion,\" Dr Harvey said. \n\"Ultimately, we want more trials, larger numbers, replication, and freedom from bias. Then we get consistent results in one way or another.\" Fish oil Fish oil capsules are one of Australia's most popular supplements - but what's the evidence supporting their use? (Flickr: Jo Christian Oterhals (CC-BY-NC-ND-2.0)) Share \nFish oil capsules are one of Australia's most popular supplements - but what's the evidence supporting their use? \nFlickr: Jo Christian Oterhals (CC-BY-NC-ND-2.0) Close \nFish oil contains omega-3 essential fatty acids and is said to have an effect on blood chemistry, inflammation, and our immune system. \nIt's commonly used for a range of conditions, including heart disease, arthritis and ADHD. \nSome research shows fish oil supplements reduce triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood), but whether they reduce your risk of heart disease is less clear. \nRecent studies show the supplements may not be as helpful as previously thought in reducing the risk of heart attack or stroke. A 2012 meta-analysis of 20 studies found no association between omega-3 supplementation and risk of cardiac arrest, heart attack or stroke. \nAt one point the Heart Foundation recommended Australian adults consume fish oil every day - either by eating oily fish or taking supplements. \nBut the Heart Foundation updated its recommendation in a 2015 update of its position statement, saying there was insufficient evidence to support the use of fish oil supplements in preventing heart attack. \nAnd if you're wondering — experts say there's no real difference between the quality of omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil capsules versus liquid fish oil. \nThe University of Sydney's Dr Joanna Harnett, who specialises in complementary medicines, said the distinction is that liquid fish oil can contain a higher amount of omega-3 fatty acids in a smaller dose compared to a capsule. \n\"It depends on the quality of the product too, not all fish oils are the same. You might be able to get more essential fatty acids from a liquid formula,\" she said. Vitamin C \nVitamin C is an essential nutrient that helps grow and repair the tissue in the human body, acts as an antioxidant, and prevents scurvy — which some doctors say is on the rise thanks to poor dietary health among the population. \nYou can get vitamin C by eating kale, citrus fruits, berries and peas. Many of us take it as a supplement to treat a cold, but there's really little evidence to support its use. \nA review of 65 trials in 2013 , some of which looked at whether the risk of a cold was reduced by taking vitamin C and others that looked at whether it affected cold duration, found vitamin C doesn't reduce the number of colds in a group of people, but that some evidence indicated supplementing your diet with vitamin C reduced the duration of a cold. \nThe analysis also pointed out the low cost of the supplement, its relative safety for consumption, and its possible effect on cold duration meant it could be worthwhile for people to take it if they felt it reduced their illness. Glucosamine \nAnother popular supplements is glucosamine, a building block of cartilage. These supplements are derived from crab, lobster or shrimp shells. \nStudies haven't been able to prove that glucosamine is an effective treatment for osteoarthritis: A 2005 review found a particular type of glucosamine, crystalline glucosamine sulfate, combined with chondroitin went some way to improving pain and function in test subjects. A 2010 meta-analysis of 10 large-scale randomised controlled trials found no evidence the supplement was better than a placebo. An Australian study published in 2014 showed that people taking a combination of glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate over two years reduced the amount of joint space narrowing (an early symptom of osteoarthritis) compared to those taking a placebo. This wasn't linked to a reduction in symptoms compared to those taking the placebo. \nRheumatologist Sam Whittle, from Queen Elizabeth Hospital in South Australia, said the weight of evidence doesn't really support the use of glucosamine. \n\"If we look now at the totality of evidence over all the studies that have been performed, and there have been a lot, it's debatable. But my reading of the evidence is that there's probably no effect of glucosamine on pain, and probably no effect on structure,\" he said. \nDr Whittle said people could still try glucosamine if they wanted as it was relatively safe, but warned that the supplement was also expensive. \n\"I don't object to people trialling it because I consider it to be safe, I don't necessarily recommend it to people, but if people ask me whether they can try it I don't object to it. What I usually say is to give it a three-month trial, and if you haven't improved significantly in that time then stop it,\" he said. Herbal medicines \nHerbal medicines include supplements derived from plants in some way — such as St John's wort (used to treat depression) and echinacea (used for colds). \nThey're less popular than other forms of supplements, but are still commonly used in Australia. Complementary medicines herbal tease \nThe regulation of herbal products in Australia remains relatively lax, medical experts have found. \n\"People seem to feel that those complementary medicines are safer or less harmful than prescription medicines and a safer alternative. More natural is often a term we hear consumers use on our Medicines Line service,\" Ms Spagnardi said. \n\"But we still feel there's a general gap in understanding that they are medicines and they can be harmful in the worst scenario.\" \nLast week, medical experts called for herbal remedies to be independently tested, after uncovering some remedies available in the Australian market that contained natural toxins, heavy metals, or pesticides. \n\"A significant number of traditional herbal medicines do not comply with Australian regulations,\" said the co-author of the review at the time, Ian Musgrave from the University of Adelaide. \n\"In some cases, ingredients are either not listed or their concentrations are recorded inaccurately on websites or labels.\" \nLast year Western Australian man Matthew Whitby lost his liver — most likely the result of taking a protein powder that included a green tea extract. \nIt's since emerged that herbal supplements have been linked to at least six Australian organ transplants since 2011 , and many commonly used dietary supplements have been linked to kidney damage. Cranberry \nCranberry, as juice, tablets or capsules, has long been used to treat, and prevent, urinary tract infections. \nWhile some lab studies have found cranberries can prevent E. coli (which causes many UTIs) from sticking in the urinary tract, human studies haven't demonstrated the supplement's effectiveness . \nA 2012 review of studies found no benefit in cranberry juice or supplements, while a 2016 study that used a higher dose of the active ingredient in its cranberry supplement again found it didn't make a difference — the treatment was no better than a placebo. \nWith that said, cranberry juice could still be helping treat a UTI. Water and other fluids help prevent UTIs by \"flushing out\" the urinary system, and if you're drinking lots of cranberry juice, it could be having a similar effect to drinking lots of water. \nAssociate Professor Jutani-Mehta, the co-author of the 2016 study, told RN's Health Report the juice could also have anti-inflammatory properties not fully understood by science. \n\"Many women will tell me that it works for them. And for those who tell me that, I say continue using it. There is little downside to doing that,\" she said. \nShe did, however, caution against the use of capsules or tablets.
