Photo: Supplied \n\"I still cannot believe how this could be happening. I cry every time I think she has to leave,\" Dr Haque said. \n\"My children have been doing well in school, they have a lot of friends. I'm working in two practices, I have a lot of patients … I have been doing everything I can, hoping to have a good result.\" Advertisement \nDr Haque and her son Sakir, 14, have the option of remaining in Australia on temporary visas or leaving with Sumaya for Hungary, where the family are citizens and where her husband, also a doctor, still lives. \nNeither Dr Haque nor her children speak Hungarian. Moving to Hungary would mean significant disruption to the children's education and, for Dr Haque, giving up work - hard-won after years studying English and completing the requirements to have her medical qualifications recognised in Australia. \nIt would also mean leaving their extended family - Dr Haque's mother and father, who currently live with them, and her sister and brother, who are all Australian citizens. \nIt's an impossible decision, Dr Haque said. \"I cannot imagine how I will live without my daughter … I don't actually know what I will do.\" \nPresident of the NSW branch of the Australian Medical Association Brad Frankum said the decision was \"disgraceful\". \n\"It would take someone of immense callousness to split a family because one of the children is on the autism spectrum,\" Professor Frankum said. \n\"This family's human rights are being violated … The fact that an Australian resident of eight years, whose parents and siblings live here, can be faced with deportation due to illness is reprehensible.\" \nAutism is a developmental disorder that affects about one in 100 children. \nUnder section 351 of the Migration Act 1958, the Assistant Minister has the power to intervene in immigration decisions if he or she thinks it is in the public interest to do so. \nA spokesman for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said a person could request intervention, \"however the Minister cannot be compelled to exercise his powers and he is not required to explain his decisions on any case.\" \n\"What is or is not in the public interest is entirely a matter for the Minister, considering each case on its own merits,\" the spokesman told Fairfax Media. \n\"The Assistant Minister only intervenes in a relatively small number of cases which present unique and exceptional circumstances.\" \nProfessor Frankum said Dr Haque's ability to stay in Australia and continue caring for her community was \"of immense public interest\". \n\"She's been doing a very valuable job for the community. If she leaves, the public will be worse off for it. \nAutism Awareness Australia chief executive Nicole Rogerson said the decision to deport Sumaya was \"incredibly offensive\" to Australians with disabilities and their families. \n\"It sends a terrible message about what disability means in this country ... The parents have done nothing but contribute to our country, yet apparently the scourge of this disability, this disabled child, is so bad we have to deport the entire family,\" she said. \n\"I ask Alex Hawke, if he's got small children of his own, what particular message is he trying to teach them about how we treat difference and disability in this country? \n\"It's appalling and it's heartless.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:37:59.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
