Also next week happens to be salary time, so the regular remitters would be sending money home,” Manghat added. \nThe US dollar has been putting pressure on a number of currencies, as expectations of a rate increase are again building up. \nAnalysts have said there is a high probability that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in the US, which sets the interest rates that banks use to lend each other, will make another adjustment at its meeting in March. \nUS Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen signalled another rate increase this year amid a good economic situation and a strong employment sector. \nDavid Kohl, chief currency strategist and head economist for Germany at Julius Baer, said the American currency is likely to strengthen further in the months to come. \nHe said they believe that there is a high probability that the FOMC could increase the Fed funds target rate to 0.75 to 1 per cent at its next meeting on March 15. \n“The acknowledgment of the good economic backdrop and a solid labour market show the Fed’s determination to increase interest rates. The hints that the US economy can deal very well with somewhat higher interest rates are an additional sign of the central bank’s readiness,” said Kohl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:27:36.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
