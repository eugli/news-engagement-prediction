The 7th and 8th most spoken languages Gujarati and Kannada, including the 12th most spoken language Assamese have been given as options of medium for appearing in the entrance exam but Urdu which is at the 6th has been excluded. A + A - Photo for representation: Reuters \nStudents Islamic Organisation in their petition says that they are pained to know that the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has decided to conduct the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET-UG) for the Academic Year 2017-18 in 10 languages but has kept the Urdu out of this important test. \nIt seems to be a selective discrimination of particular language by the ministry even after several representations. \nIn terms of number of people speaking a language, Urdu ranks sixth in India as per the census report. Also, Urdu is one the languages listed in Schedule VIII of the Indian Constitution. A large number of students study science in Urdu Medium for their 11th and 12th class exams. \nNCERT text books for 11th and 12th class are available in Urdu, when such text books are not available in several other languages such as Kannada. \nThe seventh most spoken language Gujarati, eighth most spoken language Kannada, tenth most spoken Language Oriya, and twelfth most spoken language Assamese have been given as options of medium for appearing in the said entrance exam but Urdu which is at the sixth rank has been arbitrarily excluded. \nA large number of students study science in Urdu Medium in States of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana etc, despite several state governments making specific requests to the Union Health Ministry to include Urdu as a medium for National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test 2017, Urdu has arbitrarily and unreasonably left out as a medium for the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test 2017. \nSIO also says in their petition that they feel that exclusion of Urdu as a medium is highly detrimental to students across the country who received their secondary and higher secondary education in Urdu. They are suddenly confronted with having to either appear in language which they did not undertake their secondary education in or not appear at all. \nLeaving out Urdu as a medium not only deprives a large number of students studying science in Urdu Medium of equal opportunity, but is also a violation of right to life, being denied the opportunity to pursue a career in Health Sciences and shape their lives as per their choices and interests.
