It simplifies the process for police, health services and loved ones to force those locked in a cycle of substance abuse into compulsory treatment. \nBut Wellington addiction clinician Roger Brooking said is was unclear whether the health sector could cope with a spike in rehab patients given there were only four approved centres across the country, and those centres were already full. FAIRFAX NZ \nDrug and alcohol counsellor Roger Brooking says this country needs more rehab centres before it can treat more addicts. \n\"If somebody tried to get someone treated under that act now, I have no idea where they would go.\" \nREAD MORE: \nThe new law allows any third party to apply for a person to have compulsory treatment, but it must be signed off by an approved specialist. The law specifies addicts can only be held up to 16 weeks. CAMERON BURNELL/FAIRFAX NZ \nLawyer Michael Bott says involuntary treatment for drug addicts should only be used as a last resort. \nIt replaces the Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Act (1966), which contained provisions for compulsory treatment. \nBut because addicts could be held for six months under the old law, the option was rarely exercised because it was at odds with the Bill of Rights. \nDr Vanessa Caldwell, from the National Committee for Addiction Treatment and addictions workforce agency Matua Raki, said more addicts would likely end up getting treatment under the new law. \nBut whether more beds would be found at treatment centres was not entirely clear. Ad Feedback \n\"That's a little bit unknown ... but DHBs have been planning to meet that need.\" \nAbout 100 addicts are already detained in compulsory treatment in this country. There are four approved centres - in Auckland, Wellington, Dunedin and Christchurch - but only two are accepting new patients, Caldwell said. \nPatients detained under the new act would not be locked up, she said. \n\"We don't really have access to locked facilities in New Zealand. When we talk about 'detained' it means they're there when they don't want to be.\" \nIn 2015, Christchurch woman Louise Litchfield spoke of her two failed attempts to get help for her 28-year-old daughter's methamphetamine and codeine-based drug addiction under the 1966 act. \nA judge declined her request both times, as her daughter successfully defended herself. Litchfield gave up a third time. \n\"One judge told me I was trying to take away my daughter's freedom and I was offending the Human Rights Act,\" she said. \nCivil liberties lawyer Michael Bott said involuntary treatment should be used as a last resort in cases where voluntary methods had failed. \n\"Chemical addictions are huge and powerful and corrupt someone's rational thinking.\" \nBut he believed a chronic underfunding of alcohol and drug treatment programmes was also a problem that needed addressing, as many failed to address the root cause. \n\"There are multi-facted reasons for people turning to alcohol and until we realise that ... all we're going to be doing is parking ambulances at the bottom of the cliff.\" \nTHE CRITERIA FOR COMPULSORY TREATMENT \n* Any third party can apply for a person to receive compulsory treatment, but it must be signed off by a specialist. \n* The patient must have a severe substance addiction and their capacity to make informed decisions about treatment must be severely impaired. \n* Appropriate treatment must be available, meaning there needs to be capacity at a detox facility. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:05:54.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
