Source: \nâ€” Adam Van Unen (@muffo80) February 4, 2017 \nPyrotechnics returned to the A-League on Saturday night, but fans were to quick to retaliate. \nThey detained and handed over to police a man who allegedly ignited a flare outside the venue after Victory's controversial 2-1 win over City. \nPolice also identified and arrested another man on the same grounds, while a third was arrested over a damaged seat inside the stadium. \nThe trio are expected to be charged. \nFFA confirmed they had the identities of the flare-ripping perpetrators and would begin the process to have them banned from games. \nThe governing body saw no reason to punish Victory for the individual troublemaking and said it would not activate the threat of a points deduction due to prior poor behaviour from the club's fans. \nNo flares were seen inside Etihad, while 11 people were evicted from a crowd of 35,426. \nPeople said they were \"happy with the behaviour of the overwhelming majority of the crowd during the match\".
