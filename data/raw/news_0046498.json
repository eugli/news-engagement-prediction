For another, both ran on a campaign that promised, among others, to “Build the wall”!\nLuckily, the similarities end there.\nIn fact, the recently elected mayor of Kapiti Coast couldn’t be more of an antithesis of everything Trump: the 63-year-old K. Gurunathan is an ethnic minority in New Zealand and an immigrant – he’s a proud anak Malaysia born in Penang. He’s also a former journalist.\nAnd the wall Gurunathan promised to build?\nIt is part of his environmental conservation plan to keep out big ocean waves and storms and protect Kapiti Coast from coastal erosion.\n“I just rode on Donald Trump’s ‘popularity’,” he jokes.\nIn person, Gurunathan appears coolly collected and down-to-earth. He seems even embarrassed by all the attention he is getting in Malaysia for his win in Kapiti Coast.\n“I remember the publicity I got in Malaysia after I won (in October last year), I was so surprised,” he remarks to Sunday Star when visiting Menara Star in Petaling Jaya recently.\n“First of all, Kapiti is not Chicago, New York, London or Sydney.... It is where Peter Jackson shot the Lord Of The Rings movies but it is still just a provincial town near Wellington. Second, I have been away from Malaysia for more than 22 years.\nClose to paradise: The beautiful scenery along Kapiti Coast where Gurunathan (inset) is mayor. Being brought up in multiethnic Malaysia has helped the transplanted Penangite deal with the increasingly diverse town he now leads. — 123rf.com/SHAARI CHEMAT/The Star  \n“On these two grounds, it should have been insignificant, but for some reason my win caught people’s attention here.”\nWhen he asked, he was told many Malaysians were proud to see their countryman becoming a mayor in a Commonwealth country, especially at a time when “immigrant” is getting a bad rep in the world.\n“I realised that my win, regardless of how minor it is, is good news for many at a time with a growing global angst over migration. It gives them satisfaction that there is a growth or change, no matter how small it is.\n“Globally, the movement of people from less developed countries to the more developed countries is growing, and there’s a lot of angst over this.\n“So for me to have won a local election in a place like Kapati which has a predominantly Caucasian population, it shows that despite the differences they have accepted me.”\nGurunathan hopes it can help change the global perception on emigration and immigrants, and goes on to share a message he got from a Malaysian couple that emigrated to Australia.\n“They had read about me; in their letter, the wife said her son has always said that he wants to be the Prime Minister of Australia one day, and now she can truly say to him that it is possible to dream big,” he recalls. \nGurunathan says he could not have won without the Kapati folks’ trust, something he feels he has earned with his strong track record as a two-term councillor since 2010.\nAs he sees it, ethnicity was secondary. Meritocracy was more important. \n“I feel that ethnicity has played at many levels in the local elections, it is an issue at subliminal levels, but the overriding factor is really the individual that matters – the individual performance and name recognition override the prejudices most of the time.”\nGurunathan not only beat the incumbent mayor but also four other candidates for the mayoral seat. \nInterestingly, he says his journalistic background played a crucial role in his win.\n“If I was a complete unknown or even marginally unknown, I don’t think I could have won, but my experience as a journalist helped – people knew my name and many have seen me around town,” he says.\nGurunathan has a long history with the Malaysian media, starting off as chief reporter in 1983 with the now defunct Penang-based The National Echo . He then became the editor of DAP’s party paper The Rocket before contributing to the New Straits Times as a political commentator. He had just been made the special features editor at The Sun in 1995 when he got news that his father-in-law in New Zealand had fallen seriously ill.\n“My wife, who is a Kiwi, and I decided to pack up and head for New Zealand with our children. It was difficult, but what could we do?” he shares.\nAfter settling in Wellington, Gurunathan worked for a local community paper, The Kapiti Observer , until 2008, when he joined the Kapiti News as a columnist . In 2010, he became a local councillor in Kapiti. \n“I never thought I would join politics. As a journalist you are an observer of politics, not a participant. And people always ask me, how do you transit from being a journalist to a politician?”\nHis explanation begins with the words of the respected war correspondent Robert Fisk.\n“When Fisk was asked about the role of a journalist, he said the role of journalists is to monitor the centre of power.\n“In New Zealand, the local government act says – and this is the principle of governance – all local authorities should conduct their activities in an open and transparent and publicly accountable manner.\n“That is like ‘monitoring’, so that’s why I didn’t see any conflict between being a journalist and a politician, and I ran on the platform for councils to be open, transparent and democratically accountable.”\nIn the last four months since he took office, Gurunathan says he has been busy knitting back together the Kapiti council, which was previously politically divided. \nAnd here, his Malaysian background has come in handy. \nOne is his experience working in the Malaysian political scene, especially with DAP.\n“In Malaysia, the politics is multilevel – you have the politics of the haves and have-nots in terms of economic wealth, and we weave that into the politics of race. \n“So the political game is not a normal chess board, it’s a multilevel chessboard and you have to be able to play at the different levels,” he says.\n“You can say I was the ‘opposition leader’ when I was a councillor in Kapiti. My role then was to challenge the establishment. But when I became mayor, I became the establishment, and had to learn to work with the ‘other side’, especially the chief executive of the council and the 320 staff (hired by the chief executive) to get things done.\n“Being the opposition leader is one thing and being the mayor is another thing.”\nAnother valuable political tactic that helped him, he says, he ‘learnt’ from former MIC president Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu.\n“I remembered in the 1990s, the DAP candidate in Ipoh came ranting and raving into the office one day. When we asked what was the problem, he said, ‘This Samy Vellu, he has influenced all the barbers with MIC propaganda, and those barbers have influenced their customers, who then spread MIC politics to their families and friends.’ \n“I thought it was ingenious! So last year, when we embarked on an emergency preparedness campaign after a major earthquake in the Wellington area, I decided to recruit all the hairdressers in Kapiti. It helped cut our publicity budget,” he recalls gleefully.\nAs a vocal critic of Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad when he was a journalist and DAP communications officer, Gurunathan is, however, not too surprised by the former premier’s “turnabout”.\n“As they say, there are no eternal winners or losers in politics. And there are no eternal enemies. Politics has the ability to create the strangest bedfellows. That’s the art of politics,” he quips. \nThe other element that has proved to be useful in his political career as well as in life in his adopted country, says Gurunathan, is Malaysia’s multicultural essence, which shaped him growing up. \n“In Malaysia, each race has a cultural paradigm, and to be able to meet the differences is essential. So my experience of working with the different communities and bringing them together has taught me how to do that in the increasingly diverse environment I am in now.” \nHe says while he is happy to see political maturity growing in Malaysia with the strong participation of the Opposition in Malaysian Parliament and state governments since 2008, he is alarmed by the growth of fundamentalism here.\n“True, it is a global trend as we are seeing in Europe, Trump’s America and Britain.... And it is in all religions – we have Christian fundamentalists, Muslim fundamentalists, and Buddhist fundamentalists.\n“Whatever the religion or origin, fundamentalists are inflexible, legalistic and exclusive – they exclude people who are different from them. \n“As a former Malaysian – I had to give up my Malaysian citizenship to get a New Zealand citizenship even though it was very painful – it saddens me to see this fundamentalism seeping into Malaysian society and dividing the people. It is not healthy.\n“Inclusion and the fusion of different cultures are Malaysia’s unique strengths and we cannot lose that. Not with the uncertainties in the world today,” Gurunathan warns.\n“We need to preserve these core values if we want to safely chart the stormy waters ahead in the world.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:47:11.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
