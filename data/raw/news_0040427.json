The Port Washington-based company will set up shop in the former Roger Stevens Menswear space at the Pfister Hotel , said the company's president and CEO Paul Grangaard . Allen Edmonds, known for its upscale leather men's shoes, will open the store in time for the U.S. Open golf tournament at Erin Hills this summer, he said. Allen Edmonds will open a retail location in the former Roger Stevens store space in the… more Sara Stathas Photographer The company now operates 69 stores in the country and its closest locations to Milwaukee are in Port Washington, Brookfield and Mequon. With all the development and new buildings rising from the ground in the heart of the city, Allen Edmonds also wanted to be an active participant, Grangaard said. \"There's a renaissance that’s going on in downtown Milwaukee and it's very exciting,\" he said. \"We wanted to be a part of it.” The new store will be located on the corner of Jefferson Street and Wisconsin Avenue, in proximity to the new Northwestern Mutual office tower and other development. With all that construction happening in the surrounding blocks, Grangaard anticipates that the corner has a \"higher profile\" than before. \"It’s a nice complement to all the things happening in downtown Milwaukee,” he said. That the shop is located in the Pfister Hotel also presents a unique opportunity for Allen Edmonds, which has expanded its product line beyond shoes and branched into apparel. Travelers often forget a piece of clothing or accessory, and thus Allen Edmonds can help people fill in their wardrobe, Grangaard said. The downtown shop is going to be larger than a typical Allen Edmonds location and the company plans to treat it as a sort-of \"laboratory store\" to experiment, he said. \"It will give us an opportunity to carry a more complete offering of both shoes and above-the-ankle products,\" he said. Over the past few years, Allen Edmonds has expanded its retail store footprint, opening between nine and 11 locations on an annual basis. The Wisconsin business in 2017 also plans to extend its presence to Seattle and Miami. In December, Allen Edmonds Shoe Corp. changed hands when Missouri-based Calares Inc. purchased the Wisconsin company for $255 million from the Los Angeles-based private equity firm Brentwood Associates.
