If drones can handle some of those deliveries, the company can be more efficient along those areas and lower some costs, Dodero said. He declined to say whether the company's workforce could be trimmed by attrition as UPS expands drone delivery. The company has conducted drone tests before, and is weighing other uses for the technology, such as in inventory control and helping inspect planes and vehicles within hangars and warehouses UPS has no timeline for when drones might be put into wider use, Dodero said, partly because federal authorities are still developing regulations on how to use the technology 'We have no idea how all that will play out until we find out how to integrate them into the business,' he said. However, Dodero added UPS is not looking to use drones as a replacement for drivers. 'UPS is never looking to replace our UPS drivers,' he said, calling them 'the face of our company.' Cities are dense enough that drivers typically have deliveries grouped relatively close together. But rural routes are more spread out, and thus more expensive. If drones can handle some of those deliveries, the company can be more efficient along those areas AMAZON'S DRONE SERVICE COULD MAKE DELIVERIES FASTER Impatient shoppers will be pleased to hear that Amazon's drones could significantly speed up the speed at which deliveries can be made. The plan is for Amazon's PrimeAir service to eventually deliver small packages weighing up to 5lbs (2.27kg) in 30 minutes or less. Amazon got British approval for three new types of tests, including flying drones that are no longer within sight of their operators in rural and suburban areas. The other two are having one person operate several highly automated drones and testing devices to make the drones able to identify and avoid obstacles. During the test the drones will be only allowed to fly an altitude of 400ft (122m) and kept away from operating near airport flight paths. In December, Amazon Air carried out its first drone delivery from its testing site near Cambridge to a farmhouse just 765 yards away. The package contained an Amazon Fire TV box and a bag of popcorn, and was dropped off just 13 minutes after it was ordered. Amazon's US billionaire founder Jeff Bezos confirmed the delivery in a tweet earlier that week and posted a video. 'First-ever AmazonPrimeAir customer delivery is in the books,’ Bezos wrote. ‘13 min - click to delivery.'
