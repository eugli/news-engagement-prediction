Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA first-time mother has told of her heartbreak after having a late-term abortion and slammed Donald Trump over his position on the issue. \nLindsey Paradiso bravely shared her story in response to the US president's controversial comments, and said governments should stop interfering with a woman's right to choose. \nThe 28-year-old said she and her husband, Matt, were forced to make the heartbreaking decision to have an abortion at 23 weeks because their daughter, Omara, was likely to die in the womb. \nA tumour on the baby's neck tripled in size as time passed and was growing all over her body, leaving her with just a 1% chance of survival. Lindsey shared heartbreaking photos of the couple holding their daughter (Photo: Facebook / Lindsey Paradiso) Their daughter was given just a 1% chance of survival (Photo: Facebook / Lindsey Paradiso) \nLindsey revealed her heartbreak in a Facebook post that went viral after Trump discussed late-term abortions during a televised debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton last October.

This is late-term abortion. \n\"It was not wanted. It was not a 'way out'. \n\"It was not birth control. It was heartbreaking. \n\"The government does not belong here.\" A Facebook post described how the couple's excitement turned to devastation (Photo: Facebook / Lindsey Paradiso) Omara's hand and footprints after she was delivered (Photo: Facebook / Lindsey Paradiso) \nLindsey first learned there were problems with her pregnancy at 18 weeks. \nA mass on her daughter's neck was discovered during an ultrasound, and it was believed to be a tumour called teratoma.

Lindsey shared photos from her pregnancy (Photo: Facebook / Lindsey Paradiso) \nShe was induced after a lethal injection was administered to the baby. She was in labour for 40 hours but was determined to hold her daughter so the couple could say goodbye. \nThey held a funeral service for their daughter days later. \nHer Facebook and blog posts have been widely shared again this month. \nShe wrote on her blog: \"I think oftentimes we forget that the loss of these babies doesn't only affect the parents, but it affects their friends and family members. \n\"When politicians like Trump and [Vice President Mike] Pence spread their intolerance for giving women a choice, we make these very difficult situations so much more difficult for not just the mother, but everyone involved.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:52:24.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
