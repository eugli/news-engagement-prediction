Scott Walker said he’s considering seeking a third term in 2018, but wouldn’t be weighing the option if former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had won the election.\nWalker — who was first elected in 2010, won his recall election in 2012 and a second term in 2014 — said he doesn’t believe he would be able to accomplish his policy goals under an administration with no solid understanding of states’ rights.\n“Well, I’ll make an announcement if my budget is done early this summer, but for me I can tell you unequivocally if Hillary Clinton was the president, I would not have run again,” he told The Daily Caller News Foundation Thursday. “Because we’ve done so much in the state, most of which we can do next, if I were to take another term and earn the support of the people of Wisconsin, would really require the federal government restoring some of the rights and responsibilities back to the states.”\nWalker said he expects GOP governors to largely have a positive relationship with President Donald Trump, and looks forward to the role Vice President Mike Pence will play in working with the states due to his gubernatorial experience.\n“I mean, Mike Pence, personally to me is a great long-time friend, but to all of our governors is someone who up until a month-and-a-half ago was a colleague and someone who really gets the states,” he said. “And I think appropriately understands the appropriate balance that our founders intended — the very limited powers would be focused in Washington, the rest would be sent back to the states and more importantly the people.”\nWATCH:\n\nThe Republican Governors Association, which Walker chairs, is set to meet over the course of the weekend. Walker said in addition to policy discussions on issues like Obamacare and Medicaid reform, they will also discuss upcoming elections.\n“We always talk about elections, so we’re getting ready for not just this year, but next year,” he said. “Thirty-six races for governor, 26 are Republican held, 15 of those are term-limited and 11 are like me who can run again. So certainly we’re looking ahead at the horizon.”\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter \nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
