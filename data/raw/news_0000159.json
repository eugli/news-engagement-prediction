The #BoycottStarbucks campaign has resonated on social media, but it could bring out the company’s supporters, as well. By Feb. 1, 2017 10:18 a.m. ET Text Size Medium Large Starbucks is dealing with plenty of problems, but a boycott might not become one of them. Photo: Getty Images \nStarbucks has a number of big issues on its plate -- its CEO is stepping down , it has a very ambitious growth plan , and it can’t keep up with all the mobile orders people are placing. These could end up causing problems for the company. But investors likely don’t have to worry about recent calls from Trump supporters to boycott the chain. \nThe #BoycottStarbucks hashtag cropped up earlier this week after Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced that the company would hire 10,000 refugees within five years, a response to President Trump’s executive order banning refugees. \n“Social data suggests Boycott Starbucks could be the biggest boycott of a public company in five years,” wrote TickerTags analyst Daria Woods in a report this week. (TickerTags tracks mentions of key terms on social media outlets like Twitter and looks for potential stock impacts.) \nBut, go figure, a boycott doesn’t have to be all bad. Woods also notes that it’s possible news of the movement brought Starbucks defenders out in full force. There was no change in the frequency of social mentions from people who said they “ordered” Starbucks or “got” Starbucks in the immediate period after the boycott campaign started. \nIn other words, a company making headlines for a political statement could bring out activists on both sides of the issue. “Many consumers claim that the statement made them more likely to go to Starbucks,” Woods wrote. \nIt’s hard to tell, even after the fact, what impact such boycotts have on sales. Last year, customers arranged to boycott Target due to the retailer’s stance on transgender bathroom policies. The company later noted that it would be “difficult to tease out one thing that’s driving results” but also said that fallout from the bathroom policy had “really not been material,” per the Washington Post. \nThe biggest social media mention of boycotting in the last five years came this past summer, according to TickerTags, when the Hamilton musical cast made a speech about diversity to then-vice presidential nominee Mike Pence after he came to see the show. Pence supporters said they’d boycott. But the popular musical is as sold out as ever. \nBig Picture: The movement by Donald Trump’s supporters to stop going to Starbucks may be the biggest boycott of a public company in years, social media data show. But news of the boycott seems to be energizing Starbucks’ defenders, too.
