He was pronounced dead after hospital staffers found him. \nWe're told someone told police Daveigh had been hanging out with the guy in the hours before his death. When cops ran her name, they found an outstanding warrant, and arrested her early Wednesday. \nOur sources say Daveigh -- who was also the creepy chick in \" The Ring \" -- is NOT a suspect in the man's death. We're told cops are treating it as a possible overdose, and Daveigh says she was merely trying to get him help at the hospital.
