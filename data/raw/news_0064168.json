Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #transgender rghts ❤ \n— jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 23, 2017 \nIn a Wednesday morning interview on “Today” with her 18-year-old sister, Juliet, Evancho said she would use the meeting to “ enlighten him on what my sister goes through every single day in school, and people just like her, what they deal with, the discrimination, it’s terrible.” \nJuliet said at her high school, where the bathroom policies for trans students are unclear, “I kind of live it every day.” \n“I’ve had things thrown at me. I’ve had people say pretty horrible things,” she told George Stephanopoulos. “The unsafe environment is just very unhealthy. I feel like Donald Trump needs to know that being in such an unsafe environment won’t do any good for the transgender and LGBT community but as well as everyone as a whole.” Inauguration singer Jackie Evancho & her transgender sister have a message for Trump: \"I want to enlighten him.\" pic.twitter.com/NpePhaeZyX \n— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) February 23, 2017 \nWell said. \nHowever, when asked if she would choose to perform at Trump’s inauguration again despite his anti-trans policy, Jackie replied, “most definitely,” because the performance was “not about politics.” Story Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:16:32.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
