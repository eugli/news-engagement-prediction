Inside Those Model Hair Transformations February 12, 2017 3:19 AM 1 / 6 Catherine McNeil Photo: Yannis Vlamos / Indigital.tv \"I think we OD-ed on color last season,\" Guido Palau observed with a grin. The editorial hairstylist was backstage at Alexander Wang 's Fall 2017 show where, instead of sitting for a series of eye-piercing dye jobs, the designer's model cast had undergone another kind of transformation—in the form of a handful of subversive boy cuts, made cool once again. It called back to the early '90s, Palau explained, when the tomboy first came into fashion. Model Catherine McNeil, for instance, received a modern variation of Linda Evangelista 's career-making chop—a move that required the Australian beauty to shed more than a foot of brunette waves for the occasion. \"That was great to reinterpret on Cat,\" Palau said, pointing toward her dark slept-in strands, rumpled with Redken's Wax Blast. \"There's an unkempt kind of glamour to the hair.\" Nearby, Irina Kravchenko spun back and forth with a classic version of a bowl, cut from her chest-grazing strands two days ago in Wang's showroom. \"Actually, my agent told me they just wanted my hair a bit brighter,\" she said. \"When I was already at the studio, they told me 'Irina, we want to cut your hair,' and I said . . . Okay, why not?\" South African newcomer Nina Milner wore a slightly more masculine riff on the style's distinctive proportions, while models Kennah and Sora Choi submitted to the shears in the service of a pair of mushroom-topped mullets. But it was Wang first-timer Sohyun Jung who stole the show with a hybrid flat top-meets-barbershop crop that only served to highlight her spectacular bone structure. This season, less is officially more. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:55:59.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
