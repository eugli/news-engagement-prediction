(Photo: Jay Biggerstaff, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nOn the same day that the Pittsburgh Steelers ensured one of their offensive stars would be kept under wraps, the team also made a deal to give another one top dollar. \nThe Steelers reached a four-year, $68 million extension with Antonio Brown that makes the wide receiver the highest-paid at his position, a person familiar with the deal's terms told USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the financial aspects of the contract had not been announced. \nBrown had one year remaining on his existing contract. Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green previously held the high for the position with $15 million average per year. \nBrown confirmed the deal on Twitter by posting an image of himself with agent Drew Rosenhaus and the caption \"Steelers for life #Boomin\" attached. The team also announced the extension. \nEarlier on Monday, the Steelers placed the exclusive franchise tag on running back Le'Veon Bell. \nPHOTOS: Best potential NFL free agents Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
