We trip over ourselves and it's hard to plan and move with purpose,\" Dr Hassed said. \nThe benefits of mindfulness include improved attention and memory, reduced stress and better health. It can even lower disruptive and bullying behaviour in schools. Helping kids be in the moment \nDr Hassed says there are two key reasons mindfulness is so important for kids. \n\"Firstly when we're not mindful it is very easy to slip into worry mode and get anxious about the future or the past. Our thinking becomes vulnerable to worry and rumination,\" he said. \n\"Kids who are getting anxious about school are often worrying about a future that hasn't happened.\" How to be mindful Don't multi-task: focus on what you are doing at any one the time Avoid distraction: practise being in the present moment Limit screen time especially social media and gaming Practise regularly until it becomes a habit \nThe other key reason for kids to practice mindfulness, according to Dr Hassed, is that if a child cannot engage their attention effectively they will not learn well. \n\"Children who have a poor ability to engage and sustain attention at four are 50 per cent less likely to graduate from college at 25.\" \nDr Hassed says the great enemies of mindfulness are multi-tasking and distraction, by-products of too much screen time, particularly in children. \nHe says students who have a few minutes of mindfulness practice prior to a class will understand more and retain more information, and are more likely to engage with their study right across the board. Making minds smile \nAustralian not-for-profit organisation Smiling Mind has developed a series of guided mediations to help families and teachers learn mindfulness.

There can be a lot of stimulation,\" Dr Wootten said. \n\"Going back into a classroom setting with new kids and perhaps new teachers is absolutely a time to practise mindfulness.\" \nShe says recent research shows practising mindfulness provides kids with the capability to make better decisions and provides self-awareness. \n\"We found after practising mindfulness there were big improvements in the quality of kids' sleep, improvements in behaviour and engagement at school, as well as children's safety at school.\" \n\"Teachers reported their classrooms were much less disruptive and there was less bullying.\" Putting it into practice \nDr Hassed says there are two main ways you can practice mindfulness. \nFormal practice is taking the time to sit and meditate in a quiet space, closing eyes and using techniques to focus on the breath or scan attention over the body. Listen to guided meditations for parents, kids, teenagers, uni students and teachers. \nInformal practice is what we do throughout the day as we go about our lives — making a coffee, washing dishes, eating, or walking from A to B — while being mindful of our actions, paying attention to them, and not being on auto-pilot. \nDr Hassed says the best thing parents can do to help children adopt mindfulness is to commit to the practice themselves. \n\"The more present and mindful you are with your children, the more happy, mindful and resilient they will be,\" he said. \nDr Wootten recommends parents make it fun, and practice as regularly as possible until it becomes part of a family's weekly or daily routine.
