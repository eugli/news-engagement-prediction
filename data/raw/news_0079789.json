So, what’s the point of banning corporal punishment in law? \nAlan Corbett said policies are not enough, and the law as it stands leaves it open for corporal punishment to be reintroduced in religious or independent schools. \n“Until such time they explicitly abolish the use of corporal punishment it’s open to [a] school to reintroduce it,” he said. \nIt was only in April 2016 the Christian Community Ministries Ltd (CCM) directed the 13 schools it owns across Australia to stop using corporal punishment. \nChristian Schools Australia, the peak body for independent Christian Schools, said it was not aware of the practice being used in schools or of any plans to introduce it. \n“Any change in the law which would prohibit the introduction of corporal punishment would not be an amendment we think would have any widespread opposition,” Executive Officer Mark Spencer said. \nMr Corbett has questioned why the Queensland government won’t rule out a “totally unprofessional and archaic” practice, and says it comes down to politics and religion. \n“The main reason it hasn’t changed is one of political will…I think here is a real religious streak amongst some politicians in the Queensland parliament which would prevent them from doing something [about it] because of fear of backlash they would get from some of their constituents,” he said. \nHe said his most recent letter to the Queensland Government in January 2017 has gone unanswered, as have his letters to One Nation Leader Pauline Hanson and Queensland Senator Malcolm Roberts. Queensland urged to follow the lead of South Australia \nThe Castan Centre for Human Rights Law wrote to the South Australian Government in November 2016 - the only other place in Australia besides Queensland that still sanctions corporal punishment. \nIt responded with a Draft Bill in January 2017 to explicitly prohibit the practice. \nQueensland has not followed suit. \n“I’d like to see Queensland follow the example of South Australia and draft legislation which very simply says any school in Queensland is not to use corporal punishment, it’s a very simple thing to do,” Mr Corbett said. \nHowever, there doesn’t appear to be any willingness from the Queensland Government to change the laws. \nA spokesperson for the Education Minister, Kate Jones, said in a statement to Hack the Government only determines behaviour management policy for state schools. \n\"Our schools should be safe and supportive learning environments for every student. \n“Queensland state schools have not used corporal punishment to manage student behaviour since 1995. The Palaszczuk Government has no plans to change that policy. \nBehaviour management policies for the non-state sector are determined by the relevant authorities – i.e. Queensland Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Schools Queensland.” \nMore than 20 years ago, New South Wales was the first jurisdiction in Australia to pass legislation ending the use of corporal punishment in both government and non-government schools.
