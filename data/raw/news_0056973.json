Anurag Basu spills the beans By Raghav Jaitly | Last Updated: Monday, February 20, 2017 - 14:35 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nNew Delhi: Fans of Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif are eagerly looking forward to 'Jagga Jasoos' which is slated to release on April 7. But,the makers of the film are concerned because board exams of secondary school children are usually scheduled in April, and the film's release in the same month could affect its collections at the Box Office. \nFilmmaker Basu, who has previously worked with Ranbir in 'Barfi!', is contemplating to change the release date of the film because 'Jagga Jasoos' is a fantasy- fiction primarily meant for family audiences. \nBasu took to Twitter on Monday to say that his team were thinking of postponing the movie's release. \n\"#JaggaJasoos is a Family Holiday film. Since exams r pushed at most of the places, We r contemplating the delay. Only IF v get a better Date,\" the 42-year-old filmmaker tweeted. #JaggaJasoos is a Family Holiday film Since exams r pushed at most of the places We r contemplating the delay Only IF v get a better Date \n— anurag basu (@basuanurag) 19 February 2017 But for now team is getting ready for 7th April. \n— anurag basu (@basuanurag) 20 February 2017 \nHe further posted on the social media, \"But for now team is getting ready for 7th April.\" Well, these are comforting words for fans who have been earnestly waiting to watch the already 'much delayed' film in April.
