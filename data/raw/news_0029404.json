I like them a lot. And friends speak, friends are open, friends are honest.” “So if at the end of the season I want one of their players or they want one of our players, we will not do it through the press. It is not through the press that we are going to exchange messages. We will be very direct.

I have nothing to say because I am not going to speak about hypothetical things.” For more from Chris when he's not writing on 90min, follow him on Twitter at @ThatChris1209 Reblog ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T03:40:16.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
