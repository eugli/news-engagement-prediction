He has now unexpectedly become a target for Barca after Aleix Vidal suffered a season ending ankle injury. \nAccording to AS , Barca originally made an approach for Eibar's Ander Capa, but were rebuffed after failing to trigger his 10m euros release clause. Now it is believed they will turn their attention to Juanfran and Malaga's Roberto Rosales. Credit: FC Barcelona \nBoth Luis Enrique and Barca's Sporting Director Robert Fernรกndez have admitted the need to bring in cover for Sergi Roberto, who has struggled on the right hand side of the Spanish champions' defence recently. \nJuanfran has been a first team regular for the duration of his long term loan at the Riazor, turning out 22 times for Deportivo this term. It is unlikely he will ever be given a chance at Vicarage Road, where the 28-year-old has never been needed since arriving from Real Betis three years ago. Juanfran could soon be assisting Neymar, rather than trying to stifle him. Image: PA \nThe Spanish full back has previously spent time with Getafe, Villareal B and Barca's El Clasico rivals Real Madrid, although he only made a solitary appearance for Los Blancos' first team during his time at the Bernabeu. \nIf Juanfran is good enough for Barca, the question must be asked as to why he's never figured in the first team plans of any Watford managers over the past three seasons?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:03:58.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
