The evidence suggests he’s not \nA mute, hearing-impaired refugee from Myanmar walking across metro-Denver light rail tracks Sunday afternoon was hit by a train and killed during a test of the R-Line. \nIt was the second time in a week that a man was killed by a Regional Transportation District train. \nAurora police, who went to the scene at 30th and Peoria around 2 p.m., determined that the 35-year-old man from Myanmar lived nearby and was crossing the RTD R-Lline tracks from west to east, police spokesman Lt. Mike McClelland said. \n“He was handicapped. He was hearing-impaired. He was apparently mute, as well,” McClelland said. \n“Apparently, he just didn’t see the lights. He didn’t hear it at all. He just pushed through the pedestrian gate. He just walked right in front of the train. It was a horrible accident.” \nRTD rail system operators were testing the train before a scheduled opening Friday. It carried no passengers Sunday, only a conductor, who stopped after the crash, authorities said. \nRTD officials said their warning system of flashing lights was functioning properly. Aurora police confirmed that flashing lights and bells worked properly. \n“He was crossing the tracks where he should have been. But he was not regarding the warning signs. He walked out into the intersection right in front of the train as it was approaching and was struck,” RTD spokesman Nate Currey said. \nAurora Fire Rescue crews responded and carried the man to a hospital. His name was not released. \nLast week, a man in a van was killed after pulling on front of an RTD commuter train. Aurora and RTD police officials on Sunday said that incident is still under investigation. Video reviewed by Aurora police shows a van stopped near the tracks before the train arrived. \n“The one from Tuesday we’re still working on. The video shows convincing evidence it was intentional,” McClelland said. \n“This one we don’t know.” Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:25:20.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
