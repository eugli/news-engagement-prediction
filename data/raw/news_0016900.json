(Photo: Josh Peter, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON – More than five hours ahead of Super Bowl LI, before the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons even arrived NRG Stadium, the anti-Trump protests kicked off. \nAt noon, about 500 people gathered for a march starting at Hermann Park. They broke into a loud chant, bellowing: “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has got to go.” \nLess than 30 feet away, 15 police officers on horseback were lined up, and a helicopter circled. The groups participating in the march that was scheduled to follow a two-mile route to the stadium included Black Lives Matter, the local Democratic party, the ACLU and the communist party, among others. \nAmong the protesters was Jane McEldowney, 62, a lawyer and licensed mental health professional from Houston. She said she began joining protests shortly after the presidential election in November. \nA 'Resist Trump\" banner at an anti-Trump protest.
