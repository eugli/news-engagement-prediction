Atarul is blind and last week, he joined the school as an Assistant Teacher. His nice behaviour has already won the hearts of his colleagues and parents alike. When it comes to teaching, Atarul reads aloud from the Braille edition of school text books while his students follow him in their printed edition books. Atarul reminiscences, \"I am blind and came from a very poor family. Since childhood, I'd stayed at the Helen Keller Vidyapith hostel. There I learnt the Brail language. I had to appoint a writer in the Madhyamik and Higher Secondary exams.\" Does he face any problem while teaching at the primary school? Atarul replies, \"Not at all! Everybody is very nice here.' Atarul's home is in Nadia district's Fulbari village. He was a student of Saktinagar High School at Krishnanagar, where he passed the Madhyamik and Higher Secondary exams. He then got admission at the Chapra Bangaljhi Maha Vidyalaya college and completed his Bachelor's in Arts. After graduation Atarul got admission at the Narendrapur Blind Boys' Academy. Simultaneously, he also cleared the TET Exams and got this job at the primary school. Pinaki Moitro, a parent, says, \"There were only 10 students in this school a few years ago. A few days ago, two new teachers joined the school and they've started to shape up the institution systematically. They have taken initiatives to decorate the school premises with flowers, plants and trees. The newly appointed Assistant Teacher is also nice and brilliant.\" Another parent, Sraboni Das said, \"When we come to collect our kids after the school is over, the new Assistant Teacher accompanies children till the school gate. He often talks to us about our kids' progress.\" Teacher in charge Siddhartha Choudhury said, \"We maintain a cosy relationship between the parents and the teachers. It was the same with Atarul. The parents too are happy with him and treat him as a normal friend.\" Atarul has four siblings of whom he is the only educated one. He wants to take care of his elderly parents.
