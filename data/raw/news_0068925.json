Article continues below \nSeemingly in an existential mood, Hamilton admitted to think about what he would do afterwards, but maintained that upon seeing the new car he was convinced that he was going to stay, affirming that he is still competitive, still hungry, and driving at his best. \nContinuing on the subject of Rosberg’s exit, Hamilton reflected and admitted that he would never do the same as his German rival. Article continues below Story of fan who missed out on €34,200 thanks to Leroy Sane has brilliant ending \nHe said : “I can understand the feeling of wanting to do something different. \n“Every now and then I have a thought of what I will do afterwards. Then I see that car and I am like, ‘I think I am going to stay’. \n“I am still competitive, still hungry and driving at my best. \n“Ultimately, it is always a great thing to go out on top. That is a big question for any athlete at the top level — what point are you at the top and are you going to continue to be there? \n“It has been a long, hard slog for him and he finally got the title. \n“Maybe he did not want to risk retiring at the end of this year and not being in the same position. \n“But I don’t think like that. If I win the championship, then the next year it all starts again.” \nHamilton made his intentions clear about the Melbourne race on March 26, insisting that he has “moved on” after losing out to Rosberg and that the feelings from last year are not lingering. \nMeanwhile, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff will be hoping for a better relationship between Hamilton and Bottas after the former’s difficult partnership with Rosberg. \nSpeaking on Mercedes’ prospects, he stated that it’s a new dynamic and he sees it as an opportunity to start from square one with a healthy relationship, before adding that there will be no games and no warfare, because there is no history. \nWill Lewis Hamilton take the prize in Melbourne?
