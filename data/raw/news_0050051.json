That may not be the case anymore.\nThe latest Atom C3000 chips announced on Tuesday have up to 16 cores and are more sophisticated than ever. The chips are made for storage arrays, networking equipment, and internet of things devices.\nThe new chips have features found mostly in server chips, including networking, virtualization, and error correction features.\nNetworking and storage devices don’t require a lot of horsepower, so the low-power Atom chips fit right in. Only a handful of Intel server chips have more than 16 cores, but the number of Atom cores means the chip can handle more streams of data.\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:49:54.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
