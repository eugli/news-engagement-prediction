Bayern v Arsenal ratings \nT he pity will almost sting Wenger worse than the invective, and it is the clearest sign yet that his 21-year reign is coming to an end . \nOf course there are still plenty of Arsenal supporters who were frothing at the mouth with rage on Wednesday night after the latest implosion, but in the main a more sombre and reflective mood is pervading through the Emirates' faithful. \nThere may even be a small sense of guilt among some fans who now that Wenger seems poised to leave will feel they have gone too far in their criticism of Wenger, be it through banners, chants or social media rants. Heartbreaking. We know. He knows. It's time. pic.twitter.com/pdcz9IUzRv — Daily Cannon (@DailyCannon) February 16, 2017 Arsene knows its the end. Leave him be. — Kick Arse (@kickarseHD) February 15, 2017 \nT hen again there are others who feel that it was the less vocal fans who are to blame for Wenger staying on too long and Arsenal becoming locked in a cycle of fourth-placed finishes and chastening defeats in big matches. \nWhat is clear though is that almost no-one thinks it's in either Wenger or the club's best interest for him to carry on. It's become almost painful to watch the Frenchman in recent weeks, and in his media commitments after the Bayern defeat , Wenger spoke about his players' \"mental collapse\" with an anger and disappointment that is very unusual for him. \nThere used to be a glint in Wenger's eye, a mischievousness, a sense that yes this was a stressful job but above all it was great fun being the Arsenal manager. The mind goes back to March 1998 when on the eve of Arsenal beating Manchester United en route to winning the Premier League, a grinning Wenger cheekily suggested that United should lose the game to make the title race more interesting. \nThat lighthearted, cocksure Wenger is gone now. His era is coming to an end, and just like Sir Alex Ferguson eventually did, most Arsenal fans are damning the Frenchman with sympathy rather than disdain. \nIt's been a gradual journey to this point over the last few years. Wenger's glorious first decade at the club made him universally loved among the supporters, and the goodwill from that 1996-2005 golden age extended into the early part of the 'austerity years' of 2005-2013 when Arsenal balanced the books to pay off the Emirates Stadium debts. Four big calls made by Wenger at Bayern which pointed to a manager who has gone stale | by Jason Burt \nT he goodwill was sustained by Wenger building an exciting young team, with Cesc Fabregas as its figurehead, that was boldly challenging the financial heavyweights of Manchester United and Chelsea. \nBut as Arsenal were forced to sell their best players each year, including captain Fabregas in 2011 and his successor Robin van Persie to United the following year, patience with Wenger and Arsenal's perceived lack of ambition was beginning to wear thin. \nBy the summer of 2013, many Arsenal supporters were in meltdown after being humiliated on the opening day of the season by Aston Villa and approaching transfer deadline day without having made a major signing. \nB ut then Mesut Ozil was signed for big money, and Alexis Sanchez arrived the following summer, and Arsenal's days of financial miserliness were behind them. \nThe problem was this brought renewed expectations and hope, but the results - a couple of FA Cups aside - remained broadly the same. \nThe fanbase became more divided than ever, with many protesting last season but plenty of others publicly showing their support for Wenger. \nAnd then came Wednesday night in Munich. Arsenal were all but eliminated from the Champions League for the seventh straight season at the last-16 stage. \nFor many Arsenal fans this was the final straw. \nThey are not willing to accept they are a plucky underdog anymore. The club is on a sound financial footing, with some outstanding players, and there is no reason to think it's acceptable to be routinely hammered by the best teams in Europe. 10 years ago Wenger hoped to built a young, exciting team around the likes of Cesc Fabregas \nT he striker on Wednesday was not Nicklas Bentdner but Alexis Sanchez; Mesut Ozil lines up in midfield rather than Emmanuel Eboue; but the result is the same, and the one constant is that the manager remains the same. \nExcept in many ways he's not. The current crop of players don't appear to have anything like the same rapport with Wenger as the likes of Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry did in the 'Invincibles' era. \nWenger does not command the respect of his team like he used to. He has become reminiscent of that elderly teacher at school whose good nature the students take advantage of because they know they're not really going to trouble if they mess about in his lessons. \nFormer Bayern Munich and Germany goalkeeper Oliver Khan hinted at a \"school's out\" mood at Arsenal on Thursday, when he said: \"I’ve never seen a team play so bad. Bayern played a team so catastrophically bad without the ball. \n\"The players were so passive, especially Ozil. It’s as if they don’t take the coach seriously anymore.\" Arsenal manager edging towards the exit – but who could fill Wengers boots? \nT hese were brutal words from Khan, but it is hard to disagree with the sentiment, and the image of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain desperately pleading with his team-mates to press with him late on screamed of a team that has no control of cohesion. \nBut what if the unthinkable happened and Wenger stayed on at the end of the season? It would realistically take a very strong finish to the Premier League season and another FA Cup win to make Wenger sign the two-year extension that's being offered, but that is not beyond the realms of possibility. \nIf Wenger were to stay, it's hard to believe anything much would change. Supporters would be furious, but would continue parting with their hard-earned cash to watch the team, and the cycle of false dawns followed by crushing defeats would simply carry on as before. \nThat shouldn't be allowed to happen, both for Wenger's sake and the club's. It's been a magnificent 21 years, but the sadness enveloping the Emirates is overwhelming. \nThe anger has largely gone, now so too must Wenger.
