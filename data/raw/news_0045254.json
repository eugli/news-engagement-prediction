February 20, 2017 11:07am \nTHE drama at the My Kitchen Rules dining table is heating up but apparently suggestions there’s no love lost between the contestants could be exaggerated. \nThat’s because the couples were advised to keep a diary during filming to keep track of how events really unfolded. \nBrisbane couple Matt and Alyse said they were given the tip so they could look back and ensure events didn’t become skewed in their own minds as a result of watching the show – then they wouldn’t beat themselves up about encounters with other contestants. media_camera Queensland My Kitchen Rules contestants Alyse & Matt, Picture: Channel 7 \nApparently, the contestants – who get along well – have also been sending each other pre-emptive apology texts when they know there’s a piece-to-camera coming up that might upset another person in the group. \nAlyse said: “Sometimes we text and say ‘just so you know I say this about you tonight and I’m really sorry’.” \nAlyse has already received a text from Brisbane’s Della warning her about comments where she called out her “resting b**** face”. \nDella’s double backflip \nSPEAKING of My Kitchen Rules, Confidential hears Della originally applied to the show with someone else. \nIt is understood when that friend wasn’t able to participate in the reality show, Della was forced to find someone else and convinced Tully to sign up. \nBut in another twist the house they cooked in during last night’s instant restaurant was actually owned by Tully’s relative because neither of their houses fit the size requirements handed out by the show. media_camera Della and Tully were not the original combination for My kitchen Rules. Picture: Jamie Hanson \nTully wasn’t the only reality star to get a last-minute call up. Queensland backpackers Matt and Monni from Nine’s Travel Guides were also not the original pairing. \nMonni had signed up with someone else but was asked by the show if she had anyone else in mind who would fit the brief. \nShe immediately thought of Matt, who she hadn’t seen for more than a year. He was in London when they got the call up and almost missed the deadline to accept the offer because of the time difference. \nJen reveals truth behind Alex Perry split \nJENNIFER Hawkins had a moment of panic at the Myer Autumn launch last week when she realised the thigh high split on her Alex Perry gown went a little higher than expected. \nThe face of Myer opened the show in front of 120 of Australia’s fashion movers and shakers and a wall of flashing cameras wearing the risqué design. \nHawkins admitted she walked in it for the first time in front of the media and had a moment of terror as she walked towards the red carpet runway. media_camera Jen Hawkins walks the catwalk at the Myer 2017 Autumn Fashion Launch. Picture: Jake Nowakowski \n“I came out thinking ‘Oh no,” she laughed. “But it’s all OK.” \nWhile she avoided disaster, Confidential spotted a few other stars suffering from wardrobe failure on the night. \nMyer ambassador Jodi Anasta found herself in hot water when her rear zip started going south during dinner. \nLuckily Myer chief executive Richard Umbers spotted the wayward zip and happily corrected it at the dining table to the delighter of those at the table. \nConfidential spies heard Sydney model Tahnee Atkinson arrived a few minutes late because she had forgotten to shave her legs and had to frantically do so in her hotel room. \nAs she arrived she confided in friends that she was extremely concerned her sample size By Johnny dress might rip during the night. \nShe joked that her plan was to quickly run back stage for a costume change. \nSheppard sheepish over support gig \nTHE members of Sheppard had a tough time keeping their support slot for Justin Bieber a secret. \nAfter finding out they had landed the gig on his Australian tour, the Brisbane indie pop band were “on the phone every day” to their manager asking if they could spill the beans. \nGeorge Sheppard confessed to Confidential that he had revealed the news to “a select few people” including some family members, close friends and his girlfriend. \n“It was really hard not to blurt it out on social media but we had to wait for the right moment,” he said. \nCeleb’s 50 Shades rendezview \nLOVE it or hate it, it seems 50 Shades Darker is certainly having an effect on some. \nIn fact, one local celebrity revealed the sequel film to 50 Shades of Grey , which is based on the erotic romance novels by British author E.L. James, had her in quite a rush to get home – to have “adult cuddles” with her hubby that is. \nApparently the star even left before the film ended. \n“I had to hurry up and get the kids to bed so we could,” she said.
