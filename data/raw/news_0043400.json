The two ex-Beatles teamed up in the recording studio to work on a track for Starr's 19th solo album and follow up to 2015's Postcards from Paradise . \nRolling Stone reports on Feb. 20 that Starr revealed the big news via updates posted Feb. 19 on his official Twitter account. The pair of two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Famers were also joined by Starr's brother-in-law – Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh and longtime Starr collaborator Bruce Sugar. \nThe session was held in Starr's recording studio, located in his home in Los Angeles. Macca and Walsh are the latest in a string of celebrity friends that have contributed to the iconic British drummer's as-yet-untitled studio project. Other recent artists to aid the “It Don't Come Easy” hitmaker on the upcoming effort have included: Peter Frampton , Eagles bassist Timothy B. Schmit , Dave Stewart and Dave Grohl along with members of Starr's current All-Starr Band . \n“Thanks for coming over and playing great bass,” writes Starr in his Twitter post, accompanied by a photo of Sir Paul with his arm around Starr in the studio. “I love you man peace and love.” \n\"And look out Joe W. came out to play, “ Starr adds in a second Twitter update with a photo of Walsh, Starr and McCartney mugging for the camera. “What a day I'm having.” \nThe ex-Fab Four legends last recorded together on the tracks “Peace Dream” and “Walk with You” on Starr's 2010 solo album Y Not . The pair last performed together live during the 2014 Grammy Awards' tribute to The Beatles, which fans can check out above. \nMcCartney will reissue his chart-topping 1989 studio album Flowers in the Dirt in multiple formats on March 24 via MPL/Capitol/UMe. The “Band on the Run” hitmaker will kick off his 2017 road schedule with a three-night stand April 27 – April 30 in Tokyo at Tokyo Dome . \nStarr is expected to release the new studio album sometime in late spring. Although dates have not yet been confirmed, a 2017 summer tour in support of the album is expected to follow. \nFor all the latest information on Paul McCartney, click here .
