(Photo: Michael C. Johnson, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBaylor emerged victorious in a tight battle with Texas Tech in the teams' last meeting in Waco. \nIn the Red Raiders' home gym on Monday night, the No. 4 Bears found themselves on the losing end of a tight game that Texas Tech opened up late. \nTexas Tech defeated foul-plagued Baylor 84-78 to give the Bears their fourth loss of the season. \nStarting guard Manu Lecomte fouled out with over seven minutes remaining, and fellow starter Ishmail Wainright fouled out with under a minute to go. As a team, Baylor finished with 32 fouls. \nTexas Tech improved to 17-9 on the season (5-8 in Big 12 Conference play), picking up their second top-10 home win of the season. \nBaylor fell to 22-4 overall, and, more importantly, the Bears' loss dropped them to 9-4 in the Big 12, providing another roadblock in their attempts to wrestle the Big 12 regular-season championship away from Kansas. The Jayhawks, who are seeking their 13th consecutive Big 12 title, are 10-2 in the Big 12 entering their game later Monday against West Virginia. Facebook Posted!
