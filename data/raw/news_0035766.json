(Bill Cooney/PGA TOUR) \nPACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. – Notes and observations from Friday’s abbreviated second round of the Genesis Open, where Sam Saunders and Jhonattan Vegas share the lead at 7-under. Heavy rain and wind suspended play with only 24 players completing Round 2. For more Round 2 coverage, click here for the Daily Wrap-up . WEATHER WOES \nA serious deluge and high winds forced play to end early on Friday with a clear majority of the field still playing or having not yet started the second round. Los Angeles is not known for rain but the city and Riviera Country Club were expecting one of its biggest storms in years. \nThe National Weather Service was expecting the storm to dump up to 6 inches of rain on Los Angeles County beaches and valleys and 5 to 10 inches on south-facing foothills and coastal mountain slopes. \nAs such a flash flood watch was issued from Friday morning through Saturday morning with most of that rainfall expected to fall within a short time Friday afternoon and evening. \nForecasters expect rain could potentially fall at a rate of more than an inch an hour, putting Saturday’s 7 a.m. restart in severe doubt. \nPrior to the suspension of play eucalyptus branches had already begun to fall around Riviera forcing officials to act swiftly. \n“We could have played a little bit more, but why? It's going to get nothing but worse as you can see. So my thought and the staff's thought was let's get the spectators and the players out of here and somewhere safe and we'll see what we do tomorrow,” Mark Russell the PGA TOUR VP of Rules and Competition said. \n“We’re hoping for the best. Matt Morton and his staff do a great job here at Riviera. They're going to be in here very early. They're expecting high winds tonight and they'll probably have some cleanup to do but if we don't get that five inches of rain that they predicted, hopefully we can play golf in the morning at 7:00.” \nRiviera has faced rain battles in the past, no more so than in 2005 when Adam Scott was declared the unofficial winner through just 36 holes of play.

The nine-time PGA TOUR winner was three under on his second round through 16 holes to move up to 5-under, just two off the lead. \nHaving faced similar travails early in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am before going on to win Spieth felt right at home in the cold, wet blustery conditions. \n“Last week actually was great prep for it because we played through conditions like this that first round so it was just about trying to stay patient,” Spieth said. \n“Things aren't going to always go your way on a day like today. Actually rarely they're going to go your way. So try and pick your spots on the easy holes and then from there hit putts with the right speed and make it as stress free as possible. \n“It's obviously easier said than done. But very pleased with 3-under on this round. I didn't think I could get much more out of it.” \nSpieth did admit the other side of the draw is likely to have it better considering they didn’t play in the wind and rain and will eventually return to a softer, more gettable golf course. \nThe likes of leader Sam Saunders, Phil Mickelson and reigning PGA TOUR Player of the Year Dustin Johnson have that luxury. \n“Yeah it’s a tough break on this wave, but that happens,” Spieth said. \n“Go out tomorrow and play a strong last couple holes and see if we can take advantage this weekend. I don't think the fairways are going to be much of a problem. It's the greens that it could be a lot tougher to putt on, on poa annua once they get soft. \n“Again, very similar to last week, just trying to stay patient, not get too upset when you may hit a good shot and it may not turn out, or a good putt that may not go in. Just stay patient and let it kind of come to you.” Highlights Jordan Spieth's lucky break yields birdie on No. 6 at the Genesis Open CALL OF THE DAY", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:11:02.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
