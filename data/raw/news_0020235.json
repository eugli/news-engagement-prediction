The decision was criticised at the time because the sport can be lethal, and it was reversed within months. \nAccording to Branson, Obama studied the pastime for two days and flew a kite from the beach, \"as if going back to being a child again,\" before heading out into the waves. \nBranson was trying to learn a similar sport, foilboarding, which uses a modified board that rises a few feet above the water. He wrote that he challenged the ex-president over which of them would succeed first. \nObama triumphed, he said, by kiteboarding for 100m. \n\"After all he has done for the world, I couldn't begrudge him his well-deserved win,\" Branson wrote. â€“ Reuters <> <>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:37:18.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
