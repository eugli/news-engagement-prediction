File MANILA, Philippines ​— Malacañang is leaving it to the Department of Justice (DOJ) to determine whether to file cases against President Rodrigo Duterte’s fraternity brothers who were dismissed from the immigration bureau after they were accused of extorting millions from a Chinese gaming operator. Immigration Deputy Commissioners Al Argosino and Michael Robles—fraternity brothers of the president at the San Beda College of Law’s Lex Talionis Fraternitas, Inc.—were accused of extorting P50 million from gambling tycoon Jack Lam. Duterte has dismissed the two from the service and gave assurances that they would be accountable for their actions. Asked by radio station dzRB Sunday whether the president would order the filing of criminal charges against Argosino and Robles, presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said: “I suppose that’s a matter of DOJ to recommend to the president. Let’s just wait for the DOJ to make a recommendation.” Malacañang officials previously said cases would be filed against the two former immigration officials if the DOJ finds probable cause. Presidential Communications Assistant Secretary Ana Marie Banaag said in an earlier interview that the dismissal of Argosino and Robles would not save them from criminal liability. Lam allegedly tried to bribe officials to free the more than 1,300 undocumented Chinese nationals working for him. Argosino and Robles have denied extorting money from Lam and claimed that they were just framed up. The bribery allegation is now the subject of a Senate hearing.
