Garbage will now also be collected on Saturday, he said.\nBulmer said it's not easy navigating the snow piles around the city, which are made worse by a thick sheet of ice below, a leftover from a major ice storm two weeks ago.\n\"It's like concrete,\" he said.\n\"We try to slow it down a little bit, and try to work with the public and maybe go a little extra, like dig that garbage can or dolly out of the snow, give them a break that way.\"\nFredericton Most motorists only have one, maybe two vehicles to dig out.
