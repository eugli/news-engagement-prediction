The representative also confirmed there's a hardware issue with the new monitor. \nOur source says Apple Store employees were instructed this weekend to continue to display the LG monitors on the show floor but not sell them if a customer wants one. Apple's online store listed the monitor as shipping within five to six weeks as of Monday morning. \nApple helped LG develop the UltraFine monitor and launch it with the new MacBook Pro. But since the monitor's launch, there have been reports of problems such as screen flickering, interference with nearby routers, and other issues. There's an entire thread of the problems documented on this MacRumors forum . \nThe collaboration with LG was a signal that Apple doesn't intend to make its own monitors anymore. Its last monitor was the Cinema Display, which hasn't been updated in years. \nWe've reached out to Apple for comment.
