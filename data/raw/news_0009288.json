ADVERTISEMENT \nHe said the new operation would likely assemble iPhones for the domestic market. \nApple has only a two-percent share of the Indian market, well behind rival Samsung on 23 percent, according to research firm Canalys. \nHowever, last year it had 48 percent of the premium sector in which phones sell for $450 and above. \nExperts said manufacturing locally would reduce the company’s costs and enable it to lower prices. \n“They’re eager to be here because they’ve identified India as a strategic focus market,” said Jaideep Mehta of research firm IDC. \n“They had a fantastic 2016 in India and shipped more two million devices to India, and now they’re looking to ultimately manufacture here as that gives them more flexibility to respond to market changes.” \nApple currently sells its phones in India through third-party retailers. \nIt is eager to open its own stores but Indian law would require it to procure 30 percent of the components of its products locally. \nIt is not clear whether the Karnataka plans would help it clear that hurdle. \nReports in Indian media said Wistron Corp., a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, was lined up to assemble iPhones at a plant on the outskirts of tech hub Bangalore. \nApple outsources all its manufacturing globally. \nAnalysts said that if confirmed the move would be a coup for India’s government, which has been trying to persuade foreign companies to manufacture in the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T15:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T11:01:20.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
