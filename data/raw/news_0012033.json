As a highly sought-after face in the fashion industry, she has also had the opportunity to launch a successful footwear and accessories brand and work with a number of respected brands. The 29-year-old rose to fame through her popular blog, The Blonde Salad , which she launched in 2009 with her then-boyfriend Riccardo Pozzoli. Having built an impressive brand and accumulated a massive following of 8 million followers on her Instagram channel, Ferragni is often asked to dispense advice on growing a business.\nOn Thursday, February 9, the blogger will meet with MBA students of a Luxury Marketing elective course offered by the Harvard Business School and give a lecture alongside her now-business partner Pozzoli, according to Women’s Wear Daily .\n(Photo: Getty Images) More Ferragni and Pozzoli are expected to touch on their experience growing the lifestyle platform and the in’s and out’s of running a successful company so heavily impacted by social media, WWD shared.\nIn 2016, Ferragni was the subject of a Harvard blogging case study. At the time of the study, Professor Anat Keinan, an Associate Professor of Business Administration in the Marketing Unit at Harvard Business School, spoke on why the blogger was selected for the study.\n“She is the most successful fashion blogger,” Keinan told CBS . “She was very creative in monetizing her blog and turning it into a real business, a multi-million dollar business. One of the main reasons for her success is this ability to be relatable but also aspirational at the same time.”\nWith such a devoted fanbase, Ferragni keeps her followers tuned in to her every move. She recently alerted them about her upcoming talk at Harvard Business School.\n\n\n“Next stop New York to shoot a new campaign tomorrow, then Boston to speak for the second time at Harvard University about @theblondesalad business case study and then back to New York for fashion week ???? #AmericanDays #TheBlondeSaladNeverStops #NeverEver ,” she captioned the photo.\nRelated:  \nDo People Still Care About New York Fashion Week? \nChrissy Teigen’s Hilarious Reaction to Wardrobe Malfunction \n\nFollow us on Instagram , Facebook , and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:37:20.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
