That’s it. I think she didn’t know the real names of those two persons,\" said Mr Erwin. \nMalaysian police had confirmed on Friday that a VX nerve agent was used to kill Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \nSiti, 25, and Vietnamese suspect Doan Thi Huong, 28, are accused of wiping the chemical on his face as he prepared to board a flight to Macau on Feb 13. \nThe police had also earlier dismissed claims that Siti believed the attack was for a prank, saying that the women had moved towards the bathroom right after the poison attack because they were aware the liquid was toxic and that they needed to wash their hands. \n\"Physically, she (Siti) is healthy and she could answer all of our questions well. And we didn’t find any physical signs that she has been affected (by the poison),\" said Mr Erwin.
