Glamping in the USA There's just something about camping that offers you a reset like few other types of vacations. It's rejuvenating to be in the great outdoors miles away from any city noise, smell of the campfire, see the sparkling of the Milky Way under a black velvet sky. For some the flip side of camping is the lack of creature comforts, such as no hot water, subsisting on oatmeal and rice, and having to pitch a tent. Enter the glamping trend, or glamorous camping, where cloud-like beds, gourmet food, and deliciously hot showers may be par for the course. If this sounds good to you, you might want to check out one or more of these glamping hotspots in the USA.\n2. Firelight Camps in Ithaca, New York For an upstate New York waterfall glamping experience, book a stay at Ithaca’s Firelight Camps , located along the 70-acre property of La Tourelle Resort & Spa. Grab your girls (or your guy) for a wild foraging adventure, followed by a hands-on feast led by Food Network-star Emma Frisch. Then get ready for some serious Instagraming to commence once you check out your accommodations, which include a hardwood floor safari tent with a king or queen bed, sitting porch, lantern lights, daily breakfast, and nightly marshmallow roasting. There’s also a lobby bar that serves Finger Lakes craft beverages, communal campfires in the outdoor lounge area with games and bocce ball and a store, where you can stock up on homemade trail snacks. #LuxeLife\nGet closer to nature by sleeping in a teepee inCody Wyoming Trout Ranch in Cody, Wyoming.
