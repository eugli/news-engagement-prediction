Buck had tried for years to get federal courts to look at his claim that his rights were violated when jurors were told by a defense expert witness that Buck was more likely to be dangerous in the future because he is black.\nRELATED LINKS Supreme Court weighs case of Mexican boy slain across border Trump’s Supreme Court pick is deeply opposed to assisted suicide Pence hopeful Senate won’t have to go ‘nuclear’ in Supreme Court fight Chief Justice John Roberts said in his majority opinion that the federal appeals court that heard Buck’s case was wrong to deny him a hearing.\nIn Texas death penalty trials, one of the “special issues” jurors must consider when deciding punishment is whether the defendant they’ve convicted would be a future danger.\nRoberts wrote that the testimony of Dr. Walter Quijano “was potent evidence. Dr. Quijano’s testimony appealed to a powerful racial stereotype — that of black men as ‘violence prone.”\nJustices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented. “Having settled on a desired outcome, the court bulldozes procedural obstacles and misapplies settled law to justify it,” Thomas said.\nLead counsel Christina Swarns (L) for Texas death row inmate Duane Buck (not pictured) hugs Buck’s stepsister Phyllis Taylor in front of the U.S. Supreme Court in D.C. in 2016. Photo by Gary Cameron/Reuters\nBuck was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend and another man in 1995. His case was among six in 2000 that then-Texas Attorney General John Cornyn in a news release said needed to be reopened because Quijano’s statements were racially charged. In the other five cases, new punishment hearings were held and each convict again was sentenced to death. Cornyn, a Republican, is now the state’s senior U.S. senator.\nBuck’s lawyers contended the attorney general, by then Cornyn’s successor Greg Abbott, broke a promise by contesting his case. But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that it could find nothing in the case record to indicate the state made an error or promised not to oppose any move to reopen the case. Abbott now is the state’s governor.\nREAD MORE: Supreme Court weighs case of Mexican boy slain across border \n  Duane Buck John Roberts scotus Supreme Court texas PREVIOUS POST AP fact check: Did border agents have their hands tied under Obama?
