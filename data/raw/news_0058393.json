The irony is that these stories mobilize the same language and logic of identity politics - while denigrating identity politics - to flip the script, so that conservatives are the innocent victims of liberals who are just so mean . \nThere is so much to parse in this sleight of hand: knee-jerk contrarianism; the strange bedfellows created by single issue voters; a confusion of anecdote with expertise; a sense that “feeling” right is as important as facticity. However, what makes this sense of injury so galling is that it is largely rhetorical, and frames disagreement as assault, as opposed to more overt or consequential forms of discrimination, deportation or violence. By trafficking in this false equivalence of injury, conservatives have eked out a “place at the table” of the “oppression Olympics” - exactly the posture they deplore - all the while refusing to acknowledge that others have good reason to feel actually threatened. \nAs an American, I am nothing if not committed to those principles essential to the American experiment: religious freedom (and inclusion), the right to free speech, the right of control over our own bodies - all of which have been central to the gay rights movement. However, contrary to these ideals is the rabid individualism and selfishness to the point of being incapable of empathy - an attitude not exclusive to gay conservatives, but the pith that forms the meat of their narratives. \nTo these gay conservatives, I say, since you have chosen the company to keep - enjoy these peers who legislate against your rights and dream of a country able to deny you service under the guise of religious toleration. Rather than reward you for simply holding a position, which Alexis de Tocqueville reminds us is the most basic and favorite American prerogative, I respond with a FuckEmbargo . \nWhile the Left may call out “racism,” “privilege,” “self-loathing” or any number of terms we would do well to recalibrate to better find their marks, you have enabled material consequences for millions of Americans (including yourself) vulnerable to the sweeping policy changes Trump envisions. If that consequence is as abhorrent as you suggest, get your house in order. This isn’t to push the Right to a coherent platform, since there really is no there there, beyond a ruthless desire to “win” and to paint in the broadest strokes of fear and intolerance. \nHate may not be your aim, but it is the result of those with whom you have chosen to make common cause. Trump is anathema to an inclusive America, so while I encourage rigorous intellectual debate on the thought experiments of deregulation, lower taxes, critiques of political correctness, when the people you vote for and their pundits, like Milo Yiannopoulos , create an environment in which more and more Americans are endangered, you’ve chosen a party no longer about the values you protest to hold dear. \nFor those of you who similarly heed the siren song of power, this contrarian posturing will make you feel important, acknowledged, at least plausibly “smart.” Especially in DC and the Right’s stumbling political machine, this fluency in distraction, dissembling, bluster without substance, is of course rewarded, albeit in blood money. \nIf your only concern is your paycheck, your sense of right or your gratification, I will certainly not abet these pleasures when you have so impacted mine. In this bed you have made, I will not join you. You no longer have recourse to my civility, joy, creativity, intellect or body - exactly those prerogatives your leadership has not extended to Americans, in word and deed. God-willing, you may effect change within the fearful leviathan of the Republican Party, but you will do so without my help. If you truly believe change is not possible without hurting someone, I insist the hurt be yours. \nI invoke this FuckEmbargo , Lysistrata-style, not to permanently foreclose conversation and further cleave the country, but to make the simple statement that if you have chosen to hurt others, my body is “shutting this whole thing down.” We did not put you here - your choices did. I will not tolerate gay men, Trump supporters and the global Right in their embrace of xenophobia, misogyny, transphobia, the shibboleth of religious toleration that in reality only embraces a narrow interpretation of evangelical Christianity. \nThe rest of us must resist especially those who might otherwise get a pass when our desire trumps principles. Beyond our bodies and our business, we must make clear the cost and consequence of your choice. We cannot sleep, socialize or associate with gay Republicans - but must support each other so that our businesses can do the same. Since I’m convinced that, like Samson, without their bleach blonde locks, Trump surrogates would lose their power, we must continue to refuse to dye, treat, tone or spackle the likes of Kellyanne, Ivanka, Ann or Kayleigh. \nThis is more than snark. Presuming you have exclusive access to “right,” is not so much pathological as inconsistent with American values enshrined to bring people together. A free press is not the enemy. Investigating foreign interference in our most sacred right to vote is not partisan. Acknowledging the suffering of those unlike you isn’t weakness; it is strength. \nOn the flip side, this is a reminder of the depth of work we must do to simultaneously close ranks and be more inclusive across lines of color, class, gender, age, ableism, religion, sex. While I encourage conservatives to take the log out of their eyes, I will also attend to the speck in mine. In that vein, gay men and women of conscience must lead with love - to articulate a new vision of radical inclusion. We must emphasize a “yes and” logic of activism and engagement, because it is among those who respect rights and plurality that we need to focus our energies. Just as gay men and women, trans-people, people of color, undocumented persons, once found common cause against police brutality and the shattering silence of Republicans in the face of gay death, we must include as we exclude. \nFor as much as gay Republicans and Trump supporters have abetted intolerance, we must embrace kindness, in ways that exceed our own insecurities and ego. For better or worse, I am not indulging the schadenfreude of “punch a Nazi,” since as a student of race, genocide and politics, I know too well that once the lingua franca of politics becomes violence, anything is possible. My charge instead, for gay men across the country and anyone invested in a brighter future, is to engage in our own extreme vetting to forgo sleeping, socializing, or engaging with those whose vision of democracy is predicated on always being right. But, to get our own home in order, we must affirm our fallibility, our capacity to learn, grow and form a more perfect union. \nTo gay conservatives, I reiterate: the current climate of the Republican party is no longer as innocuous as voting for your hometown football team, being contrarian to prove that you can, or voting with a single issue in mind. Until you fortify yourself and embrace the call to engage in meaningful conversation, you do not have a place in the gay spaces, world and future we envision: a world built on the simple certainty that we might make people’s lives better without doing harm. I am not dismissing your concerns. However, they are so intentionally ignorant of mine and those of your party that until we find common ground that heeds the fundamental call of civil society to see beyond ourselves, you are not welcome. \nPopular wisdom in Germany long held that it was sexual frustration that hardwired the Nazis for aggression and atrocity. Dagmar Herzog has convincingly demonstrated that this simply wasn’t true: if anything, the Nazis were oversexed and in conflict with organized religion over their disrespect for religious mores. So, while I’m sensitive to avoid crying Nazis !, since many on the Right has embraced this ideology, let’s ensure that the Nazis of our time are undersexed, underserved, and righteously marginalized. \nA central tenet of American pluralism is that we locate unity through difference, that we celebrate disagreement and discord just as rigorously as we fight for our beliefs. When we find the means to think beyond ourselves, our paychecks, and our own sense of injury, we might countenance an America true to its values and capable of providing all its peoples the means to thrive to the fullest of their potential. \nIn the meantime, however, I ain’t fucking wit you.
