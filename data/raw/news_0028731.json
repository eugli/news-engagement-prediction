Ukraine frontline (VIDEO) \n“The office of the Russian State Investigative Committee, dealing with crimes involving the use of prohibited means and methods of warfare, has discovered and procedurally documented irrefutable evidence that the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been using weapons of mass destruction, namely the Tochka-U tactical missile complexes [SS-21 Scarab in NATO classification] against civilians in the armed conflict in the south-east of Ukraine,” the investigative committee said in a statement published on its official website on Monday. \nThe committee also stated that the Tochka-U can fire a wide range of missiles, both conventional and non-conventional, nuclear or chemical. \n“According to the investigation data, the Ukrainian military used missiles equipped with high-explosive fragmentation and cluster charges against the civilian population of Donbass,” the committee stated, noting that one such high-explosive warhead produces up to 14,500 fragments, scattering them over an area of up to three hectares. The cluster rocket produces even more fragments – up to 15,800 pieces – ensuring damage to manpower and soft-skinned vehicles in an open area ranging from 3.5 to 7 hectares. \nREAD MORE: Dealing with damage: Locals in Donetsk clear debris after days of shelling (EXCLUSIVE) \nA significant number of Tochka-U systems remained in Ukraine after the fall of the Soviet Union.

It was initially designed for localized strikes aiming to destroy small targets, such as ground-based reconnaissance and strike systems, control stations, aircraft and helicopter parking, ammunition and fuel storage, etc. deep within enemy positions.
