Paul Nuttall's 'Nukip' vision: 'Beer-swilling is an image of the past' Read more \nVictims’ families reacted with dismay . Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, whose 18-year-old son James died in the disaster, described it as “appalling”. \nThe resignations will come as a blow to Nuttall days before he attempts to unseat Labour in the hotly contested Stoke-on-Trent Central byelection on Thursday. \nIn 2012, Heatherington became the youngest candidate to stand for elected mayor in Liverpool. \nNuttall first publicly claimed to have been at Hillsborough in a letter to the Liverpool Daily Post in July 2010. He raised the matter again in May last year, telling the BBC’s Politics Show North West that he had been in the overcrowded Leppings Lane end of the ground. \nHe told the programme he believed the police officers responsible for the disaster should be prosecuted. “I think people should carry the can for their actions,” he said. Paul Nuttall gets emotional at Ukip conference – video \nNuttall was 12 at the time of the disaster, and was a pupil at Savio high school in Bootle, Liverpool. One of his former teachers, a Roman Catholic priest, told the Guardian that the school believed it had been aware of the identities of every boy who had been at Hillsborough in order to help them through a difficult period, and that Nuttall was not among them. \nA fellow pupil at the school who says he has been a friend of Nuttall for decades said the Ukip leader had never mentioned being there. “I have been very good friends with Paul for over 25 years,” he said, adding that during that time they had never spoken about Hillsborough. \nWhile the teacher and friend expressed surprise that Nuttall had said he was at Hillsborough, their comments do not prove that he was not present. \nNuttall’s admission about the inaccurate statement on his website came in an interview with Liverpool’s Radio City News. The interview followed his denial that he had lied about being a survivor of the 1989 disaster, in which 96 Liverpool fans were killed at an FA Cup semi-final. \nWhen the presenter, Dave Easson, who was at Hillsborough, the home of Sheffield Wednesday, on the day of the disaster, showed him the evidence that the claim had been made on his website, Nuttall replied: “I haven’t lost a close, personal friend. I’ve lost someone who I know.” \nNuttall maintains that he was at Hillsborough on the day of the disaster and has said only “scum of the earth” would suggest otherwise. \nUkip gave the Guardian two statements on behalf of Nuttall, one from his father and another from a Ukip employee, saying that they and Nuttall had been at Hillsborough on the day of the disaster, 15 April 1989. The statement from Nuttall’s father gave an incorrect age for his son at the time. \nAt the Ukip party conference in Bolton last week a visibly emotional Nuttall refused to answer questions from reporters asking him to prove he had been at Hillsborough and described the episode as a “smear campaign”.
