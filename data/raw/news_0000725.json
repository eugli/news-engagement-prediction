The manager is good, so they will be second or third. \n“Tottenham also are strong. We lost there, but for me it is more Manchester United. They are more experienced. That is my opinion, maybe I’m wrong.” Reds, Blues share spoils 2:32 \nHazard played under current Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho, with the pair winning the 2014/15 Premier League title together at Chelsea. \nBut with Mourinho replaced by Antonio Conte ahead of this season, the midfielder said there had been a big change at the club in terms of training loads. \n“In tactics and training we do more with Conte,” Hazard said. \n“We work a lot of tactical positions and we know exactly what we have to do on the pitch, where I have to go and where the defenders have to go. \n“We know exactly what to do. With Mourinho, he put in a system but we didn’t work lots. We know what to do because we play football, but maybe the automatisms were a little bit different.” \nHazard said another key difference between Mourinho and Conte was the way the respectives managers set up their midfields. \n“With Mourinho, Nemanja Matic was behind me in the season when we won the title and sometimes I stayed in front and Matic did the job,” he said. \n“With Conte it’s different. I close more inside because Marcos Alonso is there as a wing-back. I just need to be ready to counter-attack if we get the ball.” \nRONALDO OPENS UP ON WHAT MAKES HIM TICK \nCristiano Ronaldo is as well-known for his fanatical commitment to training as his exploits on the field. \nNow he’s revealed some of the processes that keep him ticking over season-to-season. \nThe Real Madrid star said a combination of exercises were crucial to keeping him in top shape. Ronaldo mutes jeering fans 1:17 \n“I try to keep a thorough training program with many exercises to support all the different parts of my body,” he told JOE.co.uk. \n“You need them all in football so this is just one of many that I do both in training and at home.” \n“There are many [exercises] I prefer but honestly, I give my best in every one of them because different exercises serve different and important objectives. \n“I try to always be a hard worker on everything I do and training is so important.” \nWhen asked if he’d received a particular tip in his career, Ronaldo said he’d enjoyed working under multiple coaches. \nThose included Sir Alex ferguson, Jose Mourinho and most recently, Zinedine Zidane. \n“It is impossible to pick out one piece of advice, but I am lucky to have worked with amazing coaches my whole career,” he admits. \n“Each of them sees things differently but each has great knowledge and experience, and I love to learn from them all.” \nLALLANA’S INSANE PRE-GAME DIET \nWe always knew footballers ate a lot. \nBut Liverpool gun Adam Lallana has gone into just how much is required to fuel his hard-running game. \nWhen the Reds played two games within 44 hours at the start of the year, it required a monster feed in order for Jurgen Klopp’s players to run out the game. \nLallana revealed the process of refuelling for the second game started straight after the first. \n“We literally got into the dressing room after the City game and had a plate of pasta — probably the last thing in the world you wanted to do is eat because you had no appetite coming in after the game, but it was about getting it into you with another game 44 hours later,” Lallana told Liverpool’s website. \n“Getting home, I ate another big plate of pasta and some meat. \n“It was a bit easier to eat then because it was a couple of hours after the game, but even though it was 10.30 at night, it was still important to get it into your system.” Adam Lallana. Source: AFP \nBut the effort didn’t stop there, with Lallana eating a combination of breakfast foods, sandwiches and pasta throughout the day. \n“The next day, it was about eating all day, as often and as much as possible really,” he said. \n“I think I woke up about 7.45am and had toast in bed. Then I went downstairs and about 10 o’clock, I had some Weetabix with banana. \n“At midday, my old man was up at my house so he made bacon and egg sandwiches in a bap, so I had two of them. \n“I got into training at 3pm for recovery and had a yoghurt and a Ryvita-type bread with chicken on and another shake. We did recovery and then after that, I had pasta, chicken and veg. \n“We travelled to Sunderland, got there about 8.30pm at night and there was a big sandwich station set up for us — so I had two big sandwiches, packed with meat, and a yoghurt. Then the next day, on the morning of the game, you eat as much as you can.” \nThat’s quite the effort. \nLIVERPOOL STAR COPS DRINK-DRIVING PENALTY \nLiverpool forward Roberto Firmino was banned from driving for a year and fined £20,000 ($25,000, 24,000 euros) after admitting drink-driving on Wednesday. \nThe Brazilian international was stopped by police while he was driving his Range Rover in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of Christmas Eve, December 24. \nDefending the 25-year-old at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court, lawyer Michael Hogan said the incident took place the day after Firmino’s family home was targeted by burglars “prepared to use extreme force”. \nHowever, in a statement issued after the hearing, where Firmino had a Portuguese interpreter with him in court, the Liverpool star accepted responsibility. Firmino's double shocker 0:50 \n“I apologise, without reservation, to the club, the manager, my teammates and the supporters for putting myself in this situation,” Firmino said. \n“What I have done is wrong and sets a bad example. \n“I promise to everyone in the LFC (Liverpool Football Club) family that I will learn from this mistake, learn from this experience and not repeat it in the future.” \nLiverpool said in a statement that Firmino had been disciplined for a “lapse in judgment” but did not detail the specific action taken by the Premier League giants, adding it would have no impact on his availability for matches. \n“The club considers this to be an isolated incident and a rare lapse in judgment and professionalism,” Liverpool said. \n“We will however work with the player to further educate him on the dangers associated with drink-driving specifically.” \nEarlier, the court was told how Firmino and his family, as well as friends from Brazil who were staying with them, moved out of the house following the burglary on police advice and were staying in a hotel next to the Merseyside force’s headquarters. \nFirmino had been out to a restaurant before he was stopped by police. “He was preoccupied and he accepts he should have kept a closer eye on what he had to drink,” said Hogan. \nThe hearing was told Firmino, accompanied to court by his wife Larissa Pereira, left the restaurant and took a “wrong turn”. He briefly drove on the wrong side of the road, before being stopped by police. \nA breathalyser test showed he had a reading of 46 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath — above the legal limit of 35. \nCROUCH HITS MILESTONE MARK \nPeter Crouch has had quite the career in the Premier League. \nBut in his most recent stint, the cult hero has hit an impressive mark in his career. \nIn Stoke’s match against Everton, Crouch scored his 100th Premier League goal. \nHe was the 26th player to achieve the milestone.
