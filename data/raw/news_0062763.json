Image caption Majid Akhtar was on a trip to Kings Mill Reservoir in Nottinghamshire when he died on 10 September 2012. \nHe was found by two people walking their dog and was later pronounced dead in hospital. \nDeaney told police she had only lost sight of him for about three seconds - but phone records showed she was on the phone and texting during the half-hour before his death. \nDeaney, from Sneinton Dale in Nottingham, was employed by Nottingham City Council as a day centre care assistant. \nThe council's director for adult social care, Helen Jones, said: \"Majid Akhtar's family have our deepest sympathy - he died on a day out which should have been enjoyable but ended in tragedy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:23:12.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
