Great! Here's a story to raise your internal temperature.\nPeople reports on Rachel Adrian, a Missouri nurse who welcomed a baby boy on Thursday — while her husband, who is a citizen of Iraq, was held overseas because of Donald Trump's muslim ban.\nHoger Ameen had to meet his new born son, Aland, via Skype after his wife gave birth without him at a hospital in Missouri.\n Ameen was obviously distraught about being separated from his wife on what should have been “the happiest moment” of his life.\n“I have a message for my son: Aland, I am so sorry I can’t visit you right now and hold you like other daddies. When you grow up you will understand that because of political problems I couldn’t be there for your birth. Be strong, I’m sorry and I love you.”\nAmeen also had a message for Donald Trump: “I wish you would let me come and I wish I could hold my son.”\nSorry @realDonaldTrump there is one little Iraqi Kurd you can't stop from coming into this country. #RefugeesWelcome #RefugeeBan #MuslimBan pic.twitter.com/HZhK3w1zn2\n— Rachel Adrian (@Rachel_Adrian) January 29, 2017 Ameen, and everyone who cares about upholding the integrity of the Constitution, may get a win soon: A Federal judge has temporarily blocked the immigration order, effectively reopening the country to visa holders immediately.\nFollow Laura on Twitter .\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/RefugeeBan?src=hash", "http://twitter.com/mrpenguino", "https://t.co/HZhK3w1zn2", "http://people.com/human-interest/missouri-nurse-gives-birth-without-her-iraqi-husband-following-trumps-ban/", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/RefugeesWelcome?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/Rachel_Adrian/status/825811989515608065", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/02/03/state.of.washington.v.trump.pdf", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MuslimBan?src=hash"], "published": "2017-02-04T15:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:32:49.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
