As Vogue Accessories Director, Selby Drummond has her eye on all the most important details, namely all the chicest new shoes, bags, hats, and jewelry you’ll want to wear come the fall. Here, she breaks down the eight items that stood out this week. The Row Photo: Mark Leibowitz 1. The Row The Olsens’ masterful sense of refinement was on display in every detail of their Fall collection , right down to combat boots rendered in distressed silver silk and stark white leather. Public School Photo: Luca Tombolini 2. Public School The symbolism of a certain presidential baseball cap was turned on its head when Public School designers Maxwell Osborne and Dao-Yi Chao sent their own version down the runway. Embroidered with the words Make America New York, its fashion message was loud and clear. Altuzarra Photo: Marcus Tondo / Indigital.tv 3. Altuzarra Altuzarra mixed uptown ’80s references with downtown punk for Fall. These red leather elbow-high gloves will keep you feeling tough as nails even when you’re in the mood to sport a headband and a dainty earring. Calvin Klein Photo: Getty Images 4. Calvin Klein Raf Simons began his tenure at Calvin Klein with such a covetable wardrobe of freshly imagined staples that I was left wondering why any of my boots were without metal toes or my pants without contrasting band stripes down the leg. Alexander Wang Photo: Marcus Tondo 5. Alexander Wang Once again, Alexander Wang spoke to the age-old problem of what to wear when you want to be elegant but you’re going to the club. Proenza Schouler Photo: Marcus Tondo 6. Proenza Schouler Designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez continue to raise the bar when it comes to artful dressing. Much like the rest of the collection , these modernist bracelets were as cool as they were sophisticated. Marc Jacobs Photo: Marcus Tondo / Indigital.tv 7. Marc Jacobs A little extra attitude goes a long way, but Marc Jacobs didn’t stop at just a little. The staging for his show at the Park Avenue Armory was stripped down and spare, letting the styling—which included early hip-hop references and oversize gold jewelry—do all the talking. Planned Parenthood CFDA button Photo: Hunter Abrams / BFA.com 8. Planned Parenthood CFDA buttons In a week full of slogan T-shirts and politically themed runway shows—not to mention daily jaw-dropping news alerts—perhaps the most moving show of solidarity in the New York fashion community was the ubiquitous pink Planned Parenthood buttons that were handed out by the CFDA and spotted everywhere from the runway to the street. Each image of the button tagged #IStandWithPP on Instagram prompted a $5 donation from the CFDA to the nonprofit organization. Even if we don’t get it right every time, I do think it’s important for those with a platform in the fashion community to speak out for good—now more than ever.
