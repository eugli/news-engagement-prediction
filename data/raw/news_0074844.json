Two of the images depict the packaging of the device, while the last one shows the alleged Galaxy S8 from the front. The phone in question looks similar, but not identical to another golden device depicted in a leaked picture from January that was also said to be showcasing the Galaxy S8. However, unlike the previous phone, this one doesn’t seem to be carrying any Samsung branding on the front. \nThe Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus are expected to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 and Samsung’s Exynos 8895 system-on-chip (SoC) in certain territories, as well as 4GB of RAM. The base model of both devices will feature 64GB of internal storage and a microSD card slot, as well as IP68 certification denoting that the handset is resistant to both dust particles and water. Recent reports suggest that the Galaxy S8 Plus will boast a 6.2-inch QHD+ screen that’s actually a 6.1-inch one once its rounded corners are accounted for. The Galaxy S8 will likely sport a 5.7-inch display, latest rumors indicate. Both devices are expected to ship with an integrated iris scanner and support for wireless charging. Finally, Samsung’s upcoming flagship duo is expected to introduce Bixby, the company’s upcoming artificial intelligence (AI) assistant developed by an AI startup Viv Labs that the tech giant acquired back in October. Bixby is said to be deeply integrated with all of the default Galaxy apps and is rumored to boast several unique features like the ability to conduct a visual search to identify an object like a magazine and then purchase it online on command. \nWhile Samsung is currently preparing for its Mobile World Congress (MWC) press conference, the South Korean consumer electronics manufacturer already confirmed that the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus won’t be unveiled at the Barcelona-based trade show. Instead, the upcoming flagships are expected to be announced in late March before hitting the market in the second half of April, so more information will likely follow soon.
