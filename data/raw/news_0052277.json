He's capable of playing either fullback slot, a facet that made him particularly attractive to MNUFC. \n“Thiesson is a hugely experienced player with over 300 games in the Swiss League,” said Minnesota head coach Adrian Heath in a club release. “He’s incredibly versatile with two great feet and can play left back and right back. He’s an important piece for us in an area we feel as though we’ve been a little bit short in terms of numbers.” \nAdded sporting director Manny Lagos: “It’s a position on the field where we can always have more depth and experience. This is a player that can play both those positions very well. He's got hundreds of professional games at a high level, starting at both right and left back, which is unique for a player to be that versatile.” \nOver the weekend media reports linked Thiesson to TFC, but FC Luzern responded by stating on their website (in German) that the defender remained under contract with the club, though admitting that he been given \"permission to negotiate\" with \"clubs from North America.\" Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:02:27.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
