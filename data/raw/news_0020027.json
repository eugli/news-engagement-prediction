Since 2006, he has always participated in three events simultaneously - 10m air rifle, 50m prone and 50m 3position - and is the only Indian to have won medals in all three formats in World Cups.\nBut come first ever ISSF World Cup to be hosted by in India, single-event participation will be the new routine for the London Olympics bronze medallist. The World Cup in New Delhi will begin on February 23 and Narang has made it to only the 50m prone event.\nNarang, 32, didn't play enough events in the 50m 3position and finished fourth according to the weighted average score in the 10m air rifle ranking. Only top 3 Indians made the cut.\n\"I am on way to get back on track. I figured some of the technical issues I had in Rio and I am in the process of rectifying them,\" Narang said after a training session at the Balewadi shooting range.\n\"I want to gradually scale it down to one event. I am trying my best to get back in the air rifle team. I am not shooting any competitive 3 position for some time although will be training for the same. That is part of a well-planned strategy,\" said Narang.\nHis love for prone grew over the last couple of years and his silver at the Commonwealth Games in 2014 followed by a bronze at World Cup in 2015, only strengthened his bond with the format. When the Delhi event begins, it may happen that he will shoot in his last prone contest at a World Cup. The ISSF is contemplating the removal of the event from Olympics.\nBut Narang feels he has chalked out his plan to keep himself relevant according to the changes.\n\"Like many other shooters across the world, I shall cross the bridge when it comes. But it will be a sad decision for the eco system of shooting sports (if the event is dropped) since prone is very popular across the world,\" said Narang.\nPost the Rio Games, the shooters were quizzed by the review committee formed by the National Rifle Association of India .\n\"A review was needed because the government spent money on us. There is need for accountability but not nitpicking,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:31:33.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
