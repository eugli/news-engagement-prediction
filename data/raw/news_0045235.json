Audio: Listen to Tom Iggulden's story (AM) \nMr Zapantis is more ambivalent about that option. \n\"It could be part of the policy mix, but some careful analysis would have to be done to make sure that the policies that are chosen by the Government of the day are the most efficient policies,\" he said. \nBut Professor Greig has no doubts an emissions intensity scheme would be the most efficient way to lower the cost of reducing carbon emissions. \n\"Without some sort of economic signal which puts a value on carbon emissions, or signal a price on carbon emissions, we can't expect a more expensive technology to compete with unabated technologies,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:53:38.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
