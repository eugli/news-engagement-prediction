It was also conducted in compliance with Malaysian laws and regulations. \n\"Any suggestion to the contrary is deeply insulting to Malaysia, as is the suggestion that Malaysia is in collusion with any foreign government,\" Foreign Minister Anifah Aman said in a statement. \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
