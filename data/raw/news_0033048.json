There are multiple reasons for this, including the show's inclusive approach to casting and parallels with modern immigration conversation in its alien stories. But the one that made the biggest news was Alex Danvers' coming out story .\nWhen Chyler Leigh was first cast on the series, back when it aired on CBS, Alex Danvers was important primarily for her relationship with Supergirl herself — her sister, Kara Danvers. But upon the show's move to the CW for its second season, her story blossomed, with a coming out arc and a new relationship with a co-worker, Maggie, played by Floriana Lima.\nThe relationship has been a point of joy, and in Monday night's episode Alex and Maggie celebrated their first Valentine's Day.\nAhead of the episode, Leigh talked to Mic about Supergirl , Alex's coming out story, divisive responses and the importance of getting the character's queerness right. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nSource: YouTube Mic: You've talked previously about all of the positive responses you've received to Alex's storyline. Have those continued to flow in, or has reaction gotten more divisive?\nChyler Leigh (CL): It's really been interesting: Because there's been so much positivity towards it, when there's a little bit more of a negative [reaction] ... it's been a challenge, in a good way. We're doing our jobs well. Not everyone is going to agree — clearly — and not everyone is going to be affected the same way.\nLast season, people who were watching the show, they were watching it on CBS. We were the only show like that on the network. Being able to switch over to the CW gave us enough room to grow and explore storylines. ... That being the case, to be able to [execute] this storyline? We had a great opportunity to do it justice. Of course that's going to stir the pot.\nWhat in particular about this story has stirred the pot?\nCL: [Viewers] have been watching this show with their families, with their kids. Some of the responses we've gotten have been, \"Well, we did watch with our young children, but now that this storyline has come up, we're not letting them watch anymore.\" What I've learned, even just for myself, is that it really creates an opportunity to open up a conversation that you might not normally have had with your kids, your friends or your family . People are getting less and less afraid of talking about it. Even if they haven't embraced it ... at least it's a conversation we're having.\nI have three kids. My son, who's 13 now, he sat down with me and watched every single episode last season. He was so excited to watch everything this season, and I had to preface. I had to say, \"You know, buddy, there's a different storyline now. This is what's going on.\" At first, he was questioning why they would do that, and it was an opportunity for me to say that this is where we are in the world. You're going to become exposed to that earlier, because people are having that conversation earlier. It allowed me to help him open up and see a bigger perspective — a bigger picture.\nYou can't make everyone happy, but I know we've made a heck of a lot more people happy than we have unhappy. That's what I'm focused on.", "external_links": ["https://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/supergirl-is-the-most-progressive-show-on-television", "http://www.tvinsider.com/112738/chyler-leigh-on-how-alexs-coming-out-on-supergirl-has-inspired-thousands/112738/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFU658CHyIA"], "published": "2017-02-14T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:41:18.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
