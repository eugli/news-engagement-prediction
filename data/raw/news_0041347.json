On patrol with the Iraqi forces driving ISIS terrorists from Mosul Wednesday, 18th January 2017 The city of Mosul has been an ISIS stronghold since they took control of the city in January 2014. The Iraqi army claim to have taken it back, and defeated the Islamist terrorists. 1 / 12 AFP/Getty Images CTS soldiers fatigued from battle. \nA statement from the depleted terror cell reads: \"The martyrdom-seeking brother – may Allah accept him – detonated his explosives-laden vehicle on a headquarters of the Rafidhi army and its militias in southwest Mosul.\" \nThe statement also claims that the attack caused many casualties, but this has not been verified. \nLike Sally Jones, the terrorist recruiter , Brits in ISIS often use the al-Britani moniker. \nTWITTER PROPAGANDA: Jones often spouts ISIS rubbish \nAfter being driven back by coalition forces, the sick terror group is resorting to increasingly desperate tactics to try and save themselves. \nTens of thousands of soldiers have launched an all-out offensive on remaining ISIS strongholds in Mosul to finish them off for good. \nAfter retaking the east side of the city, the US-led coalition has now encircled the beleaguered terror group in the west bank, and are moving in for the kill. \nBut this has not worked out too well, as footage from Syria showed an ISIS idiot detonate his suicide vest too early, killing no one but himself.
