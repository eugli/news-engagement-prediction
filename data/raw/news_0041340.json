Emma Watson plays young Belle, the smart and savvy village girl whose brave attempt to save her father brings her in contact with the hidden-away Beast (Dan Stevens). \nIn the clip, Belle comes into contact with the village baker, schoolmaster and a variety of other townsfolk, none of whom are quite sure what to make of the bookworm in their midst. \nThe movie is scheduled for a March 17 release date in the US and UK, and will come to Australia on March 23.
