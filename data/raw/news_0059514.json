It is unclear why he was released at that time since, as ICE stated on Wednesday, Honduras had filed an arrest warrant for him in 2005. \nThe Obama administration released him, despite the fact that he was wanted for hacking two men to death and there was a pending warrant out on him. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); \nICE did not explain why Escober was released in 2011. \nBut it’s very clear that ICE now has a much clearer and more direct mission. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-1'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-3'); }); \n“ICE is focused on identifying, arresting and removing public safety threats, such as convicted criminal aliens and gang members, as well as individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws,” Sean Gallagher, ICE’s Atlanta field office director, said in a statement. \n“ICE Fugitive Operations Teams conduct targeted enforcement operations toward these identified threats to public safety. North Carolina residents are safer today thanks to the professionalism and hard work of these dedicated officers.” \nThis is the kind of person that leftists protesters are fighting to keep in the country? \nWe are now all a little safer, now that the law is, once again, the law.
