An alternate in the six-woman tag match possibility would be Stephanie McMahon joining the heels over Dana Brooke. \nThis would allow WWE to build on the program they started between Rousey and Stephanie two WrestleManias ago. \nSome other opportunities being discussed for Ronda are less likely to excite the WWE community. She has been bandied about as a possible commentator for future UFC shows. She is also still being mentioned for film roles, such as the still-upcoming Roadhouse remake. \nWhatever she tries, it is becoming more and more apparent, based on interviews with Dana White and even Rousey’s own mother , that her days inside an MMA cage are over. \n— MMA mania (@mmamania) January 31, 2017 \nWhile Rousey has received a great deal of criticism from the general public for her handling of the two losses — media blackouts, refusing to congratulate her conquerors, and not giving post-fight interviews or appear at post-fight press conferences — she remains a bonafide superstar with crossover appeal. \nSome fans love what she did for the sport, while others simply want to see her humbled. \nWith the specter of her unbeaten streak now behind her, White indicated in the closing segment, she will be able to tackle the next career challenge fresh. \nAnd as for money, “she has all she’ll ever need,” White said, adding that she “isn’t a big spender like Floyd (Mayweather).” \nSo   Is this an “official” retirement announcement? And what would you like to see next from Ronda Rousey?   \n[Featured Image by UFC ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:30:29.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
