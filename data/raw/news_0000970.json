Image copyright Reuters Image caption If the scheme is successful. it will be extended \n\"We're re-using two waste products... to make something that really will make plants grow,\" Uritrottoir co-designer Laurent Lebot, told the Reuters news agency. \nMr Lebot said that bigger versions of his device could absorb the urine of 600 people before they needed to be emptied. \nParts of Paris have long had a reputation for smelling strongly of urine, dating back to its emergence centuries ago from swamps adjoining the river Seine. \nSupporters of the scheme quoted by The Local say that the urinals provide a more convivial environment, especially when compared to the numerous grey and overflowing street urinals that can be found all over the centre of Paris. \nThey say it should help to discourage men from urinating elsewhere in public. \n\"People urinating on the streets of France is a serious problem,\" co-designer Victor Massip told The Local. \n\"We knew there was a big demand for a solution, so we've come up with one. \n\"People are laughing, many of them are amazed, but most agree that it's a good idea to test out.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T18:25:30.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
