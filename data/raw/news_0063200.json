A jack-knifed car transporter on the M80 near Banknock during early morning snowfall. \nHe added: \"The whole system will still be over the UK, right through the afternoon. The winds then will start to ease from the West through this evening.\" \nAmber warnings predicting strong winds and heavy rain are in place for North Wales, the Midlands, the East and the North West and have been extended to include the London area. \nThe Met Office's amber warning alerts people that \"whilst the strongest winds look to be only short-lived, damage to structures, interruptions to power supplies and widespread disruption to travel networks are likely, with a danger of injury from flying debris\". \nGusts of 60mph-70mph are likely in affected areas, with 70mph-80mph expected on coasts and hills. \nStorm Doris was branded a \"weather bomb\" after the system underwent \"explosive cyclogenesis\", the Met Office said. \n\"It has gone through what they call explosive cyclogenesis - so a deepening of 24mb in 24 hours,\" a spokesman said. \n\"Storm Doris is still Storm Doris, it does not mean it is necessarily any more severe than we had forecast already.\" \nAer Lingus cancelled 12 flights between the UK and the Republic of Ireland and Heathrow Airport has warned customers to check their flights before travelling. \nNetwork Rail has warned of delays and cancellations after imposing speed restrictions. \nThe are 50mph limits on some services run by Southeastern, Arriva Trains Wales, Chiltern Railways, Grand Central, TransPennine Express and Virgin Trains East Coast. \nBritain is expected to be battered by winds of up to 80mph at the storm's peak and Highways England has issued a weather alert on major roads. \nParticularly at risk are high-sided vehicles, caravans and motorbikes, and drivers are \"strongly advised\" to avoid travelling on some stretches of road in Yorkshire, the Midlands, the East and the North West.
