I felt pathetic, well I was pathetic. 'And I went in the archway and just sat with my head down, because I didn't want people to see me and I didn't want to see anybody else. Mr Webb (left), a former gunner in the Royal Artillery, was an alcoholic living on the streets of Carlisle in Cumbria and said he felt 'pathetic' - but then he was helped by Mr Finlayson (right) 'It was a miracle because I thought this stranger or this angel has come to help me. So I owe it to him, but more so I owe it to myself.' Mr Webb taught sociology before his marriage fell apart, he lost his job and he turned to alcohol. But Mr Finlayson helped him and put him up in a B&B. He then got the Royal British Legion involved, which helped get him a permanent home and rebuild his life. Now he is doing an IT course and voluntary work. Mr Finlayson told the programme: 'I've seen that look before and that's when you know someone's at rock bottom. I'd love to hear from him and meet him.' Mr Webb taught sociology before his marriage fell apart, he lost his job and he turned to drink Then, when the reporter reunited them in the cafe, an emotional Mr Webb told Mr Finlayson: 'I just want to tell you what you've done for me. 'You've done everything for me. I just thought I couldn't get any lower and I didn't really have any friends. 'And just the loneliness and despair I was feeling and then you came along. I can't thank you enough, I really can't, you've just changed my life.' It comes a day after MailOnline told the story of David Simons , a former homeless man who was living on the streets and begging for food and cash one year ago. He has undergone a dramatic transformation in the space of just 12 months thanks to a homeless charity in Chester and has now got a job at a garden centre. The story of Phil Webb and Stephen Finlayson can be viewed on the BBC iPlayer .
