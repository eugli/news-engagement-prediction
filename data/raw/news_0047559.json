Madhavan and Amit Sadh to star in the upcoming web series “Breathe”.”I am extremely happy, but also nervous to be part of this web series,” Anuj, best known for his roles in TV shows like “Sabki Laadli Bebo” and “Swaragini”, said in a statement. \n“The story is very interesting and I am getting to work with seasoned actors which is certainly a career high for me. Web series is gaining a lot of momentum in this country right now and it feels good to be part of this new transition,” he added. Talking about his role, Anuj said: “All I can say is I play the role of a painter. That’s a first for me.” Produced by Abundantia Entertainment and directed by Mayank Sharma, “Breathe” will be aired on Amazon Prime. \nAnuj says he is very critical when it comes to judging his own work. “I am over-critical of myself. Although I think it’s good to be that way. My friends feel that I should appreciate myself too, especially when I have done a good job in a scene or a film,” Anuj told IANS last year. \nHaving starred in shows like “Sabki Laadli Bebo”, “Phir Subah Hogi”, “Chhanchhan” and “Itti Si Khushi”, Anuj is a popular face in the TV industry. Asked if he wants to stick to films now, Anuj said: “Honestly, I haven’t planned this out. I have always gone with the flow and will continue to do so. Having said that, when you do one film, you get greedy for more. I have now done two, of course I would love to do many more.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:41:37.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
