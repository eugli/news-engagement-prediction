Picture: Gary Ramage \nA target to halve the gap for indigenous children in reading, writing and numeracy by 2018 is not on track, but the numbers are within reach. Efforts to halve the gap in Year 12 attainment among indigenous Australians by 2020 are on track, but a push to halve the gap in employment outcomes between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians by 2018 is not. \nJackie Huggins, co-chair of the National Congress of Australia’s First People’s, said far more needed to be done to stem the “horrible” statistics underpinning indigenous disadvantage and it was time to draw a line in the sand. “While there have been some positive changes the negatives totally overpower this in relation to where we are heading as a community,” Ms Huggins told reporters at Parliament House. \n“We say enough is enough, it is not good enough, and we deserve much better.” The federal government must start listening to indigenous people. “Without investing in them, without adequately resourcing them, things will not change,” Ms Huggins said. \n“Listen to our people, walk with our people.” Indigenous leaders on Tuesday morning delivered the prime minister a blueprint for resetting government relations and curbing disadvantage among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. \nThe Redfern Statement — backed by more than 30 organisations — calls for dozens of changes across health, justice, disability, education and family violence based on genuine engagement with indigenous communities. \nIt urges the reversal of federal budget cuts, targets to reduce incarceration rates and family violence, and a stand alone department for indigenous affairs. Mr Turnbull said the government was committed to doing things with indigenous Australians, not to them. \n“As we work together as a nation, all levels of government, to renew the Closing the Gap targets, input from the Redfern Statement alliance will be critically important,” he said. \nThe government will redesign the expiring targets in partnership with indigenous people. \n“We’ll work to ensure that the Closing the Gap initiatives are community-driven and recognise that indigenous leaders are absolutely central — paramount — to finding the solutions in a way that supports identity and wellbeing,” Mr Turnbull said. media_camera Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says Australia cannot shy away from the stark reality that we are not seeing sufficient national progress on the Closing the Gap targets.

Greater empowerment of local communities will deliver the shared outcomes we all seek.” \nMr Turnbull announced an indigenous commissioner would be appointed to the Productivity Commission to evaluate programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. \n“We must have a rigorous evaluation of programs so we know what is working and what is not,” he said in making the announcement. \nThe federal government will pump $50 million into policy research and implementation, in partnership with the indigenous Advisory Council. “The data and the research we have, and the evidence we need to build, will be made available to indigenous communities to empower leadership and support community-led programs,” the prime minister said. \n“It will assist government in its next phase of closing the gap, which must focus on regional action and outcomes.” \nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten said closing the disadvantage gap demanded a new approach. \nAustralia must forget the insulting fiction that the First Australians are a problem to be solved. \n“And instead, a new approach, to listen to people who stand on the other side of the gap,” he told parliament. \n“A new approach that, from now on, the First Australians must have first say in the decisions that shape their lives.” media_camera Opposition Leader Bill Shorten says Parliament must agree on a meaningful way forward for Constitutional change this year. Picture: AAP Image/Lukas Coch \nBoth Mr Turnbull and Mr Shorten signalled 2017 as a year of change where the Parliament would finally agree on a referendum to amend the Constitution to recognise indigenous Australians. \nLater in the year the Referendum Council will report to Parliament on its recommendations on the wording for the referendum. \nThe Prime Minister used his address to affirm the Government’s commitment to changing the constitution, saying the task was not for the faint-hearted. \nMr Shorten said Parliament would need to agree on a meaningful way forward this year. \nIt was time for a new story, he said. \n“You do not belong in a jail cell for an offence that carries an $80 fine,” Mr Shorten said. \n“You do not belong strapped into a chair with a hood on your head. \n“You do not belong on the back of a windowless van away from your family and loved ones. “You do not belong in a bureaucrat’s office, begging for money. \n“You do not belong on the streets with nowhere to go. \n“You belong here, as members of Parliament, as leaders of this nation. \n“You belong in the Constitution, recognised at last.” \nChanges must be made to the justice system to make progress on closing the gap, Indigenous Health Minister Ken Wyatt said. \nThe Minister, who made history this year as the first indigenous Australian to hold a Cabinet position in federal Parliament, also said Australians must confront the reality of racism for there to be any progress in health targets. \nAnd more needed to be done in the early years to improve education outcomes, he said. \n“Part of our challenge are the social determinants,” Mr Wyatt told ABC after the report was handed down. media_camera Ken Wyatt wants to help close the gap on our indigenous population. Picture: Troy Snook \n“Racism, and that’s a reality we have to face as a country, is an issue in preventing people accessing the tiers of health. \n“And the journey into hospitals, that is critical in terms of making sure that the pathway to treatment is as consistent as that for any other Australian.” \nMr Wyatt said indigenous Australians were not “violent and unregulated”, incarceration rates were largely due to the circumstance people found themselves in and their reactions to feelings of frustration and futility. \n“There are individuals who do commit crimes that need to face the consequences of their behaviour but even some of the incarceration numbers feature those who drive without a vehicle in the bush, who then can’t pay their fines and end up within prisons,” he said. \n“We’ve gotta find better ways and options.” \nThere had also been “knee-jerk reactions” to law and order such as the three-strike legislation in some states and territories that needed to be looked at. \nMr Wyatt said more would be done with the states and territories to prevent another stolen generation through removals into child protection. \n“But equally the bottom line has to be that we cannot leave some children who are at incredible risk in their environment,” he said. \n“We’ve gotta look at what’s a local solution and how families and the kinship family, and extended family, play a role in this as well.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:02:47.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
