I was very open with you in the answer.\n“I don’t want him to leave.”\nRooney has started just one game in the last nine.\nHe has 18 months left on his current $406,000 (£250,000) per week deal, but United do not seem keen to take up their option to extend it for a year.\nThe striker, who has missed the last two games due to a combination of root canal surgery on a tooth and a muscle problem, rejoined his teammates in training on Wednesday.\nBut the United and England skipper could only take part in the warm-up and Mourinho opted to leave him at home when the Red Devils travelled to Saint Etienne for the second leg of their Europa League last 32 second leg game.\nMourinho added: “Yes, he was doing the warming up and the basic things after warming up, but then when the training session was higher in intensity, he was not training. No chance for tomorrow, he is not here, he stayed back training, and let’s see for the weekend.”\nRooney trying to explain how many zeros were on his contract offer.

The Red Devils paid a transfer fee of $44 million (£27million) when they signed him from Everton in 2004. English newspapers have reported Chinese clubs could be willing to pay United up to $49 million (£30 million) to recruit Rooney before his current deal expires.\nThe deal would see Rooney return to the top spot on the list of the highest-paid footballers on the planet, leap-frogging Carlos Tevez (Shanghai Shenhua) and Oscar (Shanghai SIPG), who both recently moved to China.\nTevez only last year became the highest paid player on the planet when he signed with Shanhai Shenua for $1 million (£615,000) per week deal.\nRooney is set to earn more than 50 per cent more than any player has ever earned per week to play football.\nWORLD’S HIGHEST PAID FOOTBALLERS \nCarlos Tevez has reason to smile.
