I certainly consider myself to be one of them, people who were sexually active younger.’ He was speaking on the Drunken Peasants podcast (Picture: AP) \nCalling the age of consent an ‘arbitrary’ number, he then goes on to claim that gay men are more likely to engage in paedophilia. President's Day renamed 'Not My President's Day' by protesters \n‘In the homosexual world, particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men – the sort of “coming of age” relationship – those relationships in which those older men help those young boys discover who they are and give them security and safety, and provide them with love, and a reliable, sort of rock, where they can’t speak to their parents.’ \nWhen one of the presenters interrupted and said ‘this sounds like priest molestation to me’, Yiannopoulos doubled down. \n‘You know what? I’m grateful to Father Michael. I wouldn’t give nearly as good head if it wasn’t for him.’ \nIn a Facebook video that was on his page for a few hours on Monday before being deleted, Milo did not deny the claims, but said his comments were ‘stupidly worded’. \n‘I find those crimes [child abuse] to be absolutely disgusting. I find people to be absolutely disgusting.’ \nSimon & Schuster has spent around two months defending its decision to publish Yiannopoulos’ autobiography, despite calls for it to be dropped because of his very public racism, Islamophobia and misogyny.
