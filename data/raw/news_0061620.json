(Arnold Turner/Invision/AP/Kevin Johnson/Press Line Photos/)  10 AM \nDarius McCrary's estranged wife alleges that the former \"Family Matters\" actor has been abusive towards her and their one-year-old daughter, Zoey. \nIn court documents, Tammy Brawner asked a judge for a restraining order detailing horrific incidents in which McCrary allegedly threatened his family, E! News reported . \nIn one incident, Brawner said the 40-year-old actor held their baby over a pot of boiling water while screaming that he wished she was never born. \nBrawner also claimed McCrary would strap Zoey's arms down during meals and frequently spanked the infant. \n'Family Matters' star Darius McCrary arrested in Michigan \nAccording to Brawner, on Feb. 10 McCrary got so angry that he started throwing picture frames around the house almost hitting their daughter. \nBrawner said McCrary was also abusive towards her and almost struck her in the head with his forearm. \nShe said the violent episodes were sparked by McCrary's alleged excessive drinking and drug use. \nBased on the restraining order, the troubled Hollywood star, who played Eddie Winslow on the '90s sitcom, has to stay at least 100 yards away from Brawner and the baby. \nHe also had to move out of their home and is banned from any type of visitation until after a March court hearing. A post shared by Darius McCrary (@dariusmccrary) on Feb 22, 2017 at 3:29pm PST \nMcCrary, who was previously accused of abusing ex-wife Karrine Steffans , responded to Brawner's allegations posting a photo on Instagram of him and their daughter Zoey. \n\"Yea right... sad some people will do ANYTHING make #TMZ,\" he wrote. \nThe actor also posted several other pictures of him with Zoey, including a shot of him kissing the infant on the cheek. \nMcCrary’s attorney Glen T. Jonas denied the allegations saying Brawner is not a victim and is trying to extort money from the actor “while trying to create an advantage in an impending divorce and custody battle.” \n“McCrary is a loving, devoted and dedicated father,” the statement continued. “Her allegations are such obvious and outlandish lies…we are all dumber for having read them. Having floundered after being fired by the globetrotters she apparently will say anything for a bit of media attention and glimpse of the spotlight.” Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:44:06.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
