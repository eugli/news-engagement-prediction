All of our hard work is really paying off and we can feel the love from our fans and the ACMs. To be in the entertainer of the year category is a dream come true — just to be nominated — so it motivates us to continue to work hard and push ourselves to be better artists, better husbands, better guys —all that stuff. It’s gonna be a big night for us. It feels like a big year, so we’re just excited to be a part of country music and the ACMs again. It feels great. \nBrian Kelley : I was blown away. We’re just humbled. Five nominations is a ton and that feels really, really good. We work really hard; we spend a lot of time away from our families and we’ve put a lot into this thing because we love it, we love our fans and we love our music — we love this life that we get to live. It already feels like we’re winners, so to know that we’re nominated next to a whole bunch of people that we look up to — our friends, peers and legends — it’s crazy that we’re up in the mix still. God is really, really good to us.

He pulled it up real quick on his phone and we were in the top nominees for the ACMs. It was a big morning. It felt really cool and got us super excited for ACM night.

(laughs) \nA post shared by Florida Georgia Line (@flagaline) on Jan 10, 2017 at 7:34am PST \nAnd your new song “God, Your Mama, and Me” featuring Backstreet Boys is flying up the charts. This must be a childhood dream to get to work with them. \nKelley : You wanna know something crazy? Sixth grade House of Blues Orlando, Florida was my first concert ever — it was the Backstreet Boys. I got to go with a friend for my best buddy’s younger sister’s birthday. We got to somehow ride in a limo out to Orlando and got to see the Backstreet Boys play a little show. It was crazy. It was awesome, totally inspiring, and to see it come full circle really reminds us to keep dreaming, to dream big, to put out positive energy into the universe, shine your light, and try as hard as you can at whatever you’re great at and great things will happen. \nThat’s what we were reminded of when making this album — whatever success may come, you just keep dreaming and stay true to who you are, and go back to the well for more inspiring. I think choosing the Backstreet Boys was a very natural decision. They were Tyler’s first CD back in the day and they were everywhere.

It starts next month and the ACMs are in Vegas too… \nHubbard : Oh, that’s cool. That’s gonna be fun! You mean their Vegas residency or ours?
