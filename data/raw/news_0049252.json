A + A - (AP Photo) \nThe Border-Gavaskar series is always an intense affair with both India and Australia giving their best on the field to claim the glorious trophy. Over the years cricket fans have had the pleasure to witness some of the most closely fought Test matches. \nIndia and Australia are now getting ready to renew their rivalry on the field in the upcoming four-match Test series which starts from February 23. Players from both sides have already started to play mind games with their statements in the press conferences. \nThe quality of cricket is so intense that players often get into altercations and verbal wars on the field. There is no margin for error and that is why from time to time both teams have tried to get on top of the opposition by resorting to sledging and playing with the batsmen's minds. \nThere have been some unfortunate and controversial incidents in the past which are hard to overlook ahead of the series. \nSo let's take a look at five of the most controversial episodes from the past: \nMonkeygate scandal (Reuters Photo) \nThe monkeygate scandal is perhaps the worst incident which took place between India and Australia and certainly one of the most unfortunate episodes in international cricket. \nIt was during the second Test of the 2007-08 Border-Gavaskar series in Sydney when India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh got into an ugly verbal spat with Australia all-rounder Andrew Symonds and with reputed players like Sachin Tendulkar , Matthew Hayden, Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke also getting involved in it. \nIt was on the third day of the Test when Harbhajan had just reached his half-century when his altercation with Symonds occurred and the latter accused the Indian cricketer of racially abusing him by calling him a monkey. To which Harbhajan pleaded not guilty at the hearing after the match but was subsequently handed a three-match ban by match referee Mike Proctor. India lost the Test match under controversial circumstances with umpires Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson being publically criticised by Indian players and the media for their poor decisions in the match. \nIndia also appealed against Harbhajan's ban and were even contemplating boycotting the rest of the series until he was cleared of the charges but they decided to play the remaining Test matches and even defeated Australia in the third Test at Perth. Harbhajan was later acquitted of the racism charges in an independent ICC hearing but was fined 50% of his match fee for using abusive language. \nDavid Warner to Rohit Sharma: 'Speak English' (Reuters Photo) \nAustralia opener David Warner is famous for two things - his aggressive batting style and sledging the opposition players. \nWarner was in the thick of things once again and got into trouble later on when he was heard on the stumps mikes telling Rohit Sharma to 'speak English' in a heated argument during the second ODI of the tri-series in January, 2015. \nThe Australian fielders had taken offence when the Indians went for a single off an overthrow which they wrongly believed was in breach of cricket etiquette. \n\"When I went over to say something to him, he sort of said something in their language and I said 'speak English' because, if you're going to say something for me to understand, theoretically I cannot speak Hindi,\" Warner had said after the match but went on to lose 50 per cent of his match fee for his actions. \nVirat Kohli's send-off to Steve Smith (Cricket Australia Photo) \nAustralians often target the best batsman in the opposition and try to unsettle the player by sledging or playing mind games in the press conferences. That is why Virat Kohli has been in the centre of quite a few controversies also involving the Australian team. \nRight from him showing his middle finger to the crowd in Sydney on his first tour Down Under in 2012 to the Aussies calling him a spoilt brat in the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne in 2014, Kohli has seen it all. The Indian captain, who has calmed down considerably ever since he was handed the responsibility of leading the team, had even stated after the MCG Test, \"I like playing against Australia because it's very hard for them to stay calm. I don't mind an argument on the field. I respect a few of them but if someone doesn't respect me I've got no reason to respect them.\" \nLast year during a T20I match in Adelaide Kohli lost his cool and gave Australia captain Steve Smith a verbal send-off while making a \"chatterbox\" gesture. Kohli later explained that Smith was having a go at India's junior bowlers and he even told the umpires to keep an eye out otherwise he would have to step in, which he did later on. Smith was not impressed with Kohli's actions and said that the send-off he got shouldn't have a place on the cricket field. \nGautam Gambhir elbows Shane Watson (AP Photo) \nIt was Australia's turn to face the heat when they came to India in 2008 for the Border-Gavaskar series and they had to face a lot taunts and abuse from the home crowd. India opener Gautam Gambhir, who is known for losing his cool at the drop of a hat on the field, got into trouble once again when he shoved his left elbow at Australia all-rounder Shane Watson while taking a run during the third Test in Delhi. \nWatson, who was bowling at the time, appeared to have irked Gambhir by saying something when he was taking a run to which Gambhir replied by pushing his elbow into Watson's chest while taking the second run. Gambhir later claimed that it was an accident but he was slapped with a one-match ban under the ICC Code of Conduct's Level 2 offence for not playing the game within the spirit and laws. \nMichael Slater's rant against Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid (YouTube Photo) \nThe 2001 Border-Gavaskar series is famous for India's come-from-behind victory and is known to be the greatest series triumph India has ever registered. The series really turned around Indian cricket forever thanks to the manner in which the home team won the second and the third Test to clinch the series 2-1. \nAustralia, being led by Steve Waugh, were on a roll at the time and were heading to India having achieved the record of winning 15 consecutive Test matches. They stretched the record to 16 matches by defeating India in the first Test in Mumbai at the Wankhede stadium. \nBut apart from India's loss, it was Michael Slater's verbal rant against Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid which made the headlines. It was during the third day's play when Dravid mistimed a pull shot and was caught by Slater but his appeal was turned down by the third umpire. Furious Slater then walked up to umpire S Venkatraghavan and argued the decision with him and then turned to Dravid, who stood his ground, as he had a right to, and exchanged hot words with him. \nSlater also had a go at Tendulkar, who was batting at the other end but he later apologised after the match for his abusive language. Slater was let off with a warning from the ICC match referee Cammie Smith.
