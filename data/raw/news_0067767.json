The media company is still attending the dinner itself, but isn’t doing an afterparty: \nA Bloomberg spokesperson told us: “We surveyed some of the past attendees and didn’t get as much interest in a party this year as we’ve had in the past, so we decided to focus on the dinner and the WHCA.” \nPresident Trump ‘s recent attacks on the press have stirred more public debate about whether news outlets should show up to the dinner. BuzzFeed reported yesterday that CNN has been discussing whether to attend or not. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:25:52.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
