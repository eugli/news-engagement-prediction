At times, he promoted positions that could have been ripped from the playbook of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\nAdvertisement\n“The GOP will be from now on the party also of the American worker,” Trump declared.\nHe added, “First, we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is and what it actually represents. The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that will put its own citizens first.”\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller.

At his first appearance at the conference in 2011, Trump walked out to the song “Money” and drew laughs and boos from the crowd. Last year, Trump declined an invitation to speak at the event. On Friday, he explained that absence by saying he worried his ideas would be “too controversial.”\nThis time the crowd reveled in chants of “lock her up.” And White House counselor Kellyanne Conway’s joke earlier in the week that CPAC should be renamed “TPAC” in honor of the president seemed more fitting.\nAdvertisement\nTrump hit his usual talking points. He bashed the Affordable Care Act, blamed former President Barack Obama for leaving him with “a mess,” and promised to halt illegal immigration. But as he gears up to deliver a speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, lawmakers are going to be looking for more specifics, namely how to fund all his proposals.\nTrump did not once mention his nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court in his speech, a surprising omission given the choice was widely heralded by conservatives. He did however deliver a blistering critique of the media, attacking “fake news” and journalists’ use of anonymous sources.\n“It doesn’t represent the people, it never will represent the people and we’re going to do something about it,” Trump said about the media. “Many of these groups are part of large media corporations that have their own agenda.’’\nHis attack on the media’s use of anonymous sources came less than an hour after White House officials held a background briefing — demanding anonymity — with journalists to dispute a CNN story that reported White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus asked the FBI to push back against media reports about communications between Trump’s associates and Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump also has shown a penchant for anonymous sources, tweeting in 2012 that “an extremely credible source” told him Obama’s birth certificate was fake.\nSoon after Trump’s promise to “do something about’’ the media, the Trump team took the highly unusual step of excluding CNN, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and some other news outlets from an off-camera press briefing called a “gaggle’’ in spokesman Sean Spicer’s office.\nTrump’s speech Friday was a less extreme version of the worldview expressed by Steve Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, who spoke Thursday about the “deconstruction of the administrative state.” Bannon, making a rare public appearance, took the stage with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the two played down any sort of conflict between them.\nBut, ahead of Trump’s speech, attendees at CPAC on Thursday were still coming to grips with Trump’s new Republican Party and wrestling with questions of whether the president is a true conservative.\n“He has evolved and he understands the importance of the values of the conservative moment,” said Kirk Lippold, who was the commanding officer of the USS Cole when it was bombed in 2000. “I think that while Donald Trump was elected because they believe he is a conservative, they are watching him do things that now support that.”\nMatt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, the group that hosts CPAC, agreed, pointing to Trump’s first month in office as evidence of his conservative principles.\nHowever, William Temple, of Brunswick, Georgia, who was attending his eighth CPAC, this time in colonial garb, said Trump isn’t a conservative, but a populist. Nonetheless, Temple said he’s still been pleased with Trump’s first month in office.\n“Because what he is doing is everything I wanted Ted Cruz to do including the Supreme Court, rebuilding the military, building the wall, stopping illegal immigrants from coming into the country,” he said.\nTyler Pager can be reached at tyler.pager@globe.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F24%2Fdonald-trump-claims-remake-gop-party-american-worker%2FPeF6IjybU9C77idKYgIshK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Donald", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Donald", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/23/politics/fbi-refused-white-house-request-to-knock-down-recent-trump-russia-stories/", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F24%2Fdonald-trump-claims-remake-gop-party-american-worker%2FPeF6IjybU9C77idKYgIshK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F24%2Fdonald-trump-claims-remake-gop-party-american-worker%2FPeF6IjybU9C77idKYgIshK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Donald", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F24%2Fdonald-trump-claims-remake-gop-party-american-worker%2FPeF6IjybU9C77idKYgIshK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tDonald"], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T08:10:44.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
