'I wasn't trying to make history' \nMs Herbst's honesty policy ensured her stamp on history in becoming the first transgender mayor in the conservative state. \n\"I don't think that this would be history if I were in any other place in the world, even other states in the United States,\" she said. \n\"But people perceive the state of Texas as being so far to the right, so conservative, that they just seemed shocked by it. \n\"I wasn't trying to make history, I was just trying to be real and be honest.\" \nComing out publicly as transgender has been well received by the community and Mrs Herbst's own family. \n\"I've been married for 36 years [and] my wife has known of my tendencies since before we were married,\" she said. \n\"It would be unfair to say that she knew I was transgender; at that point I didn't know the word 'transgender' and neither did she. \nMs Herbst said she kept the change from her daughters until they were 18. \n\"My eldest daughter I told first and she was on my side instantly,\" she said. \nMs Herbst's political priorities include protecting the rights and safety of transgender individuals. \nShe has come out strongly against the so-called 'bathroom bill' which, if passed by the Texas legislature, prohibits transgender people using public toilets corresponding with their gender identity. \n\"There is no merit whatsoever to the bathroom bill — they've never found anyone that has ever attacked anyone, as much as they tried. \n\"It [the bathroom bill] has crippled North Carolina and it'll do the same thing to Texas.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:30:50.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
