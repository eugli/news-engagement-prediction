(New York Daily News) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   5:05 PM \nThe Brooklyn federal judge who temporarily halted President Trump's immigration ban urged newly sworn American citizens on Tuesday to be “active participants\" in their country's affairs. \nThree days after Judge Ann Donnelly granted an emergency stay blocking the removal of individuals legally authorized to enter from countries like Iraq, Somalia and Syria, the judge happened to be presiding over the day's naturalization ceremonies. \nIt was a duty Donnelly called the \"happiest and nicest things we judges do.\" \nShe made no mention of the blockbuster Saturday evening ruling in the case, which has been reassigned. Protesters rally in NYC against Trump's travel ban \nBut the judge discussed immigration, citizenship and referred to former President Barack Obama's farewell letter where the outgoing President talked about the \"joyous work of citizenship.\" \nDonnelly, a state court judge and longtime Manhattan prosecutor before joining the federal bench, asked the approximately 100 new citizens to vote, serve on juries, “speak out on issues of importance to you\" and also \"dream big.\" \nDonnelly pointed to the ceremonial courtroom's Depression-era mural, which shows immigrants hard at work building railroads, farming and doing other heavy labor.

The case and other related actions have been randomly reassigned to Judge Carol Bagley Amon. \nProtesters rally in lower Manhattan against Trump’s travel ban \nBoris Denadic, 35, was one of the newly minted citizens who heard Donnelly. \nDenadic said he felt happy to call himself an American citizen. He said he spent more than one third of his life in the United States \"so I feel like I belong here.\" Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:35:05.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
