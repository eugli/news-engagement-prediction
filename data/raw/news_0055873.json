The three attackers attempted to enter the court premises in Tangi town through the main gate. They opened fire and threw grenades, prompting retaliatory fire by security forces deployed there. \nOne bomber was killed in the firing at the gate and the second was killed as he entered the court. The third bomber died when he detonated his explosives, officials said. Such terrorist attack was expected in #Charsadda as it is located near border: @SirajOfficial — Dunya News (@DunyaNews) February 21, 2017 \nAccording to DPO Charsadda Sohail Khalid, three suicide bombers tried to enter the court premises, but security forces shot them dead. \n\"One suicide bomber blew himself at the gate of the local court. All three terrorists have been killed. As per information, 3-4 people have been injured in the attack,\" the DPO said. \nDeputy Commissioner of Charsadda said judges and lawyers were safe. He said due to tight security the bombers could not enter the court, but had they been successful in entering the premises it \"would have been a catastrophe\". A search and rescue operation was underway, he added. \nAs soon as authorities learnt about the incident, they rushed to the spot and cordoned off the area. An emergency has been declared in Charsadda hospitals. \n\nCharsadda is almost 40 minutes away from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s capital Peshawar. \nThe province has been a target of terror attacks for nearly a decade. \nThe incident comes days after an ISIS suicide blast targeting a Sufi shrine in Sindh province left at least 70 dead. \nIn the last 10 days, over 100 people lost their lives in terror attacks in different parts of the country. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:27:00.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
