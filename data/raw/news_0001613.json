It was the country’s largest display of defiance since the fall of Communism in 1989.\nThe government’s decree decriminalizes corruption involving less than the equivalent of $48,000. Government plans could also free officials jailed for corruption, as well as prisoners with short jail sentences.\nRomanian officials said their plans are meant to reduce prison overcrowding and update the criminal code. But critics of the leftist government led by Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu said officials are trying to release their allies who were charged with corruption.\nRomanian President Klaus Iohannis said Thursday he had filed a court challenge to declare the decree unconstitutional.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Fsee-the-massive-anti-corruption-protests-that-overtook-romanias-streets", "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-romania-president-idUSKBN15H0W3", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=See"], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T13:08:05.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
