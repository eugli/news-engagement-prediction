The two suspects ended up running away through Memorial Peace Park. \nInvestigators are now looking to speak with the man, hoping he can help identify the suspects. \nThe two alleged attackers are described as Caucasian, between 20 and 25, and weighing 120 pounds. \nOne woman was approximately 5 foot 8 inches tall, with sandy blond hair tied in a pony tail, wearing a dark-coloured shirt and black pants. The other was 5 foot 5 inches tall, wearing blue jeans and a white sweater. \nDan Herbranson with Ridge Meadows RCMP told Global News they have not determined if the attackers knew the victim, but believe the attack was a random incident. \nAnyone with information is asked to call Ridge Meadows RCMP or CRIME STOPPERS to remain anonymous. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
