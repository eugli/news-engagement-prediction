The National Safety Council released estimates Wednesday that 40,200 people died in motor vehicle crashes in 2016. It would be the first time that more than 40,000 people died on U.S. roads since before the Great Recession. \nThe estimate is a 6% increase in deaths from 2015, and the council pointed to low gas prices and an improving economy as contributors to the uptick. \nThe figures are likely not a surprise to traffic safety experts , as traffic deaths have risen dramatically in recent years. In 2015, the United States saw the largest increase in traffic deaths in 50 years -- 7.2% from the prior year. And earlier this year, the federal government projected 2016's numbers would continue the trend , with another major spike. \nRelated: Why more people are suddenly dying on U.S. roads \nU.S. roads are still significantly safer than decades ago. But traffic safety advocates are concerned with the recent uptick and have suggested interventions such as cracking down on distracted driving and drunk driving. \nThe National Safety Council also estimated the cost of traffic deaths, injuries and property damage was $432.5 billion in 2016. \nRelated: U.S. roads keep getting more dangerous \nThe council cautioned its estimate of 40,200 deaths is provisional and may be revised as more data emerges. \nCNNMoney (Washington)   15, 2017: 10:34 AM ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T17:53:44.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
