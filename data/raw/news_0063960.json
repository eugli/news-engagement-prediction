The Bruins (13-12) press all game — on made shots and missed ones — and shoot three-pointers. They sub out five players at a time in hockey-style line shifts.\n“We knew we couldn’t score 80 on them,” Herndon Coach Josh Headen said.\nA game with that many possessions would give Lake Braddock too many shots at the rim. The Bruins would run their opponent out of the gym. \nDown 13 in the second half, the Hornets (12-13) began to try to control the game’s tempo, to crash the glass for rebounds and work harder on offense for open shots by feeding 6-foot-5 junior post players Varone (17 points, 13 rebounds) and Noah Sweeney . The pair combined for 24 points in the second half. \nThe Hornets went on an 8-0 run with five minutes to play to take their first lead since the game’s first two field goals. Lake Braddock’s Corey Pelham (17 points) countered with a layup and a foul shot, and the Bruins led 77-76 with one minute left. \nOn the final possession, the Hornets put the ball in Harrington’s hands, and his runner glanced off the backboard, then front rim. \n“We just had to get something up on the glass,” Varone said.\nHarrington’s runner glanced off the backboard, then front rim. Varone swatted it back at the glass with his right hand and tried to tap in his miss with a push shot. Jaden Snead grabbed that rebound and fired a brick off the glass. Varone corralled it again and hit the winner. “No one can box him out,” Harrington said.\nAnd with three tries at a layup, Varone is going to hit one of them. \nElsewhere, Simon Mulaa scored 21 points as W.T. Woodson edged Patriot in double overtime, 76-73. . . . \nDaryl Mackey Jr.’s 33 points paced West Potomac to an 85-71 win over Stonewall Jackson. The Wolverines will face Madison, which defeated Battlefield, 85-58.\nCougars knock off the Titans The Oakton girls outscored T.C. Williams 22-16 in the fourth quarter to pull out a 50-44 win in Alexandria.
