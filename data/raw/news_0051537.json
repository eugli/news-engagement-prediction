They have two three-year-old boys together, the Daily Record reports. \nThis morning, Buffel posted a series of pictures on Instagram, showing him marking his 36th birthday with his adorable sons.

Nineteen little presents in a box. Sometimes the smallest things take up the most room in your heart.\" \nThe footballer's birthday - which he celebrated with a doughnut instead of a cake - comes less than a month after he lost his wife to cancer. \nThe Belgian midfielder, who ended a three-year Ibrox spell in 2008, married his longtime partner and mum to his twins last summer. \nBut in December, he revealed that Stephanie was battling bowel cancer.
