By Hannah Smothers Twitter @IvankaTrump Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Saturday night, as people filled airport terminals around the country to protest President Donald Trump's executive order that bans immigration and travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner dressed up in a tuxedo and silver dress and posted a captionless photo to Instagram and Twitter . The internet very quickly erupted in outrage over what seemed to be an incredible display of opulence at a time when Ivanka's dad was having people detained in airports, fighting to get into the country. — Geoff Crawley (@VoiceOfThePhan) January 29, 2017 Hi @MerriamWebster are you accepting new entries for the definition of “tone-deaf” pic.twitter.com/etNCd0HOHl — Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) January 29, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Now sources close to the couple are claiming Ivanka and Kushner had absolutely nothing to do with the travel ban or the resulting protest, because they were away from their computers, observing Shabbat. The couple are both Orthodox Jews and don't use technology or do any work between sundown Friday and sundown Saturday. Vanity Fair reports that Trump gave the executive order to ban immigrants and travelers from the seven Muslim-majority countries just minutes before sundown on Friday — at 4:42 p.m ., according to the New York Times, before the sun set in D.C. at 5:24 p.m. According to sources who spoke with Vanity Fair , the couple was entirely unaware of the uproar surrounding the executive order because it was made so soon before sundown, and so the couple couldn't have known about the protests that took over airports on Saturday because they were observing Shabbat. What's worth noting, however, is that Ivanka posted the photo to her Twitter account at 11:07 p.m . EST on Saturday — or a full five-and-a-half hours after sundown Saturday, when Shabbat was officially over. It's perhaps possible that no one at whatever opulent event the couple was attending in their fancy clothes was making small talk about the uproar surrounding an order Ivanka's dad made. But it's also not impossible to think that Ivanka and Jared might have checked their phones sometime in that five hour window, and seen that some thousands of Americans were screaming outside airport terminals to let people into the country. EIther way, the source told Vanity Fair that Ivanka \"feels just awful about advertising her opulent lifestyle at an inopportune moment.\" Follow Hannah on Twitter .
