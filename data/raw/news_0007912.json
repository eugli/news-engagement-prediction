(Photo: Jason Kempin, Getty Images for Comedy Central) \n\"What just happened?\" a startled Trevor Noah tweeted while watching the broadcast of his own program Tuesday night. \"Was that just my TV?\" \nHis Daily Show interview with Anthony D. Romero, the head of the American Civil Liberties Union, cut out unexpectedly as they were discussing President Trump's executive order temporarily suspending the U.S. refugee program and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries and the people affected by it. When the screen went to black, Romero was talking about Hameed Khalid Darweesh , an Iraqi translator who was detained for 18 hours at New York's JFK airport over the weekend. The Comedy Central logo remained at the bottom of the screen. #Dailyshow cut to black mid interview with Executive Director of ACLU Anthony Romero while discussing trump and Muslim ban. pic.twitter.com/tpLzlKtAmJ \nA relieved Noah later provided an update: \"Just a broadcast glitch.\" He added, \"It's not happening yet people,\" half-joking that the show wasn't being censored, \"yet.\" OK. Just a broadcast glitch. It's not happening yet people. See you tomorrow good people! â€” Trevor Noah (@Trevornoah) February 1, 2017 \nYou can watch the full interview here . <!--iframe--> Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jWHYjs NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
