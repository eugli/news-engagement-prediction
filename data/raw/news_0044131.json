'Chyna has disappeared for days at a time without communicating or providing any updates. This won't end well.' All smiles: The 29-year-old and the model, 28, split up the first time in early December but reunited before Christmas and were seen smiling as they flew into New York in mid January Another source claimed that the two had been not getting along since their first split in early December. '[It's the same] with her yelling and screaming about how his family doesnâ€™t like or support her, and his insecurities,' the source said. At the time Rob famously released a heartbreaking video clip on Snapchat showing his empty home and Dream's bare nursery. She's a Chanel baby: A week ago, Rob posted this snap of Dream in her designer duds, captioned, 'Today my baby girls is 3 months old and I'm in love with her' They got back together just a few days before Christmas leading some to speculate that the split was a promo stunt for Keeping Up With The Kardashians and their own reality show, Rob & Chyna. However, the two have been living separately as Chyna moved back into her home and Rob lives in the Calabasas estate his mother, Kris Jenner, bought for him last February. The couple enjoyed a whirlwind romance. Rob began dating the 28-year-old model in January 2016, and they got engaged on April 5. They announced they were expecting a baby a month later and Dream was born on November 10. Proud poppa: Rob's mother, Kris Jenner, posted this snap of her son and her newborn grand-daughter in November, captioned, 'This face says it all and melts my heart' ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:33:12.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
