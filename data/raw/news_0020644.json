Blankfein, one of the first investors. Mezvinsky was long gone from his job at Goldman in October 2013 when his mother-in-law Hillary was paid to give a speech to executives at the company during a technology conference in Arizona. She was reportedly paid $225,000 for that appearance. There had been news of trouble with the company's Greek bet for some time now, which was called the Eaglevale Hellenic Opportunity. Family time: Chelsea and Marc with daughter Charlotte and son Aidan (above) outside their Manhattan apartment last September Nanny diaries: Marc takes his daughter Charlotte to her first day of nursery school with one of the couple's nannies last September (above) The Wall Street Journal reported in February 2015 that Eaglevalle said in a letter to investors that year that they had been 'incorrect' to bet on Greece and that is why the company had lost money two of the three years prior. The main fund dropped 3.6% in 2014, fained just 2.06% in 2013 and lost 1.96% in 2012. The situation in the country last year likely only made things worse, with Greece having to be saved from the brink of economic collapse at the last second thanks to a bailout. But good news for the people working at the hedge fund, as most funds collect management fees meaning money comes in even if funds lose money. Shortly after starting Eagleville, Mezvinsky and Chelsea moved into a $10million New York City apartment opposite Madison Square Park. The four-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot apartment is one of only four residences in the building, which despite the low occupancy rate still has a full-time doorman. The apartment, whose hallways stretch a full city block, also has two dishwashers, two washer and dryers, dressing rooms with double-sided vanity mirrors, and two massive walk-in closets. The bedrooms meanwhile face right into Vera Wang's bridal design studio, who designed Cheslea's dress for her wedding day. Chelsea, 36, has stayed busy this past year campaigning for her mother while also working for the Clinton Foundation. She and her husband have a daughter Charlotte and a son Aidan.
