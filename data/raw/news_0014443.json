He said he plans on putting his son in the public board if Our Lady of Peace closes this summer. (James Morrison-Collalto)\nDematteis said parents' main concern is trying to keep the school's English and French Immersion community together.\nRight now, the proposal would move the school's English students to nearby Father John Kelly and the French Immersion students to Blessed Trinity, then close the school in June.\n\"There are other options they should be looking at.\" - Parent Joe Dematteis Dematteis said some families have children in both tracks. \"These are kids that have obviously been together for a long time,\" he added.\nParents are also concerned about the potential move of children in the English track to Father John Kelly, a school right on Keele Street, a busy \"arterial road,\" Dematteis said.\nMost former Our Lady of Peace students would \"have to cross the major street\" to get to their new school, noted another parent, Frank Bilotta, in an email to CBC Toronto.\nMore than 700 people have also signed an online petition pushing the board to consider other options.\nOur Lady of Peace school will likely close in June and its students sent to nearby Blessed Trinity and Father John Kelly. (York Catholic District School Board)\nSchool closure decisions 'challenging' Board chair Carol Cotton said the York Catholic District School Board of Trustees is \"very cognizant\" of parents' concerns.\nThe province \"has set clear expectations for school boards across Ontario to address surplus capacity due to declining enrolment to ensure effective use of Board resources,\" she said in a statement.\n\"Public Accommodation Reviews,\" such as the one happening right now in Maple, are \"difficult and emotion-laden processes,\" she added.\n\"School closure decisions are among the most challenging ones made by Trustees,\" Cotton said, adding no decision has been made yet regarding the review happening in Maple.\nCommunity consultations on the potential closure ended in late January. A last report will be made available online on Feb. 24, and a final decision about closing the school is scheduled for Feb. 28.\nBeforehand, Dematteis and other parents are planning another peaceful demonstration for Feb. 16.", "external_links": ["http://www.thepetitionsite.com/en-gb/787/871/832/save-our-lady-of-peace-school/"], "published": "2017-02-06T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:18:57.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
