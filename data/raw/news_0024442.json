Blumenthal a liar in angry morning tweets Trump attacks McCain, Blumenthal in early morning Twitter rant President Trump again took to Twitter to insult some politicians that have issues with him. (Borchuck, James/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday, February 9, 2017, 9:27 AM \nWASHINGTON — President Trump took aim at a pair of senators who have criticized him in recent days on Thursday morning, saying Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) \"emboldens the enemy\" by criticizing a recent military operation while accusing Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) of being a serial liar after he relayed critical comments from Trump's Supreme Court nominee. \nTrump's comments are the latest attacks on McCain, who he famously derided for being a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War early in the GOP primary with the line \"I like people who weren't captured.\" \n\"Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy! He's been losing so long he doesn't know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in — bogged down in conflict all over the place. Our hero,\" Trump said in a pair of tweets Thursday morning. John McCain has been very critical of the Trump White House. (MARK MAKELA/REUTERS) \nThe comments were the latest escalation in a feud between McCain and the White House. After McCain made critical comments about a raid in Yemen that reportedly failed to achieve its objectives and killed one American soldier and a number of civilians, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer demanded on Wednesday that everyone who had criticized the mission should apologize for doing a \"disservice\" to the fallen soldier. \nMcCain responded by with a statement that when he was a POW in North Vietnam, there was a failed attempt to rescue him and others — and that the troops who'd risked their lives to save him were \"heroes\" even though \"the mission failed.\" Trump also took aim at Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). (Andrew Harnik/AP) \n\"Mr. Spicer should know that story,\" he said. \nTrump wasn't done criticizing senators Thursday morning, using another Vietnam flashback to ridicule a senator who relayed private comments from by Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court that Trump's recent attacks on judges were \"disheartening\" and \"demoralizing.\" Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave \"service\" in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 \n\"Sen.Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?\" he tweeted, referencing Blumenthal's old false claims that'd fought in Vietnam. Neither Trump nor Blumenthal fought in the war after receiving multiple deferments, though Blumenthal did serve in the Marine Corps Reserve. \nAbout 90 minutes later, he returned to the topic, seemingly triggered by his habit of hate-watching CNN.

Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave \"service\" in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS!\" he said. \nWhat isn't fake: Gorsuch's own spokesman, who is working to help get Trump's nominees approved by the Senate, confirmed to the Daily News that he'd made the comments on Wednesday. \nAnd former Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who is acting as Gorsuch's sherpa in the Senate, put out a statement reconfirming the conversation on Thursday morning. \n\"Judge Gorsuch has made it very clear in all of his discussions with senators, including Senator Blumenthal, that he could not comment on any specific cases and that judicial ethics prevent him from commenting on political matters,\" Ayotte said in the statement. \"He has also emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary, and while he made clear that he was not referring to any specific case, he said that he finds any criticism of a judge's integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing.\" Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T16:54:52.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
