Indoor pollution claims roughly the same number again. \nMost of these deaths happen in cities, where automobile exhaust, factories and power plants, and coal and wood fires for heating and cooking are among the deadliest culprits. \nOver the course of this day, Guardian foreign correspondents will report live from the worst-off cities, from Delhi to Beijing to Lagos. We’re also be joined by experts who can answer your questions. And we’ll give tips on how to minimise your risk, rate the best anti-smog devices and learn how some cities are innovating to fight back. \nWe’d love to hear from you, too. \nHow does air pollution impact your daily life? Share your stories and experiences in the comments below or using the form here , and tag your pictures on social media with #guardiancities. \nAre you helping to improve air quality in your city? From grassroots campaigns to cycling to work, share your stories and pictures with us and we’ll feature the best in the live blog. Tweet us @guardiancities or tag pics on Instagram with #guardiancities. \nDo you have questions about air pollution? Just write them in the comments below or tweet them to @guardiancities . Frank Kelly, Professor of Environmental Health at King’s College London, and Dr Claire Holman, Chair of the the Institute of Air Quality Management, will be joining us from 1pm-3pm GMT to answer some of your queries. \nStay with us.
