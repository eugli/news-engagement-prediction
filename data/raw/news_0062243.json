Joe, is especially timely given widespread concerns about the rights of transgender youth in the United States. On Wednesday, President Trump rolled back protections for transgender students to use public-school bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity. \n“A Kid Like Jake” will be adapted by Silas Howard (known for the TV series “Transparent”), one of only a few transgender directors in Hollywood.

Double Nickel is the executive producer. \nThe project represents the first leading role in a movie for Parsons, the face of CBS’s “The Big Bang Theory,” who can be seen in a supporting part in “Hidden Figures.” Danes is currently starring in the sixth season of Showtime’s “Homeland.” \nIn the last four years, Hollywood has undergone a dramatic shift, producing more stories that center on transgender characters . In 2016, Focus Features’ “The Danish Girl,” starring Eddie Redmayne, received multiple Oscars nominations. Netflix’s “Orange is the New Black” launched Laverne Cox’s career in 2013, and in 2015, E! debuted “I Am Cait,” the short-lived docuseries starring Caitlyn Jenner. \n“A Kid Like Jake” will be shopped around to financiers in the coming days. CAA is handling the sale. Filed Under:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:42:59.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
