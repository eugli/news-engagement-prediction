A. Sanga, in his judgement said that due process was not followed in the decision by the PDP convention to dissolve the Ali Modu Sheriff-led chairmanship and hence should be disregarded. \nMeanwhile, the Chairman has described the court’s judgement as a victory for all , stating that the interest of the party supersedes his office as the National Chairman and is willing to relinquish the position for the party to move forward.
