He delves into his relationships with Bobby Cox and his famous Braves brothers — Maddux, Glavine, Smoltz, among them—and opponents from Cal Ripken Jr. to Barry Bonds. The National League MVP also opens up about his overnight rise to superstardom and the personal pitfalls that came with fame; his spirited rivalry with the New York Mets; his reflections on baseball in the modern era—outrageous money, steroids, and all — and his special last season in 2012.\nThe book will be released April 4, and includes a forward by Braves Hall of Fame manager Bobby Cox.\nAttendees at the Lawrenceville event (2500 Buford Dr N.E.) are asked to purchase the book from Eagle Eye Book Shop . Books will be for sale at the event while supplies last.\nChipper will not sign memorabilia at this event. Photos are allowed from the signing line only.\nThe book tour will also include an April 14 stop at a Cobb County bookstore .\nKicking off book tour w/ @RealCJ10 Twas a lot like working on the book: fun!! #Ballplayer https://t.co/mBZmacWGRt pic.twitter.com/M38xbgD2Al\n— Carroll R.
