The singer whose Billboard cover was shot on an iPhone 7 Plus using the new Portrait mode, said attempts at breaking the ice with the girls were 'intense' and left her feeling 'sad.' 'I don't want to get into the details of that,' Camila told the magazine after asked if she had attempted to contact the girls herself. 'Because it was really intense and it's hard for me to talk about. It makes me sad.'

'We were truly hurt. We've been together for almost five years, been through ups and downs,' a statement from the girls said. 'While this isn't the way any one of us would have wanted this chapter in our lives to have ended, we had to begin to formulate a plan and constructive path for Fifth Harmony to move forward, beyond Camila.'

Stardom bound: Cabello rocked a beautiful star print dress 'It's definitely not the safe option': Camila, pictured at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, views the risky decision to leave the group as a chance to grow Not exactly on speaking terms: The ladies of Fifth Harmony appeared without Cabello in February in West Hollywood 'The easiest route would be to shut my mouth, sing the songs, wear the clothes and keep going, you know?' she told Billboard. 'I mean, [we were] at the peak of our career. It's definitely not the safe option. 'I have it in my DNA. The way my mom raised me, it has always been: Don't settle. Jump and hope you grow wings on the way down.' Break from the group: Camila with former Fifth Harmony band mates, Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei, Dinah-Jane, and Lauren Jauregui in Las Vegas in May 2016 'The peak of our career': Camilla performed alongside her former band mates at the Billboard Music Awards in 2016 She said she believed her desire to 'honor that inner voice' - which she said she encouraged her band members to do as well - may have led to the downfall. 'I think that in a group there is always going to be tension, whether it's because of this thing or [another] thing. Obviously, I think that rocked the boat,' she said. Camila previously explained leaving the band was a chance for her to stay true to her artistic vision. 'Fifth Harmony wasn't the maximum expression of me individually,' she recently told Seventeen . 'My fans are really going to know me from the music I'm writing. My goal is to be brave and open up my soul.' Camila's upcoming solo album is due out in fall, according to Billboard.
