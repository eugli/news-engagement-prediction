Jeff Sessions for attorney general It has stoked fears among civil rights activists Washington (CNN) The future of criminal justice reform hangs in the balance as a vote on the nomination of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, President Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, was delayed by the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday. Activists worry that Trump, who preached \"law and order\" during his campaign and threatened last week to \"send in the Feds\" to violence-plagued Chicago, would halt former President Barack Obama's reforms, and institute new policies that could worsen conditions. Barack Obama's evolution in 10 years of hip-hop lyrics \"The Republican Party right now is divided between people who recognize now that the criminal justice system is a big failed, unaccountable government bureaucracy that's wasting money and lives on the one hand,\" CNN political commentator Van Jones told CNN. \"On the other hard, you have people who want to stick with the same old dumb on crime, lock 'em up policies that have made things worse, not better. Where Trump comes down is not clear yet.\" Trump is expected to move ahead with an executive action this week addressing local crime-fighting and curbing the sale of drugs in the United States. Read More Here's why activists and civil rights groups fear Trump's White House could turn a deaf ear to racial biases in law enforcement and policing: Sessions' record on sentencing reform disputed Trump's nomination of Sessions to be the next attorney general has exacerbated concerns that policing and sentencing reforms initiated by Obama would come to an end. As President, Obama granted 1,715 commutations for non-violent drug offenders -- more than the past 12 presidents combined. Of those, 568 of the individuals who received lesser sentences had been sentenced to death. Sessions slammed Obama's efforts as a \"weakening of some of our most important criminal sentencing policies.\" As a candidate, Trump accused the Obama White House of giving \"drug dealers and gang members\" a \"slap on the wrist\" and turning them \"loose on the street.\" The American Civil Liberties Union, a strong advocate for criminal justice reform, wrote a letter last week urging leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold a second hearing and cancel the pending committee vote on the senator's nomination, which has been delayed by Democrats who have asked for more time to review it. Obama to focus on future as Sessions confronts the past During his confirmation hearing earlier this month Sessions was met by strong opposition from Senate Democrats, most notably New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who became the first sitting senator to testify against a fellow sitting senator at a confirmation hearing for a Cabinet position. Booker slammed Sessions during the hearing, specifically citing his concern with his colleague's voting record on \"the crisis of mass incarceration.\" \"His record indicates that at a time when even the FBI director is speaking out about implicit racial bias in policing and the need to address it; at a time when the last two attorneys general have taken steps to fix our broken criminal justice system ... Sen. Sessions would not continue to lead urgently needed change,\" Booker said. \"America needs an Attorney General who is resolute and determined to bend the arc. Senator Sessions' record does not speak to that desire, intention, or will,\" he added. But former deputy attorney general Larry Thompson defended Sessions at the hearing and applauded his bipartisan work with Sen. Dick Durbin in passing the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act , which reduced the sentencing disparity between offenses for crack and powder cocaine from 100:1 to 18:1. \"Sen. Sessions would vigorously, but impartially enforce our laws,\" Thompson said. \"Of all our important civil rights, the rights to be safe and secure in one's home and neighborhood is perhaps the most important,\" he added. The ACLU said that while the Fair Sentencing Act was a \"a step toward fairness,\" the law \"still reflects outdated and discredited assumptions about crack cocaine.\" Sessions defended his record on criminal justice reform while being questioned by Durbin during the hearing and referenced a similar 2001 bill he co-sponsored, which was then criticized by the Bush administration. \"I stepped out against my own Republican administration and said openly on the floor of the Senate that I believed these crack cocaine laws were too harsh,\" Sessions said, \"and it was disadvantageous to the African-American community where most of the punishments were falling.\" Sessions dogged by old allegations of racism Sessions' nomination has also been dogged by old allegations of racism, which stem from racially charged comments he allegedly made as a US attorney in Alabama, which led him to be denied a federal judgeship 30 years ago. While the ACLU says they do not take a position supporting or opposing judicial nominations, the group has contested Sessions' position on civil rights issues. During Sessions' confirmation hearing the ACLU's legal director David Cole urged lawmakers to consider the Senator's record on civil rights â€” namely his opposition to the 1964 Voting Rights Act. Sessions defended himself against accusations of racism at the hearing and said he was unfairly portrayed as a racist in the past. \"I didn't prepare myself well in 1986 and there was an organized effort to caricature me as something that wasn't true,\" he said. \"I hope my tenure in this body has shown you that the caricature that was created of me was not accurate,\" he added.
