We’ve excerpted some past Strategist hits that would be an even better idea today. Use code BIGTHANKS at checkout for the discount.\nThe Best Everyday Bath Towels From an Amazon reviewer: “I bought some of these for Christmas last year. I looked at ‘good’ towels and almost swallowed my tongue at the price. I’m a guy … I’ll use an old shirt to dry off after a shower … or even drip-dry if necessary. So, I ordered these with mediocre expectations. So far, though, the wife and I have been pleased with them … If you want a decent, durable white towel to dry off with after the shower — hit ‘add to cart.’”\nBuy Martex Commercial Bath Towels $51 for six (with code BIGTHANKS) , Amazon The Best Pogo Stick “For extreme pogo stickers only. This can launch you 10 feet in the air and holds the world record for highest jump on a pogo stick. The newest version, V4, came out last February.”\nBuy Vurtego V4 Pro Pogo Stick $430 (with code BIGTHANKS) , Amazon The Best Clothing Organizer “The Yamazaki home Tower Leaning Ladder Rack leans on the wall next to my dresser and it holds shirts I wear a lot, the three black dresses I wear again and again to work (the tower is helpful for “uniform dressing”), and, well, bras. Everything gets its own rung. Stuff is off the ground, off the chair, and I can see it all.”\nBuy Yamazaki Home Tower Leaning Ladder Rack $51 (with code BIGTHANKS) , Amazon Adidas Sneakers That Aren't Stan Smiths “They’re not expensive (clocking in at $80), so that even when you have to bid farewell to an obsolete pair, you can do so knowing you’re not out, say, $500 for a designer pair. They quite honestly go with everything , especially if you choose a gray or black or navy.”\nBuy Adidas Gazelles From $62 (with code BIGTHANKS) , Amazon The Coziest Women's Pajamas “New life together, new pair of supersoft Eberjey pajamas.”\nBuy Eberjey Women’s Gisele Two-Piece Pajama Set $106 (with code BIGTHANKS) , Amazon A Very Warm Sleeping Bag “The Kelty Cosmic 20 Degree is considered by the pros to be one of the best super-warm-but-not-super-expensive down sleeping bags out there. (As Backpacker put it: “Want to fly business class on a coach fare?”) It’s made with DriDown, which means each down plume is “hydrophobic finished,” and if it gets wet, it can dry very quickly. It also has a cozy thermal hood. Perfect for the sibling just getting into camping, or for your kid heading off to sleepaway camp in Vermont for the first time.”\nBuy Kelty Cosmic 20 Degree Sleeping Bag $160 (with code BIGTHANKS) , Amazon The Best Automatic Pet Feeder “If your man is frequently out of town but needs to feed the dog, get him an automatic food dispenser that lets him schedule and portion out the exact amount via his phone.

Yay! (2) It doesn’t change the temperature of the room even though it’s a cool-mist humidifier. (3) I use one of those gadgets to see if it’s humid enough in the room, and this machine definitely works. (4) The filter doesn’t need replacing THAT often (maybe every six-seven months). (5) The tank can sit in the sink to be filled and doesn’t topple over. (6) It’s super-easy to set up and use.”\nBuy Honeywell HCM350W Germ Free Cool Mist Humidifier $46 (with code BIGTHANKS) , Amazon The Best Casserole Dish for a Mom Who Loves to Cook “A Le Creuset casserole that comes in a rainbow of colors, and is perfect for feeding you her famous baked ziti when you’re zonked out on her couch, watching Gilligan’s Island reruns on TV Land.”\nBuy Le Creuset Heritage Stoneware 12-by-9-Inch Rectangular Dish $66 (with code BIGTHANKS) , Amazon The Best Shower Radio “I am completely obsessed with my Sangean shower radio. It’s not especially cute, and it’s certainly not glamorous, but hand to God, it has changed my life — at least the part of my life that I spend in the shower, which is a not-insignificant chunk of time. The sound is good, it’s impervious to steam, and with ten presets, you can switch back and forth between NPR and Hot 97 with minimal frustration.”\nBuy Sangean Waterproof Shower Radio $56 (with code BIGTHANKS) , Amazon The Best Low-Maintenance Aquarium “This aquarium requires zero maintenance — just watch the little prawns feed on the seaweed that’s already encased inside.”\nBuy EcoSphere Closed Aquatic Ecosystem, Sphere $52 (with code BIGTHANKS) , Amazon The Best Stylish Headphones “Danish electronics brand Bang & Olufsen makes audio products that are works of art — for stylishly blocking out loud coworkers.”\nBuy B&O PLAY by Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H6 Over-Ear Headphones $278 (with code BIGTHANKS) , Amazon The Strategist is a new site designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
