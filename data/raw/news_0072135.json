Brighton Marine and the developer had wanted to demolish the 77-year-old buildings, but, under pressure from Massachusetts historic preservation officials, agreed to try to sell them for removal. If not sold 120 days from the day of the listing , the buildings will be demolished.\nThe agreement , reached last summer, allows the health center and developer WinnCompanies to move forward on a 102-unit apartment building, most of which will be priced as affordable housing. ans will be given preference for the apartments.\nThe Architectural Team\nThe two duplexes are to be sold within 120 days, or they will be demolished to make way for the construction of a new, 102-unit apartment building (seen above, in a rendering).\nThere are four older buildings at the location; originally, the plan was to demolish all but one. But then the Massachusetts Historical Commission and its overseer, lifelong Brighton resident and Secretary of State William F. Galvin, sought to protect the former residences.\nAdvertisement\nThe health center and Winn agreed to keep a second building and move it to another spot on the campus, and to see if they could sell the other two for $1 each, said Christopher Fleming, senior project director at WinnCompanies.\n“We’re giving away two buildings for a buck. We’re anxious to get going; there is such a demand,” Fleming said. “Hopefully we’ll find someone interested in preserving history and has a plot of land and they’d like to utilize it.”\nGalvin said he would prefer that the buildings remain in the neighborhood, and has talked up their sale to local nonprofit and community development groups. Interest, however, is hard to gauge.\n“The buildings are structurally in very good condition; they’re attractive looking, despite what some people think,” Galvin said. “We’re hopeful one of the community groups or other entities will come forward to take the buildings. If they could be of another use to the community, it would be ideal.”\nWinn has agreed to provide $34,000 for the relocation of each building — about what the company had estimated it would cost to demolish them, Fleming said. The properties are featured on a website aimed at history buffs and potential buyers at www.ownbrightonhistory.com .\nWhether relocated or demolished, Brighton Marine Center is eager to get them off the site, said spokeswoman Karen Schwartzman.\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

We’re anxious to get going; there is such a demand.’\nThe project, which is counting on public funding, could break ground later this year, Fleming said, adding that the delay over the quarters has likely pushed the project beyond the $41 million estimate.\nGLOBE FILE PHOTO\nThe duplexes are former officers’ and doctors’ quarters on the grounds of the Brighton Marine Health Center.\nKatheleen Conti can be reached at kconti@globe.com .
