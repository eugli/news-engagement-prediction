So it should come as no surprise that the classic hero shot at the end of the film’s new Super Bowl trailer would end with a little twist. Pom Klementieff ’s Mantis—the latest addition to the team—gets taken out unceremoniously by a fire ball. The trailer also revealed the film’s main villain—a gold-drenched figure played by Elizabeth Debicki . The character goes by Ayesha in the film but comics fans might be more familiar with more ominous names like “Paragon” or simply “Her.” Debicki makes a memorable entrance into the franchise with the phrase, “Just who the hell do you think you are?” Though Debicki’s character is the obvious villain of the film, there’s a chance that Kurt Russell ’s character, Ego, also has less than pure intentions. What else would you expect from Star Lord’s dad? But once a villain is not always a villain. After all, Yondu ( Michael Rooker ) spent the first film threatening Star Lord’s life—but is now comfortably ensconced as part of the rag tag hero team.
