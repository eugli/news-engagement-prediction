It is a very dark subject. \n\"My own children are teenagers but others with very young children have asked ‘should we be going into this darker territory?’. We have had many discussions on how to tell the story.” Bethany Platt (Photo: ITV) Lucy Fallon plays Bethany Platt (Photo: ITV) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Nathan Curtis lures schoolgirl Bethany Platt into his car Share this video Watch Next \nMeanwhile, Chris has said he is hoping his sinister storyline will help more terrified victims of paedophiles to come forward. \nThe 39-year-old actor prepared for the role by meeting abuse survivors through the NSPCC. And the shattering impact their ­stories had on him has only increased his ­determination to play the pervert to perfection.

It’s the most important storyline I’ve ever had,” Chris told The Sunday People. \n“It’s massively important I get this right for them. We want to reach out to people to let them know help is out there, and to tell ­abusers they can’t get away with it. (Photo: ITV) \n“Half the problem is getting people to come forward. It’s been said that for every one ­person reporting abuse, another seven don’t.” \nSince his Street debut at Christmas, when he peeled unconscious 16-year-old Bethany (Lucy Fallon) from the cobbles after she’d downed diet pills, predator Nathan has slowly wormed his way into her affections. \nAnd what has chilled viewers is that, unlike the Jimmy Savile or Gary Glitter dirty old man image, Nathan is young, good-looking and, on the surface, very well intentioned. \n“The stereotype is of this older man with a sticky suit, bad hair and bad teeth,” Chris says. “But often the reality is very different. The perpetrators could be any age, any colour or class, and so can the people affected.
