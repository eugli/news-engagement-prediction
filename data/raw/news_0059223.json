Merchants kicked in money on a sliding scale based on how much they stood to benefit from the festival; bars and restaurants paid more than a furniture store, for example, he said.\n\nWhile some merchants say they were in favour of the festival as it was, others said it actually hurt their businesses, and would like to see a different model.\n\nThe borough pulled its $5,000 worth of funding because the city can’t provide borough funding to a for-profit organization like Monkland Village Productions. The money would have been 3 per cent of the festival’s operating budget and did not make or break the event, said Roseman.\n\nMonkland Village Productions is also hired for other festivals and events, and Roseman said they would instead focus on those.\nThe new NDG Business Association will consider alternatives to the street festival on Monkland going forward\nThe association plans to meet and discuss ways to hold some kind of festival that will suit the merchants.\n \nRelated Stories Monkland street festival being scaled back", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:56:13.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
