Right now, the line between her work life and personal life seems to be blurred, as she is spending a lot of time with husband Vikrant Singh Rajpoot, albeit on the sets of her movies. She has just completed a film with him-Jai Shree Ram, and is currently in dilemma over her Valentine's Day plans. \nThe professional in her is pushing her to go for a Valentine's Day event in Mumbai with Vikrant, but the wife in her is craving for a holiday. And she doesn't know yet, which side of her will win. \nShe told us: \"I have an offer to go for this Valentine's Day special event with Vikrant. I haven't finalized it. Actually, I wanted to go on a holiday with Vikrant, and we had already chalked out plans. But now, I am not sure. I'm actually confused whether I should go for a holiday or go for this event.\" Manu called me, but we couldn't meet \nMona Lisa recently appeared on Bigg Boss 10, and she survived way longer than she expected. And it was all thanks to the M3 group she was part of (Manu, Manveer and Mona). Is she is touch with her friends from the house. \n\"Manu had called on Vikrant's phone and said that he was coming to Mumbai. However, we couldn't catch up when he was in Mumbai. I am not in touch with anybody else barring Navin Prakash, who calls me at times. \nManveer had shared that he had ran away from his wedding \n\"I didn't know that Manveer was married while being on the show. He had just said that he had ran away from his wedding. Yes, there is a clip on internet where he's telling Bani about his marriage, and I am also there in the background. But I never took interest in what other people were talking in the house. So I guess, I missed that part. I don't think he did anything wrong by hiding his marriage. It might be a painful experience and something he didn't want to share. I will surely ask him about it when we meet next.\" \nManveer and Nitibha were just good friends\"Manveer was possessive about his friends. He and Nitibha were good friends are nothing else. He used to give her special attention as after Manu, Nitibha was the last commoner.\" \nIn the meanwhile, Mona has a couple of exciting offers in her kitty that she cannot divulge right now. We will be waiting for your next venture, Mona!
