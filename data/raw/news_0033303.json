Getty Images \nDubbed the 'hot felon' when his police mugshot went viral in 2014, Jeremy Meeks made his New York Fashion Week debut last night as he walked the runway for Philipp Plein . \nHaving been arrested for possession of firearms and criminal street gang activity, the 33-year-old signed a modelling contract shortly before being released from prison in March last year and is now represented by London model management agency SUPA. \nPutting his well-recognised piercing blue eyes and chiseled jawline on show last night, the married father of three showcased Plein's latest collection at the New York Public Library in front of a star-studded crowd. \nSitting alongside fashion press and photographers were Madonna , Kylie Jenner and Tyga, as well as Paris Hilton and sister Nicky. \nWalking the runway alongside Meeks was Sofia Richie, Lineisy Montero and Dilone. \nKeep up to date with all the New York Fashion Week news and show reports here More about: ", "external_links": [],
