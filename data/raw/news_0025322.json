When you start charging fees, it’s a public taxi, and we can regulate public taxis,” he told reporters after attending a Chinese New Year open house at SMJK Chong Hwa. \nHe was responding to Dego Ride founder and chief executive officer Nabil Feisal Bamadhaj’s recent claim that the company does not need a licence from the Transport Ministry to operate. \nNabil had said that his company would continue to operate as there are no laws preventing it from doing so. \nDego Ride was declared illegal by Deputy Transport Minister Datuk Abdul Aziz Kaprawi on Jan 24. \nOn Saturday, Road Transport Department director-general Datuk Nadzri Siron advised the public against using the service until it secures a permit from the Land Public Transport Commission. \nLiow said he has received many calls from non-governmental organisations concerned with the safety of Dego Ride’s service. \n“We’re worried it can lead to more accidents in the country. \n“The higher the number of vehicles we have on the road, the higher the probability of road accidents,” he said. \nThe Government has been taking steps to improve public transportation service to resolve traffic jams, he said. \nIf Dego Ride presented a proposal to the Transport Ministry to legalise its operation, the ministry would look into it, but as of now, it is an illegal service, said Liow. \nHe presented a cheque for RM200,000 to SMJK Chong Hwa and RM1mil to Chong Hwa Independent School during the event. \nThe open house was organised by Federal Territory MCA and Wangsa Maju MCA. \nAlso present were Federal Territory MCA chairman Datuk Yew Teong Look and chairman of the board of directors for Chong Hwa Independent High School Datuk Seri Lim Keng Cheng.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:22:55.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
