Maybe he wanted to stop all the speculation. I didn't ask them to do this. I knew what the chairman was thinking,\" Ranieri said at a press conference that took place soon after the statement was released. \n\"I understand football. You have to do your job and I have to do my job. When you win three matches you are 'God', when you lose three you are not. \n\"This is not a crisis. When you aren't winning you lose confidence, it is normal.\" \nAsked about a report that Ranieri had replaced chicken burgers with pasta in the Leicester players' training ground canteen as punishment for their poor form, the 65-year-old laughed off the story and insisted he retained the squad's support. \n\"Never have I seen a chicken burger, only deep fried chicken. It's fantastic. I don't like pasta,\" he said. \n\"The dressing room is fantastic. We try to do our best, but this season everything is wrong. \n\"The relationship is the same as last season. I speak the same English and they understand me.\" \nLeicester have won only once in their last nine league games, have yet to score a league goal in 2017 and have mustered just five league victories all season. \nIt is a remarkable fall from grace for the club that captivated fans around the world with their title heroics. \n\"For me it is important to try the right solution for my players, that's it,\" Ranieri added. \n\"This club, these players came from the bottom to win a title. They made all the steps and for this reason I am very confident. \n\"Never before in my career did I win a title. I can say thank you all my life to the players. \n\"These players are warriors. They have already lived this situation. They know the problem, they know the enemy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T09:43:08.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
