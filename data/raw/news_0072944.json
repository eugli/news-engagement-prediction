For evidence of that, see the reversed layering move Ryan Gosling pulled while out in Los Angeles yesterday. \nA white T-shirt, black jeans, and combat boots is standard modern-guy style, but where Gosling deviated from the norm is with his top layers. While most guys reach for a plaid shirt or flannel and add a leather jacket on top to complete the look, Gosling did the opposite. He treated his leather jacket like a cardigan and added a check shirt-jacket as the final layer. It’s a combo we’ve seen him wear before using different pieces, and we like it because it’s just distinctive enough to stand out (it’s all in the lapels), without begging for attention. After all, we know Gosling likes to keep a low profile when he's not doing the dashing three-piece-suit thing . \nNow, admittedly, you shouldn't try this move if you have a tendency to sweat. It’s probably best for guys who live in cold climates or have a high tolerance for insulation. The last thing a big, sweaty guy needs is two boxy, heavy jackets constricting his armpits and back. But if you’re built like Gosling (give or take a muscle or two) and keep things as supremely chill as he does, you can pull it off. It helps if you’ve broken the leather jacket in to the point where it feels like a second skin, and if neither jacket is lined too heavily. The last thing you need in the mix here is shearling.
