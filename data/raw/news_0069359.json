Hall’s reps then filed a $5 million defamation lawsuit in which O'Connor was described as a \"desperate, attention-seeker ... now known perhaps as much for her bizarre, unhinged internet rants as for her music.” \nSoon after, O’Connor ridiculed Hall and his lawsuit with another inflammatory post: \"I do not like drugs killing musicians. And I do not like Arsenio Hall. He can suck my dick. That is if he isn't too busy sucking someone else's dick,” she wrote. \nNow, some 300 days later, she's retracted her initial claims. \n“I apologize for my Facebook posts about Arsenio to the extent that anyone thought I was accusing him of acting as Prince's drug dealer and supplying him with illegal hard drugs, or insinuating that Arsenio had something to do with Prince's death,” she told TMZ . “I sincerely apologize because those statements would be false, and I retract them unequivocally.” \nO’Connor, who is best known for the hit \"Nothing Compares 2 U,\" a cover of a Prince composition released in 1990, has battled with mental health problems in recent years. All of her original Facebook posts regarding Hall have been deleted and Hall’s representatives have reportedly said their client will file to dismiss the lawsuit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:13:12.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
