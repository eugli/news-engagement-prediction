I sincerely apologize because those statements would be false, and I retract them unequivocally.\" \nArsenio isn't spiking the football in victory -- his reps say he'll file to dismiss the lawsuit, now that Sinead's admitting she was wrong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:23:05.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
