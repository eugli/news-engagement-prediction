More by Jan Hefler Arrow icon \nThe federal courtroom in Camden was standing-room only, as 100 people filed in Friday to show support for Charles Bangle, the owner of Manco & Manco, a landmark chain of pizza shops on the Ocean City, NJ Boardwalk. Two years ago, Bangle, 57, of Somers Point, had admitted to evading nearly $92,000 in taxes , and now he faced up to 24 months in prison, under the terms of a plea agreement. \nU.S. District Judge Robert B. Kugler said that he was impressed by the stories of Bangle’s kindness, generosity and charitable deeds, as told by two dozen of Bangle’s supporters, but said a 15-month term was warranted because of the seriousness of the crime. \nBangle's wife, Mary, received three years probation for lying to IRS agents. \nThose who urged Kugler to be lenient: a parade of clergy, firefighters, police officers, the head of the Ocean City Pops orchestra, teachers and former pizza shop employees. \nLes Cahn, who worked for the ADT security system firm, said he gave Charles Bangle his first job in business decades ago and is now amazed when he visits the shore and watches him at one of the pizza shops \"tossing hundreds of pies in the air. And I wonder if he is going to collapse from exhaustion...he has a hands-on style, in the trenches.\" \nStill, the judge said deterrence was needed. \n“It’s important for people to comply with tax laws and pay their fair share. Otherwise the rest of you have to make it up with your taxes,” Kugler said. He also said that taxes are needed to pay for schools, fire departments, police, roads, and even the courthouse in which he presides. “We would have no government, no society whatsoever if people didn’t pay their taxes.” \nKugler also said that he was “mystified as to why (Bangle) was spending millions of dollars building a new restaurant at this time in his life” and has not spent “a penny to pay off the debt to the people of the U.S.” after evading taxes. \nKugler said the court documents showed that Bangle had collected paper bags full of cash from the business and had hidden them under pizza boxes . The U.S. Attorney’s Office had charged Bangle with concealing close to $1 million in income from 2007 to 2011, and said that he and his wife, Mary, failed to pay more than $330,000 in taxes. \nCharles Bangle was also ordered to pay $248,560 in restitution. He had also admitted to making numerous cash deposits in 2011 under $10,000 to prevent his bank from reporting them to the U.S., which could have brought quicker scrutiny. \nHis attorney, Laurence S. Shtasel, of Philadelphia, requested the prison term start in September so that Bangle can complete plans to open the new pizza shop on the Ocean City boardwalk and bring in income during the summer. Kugel granted the request. \nWhen the sentence for her husband was announced, Mary Bangle, 55, gasped and then began sobbing. \nHer parents had operated the first of the three Manco & Manco pizza shops on the boardwalk decades ago. The judge said Mary Bangle had a good work history, no criminal record, and a reputation for being a good member of the community. \nCharles Bangle handled the daily business operations while Mary handled the cash and the payroll, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jason M. Richardson had recommended Charles Bangle receive between 12 and 18 months imprisonment, saying Bangle was a responsible, respected member of his community, but committed tax crimes “in secret” for several years while operating a cash business. Tax monies are used, he said, “to support the programs of the government and to help those in need.” \nIn remarks to the judge, Bangle said that he was “extremely apologetic over mistakes I made, and am humbled.” He said that he had realized years ago that mistakes in the business were made and in 2006 he was trying to find a way “to get out of a toxic situation we were in.” He provided few details but said that he and his wife acquired the company in 2011, but overpaid and took on a substantial “financial burden.” \nThat was one reason, he said, that he is building a new pizza shop on the boardwalk, to restructure his debt and stretch it out over 20 years. “I had to grow organically to stay in business,” he said. \nMary called him “her hero” and said he has shown many acts of kindness to employees in need and has supported various civic organizations in Ocean City and the area. When it came time for her sentencing, she told the court she was too distraught after her husband's sentencing to speak on her own behalf. \nAfter the four-hour hearing, Charles Bangle declined to comment whether he would appeal the sentence.
