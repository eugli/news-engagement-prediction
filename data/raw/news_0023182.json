But then came another comment... apparently from his girlfriend. \n\"Umm excuse me @jordan_vonsmith86??? I don't recall going last night or ever liking Burger King who are you talking about?\" she wrote. \nShe quickly followed up her question with \"answer your f***ing phone\". \nUh oh. \nJordan quickly told her she needed to \"chill out\", claiming \"I was with @kitcass01 and we were just catching up.\" \nBut this made @kitcass01 unhappy with him, too. \"please don't bring me into this\", she commented. \nIf she thought that would excuse her from the whole messy situation, it didn't, as Jordan's girlfriend took it upon herself to reply: \"F*** you, you brought yourself into this you fat b****.\" \nShanlee then tagged some friends in the comments, who jumped in and backed her up, saying they had seen him with girls in the past. (Photo: https://www.instagram.com/shanlee_rose//Instagram) \nInstagram users are now flocking to Burger King's Instagram account to see how the argument turned out, but they appear to have been deleted - much to their disappointment. \naminebattas wrote: \"Where are the comments of the couple fighting lol i wanna know what happened later\" \nvicarondo was totally honest, commenting: \"Whose (sic) only here because they've read about the couple breaking up on here somewhere.\" \nOf course, some people are cynical and think the two accounts have been created by Burger King to generate publicity. \nggomez_89 commented: \"Burger king making up bullshit stories for publicity. The couples accounts are faker than the meat in your burgers.\" \nIf that's the case, then it certainly worked.
