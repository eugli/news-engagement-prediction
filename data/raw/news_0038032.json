The amendment has introduced two new points -- firstly, no government official will consume intoxicating drinks or drugs, and secondly, he or she will strictly adhere to it wherever they are,\" said Mehrotra. \nThe same has been extended for officials of Judicial services as well, Mehrotra said. \nThe rule would be amended in accordance with the spirit of new Liquor Law, 2016. \n\"If anyone is found breaching the new rules, departmental proceedings can be initiated against them and punishment, as decided by the appointing authority, can range from fine and suspension to demotion and service termination,\" the official said. \nBihar liquor ban: Thousands form human chain to support Nitish Kumar's prohibition policy \nWhen asked about the how the government will find out about officials boozing outside Bihar, the official added, \"Random medical tests, photographs on social media or even sting operationsâ€¦ if we get to know from anywhere, the erring official will be taken to task.\" \nThe total prohibition in force in Bihar stops trade and consumption of alcohol across the state and has made provision of stringent penal action as well jail term ranging from 5-10 years for the violators. \nChief Minister Nitish Kumar imposed the liquor ban in the state on April 5, 2016. \nHundreds of thousands of people across Bihar formed a human chain in January to support the state government's prohibition policy, with CM Nitish Kumar claiming participation of more than three crore people in the record endeavour. \n(With Agency inputs)   12:00 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T10:18:04.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
