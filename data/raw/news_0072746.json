I want to make him three-dimensional again.'\nIn the second episode Taberski goes to Simmons' home to see if he can find him but there is no sign of him.\nThe description of the podcast says: 'In February 15, 2014, fitness guru Richard Simmons disappeared.\n'He stopped teaching his regular exercise class at Slimmons, cut off his closest friends, and removed himself from the public eye after decades as one of the most accessible celebrities in the world. Nobody has heard from him — and no one knows why he left.\n'Filmmaker Dan Taberski was a Slimmons regular and a friend of Richard’s. Missing Richard Simmons is Dan’s search for Richard — and the deeper he digs, the stranger it gets.'\nTaberski plans on releasing six podcasts exploring his disappearance.\nRumors have circulated wildly about the possible reason for his absence from the public eye, including that his housekeeper, pictured left, was holding him hostage\nRumors have circulated wildly about the possible reason for his reclusiveness. Some have speculated that he is transitioning into a woman, depressed over the death of his prized dalmatian, or marred by knee injuries, Chron reported.\nAfter elder abuse was reported by an anonymous friend of Simmons last year, Los Angeles Police visited his home and reportedly were satisfied with his condition - but friends remain unsure.\nHis housekeeper Reveles is the only person that's been seen emerging from Simmons house in recent years.\nHis former assistant Mauro Oliveira, left, told Daily Mail Online last year that Simmons' housekeeper was controlling him with black magic - and it was Richard himself who confided to his friend that he was under her thumb\nHis former assistant Mauro Oliveira, told Daily Mail Online last year that Simmons' housekeeper was controlling him with black magic - and it was Simmons himself who confided to his friend that he was under her thumb.\n'Yes, that's what he told me [about Teresa],' said Oliveira.\n'He told me last time we spoke. I asked him, does she control your life? He said 'Yes.'\nOliveira expressed concern that the way Simmons spoke during his last interview - where he assured reporters he was OK - didn't sound 'right'.\nHe thinks that Reveles believes she is Simmons' unofficial 'wife', and doesn't want any other people around to compete for his affection.", "external_links": ["http://www.chron.com/entertainment/celebrities/article/Where-is-Richard-Simmons-10955142.php", "http://app.stitcher.com/splayer/f/130412/49137432", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-25T15:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:59:02.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
