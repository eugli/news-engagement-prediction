Ryan, was “manipulated” by the Hillary Clinton campaign. According to Ryan, Manigault “stood right in my face like she was going to hit me,” Ryan said. “I said, ‘You better back up.’ . . . She thought I would be bullied. I won’t be.” \nPost reporter Abby Phillip, who was near the argument, said the law enforcement intervention was requested by Ryan, who felt Manigault’s “behavior was so threatening.” \nPer the Post: \nDuring their altercation, Ryan said Manigault told her that she was among several African American journalists who were the subject of White House “dossiers.” Manigault has previously said that Trump is keeping “a list” of opponents, though at the time she was referring to Republicans who voted against Trump. \nThe Post asked the White House for comment, but the administration did not respond. \nIf only there were some person — preferably in the Trump administration — who could have warned us that the White House was compiling an enemies list . Thankfully that someone is Omarosa, who said right after Donald Trump was elected: “It’s so great our enemies are making themselves clear so that when we get in to the White House, we know where we stand.” Jeremy Binckes is the cover editor at Salon.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T21:57:18.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
