It was a company I had heard good things about and I thought this job would suit me. 'The first question I was asked was whether I would rather watch my parents have sex for a year or join in just for the start. I was absolutely gob-smacked.' The applicant, who asked not to be named, was then asked if he would rather 's*** a brick or cry glass'. The teenager walked out and complained - and the American-style restaurant chain has now apologised. Pictured: Stock photo of the inside of a TGI Fridays restaurant He said: 'Before I'd had chance to respond I was asked whether I would rather eat chocolate flavoured s*** or s*** flavoured chocolate. 'He seemed to think I would find it funny and join in. 'I thought it was disgusting, sick and pathetic. I left the interview at that point.' THE OUTRAGEOUS QUESTIONS IN FULL 'Would you rather watch your parents have sex for a year or join in just for the start?' 'Would you rather s*** a brick or cry glass?' 'Would you rather eat chocolate flavoured s*** or s*** flavoured chocolate?' A spokesman for TGI Fridays said: 'Fridays offers an industry-leading recruitment process, and this incident fell severely below our high standards. 'The questions posed during the interview with the candidate are absolutely not part of TGI Fridays interview process and we were very disappointed to learn of this incident. Immediate action was taken, with the person involved suspended. 'We have apologised to the candidate for the experience and offered them the opportunity to re-interview with us, which we hope they will take up.' On its website, TGI Fridays says its employees work by a manifesto, adding: 'Simply put if we all live by the principals of our manifesto, not only are we true Fridays people, we are also pretty amazing human beings. The manifesto words were written from the heart of one of our team, who aspires to behave in this way every day at home and at work.'
