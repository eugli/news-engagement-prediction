I prepare my character’s graph in a linear pattern and when I saw the film, Vishal sir explained why he cut those scenes,” said Kangana. \n“Of course, it was a very legitimate thing to do. But when I got to know several top-notch scenes of my graph have been cut, all my hopes were shattered. I thought now my work will be so-so, it won’t be appreciated that much. But despite that people are loving it. I am very happy,” she added. \nThe film, which released today, also features Shahid Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan. \nThe Tanu Weds Manu star said expecting every film to do a certain-crore business is “vulgar”. “This is a business proposition, so all you want is that the investments should be recovered. The idea of business has become a little vulgar. With every film there is this expectation of doing Rs 100 crore. But it should be a beneficial business proposition for everyone.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:20:28.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
