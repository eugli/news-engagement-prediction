So the proof is in (the) 1267 Committee action. In this case what he has done, extent of his actions are well-documented.\" \n\"Also the proposal in question this time is not moved by us. It is not that the burden of proof is on India to convince. The sponsors seem to be very well convinced, otherwise they would not have taken the initiative to move the proposal,\" he said. \nAbout China saying that there is no consensus on the issue, the Foreign Secretary said, \"there is no consensus because China has not joined it\", as per PTI . \nSince the 1267 Committee proceedings are not public, he said, \"Our understanding is that there is overwhelming support in the 1267 (Committee). This (is) what we are told\". \n\"Other countries should be asked. The 1267 Committee is not for public. Our understanding (is that) there is overwhelming support in the 1267 (Committee). This (is) what we are told,\" Jaishankar said. \nThe FS made the comments after meeting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and attending an upgraded strategic dialogue with China's Executive Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui.

It was agreed that joint economic group that's headed by CI will meet early to review this,\" as per ANI . \nHe had arrived in China yesterday from Sri Lanka. \nYesterday, Jaishankar had held talks with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi during which they had expressed strong commitment to develop positive relations despite differences over Beijing's reluctance to support India's NSG bid as well as a UN ban on Azhar. \nYang is the state councillor and Beijing's special representative for border talks between India and China. \nIn Chinese official hierarchy, state councillor of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) is regarded as the top diplomat functioning directly under the country's leadership. \n(With Agency inputs)   18:44 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:07:06.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
