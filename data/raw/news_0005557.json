Catherine Urqhart reports. \nThe legal agreement says Wilke’s husband, Ronald Wilke, would pay his stepdaughter $33,000 and that Thomson would drop a civil lawsuit against him and agree not to discuss or disclose publicly any allegations of sexual assault. \nJosh Colley of Peel Regional Police in Ontario says officers with the special victims unit, which investigates sexual assault and incidents involving children, have begun an investigation stemming from a complaint made by Thomson, although he was unable to identify the subject of the investigation. \nThe Wilkes’ lawyer, John Whyte, declined comment on the allegations and says neither he nor his clients have been contacted by police and they are unaware of any investigation. \nNone of the allegations have been proven in court. \nIn the legal response to the Wilkes’ lawsuit filed earlier this month, Thomson alleges that she was the victim of sexual, physical and psychological abuse as a child at the hands of her stepfather. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:02:02.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
