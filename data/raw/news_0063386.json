If you’re running a business, this can be really inconvenient even if it’s just for a few days.”\nInstallations are expected to ramp up, with all Australians expected to be able to access the NBN within three years — by 2020.\nSo it’s time to get savvy, here’s what you need to know.\nYOU CAN’T SAY NO\nIf you want a home phone service — not just internet — you need the NBN.\nOnce your home or workplace is NBN-ready, you will have 18 months at most to subscribe to an NBN plan before your phone line and internet will be disconnected.\nHowever, in some areas (mainly apartment buildings in urban areas) third-party players such as TPG and others, will offer rival internet services so NBN does not have a total monopoly.\nFor those living in rural areas that are too remote to get fibre, an interim satellite will shut down on February 28, and they must switch to Sky Muster if they want to continue getting internet.\nYOU WILL HAVE MANY OPTIONS\nThose people knocking on your door will likely be salespeople from retailers like Optus, Telstra and iiNet offering plans for you to connect to the NBN.\nThis is because the NBN Co provides the service, but doesn’t actually sell broadband internet services to households.\nMore than 50 retail service providers are currently offering different plans at different prices so there’s plenty of choice.\nPicking which one to go with is probably one of the most difficult decisions you will have to make as choosing a cheaper plan may deliver slower speeds.\nMany people don’t realise their speeds are also limited by where their homes are, and how they connect to the NBN.\nDuring recent consultation, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found many consumers were confused about what speeds they could get, and weren’t getting what they thought they were signing up for.\nmedia_camera It’s a good idea to compare plans before you sign up to an NBN provider.\nNOT EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE SAME SPEEDS\nConnecting to the NBN using copper wires via the Fibre-To-The-Node technology will slow down their speeds and many are not aware how much of difference this makes.\nAt the moment the top speed offered by retailers is 100/40. This means you can download 100 megabits per second (Mbps) and upload 40 Mbps.\nBut if you are located more than 400m metres away from the “node”, which is essentially a cabinet where the copper meets the fibre optic cable, your maximum speeds will drop.\nThose up to 800m metres away will probably only be able to get a maximum of 50 Mbps, and those even further away are looking at 25 Mbps.\nYou will not be able to get higher speeds than this, no matter which company you sign up with.\nTechnically, retailers are not supposed to sell you a faster contract if you are too far away from a node to get higher speeds, but this has happened.\nYour home’s distance from the node is something you will have to check with the retailers as they don’t automatically tell you.\nEven if you think you are close to a node (because you can see a cabinet close by), it doesn’t mean this is the node that you are connected to.\nBE CAREFUL WHEN CHOOSING A CONTRACT\nEveryone’s internet speeds will impacted by the plan that you sign up to as each company decides how much bandwidth they want to buy on the NBN network.\nIf the company you sign with doesn’t buy that much bandwidth (to save money), speeds can be a lot slower during peak times when there’s more demand.\nSome people have complained of speeds dropping to 3 Mbps during peak times and top speeds promised may only be achieved at quiet times — like 3am.\nThe problem is, most companies don’t reveal what their real internet speeds are, saying only that you can get “up to” certain speeds.\nIf you want to get a better idea of who offers the best speeds, the Google Video Quality Report , shows the YouTube video performance over the 24-hour period for different providers, while Netflix’s ISP Speed Index can give you an idea of which retailers have the fastest speeds for their service.\nThe Australian Communications Consumer Action Network also has a fact sheet to help guide people through the process.\nFinder.com.au has a broadband comparison tool that shows providers in your area, and how much their plans are.\nSPEEDS MAY IMPROVE AFTER 18 MONTHS\nAn NBN spokesman said customers may get higher speeds 18 months after getting NBN because the network does not operate at full power initially to avoid interference issues with existing ADSL services.\n“When an area has fully switched over to NBN Fibre-To-The-Node services we will then turn the VDSL connection up to full power — this should increase potential lines speeds by between 5-10 Mbps,” he said.\ncharis.chang@news.com.au\n What you don’t realise about NBN", "external_links": ["https://ispspeedindex.netflix.com/", "https://www.finder.com.au/broadband-plans?utm_source=pr_pressrelease_internal&utm_campaign=0d75474253-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_12_08&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_5921dab448-0d75474253-295408989&goal=0_5921dab448-0d75474253-295408989", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/149e3b407f6c7dda90a995aaae304bda?width=650", "http://accan.org.au/files/Tip%20Sheets/Tips%20for%20picking%20a%20good%20value%20NBN%20internet%20plan%20brochure%20web%2002.pdf", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/nbn/the-big-lie-that-nbn-customers-are-being-sold/news-story/c5cd88a0a26a70a2183d635809de1519", "https://www.google.com/get/videoqualityreport/#", "https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=2600082&p=82#r1639", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/nbn/what-you-dont-realise-about-the-nbn/news-story/96895fcaf406e16a7a3c4d9ac45a4fd4"], "published": "2017-02-22T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:16:31.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
