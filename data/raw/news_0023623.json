PUBLISHED: 02:40, Thu, Feb 9, 2017 | UPDATED: 03:02, Thu, Feb 9, 2017 GETTY Trump posts screenshot of Morning Consult/Politico poll which declares his ban, popular \nIt comes after the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco refused to implement Trump’s controversial travel ban “pending a full consideration of the emergency motion”. \nThe Republican President posted a screenshot of the poll alongside the caption which read: “Immigration Ban Is One of Trump’s Most Popular Orders So Far.” Related articles Trump is 'wishing' for a terror attack on US to justify travel ban \nThe Morning Consult/Politico poll showed 55 per cent of voters approved of the immigration ban, which blocks travel from seven majority Muslim countries – with 35 per cent claiming they “strongly approve” of Trump’s proposal. \nThe only other order more popular than the travel ban is the one revoking federal funding for immigration sanctuary cities. Mexico Wall: Trump gives the go ahead Thu, January 26, 2017 The structures, fences and walls that mark the border between the United States and Mexico as President Donald Trump reiterates his promise to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. AFP/Getty Images 1 of 11 Combo with images of the border fence between Mexico and the U.S. taken in the states of Sonora and Baja California, Mexico, and in the states of Arizona and California, U.S., between July 2, 2016 and January 25, 2017. \nConducted from between February 2 and 4, the poll also shows his least popular orders, one of which hopes to end federal aid for global health groups if they provide abortion services. \nHis public approval of the poll comes days after Trump blasted CNN, ABC and NBC polls for making “fake news” and “negative polls” during the election. \nYesterday the US President ferociously attacked US judges for ruling against his travel ban. \nTrump told a conference of police chiefs that he “heard things he couldn’t believe” as he listened to Tuesday’s hearing. GETTY Trump applauded the poll and criticised the judges \nThe billionaire added: “I don’t want to call a court biased, so I won’t call it biased and we haven’t had a decision yet but the courts seems to be so political. \n“It would be so great if our justice system would be able to read a statement and to do what is right.” \nThe states of Washington and Minnesota, which opposed the travel ban, have until Monday to file their fresh objections.
