She died from a combination of septicemia and blunt chest trauma in September 2015. Kandyce Downer was made Shi-Anne's guardian in January 2015.

Credit: ITV News \nOn behalf of all the agencies that sit on the Safeguarding Board I would like to express our deepest sympathies to Shi-Anne’s birth family, the foster family who cared so well for her before she was placed with the Special Guardian, and all those who knew and loved her. \nThis tragic case has informed the improvement of services in Birmingham and will go on to contribute to the training and culture of learning that our Safeguarding Partnership is committed to. \nWhilst nothing can bring Shi-Anne back; she will not be forgotten. – Penny Thompson, Independent Chair of the Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board If you are concerned about a child, please call the Children’s Information Advice Support Service on 0121 303 1888 Last updated Wed 22 Feb 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:08:19.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
