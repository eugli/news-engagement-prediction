Fusion had first been in 2015 by a Republican donor to dig up dirt on Trump. But after the real estate baron won the GOP nomination, the Republican backer dropped from the project. Fusion reportedly found a Democratic ally of Hillary Clinton to finance the investigation, which Steele was hired onto last June.\nSteele compiled the dossier, which is actually a series of memos, based on information from Russian sources. The ex-spy is said to have relied on third-hand information because he is unable to travel to Russia due to his work in MI6.\nIt was reported by The Wall Street Journal last week that the source of the most salacious claims made in the dossier is a Belarusian-American named Sergei Millian, the executive director of a small trade group called the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce.\nAccording to The Journal, Millian told a source who ultimately reported to Steele that the Russian government had video recordings of Trump engaged in lewd sexual acts in a Moscow hotel room in 2013. The dossier asserted that the Kremlin was using the video to blackmail Trump. Millian is also said to be the source behind the claim that Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, met with a Russian government agent in Prague last year to discuss hacking Democrats’ emails.\nCohen has strongly denied ever visiting Prague or meeting with Russian agents. He was also reportedly in southern California at the time he was alleged to have been in Prague.\nThe involvement of Simpson and Millian in the development of the dossier would seem to cast further doubt on the veracity of the document.\nOne target of Simpson’s dirt digging called him a “professional smear campaigner” in an interview with The Daily Caller last month.\nBill Browder, an American-born businessman who was at one point the largest foreign investor in Russia, has said that Simpson worked with a former Russian intelligence agent named Rinat Akhmetshin to undercut the Magnitsky Act. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Oppo Researcher Behind Trump Dossier Is Involved In Pro-Kremlin Lobbying Effort) \nBrowder was the main proponent of the law, which sanctions Russian criminals and is strongly opposed by the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin.\nAs for Millian, Trump’s lawyer Cohen called him “a phony” in an interview with TheDC. Cohen has strongly denied ever visiting Prague. He also said that Millian has falsely claimed to have a business relationship with Trump. (RELATED: The Source Of The Salacious Claims In The Trump Dossier Has Been Identified) \nSmith, BuzzFeed’s editor, has defended his outlet’s publication of the dossier, saying that the public had a right to read the information contained in a document that had been circulating around newsrooms for months.\nOther outlets declined to publish the document because its claims were unverifiable. But BuzzFeed said it decided to publish after CNN reported earlier on Jan. 10 that U.S. intelligence officials had briefed Trump and then-President Obama on some of the information laid out in the dossier.\nIn one interview defending the publication of the dossier, Smith was asked by MSNBC’s Chuck Todd why BuzzFeed did not redact some of the names and identifying information in the document given that its claims were uncorroborated.
