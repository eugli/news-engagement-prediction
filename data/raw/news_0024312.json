On Wednesday, FirstBank announced it is buying two banks — Knoxville's Clayton Bank and Trust and Tullahoma's American City Bank — for $284.2 million. Both banks are subsidiaries of Clayton HC Inc., a holding company owned by Knoxville billionaire Jim Clayton. Jim Ayers Nathan Morgan | Nashville Business Journal This is FirstBank's first merger since the bank made its September debut on the New York Stock Exchange . The deal will be financed through 5.86 million shares of FirstBank stock (valued at $144.7 million as of Tuesday's market close), $60 million in subordinated debt and $79.5 million in cash, according to a news release. “We are very excited to announce the proposed acquisition of the Clayton Banks ,\" Chris Holmes , CEO of FirstBank, said in a statement. \"This strategic transaction will significantly expand our footprint in key metropolitan markets and enhance our community markets in Tennessee. We expect the addition of the Clayton Banks to be immediately accretive to our earnings per share in 2017.\" FirstBank hopes to close the deal in this year's third quarter. Combined, the two banks will add more than $1.2 billion in total assets, $1.1 billion in total loans and $920 in total deposits to FirstBank. \"Our strong presence in key markets along with a highly skilled niche business line is a tremendous asset for FirstBank, who is committed to continued investment throughout our footprint,\" Jim Clayton, chairman and CEO of Clayton HC, said in a statement. This deal ranks as the fourth-largest bank merger in the U.S. thus far in 2017 in terms of transaction value, according to SNL Financial. The pairing of FirstBank with Clayton HC is an interesting one, considering the similarities in the banks' histories. Until its initial public offering, FirstBank was owned entirely by Nashville billionaire Jim Ayers . Not a banker by trade, Ayers began his career in the nursing home industry and owned the West Tennessee-based American Health Centers before divesting from the company in the mid-1990s. He became a banker in 1984 when he and a partner purchased Scotts Hill, Tenn.-based Farmers State Bank. Ayers would ultimately buy his partner out in 1988, merging with the National Bank of Lexington and changing the combined bank's name to FirstBank in the process. Like Ayers, Clayton did not begin his career in banking. In 1956, he founded Clayton Homes, now the country's largest builder of manufactured housing and modular homes. He later sold the company to Warren Buffett in 2003. He entered the banking industry in 1993 when he formed BankFirst, a company he later took public before selling it to BB&T in 2000. He purchased First State Bank in 2002, following it up with the purchase of American City Bank in 2004. He launched Clayton Bank and Trust in 2005. The release does not say what will happen to Clayton HC's third subsidiary, First State Bank, following the merger. Olsen Palmer LLC served as Clayton Bancorp's financial advisor, while Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz served as the bank's legal adviser. Stephens Inc. served as FirstBank's financial adviser, while Alston & Bird LLP served as the Nashville bank's legal adviser. Meg Garner covers banking, government and law.
