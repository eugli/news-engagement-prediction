They say Muise is living a “stable and financially secure life” and doesn’t have to work.\nThey say his partner is financially secure, is comfortable with the fact that he does not have to work, and that Muise has said his job is to support her.\nHowever, the documents also acknowledge the “extreme irony” that Muise seems to be living a “good life” while his victims remain “forever irreparably damaged” by his crimes.\nThere has also been a change to one of his parole conditions. Muise had been ordered to avoid meeting people with a criminal background, but he has been contact with a man he met while in prison in Quebec.\nThe documents state the man, who is on parole and serving a life sentence, also lives in the lower mainland area of British Columbia and has “demonstrated stability in the community during his parole.”\nMuise asked his case management team if he could meet with the man, identified only as KB in the documents, and was granted permission on two occasions. However, his case management team then realized one of his conditions prohibited him from having any contact with a person who has a criminal record.\nOnce they realized the error, Muise was directed to have no contact with KB until the Parole Board of Canada could amend the wording of the condition. The documents state that Muise’s case management team believes he should avoid anyone who has an active criminal record, but that associating with a person who has a historical criminal record should be allowed, as long as that person is “involved in pro-social activities.”\nThe wording of the condition has been changed so that Muise must instead avoid associating with anyone he knows or has reason to believe is involved in criminal activity.\nDerek Wood and Freeman MacNeil remain behind bars for their involvement in the murders.\nWood was convicted of a number of charges, including two counts of first-degree murder, and sentenced to life in prison with no eligibility for parole for 25 years.\nMacNeil was convicted of first-degree murder and is also serving a life sentence with no eligibility for parole for 25 years.\nWith files from The Canadian Press \nDarren Muise's Parole Board of Canada documents are shown below:\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRelated Stories Man convicted in notorious McDonald's murders granted full parole McDonald's murderer Darren Muise granted day parole Cape Breton community reacts to release of McDonald's killer Photos Three people were murdered and one woman was left permanently disabled when three men robbed this McDonald's restaurant in Sydney River, N.S. in May 1992.
