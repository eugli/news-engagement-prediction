They said the exchanges weren’t profitable, after the law’s “individual mandate” requiring people to hold insurance failed to prod enough young and healthy customers into the market place. \nInstead, they faced a rash of sicker customers with costly medical claims, forcing them to hike their rates or exit the program. \nMr. Trump said the Humana decision proves that “Obamacare continues to fail.” \n“Humana to pull out in 2018. Will repeal, replace & save healthcare for ALL Americans,” Mr. Trump said. \nRepublicans who control all levers of government say they’re working on a plan to replace Obamacare’s heavy mandates with market reforms that will entice people into plans. \nThey haven’t fully sketched out a plan for scrapping the law and ensuring a smooth transition, however, leading some analysts to fear that uncertainty will cause more insurers to flee the program. \nDemocrats said the GOP’s murky plans are already “sabotaging” the law. \n“Republicans’ refusal to provide certainty is harming American business and middle-class consumers,” said Rep. Richard Neal, Massachusetts Democrats and top-ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. “Republicans complain there is lack of choice, but it is their policies that are causing competition to wither.” \nMr. Trump yanked up to $5 million in advertising for HealthCare.gov, the federal Obamacare website, during the critical final week of 2017 signups last month. \nUltimately, the number of people selecting plans on the website dropped 4 percent this go-around compared to the 2016 season. \nDemocrats immediately blamed Mr. Trump, saying signups had been running ahead of schedule while Mr. Obama was overseeing things, but enthusiasm appeared to wane in the final days after Mr. Trump took over. \nThey say the GOP should fix the law instead with more generous subsidies or a government-run “public option” to compete with private plans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:56:14.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
