Yes, he’ll be 37 years old this season and was limited to 20 starts last season due to blister issues, but Rich Hill is 14-6 with a 2.00 ERA, 0.93 WHIP and 165 strikeouts in 139 1/3 innings since returning to the mound as a starter in September of 2015 for the Boston Red Sox . He also threw six shutout innings against the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS. We’re talking ace upside for sure. \nSo the upside here is the Dodgers could have three aces at the top come playoff time. They’ll get there by way of depth, too. \nKenta Maeda was 16-11 with a 3.48 ERA in his first year in America. Given that he’s not even 30 years old yet, betting on an improvement in Year 2 is a sound decision. \nAlso in the mix are lefties Scott Kazmir , Hyun-Jin Ryu , Alex Wood along with righties Brandon McCarthy , Ross Stripling and Brock Stewart . \nYou could actually make two pretty good rotations here. Watch. \nTeam Blue: Kershaw, Maeda, Kazmir, McCarthy, Stripling Team White: Hill, Urias, Ryu, Wood, Stewart \nSome of this depth could be used to trade for bullpen help, sure, but it could also just be used to absorb injuries (there are questions around at least Hill, Kazmir, McCarthy, Ryu and Wood) and Urias’ innings limit. A few of these guys could also be used in the bullpen. Some of the best relievers were failed starters, after all. Kenley Jansen returns as the bullpen ace \nHad Jansen signed elsewhere, the Dodgers would have been left with a gaping hole at the back of the bullpen. Closer Pedro Baez ? Not bad, but not ideal. Now Sergio Romo joins Baez in setting up for one of the league’s elite relievers in Jansen. \nJansen had a 1.83 ERA, 0.67 WHIP and 104 strikeouts again nine unintentional walks last season. Just a ridiculous stat line. He also showed in the playoffs that he’s capable of becoming the multi-inning beast that became a huge emphasis this past postseason. \nLost in the shuffle of the Dodgers’ NLCS loss to the Cubs was that Jansen totally dominated the champs. In three appearances, he worked 6 1/3 innings, allowing zero runs and just one hit (a single) while striking out 10 and not walking anyone. He threw three perfect innings in Game 6 as he watched his offense fail to close the gap. Kenley Jansen is back with the Dodgers. USATSI \nHaving the presence of a talent like Jansen just makes the entire bullpen better. \nFinally, it should be noted that while we’re talking pitching, catcher Yasmani Grandal is one of the best at framing in the majors. Every little bit helps. The path to the World Series goes through the champs \nThe San Francisco Giants and maybe Colorado Rockies pose a threat in the NL West, while the Washington Nationals and New York Mets look to be potential NL contenders. Maybe the St. Louis Cardinals and/or Pittsburgh Pirates return to the playoffs, and we’re probably due a surprise surge from some other team. \nThe most legitimate reason, however, that the Dodgers couldn’t win the National League pennant is the one team that prevented them from doing so last season. \nThe Cubs don’t look much worse. In fact, there are reasons to believe in some areas that they’ll be even better. SportsLine simulations have the Cubs winning 103 games again and the Dodgers with 94 wins. Still, that gets both teams to the playoffs, where anything can happen. \nOn the flip side, some other computers either have the teams closer together or love the Dodgers. Fangraphs has the Cubs winning 95 and the Dodgers at 94. Baseball Prospectus’ PECOTA has the Dodgers at 99 wins compared to the Cubs at 91. \nIt’s hard to see the Dodgers missing the playoffs in 2017, but the story of the season will be incomplete until we see what happens in October. A fifth straight NL West title will seem rather insignificant if it’s followed by an early exit in the playoffs. If they’re to finally get over the hump, it’s likely to happen with them toppling the defending champion Cubs. They have the talent to pull it off, but they’ve had the talent to win it all the past four years.
