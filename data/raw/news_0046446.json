Real also set a club record of scoring in 42 consecutive games in all competitions.\nThey top the standings on 52 points, four clear of Barcelona who host Leganes on Sunday while Sevilla, in third on 46, entertain Eibar later on Saturday. Real have two games in hand on both their title rivals.\nEarlier on Saturday, Kevin Gameiro came off the bench to score a hat-trick in the space of five minutes to fire Atletico Madrid to a 4-1 win over struggling Sporting Gijon that kept them fourth in the standings on 45 points.\nYannick Carrasco had given Atletico the lead 12 seconds into the second half but Sergio Alvarez gave the impressive home side a deserved equaliser in the 49th minute.\nSporting continued to cause Diego Simeone 's side problems after drawing level and Alvarez missed a gilt-edged chance to put them ahead when he sent a half-volley over the bar from close range.\nFor the second week in a row, however, Atletico dug deep to rescue the points from an unconvincing display.\nAntoine Griezmann had a goal harshly ruled out for offside but laid on the pass for Gameiro's first strike, the former Sevilla player calmly rounding Ivan Cuellar to put Atletico ahead in the 80th minute.\nGameiro ruthlessly killed off Sporting with two quick-fire strikes, latching on to a pass from Thomas Partey to score in the 81st minute and taking advantage of another through ball from Griezmann to complete his treble.\nThe Frenchman is the first Atletico player to score a hat-trick in the league as a substitute while his treble was the second fastest in the history of La Liga, behind only Bebeto's for Deportivo La Coruna against Albacete in 1995.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T12:59:34.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
