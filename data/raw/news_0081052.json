You can always work across the parliamentary chamber to ensure that significant reforms such as this get through,\" Ms Trad said. \n\"It's clear that because the LNP has decided to vote as a bloc against modernising abortion laws in Queensland, both bills that the Member for Cairns has introduced will fail tomorrow night.\" \nMr Pyne defended the drafting of his bills but thanked the Government for referring the issue to the QLRC. \n\"I think the stain of having a politician having the moved (the amendments) will be removed by going through this process,\" Mr Pyne said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:20:43.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
