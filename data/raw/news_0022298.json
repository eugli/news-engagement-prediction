REUTERS/Noah Berger By Derek Caney \nThe Justice Department took a beating from appellate judges reviewing President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. All three judges from the 9 th Circuit Court of Appeals hammered the central point from the Justice Department's attorney, August Flentje, that people from those countries are a danger to national security. \nFlentje tried to fall back on former President Barack Obama's determination that those nations –, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen – pose the greatest risk of terrorism. Asked for specific examples of terrorist threats, Flentje muttered something about \"a number of people from Somalia connected to Al Shabaab,\" but he submitted no such evidence to the courts. \nThe court wasn't buying everything the state of Washington was selling either. The state successfully won a block of the travel ban in a lower court. But Judge Richard Clifton, a George W. Bush appointee, hit Washington state's attorney Noah Purcell particularly hard on his point that the travel ban was effectively discrimination against Muslims. \nPurcell noted that past statements from Trump indicated intent to discriminate – namely by calling for a ban of all Muslims. He also made a passing reference to Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani's Fox News interview from Jan. 28, in which the former New York City mayor said: \n\"When he first announced it, he said 'Muslim ban.' He called me up. He said: ' Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.' … And what we did was we focused on – instead of religion – danger.\" \nA final decision is expected this week. \nEat your heart out, Milan A model waits backstage during Ukrainian Fashion Week in Kiev, Ukraine Feb. 7, 2017.

The White House also vowed to defend \"international territories\" in the strategic waterway. But Defense Secretary Jim Mattis walked it back saying diplomacy should be the priority in the region. \n- Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Trump agreed in a phone call overnight to act jointly against Islamic State in the Syrian towns of al-Bab and Raqqa, both controlled by the militants, Turkish presidency sources said. The two leaders discussed issues including a safe zone in Syria, the refugee crisis and the fight against terror, the sources said. \nAround Wall Street \n-With the possibility of an election by June, Italian politicians of all stripes are tapping into growing hostility towards the euro .
