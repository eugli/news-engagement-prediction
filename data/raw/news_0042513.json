(Scott Serio / Baltimore Sun Media Group) Kathi Santora For Harford Magazine Get to know Susquehannock Wildlife Society President Scott McDaniel. \n“I know it sounds like a cliché,” says Scott McDaniel, 34, “but the idea for the Susquehannock Wildlife Society really did happen around a campfire.” \nThe lifelong nature lover, self-employed filmmaker and network security account manager became the new organization’s president. \nThe wildlife society’s goal is to protect the natural world in the Susquehanna River regions of Harford and Cecil counties as well as Pennsylvania’s York and Lancaster counties. The organization established an animal rescue program, set up a trail camera survey that monitors animal activity, fortified local habitats for the declining Baltimore checkerspot butterfly and sponsored educational programs. \nNow the group is developing the Susquehannock Wildlife Center on a 20-acre Darlington property, and McDaniel is executive director of the center, which is eyeing a public opening at the end of next year. \nTalk about this land and its future. \nYou’ve heard the expression that Maryland is “America in Miniature?” We think this 20 acres is almost Harford County in miniature. It contains wetlands, forests, meadowland and various elevations. The Hopkins Branch of Deer Creek flows right through it.
