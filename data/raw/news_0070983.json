I want to be able to offer what I have to offer them beyond industry constraints that I don't need to be constrained by, and not beholden to concerns that aren't my concerns,\" Leo said in a statement. \n\"My connection with the audience has always been one of the most important parts of this whole 'life as a working artist' thing that I try to maintain, and Kickstarter has taken a situation that worked AGAINST that connection and flipped it on its head, allowing me an even more direct channel through which the rewards of interaction, art and audience, audience and artist, can flow more freely, and enable empowerment and sustainability to hopefully keep it going for an even longer time to come. I look at it as achieving autonomy via the support of the community, and I'm very excited for the future it portends.\" More News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:46:17.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
