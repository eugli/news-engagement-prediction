It's the skipper's resting state, his comfort zone. He doesn't have much use for outsiders' opinions about his club, unless those views can be used to create a motivational edge for himself and his players. This approach is not unique. \nMany coaches and players operate this way. You see examples of it often, none more obvious than when champions go on and on about how reporters wrote them off — even if they were the heavy favorites all along. Perhaps one contrarian really did. Perhaps Skip Bayless tweeted something stupid and that ballooned into \"The Media.\" Or perhaps the \"doubters,\" \"haters\" (or any other applicable terms) existed only in their minds. For these teams, it's \"us against them.\" Always. \nThis is a long-winded way of saying Matheny will probably always look for and seize upon perceived slights that he can turn into fuel. \nBut the manager's latest example of what he believes to be a media misstep is a reach, even for Matheny. \nIn fact, you could argue the criticism fits Matheny more than it fits the media. \nHere's the questionable quote in its entirety: \n\"It’s amazing how little regard people actually put into how many young players we put on the field last year,\" Matheny told ESPN's Mark Saxon in a recent Q&A. \"The conversation kept going all season long without people really acknowledging it. We had to throw Aledmys Diaz into the lineup at the last second when he had spent the previous season at Double-A. Kolten [Wong] really hasn’t found the traction in the league yet. Those two guys were in the middle. We had to search to find a center fielder, and Randal Grichuk hadn’t spent a full season in the big leagues. Our right fielder [Stephen Piscotty] hadn’t spent a full season in the big leagues. Four of the eight position players were in the minor leagues the previous year. Everyone wants to hold them to the level of consistency, and they’re not polished veterans yet. It’s absurd. We had smart people covering our team who don’t want to give that much credit. They don’t understand the importance of experience. It just takes time. They’re being asked to do something completely different at every level. It’s different. It’s tougher at every level. This team should be in contention, I get it, but we put people in some of the most important positions on the field who haven’t even established themselves as big leaguers.\" \nWe're not going to go down the journalistic rabbit hole of how silly it is to label individual reporters as one entity. And we will dismiss the suggestion that the Cardinals, who market themselves as a team that will contend for the World Series every season, should not be held to the exact standard they both set and profit greatly from. Forget all of that for now. Here's the part of the quote that should make you scratch your head. \n\"Everyone wants to hold them to the level of consistency, and they’re not polished veterans yet. It’s absurd. We had smart people covering our team who don’t want to give that much credit. They don’t understand the importance of experience. It just takes time.\" \nI must have missed the media mob that called for Aledmys Diaz's demotion last season. Did it arrive before or after many questioned the Cardinals' decision to sign the unimpressive Ruben Tejada instead of invest in Diaz? \nIt was Matheny, not the people covering his team, who demoted Kolten Wong, then had the second baseman experiment in the outfield before he was reassigned to the bench. \nAnd it was Matheny who marched Randal Grichuk up and down the lineup and demoted him not once but twice, only to arrive at the conclusion that the slugger might benefit from the chance to play through some difficulties without fearing loss of playing time. \n“I’m hoping this will give him a little more room to breathe,\" Matheny said at the time, the closest he came to publicly acknowledging that his previous handling of Grichuk could have been what sucked the air out of the room. \nGrichuk responded after he received the kind of trust Matheny so often reserves for struggling veterans. He started the last 44 games of the season and slugged .552 with 10 homers. He's scheduled to be the starting left fielder now that Dexter Fowler has joined the team. \nWong, who saw his playing time last season decrease as Grichuk settled in, never received the assurance that Matheny gave to Grichuk. It could come in 2017. Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak has been quite candid in his belief that Wong should be the everyday starter at second. If the Cardinals truly want to achieve their goal of being more athletic, Wong has to be on the field. \nDiaz overcame a bout of early errors — and a criminally low spot in the batting order for half of his at-bats — to become an All-Star. If it wasn't for a broken thumb, he would have made a more serious push for National League Rookie of the Year. But if it wasn't for injuries to Jhonny Peralta and Tejada, it might not have happened at all. He too enters spring training as a starter. \nMatheny is correct to point out the Cardinals' youth, especially after former Cardinals outfielder Jason Heyward's \"aging core\" comments were distorted to describe a team in decline. That the Cardinals are entering a new season banking on these young players suggests they see their current potential and what they can become. It also raises the question of what might have happened last season if some of these guys earned their manager's trust sooner. Did the struggles happen because of the youth, or because of Matheny's handling of it? \nIf anyone needs to be reminded of the importance of letting the young guys learn on the job, it's not the media. \nIt's the manager.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:35:38.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
