We see the best of the best trampoline out of the United States to yield high-level, high-paying salaries in top tier professions,\" Kurland said.\n\"We are reaping human capital the same way America reaped human capital during that awful World War II period, where the brightest and the best departed Europe for the sanctuary of America.\"\nThe requests are primarily coming from tech industry workers, Kurland said, almost all of whom are Muslims concerned about the direction the U.S. is taking.\n\"The word repeated in eight out of 10 interviews was 'fear.' And I've never seen that before,\" he said. \"These are highly educated, PhD-level or senior executives who said they've had enough.\"\nIn the U.S., major tech companies, including Google and Amazon, utilize the country’s H1B visas to recruit thousands of foreign professionals to work in America for an allotted time period.\nMicrosoft alone currently has 5,000 such workers in the country, according to reports.\nBut in the wake of Trump's travel ban, which was put on hold by the courts but is expected to be replaced next week, some firms have announced they are considering moving their hires to other countries instead.\nSeeking to capitalize on the trend, entrepreneur Michael Tippett recently launched True North, a company geared toward relocating workers and setting up satellite offices in Vancouver.\nTippett said he's already fielding hundreds of requests from Silicon Valley.\n\"People are concerned things might change in unpredictable ways and they want to set up, essentially, an insurance policy where they can move people up here in the event something unexpected happened,\" he said.\nIt’s all welcome news to the B.C. government, which has prioritized growing the province’s tech sector. Jobs Minister Shirley Bond said a surge in skilled workers could create a ripple effect in the industry.\n\"We will continue to make sure that the tech sector knows it's welcome here in British Columbia,\" Bond said.\nWith a report from CTV Vancouver's Penny Daflos \n  \nRelated Stories The impact on Canadians if Trump slashes legal immigration to the U.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:15:44.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
