On the ground where he hit 178 against Australia in his previous one-day appearance, another big score seemed possible as he reached his century in the 25th over but he only faced seven more balls before he was caught on the point boundary.\nMost of the bowlers took heavy punishment but Suranga Lakmal claimed three wickets while conceding 71 runs in ten overs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:14:48.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
