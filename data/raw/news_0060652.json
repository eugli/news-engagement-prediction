It becomes a crowd around a fading dynasty. This now seems obvious in the case of the Congress\". \n\nThe Congress, he said, has \"lost its image as a responsible political organisation\". \"From a natural party of governance, it has moved to the fringe. Its policies have alienated its constituency of the poor aam aadmi,\" he added. \n\nJaitley further said parties which adopt dynastic succession as an alternative to merit-based leadership creation suffer from a natural disadvantage. \n\n\"Tall leaders do not grow in such parties. The strength of the party overlaps with the charisma of the current generation of the dynasty,\" he said. \n\nReferring to note ban decision, the minister said the Congress' stand on demonetisation of high value currency \"is costing it dearly\". \n\n\"The poor have overwhelmingly supported demonetisation. The Congress party has lost its traditional constituency of the poor electorate to the BJP,\" the minister said. \n\nHe said the disruptive role played by the Congress in Parliament has projected it \"more as a fringe rather than a mainstream political party\".
