Separately, more than 60 former patients have also filed police complaints alleging that Nassar, a sports medicine doctor, molested them under the guise of pelvic procedures. \nNassar was fired by USA Gymnastics, which oversees national competitive gymnastics, and by Michigan State University, where he had his practice. Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar appears in court Friday in Michigan on sex abuse charges. NBC News \nIn a statement Sunday — shortly before three elite U.S. gymnasts outlined their allegations on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" — USA Gymnastics said that it was \"appalled that anyone would exploit a young athlete or child in the manner alleged\" and that it had cooperated fully with the FBI. \nThe organization also said that it had hired Deborah Daniels, a former U.S. attorney for southern Indiana and assistant attorney general in the administration of President George W. Bush, to conduct a \"comprehensive independent review of USA Gymnastics bylaws, policies, procedures and practices.\" \nDaniels is expected to submit her recommendations in the spring or early summer, USA Gymnastics said. \n\"Nothing is more important to USA Gymnastics than protecting young people,\" the organization said. \"Their health and well-being is our priority, and USA Gymnastics is committed to doing everything we can to promote a safe environment for athletes.\" Alex Johnson ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:04:23.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
