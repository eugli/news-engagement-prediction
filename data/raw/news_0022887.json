It has said that, since France - like Germany - long since switched to using the euro, storing gold for foreign currency swaps in Paris is no longer necessary.\nThe bank has not released any details as to how it transported the gold home.\nThe original plan was for the transfers to be completed by 2020, but the bank brought forward the transfers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T19:26:47.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
