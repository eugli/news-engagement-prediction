Over a year since the tragic passing of her beloved husband René Angélil , the Power of Love singer admitted that she has become the “leader” of her family. \"When [René] left, he came inside of all of my kids' hearts and mine, he gave the rest of his 50 percent for me to be complete, to continue the rest of my life, to feel strong and to believe that I can still do this and he will always be with me,\" the mum-of-three —René-Charles, 16, Eddy, six, and Nelson, six — told Entertainment Tonight. \nSTORY:Celine Dion offers Beyoncé twin baby advice: 'I think it's a double blessing' Celine opened up about the death of her husband \n\"I feel stronger,\" Celine added. \"He gave me the rest of him.
