Yes. All of these things are good, but I think you have to make sure the system is working.” . @RandPaul : 40% of people who come to visit our country on a visa overstay their visa https://t.co/vOgUi8OMVR \n— Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) January 31, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:29:00.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
