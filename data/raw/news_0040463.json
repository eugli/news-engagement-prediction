Eighteenth Street Lounge \nMore often than not, tipsters, readers, friends and family of Eater have one question: Where should I drink right now? While the Eater 38 is a crucial resource covering old standbys and neighborhood essential restaurants across the city and the Eater Heat Map highlights where the restaurant loving crowds are flocking to at the moment, neither of these properly cover the bars and restaurants where cocktail aficionados and beer nerds are drinking right now. \nAnd so the time has come to update the Drinks Heat Map. Rather than feature the perennial favorites (though drinkers can find those here ), this guide focuses on operations that are newer or have recently made significant changes. \nThis time around, we have additions such as Chinatown's Free State Bar , a booze-heavy watering hole tucked beneath Bantam King, For Rent , which welcomes trespassers under downtown's Vieux Carre, and Addendum , located inside Eighteenth Street Lounge. And stay tuned for more places to imbibe, as Trevor Frye's Five to One, David Strauss' Morris , and The Line hotel's lineup prepare to join the party. \nSee a new hot spot missing on this list? Tell us: dc@eater.com. 1 Addendum \nThe new bar-in-bar within Eighteenth Street Lounge has house-made ingredients and bitters going into its upscale cocktails served in crystal glassware.
