John R.K. Howard The parents of the victim left Friday's hearing in a fury after a lawyer representing John R.K. Howard claimed they had made up their son's assault in order to sue Dietrich High School for $10 million, the Twin Falls Times-News reported . Howard, 19, entered an Alford plea in December to the lesser charge of felony injury of a child. In the plea, which is considered a guilty plea, Howard maintained his innocence but acknowledged that prosecutors likely would have been able to convict him. Howard originally was charged with forcible sexual penetration by a foreign object and faced a sentence of up to life in prison if convicted in the October 2015 incident . According to the family's lawsuit, a football teammate pretended to give the victim a hug and then Howard and Tanner Ray Ward assaulted him with a clothes hanger. \nWard pleaded guilty in juvenile court; his charge is not known because the court records are sealed. The other teen, whose name has not been released, also was charged in juvenile court. \nThe family contended that the assault of the victim, who is black, came after months of racially charged abuse. The victim was \"taunted and called racist names by other members of the team which names included 'Kool-Aid' 'chicken eater' 'watermelon' and [the N-word],\" the lawsuit says. \nThe lawsuit also claimed that football coaches told their players to fight the victim — who suffers \"mental disorders including learning disabilities\" — to make him tougher. Keller teen pleads guilty, avoids prison in coat-hanger assault of mentally disabled Idaho teammate \nHoward's lawyers denied those claims Friday to the Times-News. \n\"The racist stuff, it's not there,\" attorney Brad Calbo said, adding that the case had been \"blown out of proportion for the pursuit of money.\" \nCalbo said Friday that an audio recording of the victim shows that the victim made up the assault at the behest of his parents. \nIn addition to the victim, several of his friends and teammates and two football coaches are heard on the recording, the Times-News reported. Several people tell the victim that they love him and that he needs to be honest. \n\"It was never my intentions,\" he says. \"It was just all them, all my parents. … I was fed lies and I said it and I signed it because I was pressured.\" \nThe victim goes on to say that his father promised that they would move to the Bahamas after winning the civil lawsuit. \nBut in a deposition last week, the victim recanted his recantation. \n\"All that stuff, I just made up,\" he said about the previous recording, which was made by the coaches. \"I just started telling a bunch of just lies because I wanted my friends back.\" \nThe victim's lawyer, Lee Schlender, said the coaches' recording likely helped Howard's criminal case and called it a \"despicable\" thing to do. Does a 'Texas culture of racial hatred' share blame for rape of disabled Idaho teen? \n\"That was such a contrived, ugly thing to do to him,\" Schlender said. \"As he explained, he told them what they wanted to hear.\" \nHoward had been sent to live with relatives in the Idaho town of Dietrich, to keep him out of trouble, according to the lawsuit. He has since moved back to Texas. \nIf he violates his probation, he could face up to 10 years in prison. But the judge — who called the incident \"bullying\" — also cleared a path for his conviction to be dismissed later by entering a withheld judgment at Friday's hearing.
