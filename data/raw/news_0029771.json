FAIRFAX NZ \nRadio Active DJs, left to right, Phil Reed, Liam Ryan and Lucy von Sturmer in the studio in 2010. \nIt would go on to champion the early careers of some of Wellington's most-successful bands including Fat Freddy's Drop, Phoenix Foundation, and Trinity Roots. John Campbell's early broadcasting was there when it was still a student station. \nREAD MORE: \nWhile it had never been a money-making station, Bagnall said the past few years had seen him having to prop the station up with his own money as online advertising cut into the station's ability to make money. JEFF McEWAN \nRadio Active 89FM One Love Concert draws the crowds in 2006. \n\"I have decided I didn't want to keep doing that. \n\"It would certainly be a liquidation [eventually] but in the short-term ... it just won't be trading.\" \nStaff were being told on Monday morning. ROBERT KITCHIN/FAIRFAX NZ \nRadio Active DJ Liam Luff in the Victoria Street studios IN 2007. \nThe station would be turning 40 this year. \n\"It is sad. I'm hoping that someone else will keep it alive. But if no-one steps up it will be the end of Radio Active.\" \nBut Radio Active station manager Dave Gibbons was adamant the station was not going to close. \n\"All we are doing is winding up the limited liability [company],\" he said. \nThe station did, though, need money to stay afloat and asked if it had investors putting their hands up, Gibbons said, \"potentially, yes\". \nPhoenix Foundation's Samuel Flynn Scott said the station's championing of new music had lasted decades and staff were approachable and encouraging even as a young band turning up with a burnt CD of their latest track. \nIf it hadn't been for Active \"I don't know how we would have got our music out at all\", Scott said. \nBroadcaster John Campbell said \"there is no doubt in my mind\" that his career started as a result of Active, which was still a student station at Victoria University when he was involved. \n\"It was the most glorious fun - it was just sheer joy being part of Radio Active.\" \nAs a result of being heard doing an alternative rugby commentary on Active he was offered a cadetship as a business reporter at Radio NZ. \nHe remembered the station \"introducing a lot of white folk in Wellington to hip-hop\". \nWellington publicist Sarah Hunter - who has worked for the likes of Taki Rua, Roots Foundation, Fat Freddy's, The Nudge, and Trinity Roots - said the station's heyday was in the late 1990s to early 2000s, when thousands flocked to its annual One Love public concerts on Waitangi Day. \n\"To make a gig happen you just had to have Radio Active support it,\" she said. \nThe landscape for radio was changing but there was a \"whole raft\" of independent stations - such as Sweet Sounz which ran out of Berhampore, Wellington - now operating on small budgets and streaming online without big overhead costs. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:03:44.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
