When I came back, I had one of the most scary experiences and felt lost!\" says the actor. Apparently, when he stepped into the room, Sudev found that all his luggage was gone and there was no trace of anyone being there, ever.\n\"I couldn't understand what was happening and was also confused about how to go about it. I had to soon get back to shoot and get ready as well. The room appeared as if someone wiped off everything, just in a click,\" says the State Award winner actor.\nInterestingly, the incident had a funny twist towards the end. \"Well, apparently, I was at the wrong hotel! Funnily enough, none of us - the hotel staff who handed over the key to me, our crew or even myself, didn't realize it for a long time until someone sorted it out. Once we figured what exactly happened, we had a mass sigh of relief,\" says Sudev, laughing.\nThe film, starring Prithviraj and Priya Anand in the lead, will hit screens on February 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:52:36.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
