Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nIt is also forecast to improve the budget bottom line by $2.5 billion a year. \nMr Bowen's unwillingness to consider a Buffett-type policy is likely to lead to internal ructions inside the ALP. \nA senior figure on the Left pointed out on Wednesday that both Mr Bowen and Mr Shorten and their Right faction had voted to adopt a Buffett rule into Labor's tax platform at the 2015 national conference. \nThe policy sits on the platform as \"future tax reforms\" to be considered. \nThe Left has asked Labor's upcoming national policy forum, made up of parliamentarians, union officials and rank-and-file members, to consider progressing a 'Buffett rule' as a priority before a likely debate at national conference next year. \nTim Ayres, the NSW secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and a member of Labor's national executive, said inequality was the biggest driver of right-wing populism. \n\"Labor and the labour movement have to take serious policy positions that even two years ago would have been outside the political orthodoxy and previously unthinkable. Without some new policies in response to what is going on, people in the suburbs and regions will give up on progressive politics in favour of the far right,\" he said. \nBut Mr Bowen signalled no change in focus from current policies on negative gearing and capital gains tax. \n\"We understand Australians' concerns that higher income individuals might at times abuse the tax system,\" he said. \n\"Labor has shown we're serious about cracking down on tax concessions that benefit high income earners. We have policies on superannuation, negative gearing and capital gains that ensure our tax concessions are made fairer and sustainable.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:42:47.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
