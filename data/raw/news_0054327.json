I’m just excited to attack another year at the club.” \nGibbs enjoyed arguably a career-best year at Carlton in 2016, averaging 26.8 disposals through the midfield and registering 18 goals from 22 matches. \nBut the 27-year-old believes he’s felt as good as ever throughout the club’s current pre-season program and says he’s looking forward to resuming action. \n“It’s completely fine,” Gibbs said. \n“There were a few things going on towards the end of last year and I seeked a trade back to Adelaide. That didn’t happen. (But) it wasn’t a football decision. \n“It’s been publicised why I seeked a trade. It had nothing to do with footy, which is why going back to the club was really smooth and really easy. \n“From day one of pre-season, it was back to business as usual and I’ve enjoyed pre-season — my 11th one at Carlton — more than I ever have.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:20:05.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
