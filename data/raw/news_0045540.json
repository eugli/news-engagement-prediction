Chairman Husbands attitude threatens pregnant wives more – Exec. Chairman On 6:20 pm In News by Nwafor Polycarp Comments \nThe attitude of some husbands in Bauchi state constituted a threat to the well-being of their pregnant wives more than other challenges, the Executive Chairman, Bauchi State Primary Healthcare Development Agency (BSPHCDA),Mr Adamu Gamawa said on Tuesday. \nBriefing newsmen in Bauchi on the Maternal Newborn and Child Health Week (MNCHW), Gamawa said such husbands had prevented their pregnant wives from attending antenatal clinics (ANC). \nHe attributed such negative disposition by husbands to Antenatal Clinics to some long-standing cultural beliefs and customs. Pregnant-mother \nHe said that husbands needed to pick interest in the health of their pregnant wives to reduce the rate of mortality resulting from improper medical guidance during pregnancies. \n“It is high time that husbands become seriously involved in issues of attending ANC by pregnant women to enable the detection of pregnancy complications at early stage. \n“Nigeria is said to have 10 per cent of maternal mortality in the world; this is too high. \n“Most pregnant women in the want to attend ANC but because of cultural belief, their husbands tend to stop them, thereby risking their lives,’’ he said. \nGamawa said that N10 million had been released for observation of the Maternal Newborn and Child Health week (MNCHW) in the state, adding that an estimated 400,000 pregnant and 1.4 million children under age of 5, were to be captured during the week-long exercise, which commenced on Monday. \nHe said that over 600 Primary Health Centers (PHC) across the 323 wards of the 20 Local Governments Areas in the state would be involved.
