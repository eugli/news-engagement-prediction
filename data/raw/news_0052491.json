Now reports suggest, that the company might also launch the 2017 250 Duke in India, with spy shots recently surfaced on the internet. \nNow, there are also reports that say that KTM might just launch the new 250 Duke instead of the 200 Duke. We had earlier reported that KTM has discontinued the production of the 200 Duke to make way for the 250 Duke. \nDesign: \nThe new 250 Duke will be based on the design philosophy of the 2017 390 Duke, but might miss out on some premium features. These include LED headlamps and ride by wire system. However, the new 250 Duke will get ABS as standard and new LCD instrumentation console. \nEngine: \nAccording to reports, the new 250 Duke will come with a 248.8cc single cylinder liquid cooled engine that produces maximum power output of 31 hp and maximum torque of 24NM, mated to a six-speed transmission and will comply with BS-IV emission norms. 2017 KTM 250 Duke \nFeatures: \nNow, not much is known of the India-spec Duke 250, but from the spy shots, the new 250 Duke will come with new MRF Revz-FC1 and Revz-C1 tyres, and the instrument cluster from the outgoing 200 Duke. \nCompetition: \nThe new KTM 250 Duke will go up against the newly launched Yamaha FZ-25 in India. \nPrice: \nWe expect the new 250 Duke to come for a price of Rs 1.7 lakh (ex showroom, New Delhi) - Rs 1.9 lakh (ex showroom, New Delhi). It will be placed between the 200 Duke and 390 Duke in India. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:39:41.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
