The facility plans also incorporate justice programs like Crown counsel, community corrections, and a Justice Access Centre, as well as a parkade to supplement parking requirements for the City of Abbotsford. \nThe estimated $150-million project will proceed through requests for qualifications and proposals in 2017 with design and construction expected to commence in mid-2018. It is estimated that the project will also create over 1,000 jobs during the course of construction and will be open and operating in 2021. \nLocated in one of B.C.’s fastest-growing regions, Abbotsford’s new courthouse is part of the Lower Fraser Valley Court Strategy, which is based on demographic and courtroom demand analysis over the next 20 years. \nThe B.C. government is making record investments in modern, safe infrastructure projects throughout the province – and in doing so, these construction projects are creating well-paying, family-supporting jobs. \nQuotes: \nSuzanne Anton, Attorney General and Minister of Justice – \n“Our government is committed to increasing court capacity to enhance access to justice in British Columbia. With this new courthouse facility in Abbotsford, we are taking action for the fast-growing Lower Fraser Valley region. The commitment to build a new Abbotsford courthouse ensures cases will be heard expeditiously and is a giant step forward for justice in this region.” \nAmrik Virk, Minister of Technology, Innovation and Citizens’ Services – \n“The new courthouse will not only double the size and capacity of courthouse services in Abbotsford, it will also provide easier access to justice services for citizens.” \nMichael de Jong, MLA for Abbostford West – \n“As a rapidly growing centre for business, leisure and culture, Abbotsford is a centre of activities in the Fraser Valley. The demands of this flourishing community will be met by construction of the new courthouse and will ensure residents and businesses have a strong base for expansion for the next 20 years.” \nHenry Braun, mayor of Abbotsford – \n“The City of Abbotsford is proud to partner with the Province of B.C. for this much needed and significant investment in our community. The new Abbotsford courthouse will help to shape the evolving face of our City Centre and provide services to residents across our region, further establishing Abbotsford as the Hub of the Fraser Valley.” \nQuick Facts: The Lower Fraser Valley Court Strategy identifies the most effective way to address courtroom pressures based on demographic and court demand analysis over the next 20 years. Priority projects are expansion of the Surrey courthouse, currently underway, and construction of a new courthouse in Abbotsford. Abbotsford courthouse goes to request for proposal (RFP) later in 2017. With 89 court locations throughout the province, 96% of British Columbians live within an hour of a staffed court location. \nLearn More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:42:13.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
