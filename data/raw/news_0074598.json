Everything from beginning to end is like a real courtroom, and I personally consider each case as a trial.\"\nJudge Wapner received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2009 Judge Wapner became better known than the top judges on the US Supreme Court, many of whom were said to be fans of the show.\nHe once settled a dispute between David Letterman and Johnny Carson on the latter's The Tonight Show.\nA truck owned by Mr Letterman had been towed away from a street in Malibu at Mr Carson's request, after he said it was an eyesore.\nThe truck had damaged headlights when return to Mr Letterman, however, and Judge Wapner awarded him $24.95.\nThe popularity of the TV court declined in the early 1990s, but flourished again from 1997 after the launch of Judge Judy, a show which Judge Wapner said he did not watch.\nJoseph Wapner received his law degree from the University of Southern California in 1948. He was awarded with the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart for his service during the Second World War.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/B3F1/production/_94856064_gettyimages-93016325.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/10211/production/_94856066_3d249e54-20ef-43c9-8952-662100e7e553.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-27T02:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:22:36.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
