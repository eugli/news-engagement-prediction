ESPN analysts Jay Williams and Jay Bilas discussed Kentucky’s chances to win the national championship Saturday morning on ESPN’s College GameDay. Williams said he worried about the Wildcats’“mental fortitude.” “My only thing is mental fortitude, right? When we were at that game against Kansas, JB, one of the things I saw, this team was this team looked disoriented,” Williams said. “This team looked like they were fragmented. Nobody stepped up and said hey, follow me here. And that’s a question we have for Kentucky as the season continues to progress.” “Yeah, but I think they looked like that at times in maybe 2013 or maybe 2011. Times in the middle of the season where you’re saying, ‘well wait a minute, this team doesn’t look like a national championship team and then they wind up in the Final Four,’” Bilas responded. “Like they’re good enough to be at the Final Four. I wouldn’t put them as a favorite for the national championship because I think they’re too easy to attack at the four spot. I think that’s where they’re vulnerable, is at the four spot. But they’re still really good. And there’s still a lot of time left in the season this last month, month and a half where they can put something together and make a good run and wind up in Phoenix.” Kentucky remains one of the top few favorites in Las Vegas to capture the NCAA Championship, and the Wildcats are ranked above both Kansas and Arizona, two teams Bilas later listed as favorites to capture the title, in KenPom.
