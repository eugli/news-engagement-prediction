It was basically to say, ‘Look, we’re coming into office in a couple of weeks. Give us some time to take a look at everything.’” \nFlynn, however, decried the leaks related to his conversations. \n“In some of these cases, you’re talking about stuff that’s taken off of a classified system and given to a reporter. That’s a crime,” Flynn told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group during a telephone interview from his White House office on Monday. \n“You call them leaks. It’s a criminal act. This is a crime. It’s not just a wink and a nod,” Flynn said. \nFlynn said he didn’t know the origin of the leaks. “One has to wonder, ‘Are they coming out of people in the National Security Council? Are they coming out of people in the intel community? Or State? Or Defense?’” \nPresident Donald Trump also commented on the leaks in a tweet, saying, “The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?” \nIn saying that these are leaks, media has not been spelling out a very important fact. \nSomeone leaked private conversations Flynn had on his phone and offered them to media. \nHow did the people get the conversations? Who tapped his phone? Or did someone have access to NSA information? \nAs we have noted previously, the FBI looked at Flynn’s conversations in January and confirmed at that time that Flynn had not done anything illicit. \nBut the campaign to leak his conversations certainly appears illicit and everyone should be concerned, if someone is tapping the conversations of the National Security Advisor, as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes notes. \nNunes said it’s troubling the call was tapped with the information later being leaked to the media, adding he hopes to receive more information form the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \n“I expect for the FBI to tell me what is going on, and they better have a good answer,” he told The Washington Post. “The big problem I see here is that you have an American citizen who had his phone calls recorded.” \nNunes also said he did believe there was a “well-orchestrated effort to attack Flynn and others in the administration.” \n“From the leaking of phone calls between the president and foreign leaders to what appears to be high-level [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court] information, to the leaking of American citizens being denied security clearances, it looks like a pattern.” […] \nFormer intelligence and military officers told TheDCNF they agree Flynn was the victim of a highly orchestrated “disinformation campaign” generated by current and former intelligence officers, many with loyalties to former President Obama. \nNunes said the House would be investigating the leaks. \nLet’s hope that there are still people dedicated to the truth at the FBI who can get to the bottom of this.
