As the sequel to 2001's show #BluePlanet , the #BBC plans to go further and deeper than ever before. If that weren't enough, original narrator #DavidAttenborough is avoiding retirement and will once again be the one to take us on the nautical journey. Dive Into The Wonder 'Blue Planet' [Credit: BBC] \nPlunging in after the success of last year's Planet Earth II , the BBC is clearly keen to capitalize on the nostalgia factor of its #nature documentaries. The sequel to 2006's #PlanetEarth brought in the most viewers for a natural history program in at least 15 years and averaged an audience of 10 million. With Attenborough reportedly on the cusp of retirement, his final speech on Planet Earth II seemed like the perfect swansong for his illustrious career, but it seems that you can't keep an old dog down. The announcement of Blue Planet II , coupled with Attenborough's involvement, was a shock to everyone! \nTaking the project with his usual grandfatherly grace, Attenborough can't wait to tour the oceans one more time: \n“I am truly thrilled to be joining this new exploration of the underwater worlds which cover most of our planet, yet are still its least known.” \nThe national treasure and avid naturalist has become synonymous with the BBC's nature documentaries, joining the corporation in 1952 and expressing his love for our planet ever since. After starting in radio, Attenborough came to the fore of the BBC's TV thanks to his 1979 series Life on Earth . Since then, he has taken us on many a globe-trotting expedition with the likes of Living With Dinosaurs , Galapagos 3D , and The Blue Planet . \nFor those worrying that Blue Planet II is just a show for the Brits, fear not. Made in conjunction with BBC America, the German broadcaster WDR and France Télévisions, Blue Planet II is a group effort and will be syndicated around the world. \nSee also: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:08:18.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
