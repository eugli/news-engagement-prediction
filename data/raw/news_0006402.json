Robinson was long considered a Florida lean, but on Monday it was reported that Robinson wasn’t a take for Florida due to a decision by the UF administration – and that he wouldn’t be announcing his decision on television Wednesday as planned.\nRobinson was cited for marijuana possession on Jan. 21 during his official visit to Ohio State. However, after UF did its research on Robinson, the school made the call to allow Robinson to join the class, per McElwain.\n“Obviously, as in all players, the important thing is you do your research and your background,” McElwain said. “My guess is there's a few people in this crowd right here that have some regrets on things they've done, and yet at the same time take responsibility for it. Here is the good thing: We get an opportunity to be involved in his life. We get an opportunity to help him move forward, as we do all the players on this team. I'm excited about him being a Gator.”\nCLICK THE BANNER FOR ALL THE LATEST FROM SIGNING DAY\n* Video Analysis: Florida adds Robinson\n* Signing Day Central\n* GET TWO FREE MONTHS OF INSIDE THE GATORS\n* Looks like Florida will finish 9th in recruiting rankings\n* Add another four-star as Florida lands Lemons\n* Is this Florida's best ever South Florida signing class?\n* Florida picks up third four-star of the day in Edwards", "external_links": ["https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/oxbwxbnrgsjidnoyvddn)", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/oxbwxbnrgsjidnoyvddn", "https://twitter.com/CoachMcElwain/status/826888894301999104", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/pld2gugqwng2pu8nbwk9", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/pld2gugqwng2pu8nbwk9)"], "published": "2017-02-01T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T17:52:22.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
