The new rules outlined in the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memos make it easier for border patrol and immigration officers to quickly deport any illegal immigrants (or \"removable aliens\") they find, with only a few exceptions, principally children. \n\n2. Indian-Americans, who as per an unofficial count make up nearly 300,000 illegal \"aliens\", are likely to be greatly impacted by this. \n\n3. Even those immigrants awaiting a court decision on their status - like asylum applicants - will be detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. However, Mexican immigrants without proper documentation will be immediately deported. \n\n4. Any immigrant who is in the country illegally and is charged or convicted of any offense, or even suspected of a crime, will now be an enforcement priority. \n\n5. This is different from the earlier policy in that now, even those convicted of minor offenses - like shoplifting or running a red light - will be targeted. Former US President Barack Obama 's administration, deemed such people as low priority for deportation. For instance, now, if an immigrant is overstaying her visa, she is more likely to be deported, unlike before. \n\n6. The new rules will subject immigrants who cannot show they have been in the country for more than two years to \"expedited removal.\" \n\n7. It also details immediate orders on building a wall along the nearly 2,000-mile US-Mexico border. \n\n8. US Homeland Security even plans to send to Mexico non-Mexican migrants who arrived in the US via that country. \n\n9. While the plans consider almost all illegal immigrants subject to deportation, they will leave protections in place for immigrants known as \"dreamers\", children who were brought into the US illegally by their parents. \n\n10. The memos call for the hiring of 10,000 more US Immigration and Customs agents and 5,000 more US Customs and Border Protection agents, and building new detention facilities to effectively enforce the new immigration plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:15:18.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
