Alt-right website Breitbart decried the commercial in an article titled \"Why Coca-Cola's Multicultural 'America the Beautiful' Ad Was Offensive.\"\nNow, the ad's revival in an even more divisive political climate has sparked controversy once again, as users on Twitter were quick to offer their complaints about Coca-Cola's political stance:\n@CocaCola, why do you run a commercial on an @NFL game,singing \"America the beautiful\" in 5 languages? We SPEAK American English in the USA!\n@CocaCola This is America, we speak English. Embarrassed I've bought your product for 30+ years #MAGA\nYou don't rewrite America the Beautiful unless you're a leftist organization eager to push some false narratives. Coca-Cola #Coke #SuperBowl\nOf course, for all the complaints, many were just as quick to praise Coca-Cola's inclusivity:\n? the #CocaCola 'America the Beautiful' commercial, the song in diff languages represents what America is all about! #SuperBowl @CocaCola https://t.co/emQCNEuJvc\nTo those criticizing Coca Cola's \"America the Beautiful:\" USA is multicultural &amp; has no set language. Be kind. Enjoy ur football. #SuperBowl\nThe #CocaCola commercial where they sing America, the Beautiful in different languages is my favorite commercial of all time.\nWith the advertisement's revival, Coca-Cola joins other high-profile companies in taking a stance against Trump's executive order by celebrating America's diversity, including Budweiser and Google .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Brandon_Judah/status/828386395953754112&quot;", "https://twitter.com/IamAlexRafael/status/828386900004175873", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQn5wiDyUHo", "https://twitter.com/Brandon_Judah/status/828386395953754112", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtBZvl7dIu4", "https://twitter.com/newlight116/status/828392535328452608", "https://twitter.com/IamAlexRafael/status/828386900004175873&quot;", "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-coca-cola-super-bowl-ad-stirs-controversy-20140203-story.html", "https://twitter.com/JuliaFortney/status/828391491156529152&quot;", "https://twitter.com/kohljm/status/828391665786351616", "https://twitter.com/newlight116/status/828392535328452608&quot;", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/02/02/why-coca-cola-america-the-beautiful-ad-was-offensive/", "http://time.com/3773/coca-colas-its-beautiful-super-bowl-ad-brings-out-some-ugly-americans/", "https://twitter.com/rogercarroll8/status/828406376091283457&quot;", "https://t.co/emQCNEuJvc", "https://twitter.com/CocaCola/status/828385708926705665&quot;", "https://twitter.com/JuliaFortney/status/828391491156529152", "https://t.co/z65LimssjD", "https://twitter.com/CocaCola/status/828385708926705665", "https://twitter.com/kohljm/status/828391665786351616&quot;", "https://twitter.com/VegasforTrump/status/813236119961673728", "https://twitter.com/rogercarroll8/status/828406376091283457", "https://twitter.com/VegasforTrump/status/813236119961673728&quot;"], "published": "2017-02-06T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T15:58:02.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
