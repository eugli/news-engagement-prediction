I did whatever I could to make him welcome, but is seems like the little jerk is a turncoat.” \nIt follows Price’s claims last night that the pair had had a huge blow-up over Laws’‘50 Years on Radio’ commemorations. \n“We had to say what we thought of John. What always struck me about John Laws is that he has very weird hair looks like it’s green and fake. Next day I am sat in my office and he gets off air and comes in. ‘You bleep-bleep-bleep! You ever do that to me again and I’ll bleep smash you!’” the 62-year-old recalled. \nBut Laws has denied it ever happened, before taking a cheap shot at his rival’s height. \n“No I don’t remember the moment. And I don’t believe it happened, to be honest,” he told the radio hosts firmly. \n“You can’t worry about that. It’s called Small Man Syndrome — poor little Pricey. As I said, I did my best to give him a hand up to be kind to him, but obviously that didn’t work. Let me say again, that is Small Man Syndrome. He’s very small. Well, vertically very small.” \nAccording to Price, the feud ignited back in 2003 during an Anthony Mundine boxing match at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, after Price found out executives at then-employer 2UE had moved him from the high-profile breakfast radio shift to drive in the afternoons. \n“So I go to the fight and I’m sitting there thinking no one else knows, I’m thinking to myself right, this is going to get public tomorrow so at least I’ve got tonight to enjoy,” he said. \n“Next minute around the ring walks John Laws, who was in mornings. He comes over and hugs me. I’m thinking, ‘that is very weird, John Laws doesn’t even like me’ then all of the cameras appeared from everywhere so someone had leaked it between when I got told and when I got to the fight which was pretty ordinary.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:18:56.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
