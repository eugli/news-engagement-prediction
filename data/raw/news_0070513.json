According to KXAN , the cedar pollen count on December 29, 2016 was the second highest in recorded history. Abundant rain earlier in the year helped produce a bumper crop of malicious pollen. \nThe source of the seasonal scourge known as cedar fever is actually the Ashe juniper ( Juniperus ashei ). Though technically not a cedar tree, it’s also referred to as Mountain Cedar. When? \nThe trees typically produce large quantities of pollen from January to February, but sometimes the season can last until March 1. However, the day-to-day weather can significantly affect the amount of pollen in the air. On cool, sunny and windy days, the pollen is sometimes so abundant that it looks like smoke. The fire department routinely deals with false alarms, particularly in cedar-rich west Austin, during the season. Flu-like Symptoms \nEven people who don’t normally have allergies can be affected by the Ashe juniper pollen. \ncontinue reading below our video Long-Haul Flight Survival Tips The microscopic pollen grain is shaped like a spiked mace, which means it produces irritation from contact alone, in addition to allergic inflammation. Symptoms can include extreme fatigue, headaches, stuffy head and itchy eyes. \nNewcomers to Austin sometimes have a honeymoon period of about two years without any symptoms at all. That’s why it often comes as a shock when previously allergy-free people are slammed unexpectedly in their third year in central Texas. OTC Treatments \nIn 2015, Flonase became available as an over-the-counter treatment . A year earlier, a similar product, Nasonex, was approved for over-the-counter sales. These are both corticosteroid nose sprays. They are generally considered the “big guns” of cedar fever treatment, but consult your doctor before using them. They do have side effects. Some people get severe back and neck aches after stopping corticosteroid nose sprays. Allegra, Claritin, Sudafed and their generic counterparts may provide some relief, but they are often not formidable enough for this foe. Other Treatments \nIf you don’t mind a few needles in the face, acupuncture may provide short-term relief. Those with less severe symptoms may be helped by saline nasal sprays and neti pots, which physically wash out the pollen. Has it Always Been this Bad? \nAlthough Ashe juniper trees are native to central Texas, they were once few and far between. Naturally occurring wildfires and grazing wildlife used to keep the trees in check. Now they grow in thick stands on any untended hillside. The greenbelts in and around Austin are covered in them. Can We Just Kill Cedar? \nSome landowners have become downright obsessed with eradicating cedar. In fact, under the right conditions, getting rid of cedar can help conserve water . The tree does provide habitat for birds and other animals, so killing all of it would have negative effects on the ecosystem. The biggest problem is that it starts coming back not long after you kill it. Like it or not, the Ashe juniper is a survivor, and it will probably outlive all of us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:50:53.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
