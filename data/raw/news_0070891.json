The 51-year-old’s court-based campaign to ensure the government could not activate Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins the Brexit process, without the permission of MPs was a success – even though controversial , taxpayer-funded leaflets advocating a Remain vote distributed during the campaign promised voters “This is your decision. The government will implement what you decide.”\nNevertheless, the government has now successfully passed legislation on the matter through the elected House of Commons, despite the determined resistance of a few holdouts .\nThe only obstacle to Article 50 authorisation now is the House of Lords. As in the Commons, the balance of opinion in the Lords is strongly in favour of the EU – but, unlike the Commons, the Lords are not elected and are therefore more liable to defy the will of the electors .\nTo encourage them and others to do so, Miller has launched campaign2018.org , telling the Evening Standard that, “In the face of no opposition, whoever feels the need to be the voice of reason needs to speak up now.”\n“Currently MPs are too weak to do that,” Miller says, “so we must do it for them. If it doesn’t work, then we will try again with the Great Repeal Bill or try and get emergency legislation.”\nWake up. We do not have to do this. We can stop this madness through a vote in Parliament.
