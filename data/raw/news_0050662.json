This map from the Institute de Radioprotection et de Süreté Nucléaire shows where the particles have been detected \nThese radioactive particles are produced by atomic bomb explosions or nuclear disasters such as Chernobyl or Fukushima. \nThey appear to be emanating from Eastern Europe, but experts have not been able to say exactly what produced them. \nAstrid Liland, head of emergency preparedness at the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority, told the Barents Observer that the health risk was very low – which was why she did not raise the alarm after detecting Iodine-131 during the second week of January. The Iodine-131 may have leaked from nuclear reactors or medical facilities Related Stories RAY OF FRIGHT Alien rays from outer space could be making your iPhone freeze and may spark computer CHAOS HAPPY MONDAY!

So were the measurements made in neighbouring countries, like Finland. The levels raise no concern for humans or the environment. Therefore, we believe this had no news value.” \nHowever, she was unable to say where the particles have come from. \nThey may have been released by accident by a nuclear reactor or a medical facility where they are being used to treat hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. \nThe particles could also been produced by Russian nuclear submarines. \nScientists detected the highest number of particles in Poland, although still not enough to spark a public health emergency. \nWe pay for your stories!
