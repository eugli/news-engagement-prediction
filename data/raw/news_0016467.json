(Photo: U.S. Courts Handout, EPA) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe legal battle over President Trump's temporary travel ban targeting seven majority-Muslim countries likely will take weeks to resolve and could require the Supreme Court to make the final decision. But the arguments challenging and defending the executive order have become clear. \nThe Justice Department argues that a president has broad powers to act unilaterally on questions of immigration and national security. It says judges have limited powers to second-guess such decisions and are urging the court to allow Trump's immigration order to go back into effect. \nOpponents concede that a president has some power on his own, but they say Trump overstepped by banning people from specific countries and those who follow a specific religion. They contend he violated core principles of the Constitution and ignored laws passed by Congress. \nTrump's order, signed Jan. 27 at the Pentagon, instituted a 120-day ban on refugees entering the U.S. and a 90-day ban for most citizens of Libya, Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The order also indefinitely barred any Syrians from entering the U.S. He said his goal was to improve background checks to make sure terrorists are not admitted inadvertently. \nThe order was blocked by U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle on Friday and is currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, based in San Francisco. A three-judge panel of that court could decide as early as Monday night whether to maintain Robart's order or allow the ban to go back into effect. Experts question legality of Trump's immigration ban on Muslim countries Government's argument \nThe Justice Department's pitch, first made early Sunday morning at the district court level in Washington state, is that Trump has both constitutional and legal authority in matters of national security dating back at least to 1952. \nJustice Department lawyers cite passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act under President Harry Truman, which gave the president the power to suspend or impose restrictions on the entry of foreign nationals if he determines their entry \"would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\" \nAnd to back up their claim, they list eight instances dating back to President Ronald Reagan in 1986 when presidents blocked residents of certain nations — such as Cuba, Libya, Russia, Somalia and Yemen — from being granted admission to the U.S. \nRobart’s nationwide order, they argue, \"second-guesses the president’s national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of aliens and the best means of minimizing that risk.\" \nIn addition to that statutory authority, the Justice Department claims that persons seeking admission to the U.S. for the first time have \"no constitutional rights\" to surmount the nation’s \"sovereign prerogative\" to exclude them. \nBeyond the constitutional and legal arguments, the administration also maintains that states such as Washington, Minnesota and Hawaii lack standing to bring their challenge because — unlike would-be immigrants and refugees — they are not subject to the travel ban. \nHaving claimed authority and questioned the states’ arguments, government lawyers also criticize Robart’s ruling as \"vastly overbroad\" because it applies nationwide, even though a federal judge in Massachusetts upheld the executive order in a separate, more limited case. \nPresident Trump speaks to members of military during his first visit to the headquarters of the U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., on Feb. 6, 2017. (Photo: Borchuck, James, AP) Ban opponents' argument \nThe challenge to Trump's order is being led by the attorneys general from Washington state and Minnesota, with help from arguments filed by a broad ranges of groups, including 16 other states and the District of Columbia, two former secretaries of State, three former CIA directors, 97 tech companies and 284 law professors. \nIn a joint filing, the attorneys general concede that the 1952 law does give broad powers to a president to enforce immigration laws in the U.S. But they say Trump's executive order goes far beyond the legal limitations originally enshrined in the Constitution and later enacted by Congress. \nThey say the 1952 powers given to a president were limited by a 1965 law that prohibits discrimination against immigrants based on their country of origin. They say Trump's national security arguments are undercut because no one from the countries listed in the travel ban have committed terrorist acts on U.S. soil. \n\"Though (the order) cites the attacks of September 11, 2001, as a rationale, it imposes no restrictions on people from the countries whose nationals carried out those attacks,\" they say in court papers. \nEven though the White House has repeatedly said the order does not constitute a \"Muslim ban,\" the attorneys general argue that his repeated call for such a ban on the campaign trail shows the true intent of his order. \nThat allegation is bolstered, they say, by the fact that Trump's order includes a section giving immigration preference to people who practice a \"minority religion\" and fear \"religious-based persecution\" in their countries. The seven countries listed in Trump's ban are 97% Muslim. \n\"The sham of a secular purpose is exposed both by the language of the order and defendants’ expressions of anti-Muslim intent,\" they maintain. \nAnd they argue that Trump's order violates due process rights established under the Fifth Amendment. While the administration has said foreigners have few rights to force their way into the country, the attorneys general say longtime, legal residents of the U.S. — those who were detained at U.S. airports or stranded abroad by Trump's order — have every right to do so. \n\"A temporary absence from the country does not deprive longtime residents of their right to due process,\" they say.
