Advertisement \nHe has another GOP bona fide: His mother, Anne Gorsuch, was the Environmental Protection Agency administrator under President Ronald Reagan. \nTrump staged his Supreme Court nomination with a heavy dose of showmanship, drawing comparisons to his former TV show, “Celebrity Apprentice.’’ Gorsuch and the other finalist, Thomas M. Hardiman, a Third Circuit appeals judge from Pittsburgh, were summoned to Washington as suspense built over the selection. \n“Was that a surprise? Was it?’’ Trump said as he made the announcement. \nEven though Republicans are in the majority in the Senate, Gorsuch’s confirmation is not assured. Trump tossed the name into a Capitol Hill atmosphere that is growing more contentious by the day, with battles intensifying over some of Trump’s Cabinet nominees. \nSeveral Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey of Massachusetts, immediately voiced opposition. Minority leader Charles Schumer said he has ‘‘serious doubts’’ that Gorsuch is within what Democrats consider the legal mainstream. \n“As a judge, he has twisted himself into a pretzel to make sure the rules favor giant companies over workers and individual Americans,’’ Warren said. Big business “spent millions to keep this seat open, and Judge Gorsuch is their reward.’’ \nMarkey, meanwhile, said “Gorsuch has authored or joined opinions that have demonstrated hostility to women’s reproductive rights, common-sense environmental regulations, and the rights of workers, consumers, and the disabled.’’ \n“I will not support the nomination of Judge Gorsuch,’’ Markey said. \nDemocrats are still seething over Republicans’ 10-month refusal to even hold a hearing on Merrick Garland, Obama’s choice to replace Scalia. \nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell appealed to Democrats Tuesday to repeat the support they gave Gorsuch in 2006, when he sailed onto the Court of Appeals in an unanimous confirmation. \n“I hope members of the Senate will again show him fair consideration and respect the result of the recent election with an up-or-down vote on his nomination,’’ McConnell said. \nBut the combative start of Trump’s presidency, and particularly the explosive executive order temporarily banning refugees from immigrating he signed Friday, sparked a new level of partisan warfare. Democrats also face intensifying pressure from their base, fired up and protesting Trump almost daily, which is agitating for all-out opposition against Trump. \nThe controversies over Trump’s immigration restrictions, in particular, resonate strongly over the Supreme Court showdown because they raise fundamental questions about constitutional rights and liberties. Trump targeted immigrants for scorn during his campaign, and his crackdowns on those specific populations now appear central to his plan for governing. \nDraft executive orders indicate Trump also is considering blocking legal immigrants if they have a high risk of needing social services like food stamps, according to the Washington Post. The White House also is considering ways of deporting legal immigrants who are dependent on such services, the Post reported Tuesday. \nSingling out specific populations for such punitive actions based on their country of origin or socioeconomic status could run afoul of constitutional protections, however. If Trump moves forward with those ideas, it undoubtedly will add to the Trump-related federal court caseload that is growing fast and raising questions that may wind up before the Supreme Court. \nWith the stakes — and tensions — so high, Democrats may choose to exercise a filibuster, which would mean the court nominee would require 60 votes, including at least eight Democrats, to confirm the pick. While invoking a filibuster could threaten the nomination, using that strategy also carries a risk that McConnell would seek to change Senate rules and eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. \nSuch a move would allow Republicans to win a confirmation vote with a simple majority, taking away Democrats’ leverage for Supreme Court nominees in the future. \nAt least one Democratic senator, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, has said he will filibuster any Supreme Court candidate Trump puts forth other than Garland. But most Democrats said that they would consider Trump’s pick on his merits. \nTrump’s early actions have “created a very tense environment between Democrats in Congress and the White House. I think these executive orders have really pushed to the limit the relationship between us,” said Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois. “It’s hard to believe this is day 12 of the Trump presidency.” Still, he said that Democrats should take a look at Trump’s nominee, “talk about them, and decide a course forward together.” \nSenate Democrats Tuesday banded together to temporarily hold up high-profile Cabinet selections. Twelve Democrats on the traditionally bipartisan Finance Committee boycotted a scheduled committee vote on two of Trump’s nominees, Representative Tom Price of Georgia to be health secretary and financier Steven Mnuchin to be treasury secretary. The Democrats said news reports showed both Price and Mnuchin lied to the committee during their confirmation hearings, and the senators said they would refuse to vote until they got more information from the candidates. Committee rules require at least one Democrat to be present to hold a vote. \nDemocrats ‘‘ought to stop posturing and acting like idiots,” fumed chairman Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican. \nThe Senate’s deliberations over Senator Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican and early Trump supporter, to be attorney general, became more tense Tuesday after Trump on Monday night fired acting attorney general Sally Yates. Yates, an Obama administration holdover, had defied Trump by refusing to defend the executive order banning immigrants from the seven countries. \nAttacking the immigration order and praising Yates for having a “steel spine to stand up and say no,” the Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein of California, announced that she would vote against Sessions because she had “no confidence” that he would show similar independence in the job. \n“He has been the fiercest, most dedicated, and most loyal promoter in Congress of the Trump agenda,” she said during a scathing speech at a committee meeting Tuesday. The panel was slated to vote on Sessions’s nomination Tuesday morning, but Democrats’s effectively filibustered by delivering long speeches of opposition against Sessions and forced the GOP chairman to delay the vote until Wednesday. \nRepublicans accused their colleagues across the aisle of pitching a hissy fit. \n“It is time [Democrats] get over the fact that they lost the election,” said McConnell, accusing the Democrats of deliberately causing chaos and delay for political reasons. “None of this is going to lead to a different outcome.” Related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T09:09:30.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
