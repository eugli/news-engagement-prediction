Shannon Matthews (Photo: PA) \nFans said Sheridan Smith was \"amazing\" in her role as Karen's friend Julie Bushby - who stood by her throughout the trial - while Gemma Whelan starred as the mum herself. Read More \nShannon - now 18 years old - was taken into care after the trial, and now lives with a new family after being given a new identity. \nHere is what has happened to the real people following the hunt that inspired The Moorside drama. Karen Matthews \nShannon's mum Karen - who still protests her innocence - was released from jail in 2012 after serving half of her eight-year sentence. \nAlthough she left with a fresh hairstyle, she was discovered by the media and later changed her identity to avoid the public eye. Karen Matthews during the 2008 'search' for Shannon (Photo: Nigel Bennett) \nShe has since told how she fears for her life following The Moorside airing . \n“I cannot go out of the door. I’m frightened out of my life. I’m shaking like a leaf. I’m s*** scared to even get any ­shopping or anything,\" she told a pal. \n\"I know I can’t stop it but why does it have to be dragged up again? Why don’t they just leave me alone and let me get on with my life?\" Karen was recently seen heading to a charity shop where she spent 3 hours working (Photo: Phil Harris/Daily Mirror) She has changed her look (Photo: Phil Harris/Daily Mirror) \nBelieved to be heading to work at a charity shop, the 41-year-old was seen wearing a black puffer jacket and pink gloves. \nShe wore her dark hair down and loose as she headed towards her place of work. Julie Bushby \nPlayed by Sheridan Smith in the series, Julie led the search for Shannon after her 'disappearance'.

She wanted to find out the truth (Photo: Rex Features) \n“I just wanted the truth,” said Julie. “She kept saying other people were involved, I wanted the truth, to know who, why, what.” \nAfter Karen was released from prison, her contact with Julie stopped as the terms of her release meant she was unable to communicate with her. Natalie Murray \nNatalie Murray was another of Karen's friends who helped her in the search for Shannon. \nShe is now a stay-at-home mum and left Dewsbury in 2009. Natalie Brown saw the signs (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nAppearing on TV ahead of the drama's airing, she revealed she will never be able to forgive Karen. \n“It started when she did the very first interview outside her house,” recalled Natalie. \n“I was there when the family liaison officer told her not to do the interview or speak to the press until they had as much information as they could get, and then they’d deal with that side of the press. It was due to previous cases when a child has gone missing and it could put their life at risk. But Karen did the interview. \n\"To me, as a mum, why would you do that when you’ve been told it could put a child’s life at risk?” She recently appeared on TV with Julie Bushby (Photo: Rex Features) \nNatalie said she “went straight down and asked her” why she did it, and claimed Karen’s answer was “everybody told me” to do it. \n“[I felt] angry that nobody listened to me or saw what I was seeing about her behaviour or things like that,” added Natalie. Craig Meehan \nCraig Meehan was Karen 's boyfriend at the time - and his uncle Michael Donovan was found to have planned Shannon's disappearance to generate money from the publicity and search.

Craig was recently seen just two miles from where Shannon was found (Photo: The People) \nOver the weekend, the Sunday People revealed how he was seen just two miles from where Shannon was found, he bought groceries and a case of lager, picked up Lotto scratchcards from a newsagent then headed into a bookmaker’s. \nThe ex-fishmonger, now 30 and with a new name, is portrayed in the film but had no part in the fake abduction. Michael Donovan Michael Donovan was sentenced to eight years but was released early (Photo: PA) \nMichael was found guilty of kidnapping, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice for his role in the stunt. \nAlong with Karen, he was sentenced to eight years in prison - and by the time she was released after serving half the sentence, Donovan had already been released. \nHe hasn't been pictured since his release from prison.
