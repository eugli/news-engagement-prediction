Her outing comes after the star drastically changed her look after dropping from a size 26 to a sim-line size six. Turning heads: The Shameless star appeared to be in high spirits as she relaxed poolside In high spirits: The actress appeared to be having a whale of a time as she soaked up the sun The actress openly criticized her previously heavy weight earlier this month by claiming you cannot be 'morbidly obese and happy'. Appearing on ITV show This Morning to discuss the issue of weight, she admitted that she is now happy now because of her slim figure - while fellow guest Chantelle Houghton disagreed as she would rather just 'enjoy' her life at whatever size. The 5'1 star has dropped a whopping ten dress sizes after having a gastric band fitted in 2010, and owes her happiness to her trim and toned figure. Embarking on a debate on the morning chat show, Tina admitted: 'I'm slim and happy. I don't believe you can be clinically, morbidly obese, and be happy. If you're ill, you're not happy.' Just hanging out: She seemed utterly zen as she dipped her feet in the pool Feeling pensive? Tina showcased her slim figure in the printed bustier bikini top and a pleated skirt-style sarong Going casual: She scraped her blonde hair back into a tousled ponytail Before adding: 'You can’t say you’re enormous and really happy about it.’ After losing so much weight, Tina then went on to spend £50,000 to remove her excess skin in 2015 in order to maintain her new found confidence in herself - despite her husband Paul's carefree attitude to her size. She continued: ‘I’m at a Liverpool lipo surgery getting the last bit of skin done.’ ‘But my husband’s happy if I’m fat or thin. I was clinically and morbidly obese. I was dying.’ Shady lady: The mother-of-two shielded her face behind black square-frame shades Always polished: The former Brookside star didn't let a poolside setting stop her getting her nails done Soaking up the sun: She lay on her back as she topped up her tan As a result of her newfound body confidence, she recently admitted she would love to bare all for Playboy magazine - which could be a tough request as nude models no longer appearing in the publication. She told Closer : 'If Playboy rang offering me £250,000 to do a naked shoot, of course I would do it! 'Women should celebrate their bodies, and after years of having such a s**t one, it's time I showed off how phenomenal I look!' Meanwhile, Tina - whose glitzy marriage ceremony was spectacular enough to win Celebrity Four Weddings - is planning to renew her vows with husband Paul Chase, 33.

Showing off her slimmed-down frame, the actress slipped into an array of gowns, each one more stunning than the last. Tina and Paul tied the knot in 2010, and the couple were crowned the winners of Celebrity Four Weddings after going up against Debbie McGee, Big Brother three contestant Spencer Smith and glamour model Linsey Dawn McKenzie.
