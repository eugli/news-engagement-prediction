The slogan came from the final episode of the sixth season. \n'WALKING DEAD' ACTOR TALKS ZOMBIE SURVIVAL \nSheffield News reported that shopper Ian Lucraft was so offended by the “explicit” t-shirt that he directly complained to the UK-based discount clothing store’s Chief Executive Paul Marchant. \n“We were shocked when we came face to face with a new t-shirt with a racially explicit graphic and text,” explained the Methodist minister. “It was fantastically offensive and I can only assume that no one in this process of ordering it knew what they were doing or were aware of its subliminal messages.” \n“The slogan is ‘Eeny meenie miny moe…’ It stops there, but of course we all know what the original said: ‘catch a n by his toe,’” added Lucraft. \n'WALKING DEAD' PRODUCERS, CAST TALK SHOCKING SEASON 7 PREMIERE \nLudcraft also stated he asked the salesperson at the checkout if other people had questioned the shirt, but learned that she reportedly didn’t see it as it was new stock. However, when he informed her of his reasoning, “she too was horrified.” \n“The graphic has a large American baseball bat, wrapped round with barbed wire, and covered with blood. This image relates directly to the practice of assaulting black people in America,\" said Ludcraft. \"It is directly threatening of a racist assault, and if I were black and were faced by a wearer I would know just where I stood.” \nIn the famous scene, Negan used the word “tiger,\" as opposed to the N-word. \n'WALKING DEAD' RATINGS ARE LOWER THAN EVER: IS NEGAN TO BLAME? \nA spokesman for Primark said that the questionable garment has been withdrawn and added: “The t-shirt in question is licensed merchandise for the U.S. television series, ‘The Walking Dead’, and the quote and image are taken directly from the show. Any offense caused by its design was wholly unintentional and Primark sincerely apologizes for this. Primark is currently removing the product from sale.” \nSheffield News also revealed that the popular children’s counting rhyme has existed in various forms since well before 1820.
