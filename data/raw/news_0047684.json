Gemma and Noddy Naiken balance their 30th cup of chili at the 8th annual Orlando Chili Cook-Off Saturday at Orlando Festival Park. (Caitlin Dineen / Orlando Sentinel) Caitlin Dineen Privacy Policy \nThe tower of 29 empty chili cups Gemma and Noddy Naiken balanced in their left hands Saturday afternoon were a dead giveaway the couple knew what they were doing. \nIt was the unseen contents of the backpack slung over Noddy Naiken’s shoulder that edged them toward chili-eating greatness. \n“I’ve got my little backpack here, where I’ve got a full bottle of Pepto [Bismol],” he said with a laugh, rattling off other medicinal products he stocked, should things take a turn for the worst, digestively speaking. \nThis was the fourth time the Lake Nona couple attended the Orlando Chili Cook-Off. The event, organized by Orlando Weekly, was in its eighth year as it took place at Festival Park Saturday. \nFunds raised from Saturday’s event went to the Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation for Childhood Cancer. \nEnthusiasts had access to nearly 100 different types of chili, created by competitors from as far away as Texas, said Graham Jarrett, the weekly’s publisher. About 15,000 people were expected to attend. \n“There’s so many people that have their chili recipe [that] they think is so much better than everybody’s chili recipe,” Jarrett said. \nSaturday showcased a mix of individual competitors, business groups and even offerings from local restaurants such as Sonny’s BBQ and Tony Roma’s Steakhouse Restaurant. They all vied to win one of two titles: people’s choice or judge’s choice. \nBeyond local chili fame and bragging rights, Jarrett said the cook off was a sanctioned event with Chili Appreciation Society International, meaning if a team placed in Saturday’s competition, they would earn points that could help them qualify for the International Chili Cook Off. \n“We’re an important stop on the chili circuit,” said Jarrett. \nJustin Bliss, owner of Clermont-based Culinary Bliss, chose the cook-off as his first competition because he had a chili recipe he spent years perfecting. \nBliss, like every other competitor, wouldn’t reveal the secret ingredients he uses, but he thought his use of lamb might set him apart from his challengers. He also thought his attention to detail in the final presentation would help too. \n“We try to make it visually stimulating so everybody loves it before they even try it,” Bliss said. He topped his chili with fresh-chopped parsley and parmesan cheese. \nIn addition to learning the ropes of cooking competitions, Bliss said he wanted to support Alex’s Lemonade Stand. Bliss’s girlfriend, Nevane Zimmerman, was a survivor of childhood cancer herself, defeating Acute lymphoblastic leukemia. \nSaturday also featured the World Chili Eating Competition, highlighting professional competitive eaters Joey Chestnut, Miki Sudo, Carmen Cincotti, Geoffrey Esper, Gideon Oji, Badlands Booker and Nate Biller. \nChestnut, commonly known for his participation in the annual Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, successfully defended his title by eating slightly more than two gallons of chili in five minutes. \nMore casual chili eaters, like the Naikens, did not anticipate eating that much. They expected to eat less than a gallon between the two of them over the course of the day. \nBut they did have a strategy. \n“You don’t eat breakfast because you’re not going to make it through if you eat breakfast,” Gemma Naiken said. \ncdineen@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5414; On Twitter: @CaitlinDineen Caption Universal Orlando announces Mardi Gras concert lineup \nUniversal Studios has announced the 12 acts scheduled to perform at this 2017's Mardi Gras event, which kicks off February 4th and runs through March 25th. \nUniversal Studios has announced the 12 acts scheduled to perform at this 2017's Mardi Gras event, which kicks off February 4th and runs through March 25th.
