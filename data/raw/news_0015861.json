Sure, some days the AP tackles viral stories, such as the man who lost his testicles in an explosion while trying to make a scuba bong, but most are political in nature and focus on the Trump White House. \nSurprisingly, President Trump came out on top in an AP fact-check Monday , which found that Judge James Robart’s claim that no foreign nationals from the seven majority-Muslim nations named in Trump’s executive order had been arrested since 9/11 was incorrect, and that the president therefore had “no support” for his travel ban. AP FACT CHECK: Judge wrong in saying no Muslims from 7 targeted #travelban nations arrested in US since 9/11. https://t.co/ItqedUJCcq @AP \n— David Beard (@dabeard) February 6, 2017 Oops. Turns out there have been dozens of terror-related convictions–not just arrests–from the 7 countries. https://t.co/QPnK8pepGH \n— Byron York (@ByronYork) February 6, 2017 \nThe Washington Examiner’s Byron York also corrected the judge in a piece Monday. \nLast summer, [the Justice Department provided] the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest … with a list of 580 people who were convicted — not just arrested, but tried and convicted — of terror-related offenses between Sept. 11, 2001 and Dec. 31, 2014. \nThe subcommittee investigated further and found that at least 380 of the 580 were foreign-born and that an additional 129 were of unknown origin. Of the 380, there were representatives — at least 60 — from all of the countries on the Trump executive order list. And with 129 unknowns, there might be more, as well. \nThat’s quite a few more than “none, as best I can tell.” @ByronYork @dcexaminer But what about what all those memes say?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:49:25.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
