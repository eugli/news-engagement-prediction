Divine Grace Medical Center in General Trias is one of the hospitals where victims of the Cavite EPZA fire are confined. Photo by Jeff Digma/Rappler CAVITE, Philippines – The number of workers injured from the fire that hit the House Technology Industries (HTI) building at the Cavite Export Processing Zone has climbed to 126, with 6 of them in critical condition. \nIn a press conference Friday, February 3, Cavite Governor Jesus Crispin Remulla also announced that, according to records from the human resources department of HTI, only 3 workers are unaccounted for – down from 20 the night before. \nHe said two of those in critical condition are in the intensive care unit of a local hospital. \nThe governor corrected an early advisory about a fatality. \"Ibang tao pala ang namatay sa hospital. It was a mistake because we have limited information.\" (The person who died at the hospital was not a fire victim. It was a mistake since information relayed to us was limited.) \nHe said these numbers may rise once investigators are able to penetrate building premises. (READ: LIST: Workers injured in Cavite export processing zone fire ) \nMore than 30 hours after the fire was put under control, smoke still comes out out the facility, which sits on 6 hectares of the export processing zone. \nRemulla said that they are yet to declare a total \"fire out.\" \"Given our estimates, it's about 95-98% fire out. Most likely today.\" \nInitial findings attribute the cause of fire to mechanical accident. According to Bureau of Fire Protection chief Bobby Baruelo, the building houses combustible materials, causing an immediate spreading of the fire. \nAuthorities estimate the cost of damage at P12 billion to P15 billion. \nMore than 10,000 jobless \nIt is unknown when employees will be called for work, but Remulla gave assurances that necessary adjustments will be made by the company. \n\"Those who are in need will be helped. We will try to help with our limited resources in the province. And the company is committed to help all of them,\" he said. \nHe said that HTI will make necessary adjustments for those who are currently jobless. \"In 3 months' time, baka maibalik na (they might be called to work again),\" he said. \nThe HTI facility, where housing materials for export to Japan are manufactured, occupies 80 hectares in the Cavite Export Processing Zone – only 6 hectares of which caught fire. It is the biggest employer in the processing zone, with about 15,000 employees. \nThis is not the first time an HTI structure caught fire. According to the fire chief, a warehouse owned by the Japanese firm burned down in 2012. There were no casualties. \n'Our budget can manage' \nIn a text message sent to Rappler Friday morning, Remulla said that the provincial government will no longer declare a state of calamity. \"We can manage,\" he said. \nThis comes after a meeting with the provincial board Thursday evening on whether they should declare a state of calamity to make way for faster clearing operations. \nRemulla said \"we can assist with our [emergency] budget\" of P7 million to 10 million. \nThe labor and social welfare departments, as well as the provincial government, have pledged assistance to the victims . \nCompanies within export zones are under the authority of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority, not the local governments. – Rappler.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:55:03.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
