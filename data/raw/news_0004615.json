contract with French rugby February 2, 2017 7:04am Barba accepts 2.5 year deal 00:15:33 \nBarba accepts 2.5 year deal 02 Feb 2017 5 hours /video/video.news.com.au/sourceId/606562/ BEN Barba says he was forced to sign a multimillion-dollar deal with French Rugby Union club Toulon due to his crippling financial situation while serving his NRL drugs ban. \nBarba released a statement via his management on Thursday morning claiming he linked with Toulon because he has been unemployed since October. \nUnder the rules of his 12-match suspension for illicit drug use, the former Dally M winner can’t play a rival code. \nBarba had originally hoped to continue his career in the NRL by playing for Toulon while serving his suspension. \nHowever, the NRL’s refusal to register his contract until his return from Toulon meant Barba was left to make a financial decision. \nIt’s why the fullback has signed a $2.5 million dollar deal with Toulon for the next two and a half years. \n“The fact is I am a father of four little girls and like other fathers I am the primary income earner for my family,” Barba said. \n“Since October, I have been unemployed and I have financial commitments like any other father, I am a professional athlete with a set of skills which I can’t earn a living from in this country and I needed a job. \n“It was advised that my contract with the Sharks was not going to be registered until just before round 12 which placed the “club” in a difficult position regarding their financial position and if or how I may earn an income through this period.” \nBarba said the NRL failed to outline a clear return pathway, forcing him to take the big dollars on offer at Toulon. \n“I will say that until yesterday afternoon I had no clear pathway outlined to me of how I was entering back into rugby league,” he said. \n“A phone call from NRL CEO Todd Greenberg provided me for the first time since October a clear picture of my position which I thank Todd for taking the time to contact me and discuss it, also I openly provided him with my current circumstances.” \nThrough the guidance management, Barba decided Toulon was the best option for his family and himself. \nThe Sharks premiership-winner said he was now focused on proving his worth in rugby union. \nHe also expressed his gratitude to Cronulla and the rugby league community for his opportunities in the NRL. \n“I am happy with my decision and I am very much looking forward to the challenge and the new chapter in my life,” he said. \n“It’s a fresh start and hopefully a successful one, I wish my teammates at the Sharks all the very best for the 2017 season. \n“I would first like to thank Shane, Lyall and the entire Cronulla Sharks Football club for everything they have done for both my family and I. \n“It is certainly appreciated and won’t be forgotten. \n“To the rugby league fans and community please believe me when I say rugby league has given me everything and I owe rugby league and the many fans, volunteers and administers for the tremendous work they do as without them I would never have had the privilege to play rugby league at the highest levels.” \nWhile Barba is excited to join Toulon, he admitted his exit from league was his own fault. \n“In regard to the incident at the back end of last year, I take full responsibility for my actions,” he said. \n“I made a terrible mistake and I own it and will have to live it. \n“I have four young daughters which will one day ask the question about how I won a grand final with my best mates at the Sharks and then made a poor choice which changed my life and my reputation forever, that is a hard conversation I am not looking forward to”. \nBarba also clarified comments he made on television that the “NRL haven’t given me much”. \nThe fullback said he was referring to the NRL’s lack of information regarding his return, not his appreciation for the sport. \n“I was caught off guard by Channel 7’s Josh Massoud in the driveway of my home whilst placing my tired daughter in her car seat,” he said. \n“I was misunderstood by the comment I made relating to (NRL haven’t given me much) this comment was not meant that the NRL the game has not given me much as I acknowledged before rugby league has given me everything. \n“I was hammered by a multiple questions whilst dealing with my children at my home, this made it extremely difficult to correctly respond and it certainly wasn’t appreciated. \n“I am only too happy to answer questions in my place of work as a professional athlete but I don’t believe since I am not a registered NRL player that I should be ambushed at the front door of my home whilst holding my children.” \nCronulla also released a statement on Thursday confirming Barba had accepted a long-term contract to join the Toulon Rugby Union Club in France. \n“We are of the understanding the contract with Toulon will be effective immediately,” the statement said. \n“Ben believes accepting this offer to be in the best interests of himself and his family. \n“While disappointed to be losing a player of his calibre, the welfare of Ben and his family is our main priority and we are supportive of the decision he has made. \n“As a member of our 2016 Premiership-winning side, we thank Ben for his service to the Cronulla Sharks and for the contribution he made towards our success.” More Local News ",
