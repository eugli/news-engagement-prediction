(Brian Bennett) \nThat was enough for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to take Ramirez into custody — something that happens infrequently with Dreamers. About 1,500 of the country’s 750,000 qualified Dreamers have been deported since Obama created DACA through executive action. \nObservers are watching the Seattle case for signs that President Trump might be quietly implementing the aggressive immigration enforcement he proposed during his campaign. \nCandidate Trump promised to end the Dreamers program, though he recently said DACA is “a very, very difficult subject for me … because you have these incredible kids.” \nNew documents filed by Ramirez’s attorneys include a note written by Ramirez seeking to be moved out of a section of the Tacoma immigration detention center reserved for gang members. Detainees there must wear orange uniforms. In the note, Ramirez wrote that he never belonged to gangs and had no criminal history. \nThe rest of the document is a subject of controversy. \nAuthorities have singled out a sentence that reads, “I have gang affiliation with gangs so I wear a orange uniform.” \nRamirez’s attorneys say the first seven words of the sentence were erased to change a statement into an admission of guilt, and a photograph appears to show smudge marks left by an eraser. His attorneys say the full sentence reads: “I came in and the officers said I have gang affiliation with gangs so I wear a orange uniform.” Attorneys for \"Dreamer\" Daniel Ramirez Medina say immigration officials erased part of a statement Ramirez wrote to suggest he admitted to associating with gangs.

Attorneys for \"Dreamer\" Daniel Ramirez Medina say immigration officials erased part of a statement Ramirez wrote to suggest he admitted to associating with gangs. (Counsel for Daniel Ramirez Medina) \nOne of Ramirez’s attorneys, Theodore J. Boutrous, said the government had “launched a public campaign to smear Mr. Ramirez’s reputation with a constantly shifting story of gang membership and criminal history. While the narrative has shifted multiple times in the last 48 hours alone, one thing has remained consistent: Their claims are all unsubstantiated and untrue.” \nAccording to Ramirez’s detailed statement to the court, he awoke Feb. 10 in the small, barren suburban apartment he shared with family members suburban Des Moines, Wash., to find the room crowded with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. \nThey came to arrest Ramirez’s father, who has been deported and returned at least eight times, records show. The ICE agents also questioned Ramirez and his brother. They took Ramirez into custody but not the brother, who is also a DACA recipient. \nRamirez is the father of a 3-year-old son who lives with Ramirez’s mother near Fresno. According to a statement by Ramirez in court documents, he said he was up to date with DACA requirements and had the papers to prove it. \nBut the agents kept asking about a tattoo, which spelled out “La Paz – BCS” and included a nautical star. \n“When I was 18, I really liked the way tattoos looked, like a lot of people do,” Ramirez said in the statement. So he had a friend do one on his forearm, he added. “La Paz is where I’m from. BCS stands for Baja California Sur, where La Paz is. I decided to go with my hometown because I have seen a lot of people do that.” \nMark Rosenbaum, lead co-counsel for Ramirez, said, “We will continue to fight for Daniel’s immediate release as long as the government continues its unjustified and unlawful detention. We appreciate the court’s directive that Mr. Ramirez be granted a timely bond hearing in immigration court, which will allow us another opportunity to request his release.” Caption Landslide threatens homes, fire station and major road in San Bernardino County mountains \nSurveillance video footage shows the moment a hillside in the San Bernardino County mountains crumbles, sending rocks and snow into a drainage area below. \nSurveillance video footage shows the moment a hillside in the San Bernardino County mountains crumbles, sending rocks and snow into a drainage area below.
