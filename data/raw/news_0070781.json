Here are some sample questions: 1. What do we call the first 10 amendments to the Constitution? 2. How many amendments does the Constitution have? 3. What is the name of the current president of the United States? 4. If both the president and vice president can no longer serve, who becomes president? 5. How many justices serve on the Supreme Court? RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:22:52.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
