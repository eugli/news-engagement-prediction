The hospital made the move last year after it was discovered that the ventilation system in the labour and delivery unit had rust contamination.\nThe new project involves amalgamating the maternity, newborn and neonatal intensive care units, adjacent to an operating room.\n\"The efficiencies and the safety that that brings to the delivery experience is sort of hard to quantify, but it's a real thing and it's a palpable thing,\" said Dr. Ken Gillespie, medical director of women and children's health.\nIn addition, he said, it will give patients and their families greater privacy and improve the quality of the experience.\nDr. Serge Melanson, chief of staff at the Moncton Hospital, speaks to CBC following a funding announcement by Premier Brian Gallant. (CBC News)\n\"When you're asking women to breastfeed and to get to know their new baby and you have other people in the room with them, that's just not a great way to deliver this type of care,\" Gillespie said.\n\"It's not the standard of care and it hasn't been the standard of care for a long time,\" he continued. \"So, this will really help to bring us up to the type of care and the quality of care that we should be delivering to our patients and that they deserve.\"\nUpon completion, the new maternity ward will have 20 private rooms. The goal, under current standards of care, is for each mother to have her own room and to potentially be able to remain there during delivery and for postpartum care.\nGillespie said the Moncton Hospital receives patients from Campbellton, Bathurst and Miramichi, as well as the nearby Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre, and even Amherst, N.S.\n\"So, really what this is, is an investment in improving the quality of care for not just families in the Moncton area, but for really the eastern half of the province.\"\n'It's full steam ahead' Hospital chief of staff, Dr. Serge Melanson, said the funding allows the hospital to proceed with the redevelopment of the labour and delivery unit, neonatal intensive care unit and new cardiac care units — all of which he said are in \"desperate need of renovation.\"\n\"Without the funding announcement and the dollars to go with the projects, we were at a bit of a standstill, but now it's full steam ahead, basically,\" Melanson said.\nAs for specific services, the chief of staff said that the Moncton Hospital will be able to enhance the maternal-fetal health services offered in its labour and delivery unit. That's a sub-speciality of obstetrics that manages high-risk or complicated pregnancies, he explained, adding that it isn't available at every hospital in the province.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:30:53.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
