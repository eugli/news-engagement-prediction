Slot to 247Sports Links \nThe son of the late legendary boxer Muhammad Ali was detained for several hours at a Florida airport after returning from a trip to Jamaica, according to a report by the Courier-Journal . The Ali family says that Muhammad Ali, Jr. was probed at length by immigration officials about his Muslim faith. \nMuhammad Ali Jr., 44, and his mother Khalilah Camacho-Ali, the second wife of Muhammad Ali, were arriving at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Feb. 7 after returning from speaking at a Black History Month event in Montego Bay, Jamaica. They were pulled aside while going through customs because of their Arabic-sounding names, according to family friend and lawyer Chris Mancini. \nImmigration officials let Camacho-Ali go after she showed them a photo of herself with her ex-husband, but her son did not have such a photo. Mancini said officials held and questioned Ali Jr. for nearly two hours, repeatedly asking him, \"Where did you get your name from?\" and \"Are you Muslim?\" \nWhen Ali Jr. responded that yes, he is a Muslim, the officers kept questioning him about his religion and where he was born. Ali Jr. was born in Philadelphia in 1972 and holds a U.S. passport. \nReached for comment via email Friday, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said, \"Due to the restrictions of the Privacy Act, U.S. Customs and Border Protection cannot discuss individual travelers; however, all international travelers arriving in the U.S. are subject to CBP inspection.\" \nThe line of questioning is indicative of profiling and designed to produce answers that corroborate what officials want to hear, Mancini said. Neither Camacho-Ali nor Ali Jr. have ever been subjected to detainment before, despite extensive global travel experience, he said. \n\"To the Ali family, it's crystal clear that this is directly linked to Mr. Trump's efforts to ban Muslims from the United States,\" Mancini said, \nMuhammad Ali, Sr. died in June 2016 at the age of 74. He is one of the most famous Muslim Americans in history. Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:30:44.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
