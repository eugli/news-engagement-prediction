I was the Deputy Commissioner of Comilla at that time. No one can dispute the fact,” Huda told bdnews24.com. \n“Those who are in politics, they say everything from their political point of view. I have nothing to say about it,” he said. \nBNP Secretary General Mirza Fakrul Islam Alamgir earlier claimed that Nurul Huda was one of the government officials who attended so-called Janatar Manch in 1996. \n“An independent constitutional body like EC cannot be run efficiently by such a controversial person,” Fakrul added. Huda was, however, sent to forced retirement in 2001 when the BNP was in power. The government decision was reversed in court, and he retired as a secretary during an Awami League tenure.\nThe President picked Nurul Huda as CEC from among the 10 names put forward by the search committee earlier in the week. Four other commissioners have also been chosen from the list. \nThe new EC is going to take oath on Feb 15 amid BNP rejecting the President’s selections as “reflection of Prime Minister’s wish.” \nOne of the main tasks the new EC will have to conduct a general election for the 11th parliament due to be held in early Jan 2019. \nThe BNP had boycotted the 2014 elections questioning the impartiality of the outgoing Commission led by Kazi Rakibuddin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T21:21:34.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
