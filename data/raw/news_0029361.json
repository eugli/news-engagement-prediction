Leicester, Leicester, Leicester. What's happened to you? \nThe world was in love with the Foxes this time last year as their remarkable Premier League title bid started to seem real. On Valentine's Day 2016 the Foxes were two points clear at the top of the table, but now they have fallen apart like a bad relationship. \nAfter their defeat at Swansea on Sunday, Claudio Ranieri's side are just one point and one place above the relegation zone, and they could theoretically be bottom of the division by the time they play their next league game against Liverpool on February 27th. You won't find the answers down there, lads (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \"It just doesn't feel the same any more, Wes\" (Photo: Rex Features) \nThere is a growing belief that we could be about to see the reigning English champions be relegated for the first time since Manchester City went down in 1937. \nAnd a look at these eight shocking stats won't make good reading for Foxes fans.

(Photo: Stu Forster) Leicester are the only team in England's top four tiers yet to score a single league goal in 2017 Looking up would help (Photo: Getty) The Foxes remain without an away win in the Premier League since a 2-0 victory at Sunderland last April, and they are on a run of 15 away games without a win (D5 L10). Only once before in the Premier League have they had a longer winless away run, going 16 games without a win between December 2001 and October 2003. Foxes fans in happier times (Photo: Plumb Images) Last season, Jamie Vardy (10) and Riyad Mahrez (12) scored a combined 22 goals away from home in the Premier League â€“ this season they have scored three (Vardy on one, Mahrez with two) Have you seen these men?
