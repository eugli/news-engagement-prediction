A second bill would eliminate the term “copy” from the statute, eliminating the premise behind Healey’s actions.\nLast month, gun rights activists aided by the NRA filed a lawsuit targeting the state’s 1998 assault weapons ban.\nMassachusetts has some of the strictest guns laws in the country and the nation’s lowest gun death rate in 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:03:40.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
