(Picture: Rex) \nThey analysed samples from four other fast food chains in Ontario, including McDonald’s and Wendy’s. Carriage horse 'collapses' while pulling tourists through New York \nMost were almost 100% chicken (seasoning and marinating would be expected to bring it down slightly), but the result from Subway was so much of an outlier that researchers bought more chicken to carry out the test again. \nThe results the second time confirmed the first, leading one customer CBC interviewed, Irena Valenta, to accuse the chain of ‘misrepresentation’ if less than half of the strip was actually chicken. \nFood scientist Ben Bohrer, from the University of Guelph, told CBC fast food chicken is often ‘restructured’– meaning it’s made from smaller pieces of meat bound together rather than from a single cut of meat. \nExtra ingredients such as chemicals or soy may be added to preserve it for longer or bulk it out so it’s cheaper. \nThere is no suggestion the samples tested were unsafe. Subway responded \nMetro.co.uk has contacted Subway for comment and to ask about meat used in chicken sandwiches in the UK. \nThe chain previously responded to CBC, questioning the accuracy of the tests as their recipes call for one per cent or less of soy protein in chicken products. \n‘Subway Canada cannot confirm the veracity of the results of the lab testing you had conducted,’ the spokesman said. \n‘However, we are concerned by the alleged findings you cite with respect to the proportion of soy content. \n‘Our chicken strips and oven roasted chicken contain 1% or less of soy protein. \n‘We use this ingredient in these products as a means to help stabilize the texture and moisture. \n‘All of our chicken items are made from 100% white meat chicken which is marinated, oven roasted and grilled. \n‘We tested our chicken products recently for nutritional and quality attributes and found it met our food quality standards. \n‘We will look into this again with our supplier to ensure that the chicken is meeting the high standard we set for all of our menu items and ingredients.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:45:52.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
