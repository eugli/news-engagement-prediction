So I guess that’s the approach. But this was too much. To compare this to 9-11 – I think that’s just too much.” \nNelson emailed a series of anguished ruminations on Donald Trump’s ascent to Calhoun parents, simultaneously calling for non-partisanship while skewering the billionaire’s policies. \nIn a message sent last week, Nelson, who also teaches journalism at the pre-K through 12 campus, noted his intimate familiarity with several recent catastrophes – including 9-11. \n“I watched soot-covered New Yorkers grimly trudging north on West End Avenue on September 11, 2001,” Nelson wrote. “I am more troubled now.” \nElsewhere in the lengthy missive, Nelson acknowledged the theoretical need to avoid political bias in a school environment. “One in my position must be scrupulous in avoiding partisanship,” he said. \nBut he later asserted in the same message that “there are matters that transcend political diversity.” \n“The ways in which equity and equality are now threatened are deeply troubling, including the constitutionally suspect and arguably discriminatory efforts to restrict or prohibit immigration based on religion and/or ethnicity,” he wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:55:15.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
