Prominent new features include virtual GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) support , new \"perf c2c\" tool that can be used for analysis of cacheline contention on NUMA systems, support for the L2/L3 caches of Intel processors (Intel Cache Allocation Technology), eBPF hooks for cgroups, hybrid block polling, and better writeback management. A new \"perf sched timehist\" feature has been added in Linux kernel 4.10 to provide detailed history of task scheduling, and there's experimental writeback cache and FAILFAST support for MD RAID5... Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) could be the first stable OS to ship with Linux 4.10. It required 13,000 commits, plus over 1,200 merges, Linus wrote in the announcement , adding \"On the whole, 4.10 didn't end up as small as it initially looked.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:40:29.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
