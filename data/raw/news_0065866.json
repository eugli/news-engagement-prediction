Probably not, at least according to Jessica Brillhart, a virtual reality filmmaker at Google who tried to mimic that experience in a new video. A stormy Kenny G experience Spotted by Bloomberg reporter Mark Bergen , “ Conditions at Omaha ” is a three-minute VR clip that pulls together four different local weather forecasts that aired in Omaha, Nebraska in the 1990s. The soundtrack is, of course, Kenny G, a man who managed to tame the saxophone enough to make it palatable for flash flood warnings. Hard to imagine checking the weather while listening to a Kenny G song called “One Night Stand,” but it has probably happened to you. “I’ve been biting at the bit to create a place of calm and serenity similar to that of watching The Weather Channel in the 90's while sitting a foot away from the television screen,” Brillhart wrote in a blog post . “I’m not entirely sure why, but I decided fairly quickly that this project would be an homage to Omaha weather. An ‘Omahomage’ as it were.” The resulting video is cozy, weird, and just short enough so you can ignore the fact there’s absolutely no reason you’d need to know what the weather was like in Omaha two decades ago. The video is available in 360-degrees on YouTube, and is compatible with Google Cardboard and Daydream View . Hot tip: make sure you look up and down while watching.
