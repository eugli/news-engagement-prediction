Mr Pusey was the other driver. \n\"On one occasion she was present overnight in one of the hotels. Her involvement in obtaining the girls, even encouraging them and so on, is clearly shown in telephone elements which we will come to later. \n\"She doesn't really dispute that people were coming to her house, that she knew the other defendants, that she took people to the hotels, we say the girls to the hotels, but she claims she had no idea that there was sexual activity going on or the girls were underage.\" Read More \"I can't get that man out my head\": Trauma of girl, 11, molested by paedophile in Hamleys Carson, 18, seen at Guildford Crown Court (Photo: INS News Agency Ltd) \nThe jury heard that it was through an underage girl's \"network of friends and contacts\" that Chilcott's \"access was gained to those various other girls.\" \n\"It must have been absolutely obvious to her that these were underage girls,\" said Mr May. \nChilcott, Robert Carson, aged 18 years, from Gurell Grove, London, Jerrell Sutherland, aged 24 years, from Milwards in Harlow, Essex, and Pusey, formerly from West Drayton, Middlesex, stood before a jury of four women and eight men jointly charged with three counts of facilitating travel to exploit at Travelodges in Slough, Berks., Twickenham, London, and Staines-upon-Thames, Surrey, in early 2016. \nThe court heard the four defendants booked rooms and made five trips to the Travelodges in January and February after Pusey met one of them at a New Year's Eve party. \nHotel records showed that they attended and had been evicted following noise complaints and after security found them smoking in rooms, said Mr May. \nPusey also faced two counts of having penetrative sex with a 14-year-old girl between September and November 2014. \nJurors heard the victim told police that they had sex 10 times and how the alleged paedophile \"would not stop bugging me.\" \nHe also denied two counts of penetrative sex with a child in January 3 and February 6, at Travelodges, and one of sexual activity with a child when he was arrested while in bed with a 13-year-old girl at his home on January 17, in 2016. \nThe trial before Judge Stephen Climie continues.
