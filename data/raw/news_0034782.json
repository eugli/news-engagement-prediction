There had been a lot of speculation, and in an unconventional move the love-struck prince released a long statement about his relationship from Kensington Palace. \nThe couple appear to be going steady. They've passed some sizeable milestones, in fact. Prince Harry met Markle's parents over in the US (before their relationship went public, it transpires), while she in turn has since met his family, too, including brother Prince William.

Yes, the Queen . You probably know of her. \nNow sure, it's quite an antiquated idea that you should ask permission from family members before asking for your lover's hand in marriage. You might argue that asking a father of your would-be bride is sexist.

Rather, he's bound by English law, which stipulates that he has to ask the permission of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, before proposing to someone. \nIt's down to the The Royal Marriages Act . The law dates back to 1772, and was passed by King George III after he disapproved of his brothers’ marriages. \nThe law states that reigning monarchs must grant approval to direct descendents. If the sovereign says no, technically, royals aren't able to get married. Very archaic. \"She's the pretty brunette.

Who knows. But people are speculating, hoping. We imagine there are murmurs. \nBut the fact is, a wedding can't be close until the Queen has signed a notice to give her formal consent. She has to trust the spouse – and she's not even met her yet. \nThe good news is that the Queen has never denied a marriage request. But she's probably not all that eager to meet Markle. It took Kate Middleton four years of dating to get an introduction. The Queen is busy with her corgis and gin, you see.
