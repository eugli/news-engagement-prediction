KING RODRIGUEZ/ Presidential Photo \nFinance Secretary Carlos “Sonny” Dominguez III on Tuesday said President Rodrigo Duterte raised $33 billion (P1.617 trillion) in commitments from his visits to other countries. \n“In total, the President has raised a total of $33 billion in all these trips,” Dominguez said in Palace briefing. \nThe Secretary pointed out that it was a large amount compared to the $5.5 million, or P270 million, spent on his travels abroad.
