During the Oscars, host Jimmy Kimmel brought a gaggle of unwitting normals into the Dolby Theatre—the only people in Los Angeles, apparently, who didn’t know that the Oscars were happening Sunday night. How did ABC manage to find this group? Your guess is as good as ours—but find them, they apparently did. And thanks to their efforts, the gala got two more heroes: Gary and Vicki from Chicago. Kimmel, who had already taken a moment Sunday night to salute his inspiration, Dave Letterman, concocted a bit that seems to take its cues from the sort of off-the-cuff segments the former Late Show and Late Night host was known for. Though Kimmel’s riff ran a little long, Gary and Vicki easily stole the show—especially when they met their favorite actor, Denzel Washington. Kimmel noted that Gary seemed to be ignoring the white actors as he paced in front of the front row. Gary’s frank response? “I am.” \nhttps://twitter.com/VON_netta/status/836055383651266561 When Vicki informed Kimmel that she and Gary are engaged to be married this summer, a serendipitous moment happened: Washington was asked to be their best man. The Oscar winner proceeded to officiate a mini ceremony. And then there were Gary’s sartorial choices, which did not escape the notice of some eagle-eyed Twitter users, including New York magazine’s Rembert Browne.
