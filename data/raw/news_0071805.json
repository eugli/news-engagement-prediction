Multiple carriers are preparing their networks for such speeds, including T-Mobile, which recently announced plans to deliver gigabit LTE over unused 5GHz Wi-Fi channels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:58:06.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
