That's on top of the 55% increase Berkshire Hathaway reported its stake in Apple rose between its second- and third-quarter. \nThe fund brushed off several stocks in which it formerly held massive stakes. It completely dumped its stake in Deere ( DE ) . It sold off the vast majority of its Walmart ( WMT ) and Verizon ( VZ , Tech30 ) stock. It formerly owned more than 15 million shares of Verizon, but now has just 928. Its Walmart stake dipped to 1.4 million shares from nearly 13 million. \nBerkshire also made new investments in agrochemical firm Monsanto ( MON ) and satellite radio company Sirius XM ( SIICF ) .
