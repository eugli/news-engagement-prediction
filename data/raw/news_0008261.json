The source, at the direction of law enforcement, recorded an internet video chat with Vitayanon. \nEXCLUSIVE: Brooklyn man busted for selling meth, GHB, steroids \nCourt papers say Vitayanon could be seen smoking what looked like meth from a glass pipe and agreed to send an ounce to the source on consignment. \nVitayanon then allegedly texted the source the next day to say he was packaging the meth. He requested a $1,650 deposit for a bank account of his and another controlled by the Arizona source. \nThe package was eventually seized. When authorities searched Vitayanon's apartment, prosecutors said they found methamphetamine, drug paraphernalia, packaging materials and drug ledgers. Vitayanon, 41, was arrested in Washington, D.C., and is scheduled to be arraigned in D.C. federal court Thursday.
