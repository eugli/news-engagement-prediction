A 20-year-old Emirati man, accused of raping a drunk woman at knifepoint in the desert with his compatriot friend, has been sentenced to one year in jail on charges of rape with the use of force and threat. The Court of First Instance closed the case against the other accused after he died. The incident, as told by the victim, a 33-year-old Moroccan, took place on August 23, 2014. She said she went after 2:45am to a night club at a hotel on Shaikh Zayed Road to meet her friend but found it was closed. She was waiting outside when the two men stopped for her. One of the two accused stepped off and dragged her inside the car as she was under the influence of alcohol. They drove towards Dubai-Al Ain Road and stopped in a desert area. There, one of them put a bottle of alcohol in her mouth, trying to force her to drink. They also stripped her of her clothes and snatched her mobile phone. One of them told her that if she did not do as they pleased they would cut her throat and bury her there, and took turns raping her. Later, she took the knife and ran away. She stabbed the car's driver in the hand as he was trying to catch her. She was totally naked when a vehicle, driven by two Asians carrying chicken, stopped for her and gave her clothes to cover her body. A Bangladeshi man, 32, said that the victim stopped him and his friend as they were driving on Dubai-Al Ain Road towards Ajman around 4:30 am. \"She was crying and looked scared and nervous. We tried to stop the cars that were passing by so that any driver would take her to her home. But drivers were slowing down and then continuing after seeing her naked. The two men had to let her sit next to them in the front after they gave her a shirt to cover herself. They went to Ajman for some work and then drove her to her place in Al Nahda. The 20-year-old defendant admitted that he and his friend drove the victim who was then drunk to a desert area where they raped her at knifepoint. The ruling has been appealed. mary@khaleejtimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:47:27.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
