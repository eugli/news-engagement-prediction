That's the latest speculation. (Photo: Rob Schumacher/azcentral sports) \nChicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler to the Cardinals? \nSpeculation has been running rampant this week. \nazcentral sports' Kent Somers quickly put the speculation to rest on Tuesday morning: \nHe wrote that Arizona has \"zero interest\" in the quarterback. Regarding Cutler to Cardinals speculation: Cardinals have zero interest in Cutler. None. \nThe speculation began with Sports Illustrated's Peter King, who, in his Monday Morning Quarterback column wrote: \"Cutler? I’m not going to be shocked if he ends up in Arizona.\" \nHe later expounded on the idea. \nKing wrote : \"Name the counter-culture coach who likes to take shots on guys hated by lots of down-the-middle coaches and GMs, who is the biggest proponent of the deep ball of any coach in football, and who may need said deep ball thrower because his quarterback turns 38 this year. I think I just made a Bruce Arians-Jay Cutler marriage—and Arizona can wait until the Bears cut him and sign Cutler for two years and incentives. This doesn’t mean Arizona won’t aggressively scout college kids though.\" VOTE: The #AZCardinals have 'zero interest' in QB Jay Cutler. Should they be interested in him? (Story: https://t.co/yWJQNW1Afs ) — azcentral sports (@azcsports) February 21, 2017 \nCutler, 33, has started 139 games in his career (11 seasons). He's 2,782 for 4,491 passing (61.9 percent), for 32,467 yards. He has 208 touchdown passes and 146 interceptions. \nHe started his career in Denver with the Broncos for three seasons and has been in Chicago with the Bears for the last eight. \nazcentral sports' Paola Boivin wrote this about Cutler in December: \n\"Jay Cutler? Talk about divisive. He is 33 and has taken a physical beating, but plenty will tell you Cutler’s talents are greater than many of the free agent candidates. It is widely believed the Chicago Bears are done with him.\" \nCutler was the 16th highest paid QB in the NFL last season. He made 18.1 million. \nCutler almost previously ended up with Cardinals coach Bruce Arians. \nazcentral sports' Bob McManaman detailed what happened in 2015: \nA day before he signed with the Cardinals in January 2013, Arians interviewed for the Bears’ vacant head coaching position and thought he had won it after his interview at Halas Hall. He even spent a couple of hours talking with Cutler, sharing his plans for the team. \nMuch to the surprise of most Chicagoans, however, the Bears selected Marc Trestman over Arians. Trestman was fired after two seasons and replaced by John Fox. \n\"I loved the guy,” Cutler said of Arians. “You could tell right away that the guys were going to like him and buy into what he had to say. He was a guy’s guy. He could sit around and shoot the (expletive) with you or sit around and do whatever. I really enjoyed my time with him. \n\"He knew offensive football; that was the least of his concern. He had a great plan and obviously Arizona picked him and got a great coach.”' \nArians, in turn, liked what he heard from Cutler. \n“I met a guy that was very passionate about the game, wanted to win and was willing to do whatever it took to win,” the coach said. “I always felt he might be the most misunderstood quarterback in the league. … It’s a lot easier when you stay in the same system your whole career. But when you go through three or four in four or five years, it’s extremely hard on you.” \nThis isn't the first quarterback speculation to take off for the Cardinals. \nThat quieted with the announcement that Carson Palmer would be coming back to Arizona. @kentsomers why would this even be a story with Palmer already announcing he's back?
