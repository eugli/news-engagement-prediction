And French Vogue just made their March issue an even bigger deal by putting a transgender model on the cover for the first time. Brazilian model Valentina Sampaio appears in a metallic dress, with the cover line reading “Transgender beauty: How they’re shaking up the world.”\n“This cover is about the importance of [human] rights, and that we still need to make progress on an awful lot of stuff,” French Vogue editor in chief Emmanuelle Alt told American Vogue . The accompanying story features Sampaio modeling the latest spring collections, photographed by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. We can only hope for more fashion spreads like this on our side of the Atlantic.\nTags: french vogue valentina sampaio emmanuelle alt mert alas and marcus piggott fashions cover girl More French Vogue Features Its First Transgender Cover Model Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Kellyanne Conway Goes Full Fatal Attraction on Saturday Night Live Chris Evans and Jenny Slate’s Breakup Proves That Love Is Shell T.J.
