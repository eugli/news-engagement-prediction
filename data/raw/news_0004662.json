Trump purchased the club from Ritz and effectively saved it because it was in financial ruin. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we disagree with the judge’s ruling and intend to appeal it,” Garten said.\nFollowing the judge’s decision, Brad Edwards, attorney for the club members, said, “I have never been more confident after trying a case that this would be the result. To me, it was just a matter of time before this verdict came, but I’m glad we got it.”\nHe added, “It’s the entire amount we asked for — to the dollar. They created their own contorted reading of a contract that allowed them to avoid the refundability of the deposits.”\nThe lawsuit stemmed from an assertion that, under prior ownership, the members had a “refundable” membership.\n  Obama’s Statement Supporting Protests Of Trump’s Executive Order Ticks Off MSNBC Host 2 GOP Senators Vow To Oppose DeVos On Senate Floor Trump Cancels Signing Of Cybersecurity Executive Order This would let members wishing to leave the club pay dues until another member could be found to continue paying the dues.\nThe plaintiffs charged that when the Trump Organization purchased the property in 2013, their “refundable” status was terminated.\nWhile Trump was not named in the lawsuit, he was deposed and his deposition was presented during the trial in August.\nWhat do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:07:53.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
