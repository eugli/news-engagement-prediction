It refers to prisoners using various programs involving Indigenous traditions and ceremonies.\nGertie Pierre, left is the aunt of Cheryl Ann Joe, Melodie Casella is her cousin. Both hope the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women will address their concerns with victims' rights in the justice system. (Melodie Casella)\nThese programs were started in the 1990s for Indigenous people, but over time Corrections has allowed all inmates, regardless of their ancestry, to participate.\n\"One of the core values of Aboriginal spirituality is inclusiveness, so it kind of came from within [the Aboriginal community],\" Parole Board spokesperson Patrick Storey said.\nIn Allender's case, because the family was so outraged, on the day of the parole hearing, the board denied him the elder assisted hearing — a small victory for Joe's family.\n'He is still not accountable' Earlier this year, the parole board also denied Allender's request for day and full parole.\nHowever, recent parole board documents show that Allender has already been on 59 work releases. Most were in other institutions, but seven were in the community, under escort.\n\"He was granted this 'right' even though he verbally is not accountable for his actions and 25 years later he still blames the movie The Silence of the Lambs for his actions,\" Casella said.\nCasella was only registered through Victim's Services in March of last year and was told that's why the family was not consulted prior to Allender's previous work releases.\nNow that she is, Casella hopes to have more of a say.\nAllender recently withdrew his latest request to for an escorted temporary release, after the family expressed concerns.\nGertie Pierre wears a shirt in memory of her niece Cheryl Ann Joe at an event in North Vancouver in 2014. (Jonathan Hayward/Canadian Press)\nFamily hopes 'flaws' addressed at national inquiry Last month, on the 25th anniversary of Joe's murder, Pierre got a call from the parole board that stunned her.\n\"We were told three of our victim impact statements with our full names were given to another offender at Mountain [Institution],\" Pierre said.\nAllender, like any offender seeking parole, is given the victim impact statements prior to a hearing. But this time, those statements were accidently handed to the wrong inmate.\nThe parole board confirmed the privacy breach, calling it \"rare\" and \"serious.\"\n\"The staff member who did this was called on to the carpet and consequences of their actions were shared which include very negative effects on victims,\" Storey said.\n'We're very much aware of the impatience': MMIW commissioners reassure families at 1st press conference Women and girls to remain primary focus of MMIW inquiry, commission says Casella and Pierre still want further investigation into the risk the breach may have had on their family.\nThey hope the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women can address victim's right's within the justice system — and parole hearings in particular.\n\"Cheryl wanted to make a difference, and she was always the older cousin who protected us,\" Casella said.\n\"It is my hope that we can now protect others in her memory.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1448633299414/1448633350146"], "published": "2017-02-14T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:29:54.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
