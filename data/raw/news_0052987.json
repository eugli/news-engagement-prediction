The firm was fined Â£200,000.\nShe was submerged in water at the bottom of the well but was able to stay afloat with the help of a hosepipe fed down to her by neighbours.\nIt was more than an hour before she was rescued from the well by the Fire Service.\nAn HSE investigation concluded that Strakers had failed to assess the risks to the public and that no health and safety management system had been in place.\nHSE Inspector Matt Tyler told the judge that three days before the open house event Strakers had been informed by an earlier prospective buyer of the existence of the well under the piece of board yet no action had been taken.\nHe added that the house was part of the estate of a woman who had died and there was therefore no-one who knew the property well to ask about possible risks.\nStrakers, he said, had no systems in place for risk assessment in the case of properties that were part of a deceased person's estate and serious risks such as asbestos or electrical safety could neither be identified nor controlled.\nHe said that when Strakers had been informed of the existence of the well, one of their employees, Tim Peters, had visited the house, looked at the wooden board and assumed that the well underneath would be covered by a metal grill.\nMr Peters did not lift the board to check for himself, Mr Tyler said.\nAndrew McLaughlin, counsel representing Strakers, told the judge that the company was sorry Mrs Driver had fallen down the well and accepted that Mr Peter's inspection on April 19 should have been more thorough than it was.\nHe maintained, however, that the company's culpability for the incident was low.\nJudge Simon Cooper said he found both Strakers' culpability and the risk of harm to be high.\nHe said: \"As a result of the breach a number of people were exposed to very significant harm.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:33:33.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
