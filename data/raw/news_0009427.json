Mr Mattis is expected to discuss the deployment on Friday.\nBut the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defence system is unpopular with many South Koreans - who fear missile bases could become targets and endanger people who live nearby. It has also has angered China, which says it goes \"far beyond the defence needs of the Korean peninsula\".\nSpeaking on Thursday, Mr Mattis sought to reassure China, saying there is \"no other nation that needs to be concerned about THAAD other than North Korea\".\nMr Han said Mr Mattis's visit \"communicates the strongest warning to North Korea\".\nThere are just under 28,500 US military personnel based in South Korea, as part of a post-war arrangement. South Korea pays about $900m (Â£710m) annually towards the deployment.\nMr Mattis will travel to Japan later on Friday, where there are a further 50,000 soldiers plus their dependents and support staff in Japan. The US pays about $5.5bn for its Japanese bases in 2016, with Japan paying a further $4bn.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4B0D/production/_93931291_mediaitem93931290.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/66761000/gif/_66761510_missile_defence_624.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-38824008", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/E74D/production/_93931295_a3394e48-98fa-4d1e-a66d-4ac7fdb04c42.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-03T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:27:56.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
