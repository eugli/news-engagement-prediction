It attributed this to the inmates securing gainful and stable employment, as well as family and community support, and their own personal resolve not to run afoul of the law again. (Table: Singapore Prison Service) \nSPS also noted that a consistently high percentage of inmates secured jobs before they were released. \nIn 2016, 96 per cent of inmates who were referred to the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) found work before they left prison - comparable to the 95 per cent in 2015 and 96 per cent in 2014. \nSCORE offers skills training that is aligned with the national Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) framework. \nThe prison service noted that strong support from the community is crucial in the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. \nThe number of employers registered with SCORE increased by 7.3 per cent from 4,745 in 2015 to 5,093 in 2016. \nThis reflects the communityâ€™s increased acceptance of inmates and ex-offenders as well as commitment to giving them second chances, it said. - CNA/dt ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:12:39.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
