"language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "51 things to know \nCountry star Luke Bryan will sing the national anthem at this year's Super Bowl, while Gaga will take to the world's biggest stage for the halftime show, and since no one likes to do the Super Bowl halftime show alone, Gaga has invited Tony Bennett to join her. \nThat's right, the 90-year-old crooner will be singing at the Super Bowl this year. \nThere was also a rumor that Beyonce might join Gaga for the halftime show since the Super Bowl is being played in Queen Bey's hometown of Houston, however, Gaga shot that rumor down on Thursday. \n\"She's always very inspiring and gives great advice, she's a very focused and genuine performer,\" Gaga said. \nGaga also added that she might take a few cues from Beyonce, but that the singer won't be on stage with her. \n\"I'm going to be taking the spirit of many performers with me on that stage when I go up there,\" Gaga said. \"I'm grateful to have wonderful women in this business that are supportive of me.\" \nThe last time the Super Bowl was in Houston, the words \"wardrobe malfunction\" entered the national lexicon after Janet Jackson's breast was exposed during the show. Gaga said that's not going to happen on Sunday. Gaga says don't expect a wardrobe malfunction, \"Everything's going to be nice and tight for the game, so I wouldn't worry about that.\" pic.twitter.com/MqXWWTbcKm â€” John Breech (@johnbreech) February 2, 2017 \nOne thing Gaga didn't touch on is whether or not there will be drones flying around during her show. CNN has reported that Gaga is going to have \"hundreds of lit-up drones\" flying around the stadium for her show. The wild thing about that is that Gaga reportedly had to get FAA approval before she was allowed to move forward with her idea. \nAnyway, the Super Bowl show is a big deal for Gaga, because apparently, the 30-year-old singer has been waiting 26 years to sing at halftime of the Super Bowl. \n\"I've been planning this since I was 4, so I know exactly what I'm going to do,\" Gaga said recently . \"For me, it's all about giving to the fans and bringing people together that wouldn't normally come together.\" Lady Gaga has been waiting a long time to perform at the Super Bowl. Instagram/ladygaga \nThere have been some wild halftime shows over the past few years -- um, everybody remembers Katy Perry, right -- but Gaga seems determined to top them all when she takes the stage at halftime of the Feb. 5 game between the Patriots and the Falcons . \n\"The thing is, is it's such a big world stage in terms of how many people see it and it's been done so many times,\" Gaga said. \"I think the challenge is to look at it and say, 'What can I do differently, how can I elevate certain little things here and there and also make it about the music?'\" \nApparently, Gaga is literally going to try and elevate things. One report has suggested that Gaga may attempt to do part of the show from the roof at NRG Stadium. There's also a chance that Donald Trump's name could be mentioned . If his name does come up, it won't be a compliment, because Gaga is not a Trump fan. \nGaga didn't confirm or deny either report during her pre-show press conference that was held on Feb. 2. \nWhatever happens in the show, you can probably expect an A+ performance from Gaga's dancers because they've spent hours rehearsing inside of a giant tent that's set up in Gaga's backyard. If you get dizzy easily, don't watch the video below of the giant tent, because it's sideways and it's confusing.

Your first look #BTS of #PepsiHalftime as @RICHYSQUIRREL gets @LadyGaga 's dancers ready to make us ðŸ™€ðŸ™€ðŸ™€ Feb 5th! pic.twitter.com/NlteGrS7Wa \nPepsi is the official sponsor of the halftime show, so of course, they've been documenting Gaga's entire rehearsal process. \nHere is the complete list of previous Super Bowl halftime performers and themes \n2016 (Super Bowl 50): Coldplay, Beyonce, Bruno Mars 2015: Katy Perry, Lenny Kravitz and Missy Elliott Perry dances on stage with the unforgettable sharks.
