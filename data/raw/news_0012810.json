Now, the company is back with a new Android tablet, the A12, which takes many of the design elements and ideas behind the Yoga Book at a cheaper $299 starting price point. The A12 features the same touch-based Halo keyboard as the Yoga Book, with a similar promise that it will learn your typing habits as you use it, although without the unique pen integrations of its pricier sibling. Spec-wise, the A12 offers a 12.2-inch screen with an Intel Atom x5 processor, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage, and runs a similar version of Android with a three-column multi-window mode for multitasking. And of course, as a member of the Yoga family of devices, it features a 360-degree hinge to convert the A12 to a tablet form-factor. The Yoga A12 will be available on Lenovoâ€™s website on February 8th in either Gunmetal Grey or Rose Gold colors, starting at $299 for the base model.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:16:35.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
