The Twitter account @wyatt_privilege has resurfaced video that showed Maher on his previous show, Politically Incorrect , asking “how can a woman rape a man.” He was discussing the story of a 35-year-old female teacher’s relationship with a 14-year-old student with his panel, and he didn’t see it as statutory rape but rather society keeping a family apart because the student and teacher now had two children together. if bill maher thinks sunlight is the best disinfectant then here's him saying the same shit as milo, that it's ok for adults to fuck kids pic.twitter.com/tqPAzbGY3J Maher likewise has a long history of sexist and Islamophobic comments, the latter which Maher has long defended as being “not bigoted.” He doesn’t believe he’s making generalizations about Islam .\nHe compared singer Zayn Malik to Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , called the U.S. cowards for “lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away” while defending the 9/11 attackers for “staying in the airplane,” and believes Islamophobia was “a word created by fascists and used by cowards to manipulate morons.” \nHis comments on women were the subject of an attack ad by a conservative super PAC , and in 2009 he said in response to a story about Tila Tequila being assaulted by an ex-boyfriend , “the surprise is that someone hasn’t choked this bitch sooner.” \nBen Affleck , who appeared on the show in 2014 in a segment that went instantly viral, called Maher and fellow guest Sam Harris’ comments on Islam “gross and racist.” (Harris, appearing again in February 2017 , took shots at Affleck for that quip from more than two years ago.) On Friday’s episode of Real Time , Yiannopoulos praised Maher’s views on Islam and later explained to the New York Times that the reason he said “that’s not unreasonable” about not wanting to share a bathroom with transgender people is because women have told him that. When pressed further, he said he didn’t believe that transgender people have a psychiatric disorder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:14:01.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
