Is Water Polar or Nonpolar? This is the three-dimensional structure of water. The hydrogen atoms are both on the same side of the molecule, so the charge is not evenly distributed. This makes water a polar molecule. Laguna Design, Getty Images Updated March 10, 2016 . Question: Why Is Water a Polar Molecule? \nWater is a polar molecule. Here is the explanation for why water is a polar molecule and why water is a polar solvent. \nAnswer: Water (H 2 O) is a polar solvent and each water molecule exhibits polarity because of the bent shape of the molecule. The shape means most of the negative charge from the oxygen on side of the molecule and the positive charge of the hydrogen atoms is on the other side of the molecule. This is an example of polar covalent chemical bonding . Polarity of a Water Molecule \nThe reason the shape of the molecule isn't linear and nonpolar (e.g., like CO 2 ) is because of the difference in electronegativity between hydrogen and oxygen. The electronegativity value of hydrogen is 2.1, while the electronegativity of oxygen is 3.5. The smaller the difference between electronegativity values, the more likely atoms will form a covalent bond. A large difference between electronegativity values is seen with ionic bonds. \ncontinue reading below our video Learn About Molecules and Moles Hydrogen and oxygen are both acting as nonmetals under ordinary conditions, but oxygen is quite a bit more electronegative than hydrogen, so the two atoms form a covalent chemical bond, but it's polar. \nThe highly electronegative oxygen atom attracts electrons or negative charge to it, making the region around the oxygen more negative than the areas around the two hydrogen atoms. The electrically positive portions of the molecule (the hydrogen atoms) are flexed away from the two filled orbitals of the oxygen. Basically, both hydrogen atoms are attracted to the same side of the oxygen atom, but they are as far apart from each other as they can be because the hydrogen atoms both carry a positive charge. The bent conformation is a balance between attraction and repulsion. \nRemember that even though the covalent bond between each hydrogen and oxygen in water is polar, a water molecule is an electrically neutral molecule overall. Each water molecule has 10 protons and 10 electrons, for a net charge of 0. Why Water Is a Polar Solvent \nThe shape of each water molecule influences the way it interacts with other water molecules and with other substances. Water acts as a polar solvent because it can be attracted to either the positive or negative electrical charge on a solute. The slight negative charge near the oxygen atom attracts nearby hydrogen atoms from water or positive-charged regions of other molecules. The slightly positive hydrogen side of each water molecule attracts other oxygen atoms and negatively-charged regions of other molecules. The hydrogen bond between hydrogen of one water molecule and oxygen of another holds water together and gives it interesting properties, yet hydrogen bonds are not as strong as covalent bonds. While the water molecules are attracted to each other via hydrogen bonding, about 20% of them are free at any given time to interact with other chemical species. This interaction is hydration or dissolving.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:48:51.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
