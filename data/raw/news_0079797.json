External Link: Little Ripper drone on facebook \nThe State Government partnered with Surf Life Saving NSW and The Ripper Group to trial the drones at beaches across the state and develop the training program. \nAustralia's first astronaut, Dr Paul Scully-Power, helped establish the project and said the training school would equip lifeguards to use the technology. \n\"If a lifeguard sees someone in an emergency, we can fly one of these UAVs or drones out there, we can talk to them, drop them a life support package, a life raft,\" he said. \n\"The other application is to patrol just beyond the surf line to see if there are any sharks.\" \nSix volunteer surf lifesavers and six full-time lifeguards have already been trained at the drone pilot training academy, which is based in Port Macquarie's Surf Life Saving NSW administration building. \nAmong the early graduates was Australia's first woman lifesaver drone pilot and local resident, Toni Hurckett. \nShe said the drones offered endless opportunities to lifeguards. \n\"It's just going to open up a whole new world with ways that we can perform rescues and save lives, from quicker access to patients to better emergency response times,\" she said. \n\"You can use it to offer safety packs and rescue packs to patients in trouble, or just for general beach surveillance.\" Offering high school drone training program \nPresident of Surf Life Saving NSW David Murray said the technology had already helped save lives and would be very valuable moving forward. \n\"Our young people and visitors to Australia are often coming to our beaches in national parks which are not patrolled,\" he said. \n\"So, we really aren't in a position to cover all bases with humans [but] we can use these wonderful UAVs to do it.\" \nKevin Weldon, chairman of the Little Ripper Group, said the academy had also started a drone pilot training program for high school students, with the first classes being run in Queensland at the Southport School. \nHe said there would be different levels and school students would be able to upgrade to full drone pilot qualifications at the Port Macquarie academy. \n\"I think this year we'll have 500 people through the academy [and] that's just the adults,\" Mr Weldon said. \n\"In the schools, we'll be training them in the junior high school and senior high school at different levels.\" Career options for those with mobility restrictions \nDaniel Trollope, based on the Gold Coast, is the first wheelchair lifesaver drone pilot to graduate from the training academy. \nHe said the drone technology had opened up new career paths for people in wheelchairs. \n\"Obviously surf lifesaving, in its traditional form, is standing on a beach patrolling, looking and eventually running out and helping someone, so sitting in a wheelchair ... that isn't a movement you can join,\" Mr Trollope said. \n\"But with the UAV and the fact you can sit on the shore or on a headland and be part of the movement and assisting the community, that's a good thing.\" \nThe Little Ripper Training Academy also plans to offer other training for people with restricted mobility, including using drones for commercial applications, such as pipeline inspections or wind farm maintenance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T10:43:55.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
