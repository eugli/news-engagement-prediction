The indigenous people focused on economically valuable tree species, transforming the environment in the process to create a ‘prehistoric supermarket' Humans altered the bamboo forests for millennia, they say, creating small, temporary clearings to build these mysterious structures. The team collected soil samples from pits dug within and outside of the geoglyphs. Then, they analysed ‘phytoliths’ – a type of microscopic plant fossil made of silica. This allowed them to reconstruct the ancient vegetation and charcoal quantities, assess the amount of forest burning and carbon stable isotopes, and determine how ‘open’ the vegetation used to be. The investigation revealed that the indigenous people didn’t burn large tracts of forest, whether for geoglyph construction or agricultural practices. Instead, they concentrated on economically valuable tree species, such as palms, transforming their environment in the process to create a ‘prehistoric supermarket.’ The researchers reconstructed 6,000 years of vegetation and fire history around two of the geoglyph sites. Humans altered the bamboo forests for millennia, they say, creating small, temporary clearings to build these mysterious structures While little is known of their purpose, it’s thought that these ditched enclosures were once used sporadically as ritual gathering places. Their unusual geometric structure has been compared to Stonehenge, pictured And, the biodiversity of some of Acre’s remaining forests may have roots in these ancient ‘agroforestry’ practices, the researchers say. The findings will be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ‘Despite the huge number and density of geoglyph sites in the region, we can be certain that Acre’s forests were never cleared as extensively, or for as long, as they have been in recent years,’ Dr Watling said. ‘Our evidence that Amazonian forests have been managed by indigenous peoples long before European Contact should not be cited as justification for the destructive, unsustainable land-use practiced today. ‘It should instead serve to highlight the ingenuity of past subsistence regimes that did not lead to forest degradation, and the importance of indigenous knowledge for finding more sustainable land-use alternatives.’ The Stonehenge-like ditches take up roughly 8,078 square miles (13,000 square kilometers) Acre state, in the western Brazilian Amazon Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:47:18.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
