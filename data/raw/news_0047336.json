The boy turns around and continues making the sound, with the delight clear on his face. Zachary's mother, Laki Baker, told Daily Mail Australia his obsession began with a visit to Perth Zoo a year and a half ago. Can't stop won't stop: The young boy added dinosaur movements to his roaring, evident in his hunched back and Tyrannosaurus Rex arms 'They had dinosaur exhibition on and he was fascinated by them,' she explained. 'We went to the zoo quite regularly, but he didn't want to see the animals, he just wanted to see the dinosaurs. 'The exhibition lasted about six months, and he just loved it.' From there, his love for the ancient creature only grew. Zach only wanted dinosaur toys, and he began to, in his own way, study them extensively. 'He's so intrigued and curious about dinosaurs, everything he watches on television or on the iPad is dinosaur related,' Mrs Baker said. Obsessed: Zach discovered the ancient creatures during a visit to the dinosaur exhibition at Perth Zoo (pictured) 'But it's really educational things, like BBC videos about what they do and eat. 'He can tell you if a dinosaur is an omnivore or a herbivore or a carnivore, he knows all the different names of dinosaurs.' Customers of the toddler's local supermarket will likely know him as the boy who moves through the aisles with dinosaur hands, roaring at people. Happy birthday: Zachary's elaborate third birthday cake was dinosaur themed Solving problems: Zach had eating issues, but began to overcome them when his mother Laki started cutting his food into dinosaur shapes Delicious! Mrs Baker says her son was tube fed for the first few weeks of his life, but has started to eat much better now he can enjoy dinosaur-shaped food Zach's obsession has its perks though. His mother says it has been instrumental in helping to solve his eating issues. 'He was a premature baby who was tube fed for the first few weeks of his life, and he has never been a big eater,' Mrs Baker explained. 'Part of trying to get him to eat has been the use of dinosaur shaped cookie cutters and making everything into dinosaur shapes, and he eats so much better now!' As anyone would, Mrs Baker admits sometimes the roaring gets too much to bear. 'He makes that sound all day - I have to say to him on a very regular basis \"Zachary, no more roaring\" and he'll be like \"Mummy, I just want to roar!\",' she laughed. 'But he's learning something so it can't be that bad!'
