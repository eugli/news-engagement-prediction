Alameda County sheriff's Deputy Michael Foley died Thursday after he was struck by a jail transport bus. (Alameda County Sheriff's Office) Veronica Rocha Thursday.\nThe accident occurred about 6 a.m. as the bus was leaving the jail to pick up bagged lunches for inmates, Sheriff Gregory Ahern said at a news conference Wednesday. \nFoley, 60, was walked through the parking lot when he was struck by the bus, which was traveling about 15 mph, he said. \nThe driver did not see Foley, Ahern said. \n“At 6 o’clock in the morning, the parking lot is extremely dark and the asphalt, which is dark, is covered with water from the recent rains and the deputy, who was struck, was wearing dark, navy blue clothing,” he said. \nAfter the accident, Ahern said he met with Foley’s family and talk to fellow deputies. \nHe said the driver, who is also a deputy, was “heartbroken.” \n“I told him, ‘This won’t be done and over with this afternoon and won’t be done and over with tomorrow,’” Ahern said. “This is going to be a lasting effect on him and our agency as well.” \nThe sheriff said Foley was one of the hardest working deputies and often volunteered to work overtime. In a statement on Facebook, the sheriff’s office said Thursday that Foley mentored “countless numbers of young officers throughout his career.” \n“All of us who were touched by his life will never forget him,” the sheriff’s office said. “He is a role model and a great example for others to follow. Our hearts are broken today.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss \nPresident Trump has withdrawn protections for transgender students .
