Got it The school district in Cleveland, Miss., has reached a settlement with the federal government after appealing a judge’s order to desegregate its high schools and middle schools, ending a five-decade legal battle over integrating black and white students. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) By Emma Brown and Wesley Lowery By Emma Brown and Wesley Lowery January 31 at 5:33 PM Follow @emmersbrown Follow @WesleyLowery \nA Mississippi school district has dropped its challenge to the court-ordered desegregation of its middle and high schools, ending a 50-year legal battle over the segregation of black and white students. \nThe Cleveland School District’s board announced Monday that it had reached a settlement with the Justice Department and private plaintiffs in the long-running case. \nJamie Jacks, a lawyer for the school board, said board members voted unanimously to drop their challenge to offer the community clarity about the future. They felt “moving forward with a solid plan would serve the District, its students, faculty, parents and the community best in the long run,” Jacks said. \nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Zakiya Summers-Harlee, director of communications and advocacy for the ACLU of Mississippi, welcomed the move. “It’s taken way too long…but we’re looking forward to the full desegregation of these schools, which will take away the idea that if you’re from one side of the tracks you’re less than those from the other,” she said. \nCleveland is a town of 12,000 people and home to two high schools — one on the historically white side of town, whose students are evenly split between black and white students, and the other a mile away on the historically black side of town, with a student population that is almost exclusively black. There are two middle schools with similar racial breakdowns.

The two middle schools would also be consolidated into one. Both of the new schools were to open in fall 2017. The order drew cheers from some in Cleveland, who felt that children would have access to more opportunities in one larger school. But for others, including black and white alumni of both high schools, consolidation was synonymous with loss — loss of tradition and identity associated with their alma maters. \nThe school district argued that its open-enrollment policy — which allowed families to choose where to send their children — had more successfully integrated schools than the involuntary measures common across the South over the past half century. The school board vowed to fight the ruling and appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
