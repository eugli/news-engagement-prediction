Too many Israel Apartheid Weeks very quickly morph into anti-Semitic activity, violent activity and discrimination against Jewish students Baroness Ruth Deech \n“This will include events such as those that might take place under the banner of ‘Israel Apartheid’ events for instance. Such events need to be properly handled by higher education institutions to ensure that our values, expectations and laws are not violated.” \nI AW is a series of events that seek to raise awareness about \"Israel’s settler-colonial project and apartheid system over the Palestinian people\", as well as encouraging the movement to boycott Israel. \nEvents run under the IAW banner have courted controversy in the past. The co-chair of Oxford University’s Labour Club resigned in protest at its “problem with Jews” following its decision to endorse IAW last year.
