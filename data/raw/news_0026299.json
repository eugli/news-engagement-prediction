PHOTO | DAVID KWALIMWA By DAVID KWALIMWA \nMidfield powerhouse Khalid Aucho has ruled out an immediate return to the SportPesa Premier League. \nThe former Gor Mahia midfielder is currently a free agent after officially parting ways with South African club Baroka FC. \nClub owner Khurishi Mphaphlele has confirmed Aucho’s departure from the newly promoted club. \nThe Ugandan player was released alongside compatriot Geoffrey Massa barely seven months into their respective two year contracts. \nMphaphlele told Kick off : “We have parted ways with those two players and it was a mutual separation. They now have their clearances and are free.” \nNairobi News had last month exclusively revealed that the player was unsettled at Baroka. \nAt the time, during an interview with him at the African Cup of Nation in Gabon, the player also confirmed that he had lots of offers on the table. \nHe said: “it looks like the coach doesn’t trust me, or maybe he wants to reward the players who helped him get promotion (to the top flight). I don’t want to sit on the bench.” \nHe added: “See, I have several offers already and will be seeking to leave. Returning to Kenya? At the moment no, thanks. Zambia? Maybe, I need a fresh challenge.” \nThe left footed midfielder is said to have also attracted interest from clubs in Vietnam, Israel and Zambia.
