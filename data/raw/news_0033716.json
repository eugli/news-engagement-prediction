(Photo: Kaila White) \n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE About 200 supporters gathered Saturday afternoon in support of Phoenix's Muslim community.\nSome stood outside socializing as a man played guitar and sang. Many removed their shoes and went inside the mosque, where children marveled at the five large chandeliers and the plush carpet designed with sections to pray.\nThe Rally in Solidarity With the Muslim Community was scheduled for 1 to 4 p.m. at the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix, 516 N. Black Canyon Highway.\nThe event was in response to President Donald Trump's executive order that temporarily banned citizens of seven majority Muslim nations from entering the United States, temporarily suspended the entry of all refugees and required an indefinite stop on refugees from Syria. The ban is on hold while courts weigh its constitutionality.\nValley high school students, most from the Arizona School for the Arts in Phoenix, worked with the mosque to organize the event.\n\"In light of Trump's discriminatory and Islamophobic rhetoric and legislature, we are joining together in a peaceful demonstration of our support for the mosques of Phoenix,\" the Facebook event description says.\nPeople sat on the ground inside the mosque to hear a presentation from ICCP president Usama Shami, who spoke about Islam and its misconceptions. Shami is an engineer and teaches math at Glendale Community College, he said, joking that he would give a quiz at the end of the presentation.\nMultiple people from the Phoenix Police Department's community response bureau stood outside, monitoring a handful of protesters who lined the streets and yelled into megaphones.\nA handful of protesters sit across the street from a rally in solidarity with the Muslim community.
