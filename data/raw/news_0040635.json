Eataly, the giant Italian marketplace that's co-owned by Mario Batali , will soon be getting a new rooftop restaurant at its Boston location. The new eatery, called Terra, will feature \"a wood fire grill and regional Italian-inspired dishes,\" according to a job posting on BostonChefs.com. 72 photos The entrance to Eataly Boston on Boylston Street. \"The menu will showcase a number of specialty Italian items sourced from their downstairs market including dry aged meats and the freshest seafood available, house made pasta and seasonal specials featuring local products,\" according to the posting. \"While Terra still follows the Eataly ideology, foundation and passion for Italian cuisine, it incorporates the grill theme into almost every dish. They are a from-scratch kitchen focusing on whole animal butchering, house-made sausages and charcuterie.\" Take a tour of Eataly's Boston location in our slideshow above. Dan Bazzinotti , formerly of Cambridge's Bisq, Bergamot in Somerville and Lydia Shire's Scampo in Boston, will serve as the chef de cuisine at Terra. The 45,000-square-foot, three-story Eataly at Boston's Prudential Center includes an outpost of the Naples, Italy-based Neopolitan pizza maker Rossopomodoro as well as restaurants La Pizza & La Pasta, Il Pesce and La Pizza. An Eataly spokeswoman did not immediately return an email seeking comment. The news was first reported on the restaurant blog Boston Restaurant Talk.
