Members of the RBB unfurled the offensive banner during Saturday’s Sydney derby. Source: Supplied \nIt’s understood that Sydney FC have told Football Federation Australia that they believe the banner was targeted at Arnold, and that he deserves a formal apology from Western Sydney. Arnold is known to be furious at the banner, which was apparently produced to mark the Wanderers’ first win over the Sky Blues in more than three years. \nThe storm is likely to cost Western Sydney significantly, with A-League bosses believed to be considering a significant fine for such an explicit and public display. The match was bad tempered on the pitch as WSW ended Sydney’s unbeaten run. Source: News Corp Australia \nThe game was also marred by scuffles between supporters inside the stadium and out, with police making some 15 arrests. \nA Wanderers spokesman declined to comment, with club officials meeting on Monday afternoon to review the game and its fallout.
