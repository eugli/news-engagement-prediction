While football tattoos to honour your heroes may now be commonplace, few are as spectacular as this one. One Reds supporter in America, it appears, has covered their entire thigh with the face of Anfield star Adam Lallana. But that's not all - in a joke that will either make you laugh or groan, the England international has been transformed into a llama in the body art, and named 'Adam Lallama'. A Liverpool fan in America has had a bizarre tattoo done of Adam Lallana as a llama â€” Andreah (@letsunwindxx) February 7, 2017 The picture, which surfaced on twitter, appears to come from an American fans called Andreah, who tweeted it with the caption 'The pain is worth it to show my love for #AdamLallana and @LFC'. Lallana himself, who joined the club from Southampton in 2014, has been in fine form as Liverpool mounted a title challenge this season. But the club have fallen off the pace since the turn of the year, and Lallana said they need to learn from Chelsea, who look set to take the Premier League at a canter.
