If so, you probably said 'aww, thanks', appreciated the gesture - which is really all part of a clever advertising campaign - and then gobbled it up. \nWho can resist the lure of that lovely chocolate and caramel combo? Lynne Brooks, that's who. \nThe 51-year-old, from Stinchcombe, has kept a Rolo safe for a whopping 33 years after her boyfriend gave it to her as a Valentine's Day gift back in 1984. \nRichard braved heavy snow and freezing temperatures to deliver the gift, delicately wrapped as a sign of his love to his sweetheart along with a card and a bouquet of flowers. \nThe couple married in 1986 and now, 33 years and three children later, Lynne still to this day has the treasured chocolate stashed away in a box. She probably shouldn't eat it now... (Photo: Nestle) \nShe recalls: “We weren’t living together at the time, so Richard came up to my house before he went to work, to leave me a card, some flowers and his last Rolo. It was all wrapped up and I remember thinking I wouldn’t eat it, I thought I would keep it.” Richard and Lynne on their wedding day in 1986 (Photo: Nestle) \nRichard adds: “I left Lynne my last Rolo as an expression of love, because as the slogan suggests, I loved her enough to give her my last Rolo.” \nFor the past 33 years, Lynne has kept Richard’s last Rolo in a small wooden box and admits it has become quite a talking point with friends, family and colleagues. Lynne has kept it protected in a small wooden box (Photo: Nestle) \nShe said: “Our kids think it is mad and everyone at work thinks it is a little bit crazy to have kept it for this long. Sometimes I even take it into work around Valentine’s Day to show people it.” \nEven after 33 years together, the couple who celebrated their 30 th wedding anniversary last year still keep their romance alive by taking the time to celebrate Valentine’s Day.
