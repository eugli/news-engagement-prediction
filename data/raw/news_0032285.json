This only applies to short trips of under 4km in the Klang Valley, but there is no set time of day for claiming the promo – this includes times when surge pricing would be in effect. More importantly, there is no promo code to be inserted to get the benefit. \nThere are some limitations to claiming the promo price. For one, using the cash option to pay for rides will cost RM1 instead; seeing that it would be impossible for the driver to make change. Secondly, regular Uber fare pricing will kick in should the driver encounter unusually heavy traffic. \nUber has not provided an explanation for why it’s running this promotion, although it comes at a very convenient time. Anyone looking for a cheap chauffeur for short trips during St. Valentine’s Day should probably look into this sort of thing. Although the distance limitations may reduce the application of this promo. The offer runs from today until 26 February 2017.
