Today we have created history,” said project director B. Jayakumar. ARUN SANKAR via Getty Images The Indian Space Research Organisation Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle was launched into space on Wednesday. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his congratulations on the launch conducted by the state-run Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) that went off smoothly and was carried live on national TV news channels. Congratulations to @isro for the successful launch of PSLV-C37 and CARTOSAT satellite together with 103 nano satellites! — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 15, 2017 This remarkable feat by @isro is yet another proud moment for our space scientific community and the nation. India salutes our scientists. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 15, 2017 Spoke to the Secretary, Department of Space and congratulated him & the entire team of scientists on today's exceptional achievement. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 15, 2017 \n“This remarkable feat by ISRO is yet another proud moment for our space scientific community and the nation,” he said. “India salutes our scientists.” \nModi is bullish on India’s space program and has repeatedly praised the efforts of scientists who three years ago pulled off a low-cost mission to send a probe to orbit Mars that succeeded at the first attempt. \nISRO’s low prices attracted international customers to launch 75 satellites last year from Sriharikota in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. \nThe launch of PSLV-C37 in a single payload, including the Cartosat-2 series and 103 co-passenger satellites, together weighed over 650 kg (1,433 lb) \nOut of 101 nano satellites, 96 were from the United States and one each from Israel, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
