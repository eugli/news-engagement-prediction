His family had emigrated to the United States from Saudi Arabia when he was 3 years old, and is in the first generation of his family to attend college. In addition to the usual adjustments to campus life that most freshman face, Alsemeiry struggled to get his bearings in an unfamiliar culture. \n“Everyone here seemed to have a sense of direction — to know where they’re going and what they want to get out of college,” says Alsemeiry. “I came from a large public high school with not a lot of resources or academic rigor.” It wasn’t until the first semester of his sophomore year before he felt truly at home, he says. \nNearly 400 first-generation students like Alsemeiry are coming to Yale Friday-Sunday, Feb. 24-26 to discuss their common challenges and ways to overcome them at the third annual 1vyG Conference . Alsemeiry and Laura Plata ’19 are co-chairing the event, which will bring together first-generation, high-achieving, low-income students from the 19 top U.S. colleges and universities, including all of the Ivy League schools, Stanford, and MIT — including 25 delegates from Yale. \nThe annual conference is presented by the Inter-Ivy, First-Generation College Student Network (1vyG), a network of students and administrators aimed at building best practices and advocating for institutional change to increase first-generation students’ chances at success in both their academic and professional careers. The first conference was held at Brown; the second at Harvard, where Plata and Alsemeiry were delegates. \nAlsemeiry’s experience is not unique among students who are the first in their families to attend college. “First-generation college students experience college differently than their non-first-gen student peers,” reads the 1vyG website. “While students whose parents have a college education tend to experience ‘college as a continuation’ of their academic and social experiences in high school, going to college often constitutes a ‘disjunction’ in the lives of first-generation students and their families. As a result, first-generation students have to make much more complex academic, social, and cultural transitions to college life, especially during the crucial first year. \nThe conference will offer opportunities for participants to share their experiences as first-generation students, including a student-alumni networking lunch, where graduates of 18 colleges and universities will share their life and career experiences. Other highlights will include a panel with psychologists Mesmin Destin and Jennifer Richeson designed to empower students to detect, reason through, and confront different forms of inequality in their lives, and a career panel focusing, in part, on how first-generation students can navigate their identities in the workplace. Representatives from for-profit and non-profit organizations will also be on hand to discuss career opportunities. \n“One of the biggest hurdles as a first-generation student is that you don’t have a lot of knowledge about the professional world,” says Alsemeiry, who is also co-chairing the conference’s finance committee, which raised over $155,000 and received sponsorship from companies like Google, McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, Bain Capital, DE Shaw, Teach for America, and more. \nIn addition, administrators from colleges across the country will discuss the programs that they offer to help first-generation students get the most out of their college experience. Yale President Peter Salovey and Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions at Yale College, will be among the featured speakers. \nWhile most of the conference is open only to registered students, two events are open to the public: The keynote address on Saturday by Michael McCullough, co-founder and president of the Quest Scholars Program ( QuestBridge ), a nonprofit organization that helps identify high-achieving, low-income students and connects them with universities that provide generous need-based financial aid. (This year Yale admitted 48 students through the Questbridge National College Match Application.) McCullough’s talk will take place 11 a.m.-noon in Woolsey Hall, corner of College and Grove streets. Closing remarks on Sunday by Elizabeth Lee, assistant professor of sociology at Ohio University, whose primary area of research is the social experiences of college students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds. Lee’s talk will take place at 2 p.m. in Woolsey Hall. \nThe ultimate goal of the 1vyG conference is to raise awareness of the challenges faced by first-generation students and “to provide people with the information and tools to organize and push for more acceptance of this community at top colleges,” says Alsemeiry. \nThe Yale sophomore — who is now a campus tour guide and economics tutor and helps run a peer liaison group for low-income students in Yale College — is majoring in Economics and Global Affairs, and a scholar in the Multidisciplinary Program in Human Rights. In the future, he says, he wants to continue to work to improve access to education on a global scale, thereby breaking a cycle that “perpetuates poverty and inequality.” Contact Office of Public Affairs & Communications 203-432-1345", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:54:54.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
