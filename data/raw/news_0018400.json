But I always knew that women’s boxing, at least professionally, needed me.” \nCo-manager Mark Taffet said, “Claressa is on a mission to be a game changer, to chart a new course in history. She is proud to be the first woman to headline a main event on premium television, and she intends to be the first woman to be ranked in boxing’s top 10 pound-for-pound list. The journey begins March 10.” \nShields is thrilled to be fighting so close to her hometown. \n“This is great. I get to be, once again, the good news for my hometown and for Michigan,” Shields said. “I haven’t fought this close to home in years. I fight abroad. Rio, London, China, Kazakhstan, but I’m finally getting a chance for all my family and friends to come out.” \nShields, 21, is the only U.S. boxer, male or female, to win two gold medals in the Olympics, in 2012 and 2016. She won her first gold at 17, and she is fighting for the NABF title, which is important to Shields because it was a title that her idol, Muhammad Ali, won early in his career. \n“I’ve always said Muhammad Ali is the greatest. He’s the Golden Butterfly and I’m the silver Butterfly,” Shields said. \nShoBox analyst Steve Farhood says women’s boxing in the U.S. has its best chance of a revival because of the emergence of Shields. \n“Women’s boxing is pretty big in certain countries, but it really hasn’t been a factor in the United States since Laila Ali and, before her, Christy Martin,” said Farhood. “Being the only U.S. boxer to win two gold medals, Claressa has instant credibility and star appeal and those two things are going to lead to wide exposure.” \nSzabados (15-8, 6 KOs) challenged for a world title in July of 2015 in her ninth pro fight, losing a decision to undefeated WBC super middleweight champion Nikki Adler in Germany. The native of Miskolc, Hungary, has won by knockout in three of her last five victories. \n“Fighters always say their next fight is the most important one of their career, but you get an opportunity like this, and it really is,” Szabados said. “This is an unbelievable dream. I am very happy to be receiving this opportunity. I know this fight is important for Claressa also, and I don’t really know what will happen in the ring. We both want to win. Claressa has more amateur experience, but I have more experience as a professional. It’s going to be an exciting night.” \nShields will fight for the first time under her old coach, Jason Crutchfield, who handled her through a good portion of her amateur career, including London in 2012. \n“We didn’t work together for more than two years,” she said. “We always stayed in contact. He is the coach that knows me the best. He can get 14 rounds out of me when I only got six. He knows how to push me and pull something out of me. We’re so close that before he calls out for me to do something, I’m already doing it.” \nShields confidently believes she will go down as the greatest female boxer of all time. \n“I think I’m getting close to my goal of being the best woman to put on a pair of gloves,” she said. “The best woman fighter with the best skills, the most power, so they won’t have to question, is it Laila Ali, is it Christy Martin, is it Lucia Rijker? Hands down it will be Claressa Shields.” \n(Photo of Claressa Shields, right, throwing a right at Franchon Crews in the second round of their super middleweight bout at T-Mobile Arena last Nov. 19, by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:00:50.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
