We maintain that there is nothing new on that front,\" he said.\n\"There are a lot of ideas that are being floated out. I mentioned this the last couple days. But that doesn't mean -- part of it is as the President does all the time, he asks for input, he asks for ideas, and on a variety of subjects, there are staffing procedures that go on where people have a thought or an idea and it goes through the process,\" he said.\n\"But until the President makes up his mind and gives feedback and decides that that's final, there's nothing to announce,\" Spicer said in response to a question.\n\"We have freedom of religion in this country, and I think people should be able to practice their religion, express their religion, express areas of their faith without reprisal. And I think that pendulum sometimes swings the other way in the name of political correctness,\" Spicer told reporters at his daily news conference.\nTrump had last week signed a controversial executive order to suspend the arrival of refugees and impose tough new controls on travellers from Iran , Iraq, Libya , Somalia, Syria and Yemen, as part of new measures to \"keep radical Islamic terrorists\" out of America.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:32:43.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
