We regret the error.\"\nThe tweet had appeared to be a consequence of early police reports in the wake of the shooting that said two suspects had been taken into custody. Later reports said one of those people was not a suspect, but a witness.\nPurchase noted the tweet appeared early Monday afternoon, but remained online even after police had confirmed that the sole suspect, Alexandre Bissonnette, is a 27-year-old man of French-Canadian origin.\nBefore it was deleted Tuesday evening, the tweet had been retweeted more than 900 times, and liked about 1,600 times. It also had about 7,200 replies, many of them pointing out the inaccuracy and calling for a correction.\nA subsequent tweet posted Monday evening noting the second person in custody had been cleared was retweeted only 72 times and had 162 likes.\nThe PMO's interest in the earlier, incorrect tweet may have a lot to do with the fact that it also includes an image of Trudeau and his quote from the night of the shooting: \"We condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge.\"\nIt also links to a story published on the Fox News website that includes the updated information and notes that the earlier detail about a second suspect came from other media reports.\nThe PMO would not comment further on the letter, but confirmed it did not send any similar letters to other media outlets that had reported -- and since corrected or otherwise updated -- similar earlier misinformation.\nAs of Tuesday evening, a tweet from Montreal newspaper La Presse that also described one of the suspects as Moroccan had also not been deleted. That one had been retweeted more than 500 times and liked nearly 300 times.\nPurchase ended her letter by asking Fox News to either retract or update the tweet, but not before delivering a broader message that was likely intended for an audience much bigger than its named recipient.\n\"We need to remain focused on keeping our communities safe and united instead of trying to build walls and scapegoat communities,\" she wrote.\nNor was the phrase about building walls the only veiled reference to U.S. President Donald Trump and his controversial comments and policies on immigration.\n\"Ramping up fear and closing our borders is not a solution,\" Purchase wrote. \"It distracts from the real issues that affect people's day-to-day life.\"\nPhotos A Fox News tweet incorrectly describing the suspect in the Quebec City mosque attack as being Moroccan is pictured.
