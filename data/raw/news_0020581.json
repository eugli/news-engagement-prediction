Panneerselvam on Wednesday claimed he was never allowed to meet late chief minister J. Jayalalithaa even once when she was hospitalised in the Apollo Hospitals. \n\"I went to Apollo for all 75 days, but never allowed to meet Amma even once,\" he said. \nIn a rather shocking turn of events, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam's (AIADMK) leader of legislative party VK Sasikala has removed the incumbent Chief Minister from the post of the party's treasurer after he openly revolted at the memorial of J. Jayalalithaa and said that he was forced to resign from the post. \nRead: #ISupportOPS say adoring twitterati; adulatory memes flow \nThe AIADMK General Secretary Sasikala said blamed DMK for Panneerselvam's action citing the bonhomie between him and DMK's Working President M.K.Stalin in the Assembly. \nMoments after she addressed the media outside her Poes Garden residence and said the party will 'surely' remove O. Pannerselvam from all positions in the party, the incumbent Chief Minister hit back and said nobody can take the post of treasurer from him as he was appointed by late J. Jayalalithaa ten years back. \n\"I was appointed as treasurer of the party by Amma 10 years ago. No one has the right to remove me from that post,\" Pannerselvam took to Twitter to express his point of view. \n\"My future course of action will reflect the mindset of the people and AIADMK cadre,\" he added.
