Each time, Netanyahu looked Trump in the eye.\nWith their wives and staff members in the audience, each man said the other’s country had no better ally than his country.\nTrump, who took office on Jan. 20, then caught Netanyahu off-guard, at one point saying that if a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was going to be reached, “Both sides will have to make compromises.”\nTurning to Netanyahu, he said, “You know that, right?”\nNetanyahu looked momentarily startled and replied, chuckling, “Both sides.”\nTrump turned to Netanyahu while responding to a question about settlements, a particular point of tension during the Obama years, and said, “I’d like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit.”\nAgain, Netanyahu’s face registered surprise before he offered an ironic smile.\nTrump offered no new prescription for achieving a peace that has eluded many of his predecessors.\nTrump, who appointed his son-in-law Jared Kushner as his special adviser on the Middle East, said, “I think we’re going to make a deal, it might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand. That’s a possibility. So let’s see what we do.”\n“Let’s try,” Netanyahu said.\nTrump, who made a point of saying they were old friends, responded, “That doesn’t sound too optimistic, but he’s a good negotiator.”\nIn a play on the title of Trump’s 1987 best-selling book, Netanyahu responded, “That’s the art of the deal.”\nNear the end of his comments, Netanyahu sought to show how well he knows Kushner, whose father, Charles Kushner, has donated generously to Israeli causes.\n\"Can I reveal, Jared, how long we’ve known you?\" said Netanyahu, looking to Jared Kushner, 36, who was sitting in the front row.\n\"Well, he was never small. He was always big. He was always tall,\" Netanyahu said, implying he had known Kushner since he was a baby.\n(Editing by Howard Goller and Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:05:49.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
