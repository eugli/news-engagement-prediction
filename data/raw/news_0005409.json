Australia \nA 25-minute phone call between Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull reportedly got heated last weekend on the topic of refugees . \nTrump reportedly blasted Turnbull over an agreement that was in place under president Obama for the U.S. to accept 1,250 refugees from a detainment centre in the South Pacific, The Washington Post reported. \n“This is the worst deal ever,” Trump reportedly said. \nTrump is also said to have accused Turnbull of trying to send the U.S. “the next Boston bombers.” \nHe then told Turnbull that of the multiple calls he’d had with world leaders that day, it was the “worst call by far.” \nAustralian government officials told the country’s ABC network that the Post’s story was “substantially accurate.” Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 \nTrump took to Twitter and called the deal for the U.S. to accept the refugees “dumb.” \nOn Thursday White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer rebuked reports of tension among the leaders, calling Trump and Turnbull’s conversation “cordial.” Raw video: Trump chats with President Putin on phone White House describes Trump’s call with Australian PM as ‘cordial’ Germany \nIn interviews with Germany’s Bild and the Times of Londo n days before inauguration , Trump criticized Germany for its refugee policy amid the migrant crisis and suggested German Chancellor Angela Merkel was to blame for the Brexit result. \nHe has also taken aim at German car-maker BMW, and voiced concerns there are too many German cars on American roads. \nOn Tuesday, Trump adviser Peter Navarro told the Financial Times that Germany “continues to exploit other countries in the E.U. as well as the U.S. with an ‘implicit Deutsche Mark’ that is grossly undervalued.” \nCOMPLETE COVERAGE: Global News political headlines \nMerkel promptly fired back that Germany was not manipulating the Euro. \nMeanwhile, German transatlantic coordinator Juergen Hardt said on Thursday that officials have had to spend time with their new U.S. counterparts explaining how the European Union works, Reuters reports. \n“My impression is that the knowledge about the way the EU works is not very pronounced — at least not in Trump’s inner circle,” Juergen Hardt noted. \nAlso this week, European Council President Donald Tusk warned E.U. leaders that the new U.S. administration was putting the union into a “difficult situation,” putting “into question the last 70 years of American foreign policy.” Mexico \nIn Trump’s first week in office, he signed an executive order approving a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. In a tweet, Trump said if Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto refuses to pay for the wall, he should cancel his planned trip to Washington. \nShortly after, Pena Nieto did just that . \nWATCH: Mexico president cancels U.S. visit after Trump wall comments \nFollowing the cancellation, Trump’s spokesman said the White House would seek to pay for the border wall by slapping a 20 per cent tax on all imports from Mexico, as well as on other countries the U.S. has a trade deficit with. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump voters love that he’s going to build the wall with Mexico \nOn Friday, Trump reportedly threatened Pena Nieto in a phone call to send U.S. troops to stop “bad hombres down there” unless the Mexican military does more to control them, according to an excerpt of a transcript of the conversation obtained by The Associated Press. China \nTrump has long accused China of destroying the U.S. economy, and threats of a trade war continue to loom as we wait and see what, if any punitive tariffs will be imposed on China. \nIn early December Trump raised the ire of Chinese officials — and broke protocol — by taking a call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. \nWATCH: Trump breaks US policy with Taiwan call ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:06:45.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
