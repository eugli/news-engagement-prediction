SHARE Barack Obama is on holidays in the British Virgin Islands. Photo: Twitter \nPaparazzi photos taken earlier this week show the former president dressed in a black Nike polo shirt, casual black shorts, thongs, sunglasses and - as social media users have taken great delight in - a black baseball cap, worn backwards. \nYes, like all of the cool kids in Year 4 who would risk melanoma on their nose (with an added tuck of the Legionnaires flap, if required), Obama has disregarded all effective hat-wearing advice, and Twitter users are loving it. I am not an undercover cop pic.twitter.com/VBXBtVETHT — Trill Withers (@TylerIAm) February 1, 2017 \nSome have joked that the backwards cap is indicative of Obama well and truly clocking off and handing in his badge.

Obama better come back from vacation with three dragons. — Neven Mrgan (@mrgan) January 29, 2017 \nOf course the hat has fulfilled its role perfectly in burying the real lede here: our BFF \"Michelle, girl of the South Side\" and that loveable old Barack are holidaying with Richard Branson on his private island. \nBranson has known the Obamas for quite sometime, infamously claiming to have asked Barack for a \"spliff\" at a White House dinner in 2012, and meeting with the president last year to discuss not-for-profit initiatives. \nThis is not a case of Richo saying, \"Look, I know you've got to have a bit of security in place for your post-inauguration wind-down. My private island is free in early Feb, do you want the keys? Bin night on Tuesdays.\" They are definitely holidaying together. \nThey arrived on his private jet. \nThey are talking happily with hisdaughter. \nThey have both signed up for Virgin Galactic. (This may be an alternative fact.) \nIt's unclear exactly why viewing the Obamas lapping up such luxury is so surprising: the former First Family were both corporate lawyers who lived in a very nice part of Chicago and whose kids attended a school which cost $51,000 a year. More importantly, they are also, you know, a former First Family, which probably does wonders for your social circle. \nBut there's just something about seeing the Obamas holiday on the private island of a man worth $6.5 billion that kind of makes you feel... \nOh forget it. \nHey, everyone, look at Obama's hat!
