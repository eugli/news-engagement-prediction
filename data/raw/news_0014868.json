They include A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith, Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Díaz, The Sellout by Paul Beatty and Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates. \nNew Yorkers can vote for the title they think should be the first read and the city has enlisted the help of five celebrities on campaign on the behalf of their favorite books. \nDanielle Brooks, who plays Taystee in \"Orange Is the New Black\" and starred in the revival of \"The Color Purple\" on Broadway, is hoping Coates is the author NYC selects. \n\"My pick is near and dear to my heart,\" she says in a video . \" Between the World and Me is relevant now more than ever before!\" \nWilliam H. Macy's pick is the classic A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, published in 1943. \n\"My pick is the story of another family of low repute but with ambitions. Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn tells the story of Francie Nolan,\" he explains. \"They're all great books but in my opinion, it would be a shame if you didn't pick A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.\" \nThe voting period ends February 28 . \nWhile it may sound impossible, other major cities including Boston and Chicago, have successfully implemented similar programs. \nIn 2010, Boston launched \" One City One Story \" in collaboration with the Boston Book Festival. The all-city book club focuses on short stories that are available free of charge in hopes of \"spreading the joy of reading for pleasure among teens and adults … and to create a community around a shared reading experience.\" \nThe Windy City's \" One Book One Chicago \" program has been in operation since 2001.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:54:34.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
