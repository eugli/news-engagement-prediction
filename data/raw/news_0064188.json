Hawayo Takata , a Hawaii native of Japanese descent, brought her knowledge of Reiki to the mainland through oral teachings. She insisted that the teachings not be written down because of the powerful nature of Reiki could be misused if gotten into the wrong hands. Usui Reiki teachings and stories were passed down from teacher to student by word of mouth for several years. No wonder the stories got jumbled up! For the record, Mrs. Takata is widely respected in the Reiki community and is credited for introducing the world at large to the spiritual art called Reiki. But, research has proven that some of her teachings were inaccurate.< Reiki Myths Myth #1: Reiki is a Religion \nReiki absolutely is a spiritual art. The principle teachings of Reik i embrace a life of balance and promotes spiritual growth. But, Reiki is not a religion, nor is it based in any particular religious doctrine. Reiki does not infringe on anyone's beliefs or personal values. People of many different faiths have discovered the love-energies Reiki offers. Myth #2: Dr. Usui was a Christian Monk \nThe founder of the Usui System of Reiki, Dr. Mikao (Mikaomi) Usui, was not a monk, a Christian, or a medical doctor. He was a Japanese Zen Buddhist, a businessman, spiritualist, and scholar. Late in his life, he experienced a profound spiritual enlightenment after a period of fasting and meditation. Afterwards he began the process of developing the healing art of Reiki and opened a teaching clinic in Japan. Myth #3: Having a Reiki Attunement Will Open Up a Dialog with Your Spirit Guide \nAhhh... the lure to get a Reiki attunement with the promise of a glimpse into the spirit world. Please don't fall for this. This myth may have arisen out of the writings from Diane Stein. In her widely published book Essential Reiki , Diane describes how many of her students became aware of who their guides were after months of using Reiki following their level II attunements. The urban legend that followed was that the attunement alone would make this happen. Some Reiki II classes include a promise to \"Meet your Guides.\" Yes, it could happen and likely has happened for some Reiki initiates, but there is no guarantee. This promise could set you up for a big disappointment. Hoping for a meeting with your guides or angels should not be the sole reason for signing up to take a Reiki class. Myth #4: Reiki is a Massage Therapy \nReiki is NOT a massage therapy. Although there are many massage therapists who will incorporate the use of Reiki's healing energies into their massage sessions. Reiki is an energy-based therapy that does not involve manipulating bones or tissues. Reiki practitioners use a light touch with their hands on their clients' bodies or will hover their palms over them. Because it is not a massage, clothing is left on. Although, wearing loose-fitting garments is recommended for your comfort/relaxation. Myth #5: Giving Reiki to Others Depletes Your Own Energy. \nA Reiki practitioner does not give his personal energy over to the client. He serves as a channel, funneling Universal Life Energy through his body to the recipient. Much like the delivery boy delivering a package on your doorstep. The Reiki package is delivered, the delivery boy goes home fully intact. Ki energies are infinite and never run out. This does not mean that a person giving Reiki may not feel tired after giving a treatment to someone. This sometimes happens and Reiki has been wrongly blamed for it. If a person giving a treatment experiences exhaustion during or after applying Reiki to others, this is likely an indication that something is out-of-balance in his own body or life that needs attention. Booking a healing session for himself with another practitioner or conducting self-treatments would be warranted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:28:20.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
