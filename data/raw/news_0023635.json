The agency says that’s roughly 50 percent of the daily flights at the three airports. \nFlight cancellations in the New York metro area and other northeastern states began Wednesday as the storm approached the region. \nThe storm is expected to dump more than a foot of snow on some parts of the New York City area by the end of the day. The majority of flights have also been canceled at Philadelphia International Airport. \nThe National Weather Service predicted the city could see 8 to 12 inches of snow. Near whiteout conditions are also possible, with snow expected to fall at a clip of 2 to 4 inches per hour at the storm’s height. \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
