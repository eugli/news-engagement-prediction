Wamba the 11-year-old tortoise accepted a two-week-old bunny into her enclosure with a heat lamp outside of the Ritz-Carlton Dove Mountain in Marana, Arizona. The four-inch-long rabbit also had weeds tied around his neck. Ranger Brian discovered the bunny snuggled up to the tortoise on February 22 and helped remove the plants. A post on the Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain hotel Facebook page read: 'As the Ranger attempted to remove the bunny, so as to clear the plant debris from its neck, the tortoise became quite responsive to their actions, emitting grunts & groans in a clear demand for the gentle care of his newly found friend.'
