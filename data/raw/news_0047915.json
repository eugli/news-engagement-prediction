SEE ALSO: Nike shows it's no Under Armour with LeBron ad that slams discrimination \nYes, they are trying to sell shoes, but staking out positions on touchy subjects is noteworthy, and not without risks. The latest example is a new Nike video posted on the company's Middle East Twitter feed, which doubles down on its commitment to women achieving excellence and building leadership through sports. What will they say about you?Maybe they'll say you showed them what's possible. #justdoit pic.twitter.com/NZbQLC1JuB \nâ€” Nike Middle East (@NikeMiddleEast) February 18, 2017 \nShowing women running, doing parkour, ice skating, riding motorcycles and even boxing, all in what appear to be Middle Eastern settings, a voice-over says, \"What will they say about you?\" Along those lines, at one point, an older man looks on, seemingly disapprovingly, as a woman in a hijab skateboards through the middle of town. \nBut later in the video, the voice-over suggests, \"Maybe they'll say you're the next big thing.\" \nImage: nike middle east \nLooking at the comments on the tweet from the official Nike Middle East account , not everyone is happy with the video. However, there are enough positive comments attached to the tweet to indicate that Nike may have struck the right balance between suggesting an approach to its Middle Eastern customers regarding women in sports and simply saying \"just do it.\" \nEither way, love it or hate, it's another example of Nike running where other sports brands are too timid to tread.
