Now, the 70-year-old may spend the rest of his life in jail after he admitted to 45 child sex offenses. \nHauntingly, despite being a member of the Pedophile Information Exchange who campaigned in the ’70s and ’80s to lower the age of consent to 10 and legalize incest, he was still allowed to adopt a son in 1986. \nHe and his son are now estranged. \nFrost, whose real name is Andrew Tracey, abused boys in Sweden, France, Spain and Holland and after serving two short jail terms, moved to south-east Asia where his disgusting crimes continued. \nIn Thailand from 2008-2013, he lured poor boys to his home with food, money, computer games and his swimming pool. It was in his home where he would broadcast him raping and groping the boys on webcam to other pedophiles.

The offending involved exploiting the boys’ circumstances and backgrounds in order to take advantage of them and to sexually exploit them. He was a person who the children thought was friendly and generous. They went to his house to play computer games and swim — that was part of the draw. Then, he exploited that relationship. NCA The deputy director of the NCA’s CEOP Command, Andy Brennan, said, This has been a lengthy and complex investigation into a prolific child sex offender, who over many years believed he could sexually abuse children and evade law enforcement. The weight of evidence gathered by the investigating officers in this case was such that Frost pleaded guilty to over 40 charges. However, we suspect there could be many more victims of Frost, both male and female, who have never come forward or spoken to anybody about what happened to them. Police are hoping publicity of this man and his crimes will encourage other victims to step forward. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
