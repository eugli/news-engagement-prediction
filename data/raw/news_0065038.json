A new study has found the drug's damaging impacts on DNA can be passed on through sperm, hampering the fetus's brain development. Intriguingly, the effects were far more common in the sons of male cocaine users than their daughters, or than any child of a female cocaine user. While scientists are still trying to determine the timeline, this research builds on previous studies that show cocaine has a lingering effect on DNA, which can last for years after use. Male mice whose fathers took cocaine had issues with memory formation Senior author Dr R. Christopher Pierce, a professor of Neuroscience at the University of Pennsylvania, worked with a team to test the theory on mice. Sixteen male rates were allowed to self-administer cocaine daily through drinking water for 60 days. Another 16 drank saline solution. They then mated with females who had not taken drugs. Paternal cocaine-taking had no effect on the litter size, sex ratio, or growth development. However, out of the 46 total litters, the male babies which had been exposed to cocaine experienced significant issues with memory formation. Taking a closer look, they saw the expression of genes which are important for memory formation had been altered. Male rates whose fathers took cocaine had far lower levels of D-serine, a molecule essential for memory.
