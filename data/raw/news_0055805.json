Model Ethan Turnbull was one of the rescuers \nWriting on Instagram, Mr Turnbull said: “I had to make a decision to get in the middle of that or watch them drown. \n\"When I got about waist deep two of the kids jumped on top of me and pulled me under. \n“I had to pick them both up and throw them to Ethan. I then grabbed a ladder and pulled the next two in. Mr Turnball was skateboarding nearby when the kids fell through the ice \n\"Behind them were two lifeless bodies that I knew I couldn't get to. \n“I swam out and grabbed the last two guys and was able to get them to shore and keep them alive.” \nThe teenagers were all pulled to safety and treated for hypothermia, with one taken to hospital.
