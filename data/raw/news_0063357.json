With a name like that, your expectations might be a little high -- and no, Windows is not secretly invincible -- but the trick is awesome nevertheless. \n\"God Mode\" simply provides users with a centralized Control Panel for all of Windows' settings, from changing your desktop background to setting up a VPN or partitioning your hard drive. In all, there are nearly 50 categories and most have several entries. \nIt's almost comical how simple it is to access it. Simply, create a new folder -- anywhere is fine, I created one on my desktop -- and rename that folder to: \nGod Mode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}. \nThe \"God Mode\" chunk can be called anything you want. \nThe default folder icon will change to a Control Panel icon, and you can open it to view all of the settings. \nThe hack has been around for a while, and though there were some reports of crashes on Windows Vista 64-bit , for what it's worth I've successfully used it on Windows 7 Home, Ultimate 64-bit, and now Windows 10 Pro. \nAs an additional note, having the undocumented feature disclosed all over the web, Microsoft has decided to be more open about it admitting similar commands have been available in several versions of Windows. Additional \"God Modes\" \nThere are numerous other text strings that create similar \"God Mode\" folders, some have been deprecated, but as of time of writing these still work in Windows 10. You can also download a handy .zip file with all these folders already created. {17cd9488-1228-4b2f-88ce-4298e93e0966} â€“ Default Programs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:45:54.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
