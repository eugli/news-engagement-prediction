Well, installed in the centre console of the accused's vehicle was a DVD player and in a position that allowed the screen to be viewed by the driver of that vehicle. \n\"That DVD player was on and operating and was playing a wrestling DVD. \n\"On the prosecution case the accused drove his vehicle into the rear of the deceased's vehicle because he was not keeping a proper lookout on the road. \n\"Obviously the most likely explanation for this was he was distracted by the DVD player.\" Passenger required surgery for broken jaw \nThe court heard Franklin was driving to Adelaide from Roxby Downs where he had been working as a security guard and had two passengers who had also been in Roxby Downs looking for employment opportunities in the security industry. \nMr Foundas told the jury both passengers were looking at their mobile phones at the time of the collision and heard Franklin talking about the wrestling DVD. \nThe court heard one of the passengers suffered facial injuries including a broken jaw which required surgery. \nMr Foundas said it was a clear stretch of highway and the intersection where the collision occurred could be seen from 310 metres away from Franklin's direction of travel. \n\"The prosecution case is if he was keeping a proper lookout he would have had ample opportunity to see Mr Spencer's vehicle in front of him waiting to turn right, he would've had ample opportunity to take the required evasive action,\" Mr Foundas said. \n\"If he had been paying proper attention with proper regard to the road he would not have collided with the rear of the vehicle.\" \nMr Foundas told the jury there was evidence Franklin was driving at up to 110km/h, which was the speed limit, before the collision. \nThe court heard the most contentious issue for the jury to decide would be whether the accused's \"grossly defective\" lookout amounted to dangerous driving under the law. \nThe trial continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:12:32.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
