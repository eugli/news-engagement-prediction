Welcome, then, to a match that some would have you think is all about a roof. It will, after a long discussion, a few mind games and far too much speculation, be open but good god what a sideshow. You don’t need me to tell you what history these two teams have and in recent times Wales v England has been a fixture with as much spark as at any time since the English first crossed the Severn for a game in 1882. \nAfter slumping for several years, England improved in 2009 and 2011. In the former year, Joe Worsley inspired them to a narrow defeat when those of us who went as England fans expected a hammering, before Toby Flood inspired the men in white to a narrow win in 2011. Then in 2013, England went to the then Millennium Stadium chasing the title and a grand slam and ... well, that hardly went to plan: Sam Warburton inspired Wales to a crushing 30-3 win that did for England’s title hopes on points difference and was surely a key factor in the Welsh No7 taking the Lions captaincy from Chris Robshaw, who didn’t even make it into the squad after being ground into the dirt. \nTwo years later, Jonathan Joseph ghosted past a clearly concussed George North to set up a win for England that surely exorcised those dragon-shaped demons and would stand Stuart Lancaster’s men in good stead for the next time they met in the World C- ah. \nNow England are on a roll and Wales, despite recent results being decent, don’t seem to have impressed many people. The bookies have Eddie Jones’s men down as heavy favourites to seal a 16 th win on the bounce, despite the unimpressive showing against France last Saturday. The thing is, they were hammered at the breakdown then and Jack Clifford, Maro Itoje and Nathan Hughes have all of four starts in the back row between them. Justin Tipuric, Warburton and Ross Moriarty are very quiet but surely confident of running riot and giving Leigh Halfpenny a host of chances. In England’s favour is the pair of James Haskell and Tom Wood on the bench, meaning that if they are within a score in the last 20 then they can be confident of finishing stronger even though Taulupe Faletau is back among the Welsh replacements after injury. \nThere are two changes for the Welsh at the time of writing, as they wait on the fitness of North and Dan Biggar. They are actually a better side when Sam Davies plays in place of the latter, so fans won’t be panicking too much right now; even if my Welsh flatmate has predicted England by 20, my call yesterday was Wales by four. As it is, Rob Evans and Tomas Francis come in from the bench, switching places with Nicky Evans and Samson Lee – the same switch that proved so pivotal in the win over Italy last Sunday. Aside from Clifford for Wood, England’s other change is bringing in Jack Nowell for Jonny May, who was poor last week. \nKick-off for this one is 4.50pm for some reason. Here are your teams. \nWales 15-Leigh Halfpenny, 14-George North, 13-Jonathan Davies, 12-Scott Williams, 11-Liam Williams, 10-Dan Biggar, 9-Rhys Webb; 1-Rob Evans, 2-Ken Owens, 3-Tomas Francis, 4-Jake Ball, 5-Alun Wyn Jones, 6-Sam Warburton, 7-Justin Tipuric; 8-Ross Moriarty. Replacements: 16-Scott Baldwin, 17-Nicky Smith, 18-Samson Lee, 19-Cory Hill, 20-Taulupe Faletau, 21-Gareth Davies, 22-Sam Davies, 23-Jamie Roberts. \nEngland 15-Mike Brown, 14-Jack Nowell, 13-Jonathan Joseph, 12-Owen Farrell, 11-Elliot Daly, 10-George Ford, 9-Ben Youngs; 1-Joe Marler, 2-Dylan Hartley (captain), 3-Dan Cole, 4-Joe Launchbury, 5-Courtney Lawes, 6-Maro Itoje, 7-Jack Clifford, 8-Nathan Hughes.
