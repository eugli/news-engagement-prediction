That was something that had never been written down, and it needed to be done,\" author Dr Tom Lewis said. \nDr Lewis was given rare access to Japanese military records to uncover details about 1,883 enemy flights over northern Australia during World War II. \n\"Using Japanese records you get a lot of exaggeration on both sides,\" he said. \n\"[Airmen said]: 'I went out and I shot down three blokes and I saw the smoke coming out of the aircraft,' and then you examine the mission and find none of their aircraft were shot down at all.\" \nDr Lewis said the Japanese lost 61 aircraft and 186 Japanese air crew. \nMost had their remains scattered across the waters and remote bushland in the north. \nDr Lewis said he was in part inspired to write the book for the family of the many Japanese aviators who suffered a lonely death a long way from home. \n\"We'll find more aircraft and more remains, some slight traces as time goes on [but] our ability to penetrate the bush and underwater is [improving] all the time,\" he said. \n\"Only this week I was identifying a portion of a Dutch bomber — it was an enormous war and it's scattered all over.\" \nDr Lewis said he believed only a relatively small portion of the WWII wreckages and remains in the north had been discovered because of the remote landscape. \nThe last enemy aircraft flight into Northern Territory airspace was in June 1944, and the last plane brought down in July of that year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:12:10.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
