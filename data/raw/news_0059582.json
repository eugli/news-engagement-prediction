Leonard Lance's turn. The New Jersey GOP lawmaker is holding his 41st town hall meeting Wednesday, at Raritan Valley Community College in Branchburg. Because of the unprecedented demand, he's holding a 42nd meeting Saturday at the same place, and is streaming both live at http://live.njvid.net/rvcc . \nThe lawmaker required advance reservations and limited attendees to 7th Congressional District residents. Some complained that they were closed out. \n\"I hope it is informational for me and constituents,\" Lance said. \nLawmakers dodge angry voters \nWhile the next congressional elections won't take place for another 21 months, the upheaval has the potential to shape the next Congress the way the Tea Party helped the GOP take back the House in 2010, sweeping out more moderate Republicans along the way. \nU.S. Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Reps. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Tom McClintock of California are among Republicans who faced hostile audiences at recent town hall meetings. \nThis comes after the Women's March on Washington that drew hundreds of thousands of protestors the day after President Donald Trump's inauguration . \n\"Republicans need to be paying attention and doing their best to understand the energy from the town halls,\" said Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of Inside Elections , a Washington-based publication that tracks congressional races. \n\"Anyone who tells you definitely that is this is or is not part of a movement, they're lying to you, I don't think anyone has completely diagnosed what's going on.\" \nOther New Jersey lawmakers, most notably Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-11th Dist.) and Chris Smith (R-4th Dist.), have faced demands from constituents for town halls. \nNew Jersey Citizen Action invited Smith to a meeting in Manalapan on Wednesday to discuss health care. NJ 11th for Change held a town hall in Boonton Tuesday without Frelinghuysen. \nBoth Lance, who represents one of just 23 congressional districts where voters elected a House Republican and supported Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and Frelinghuysen, who saw Trump carry his district with less than 50 percent, are on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's initial target list . \nSo is Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-3rd Dist.), who expressed concern during a recent tele-town hall that \"outside groups who are agitating\" are taking over such events. He's holding another tele-town hall on Wednesday as well. \n\"I'm responding to what I've seen all over the country,\" MacArthur said. \"It's not fair to constituents who want to be heard, not to put on a show. People have a right to talk to their representatives.\" \nIn-person town halls have turned into shouting matches, said former Rep. Michael Ferguson (R-7th Dist.). \n\"People would show up and they'd start yelling,\" Ferguson said. \"It turns into a political rally or food fight. That's not healthy for political discourse.\" \nEight years ago, Tea Party supporters filled town halls to oppose Obama's health care proposal, eventually helping to elect a House GOP majority committed to repealing the law. \nWith Trump on their side, congressional Republicans last month took the first steps toward repeal. A budget resolution drew just nine House GOP dissenters, including MacArthur . \nWith the Affordable Care Act still in place, 194,000 New Jersey residents gained coverage under Medicaid, 205,242 residents received tax subsidies to help buy insurance, and 211,881 seniors got extra help to buy prescription drugs, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \nRepublicans have yet to offer alternatives providing similar coverage. \n\"Any town hall they have, they will very quickly learn there are people who live and work in their districts and they are dependent on the health care they're receiving,\" said Emily Tisch Sussman, campaign director for the Center for American Progress Action Fund, the advocacy arm of the research group founded by John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman. \nSarah Dohl had a front-row seat to the Tea Party efforts as an aide to Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas). She and other former Democratic congressional aides posted a blueprint to lobby lawmakers, calling it the Indivisible Guide . Hundreds of so-called Indivisible groups have sprung up nationwide, including in Lance's district and elsewhere in New Jersey. \n\"These are local moms and grandparents,\" Dohl said. \"They had never been involved in activism before.\" \nJust as the Tea Party was supported by Americans for Prosperity, which has ties to energy executives Charles and David Koch, and Freedomworks, progressive organizations such as Moveon.org and the Center for American Progress Action Fund have backed efforts to save the law. The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists. Sad! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2017 \nThat has led some Republicans to dismiss the protests, which they do at their peril, said Ross Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University. \n\"If they can convince themselves that the people showing up are just a bunch of outsiders, they can sort of blow it off,\" Baker said. \"But if these people are real locals and genuinely in an uproar, they have a lot to be concerned about.\" \nJonathan D.
