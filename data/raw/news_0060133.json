A 26-year-old Gujjar youth, who has been on fast unto death since February 16 in protest against the scrapping of special backward class (SBC) reservation, got married at the 'dharna' spot at Sikandara Chauhraha area in Dausa district on Thursday morning. Despite his fast, the wedding ceremony was held and the youth promised to continue the struggle for Gujjar reservation. Thousands of members of the Gujjar community saluted the youth and blessed the couple during the ceremony. Devraj Gujjar was selected as a lecturer following an exam conducted by the Rajasthan Public Services Commission (RPSC). However, after Rajasthan High Court scrapped SBC reservation, he was among others who didn't receive appointment. Since February 14, many such candidates have been protesting at Sikandara, with 10 people, including a woman, fasting unto death and another 10 youths on relay hunger strike. Since his marriage was fixed eight months ago, he didn't want to delay it and requested the father of the bride to arrange for the wedding at the 'dharna' spot itself. \"Job and marriage are important events in a person's life. I have married Mamta Gujjar, who has done her master's in political science. She too gave her nod to my protest. So, we got married. I will continue my fast unto death,\" said Devraj while speaking to TOI over phone from Dausa. On her wedding, Mamta said, \"I am proud of my husband. He is doing a good deed for his fellowmen. If our demands are not met, I will also join the protest.\" \"I can't betray my fellow Gujjars. If I am protesting for a cause, I have to be honest. Several Gujjars have sacrificed their lives for reservation and I can't ruin their movement,\" Devraj said. Thousands of Gujjars attended the marriage ceremony. Some Gujjar leaders also organised a marriage feast. After the marriage, the groom remained at the 'dharna' spot while the bride went to the home of in-laws for post-marriage rituals.
