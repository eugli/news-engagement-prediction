This means that the students who have BEST passes for travelling from their house to school, would not be charged for the extra distance till the examination centre.\nIn a letter issued on February 23, BEST declared that students appearing for HSC exam from February 28 till March 25 and those appearing for SSC from March 7 till April 1, can travel from their house to the examination centre for free. They only have to carry their hall ticket and bus pass.\nOver and above this, students will also be allowed to enter from the front door of the bus to grab their seats. BEST officials would also be deployed at all the bus stops to ensure that students donâ€™t face problems.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:29:41.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
