She really wanted this one to work. 'She paid for his hair extensions. He got the plugs put in. That's the ultimate sign of love and dedication and she's been rewarded like this.' Revealed: 'She paid for his hair extensions. He got the plugs put in,' family friend Peter Ford told Kyle and Jackie O on Sydney radio on Monday Any change? Kylie was said to be deeply smitten with her beau and paid the large sum in what Ford called: 'The ultimate sign of love and dedication' News of Minogue and Sasse's split came almost exactly one year after the pair had announced their engagement. The singer and former Neighbours star began dating the 29-year-old in November last year and was said to be deeply smitten with her beau. However Ford told Kyle and Jackie O their breakup was being 'celebrated' by Kylie's loved ones, who thought he was 'bad news' and a 'bulls**t artist'. 'They're celebrating! They're thrilled! He was bad news,' the veteran entertainment reporter said Wrong for her?

'She paid for his hair extensions. He got the plugs put in. That's the ultimate sign of love and dedication and she's been rewarded like this,' Peter said Too close? The engagement is said to have ended over rumours that Joshua had gotten close to actress Marta Milan 'I don't think so. That was part of her concerns, but it's been off for a while. It's been off since before Christmas. He's had to go home to live with mum and dad,' he said. Peter believes that Kylie's split was a small mercy as a divorce between the pair down the line would have been 'messy'. He told Kyle and Jackie, 'Thank god this didn't end up in a marriage.
