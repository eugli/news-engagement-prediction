The findings have been published in the latest issue of PeerJ , an open access journal. \nHydroelectric project \nWhile turning the spotlight on the amphibian diversity of the Western Ghats, the discovery also highlights the threat posed by human activities to the species. \nThe Athirappilly Night Frog was found close to the Athirappilly waterfalls, the proposed site of a hydroelectric project, while the Sabarimala Night Frog was discovered near the hill shrine which receives lakhs of pilgrims every year. The Radcliffe’s Night frog and the Kadalar Night Frog were reported from plantation areas. \n“Over 32% of the frog species in the Western Ghats are already threatened with extinction. Out of the seven new species, five face considerable anthropogenic threats and require immediate conservation,” says Prof. S.D Biju, who led the study and has formally described over 80 new species of amphibians from India. \nRestricted range \n“Because several of the new species have been identified as being range-restricted and impacted by threats, it is important to assess their extinction risks and tailor conservation strategies for both species and habitats,” said Ariadne Angulo, co-Chair, Amphibian Specialist Group, IUCN, in an emailed response. \nThe discovery has taken the total number of known Nyctibatrachus species to 35, of which 20% are diminutive in size (less than 18 mm). \nAs many as 103 new amphibian species have been described from biodiversity- rich Western Ghats region between 2006 and 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:53:44.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
