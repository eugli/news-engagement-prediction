We think we have a potential to do better,” he said. \nJaitley lauded Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, his ministers and civil servants for working with a positive frame of mind for implementation of GST by the middle of this year, which, he said, would bring a transformational change. \nHe said once the GST regime is implemented, the whole country will become one big market with easy flow of goods and services, with the help of good taxation system and one assessment system, instead of multiple ones. \n“So on the one hand, you have a system where evasion becomes difficult and on the other, generation of shadow economy through taxation system becomes more difficult,” he added. \nJaitley said government has taken a series of steps to integrate the informal economy with the formal one, which could increase revenue for states as well as the Centre. \nThe government has chosen to invest in agriculture, infrastructure and social sectors, he said. \n“We have chosen to invest in agriculture where a larger purchasing power is in existence,” he said. \nJaitley said it is only when Karnataka achieves 2% to 3% higher than the national growth rate that its ability to lead India economically would become a reality. \n“You are one of the most innovative states. You have a very progressive population, a progressive set of policies.” \nThe conference was organised by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Karnataka government and Confederation of Indian Industry. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:34.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
