JUST WATCHED Who is National Security pick McMaster? 01:35 Story highlights Gayle Lemmon: McMaster assumes his new national security adviser role in America that is at war but does not act like it For the most part, its citizens are insulated from the fights waged in their name, she says Gayle Tzemach Lemmon is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of the New York Times best-seller, \"Ashley's War: The Untold Story of a Team of Women Soldiers on the Special Ops Battlefield.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN) For days after the dramatic resignation of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn -- followed by Ret. Vice Adm. Bob Harward's rejection of President Donald Trump's offer of the job -- America remained without a permanent national security adviser. Now, Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster has stepped up for the job. Gayle Tzemach Lemmon McMaster's arrival amid the headline-grabbing upheaval in America's national security infrastructure comes at the same time America pursues plans for expanding its wars abroad. What we are witnessing is a profound mismatch between America's desire to project stability around the world and its inability to establish stability at home. America is a nation at war that does not act like it. For the most part, its citizens are insulated from the fights waged in their name. The result? Americans don't demand and prize stability in their national security infrastructure in part because the consequences are so hidden from their sight. But there is a danger in that distancing.

Meanwhile, an anesthetized America remains safely removed from the relentless demands of constant deployments. This gap leaves America viewing its internal political chaos as a purely domestic matter, rather than a critical piece of the way the world sees American power, weighs it and judges it on battlefields across the world by people deciding whether to back -- or back away from -- US forces. In other words. America's internal discord quickly leaps beyond America's borders to touch and even shape America's wars, even if American citizens are too distant from those battles to realize it or too ill-informed about them to know they should care. We are at a critical moment. Right now, the Pentagon is drawing up new and dusting off old recommendations for Syria at the President's behest, recommendations that may include deploying conventional ground troops inside the country to join special operations forces already there.
