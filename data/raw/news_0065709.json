Just ask Abrahiem Sarwar. \nEarlier this week, the the full-time student from San Antonio, Texas watched as a before-and-after photo got more than 300K likes on the popular Instagram account WorldstarHipHop. \nIt didn’t hurt that there’s a great story behind the 21-year-old’s weight loss transformation: Part of the reason his girlfriend left him two years ago was because of his weight. \nAt his heaviest, Sarwar was 380 pounds. Today, he’s 205 pounds. Photo courtesy of Abrahiem Sarwar Sarwar two years ago and today. \n“I got heavier throughout the four-and-a-half-year relationship,” he told The Huffington Post. “I just got comfortable with her and myself when we were together and really didn’t notice myself getting bigger.” \nWhen his then-girlfriend made a remark about his weight ― and none of the clothes he tried on at the mall fit anymore ― Sarwar decided it was time to get back in shape. \n“I knew I had to get myself together, not for her but for myself,” he said. “It was really depressing to me where I was in my life.” Photo courtesy of Abrahiem Sarwar Sarwar in November 2014. \"I always had to buy clothes online since nothing I'd find at the mall fit.\" \nSarwar admits that heading to the gym regularly was rough going at first. \n“I would go to the gym here and there throughout high school but just stopped going altogether eventually,” he said. “I didn’t have any motivation for a while. Then I found my motivation in trying to prove to myself and everyone else that I could change my whole life around.” A post shared by 👻- ABRAHIEM (@abrahiem) on Feb 16, 2017 at 5:18pm PST \nYouTube fitness videos ― especially those posted by vlogger Christian Guzman ― helped Sarwar learn proper form and small hacks to maximize his gym visits. Cutting back on trips to fast food restaurants throughout the week made a huge difference, too. \n“I started to cook the recipes I saw bodybuilders eat on YouTube,” he said. “It was a lot better for me and way cheaper than what I was spending daily to eat out.” A post shared by 👻- ABRAHIEM (@abrahiem) on Feb 6, 2017 at 8:22pm PST \nToday, Sarwar aspires to be a fitness vlogger ― and he absolutely loves hearing how his two-year weight loss journey inspires others to prioritize their health. \n“I know how it feels to have no hope, to have no guidance, just being down all the time about yourself,” he said. “But only you can change that. You have to know that no one else can put in the hard work but you.” Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:08:59.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
