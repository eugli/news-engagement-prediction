His game has risen to a new level under the guidance of first-year Houston coach Mike D’Antoni. \nAs you might imagine, both players have sky-high usage rates. Westbrook’s 41.8 mark tops the NBA while Harden’s 34.3 mark ranks third. (DeMarcus Cousins ranks second in that regard) \nIn other words, both Westbrook and Harden are tasked with making their teams click on the offensive end and take on huge roles. \nAs you might imagine, high turnover rates are a result of the constant ball-handling, and Harden (5.9) and Westbrook (5.5) lead the NBA in turnovers per game. \nBut, to take that a step further, they have also both made history in that regard this season. \nWhen Westbrook recorded 11 turnovers against the Warriors on Saturday night, he accomplished something that hadn’t been done in 30 seasons. \nFive games of 10-plus turnovers is an historically-bad mark. Harden’s four such games are the second-worst mark in that span. \nWith just under half of the regular season left to go, it remains to be seen how many more of these high-turnover games will occur for either star, but at least a couple more of these performances should be expected. \nAs of now, the MVP race hasn’t been affected by the turnover history in the making, but down the stretch, it might become an issue for one or both of these star players.
