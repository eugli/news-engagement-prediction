Have sex. We'll pay. \nSweden is already celebrated for its generous welfare state where people get 480 days of paid parental leave and universal health care. \nBut according to the New York Times , a local official could add to that list if his novel proposal to improve work-life balance and lift the local birth rate gets the tick: give the municipality's 550 employees an hour long paid break each week to go home and have sex. \nPer-Erik Muskos, 42, is a councilman from the northern town of Overtornea. In introducing his proposal this week, he told the town council that it would give a nudge to the dwindling local population, add spice to aging marriages and improve employee morale. \nThe New York Times reported that his idea of giving employees the right to subsidised sex quickly got attention all over Sweden, where for at least some, it was a welcome distraction from President Trump's vague reference to problems the country was having with immigration, which were strongly denied by baffled Swedes. \nNoting that \"sex is also a great form of exercise and has documented positive effects on wellbeing,\" Muskos suggested that local municipal employees could use an hour of the work week already allotted for fitness activities to go home to have sex with their spouses or partners instead. \n\"We should encourage procreation. I believe that sex is often in short supply. Everyday life is stressful and the children are at home,\" Muskos explained in his motion in Overtornea . \n\"This could be an opportunity for couples to have their own time, only for each other.\" \nThe motion, which is expected to be voted on in the spring, needs a simple majority to be passed by the 31-member council. As of now, opinion on the council is divided and his proposal has been meet with praise, ridicule and criticism. \nWhat happens if people choose to use their hour to go for a walk or while away their working hours on Tinder, looking for someone to help fill-in next week's hour? Ad Feedback \nSweden has among the highest fertility rates in the European Union, according to Eurostat , the bloc's statistic agency, in part because of the country's generous parental leave systems and immigration. But the fertility rate has nevertheless been decreasing recently. \nMalin Hansson, 41, a sexologist and specialist in reproductive health in Gothenburg, applauded the initiative, arguing that sex reduced stress, improved sleep and strengthened immunity, while enriching intimacy between couples. \"If it was up to me, I would introduce this across the country,\" she said, adding: \"In Sweden, sex is considered just another activity.\" \nLotta Dellve, a professor in the sociology department at the University of Gothenburg , said that her research showed that short bursts of physical activity during office hours had many benefits, including productivity. \"This activity could include sex, why not?\" she asked. \nBut Professor Dellve, who is married and has two daughters in their 20s, said it would be ridiculous for employers to mandate when employees should become intimate. \"It is wonderful to see your spouse during the workday, but you don't necessarily want to have sex,\" she said. \nTomas Vedestig, 42, a left-leaning municipal councilman in Overtornea, said that when Mr. Muskos made his pitch, his colleagues were so taken aback that they thought they had misheard him. \n\"I don't think it's the employer's business to say, 'Go home for an hour and make babies,'\" he said. \nAnd some proponents worried the proposal was too stingy: \"I spoke to a couple of older gentlemen who said, 'One hour? That is not enough time.'\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:08:58.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
