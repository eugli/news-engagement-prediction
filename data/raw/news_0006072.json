(Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Morgan Greene Chicago Tribune \nPorchlight Music Theatre will perform its 2017-18 season at the Ruth Page Center for the Arts, the Equity musical theater company announced Wednesday. \nPorchlight, which has previously been a resident company at Stage 773 in the Belmont corridor, will become one of the Ruth Page Center's artists in residence. \n\"Over the last few years, Porchlight has experienced an increase in subscribers and single ticket buyers that has accompanied an increase in the volume and scope of Porchlight Music Theatre programming,\" said executive director Jeannie Lukow in a statement. \"These factors pointed to the need for a larger capacity venue that would still retain the intimate approach for our musical productions, as we work to expand our audience and supporter base for future seasons.\" \nThe Ruth Page (1016 N. Dearborn St.) offers the company 215 seats, an increase from Stage 773's 148 seats. \nThe new move will be celebrated with events coinciding with Porchlight's yet-to-be-announced 23rd season, beginning Sept. 2017. \nThe Ruth Page was previously the home of Chicago Children's Theatre, which will open the first production at its new West Loop home this week. \nRELATED STORIES: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:33:39.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
