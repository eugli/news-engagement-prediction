The result is some vintage political cowardice, where congresspeople have ducked out of meetings early or haven't bothered to show up at all. Below are some highlights from the week. Let's go to the videotape! Bill Cassidy Chants of \"yes or no\" following this question, guy walks out yelling \"2020, you're done\" at @BillCassidy townhall pic.twitter.com/oLKbGuNGZn \n— Caitlin Owens (@caitlinnowens) February 22, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Constituents of Louisiana's sixth district made their intentions pretty clear from the get-go. Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana's opening prayer was interrupted when one person yelled a quick \"Amen!\" and then someone else a less subtle \"Let's get on with it,\" according to The Times-Picayune . And with that, the 200 or so in the room (hundreds of others were outside) got right to the good stuff. In one exchange on healthcare, a constituent asked Cassidy, \"Will you repeal Obamacare with or without this magic you've concocted?\" Most Popular The Senator also faced questions on Betsy DeVos, but his attempts at explaining her family's donations to his campaign were met with a steady chorus of \"sell out\" chants from the crowd. Cassidy stayed calm during the meeting, but noted to the State Chaplain afterwards, \"Wow, they booed the name of Jesus.\" Tom Cotton After more than 1,000 people lined up outside his event, Arkansas' junior senator took questions from an admirably large and unrestrained audience Wednesday night. The result, early on, was what felt like a formative moment in this new movement: Ark. woman to Tom Cotton: \"First of all, I am Mary Story from Fayetteville and I am not a paid protester.\" pic.twitter.com/0ULnW6gWwI \n— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) February 23, 2017 There was an indignant triumph in her voice, and the cheer that greeted her wasn't at all surprising. The words of another attendee were less sunny, but no less galvanizing: Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Voter to @SenTomCotton : My husband is dying. We can't afford health insurance. What kind of insurance do you have? https://t.co/iYFiZtwJ1F Other times, things were simpler: Tom Cotton town hall simply chants, \"Tax returns.\" over and over. https://t.co/x1G2j8dvGm pic.twitter.com/Tqgs4fC82t \n— Bill Gray (@BGPublic) February 23, 2017 Mitch McConnell \n— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 21, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The Senate Majority Leader braved the treacherous terrain of his home state and was met by a constituent who knew her stuff. First, she nailed the fact that the coal industry is very unlikely to come back regardless of action the Trump White House and its allies in Congress take, largely due to larger economic factors (particularly the rise of natural gas). Second, she correctly pointed out that repealing Obamacare will strip coal miners , many of whom are McConnell's constituents in Kentucky, of their black lung medical benefits. Third, she referenced McConnell's showdown with Senator Elizabeth Warren on the Senate floor earlier this month. Most Popular Also, the look on McConnell's face as he realized what was about to happen is something approaching priceless. Tom McClintock The representative for California's fourth district played host to around 400 constituents, among whom was a woman who said Obamacare dropped her monthly healthcare premiums from $400 to $1. She asked McClintock what exactly he would do to keep her care affordable: His answer was less than specific. Then, on the topic of climate change, he said it wasn't worth changing our economy over because the Earth has been warming \"on and off since the Ice Age.\" This also did not go down well. Dave Brat The Virginia Congressman, who in 2014 made his name trouncing the sitting Majority Leader of his party in a primary, didn't seem like such an outsider maverick type this week—except geographically. He held his town hall at the very edge of his district, around 60 miles from where most of his constituents live. But he still couldn't beat the heat : Here's a transcript of the amazing town hall exchange where Virginia Rep. Dave Brat said economic growth is how to protect the environment: pic.twitter.com/ggQjohNRpR \n— Daniel Dale (@ddale8) February 22, 2017 Brat: \"I don't think I said anything very controversial.\" Person in crowd: \"Yeah you did! And stupid!\" Dave Brat workshopped some new material at his town hall (4 times!) https://t.co/gxYOkhMjlP pic.twitter.com/w4zG4pCy7L \n— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 22, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:41:25.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
