Newham Council has launched a probe into food hygiene at the Secret Cinema event \nIt is the latest immersive screening by the company, the brainchild of entrepreneur Fabien Riggall, which has also put on sell-out performances of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, Back to the Future and Terry Gilliam’s Brazil in recent years. \nAs part of the latest experience visitors can eat at an Oyster bar – Marsea - with six oysters served for £10. Kat Swayer, right, and friend Claire Dewar who both fell ill after the Secret Cinema event \nSome of those who have complained online about food poisoning say they ate there on Friday or Saturday night. \nAhead of the next show tonight the production company are carrying out a probe into all the eateries in the food hall about what could be the cause of the alleged food poisoning. Exclusive first look at Secret Cinema's immersive Moulin Rouge \nActress Kate Sawyer, 36, from Camberwell in south London, one of the people to complain, said she was “violently ill” less than 24 hours after eating the oysters. \nShe was also one of several people to criticised Secret Cinema for slowness in responding to their complaints. \n“I woke up the next morning and I was already feeling unwell and later I was violently sick. An evening vomiting is pretty unpleasant. It was such a shame because the night was an incredible experience,” she said. \n“But I felt I had to warn this could be happening and ask for Secret Cinema to act because there is a obviously a food safety issue here for so many people to become ill.” Secret Cinema are investigating 12 complaints linked to food poisoning from oysters (Shutterstock ) \nHer friend Claire Dewar, 35, who runs a communication and events agency, and had travelled 75 miles from her home in Bury St-Edmunds in Suffolk to see the production, was also ill and had to take time off work. \nShe was sick around 28 hours after eating the oysters. She said: “There didn’t look to be anything wrong with the oyster bar but then we all fell ill and we knew what it was. \n“We just wanted to stop other people being ill by complaining,” \nShe said Secret cinema had been slow to respond to her compliant but was pleased it was now being taken seriously with a full investigation. She has been offered a full refund and tickets to another screening. \nOver a dozen people have also complained on social media. Nicole Kidman in the 2001 film Moulin Rouge \nOne attendee wrote on Facebook: “We attended on Sat night. Three of us had the oysters and are very ill. No official word from Secret Cinema.” \nIt is not the first time the cinema experience has been embroiled in difficulties since its launch in 2007. \nIn July 2014, thousands were left disappointed by short-notice cancellations of Back to the Future amid allegations the set was not ready. The opening dates of the 2013 production of Brazil were also cancelled at short notice. \nThe Moulin Rouge! Experience has been celebrated as the “best Secret Cinema performance so far” with some 80,000 people expected to attend in its run to the end of April. \nA Secret Cinema spokesman said: “We can confirm that we have had 12 complaints of food poisoning from audience members who attended over the weekend. We are taking these complaints very seriously and are conducting a full investigation. \n“Since the weekend our own independent food hygiene experts have completed an extensive and thorough investigation of the situation and are entirely satisfied that the matter is resolved and the sale of oysters has been suspended. \n\"We continue to ensure that our food safety and hygiene is of the highest standard. \n“We have had no further customer complaints since those attending on Saturday night. While this is an isolated incident, we do not underestimate the discomfort of this for our customers. We have personally followed up the small number of complaints we received.” \nA Newham Council spokesman said: “We have had a small number of suspected food poisoning cases reported to us which our food hygiene team is working with the event organisers to investigate.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:14:32.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
