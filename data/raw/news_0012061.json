Kirsten Farage leaves the family home at Downe, Kent, after reports that her husband is sharing his London house with a French woman politician (PA) \nSpeaking on his LBC Radio show, Mr Farage said he had been aware of recent press coverage about \"a few personal difficulties that I've had with my marriage and my family and my relationships\". \nHe said: \"All of us in our lives go through ups and downs and I regret the down that I am in at the moment. \n\"But I make this plea, particularly to the media - please leave my wife and children alone. Don't hassle them, don't intimidate them. They don't deserve it and it's simply not fair.\" \nThe couple married in 1999 after Mr Farage's divorce from his first wife, and have two children. \nIn a statement, Mrs Farage said: \"My husband and I have lived separate lives for some years and he moved out of the family home a while ago. Nigel Farage holds up a banner during a Ukip public meeting at Victoria Hall in Stoke (PA) \n\"This is a situation that suits everyone and is not news to any of the people involved.\" \nShe urged reporters not to \"doorstep\" her family home, saying: \"Having press camped out in front of my house is extremely distressing, especially for my children. Please let us get on with our lives.\" Nigel Farage and Paul Nuttall pelted with eggs in Stoke-on-Trent \nEarlier on Monday, Mr Farage was showered with eggs as he greeted Ukip leader Paul Nuttall near his campaign office in Stoke-on-Trent, where he is standing in the by-election this month. \nHe later appeared at a campaign event with Mr Nuttall where he held up a sign which read: \"He's not lying to you.\" Last week, London MEP Seb Dance made headlines when he held a similar sign aloft in the European Parliament behind Mr Farage's back. \nThe Mail on Sunday reported at the weekend that Laure Ferrari - who runs the Institute for Direct Democracy in Europe (IDDE) - has been living in the former Ukip leader's house in Chelsea for the past week. \nMr Farage told the newspaper he was helping her because she needed accommodation and had nowhere else to stay.
