Social About Jake Standup comedian, award winning cartoonist, eater of soft pretzels Jake was born in a small farming town in central CA and half grew up in Ventura. He then moved to Seattle just in time for grunge to hit and to get an unhealthy obsession with flannel. He started radio in Seattle in 1999 while at UW (probably the best college job of all time) and started doing standup in 2003. In 2006, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in comedy ...and then ended up working in a warehouse. Didn't really go as planned. Things rarely do. He now lives in Burbank and hikes the mountains there almost everyday. You can hear him Mon-Sat nights on ALT987 and can catch him telling jokes all around LA.
