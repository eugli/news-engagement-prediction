As of June, 300 more soldiers stationed in Kuwait will no longer be eligible.\nSoldiers say they feel betrayed. “This is an unsafe part of the world by any stretch of the imagination,” one told CTV News.\nA reminder of the danger came in 2015, when ISIS executed Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh after his plane crashed in Syria.\nDefence Minister Harjit Sajjan promised at a defence committee meeting on Dec. 1 to fix the situation, but so far nothing has changed.\nConservative MP James Bezan demanded in the House of Commons Wednesday that the government “do the right thing and restore full danger pay to these troops and their families.”\nBut Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would not commit to reversing the decision. “We're looking at a broad range of things in this budget,” Trudeau later responded. “We've committed to reducing taxes for the middle class, and that's what we're continuing to focus on,” he added.\nOne military mother has started a petition demanding the tax break be reinstated.\nWith a report from CTV’s Mercedes Stephenson \nRelated Stories Troops serving in Kuwait lose major tax exemption", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T06:01:24.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
