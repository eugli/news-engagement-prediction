(CBC)\nRight now, there are bottlenecks in the system, said Dornan.\n\"In fact, sometimes we have to cancel surgeries because we just don't have the ICU space.\"\nSimilarly, there is a \"tremendous need\" for cancer services, he said.\nThe cancer centre has the necessary oncologists, radiotherapists and physicists, \"but we just don't have the space to treat people timely.\"\nThe new larger space will nearly double the service and provide patients and their loved ones with more privacy, he said.\nAnd it will all happen with little disruption to patients because it's not just a renovation, it's an expansion, Dornan said.\nThe hospital will be increasing its footprint southward in the B tower, so while the construction is underway, patients will receive the same care they always have, and once it's complete, they will simply be relocated.\n\"So we don't expect to see much growing pains for patients.\"\nDornan said the planning and design work will take about a year. After that, construction will begin.\n\"It's very exciting,\" he said.\nThe provincial government has committed $90 million over five years to the project, which is expected to cost about $106 million.\nThe Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation will also contribute to the project.\nWith files from Information Morning Saint John", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:48:41.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
