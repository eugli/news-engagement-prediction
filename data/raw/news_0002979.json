He said he suspected it was a political ploy, and would be slow to form and begin hearing evidence. \nEarlier this week, the Liberal premier of Tasmania, Will Hodgman, said he had raised concerns about the debt recovery system with the federal government. \nHodgman said the situation “needs to be fixed”. \n“We’ve made that clear to the federal government, we don’t want to see Tasmanians disadvantaged, distressed in any way,” he said. \nLabor is expected to move to establish a Senate inquiry next week. It will likely not need Liberal votes, given the Greens, One Nation and Nick Xenophon’s bloc of senators have already voiced their support. \nLabor’s Linda Burney said Abetz’s comments stand in stark contrast to the government’s continued defence of the system. \n“Even Liberal senators know there is a problem with the robo-debt system, if the minister won’t own up and fix these issues then the parliament will hold him to account,” Burney said. \n“Alan Tudge is the minister overseeing Centrelink, if Centrelink is failing the Australian people then that responsibility lies at his feet.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:42:04.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
