Stock photo of a police bodycam Teachers are using police-style body cameras in the classroom to record unruly pupils. At least two English comprehensives have introduced the equipment with the consent of local education authorities. The cameras film all the time but only save encrypted footage when the record button is pressed. A teacher must give notice before shooting video, said Tom Ellis, a lecturer at Portsmouth University. And use of the devices must be 'proportionate and necessary' to comply with the data protection act, Mark Bridge reports in The Times . It is thought footage could be used to provide evidence for disciplinary action and be shared with parents of badly-behaved pupils. Body cameras have been handed out to thousands of British police officers in recent years. Last October it was announced that about 22,000 front-line policeman in the Metropolitan Police would be fitted with the devices.
