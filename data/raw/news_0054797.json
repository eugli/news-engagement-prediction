The cause of your weight gain is plain old gluttony, and you know it. It is very sad to see you blaming a physical condition (polycystic ovaries) for being a big fat pig rather than blaming it on your lack of self-control.\"\nIf you think he stopped there, you're sorely mistaken. \"There is nothing about your life that is 'Fabulous,'\" he continued in the letter. \"When you are a big fat sow as you are, it is a disgusting existence. You need to get out of denial and do something about your extreme obesity.\"\nSmartly, Whitney did do something about it — doctor's orders! She posted the letter on Facebook without disclosing the writer's identity. (At least someone has~*cLaSs*~!)\nIn her caption, Whitney opened up about her weight, or \"disgusting existence,\" as the doctor put it: At age 19, she abruptly gained 100 pounds in nine months. Thereafter, she lost 100 pounds in eight months, then gained it all back. She shares that she's struggled with bulimia and disordered eating on top of her PCOS, the hormonal imbalance that is in fact linked to weight gain and obesity, plus acne, facial hair growth, ovarian cysts, and infertility among other health issues.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below But her condition, Whitney says, is besides the point: \"Weight is a nuanced subject — it's not black and white, and I've never claimed that PCOS is the only factor or reason for my current weight, but to reduce it down to nothing silences the one in 10 women who deal with this syndrome every day and feel like they have no support,\" she wrote. \"It absolutely does not matter why someone is fat (or thin, or disabled, or anything else). All human beings deserve respect.\"\nYou don't need to be a doctor to agree with that.\nGet all the ~FiTsPiRaTiOn~ directly in your feed.
