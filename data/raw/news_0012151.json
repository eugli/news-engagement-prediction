(AAP) \nSydney can add a few more accolades to its record-riddled summer after another pair of stifling days and nights. \nThe city just endured its warmest pair of nights in 158 years of records. The minimum temperatures of 25.8 degrees on Sunday morning and 26.2 degree this morning ousted the record pair of 25.1 and 26.1 degrees from 2011, which also occurred in early February. \nDespite the weekend's heat, Sydney's record-matching tally of nine days over 35 degrees remains unchanged after the city topped out at 34.9 degrees on Sunday. \nRichmond extended its tally of days over 40 degrees this season to eight on Sunday, distancing this season from the previous record of six days from 2002/03. Richmond has more than 70 years of observational history. \nBankstown's 42.7 degrees was the highest temperature recorded in the Basin yesterday and the suburb's fifth day above 40 degrees this season. This summer now beats the 1979 record of four days. \nA cooler southerly change will bring relief across Sydney today and showers on Tuesday and Wednesday. While the respite and rain will be welcome, it will be short-lived. \nHotter weather will return to the Sydney Basin from Thursday and build towards what is shaping up to be another sweltering and potentially record-challenging weekend.
