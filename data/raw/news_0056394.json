The moment the man is restrained in his seat Facebook 4 Hero Chris Phillips said he simply did what he had to do \nThe terrifying ordeal came on the aptly registered Flight 007 to Heathrow with modest Chris branded “a real life James Bond”. \nThe 55-year-old ex Head of the National Counter Terrorism Security Office told The Sun: “I did what I had to do.” \nChris, who had been holidaying with his girlfriend in India, was fast asleep in the economy section of the Gulf Air service following a brief stop in Bahrain. \nHe was awoken by screams in the cabin and saw a full-scale brawl involving a passenger who had a member of the crew in a headlock. \nFour other flyers and two other stewards were embroiled in the melee. \nChris said: “It was chaos. The Muslim passenger was trying to walk to the First Class section of the plane. \n“He was shouting obscenities and it was a frightening scene. \n“He was fighting with a male member of cabin crew. They were rolling on the floor then slamming against the aircraft door. \n“It was terrifying to watch them roll into the aircraft exit at 30,000ft. Women and children were screaming. It was very upsetting.” \nQuick-thinking Chris stood back and began filming the scenes for evidential purposes after another passenger nearer the maniac got involved. \nThe ballsy passenger was a US soldier who sparked more vitriol from the flyer. \nTwo more stewards helped the American get the troublemaker into a seat. \nBut pandemonium broke out again when suddenly the passenger broke free and marched towards the front of the plane. \nAt this stage, with gasps and cries filling the cabin, Chris put his mobile phone down and jumped into action. \nUsing the police training he honed over a glittering career, he grabbed the Saudi Arabian-born passenger and secured him in an arm lock. \nWith desperate crew members looking on, Chris then put the passenger in handcuffs and forced him to take a seat.

He was bragging how the UK would be a Muslim country soon. \n“He said the British don’t breed enough. He boasted how Muslims have 15 children each. \n“It was a long six hours. I eventually got him calm and he nodded off. Then two hours in he was awake and ranting again. \n“Passengers nearby were terrified with good reason.” \nThe captain of the Gulf Air flight was going to divert the plane and return to Bahrain until Chris stepped in – saving the airline tens of thousands of pounds. \nThe cockpit crew radioed ahead to police at Heathrow and a team of armed officers stormed the plane on touchdown in the UK at 8am on Tuesday. \nThe 51-year-old passenger was arrested and taken away for questioning. \nChris, of South-West London and a former Inspector at Wimbledon Police Station for six years, was one of 15 passengers asked to give police statements in relation to the ordeal. \nThe hero told The Sun: “It was dramatic. I could hear the man on the floor shouting at the top of his voice. \n“I had to take him to the toilet twice. Eventually at Heathrow the police came on en-mass. \n“There were loads of kids on the plane. People were perturbed. There was a proper fight for 10 minutes at 30,000ft next to the aircraft door. About 30 passengers thanked me personally when we got off. \n“It was Flight GF 007, we were laughing about this.” SWNS:South West News Service ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:05:31.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
