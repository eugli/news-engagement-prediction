I'm still a virgin and he says he is one too. Since the past year, even before we were together, he asked me for sex almost daily but I refused. He says that on valentines day we must have sex or else he will break up with me. \nI don't want to do it because I'm scared and I want to wait for marriage. But he is a really caring, nice guy and is also well to do. He drives me around in his Porsche and lets me use the swimming pool in his bungalow. \nFor christmas he also treated me at a really expensive restaurant and spent like 200 dollars on a steak (OMG). I come from a middle class family and don't get to enjoy such a luxurious lifestyle. \nShould I just let him deflower me in exchange for living a high class life? Thanks for your advice and i hope my bf doesn't see this LOL  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:23:09.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
