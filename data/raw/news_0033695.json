Photo: Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images Kim Jong-nam, the older half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was killed in a Malaysian airport Monday after he was sprayed in the face with an unknown liquid, police said Tuesday . The attack was carried out by two women who escaped the Kuala Lumpur airport by taxi after the attack, according to TV Chosun, a South Korean news channel.\n“The deceased … felt like someone grabbed or held his face from behind,” a police official told Reuters . “He felt dizzy, so he asked for help.” Kim Jong-nam died in an ambulance on his way to a hospital.\nThe oldest son of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-nam was seen as the heir apparent in North Korea throughout the 1990s. But that reportedly changed after he was caught with a forged Dominican passport in 2001 as he was trying to sneak his way into Japan to attend Tokyo Disneyland. The subsequent fallout from that incident led to Kim Jong-un’s grooming to take over for the Dear Leader.\nKim Jong-nam, meanwhile, moved to Macau and regularly traveled to China and Singapore, earning a reputation as a playboy . He spoke occasionally about the goings-on in his home country, and it was rarely positive. In a 2012 book , an author Quote: d an email exchange with Kim Jong-nam in which he said that his younger half-brother’s “regime will not last long.”\n“Without reforms, North Korea will collapse, and when such changes take place, the regime will collapse,” he wrote, according to Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi. “I think we will see valuable time lost as the regime sits idle fretting over whether it should pursue reforms or stick to the present political structure.”\nOn Tuesday, Kim Jong-un was already being blamed for his brother’s death, with one South Korean politician saying the killing was a “naked example of Kim Jong-un’s reign of terror.” If the North Korean dictator did indeed order Kim Jong-nam’s killing, it wouldn’t be the first time he signed the death warrant for a family member. In 2013, his uncle and North Korea’s second-in-command was convicted of treason and sent to a gun range where his body was turned to pulp by anti-aircraft machine guns.\nTags: kim jong-un kim jong-nam north korea Kim Jong-un’s Brother Assassinated with Poison Spray Richard Branson Helps Obama Cram 8 Years of Relaxation Into One Vacation NYC’s Bodega Rally Was a Testament to Solidarity and Patriotism 24 Hours at JFK: The Hour-by-Hour Account of Two Iraqis’ Detainment and Release Most Viewed Stories Canadian PM Justin Trudeau Visits the White House, One-ups Trump at the Handshake Game Oklahoma Former Obama White House Photographer’s Instagram Is a Master Class in Shade The Madness of King Donald The The Bachelor Recap: The L-Word Moby, Yes Moby, Claims to Have Secret Intelligence Info on Trump Journalist Claims Omarosa Manigault Threatened Her, Said White House Has ‘Dossier’ on Her ABC Casts Its First Black Bachelorette , Spoils The Bachelor in the Process Psychologists Explain Why Ikea Is a Relationship Death-Trap Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer Guns & Empathy: A Documentary Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 4 mins ago 4 Days Later, Knicks Lift Charles Oakley’s Lifetime Ban NBA commissioner Adam Silver and Michael Jordan brokered a peace deal, but Oakley still wants a public apology.\n4:06 p.m. Kellyanne Conway Quote: -Tweets White Nationalist: ‘Love You Back’ The tweet has since been deleted, and Conway says she doesn’t know who has access to her account.\n3:52 p.m. U.S. Hits Venezuela’s VP With Sanctions for Drug Trafficking Tareck El Aissami has called the act a “vile aggression.”\n3:06 p.m. Russia Deploys Cruise Missile, Violating Arms-Control Treaty Not a great time to be without a national security adviser.\n1:42 p.m. Jury Convicts Man in Nearly 40-Year-Old Etan Patz Murder Case Pedro Hernandez, who confessed to killing the 6-year-old boy in 2012, has been found guilty.\n12:45 p.m. Workers Are Rushing to Fix the Oroville Dam Spillway With More Rain on the Way The crisis has been averted, for now, but crews are rushing to fix an emergency spillway that forced the evacuation of nearly 200,000.\n12:45 p.m. Kim Jong-un’s Brother Killed with Poison Spray at Airport The North Korean leader is accused of ordering the hit.\n12:34 p.m. Michael Flynn’s Resignation Is the Best News of the Trump Presidency So Far The Trump administration just lost its most dangerous Islamophobic conspiracy theorist.\n11:46 a.m. 3 Ways Republicans Are Dodging the Flynn Scandal Does anybody really want to investigate a tedious story about deceit, blackmail, and Russian intrigue?
