The bird didn't release its claws until whacked with a shovel by her husband, she said.\n\"My husband was hitting to kill,\" she said in a previous interview with CBC. \"It took a lot.\"\nThe small dog suffered seven puncture wounds and a bloody eye and ear, and lost several teeth and some skin from the top of his head.\nDominic Cormier, a wildlife biologist, says it was likely a great horned owl that attacked a 6Â½-pound dog in Beresford one night last week. (Jason Corbett)\nCormier suggested the trauma of the attack might explain Doucet-Daigle's confusion.\n\"At that moment she's not saying, 'Oh, I wonder what species is attacking my dog,\" he said. \"She's in shock.\"\nBut eagles are daytime predators, he said. Their eyes are made to hunt in the day, and they have terrible eyesight at night.\nEagle vs. owl \"It may be possible at some point in life, an eagle has hunted at night,\" Cormier said. \"It's so rare you would be hard-pressed to find an example.\"\nGreat horned owls are smaller than bald eagles, but not by much.  \nCormier said a great horned owl is a half-metre in length, with a wingspan of 1.1 metres. A bald eagle, the most common eagle in New Brunswick, is .7 metres long, with wingspan of about two metres.\n\"Things always look bigger at night,\" Cormier said.\n'Great horned owls have a much deadlier strike with their claws.' - Dominic Cormier Cormier said great horned owls are a widespread predator in New Brunswick that feed primarily on rodents, particularly rabbits. But they can attack cats and small dogs.\nGreat horned owls also have more force than an eagles, but eagles can pick up bigger prey.\n\"Great horned owls have a much deadlier strike with their claws,\" he said.\n\"If you got punctured by a great horned owl, the only way you're getting your arm back is if it lets go. That was the case with the dog. too. The bird finally let go.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:13:31.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
