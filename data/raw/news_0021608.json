Remini opened up about John Travolta’s status within the church, revealing the position she said he’s been given: “John was given a designation called Khakhan. … There’s a policy that basically says you can kill another human being if you are Khakhan’d, if you’re going to look the other way.” Remini said the religion has what’s called “ethics protection,” and that since Travolta has ethics protection, other individuals would be required to clean up the body if he were to murder someone. She went on to say that all of this is to show complete loyalty to the church, no matter what potential crimes are committed. According to Remini, “What you gotta do to protect the leader, you gotta do it. If you see a body, then you clean it up, and the leader should never know.” The actress has been making it her mission to expose what she claims is really going on behind the scenes in the Church of Scientology, with her show, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.
