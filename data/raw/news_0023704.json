Adam Schiff , D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that if the allegations are proven, Flynn should step down. \n\"If the now-national security adviser was undermining U.S. national security interests, he's unfit to hold that office,\" Schiff said in an interview with The Washington Post. \"Compounding the issue is whether he then misled the country about the nature of his contacts.\" \nCurrent and former U.S. officials said that in his conversation with Kislyak in late December, Flynn urged Moscow to show restraint in its response to punitive sanctions being imposed on Russia by former President Barack Obama's administration, signaling that the Trump administration would revisit the issue when it took office. \nThose contacts were seen by some U.S. officials as potentially illegal interference in the U.S. relationship with Moscow at a time when U.S. intelligence agencies were concluding that Russia had waged extensive cyber and influence campaigns to upend the 2016 presidential race and help to elect Trump. \nPresident Trump claimed to be unaware of the Flynn controversy as he traveled to Florida on Friday afternoon as part of a weekend trip with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In a brief exchange with reporters during the flight south, Trump was asked about the report in The Post that Flynn had discussed sanctions against Russia despite repeated denials. \n\"I don't know about that, I haven't seen it,\" Trump said, according to a transcript of the conversation. \"What report is that? I haven't seen that. I'll look into that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:19:44.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
