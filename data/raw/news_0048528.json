He said he’s been watching. He said keep killing (but) take the night off when you play us, but keep doing your thing. That’s crazy. I couldn't sleep (Friday) night when he said that. \n“For him to say he’s taking notice in what I’m doing first off lets me know I’m doing something somewhat right and second of all for him to say ‘keep going,’ that’s what I am going to keep doing.” \nEncouragement like that from an idol would be enough to keep just about anyone from drifting off to sleep, even a two time All-Star in the middle of a career year. \nWith Jordan’s words in tow, the five-foot-nine guard might even be able to take his game to new heights in the second half of this season.
