That's down slightly from last year, which saw a 49.0 overnight rating, and the year before, which had a 49.7. \nStill, it is Fox's best metered market rating ever, according to the network. \nTo come up with overnight ratings, Nielsen takes the percentage of households watching in 56 US markets and comes up with an average. A 48.8 means 48.8% of households in those 56 markets tuned into the game Sunday night. \nIt had appeared for most of the game as if ratings could take a hit due to a less-than-exciting contest, as the Atlanta Falcons dominated the Patriots for the first three quarters. \nBut then quarterback Tom Brady led the Patriots to a shocking comeback, forcing the game into overtime -- a Super Bowl first -- and likely keeping many viewers glued to their televisions in the process. \nThe numbers are subject to change as the day goes on and final viewership numbers are produced.
