He now started chasing me with a cutlass. I ran inside my house, took a gun and shot him. It is the work of the devil. \n“The government should have mercy on me by not sentencing me to death, but send me to jail.” \nOther suspects \nDuring the parade of no fewer than 43 suspected kidnappers, murderers and robbers arrested between January and February, the command disclosed that it recovered 25 arms and 32 ammunition in two months, adding that 19 kidnappers, 24 suspected murderers and impersonators were also arrested in the same period. \nThe state Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Iliyasu, while parading the suspects at the Police Command’s headquarters, Eleweran-Abeokuta, said the command employed proactive measures to curb the menace of cultism, kidnapping, robbery and other criminal activities. \nAmong those paraded was a five-member robbery gang from Chad and Niger republics, who the Commissioner said confessed to have robbed a Chief Magistrate, Mrs Sofowora Oriyomi, in Abeokuta and one Pastor Abatan of the Redeemed Christian Church of God at Idi-Aba area of Abeokuta. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:21:43.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
