Cars lose a lot of their resale value when an automaker announces they’re going out of production. \nBut don’t hesitate. For once, the huckster’s cry — “Supplies are limited!” — is true. Fiat Chrysler stopped building the 200 and Dart late last year. Whatever’s left on dealers’ lots is all there is. It’s the ultimate factory closeout because the factories that built them are closed for retooling to sell other — Chrysler hopes, more popular and profitable — vehicles. \nFiat Chrysler is offering 0% financing for 84 months — that’s right, seven years — on the cars, according to AIS Rebates, which tracks auto incentives. If you prefer cash rebates, the offers start at $3,500 to buy or lease a Dart. Shoppers considering a 200 can get 15% off the advertised employee price. \nOther incentives — for retirees, the military, people trading in a competitive vehicle, etc. — can save you more. The savings can add up to $4,000 or more on a 200, according to AIS Rebates. \n2016 Dodge Dart Limited (Photo: FCA US) \nThe Dart and 200 were commercial failures, but that does not make them bad cars. They’re relatively new, offer goodies like optional all-wheel drive, excellent voice recognition, navigation systems, Bluetooth compatibility, new-car warranties, LED lights and more. They’re comfortable and have been reasonably reliable, despite Fiat Chrysler’s poor quality ratings. \nI’ve driven both on long road trips and been perfectly happy behind the wheel for days. \n“The 200 and Dart have been great for us, and the incentives are aggressive,” said Wes Lutz, dealer principal of Extreme Dodge in Jackson and vice chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association. \nLutz only has a half dozen left on the new-car lot, but he’s snapping up every low-mileage used 200 and Dart he can get his hands on. \n“Some of the used cars are selling for half the price of a new one,” Lutz said. He prowls auctions that Fiat Chrysler holds for its dealers looking for cars coming off leases, FCA corporate vehicles and rental cars. \n“Most of them still have some of their new-car warranty left,” he said. “The cars are out of production, but people know Chrysler and Dodge dealers will still be there to service them. \n“I’ve got rows of pre-owned 200s and Darts, and I’m gonna have more. I’d like to have a hundred of them.” \nContact Mark Phelan: mmphelan@freepress.com or 313-222-6731. Follow him on Twitter @mark_phelan.
