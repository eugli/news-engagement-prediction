Cameron Burnell/Fairfax NZ \nCoastella organisers Gerry Paul and Paul Brown will debut their Tiny Town theater at the 2017 music festival. \nIrish musician Mundy performs his hit July inside Tiny Town. Filmed here on a 360-degree camera, click and drag on the video to adjust your view. \nThe inspiration came from when Paul and Brown were in a band touring the world, where some of the highlights included playing to small audiences. CAMERON BURNELL/FAIRFAX NZ. \nTiny Town - The World's Smallest Theatre \nREAD MORE: * Homegrown tipped to sell-out \n\"Often it was gigs that only four or five people were at that were the most memorable of the tour, and we'd go away thinking God that was an awesome gig. There was a chance almost to really get to know the audience. \n\"The crowd's nearly on top of you on the stage and there's this kind of real intimacy and this connection that happens. \n\"So we said why don't we try and build a tiny music venue so people can experience that.\" \nThere was nowhere for performers to hide on a stage measuring just 80 centimetres deep by two metres wide in front of an audience area spanning all of four square metres. \nThe setup comes complete with red velvet curtains, sound system, and a bouncer. \nThe outside was painted by Wellington Street Artist Sean Duffell. \nTiny Town, likely to be accompanied by a queue, will be one of five stages featuring at the festival. \nIt will be just one of the many surreal experiences Mundy's had in his 20-year music career, which included touring with the likes of Neil Young and Alanis Morissette. \nFresh from creating his self-titled, sixth studio album, Mundy, real name Edmond Enright, is taking his folk-rock tunes to nine centres on a national tour of New Zealand this month. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:27:47.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
