But when the co-host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe appeared on The Late Show Tuesday night to sing a tune with Stephen Colbert’s band, he was more critical and agreed the president’s actions are “not sustainable” over the next four years. \n“It just can’t,” he told Colbert, “and I’ll tell you, there are so many people — Republicans and Democrats alike, people that have voted for him, people who didn’t vote for him — that all agree this pace just can’t be sustained.” When asked if he thought Trump would be impeached before the end of his four-year term, Scarborough said, “That’s up to Donald Trump.” \nWhen asked if he thought Trump would be impeached before the end of his four-year term, Scarborough said, “That’s up to Donald Trump.” \nScarborough, describing the feeling of Trump’s first month in office as dying “a million deaths,” added, “I think if he continues the way he continued his first month, I just don’t think it’s sustainable, and I don’t think it’ll last four years.” \nEarlier, Scarborough said it’s “even harder to call [Trump] Mr. President” after watching “the way he’s acted over the past month.” \nRELATED: Hear more of the latest TV news from this week \n“I think we as Americans should not cheer against our president, like Rush Limbaugh said he was doing with Barack Obama. I actually think we should pray for our president, but that requires all of us as Americans to do what we can when a president is not doing what he needs to be doing, to stand up and do our part, too,” he said. “And right now, I think it’s the responsibility of all Americans, especially Republicans — and let me say this — especially Republicans in the Senate.” \nHe added, “When you have a president that actually questions free speech, the First Amendment, and news organizations that are doing their job, I think it’s incumbent upon my party, especially, to stand up right now and speak out.” \nAfter the heavy discussion on the state of America and democracy, Scarborough, who plays in a band called Morning Joe Music, joined the Late Show musicians in a rendition of Elvis Costello ‘s “(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding.” \nTouching on the song title and lyrics, Scarborough said it’s “so appropriate right now.” \nWatch Scarborough’s visit in the videos above.
