By Sara Clarke | Assistant Managing Editor Jan. 31, 2017, at 8:18 p.m. Cancel Denver-based judge Neil Gorsuch is President Donald Trump's pick to fill the open Supreme Court seat. David Zalubowski/AP \n1. Neil McGill Gorsuch was born on Aug. 29, 1967, in Denver to David Ronald Gorsuch and Anne Gorsuch Burford. \n2. President Ronald Reagan chose Gorsuch’s mother as the first woman to head the Environmental Protection Agency. \n2. Gorsuch and his wife Marie have two daughters. \n3. Gorsuch graduated with honors (and was elected into Phi Beta Kappa) from Columbia University in 1988. He received a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1991 (where he attended as a Harry Truman Scholar and graduated with honors) and a Ph.D. in philosophy from England’s Oxford University, where he attended as a Marshall Scholar. \n4. At Columbia, Gorsuch co-founded the Federalist Paper, a student newspaper that claimed to be “classically liberal” but featured conservative viewpoints. \n5. While at Harvard, Gorsuch participated in the Harvard Prison Legal Assistance Project and the Harvard Defenders program. \n6. Gorsuch served as a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Byron White and he assisted Justice Anthony Kennedy. \n7. “When Neil came to our firm in 1995, he had gray hair,” said Mark Hansen, Gorsuch’s former law partner at the D.C. law firm Kellogg Huber Hansen Todd Evans & Figel. “In fact, he was born with silver hair, as well as an inexhaustible store of Winston Churchill quotes.” \n8. Former President George W. Bush nominated Gorsuch to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in May 2006. Based in Denver, the 10th Circuit has territorial jurisdiction over areas in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Wyoming and Utah, and the portions of Yellowstone National Park in Idaho and Montana. \n9. In his book “The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,” Gorsuch writes that “all human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong.” \n10. Gorsuch is a fan of outdoor sports such as fly-fishing, rowing and skiing.
