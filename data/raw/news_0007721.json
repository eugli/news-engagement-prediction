York freshman Megan Cronin competes in the floor exercise at the West Suburban Silver girls gymnastics meet at Glenbard West on Saturday. (Jon Langham / Pioneer Press) Gregg Voss Pioneer Press \nAfter her floor exercise at the West Suburban Silver meet Saturday, York freshman gymnast Megan Cronin did a high-step leap off the mat, much to the delight of the crowd. That typifies her attitude toward the sport. \n\"I was happy that I did a good routine and because I just think gymnastics is fun,\" said Cronin, who lives in Elmhurst. \"I just get happy after I do it.\" \nCronin is part of a young core of gymnasts who are building the foundation for the York program under first-year coach Anthony Colant. Cronin turned in one of the Dukes' top performances Saturday, placing eighth in the uneven bars with a score of 8.325, and 10th in the vault at 8.7. \nHer floor exercise earned her a score of 7.975, which tied her for 23rd in that event but did not temper her enthusiasm. \n\"Today I was happy about my performance on vault and bars,\" Cronin said. \"Those are probably my two favorites. My floor exercise was lower than it usually is. I usually get in the mid-8s.\" \nIt's been a unusual season for Cronin, Colant and the rest of the York squad, which took sixth at the conference meet, won by host Glenbard West (142.550), with a score of 128.725. Colant, who was hired two weeks before the season started, said he hadn't been cleared to host an open gym until two days before his first practice because his background check hadn't been completed. \nWhen the season began, because he wasn't familiar with his new athletes, Colant clustered the freshmen together on the junior varsity team, including Cronin. But it didn't take her long to convince Colant that she belonged on varsity, and she has made the most of the opportunity. \nCronin led the Dukes to a third-place finish at the Palatine Invitational on Dec. 17, scoring 8.15 on the uneven bars and 8.45 on the floor exercise. At York's invitational on Jan. 21, Cronin led the Dukes to a fifth-place finish, thanks in part to a score of 9.1 on the vault, tied for ninth place. \n\"Her biggest contribution to this team is her work ethic,\" Colant said. \"She's always working. If she's over at the floor and I'm on bars, she's always working on something. I can trust her to work on the assignments that she's supposed to be doing without getting distracted.\" \nCronin said she was \"stressed\" as York's season drew closer and a coach hadn't been named. Now as regional competition begins this week, Cronin credited Colant for building her skills and her confidence. \n\"With a new coach, I've gotten so many new skills, and I've kind of learned to push down my fear and go for things,\" Cronin said. \"Just getting new skills, like my double-back on bars and my pike tsuk on vault, I got those things just this season.\" \nBesides Cronin, York has another promising gymnast in sophomore Sydney Hill, who took fifth Saturday in the uneven bars with 8.875 points. \n\"We've made a lot of progress, and next year we're going to go further,\" Colant said. \"That was really the goal for this season, to build a foundation for a program that the girls can have fun in and achieve some things.\" \nGregg Voss is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press. \nTwitter @Pioneer_Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:33:56.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
