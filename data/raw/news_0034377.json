The offer was declined with thanks.” \nThankfully, police were able to convince the man to come back to safety, and he was ultimately escorted to hospital for treatment. \nDrake is in Europe for the Boy Meets World Tour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:46:05.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
