Maybe she was afraid seeing her mother in such a situation,\" Nurul recalled the \"funny\" birth experience. \nNurul said she began to feel contractions while at home and had alerted her husband to make a trip to the hospital. \nBut they had to make a stop at the office, which was five minutes away, as she had left her medical record book in her office desk. \nWhile her husband, Isnawi Samingan, 39, went to get the book, she went to relieve herself in the toilet and was shocked that the baby's head was already coming out. \n\"I dashed towards the lift, but the pain was getting intense. Worried that the baby might suffocate, I started to push,\" she said. \nIsnawi said the whole delivery process took less than 10 minutes and it was an unforgettable experience. \n> Body of crocodile attack victim found The body of Agnes Luang, 18, was found Wednesday after she went missing while bathing in a river in Marudi, Miri.

The 40-year-old artiste said she hoped her seven-month-old baby boys would get used to travelling to different countries. Lee said the jobs of her and her husband required them to travel so she hoped the babies could also follow them. Last year, Lee brought the children to Taiwan where she was one of the judges for Taiwanâ€™s Golden Horse Awards. <>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:30:32.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
