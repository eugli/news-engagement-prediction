The HGTV star sat down with Michael Strahan on Good Morning America on Feb. 21 and admitted that she's been coping well with her highly public divorce. \"Honestly, despite everything, I'm doing really, really, really good,\" she said in the interview. \nChristina explained how dealing with Tarek's cancer and her struggles with infertility prepared the former couple to manage their divorce. Through it all, their primary focus is their two children, Taylor and Brayden, who are dealing with the separation swimmingly. \"Our kids are transitioning well,\" she said. \"Tarek and I are friends and we have a lot of support from our family. The kids are doing great — really great.\" \nOf course, the renovation expert couldn't make it through the interview without addressing the one question that's been on the minds of Flip or Flop fans everywhere: what will happen to the show following the divorce? Currently, season six is on the air, and Christina revealed that she and Tarek are filming season seven now, shooting footage together three or four days a week. \"We have a great crew, we have fun on set, and we look forward to continuing the show,\" she said. ADVERTISEMENT \nOn whether it's strange to work with Tarek, the show host said it's been business as usual. \"Honestly, Tarek and I met at work, so we worked together before we ever started dating and it's our normal . . . We'll always be working together,\" she explained. \nChristina wrapped up the interview by sharing that she has a book in the works and she and Tarek still plan to give their Success Path seminars following the divorce. It looks like this isn't the last we'll be seeing of our favorite former couple.
