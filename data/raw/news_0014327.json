I had been in management before and thought it would be similar, and found out quite quickly that it's completely different. \n\"But I've loved the experience.\" \nIt was when renewing the lease on her Darwin bar and restaurant that Ms Staples looked back on what she had learned and decided to embrace another challenge. \n\"I suppose I'm looking for validation of five years on the job learning and to challenge myself and pick up some things I haven't learned along the way,\" she said. The chairs are pushed in, the smart board is clean and brand new graduate teacher Anita Camporeale can't stop smiling. \nStarting a Bachelor of Commerce this month, Ms Staples is one of many mature age students this year embarking on an experience typically associated with high school graduates and people in their early 20s. \nYet Charles Darwin University student recruitment manager Marissa Briston said many of the students enrolling at the institution are in a similar position to Ms Staples. \nAlmost three-quarters of the university's students are mature age and can take up to a decade to complete a three-year course. \n\"Lots are returning to study or getting a second degree or postgraduate qualifications to enhance their skills,\" Ms Briston said. \n\"But we also find a lot of mature age students who are starting study for the very first time or they've been out in the workforce for a long time and want a career change.\" 'It's almost as good as a holiday' \nThis was the experience of Darwin plumber Luke Johns, who had worked as a plumber for 12 years. \n\"I had enough playing in the poo and decided a career change wasn't bad. I was over plumbing but still liked the building industry,\" he said. \nA chance placement saw him enrolled in a carpentry apprenticeship in 2016. \n\"It's almost as good as a holiday. It's a lot of fun,\" he said. \n\"I was becoming a stagnant, old grumpy man at 29 years old. This has given me a second lease in life.\" Photo: Luke Johns has finished 12 years as a plumber to study again as a carpenter. (Supplied: Luke Johns) \nYet Mr Johns said that while the \"stimulation had been worth the pay cut\", it was important for new mature age students to be realistic about the workload and change to their lifestyle. \n\"I've gone from being a foreman role, which was a bit stressful — now I'm at the bottom of the pile. I'm working a lot harder because I'm at the bottom of the pile but I'm really loving it,\" he said. \nOthers said there were unexpected hurdles — like dealing with teachers used to managing teenagers. \n\"I went back to university at 40 to do a Masters by research. I had a supervisor who kept talking to me like I was 17,\" one texter told ABC Radio Darwin . \n\"I kept reminding her that I found her a bit patronising, but she kept talking to me like that. In the end I changed my supervisor.\" Organisation is 'key thing' for mature age students \nMs Briston's advice for older people considering going back to school included doing research before enrolling, weighing up vocational or academic styles of higher education, and talking to a career coach. \n\"We say, certainly, you need to be organised. That's the key thing,\" she said. \n\"If you have work and family commitments, make sure you have a schedule to set aside a couple of hours a week for your studies. \n\"I think also a good tip is to have a good support system: family and friends when you need some hours to hit the books and concentrate on your studies.\" \nFor Ms Staples, going back to university for the second time will require balancing textbooks, essay writing and online lectures with continuing to run her hospitality business and raise two children. \nShe said she expected to spend up to 10 hours a week participating in tutorials and then an extra five to seven hours studying at home. \n\"But it might be a fantasy. It might be a hell of a lot more and no more Saturday nights on the town,\" she said. \n\"I'm pretty sure there'll be a few tears and tantrums along the way, but we'll get through it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T15:30:41.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
