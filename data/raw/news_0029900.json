Ponnaiyan. (Photo: DC) Chennai: In a big jolt to AIADMK general secretary V.K. Sasikala Natarajan, senior party leader C. Ponnaiyan on Saturday met interim Tamil Nadu O. Panneerselvam and extended his support to him.\nHours after she despatched a letter to Tamil Nadu Governor Ch. Vidyasagar Rao requesting him to immediately meet her, Sasikala drove in to a resort near Chennai to meet party lawmakers.\nRead: ‘Our patience has a limit’: Sasikala meets AIADMK MLAs to strategise\nAccording to reports, village residents have complained that their roads are being blocked and street-lights are switched off at night, all to ensure the MLAs can remain locked in.\nAIADMK Rajya Sabha MP V. Maitreyan earlier on Saturday urged President Pranab Mukherjee and the Central Government to take \"severe action\" against Sasikala, for her \"threatening\" statement against the state governor.\nEarlier in the day, in a letter to Tamil Nadu governor C. Vidyasagar Rao, Sasikala recalled that she had met him on February 9 along with her senior ministers, consequent to her seeking an appointment with him to hand over the letter of party MLAs electing her as their leader.\nSasikala said she was initially reluctant to take the responsibility of the Chief Minister as she was struck with grief following former Tamil Nadu chief minister J. Jayalalithaa's death.\nSasikala's comments came after Panneerselvam alleged that he was told to quit the Chief Minister's post to protect party's discipline and failure to follow would be a violation of party discipline.\nCalling Sasikala as the \"temporary general secretary\", Panneerselvam said, \"The Council can only appoint a temporary general secretary. Proper elections have to be held to elect a general secretary according to the party bye-laws. People are on my side.\"\nHe said he would also seek the support of Jayalalithaa's niece Deepa Jayakumar, saying \"I have always had respect for Amma's brother's children. I will give Deepa the respect she needs.\nThe acting Chief Minister also said he has the support of the AIADMK leaders and would prove his majority in the assembly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:06:45.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
