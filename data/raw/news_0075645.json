Kimmel brought the group to the front of the theater with Gary and his fiancee Vicky leading the pack. \n“I now pronounce you husband and wife,” Washington said as he was awkwardly sandwiched between the couple. “Kiss the bride,” Washington then said before handing his mic back to Kimmel with a ‘my work here is done’ look on his face. \nKimmel was quick to authenticate the wedding. “He’s Denzel, so it’s legal,” the host quipped.

It may not be the kind of ultra-high-definition camera that the cinematography nominees usually have at their disposal, but the footage will probably make for fantastic viewing back at Gary and Vicky’s household. \nGary also managed to grab a quick selfie with best supporting actor winner Mahershala Ali holding the Oscar statuette before leaving. \nGary, the lucky husband from Chicago, has quickly become a twitter sensation, with one commenter on twitter dubbing him the ‘Ken Bone of the Oscars.’ Gary is the Ken Bone we really deserved all along. #Oscars \n— Ben Boskovich (@benbosk) February 27, 2017 \n“Gary is the Ken Bone we really deserved all along,” tweeted Ben Boskovich.
