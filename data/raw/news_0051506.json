Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Some relationships just aren't meant to work out and, when the break-up comes, it can be hard for both parties.\nBut if whoever is in the wrong acknowledges this with an apology, it can help the healing process somewhat.\nOne man whose girlfriend broke up with him recently received a four-page, guilt-ridden letter from her asking for his forgiveness.\nInstead of tucking it away in a cupboard somewhere or ripping it to shreds and throwing it in the bin, Nick Lutz decided to mark it as if he were grading an essay.\nGraded apology letter (Photo: @NickLutz12/Twitter) He then posted photographs of the letter to Twitter - where it was retweeted more than 100,000 times - along with the caption: \"When your ex writes you an apology letter so you grade it to send it back\"\nUsing every teacher's trademark red pen, Nick went through the whole letter (yes, all four pages) and wrote notes in the margins giving his critique - and then gave her a grade at the end.\nHis ex had admitted that writing was the \"only way\" to get to him as she knows he \"doesn't want anything to do with her.\"\n\"I took you for granted, I begged for you back; and I ended up failing on my part and not holding up my end of everything we had,\" she wrote.\nGraded apology letter (Photo: @NickLutz12/Twitter) \"You showed me what it looked like when a guy truly loved a girl. You might regret everything between you and I. If I were you, I would too.\n\"I always complained that you were the one too immature and never taking anything seriously - seems like it was the other way around.\n\"I started irrelevant arguments. If there is one thing I never did to you no matter if you believe me or not - I never cheated on you. I promise that on everything. All of me, my mom, my Jeep, literally everything.\n\"I pushed you to your limits and you gave your all to me. I lost it all.\"\nGraded apology letter (Photo: @NickLutz12/Twitter) \"Honestly, I can't change anything that you heard; whether you believe what people have said or not.\"\nShe confessed that trying to move on was the \"hardest thing to do\" and she still struggles with it.\n\"I couldn't be more proud of the man you have become. I can't thank you enough for all you have done for me, both physically and emotionally.\n\"I've done so much thinking and growing as a person. It's all because of you.\"\nNick wasn't exactly sentimental about her words, crossing out some of her choice of phrasing and writing corrections in the margins about her \"useless fillers\" and repetition.\nGraded apology letter (Photo: @NickLutz12/Twitter) He eventually gave her a grade of D- with a total score of 61/100.\nHis analysis of her letter went as follows: \"Long intro, short conclusion. Strong hypothesis but nothing to back it up. Details are important.\n\"If you want to be believed, back it up with proof. You claimed that cheating never occurred, but place blame on yourself - then what for?\n\"Need to stop contradicting your own story and pick a side.\n\"While this gesture is appreciated, I would prefer details over statements.\"\nHis tweet went viral, receiving over 100,000 retweets and 300,000 likes, so lots of people have read his ex's letter by now.\nMirror Online has contacted Nick for comment.\n More On Relationships Viral Funny ha ha viral", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=DailyMirror"], "published": "2017-02-20T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:37:52.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
