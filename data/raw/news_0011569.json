Watch: Sasikala Natarajan pays... Tamil Nadu chief minister Jaya... CHENNAI: A team of doctors, who were involved in treatment of late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa , said on Monday that she had sepsis which caused organ failure leading to her death. \"Best treatment was given to Jayalalithaa, but her diabetes led to complications,\" Dr Richard Beale of UK, accompanied by other doctors, said while addressing a press conference in Chennai. \"For a period, she was treated with non-invasive ventilation and her initial condition improved somewhat, but as sepsis progressed, it was necessary for her to be put on ventilator. Later, she was fully interactive,\" Beale said, adding, \"There was no amputation and no transplantation either.\" Dousing rumours over her death, Beale clarified that during the initial days of her hospitalisation, \"she (Jaya) was certainly conscious and responding\", but her condition worsened unexpectedly. He explained that unlike popular belief, sepsis can develop 'extremely quickly', as in her case. When asked if Jayalalithaa was conscious when she signed the Election Commission's papers of her party nominee for November 19 bypoll to Thirupparankundram, the doctors said she was very much awake. \"She was conscious when she signed the Election Commission papers, she read the papers. Since she was very weak, she could not sign the paper and made the thumb impression instead,\" Apollo doctors said. On September 30, Dr Beale was flown to India, eight days after Jayalalithaa was admitted to Apollo Hospital . His area of expertise includes acute lung injury, sepsis and multi-organ failure. Dr Beale had left two days later but continued to be in touch with the medical team attending to Jayalalithaa.
