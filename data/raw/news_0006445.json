(Photo: Photo submitted by Buckingham Companies) \nA buffalo got its wild wings, and now no one knows where it's roaming. \nThe bison, a 5-foot-tall statue outside the CityWay development Downtown, is missing. \nBecca Manolov, director of community relations for Buckingham Companies , the developer behind CityWay, noticed the absence shortly after the first of the year. \n\"I was sad about it because we designed it with our 'love indy' logo, and we were eventually going to auction it off (for) our foundation,\" Manolov said. \"We were excited about it bringing more awareness for our 'love Indy' T-shirt campaign.\" \nPart of Indiana's \"Bison-tennial\" public art project to celebrate the state's 200th year, the bison had been in front of CityWay on Delaware and South streets, across from the CityWay YMCA, since mid-December. \nManolov doesn't think the bison's mysterious disappearance is anything more than late-night mischief, so Buckingham didn't file a police report. \n\"I'm thinking some people were drunk and loaded it in the back of their truck,\" she said, \"and it's like sitting in a house somewhere in Fountain Square.\" \nThe bison is made of fiberglass, so it's not as heavy as you might think, Manolov said. \n\"They're really not that heavy as big as they are,\" she said. \nThe apartment management company is taking a pretty lighthearted approach to searching for its wandering bison by sending out a \"missing bison\" tweet and posting about it in CityWay's blog under the header \"Keep the CityWay Bison's Memory Alive.\" \nThe blog urges people to keep donating to the foundation. But, \"In the meantime, if you do see him lying around, you know where to find us so we can bring him home.\" MISSING: @CityWayIndy 's bison has disappeared! Help us bring him home! pic.twitter.com/xoK5cV9Hjl â€” Buckingham Companies (@BuckinghamCo) January 19, 2017 \nBuckingham Foundation raises money to support the communities where its rental properties are located. The \"<3 Indy\" campaign, started in 2015, sells T-shirts with logos and donates the proceeds to childhood hunger prevention. \n\"The purpose of this bison was to promote the programs and services of the foundation,\" Manolov said. \"We're trying to do something good for the community.\" \nThe bison appeared last year in each of Indiana's 92 counties as part of the public art installation from the Indiana Association of United Ways. Property owners either commissioned artists to paint the white fiberglass statue or painted it themselves. The <3 Indy bison was a staff effort at Buckingham, Manolov said. \nCityWay's might be missing, but you can still see five other non-roaming bison in Marion County. \nCall Amy Bartner at (317) 444-6752 and follow her on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram . <!--iframe-->", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:23:56.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
