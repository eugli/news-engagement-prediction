Flamming | February 21, 2017 | 6:07pm Share Tweet Submit Pin \nEmma Watson is making the rounds on a press tour for her forthcoming movie Beauty and the Beast , and taking on a little fashion activism on the way. For the past few years, Watson has adopted sustainable fashion as one of her many causes. In 2016 Watson told CNN that to her, luxury meant “peace of mind”—in other words, luxury means knowing your clothes came from an ethical source. \nNow, Watson has taken her fashion activism to Instagram in a new account, @the_press_tour, which documents her Beauty and the Beast press tour, but more importantly promotes the chic sustainable fashion looks she wears along the way. The outfits includes pieces from environmentally and ethically conscious fashion companies like Stella McCartney, Filippa K., Boody, Oscar de la Renta and WORON. Watson lists every company that contributed to her looks, and how they are sustainable. She even documents her ethically conscious makeup brands, which include rms beauty, The Body Shop, VITA LIBERATA and jane iredale. \nThe account only has four photos up so far, but Watson looks flawless in all of them. Our favorite outfit might be the custom Louis Vuitton dress designed by Nicolas Ghesquiere and created from used plastic bottles.
