Nominated for six Oscars including best film and best supporting actor, the film releases in India on February 24. Sharda is part of the ensemble that includes Sunny Pawar, Priyanka Bose, Tannishtha Chatterjee. The actor talks about returning home to shoot Lion, and her next release Begum Jaan. \nTell us about your part in Lion. \nI play a character that Saroo Brierley (Dev Patel) comes across at a pivotal time in his life, when he commences his search for his identity. Having grappled myself with questions of cross-cultural identity between my Indian and Australian selves, I connected with it. \nHow did it feel to return home to shoot another film? \nIt was an amazing experience to shoot in my hometown of Melbourne for the first time. It was a treat to go home and have dinner with my father every night after shoot and to actually shoot in lecture theatres at the Melbourne University campus where I studied. One sequence was shot in a dance studio where I used to teach Indian dance on the University Campus. It was a real case of life going full circle. \nYou also star in the women ensemble drama Begum Jaan. Tell us about that experience. \nI feel very proud to have been part of such a stellar cast. Working with the likes of Vidya Balan, Ila Arun and Rajit Kapoor - you can't ask for more as an actor. It was a tough film to shoot. But being a story of human triumph, I felt that life mirrored the art we were making to a certain extent - we all banded together to create a product which is gut wrenching. I really enjoyed working under Srijit Mukherjee [director]. \nHow would you describe your journey in Bollywood so far? Are you happy with the roles coming your way? \nI am very pleased to have been able to experiment so vastly with different characters and genres. From Dus Tola to Save Your Legs, Lion, Begum Jaan and all the films in between, my repertoire has been incredibly diverse. It was always my intention to be a versatile performer, that is what my time as a theatre and stage performer taught me. When I was starting out a lot of people found my approach incongruous, assuming that genres of films were mutually exclusive, but I have always maintained that working across so many genres and territories makes for a more interesting career.
