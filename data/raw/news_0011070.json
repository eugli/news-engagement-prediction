Akeredolu, SAN, has led some chieftains of his All Progressives Congress, APC to meet with Governor Olusegun Mimiko on the protracted crisis in the House of Assembly. \nDependable source told Vanguard that all the grey areas have been resolved and that the budget may be presented this week. \nSome politicians, within and outside the state, have been accused of masterminding the crisis in the Assembly. Rotimi-Akeredolu \nHoodlums were allegedly hired to protest against the presentation of this year’s budget by Governor Segun Mimiko, last weekend and even attacked the governor’s convoy. \nThe unnamed politicians are also fingered in the sack of the principal officers of the Assembly over an alleged N15 million fraud. \nSeven of the protesters were ordered by an Akure Chief Magistrate court last weekend to be remanded in prison custody for attacking the governor’s convoy. \nAkeredolu was said to have visited the governor to apologize on behalf of his party members and to exonerate himself from the attack on the governor and the crisis in the Assembly. \nSources hinted that he promised to “Whip to line troublesome members of his party” and commended the governor for being tolerant of the excesses of such members. \nAkeredolu was said to have told the governor that the crisis in the Assembly was uncalled for. \nHe was however quoted as saying that of necessity, the Speaker, Jumoke Akindele will have to vacate the seat after his inauguration on the 24th because she hails from same area with the incoming deputy governor, Agboola Ajayi. \nThe governor-elect was said to have arrived the government house by 8pm and left at about 9pm after a closed door meeting with the governor. \nAkeredolu was later shown round the government lodge by the governor ahead of his inauguration. \nMeanwhile, The former Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Alhaji Ali Olanusi weekend cautioned Mimiko against interfering in the affairs of the state Assembly. \nOlanusi spoke with newsmen in Akure after he was honoured as the grand patron of Road Transport Employers of Association of Nigeria (RTEAN). adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:28:44.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
