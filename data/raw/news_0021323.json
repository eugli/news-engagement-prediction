(AP) More The Miami Heat are waiving former No. 2 overall pick Derrick Williams to clear a roster spot to sign forward Okaro White to a two-year contract, league sources told The Vertical.\nThe Heat faced a roster decision Monday because White’s second 10-day contract had expired under a hardship exception that allowed the team to add an extra player. Miami explored trade options to move Williams before deciding to release the six-year veteran.\nWhite’s progress from the Heat’s NBA Development League affiliate in Sioux Falls to NBA contributor again showed the team’s ability to develop players. Hassan Whiteside and Tyler Johnson followed a similar path in 2014. White is an energetic 6-foot-8 forward who is shooting 46.2 percent from 3-point range. He has averaged 4.1 points, 2.6 rebounds and 16.4 minutes in nine games for the Heat.\nMiami, which has won 10 consecutive games, visits Minnesota on Monday and is two games from the eighth seed in the Eastern Conterence with a 21-30 record.\nWilliams, 25, signed a one-year, $4.6 million deal with the Heat last summer after a solid season with the New York Knicks . He averaged 5.9 points and 2.9 rebounds in 25 games (11 starts) for Miami.\nWilliams also played with Minnesota and Sacramento after being the second overall pick out of Arizona in 2011. He has averaged 9.1 points and 4.1 rebounds for his career.\nMore NBA coverage from The Vertical:", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MleLt00j4Yry.8Tjluv5ug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NjI2/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/514135ee560381c988fd4f1d25aca6db", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pnr-wp/2017/02/06115421/AP_16327129496750.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-07T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:32:29.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
