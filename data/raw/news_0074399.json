If it were to happen, it’d be very interesting, to say the least. \n“Him on the mic is unmatched in the UFC, so who knows. You never know.” \nMcGregor hasn’t completely ruled out a WrestleMania appearance, so who knows, you may even catch him dancing in the ring with the hosts in Orlando on April 2. \nWould you like to see Conor McGregor in WWE?
