But last fall, the season 15 Mirrorball Trophy winner took a break for personal reasons. \n“It was time to take a little bit of a break. My sister actually went through breast cancer. She beat it,” Dovolani says in the exclusive clip. “She went through a couple weeks of chemo and six weeks of radiation, so it was a long one. Unfortunately, my aunt was not so lucky. So I had a few misfortunes happen in our family. But we are at the other side of it, which I’m really happy.” \nSo, will the fan-favorite dancer return to the ballroom anytime soon? \n“I miss Dancing , of course I love the show,” Dovolani says about the reality series, and hints, “and of course I might do another season.” \nAnd although the pro dancer took a season-long break from the show, his dancing skills are still showoff-worthy! \nAfter giving audiences a glimmer of hope that he might return, the season 7 partners — who last danced eight years ago — performed a salsa number for the Hallmark series. \nDovolani’s episode of Home & Family airs Friday at 10 a.m. ET on Hallmark Channel.
