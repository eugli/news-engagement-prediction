She was shot dead in her Cape Town flat in June 2005. \nHendricks pleaded not guilty and the NPA's case had been withdrawn. \nAn inquest in 2008 suggested that she had committed suicide but her family refused to believe that and launched a private prosecution. \nIt was South Africa's first murder conviction by private prosecution. \nNel refused to identify the cases he is considering taking on but The Times understands that they include those involving acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane, Hawks head Lieutenant-General Berning Ntlemeza, former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe and SA Airways board chairman Dudu Myeni - all of whom are knee deep in allegations of corruption and maladministration. \nNel is one of this country's top criminal prosecutors. He successfully prosecuted former national police commissioner Jackie Selebi for corruption and Paralympian Pistorius for murder. \nAfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel, making the announcement yesterday of the formation by his organisation of the private prosecutions team, denied that it was being done in pursuit of a political agenda . \n\"It is about ensuring that justice is delivered to all South Africans,\" said Nel. \nHe said his decision had not been taken lightly. \nThe focus of the team, which Nel said would include other top prosecutors, would be to ensure that corruption cases unreasonably withdrawn were prosecuted.

If the NPA decides to prosecute we have no right to prosecute and our job will be done. We have 100% faith in South Africa's criminal justice system, we just want to help them,\" he said. \nBut he said public perception was that the NPA had been selective in some of its prosecutions. \n\"That is what we are here to test. We hope it will not be the case. \n\"People involved in corruption, regardless of their status, must understand that they will be looked at.\" \nNel said a certificate had to be granted before a private prosecution could go ahead. \n\"We must show good reasons why we want to prosecute. Once we have the certificate we have three months in which to bring the matter to court.\" \nAsked about the possibility that the NPA would delay issuing certificates, Nel said that then an appeal to a court would be made. \n\"If we believe there needs to be a prosecution, then we will prosecute. We will not be stopped.\" \nLlewelyn Curlewis, vice-chairman of the SA Law Society's criminal law committee, said nothing in law could stop the establishment of a private prosecutions team.
