She looked like a little angel. I found out after I married her that she is an angel.‚Äù \nRuthie told the Today show all about the satin dress, which the couple bought for $39.99 many years ago. \n‚ÄúIt has lace around the waistline, over the hips and down the back, and of course, lots of buttons... I worked so hard to make the money to buy it,‚Äù she said. \nAfter six decades together, the dress (and Ruthie!) still looks as gorgeous as ever. Watch the rest of the video above to see what the McCoy‚Äôs looked like on their wedding day. \nThe HuffPost Lifestyle newsletter will make you happier and healthier, one email at a time.
