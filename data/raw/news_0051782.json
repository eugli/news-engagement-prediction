Article continues below \nFrom there, SWP cost a terribly advised QPR £2 million up front, with a £60,00-a-week, three-year contract to boot. \nThe 36-time England international would take a few days shy of a year to score his first goal for QPR - which then came in the League Cup against Walsall - and spent the last 18 months or so of his time at Loftus Road on the bench or in the stands.
