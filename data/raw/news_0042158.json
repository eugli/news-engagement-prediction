Of course you would,\" he said.\nGlobal trend Between 2013 and 2016, donors who tested positive for drugs when they died grew from about seven per cent to 22 per cent. These included all drugs, not just fentanyl, and do not mean the donor died from a drug overdose.\nA similar trend has been taking place in recent years in the United States, most notably in New England.\nResearch conducted by the U.S. Health Department shows that between 2012 and 2016, the number of transplants coming from donors who died due to \"drug intoxication\" more than doubled, from five per cent to 12 per cent.\nMore than 25 per cent of all deceased donors died from drug intoxication in the northeastern region in 2016, compared to 12 per cent in 2012. The area encompasses Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.\nThe Canadian Institute of Health Information says 2,580 transplants were performed across the country in 2015. More than 4,700 patients waited for a transplant that year, while 21 either withdrew or died while on the waitlist.\nÂ© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-18T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:21:07.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
