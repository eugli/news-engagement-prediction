It is not known if these were connected to the bagels. Image copyright Twitter Image caption British Transport Police tweeted about the disturbance \nBritish Transport Police (BTP) tweeted about so-called \"BagelGate\", telling passengers: \"Let's be clear, no bagel should be treated so cruelly. And no one subjected to intimidating behaviour.\" \nThe video of the incident has been liked 17,000 times and had more than 10,000 retweets. \nA spokeswoman for Great Northern, the operator of the 00:54 service from King's Cross to Huntingdon, said: \"We take all incidents of intimidating behaviour on our services very seriously and encourage passengers to report them to the BTP.\" \nNo arrests have been made.
