Julia Rampen spent a day eating meals made from leftover pancake batter Share Comments By Julia Rampen 10:47, 28 FEB 2017 Updated 10:51, 28 FEB 2017 Money Julia spent a day eating pancakes money Pancake Day - possibly the best ever ‘special day’ invented. OK, so it originally marked the start of fasting , but these days it’s basically a licence to chuck batter around your kitchen.\nPancakes are also cheap. In fact, you can make them for as little as 3p a pop . So if you’re on a tight budget, you may want to get the frying pan out more often.\nAnd you don’t have to *just* eat banana pancakes with maple syrup and ice cream. Pat Parker, who runs a budget recipe group on Facebook , once told me: \"There are so many things you can make with eggs, flour and sugar.\"\nRead More Pancake Day 2017 What is Pancake Day?

How to flip pancakes guide Best Nutella pancakes Where to eat best pancakes in UK After cooking up some traditional pancakes for breakfast, I tried out some different ways to use up the batter, and this is what I discovered.\n1. Pancake soup When I first announced I was making pancake soup, my housemates were not exactly salivating. “Is that like whizzed-up pancakes?” one asked.\nNo, you’ll probably be relieved to learn. Actually, it’s more like minestrone soup. You cut up the pancake into thin strips and add it to a clear broth made from stock and a few herbs. I adapted this recipe here .\nVerdict: This was a pretty nourishing lunch, and the pancakes were the tastiest part. Next time I’ll add some more flavour to the soup.\n2. Sweetcorn fritters I’ve always been a fan of sweetcorn fritters, but I’ve usually made the batter from scratch. This time, I just dumped a tin of sweetcorn and some spring onions in leftover pancake mix.\nI used this recipe as a base , but I didn’t quite get the quantities right. After a couple of sloppy attempts, though, my fritters were sizzling away.\nVerdict: This was the winner. Even the messy fritters were delicious. And served up with salad they actually looked quite fancy.\n3. Baked pancakes I found a lot of recipes for baked, stuffed pancakes. You take your leftover pancakes, spoon something savoury in the middle, roll them up and bake them in the oven.\nI liked the look of this spinach and ricotta bake , although in the end I used goat’s cheese instead.\nVerdict: Filling, and tasty - although I think it would be even tastier with a topping of melted cheddar cheese.\n4. Pancake cake Yes, it’s a thing. My typing blunder conjured up multiple visions of layered pancakes, stuck together with jam or Nutella.\nIt didn’t look that appetising though, so I checked out layer cake recipes and decided to cook my pancake cake in the oven. I grilled a layer of batter, topped it with jam and another spoon of batter, and grilled again.\nVerdict: It STILL didn’t look that appetising, but it was yummy. Once cut up into bite-size chunks it disappeared within seconds.\n Money Newsletter Follow @MirrorMoney Subscribe to our Money Pancake Day Food Save money", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://www.notquitenigella.com/2008/09/05/pancake-soup/", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "http://www.abc.net.au/tv/pohskitchen/stories/s2914271.htm", "http://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/recipes/137296/Sweetcorn-fritters", "http://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/baked-spinach-and-ricotta-pancakes/3683.html", "http://i3.scotlandnow.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article7316299.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/GettyImages-540830297.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorMoney", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrormoneysaving"], "published": "2017-02-28T12:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:12:52.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
