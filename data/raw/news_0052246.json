We pleaded with them that it was beyond our capacity and they agreed to persuade the groom. We made all preparations for the wedding, but on the fixed date the groom’s family claimed that he refused to get married and he has gone missing,” Rajesh mentioned in the police complaint. \nHe said the bride’s family gifted costly jewellery, beds, LED, scooter, clothes and utensils on February 13 and made preparations for a baraat (wedding procession) of around 600 people on February 15. \nRajesh claimed that both families met at Farrukhnagar police station but the groom’s family refused to budge from its stand. “Outside the police station, they also threatened us with dire consequences,” he claimed in the police complaint. \n“We have arrested Pradeep and he is on a one-day police remand. Action will be taken against other accused also after investigation,” said inspector Satender Singh, SHO, Dharuhera police station. \nPradeep, his father, mother, and sister were booked under the Dowry Prohibition act 1961, and relevant sections of the Indian PenalCode, including 406 (criminal breach of trust), and 506 (criminal intimidation). tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:27:05.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
