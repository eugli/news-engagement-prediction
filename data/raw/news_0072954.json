When we last checked in the talented kids at the center of the story, they were enjoying their recent successes: The Get Down Brothers triumphed over the Notorious Three in a rap battle, and Mylene and The Soul Madonnas signed their first record deal after their song “Set Me Free” became a radio hit. \nBased on the new teaser, this is just the beginning for these kids from the South Bronx. “We’re gonna take our music from minor to major league,” says Shaolin Fantastic (Shameik Moore) in the short clip, which teases several of the wild performances we’ll see when the show returns. \nPart Two picks up a year after the midseason finale in 1978 and finds young lovers Zeke (Justice Smith) and Mylene (Herizen Guardiola) caught in the middle of a cultural revolution as hip-hop’s ascendancy continues, thereby challenging disco music’s reign. Books and Mylene will depend on each other as they continue to pursue their dreams against a fraught backdrop that includes a bankrupt New York City, ruthless gangsters, and money-hungry record label bosses. \nWatch the teaser above. \nIf you want to catch up on The Get Down before it returns, read our recaps of season 1, part 1 here.
