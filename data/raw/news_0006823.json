Picture: Barry Tuton Walkers left stunned by man’s early morning skinny dip at popular beach Erin Smith, Redcliffe & Bayside Herald February 1, 2017 5:00pm \nEARLY morning walkers north of Brisbane were given quite a shock after a man wearing just his birthday suit strolled through a popular park and into the water. \nThe man was spotted by Woody Point resident Barry Tuton while out walking at the southern tip of the Redcliffe Peninsula about 5am on Tuesday. \nMr Tuton said he had walked the same route for three years and had never seen anything like it before. \n“I was very surprised,” Mr Tuton said. \n“He just walked straight passed me, through Crockatt Park, naked as the day he was born. \n“He went down to the water, splashed around for a bit then walked in the shallows towards Clontarf.” \nMr Tuton said a few other walkers were equally as surprised by the man’s actions. \n“You don’t see that every day,” Mr Tuton said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:13:02.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
