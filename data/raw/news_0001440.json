Just this morning, Trump tweeted that there were \"a lot of bad 'dudes' out there\" and that, \"if the ban were announced with a one week notice, the 'bad' would rush into our country during that week\" – despite that a majority of the \"bad dudes\" attacking America are, well, other Americans . \nIf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! It's worth noting that obtaining entry into the U.S. as a refugee before Trump's ban was already an extensive process that takes an average of 18 to 24 months. Meanwhile, visa applications for those visiting the U.S. under a nonimmigrant visa can take up to 60 days to process — quite the opposite of the one-week-bad-dude image Trump paints. The list of countries Trump has banned travel from, oddly enough, doesn't include a single country he has business ties to or countries whose nationals carried out the 9/11 attacks. \npink: where Trump Org has done business, or had companies set up to do so green: travel ban countries (no overlap) https://t.co/ZqqfM64aiQ Like us on Facebook: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:18:06.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
