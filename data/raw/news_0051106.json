We will never repeat the terrible mistake of Resolution 2334 and allow one-sided Security Council resolutions to condemn Israel. Instead, we will push for action on the real threats we face from the Middle East,\" she said. \"We stand for peace,\" she continued. \"We support a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that is negotiated directly between the two parties, as President Trump reiterated in his meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\" skip - \"U.S. is determined to stand up to the UN’s anti-Israel bias\" - Nikki Haley \"U.S. is determined to stand up to the UN’s anti-Israel bias\" - Nikki Haley She also blasted the UN Security Council for focusing its efforts on the Palestinians while giving low priority to other issues, like like Iran: \"Incredibly, the UN Department of Political Affairs has an entire division devoted to Palestinian affairs… There is no division devoted to illegal missile launches from North Korea... no division devoted to the world’s number one state-sponsor of terror, Iran. The prejudiced approach to Israeli-Palestinian issues does the peace process no favors . \"The double standards are breathtaking,\" she said.

In fact, it’s sometimes at its worst” In the May 2013 comments, Rice described Israel as enduring “a barrage of obsessive, unbalanced, and relentless criticism” at the United Nations. “That undermines the trust between the parties that [the U.S.] is working so hard to build,” she said. “It also undermines the UN’s own highest values. The UN should be a place where conflicts are cooled, not inflamed - where confidence is built, not eroded.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:24:44.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
