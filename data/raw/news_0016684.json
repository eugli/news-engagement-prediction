Madeline Kenney Sign-Up for our News & Politics Newsletter Sign-Up \nA police car dashcam video captured a meteor streaking through the sky in Lisle earlier this morning. \nWhile Lisle police officer Jim Dexter was on patrol at 1:25 a.m. he noticed a meteor in the sky and realized he was lucky enough to have the dashboard camera on his patrol car record the sighting. \n“In this profession, we see so many things that the public doesn’t get too see. Sometimes that’s good, sometimes that’s bad. I’m just glad that in this instance I was able to capture this for everyone to see,” Dexter said in a statement. \nThe National Weather Service in Chicago tweeted Dexter’s video of the meteor, which appeared to be a bright flash of green and blue light.

Multiple people tweeted the weather service back and said there were meteor spottings in Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin. \nA Morton Grove police dashcam also caught a glimpse of the breathtaking meteor, which the weather service shared on Twitter.
