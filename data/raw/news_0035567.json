Prosecutors contend that Mr. Durst shot her in the back of her head in order to prevent her from revealing what she knew about the disappearance of Kathleen Durst. \nAdvertisement   As Mr. Chavin spoke, a frail-looking Mr. Durst, 73, sat next to the head of his legal team, Dick DeGuerin, who has repeatedly said that his client did not kill Ms. Berman and does not know who did. The case against Mr. Durst is circumstantial; there were no witnesses to Ms. Berman’s death. And Mr. Durst has never been charged in connection with his wife’s disappearance. Her body has not turned up, and there is no official crime scene. With the actual trial still as much as a year away, Mr. Chavin’s testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court was part of an unusual proceeding known as a conditional examination. Prosecutors can question witnesses before trial if they are 65 or older and in danger of dying or being killed before the case is heard. Defense lawyers have the right to cross-examine such witnesses, and the proceedings are videotaped in case the witnesses are not available to testify at trial. The prosecution has wider latitude in questioning witnesses, but how much of the testimony will be admitted at trial is determined later. Until this week, Mr. Chavin, who will be cross-examined Friday, had been referred to in hearings as the “mystery witness,” because his identity had not been publicly revealed. In explaining the need to take his testimony, Deputy District Attorney John Lewin told Superior Court Judge Mark E. Windham that Mr. Durst, whose net worth is estimated at $100 million, “kills witnesses.” “When pushed into a corner,” Mr. Lewis said, “he murders people.” In interviews with The New York Times over the past 17 years , Mr. Chavin described his friend, whom he called Bobby, as a “genius” with an innate understanding of real estate, a dry sense of humor and some “eccentric” habits. Mr. Durst was a best man at Mr. Chavin’s 1988 wedding. Only months earlier, Mr. Chavin had introduced Mr. Durst to the woman who would become his second wife, Debrah Lee Charatan. Mr. Chavin has worked for the Durst Organization ; his wife, Terry Chavin, had worked for Ms. Charatan before joining the company as a real estate agent. Mr. Chavin’s decision to become a witness for the prosecution two years ago represented a remarkable and difficult turnabout in his 35-year friendship with Mr. Durst. \nAdvertisement   Mr. Chavin testified that Mr. Durst’s admission during a 2003 murder trial in Galveston, Tex., that he had sat in a pool of blood and dismembered the body of a neighbor whom he had killed, shook the “primary foundations” of his belief that Mr. Durst could not have committed a violent act. Although Mr. Durst was acquitted in that case after telling the jury that his neighbor’s death was an accident that happened during a struggle to defend himself, Mr. Chavin said he found Mr. Durst’s testimony “shocking.” Mr. Chavin’s friendship with Ms. Berman came first. He testified that he was an aspiring musician in California fronting a raunchy band, Country Porn, in the late 1970s when he met Ms. Berman, then a reporter for The San Francisco Examiner who wrote several stories about the band. “We felt like kindred spirits,” Mr. Chavin recalled during testimony that began Wednesday. But Mr. Chavin decided in 1980 that it was time to get a “day job” and moved to New York, where Ms. Berman was already working as a magazine writer. Mr. Chavin, who had a graduate degree in creative writing, quickly got a job as a copywriter at an advertising agency. Ms. Berman introduced him to Mr. Durst, whom she had met in Los Angeles in the late 1960s when they were both attending the University of California. The three friends went out to nightclubs, concerts and ballet performances. Mr. Durst also helped Mr. Chavin propel his real estate advertising career with a $400,000-a-year account to advertise a new skyscraper built by the Durst family at 1155 Avenue of the Americas.

Sometimes Mr. Chavin and a girlfriend — he was separated from his first wife — would double date with Mr. Durst and Kathleen. Other times, Mr. Chavin testified, Mr. Durst brought along another woman. “He described his marriage as ‘open,’” Mr. Chavin testified. Kathleen Durst, in turn, confided to Mr. Chavin that she was “afraid” of Mr. Durst, Mr. Chavin told the court. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.
