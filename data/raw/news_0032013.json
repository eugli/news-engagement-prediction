Her sentence would end in just four years, and she can come back to haunt the party. \n\nBelow are the five reasons why the SC verdict may not be the end of Sasikala: \n\n1. Given how smoothly she staged a putsch against Panneerselvam to replace him as Jayalalitha's political heir, Sasikala will continue to have friends within the party even if she is in jail and OPS is the chief minister. \n\n2. Since OPS can never have Jayalalithaa's mass appeal and the kind of control she had over the party, rebels will keep rocking the AIADMK boat. Sasikala can become the rallying point for these rebels. \n\n3. Sasikala will be out of jail in four years, which is a not a big gap in politics. Once out, she will do everything to split the party. \n\n4. The SC verdict may not be all bad for Sasikala. If Panneerselvam were able to lure majority party MLAs, it would have proved that party had no faith in Sasikala. The masses too would have accepted that. But now the message that would go to the masses is—Sasikala has been stopped from heading the state by a court order but not due to lack of support in the party. So when she is back, she can still have popular support. \n\n5. Sasikala has once proved to the people that she is Jayalalithaa's legitimate successor. After four years, when she is out of jail, the situation in the state might be very conducive for her power play. Panneerselvam will be facing rebellions as well as anti-incumbency. He cannot have the mass support Jayalalithaa had so the party's base will only erode from now on. All this will help Sasikala project herself as the next mass leader.   Price of power: How much is Sasikala’s resort bill? of 6 Next Prev Play Slideshow The supreme verdict 14 Feb, 2017 The Supreme Court found Sasikala guilty in infamous Disproportionate Asset case. The verdict has ended her dream to become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Here is how much she has spent trying to safeguard 100 legislators, for six days and nights at a luxurious beach resort on East Coast Road: Rooms 14 Feb, 2017 There are about 60 rooms of three different types at the Golden Bay beach resort, tranquil rooms costing Rs 5,500 per day, bay view rooms Rs 6,600 per day and paradise suite rooms for Rs 9,900. Considering that all the rooms were booked at a tariff of Rs 7,000 flat for mass booking, the boarding expenses alone might run up to roughly Rs 25 lakh for six days. High spirits 14 Feb, 2017 This figure does not include food, water, snacks, fruits and other essential items besides non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. Sources said every night was filled with entertainment programmes to keep the MLAs in high spirits, maybe literally too. If each of these 200 people staying at the resort consumed food and beverage on an average of Rs 2,000 per day, the bill will be another Rs 25 lakh for six days. Perks 14 Feb, 2017 All the legislators were shifted to the resort after the meeting on Wednesday night and did not plan a long stay. Sources said the MLAs and those staying at the resort were given new clothes and if a rough estimate that each person staying was given alternative clothing for Rs 1,000 per day, it would cost another Rs 12 lakh for six days. Luxurious resort 14 Feb, 2017 Besides the basic amenities, the luxurious resort offers 24 hour room service and an array of services like direct dial telephones, two individual balconies with seating and an individual lounge area in every room to entertain visitors. The resort, located near the backwaters, has special facilities for differently-abled people, storage facilities and offers many other conveniences.
