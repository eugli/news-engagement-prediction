But one day I will, hopefully.” ALSO READ: Brazilian Superstar Fabinho linked with move to Premier League \nWill Florentin and Paul swap shirts at the end of Saint-Etienne's game against United? \n“I’ve never asked a player to swap jerseys at the end of the game, although I do have some because when I’ve played against friends we’ve just sort of swapped spontaneously,\" Florentin added. \"I think that after this game there’ll be a quite natural exchange of shirts.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:14:10.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
