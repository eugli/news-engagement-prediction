The next step is to take the perfect photo. By Brooke Prelovsky Thursday, February 2, 2017, 9:22 am It’s common knowledge that “it’s not official until you Instagram it.” Well, maybe not, but posting shots to social media does give us the perfect opportunity to share big milestones, exciting moments, and great accomplishments—like the end of a race! As a huge fan of both runDisney and Instagram, I’ve compiled quite a few “bling shots” over the years. This year’s Dopey Challenge was no exception. Here, I’m sharing a few of my favorites, along with some instructions so you can create your own. I hope you enjoy and get some inspiration from them for your own races! 1/13 Robert James Reese Add Some Action \nI tried to get Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde to go for a jog with me—and my brand new 2017 Dopey Challenge medals—but Nick Wilde was too lazy to play along. Still, it made for a fun photo! 2/13 Photograph courtesy of Brooke Prelovsky In Front of Spaceship Earth \nMost runDisney races, including all of the Walt Disney World Marathon weekend races, end with Spaceship Earth as a big indicator that “you’re almost there!” So, what better way to celebrate than by displaying your medal proudly in front of this beautiful icon? This medal was earned at the 2014 Wine and Dine Half Marathon. 3/13 Photograph courtesy of Brooke Prelovsky With Your Favorite Disney Dessert \nAfter you’ve run all the miles, you deserve all the desserts. Make sure to document it! I LOVE this cannoli available at Tutto Gusto in the Italy Pavillion and I celebrated 2016’s Dopey Challenge by indulging. 4/13 Photograph courtesy of Brooke Prelovsky With Starbucks \nAt Walt Disney World, you can be whoever you want to be when ordering your coffee. Whether you’re Dopey, Goofy, or any other character—make your drink extra special and you’ll have another prop for a social-media-worthy shot. I took this one in January 2015 after I ran my first Dopey Challenge. 5/13 Photograph courtesy of Brooke Prelovsky The Bib & Medal Shot \nrunDisney bibs can be just as pretty as the medals—arrange them and snap away. This combo of the Disneyland Half’s 10th anniversary and Disneyland Resort’s 60th anniversary in 2015 was too perfect not to post. I’ve taken pictures like this with race shirts too (when the bib was too beat up after the race). 6/13 Photograph courtesy of Brooke Prelovsky When Your Medal Matches the Landscape \nIn September, I ran the inaugural Disneyland Paris Half Marathon and it was certainly once in a lifetime experience! I loved the medals and especially loved how the Half Marathon medal featured Le Chateau de la Belle au Bois Dormant (Sleeping Beauty Castle) so I needed to get the perfect shot. 7/13 Photograph courtesy of Brooke Prelovsky Your Crowning Moment \nThis shot will take a running buddy or a willing bystander but it’s one of my favorites. There are few moments like receiving your medal after a race so why not try to capture it? This particular one was after the runDisney Enchanted 10K in 2015. 8/13 Photograph courtesy of Brooke Prelovsky Coast to Coast “Money Shot” \nIf you’ve earned a Coast to Coast runDisney medal—if you ran a half marathon or longer in Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort—you need to get a picture of your medal in front of the “Partners” statue of Walt and Mickey—they’re featured on the bling and it makes for a fun, shareable shot. 9/13 Photograph courtesy of Brooke Prelovsky With the Big Cheese Himself \nAfter a runDisney race it’s tradition to wear your medals around the parks. It’s a fun way to celebrate your accomplishments and can lead to come awesome character interactions. I have so many fun pictures with my favorite characters but I always try and see my favorite—Mickey! The one on the left is after my first Disneyland Half in 2015 and the one on the right was taken after last year’s 48.6. Don’t forget to say “Cheese!” 10/13 Photograph courtesy of Brooke Prelovsky In Front of Cinderella Castle \nThis is a must. If you can get multiple medals in the shot, even better. Cinderella Castle is one of the most photographed subjects in the world, so if you want a unique shot, you’ll have to get creative. This shot features my 2016 runDisney Glass Slipper Challenge medals. 11/13 Photograph courtesy of Brooke Prelovsky I Run for Mickey Waffles \nIn my opinion, everything tastes better with ears—especially after you’ve completed a runDisney challenge! Whether you run for Mickey waffles, Mickey ice cream, a Mickey pretzel, or a Mickey cookie, make sure you brag about it. The best part—they’re so photogenic! This was my balcony breakfast post Lumiere’s Two Course Challenge this past November. 12/13 Photograph courtesy of Brooke Prelovsky Everyone Stared at Me for This One \nYou may get a few stares, but it’s totally worth it. I love staying in the parks after closing to see the crowds dwindle and to take advantage of once in a lifetime shots like this. I call this one “Dopey made me Happy!” What better way is there to show off your medals than by laying them out on Main Street USA and giving a big cheesy “I DID IT” grin? The answer is—there is no better way. So lay down and smile proudly! You’ll never see those people again anyway. 13/13 Photograph courtesy of Brooke Prelovsky Don’t Forget the Outtakes \nEvery time I see this picture, I get a good laugh. After my first Dopey Challenge in 2015, I was determined to get the most perfect social-media-worthy bling shot of my six newly earned medals, but things got a little dangerous when I leaned on a gate in the Rose Garden. Thankfully this perfect moment was captured and I didn’t drop the bling! Don’t be afraid to share the funny moments—they make for the best memories.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:35:17.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
