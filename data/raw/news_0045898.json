Balasubramaniam, was because the freedom to practise one’s religion was enshrined in the Constitution. \n“This Bill has nothing to do with non-Muslims. \n“What is there to be worried about?” he asked. \nBalasubramaniam assured non-Muslims that their religious freedom would not be affected. \nRelated stories:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:19:03.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
