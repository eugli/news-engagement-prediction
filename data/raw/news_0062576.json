(Photo: Jackie Molloy/IndyStar) Buy Photo\n101 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE A proposed tax increase that would pay for a mass transit expansion in Indianapolis is approaching its final hurdle.\nThe Rules and Public Policy Committee on Tuesday approved the 0.25 percent income tax hike, sending it to the full City-County Council. The council is expected to vote on the issue at its Feb. 27 meeting.\nThe panel approved the tax hike 5-2, with opposition from Democrat Monroe Gray and Republican Jeff Coats.\nGray suggested there is a lack of demand for bus service in Indianapolis. Looking out at the 50-plus people who attended the committee meeting at 38th Street and Lafayette Road, Gray asked who had arrived on bus. Only two people raised their hands.\n\"Part of this contract depends on how much the fare box produces,\" Gray said of the county's transit plan, asserting it could suffer from low ridership.\nBut City-County Council President Maggie Lewis, a supporter of the transit tax, countered that few people could have reached the meeting by using Marion County's substandard bus service.\n\"One would think that the reason folks are not here (on bus) is because of the (route) frequency, or lack thereof, to get to a meeting at 5:30 in the evening and get home,\" Lewis said.\nIf approved, the transit tax would cost $125 a year for someone earning $50,000. It would go into effect in October and generate an estimated $54.4 million in its first full year.\nMarion County's transit agency, IndyGo, says the money is necessary to support a long-overdue expansion to the mass transit system. Improvements would include the acquisition of new buses, increased route frequency, new shelters and new sidewalks across the county.\nCritics, though, have noted that improvements to the bus system could be delayed for years if the city loses a $75 million federal grant that was awarded last year to Indianapolis. The federal money is slated to cover most of the first phase of a north-south bus rapid transit route called the Red Line.\nIndyGo plans to build the Red Line and two other rapid transit lines with or without federal money. That means improvements to existing bus routes could be pushed back three years, until 2021, if the once-promised federal money evaporates. Congress last year did not pass a budget that included the grant and the Trump administration has yet to share its transportation priorities.\nIndyGo spokesman Bryan Luellen stressed that the full Marion County transit plan will be implemented regardless of the federal grant.\n\"It would just take a little longer to build,\" he said.\nThe proposed transit tax already has cleared several hurdles, including a voter referendum in November. Nearly 60 percent of Marion County voters supported the transit tax. The proposal won in 19 of 25 City-County Council districts.\nMayor Joe Hogsett's chief of staff, Thomas Cook, told committee members that the mayor plans to sign the transit tax if it's approved by the full council.\nSpeaking of the referendum, Cook said, \"We believe thatâ€™s a message that was delivered to (Hogsett) as well as (the council).\"\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn IndyGo's winning design for Red Line station Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
