WOW! @BonniesMBB drills a three with .4 left. The fans storm the court, a technical foul is called. Now we're in OT. https://t.co/rQy1tTc835 \n— CBS Sports Network (@CBSSportsNet) February 4, 2017 \nSt. Bonaventure students rushed the court, unaware that .4 seconds remained on the clock. After much ado, the court was cleared and the Bonnies were assessed a technical foul for fan interference. The ensuing free throw awarded to VCU tied the game and sent it overtime, where the Bonnies would lose, 83-77. \nThis is about the toughest way imaginable to lose a basketball game, and now we must all prepare for a worse menace: the gale of court-rushing takes that will descend upon sports media over the next seven days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:46:36.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
