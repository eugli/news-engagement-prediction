Daily Edition IMDb to Shut Down Discussion Boards 1:17 PM PST 2/3/2017 by Mia Galuppo The boards will remain open for two more weeks, until Feb. 19. \nIMDb is shutting down its longtime discussion boards. \nIn a statement posted to its website, the company said that the decision was made \"only after careful consideration and was based on data and traffic.\" Adding, \"We have concluded that IMDb's message boards are no longer providing a positive, useful experience.\" \nThe boards will remain open for two more weeks, until Feb. 19, for what the Amazon-owned company describes as a \"small but passionate community of IMDb users.\" As a part of the shut down, users will no longer be able to send personal messages to one another. \nIMDb cites 250 million monthly users, worldwide. The company says that the lack of discussion board traffic is because users have taken to the site's social media accounts -- Twitter, Instagram, etc. -- to engage with one another. \nThe decision to shut down the discussion boards comes at a time when IMDb's user-driven feature is coming under fire. \nThe viability of IMDb's user voting system has been called into question, as the ratings of movies by minority filmmakers receive a disproportionate amount of negative ratings, which are measure by stars, on a scale from one to ten. Today, some Twitter users have singled out Raoul Peck's Oscar-nominated doc I Am Not Your Negro as a recent example of this issue. \nThe doc hit theaters today and has already received 409 one-star votes from users, as compared to 318 ten-star votes, with a nominal number of votes in-between.
