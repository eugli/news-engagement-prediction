'The experience in relationships had broken me down, and I ended up losing all my self-worth, confidence and purpose. I suffered from bad skin conditions, lost my job and became ill due to the stress and anxiety I had. Shrinking: Vikki has dropped two dress sizes (pictured in December 2015, left, and January 2017, right) after ditching McDonald's breakfasts and chocolate for a healthy diet 'I gained a lot of weight once I had lost my job due to stress and feeling insecure after my break up. Food was my comfort.' Vikki says she was conscious of her weight from the age of 10, when a cruel bully told her she had 'double knees' - which led to her avoiding clothes that would show her legs above the knee. After losing her job in sales, Vikki decided to do a course to become a makeup artist, and when she saw unflattering pictures of herself online she finally decided to make a drastic change. Vikki took these photos of herself at the start of her weight loss journey to track her progress. She signed up to her local gym in January 2016, which 'felt like a different world' The makeup artist shows off her abs. Vikki is aiming to become a fitness model but doesn't want to be 'that woman who looks different in the magazines or wants to be a size 6' VIKKI'S DIET BEFORE Lunch Cheesy pasta then chocolate and crisps Dinner Ready meals WEIGHT 17 stone 5 lbs ...AND HER DIET NOW Breakfast Egg bagel or Weetabix with a banana Lunch Chicken wrap Dinner Chicken, rice and vegetables Exercise Five-six gym sessions a week WEIGHT 13 stone 7 lbs 'There were pictures that the girls were taking at makeup school while I was working, as well as group shots at the makeup school,' Vikki recalled. 'I hated the way I looked in pictures. 'I wanted to change my lifestyle after seeing pictures of myself and being unhappy every time I looked in the mirror.' In January 2016 she joined her local Xercsie4Less gym, which she says felt like 'another world', and gave her diet a drastic overhaul, ditching her cheesy pasta and chocolate for lean meat, rice and vegetables. 'I binged on chocolate, I was a chocoholic,' said Vikki. 'I still have a few cheat days where I have a few tablespoons of Nutella to fulfill a craving.'
