(Glenn Payette/CBC)\nThe complainant, 22, did not know Snelgrove's name, Strickland said, and the RNC began an investigation after the woman told another police officer what had happened.\nThe Ontario Provincial Police were called in by the RNC after a complaint was filed in the spring of 2015.\nSnelgrove, 39, a 10-year veteran of the RNC was charged in July 2015, and suspended without pay.\nRNC officer accused of sexual assault heading to trial Preliminary inquiry concludes for RNC officer accused of sexual assault A six-man, six-woman jury is hearing evidence in a trial that is slated to run for the rest of the week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:34:09.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
