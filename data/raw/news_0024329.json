Photo: Jessica Shapiro \nA bad credit score can reduce a consumer's ability to borrow from banks, mortgage companies, and other credit providers. \nCredit scores sit between zero to 1200, and the national average is 757. \nAn \"excellent\" VedaScore is between 833 to 1200, \"very good\" is between 726 to 832, \"good\" is between 622 to 725, \"average\" is between 510 to 621 and \"below average\" is 509 or less. \nDavid regularly checks his credit score and credit report and was disappointed to see his credit worthiness status had dropped from \"excellent\" to \"very good\". \n\"They said they're not going to look at this again, so I'm not sure what I can do,\" he said. \nFairfax Media is aware of one person who expected her credit score to have increased. Instead, it had dropped by 20 points. \nAlexandra Kelly from the Financial Rights Legal Centre said the changes were further evidence the scoring system was \"completely opaque\". \n\"It's not a good indicator of anything as there is no reliability as to the methodology of the scoring due to the lack of transparency,\" she said. \n\"For most consumers it would feel completely arbitrary and completely outside of their control making it almost useless as any real indicator.\" \nMs Kelly said few credit providers had started reporting repayment history, for example, and those that are may not be doing so consistently. \n\"There will be greater capacity for errors simply because of the increase in the amount and regularity of information able to be reported,\" she said. \n\"Issues around how financial hardship will be dealt with under the new regime are still the subject of debate and we are concerned that consumers may be detrimentally affected.\" \nIn December, the Australian Privacy Commissioner found Veda had breached privacy rules when it sold commercial products to consumers who simply wanted a copy of their credit report, which, by law, they're able to access for free once a year. \nConsumers should obtain a copy of their report each year to make sure all the information is correct.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:42:05.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
