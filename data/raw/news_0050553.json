Trading DMC was an absolute no brainer! There has been a dark cloud over this franchise for years! That cloud is now gone! â Grant Napear (@GrantNapearshow) February 20, 2017 The Kings were never going to win with Cousins. NEVER! This was a no brainer! I wish him well! I really do but it was time! â Grant Napear (@GrantNapearshow) February 20, 2017 The Sacramento Kings just became a team again! Its time to move into the future! It's time to start winning! This gives them the best chance â Grant Napear (@GrantNapearshow) February 20, 2017 24,22,28,28,29,33 and 24 this season. That's the # of wins with Cousins! It was time to move into another direction! Period! â Grant Napear (@GrantNapearshow) February 20, 2017 And here's maybe the most important thing. Most of Cousin's teammates the past 7 years hated playing with him! That is a fact! â Grant Napear (@GrantNapearshow) February 20, 2017 \nTell us how you really feel, Grant.
