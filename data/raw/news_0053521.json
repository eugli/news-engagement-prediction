Not only did the great man claim an 18th grand-slam title in Australia, beating his nemesis Rafael Nadal in the final , but on Tuesday his home tournament in Basel announced his participation for the next three seasons. \nFederer’s new deal with the Swiss Indoors will take him up to the age of 38. This might not have been unusual in the days of wooden rackets, or even the early graphite models. Jimmy Connors was still entering ATP events at 43. But in the modern era, when Andy Roddick pulled the plug at 30, Federer will count as a tennis-playing Methusalah. \nWhat a turnaround this has been from early January, when Federer eased himself back into action at the Hopman Cup in Perth after a six-month lay-off, and most observers started speculating about a rapid fall down the rankings. \nEven after the Australian Open victory, which has carried Federer back up from No. 17 in the world to No. 9, his acceptance speech prompted further concerns that he might emulate Pete Sampras – who retired immediately after his surprise win at the 2002 US Open – by leaving the game on a high.

Even the men who run the ATP tour must have felt alarmed, given the scale of devotion that Federer commands. \nBut the next morning, as he paraded the trophy at Melbourne’s Royal Exhibition Building, Federer clarified that “I hope to be back next year, of course.” Federer dismissed talk of retirement after his Australian Open win Credit: Rex Features \nT hat’s why I took the six months off, to hopefully still be playing for a couple of years.” Or more, judging by today’s announcement. \nIt is unlikely – but not completely out of the question – that if Federer maintains his fitness for another three or four years, he might be able to challenge Connors’s long-standing ATP records. \nUntil Federer came along, Connors had a massive lead of almost 200 wins over second-placed Ivan Lendl (by 1256 to 1068). Now Federer has overtaken Lendl and stands on 1087. As for titles, he has 89 to Lendl’s 94 and Connors’s 109. The most decorated players in Open-era tennis \nI t would take an Indian summer of Navratilova-esque proportions for Federer to challenge those records. But he could be the beneficiary of some favourable conditions. Tournament directors around the world must be considering speeding up their courts after the Australian Open, where the slick surfaces favoured the old-time skills of Federer and Nadal over the new breed of athletic youngsters, and viewing figures soared in response. \nAs that golden fortnight proved, it is never wise to write Roger Federer off.
