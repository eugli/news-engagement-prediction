By Sara Boboltz \nYou may have heard that something wonderfully unexpected happened at the Oscars last night. \nBest Picture presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway pulled one more Bonnie-and-Clyde stunt (this time by accident) when Beatty procured an envelope and Dunaway announced that “La La Land” had won the night’s top honor . But there had been an envelope mix-up. “Moonlight” had truly won the prize, so producers quickly sprung into action, jumping onstage to let everyone from “La La Land” know about the error. \nLearning the news, Ryan Gosling , who plays the jazz-obsessed Sebastian in the dreamy musical, reacted appropriately: Ryan Gosling reacts as the true winner of best picture \"Moonlight\" is announced at the #Oscars . pic.twitter.com/QBRso3yHNJ — AP Images (@AP_Images) February 27, 2017 \nGosling’s co-star Emma Stone, who plays wannabe-actress Mia, could also be seen onstage mouthing “oh my god,” before turning away from the camera with a slight smile. ABC \nBackstage, Stone recalled her mixed emotions in the moment while heaping praise onto the night’s real Best Picture winner. \n“I fucking love ‘Moonlight.’ God, I love ‘Moonlight’ so much!” she enthused . “And, of course, it was an amazing thing to hear ‘La La Land.’ I think we all would have loved to win Best Picture.” \n“But we are so excited for ‘Moonlight.’ I think it is one of the best films of all time.” \nAs for “La La Land” director Damien Chazelle, who had won earlier in the night for Best Director, the revelation was a truly shocking one ― at least in the moment he was caught on camera. when u realize everyone sees through u pic.twitter.com/utndsfcofS — E.
