Are they friends of yours?\" \nTrump just asked a black journalist if she was \"friends\" with the Congressional Black Caucus and wanted to set up a mtg for him w/ the CBC. pic.twitter.com/whnDJLI8MI — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) February 16, 2017 \nTaken aback by the implication, April responded, \"No, no, no, no — I'm just a reporter.\" \n\n\n\nTwitter erupted in both anger and shame as they lambasted the prez for not knowing what the CBC is, assuming all black people know each other, and treating a White House correspondent like his personal secretary. \n\nCheck out Twitter’s best responses to the foolishness below. \nHey @realDonaldTrump : @AprilDRyan is a honest & professional reporter. She's not your secretary. @Reince knows @RepRichmond 's number. Use it — Gwen Moore (@RepGwenMoore) February 16, 2017 . @realDonaldTrump : @AprilDRyan is a journalist.
