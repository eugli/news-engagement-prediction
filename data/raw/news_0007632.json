Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDoctor Who star Peter Capaldi wants a woman to replace him – saying Rising Damp’s Frances de la Tour should play the Time Lord. \nFrances – Rigsby’s love interest in the 70s sitcom – would finally break the show’s male dominance of 12 male leads. \nSpeaking after the Mirror revealed he was leaving the show, Peter said: “The time felt right to bow out, to let somebody else play this wonderful role and I would like Frances de la Tour to be first female doctor.” \nBut show insiders say incoming boss Chris Chibnall is eyeing Andrew Buchan as the 13th Time Lord, having worked with him over the past five years. \nBuchan, 37, is best known for playing Mark Latimer, the father of murdered schoolboy Danny in Chibnall’s hit ITV series Broadchurch , which returns for its final run later this month.

Whishaw, 36, is a hugely popular choice thanks to his success as Q in the recent Bond films while Tovey, 35, also has a strong fan base thanks to his role alongside Aidan Turner in supernatural drama Being Human. \nBookies were offering 8/1 against any female landing the part. \nJames Norton was 9/1, Ben Whishaw and Lara Pulver 10/1, Richard Ayoade 11/1, Russell Tovey 12/1, Vicky McClure 20/1 and Donald Trump, 2000/1. How the Daily Mirror reported Peter's shock news What does the future hold? \nDoctor Who’s popularity has waned in recent years, with some feeling Capaldi lacked the dynamism of predecessors Matt Smith and David Tennant. \nAnd writer Steven Moffat was blasted for his “over-complicated” plots. BBC chiefs are now seeking a clean sweep for Chris Chibnall’s first run in 2018. \nOne source revealed: “The BBC management would love a return to the format of the show in Tennant’s time.” Video Loading  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:39:52.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
