Hayes pointed out that as bad as the status quo was a year ago, there were ways it could get worse, like, say, the head of Exxon becoming the Secretary of State. \nFox talked about the failures of the Democratic party to fully excite the progressive base, particularly on the issue of fracking. \nHayes shot back that the voters ended up choosing the person who wants to “frack the entire country,” and asked them, “Can you look me in the eyes, both of you, and say, ‘Yes, 24 days into the Trump administration, this is about what I expected it to be’?” \nSarandon shot back, “What is the point of even saying that?” \nShe confronted Hayes about whether he’s adequately covered big issues people care about, and Hayes shot back that of course certain things get more coverage than others. He told Sarandon she could be focusing on other issues too, but she doesn’t because she’s choosing her battles. \nThe interview ended with Sarandon saying the one positive thing about Trump winning is that people are finally “awake” and participating. \nWatch above, via MSNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:11:15.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
