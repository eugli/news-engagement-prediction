Nnia Nwodo \nHe said that if the FG gives the pro-Biafran agitators the needed attention, the agitation would be laid to rest. He urged the FG to have a rethink to resolve the issue, even as he called the MASSOB and IPOB for cooperation. \nNwodo said,”I extend my hand to the MASSOB and IPOB members to work with us. I understand your frustrations, your plights and impatience. Inspite of the reproach they have used to oppress you, you have remained calm. \n“Come home, your father has listening ears. I feel bad about how our youths are treated. I know of the Boko Haram terrorising the North-Eastern part of the country. They conquered and displaced community authorities and hoisted their flag, invariably announcing their own country but I have not heard of any of them that was arrested. \n“I know of the Niger Delta Avengers who are angry as the MASSOB and IPOB and are destroying oil facilities. I don’t know any of them that has been arrested. What has IPOB done to be treated differently? \n“The fact that we have not joined them means that they have not received our cheers because we still believe that the FG can still handle the situation. I call on the Federal Government to have a rethink on how they handle the issues of IPOB and MASSOB. If they treat them as they have treated others, they will have a rethink.” \nNwodo appealed to the Igbo to be united, noting that the region has been long neglected. \nHe said capital projects are not duly given to the states of the South-East and South-South and urged the FG to give the regions fiscal freedom \n“I am appealing to all Igbo to be united. I feel that dissipating our strength will not help any of us.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:17:12.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
