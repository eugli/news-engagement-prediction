Paul LePage’s criticism of the franchise. \nThe mayors of Portland, Bangor and Brewer sent a letter to Patriots owner Robert Kraft asking for the trophy to make appearances commemorating the team’s Super Bowl win. \nThe mayors say arenas in Portland and Bangor, which is next to Brewer, could host the events. \nLePage has used a pair of recent radio appearances to express his displeasure with the Patriots. He is critical of the team for backing out of a move to the state of Connecticut in the late 1990s. \nBangor Mayor Joe Baldacci says Maine has a “proud tradition” of supporting the Pats.
