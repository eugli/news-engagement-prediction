Woodward \nThere are few episodes of the original Star Trek series as memorable as “Mirror, Mirror,” which introduced the concept of a parallel Mirror Universe where up is down, heroes are villains, and Spock has a goatee. Over the years, the Mirror Universe would pop up now and then in subsequent Star Trek shows like Deep Space Nine and Enterprise , but it was never referenced in perhaps the most famous Star Trek sequel series, The Next Generation . That changes with the upcoming IDW comic Star Trek, The Next Generation: Broken Mirror , which finally introduces the Mirror Universe version of Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the rest of The Next Generation crew. \nThe six-issue miniseries, written by Scott and David Tipton and illustrated by J.K. Woodward, focuses on Mirror Picard’s efforts to secure the ISS Enterprise and return glory to the bloodthirsty Terran Empire. Although he’s still interested in cerebral pursuits like chess, this Picard is clearly much more muscle-bound and intimidating than his counterpart, and his crew is similarly threatening and relentless. \nThere will be a Free Comic Book Day prelude introducing the series, and then the first issue will officially hit stores sometime in May. Check out a preview of what the series will look like below. J.K.
