Rodman have released a joint statement condemning the recent order by President Trump. “It is both unconstitutional and deeply wrong to say that you cannot enter our country because of where you were born or what religion you were born into,” the WGAE and WGAW said, applauding the federal court’s stay on deporting people being held at US airports to their countries. \nThe two guilds are also perturbed over reports that Asghar Farhadi, the 44-year-old Iranian director of the acclaimed 2016 film “The Salesman” -- nominated for an Oscar in the Best Foreign Language Film category -- may be prevented from attending the awards ceremony later this year.

Our guilds are unions of storytellers who have always welcomed those from other nations of varying beliefs who wish to share their creativity with US. We are grateful to them, we stand with them, and we will fight for them,” the guilds’ joint statement added. \nNational Award winning lyricist-writer Swanand Kirkire and SWA executive member slammed Trump’s move saying: “It’s time that those who don’t believe in hate politics come together and speak now. Until we do that, the politicians will keep playing with the fate of the humanity.” \nRenowned film writer Anjum Rajabali said the divisive positions and hate propaganda that Trump resorted to during his election campaign are now delivering on those shocking promises. \n“While it is shocking, it isn’t surprising. Unless voices of protest are heard loudly and repeatedly, each time such moves are made, our freedoms will shrink until they disappear,” Rajabali warned. \nFollow @htshowbiz for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T10:31:23.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
