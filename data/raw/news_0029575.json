The burglary at the Hijra Welfare Association office came to light around 12.30 pm when the four custodians -Jyothi Naik alias Sabera Bakshi, Sakira Bakshi, Rita Bakshi and Pallavi Bakshi -returned to the office-cum-residence for lunch and found the cupboard and almirahs ransacked. The custodians, who are addressed as 'Choudhurys', informed the Shahinayatgunj police. \n\nThe association acts as an informal bank for over an informal bank for over 1,500 members of the community in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.It has been functioning from the same place for the past 400 years and owns the building. It has given out 10 flats and a few shops in the building on rent.

They use the association office like a bank to store their savings,\" police said. The criminals left one almirah untouched. \n\nPolice said the CCTVs in the area have recorded three men boarding an auto with bags after committing the burglary .
