Trump also talked about his own popularity, the sources said.\nWhen White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked about the conversation during the briefing today he said, 'The president's conversation with President Putin is a private call between the two of them and I'm going to leave it at that.'\n'We put a readout out on the call and we have nothing beyond that,' Spicer said.\nBut later Thursday, Spicer disputed the Reuters report, claiming Trump was in fact familiar with the treaty but was asking his team for an 'opinion' on the subject.\n'It wasn't like he didn't know what was being said,' Spicer told a group of reporters.\n'He wanted an opinion on something, which is â€¦ very different.'\nSpicer also said that the White House is growing increasingly concerned with 'leaks' of President Trump's calls with foreign leaders.\n'Some of them are done in a way that the release of that information is clearly a breach of a lot of protocols and laws,' Spicer added.\nThe Reuters report was based on the account of two U.S. officials and one former U.S. official with knowledge of the call.\nScroll down for video\nU.S. officials told Reuters that President Donald Trump (left) trashed a nuclear arms treaty when he was on the phone with Russian leader Vladimir Putin (right)\nIt referred Reuters to the official White House account issued after the Jan. 28 call, which did not mention the discussion about New START.\nIt has not been previously reported that Trump had conveyed his doubt about New START to Putin in the hour-long call.\nNew START gives both countries until February 2018 to reduce their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550, the lowest level in decades. It also limits deployed land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers.\nDuring a debate in the 2016 presidential election, Trump said Russia had 'outsmarted' the United States with the treaty, which he called 'START-Up.' He asserted incorrectly then that it had allowed Russia to continue to produce nuclear warheads while the United States could not.\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said he supported the treaty during his Senate confirmation hearings.\nDuring the hearings Tillerson said it was important for the United States to 'stay engaged with Russia, hold them accountable to commitments made under the New START and also ensure our accountability as well.'\nTwo of the people who described the conversation were briefed by current administration officials who read detailed notes taken during the call.\nOne of the two was shown portions of the notes. A third source was also briefed on the call.\nReuters has not reviewed the notes taken of the call, which are classified.\nThe Kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe phone call with Putin has added to concerns that Trump is not adequately prepared for discussions with foreign leaders.\nTypically, before a telephone call with a foreign leader, a president receives a written in-depth briefing paper drafted by National Security Council staff after consultations with the relevant agencies, including the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies, two former senior officials said.\nJust before the call, the president also usually receives an oral 'pre-briefing' from his national security adviser and top subject-matter aide, they said.\nTrump did not receive a briefing from Russia experts with the NSC and intelligence agencies before the Putin call, two of the sources said.\nReuters was unable to determine if Trump received a briefing from his national security adviser Michael Flynn.\nIn the phone call, the Russian leader raised the possibility of reviving talks on a range of disputes and suggested extending New START, the sources said.\nNew START can be extended for another five years, beyond 2021, by mutual agreement.\nUnless they agree to do that or negotiate new cuts, the world's two biggest nuclear powers would be freed from the treaty's limits, potentially setting the stage for a new arms race.\nNew START was ratified by the U.S. Senate in December 2010 by a vote of 71 to 26.\nThirteen Republican senators joined all of the Senate's Democrats in voting for the treaty, although Republican opponents derided it as naive.\nThe call with Putin was one of several with foreign leaders where Trump has turned to denounce deals negotiated by previous administrations on trade, acceptance of refugees and arms control.\nIn a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Trump questioned an agreement reached by the Obama administration to accept 1,250 refugees now being held by Australia in offshore detention centers.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-09T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:39:23.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
