Even his boss Jay Z is calling for the project’s release , but Jay E claims he will deliver the album when he’s completely satisfied with the material, not when others tell him to.\nRelated Jay Electronica Tells Us 'Nobody In The World Wants a Jay Electronica Album Out' More Than He Does Watch Jay Z Tell Jay Electronica: 'Let's Put This Album Out' Ab-Soul Explains Jay Electronica 'Diss' on 'Do What Thou Wilt' “When it’s ready, when it’s ready. It don’t matter if Donald Trump say, ‘Put the album out,’” he told Billboard in a new interview , adding he’s constantly questioned about the drop. “[...] But I guess the question you asked me is what will it take. When it’s finished. When it’s something that I’m pleased with because regardless of the six billion people on planet Earth, even if I put something out and the whole six billion say it’s absolutely beautiful and I don’t feel okay with it, I’m the one that carries that. I have to be at a place where I’m pleased with the offering. So, it will come—it’s coming soon.”\nThe New Orleans rapper insists he’s moving “slowly but surely” towards the project’s completion; however, he is somewhat put off by the idea of a traditional album.\n“Then again, an album is a false concept anyway. An album is something that was created by corporations as a product to make money,” he said . “People have been making music, doing plays, and telling stories around fires for trillions of years. I like albums but I’m not too really handcuffed to the concept of that.”\nIn August 2016, director Jason Goldwatch posted an image of Jay E with a caption that read “1.7.17,” leading many people to believe that was the release date for the long-awaited project. Jan. 17 has come and gone, and we’re still waiting on a release date for Act II: Patents of Nobility . \nTags: News , Jay Electronica , Jay Z , Roc Nation , Albums", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:18:22.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
