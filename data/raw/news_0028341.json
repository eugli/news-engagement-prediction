'She will climb right up beside him and let him get all over her.'\nWeezy's tongue hangs out because most of her teeth had to be pulled out\n'She is still timid, especially with strangers, and very quiet,' Mavro tells The Dodo. 'Literally, a dying fly once kicked her out of her own cage.'\nWeezy also hides in blankets like a little child.\nIn addition to her fear issues, Weezy's teeth were in bad shape when she was adopted and all but two had to be removed. So her tongue will often hang out of her mouth uncontrollably.\n'She is still timid, especially with strangers, and very quiet,' Mavro said. 'Literally, a dying fly once kicked her out of her own cage.'\nWeezy looks a little uncomfortable as she's treated to a bath by her owners\nOne of Weezy's favorite pastimes is to hide in a blanket\nThings began to change though seven months ago, when Mavro brought home her newborn baby boy Evan.\nWeezy has never been nervous around Evan and lets the baby cuddle her as much as he wants.\n'He is seven months old now and she loves him even more than she loves us I think,' Mavro says.
