Thank you for your understanding.” \nIt was not clear who will perform in her absence. Radiohead and Kendrick Lamar will also headline the two-weekend festival in Indio, California. Radiohead will perform on April 14 and 21, and Lamar on April 16 and 23. \nBeyonce was originally set to perform April 15 and 22. It would have marked her first time she performed at the festival, and she would have been the first female act to headline Coachella since Bjork in 2007. \nBeyonce, who last appeared at Coachella in 2014 when she danced onstage during her sister Solange’s set, announced last month that she and Jay Z are expecting twins. It is not clear when Beyonce is due to give birth. Earlier this month, the pregnant singer performed at the Grammy Awards, where she won two honors for her genre-bending album, “Lemonade.” \nJay Z, 47, and Beyonce, 35, are the parents of Blue Ivy, who was born in 2012. \nOther performers at this year’s Coachella include Lorde, the xx, Bon Iver, Future, Gucci Mane, Justice, DJ Snake, DJ Khaled and Father John Misty. \n(Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
