The company sought the expertise of nurses working in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) and neonatal therapists to create a product that promotes growth while protecting premature babies’ fragile skin. \n“The diaper features gentle, specially-sized fasteners and a narrow, absorbent pad to provide a flexible fit so that baby can be comfortably positioned in a fetal tuck, with arms and legs close to the body,” the company said in a press release . “The soft, smooth liner and gentle leg gathers offer leakage protection without irritating fragile, underdeveloped skin.” Huggies The Nano Preemie Diaper is the latest in Huggies line of diapers designed for newborns in the NICU \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , about 10 percent of babies born in the U.S. in 2015 were born preterm. The rate of preterm births decreased from 2007 to 2014, but the CDC found the rate slightly increased from 2014 to 2015. Preterm birth is defined as a baby born before 37 full weeks of pregnancy. According to the World Health Organization , the United States is listed as number six on the list of countries with the greatest number of preterm births.
