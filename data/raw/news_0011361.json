I'm guilty of keeping mine well past their expiration date, and my sleep has almost definitely suffered as a result. \nSleep experts agree that while the right pillow alleviates pressure and prevents many forms of joint pain, back pain, and headaches and, thus, is crucial for a great night’s sleep, a bad pillow leads to bad sleep, which plays a role in causing everything from mood disorders to weight gain to dull skin. \nThe average lifespan of a pillow is only about 18 to 24 months. If yours are looking saggy, deflated, lumpy, or all of the above, it may be time for replacements. And for replacements, I can't recommend Brooklinen's pillows enough . \nI have nothing but positive things to say about Brooklinen's sheets . They've yet to be dethroned as my favorite all-around value and I recently bought my brother the move-in bundle , which sets you up with everything you need to turn your mattress into a fully functioning and comforting bed, as a housewarming gift. So I figured I might as well give the company's pillows a try, too, since mine were looking and feeling worse for wear. \nI'm not the only customer who's had this thought; the company told me about 30% of people who buy sheets from it come back for pillows. \nBefore choosing my pillows, I spoke with Brooklinen's cofounder, Vicki Fulop, to find out which of the company's options would serve me best: \n\"In general, our firm pillow is best for back sleepers, the plush is ideal for stomach sleepers, and the mid-plush is perfect for side sleepers,\" Fulop told me. \"However, the reality is that most people don't sleep in the same position the whole night but rather rotate and move around. For this reason, the mid-plush pillow is the best all-around option and our best-seller of the three options due to its versatility.\" \nI also had to choose between down and down-alternative . \"The main difference between down and synthetic pillows is that down is made from natural fibers (feathers and down), while synthetic pillows are filled with down-alternative fibers (poly-blends),\" Fulop said. \"Synthetic pillows are usually made to mimic the feel of down and are great for people who are allergic to down.\" \nBrooklinen \nI don't have any allergies, but I move around a lot in my sleep and generally gravitate toward the softer end of the spectrum when it comes to pillows, so I ended up trying out Brooklinen's plush and mid-plush down pillows. After five months of testing, I liked both of them a lot, but the mid-plush was my favorite. Like Fulop said, the mid-plush is super versatile, supportive, and great for people like me who don't exclusively sleep on their back, side, or stomach. It's a little bit of everything, in a good way. \nIn fact, I'm pretty sure it's improved my sleep a bit. I'm a light sleeper, but I've been sleeping through the night a lot more frequently over the past few months. Part of that might have to do with the temperature of the pillow. I sleep hot and tend to overheat, but Fulop told me the natural fibers in Brooklinen's down pillows are made to be more breathable and sleep slightly cooler. The pillows I'd used previously were synthetic, and those retain a bit more heat. \nAt $69 apiece for two mid-plush down pillows and $89 apiece for two plush ones, I paid $316 to outfit my queen-size bed. That may seem like a lot upfront — and it is when you don't have a ton of disposal income to your name — but it's important to keep in mind your cost per use for essential home items like these. Over 18 months, that initial $316 comes out to about $0.60 per use. That's not bad. Over 24 months, if I'm lucky, that's about $0.44 per use, which is even better. \nBrooklinen \nDon't simply take my word for it, though. \n\"I hesitated with the price, but after reviewing other down pillows, I decided that a good night's sleep was well worth it,\" one commenter wrote. \"We love these pillows, and after my sister used one as a guest, she is ordering the exact same one. Treat yourself.\" \n\"Definitely has the a factor. Very happy with it and cannot wait to order my second pillow,\" another said. \nOne more commenter summed it up by simply saying, \"Most comfortable pillow I have ever slept on.\" \nA few people complained about a strange, chemical-like smell that aired out of the pillows a few days after receiving them. I didn't come across this issue in my testing, but it's something that seems fairly common among new pillows , not just Brooklinen's. If you're not completely happy with your pillows, though, the company offers free return shipping in the US and exchanges for the first 60 days after your get your order. \nBrooklinen \nI highly recommend giving Brooklinen's pillows a try if your pillows have seen better days. Your sleep affects virtually every aspect of your life, and good-quality pillows can go a long way toward improving it. \nThe pillows are available in plush, mid-plush, and firm for standard and king sizes. You can also choose between down or down-alternative. My suggestion is to determine which type of sleeper you are (back, side, stomach, or a bit of everything) and choose what's right for you from there. \nBrooklinen's down pillows go for $69 to $119 depending on the size and density you choose, while the down-alternative ones go for $59 to $79.
