That includes the income that businesses like retailers and restaurants get from increased spending by Delta employees, and the effects of that income in turn being spent locally, and so on.\nThe profit sharing to be paid to Delta employees Feb. 14 supports nearly 4,000 jobs outside of Delta, according to Humphreys.\nOver the past five years, Delta has paid out nearly $5 billion in profit sharing.\nDelta employees are also getting a 6 percent raise in base pay in April.", "external_links": ["http://www.myajc.com/business/update-delta-reports-billion-profit-for-2016-but-quarterly-profit-declines-percent/dxIKkiC1EKmLoMFxLfKEPL/"], "published": "2017-02-14T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:49:36.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
