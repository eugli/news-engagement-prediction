At present, there are 27.31 crore accounts . \nThe withdrawal of currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs1,000 in November had led to an acute shortage of cash. Though the cash supply is near-normal, there are many daily wage earners who are still outside the banking net. \nThe Centre, meanwhile, has underlined the need to adopt electronic payment modes or cheques to pay wages. \n“There is need to encourage electronic or cheque payments for daily wage labourers and others...we need to move to an environment where usage of cash is limited,” Das added. While the banks will undertake the exercise to open more bank accounts, lakhs of the existing ones are under the scanner of the tax department. Many Jan Dhan accounts have been used by surrogate account holders to convert black money into white. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T15:44:25.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
