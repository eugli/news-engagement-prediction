Even the dancers should have stopped dancing and helped me off the f--king stage. I'm sorry.\" \nIt's been more than two months since Mariah started off 2017 on a bum note thanks to her appearance on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve With Ryan Seacrest . \nAfter her performance in Times Square didn't exactly receive rave reviews, accusations flew as to why this performance wasn't her best. Photos \nStars Celebrate New Year's Eve 2016 James Devaney/WireImage \nUltimately, the Mariah's World star is trying her best to move past it, even if some people will never understand the situation. \n\"I don't even want to bring this up too much, but whatever, we're obviously talking about it, the New Year's Eve situation–that couldn't be helped,\" she shared. \"It's just something where if I can't explain it to the entire world, then they're not going to understand it, because it's not what they do. Just like I wouldn't understand somebody who had a desk job and how to do that. I couldn't.\" \nWith a new boyfriend by the name of Bryan Tanaka and an upcoming tour with Lionel Richie , Mariah has much to look forward to. She also is focused on co-parenting her twins with ex Nick Cannon . \nRecently, the comedian faced a tabloid report claiming he suffered a nervous breakdown and that his erratic behavior has family members concerned. Ultimately, the TV host set the record straight on social media. \n\"If you report these lies, expect a slander and defamation lawsuit,\" Nick shared with his Instagram followers. \"Look everyone, see how the media is trying to break a King? It's all good though, I'm a warrior! I was built for this! Me and my family, my mindset, and my spirit are all stronger than ever.\" \nHe added, \"I felt like releasing this so called ‘journalist' info to the public so you all can get at them, but instead I release nothing but positive energy into the Universe.\" TAGS/ Mariah Carey , New Year's Eve , Music , Concerts , Top Stories Additional Privacy Statement Your information may be shared with other NBCUniversal businesses and used to better tailor our services and advertising to you.
