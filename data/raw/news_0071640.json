Even though Samsung initially planned to introduce the flagship one week earlier in South Korea, sources claim the company has decided otherwise.A high-profile official for a carrier said that the release of the Galaxy S8 in South Korea has changed from April 14 to April 21 due to reasons such as the size of supplies and others. Although Galaxy S8's market release has already been set for April 21, Samsung has yet to decide on the pre-sale schedule. Three Korean carriers have been in talks with Samsung concerning the pre-order period of the Galaxy S8, but the handset maker wants to wait and observe the market's feedback towards the LG G6. Speaking of which, LG G6 will go official on February 26 , but the smartphone won't be available for purchase until March 10.
