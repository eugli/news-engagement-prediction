Showing your face is part of our way of life,\" she said in a party conference speech in December 2016. \n\"Our laws take precedence over honour codes, tribal customs and sharia.\" Her call for a burqa ban was met with thunderous applause. Bavarian Interior minister Joachim Herrmann Daniel Karmann/AFP \nBavaria is the first German state to have taken steps towards implementing the ban. On 21 February a draft law was introduced to ban the full-face veil in public institutions. \n\"Covering up your face will be banned in areas of public service, in high schools, schools, kindergartens, in areas relating to general security and during voting,\" a government statement read. \nBavarian area-state officials hope to \"quickly and legally\" incorporate the ban into state legislation. \nBavarian interior minister Joachim Herrmann said Muslim women who cover their faces are \"breaking the local culture of communication.\" \n\"A communicative exchange takes place not only through speech, but also through eye contact, facial expressions and gestures. This is the basis of our interaction with one another and the foundation of our society and our free democratic order,\" Herrmann said. \nThe state in southeast Germany proposed the controversial bill after two terror attacks took place in July 2016 .
