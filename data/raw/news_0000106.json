Woodson and other prominent African Americans. Since 1976, every U.S. president has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month. Other countries around the world, including Canada and the United Kingdom, also devote a month to celebrating black history. \nAnd now, Beyoncé’s made her mark. \nLet’s face it: This isn’t just any ole celebrity pregnancy announcement — this is BLACK HISTORY. Congratulations to Jay Z and Beyoncé! May you continue to be the world’s collective #FamilyGoals.
