SUPPLIED \nJean Batten (Kate Elliott) waves to the crowd in the one-off Kiwi drama Jean. \nNow that investment has paid off, with Jean selected by the New York Festivals Grand Jury as a finalist in nine categories: Best Direction, Best Screenplay, Best Actress, Best Camerawork, Best Original Music, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, Best TV Movie and Best Drama Special. \nREAD MORE: * Thames extras help Jean Batten tele-movie come to life \n\"I think that's a record for one production,\" says Jean producer Paula Boock. \"It's pretty special, and since we have no New Zealand television awards anymore, these international competitions really help in getting recognition for excellence and overseas sales for our productions.\" SUPPLIED \nCelebrated New Zealand aviator Jean Batten with Buddy the cat, who was her flying companion in 1934. \nNZ On Air head of communications Allanah Kalafatelis was equally thrilled at the news. \n\"Obviously we're delighted, because it's always a reinforcement of the quality of New Zealand drama when it gets recognised overseas.\" \nWith regard to NZ On Air's investment in Jean , Kalafatelis said the international recognition was \"fantastic,\" labelling it \"the proof in the pudding\". SUPPLIED \nKate Elliott has received a best actress nomination for her performance as Jean Batten in Jean. \nLast year's winners at the New York Festivals International Television and Film Awards include Westside , which brought home a gold world medal, and Rachel Hunter's Tour Of Beauty , Gloriavale and Te Mana O Te Moana - The Pacific Voyagers , all of which won silver world medals. \nDirected by Robert Sarkies ( Scarfies , Out Of The Blue ) and starring Kate Elliott ( Shortland Street, Bliss ) as Jean Batten, Jean screened on TVNZ 1 last October.
