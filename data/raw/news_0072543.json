He was taken home and has been referred to Youth Aid, van de Wetering said. \n\"A fair bit of the stolen clothing from the shop was found inside the recovered vehicle.\" \nVan de Wetering said it was \"disturbing\" that a 12-year-old was involved. \n\"It makes you wonder what the average age [of the rest of the group] is.\" \nCCTV footage from the Stirling Sports showed a dark-coloured Mazda Demio was also involved. \nThat car was then used in the armed robbery of the Te Kowhai Food Centre on Monday. \nSenior Sergeant Dean Anderson said four people wearing hoodies and stockings over their faces stormed the dairy about 11am. \nTwo were armed with a handgun and golf club. \n\"A handgun was pointed at the store attendant,\" Anderson said. \nThe two men working in the store at the time instinctively fled out the back door, he said. \n\"They were uninjured but pretty shaken.\" \nAnderson said the foursome took some items to a waiting Mazda Demio, which was later found dumped on the side of Cemetery Rd in Whatawhata. \nHe could not comment on whether the weapons had been found. \nIt was highly probable it was the same group that had ram raided the clothing store the night before, he said. \nPolice were making inquiries to track the other offenders down. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:17:43.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
