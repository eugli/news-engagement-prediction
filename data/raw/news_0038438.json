The Iowa Hawkeyes are set to announce two new hires to their coaching staff. A press release could come as soon as this afternoon according to sources.\nTim Polasek , formerly the offensive coordinator at North Dakota State, will be Iowa’s new offensive line coach, and Kelton Copeland , formerly of Northern Illinois, will be the Hawkeyes’ new wide receivers coach in 2017.\nOriginally from Iola, Wisconsin, Polasek has been the offensive coordinator and running backs coach at North Dakota State since 2014. Prior to that, he was at Northern Illinois, where he coached tight ends and fullbacks in 2013, and had a previous stint as NDSU, rising from grad assistant to running backs coach and special teams coordinator from 2006-2012.\nPolasek, 37, played collegiately at Concordia University in Wisconsin, setting several QB records and graduating as the all-time leading passer. He graduated from Concordia in 2002 with a bachelor’s degree in physical education and earned a master’s degree from Wisconsin-Stevens Point in 2005.\nPolasek and his wife, Jill, were married in 2014.\nCopeland, a Miami native, has been at Northern Illinois since 2013 and has coached wide receivers, running backs, and special teams during his tenure. Previous coaching stops include South Dakota, Coffeyville Community College, Northwood, and Emporia State, which is also where he played collegiately as a quarterback from 1999-2002.\nCopeland, 36, graduated with a bachelor's degree from Emporia State in 2003. Copeland and his wife, Bridgette, have three daughters, Marlea, Devyn, and Kabryn.\nIowa now has filled out their coaching staff with nine full-time assistants. If the NCAA approves a 10th assistant in April, as expect, there will be one more opening at that time.\nIowa Coaching Staff:\nKirk Ferentz - Head Coach\nBrian Ferentz - Offensive Coordinator/Running Backs (promotion)\nPhil Parker - Defensive Coordinator/Defensive Backs\nKen O'Keefe - Quarterbacks (new hire)\nTim Polasek - Offensive Line (new hire)\nKelton Copeland - Wide Receivers (new hire)\nLeVar Woods - Tight Ends\nReese Morgan - Defensive Line\nKelvin Bell - Recruiting Coordinator/Assistant Defensive Line\nSeth Wallace - Linebackers\nEdit", "external_links": ["http://www.niuhuskies.com/coaches.aspx?rc=131", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/jtqm9lsrnechtt2ud2qw)", "http://www.gobison.com/staff.aspx?staff=192", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/jtqm9lsrnechtt2ud2qw"], "published": "2017-02-14T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T19:47:27.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
