Strapping into gear \nIt looks like Ryan Blaney's flight suit is a bit more extensive than his firesuit. Harness in \nIt isn't quite a HANS device, but it should do a fine job protecting Blaney and Jones in their flight with the Thunderbirds. Visors down \nQuite the intimidating look for Erik Jones in his pilot suit and helmet. Looks like it could use a 5-hour Energy logo somewhere, though. Buckle up, baby! \nWithout the visors, these helmets look like something a 1940s NFL player would wear. Top Gun \nRyan Blaney looks as focused as Maverick from Top Gun for his upcoming flight. Learning the basics \nHow about a little pre-flight driver's meeting to talk about the rules and regulations. Not sure how the stages break down for this flight. \nBriefing time \nMaking sure that Blaney and Jones know that they're about to go 700 miles per hour, upside down in a F-16 fighter jet. Meet your pilots \n\"We're going to go extremely fast, extremely high, and do a lot of flips\", said the pilots. \n\"Cool,\" the drivers responded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:51:22.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
