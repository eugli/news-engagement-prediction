Michael Chow/azcentral.com \n\nWell, it appears some semblance of sanity -- a microscopic shred, at least -- remains at the state Capitol.\nOur leaders are balking at a plan to provide a(nother) $225 million subsidy to the Arizona Coyotes.\nIt seems Republican Sen. Debbie Lesko – when she’s not contemplating how to siphon ever larger amounts of public money into private schools – has reservations about another publicly funded arena far, far from her home district in Peoria.\nROBERTS: A $225 million subsidy for the Coyotes? Really? \nGOP Sen. John Kavanagh – when he’s not plotting ways to stop people from protesting via threats of arrest and seizure of assets – is also not too keen on the idea.\nMeanwhile, Senate President Steve Yarbrough -- evidently seeing no way to get a piece of pie as he does with tax credits for private schools – has “serious reservations”.\n\"You are using taxpayers' money to prefund a significant private enterprise,\" Yarbrough told The Republic’s Craig Harris. \"And those don't always turn out so well.\"\nOK, so I’ll just skip right over the jokes about using taxpayer’s money to fund private enterprise and get right to the point.\nIt's 'not easy' because it's dumb A bill to provide $225 million in public funding for yet another hockey arena is in trouble. But is it dead?   (Photo: file) \nThe lack of support from Lesko, Kavanagh and Yarbrough should be enough to kill the Coyotes’ plan, given that 16 of the Senate’s 17 Republican votes likely will be needed. Democrats have long been more interested in funding schools than in funding professional playgrounds.\nStill, Senate Bill 1149’s sponsor, Sen. Bob Worsley, isn’t throwing in the towel.\n\"We are still working on it. It's not easy,\" he told Harris.\nPerhaps the reason it isn’t easy, senator, is because it’s a dumb idea to commit future public funds to building another hockey arena when you can’t properly fund public schools.\nAnd because it’s not wise to pit other cities against Glendale, whose taxpayers are still on the hook for $145 million for the Coyotes’ current 13-year-old hockey arena.\nYes, yes, we know. Glendale rescinded that deal so it’s Glendale’s own fault it’s about to be the proud owner of a Gila River White Elephant. It’s what happens when politicians’ heads are filled with promises of future sports glory on their own apparently innocuous home turf, if only they pony up massive amounts of public cash to make it so.\nThey're not giving up (no wonder) Well, look how that turned out? With a deal that was terrible for taxpayers. By the time Glendale’s residents are thoroughly squeezed for that horrendous mistake, they will have dumped a half a billion dollars into keeping an NHL team in town.\nCuriously, despite evidence of doom in the state Senate, Coyotes Chief Executive Anthony LeBlanc isn’t giving up his tin cup.\n“There are a lot of moving parts in this legislative process and everything is malleable and open for discussion until the very end,” he told Harris. “We will continue to educate lawmakers about a complex project that creates a true public-private partnership and offers the Coyotes an economically viable solution to remain in the Valley for the long term.\"\nHmm. Might one of those moving parts have to do with the Coyotes’ lobbyist, Jim Norton of Axiom Public Affairs? Jim Norton, who just coincidentally is still pals with his former fraternity brother from ASU?\nYeah, a guy named Doug Ducey.\nEyes wide open, Arizona.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn A timeline of the Arizona Coyotes in Glendale   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Here's a brief overview of the team's history since making Gila River Arena its home.  David Kadlubowski/The Republic/azc Fullscreen 2001 | The city enters agreement with Ellman Cos., chaired by then-Coyotes' owner Steve Ellman. Glendale borrows $180 million to build Jobing.com Arena and Ellman builds Westgate, which the city plans to depend on to pay off arena debt payments each year.  The Republic Fullscreen 2003 | The team plays its first game at Jobing.com Arena.  Emmanuel Lozano/The Republic Fullscreen 2006 | Westgate opens, two years behind schedule. Ellman sells the Coyotes to Jerry Moyes, a Valley trucking magnate.  The Republic Fullscreen 2009 | Moyes files the Coyotes into bankruptcy. The NHL takes over leadership of the team.

It was expected to be a boost for Westgate.  David Wallace/The Republic/azc Fullscreen Summer 2013 | Glendale enters agreement with IceArizona. The city pays $15 million a year in exchange for shared arena revenue and to keep the Phoenix Coyotes anchored for at least five years.

This deal marks the first federally recognized tribal naming-rights deal for a sports venue with a major professional sports league in the U.S.  Nick Oza/The Republic/azc Fullscreen Summer 2014 | The team changed its name to the Arizona Coyotes, per terms of the deal with Glendale, for the beginning of the 2014-15 season.  Arizona Coyotes Fullscreen December 31, 2014 | IceArizona sold a 51 percent stake in the franchise to Andrew Barroway in a $152.5 million deal. Barroway joined the existing nine-member ownership group and became the team's chairman and governor. Co-owner Anthony LeBlanc remained the team's president and CEO.  Tom Tingle/The Republic Fullscreen Buy Photo June 10, 2015 | In an emergency special meeting, the Glendale City Council voted, 5-2, to terminate its 15-year agreement with IceArizona for the Coyotes to manage and play at Gila River Arena. Council documents cited a state conflict-of-interest law.  David Kadlubowski/The Republic, David Kadlubowski/The Republic/azc Fullscreen June 12, 2015 | The Arizona Coyotes filed a lawsuit against Glendale, and a Maricopa County Superior Court judge granted the team's request for a temporary injunction to keep the city from voiding the team's arena deal.  David Kadlubowski/The Republic, David Kadlubowski/The Republic Fullscreen Buy Photo June 12, 2015 | Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Dawn Bergin granted the team's request for a temporary injunction to keep Glendale from killing their arena deal.  Nick Oza/The Republic/azc Fullscreen June 2015 | The Coyotes reshuffled their ownership group, a move that demoted Andrew Barroway from his majority role less than six months after he purchased a controlling interest in the club. Barroway -- who had taken on a largely behind-the-scenes role with the team as he continued to be based on the East Coast while being the managing partner of an event-driven hedge fund -- remained the largest shareholder and Governor of the Arizona Coyotes.  Michael Schennum/The Republic Fullscreen Buy Photo July 24, 2015 | The Glendale City Council unanimously approved a two-year deal. Under the new deal, the management fee Glendale pays the team was reduced from $15 million to $6.5 million annually, Tindal and Frisoni cannot be employed by the team, the city can change arena managers, and it does not collect any ticket surcharges or parking-fees revenue.  Mark Henle/The Republic/azc Fullscreen September 2015 | Glendale hired Beacon Sports Capital Partners LLC as a consultant to seek bidders to manage the Gila River Arena, with the manager taking over as early as July 2016. IceArizona has overseen the arena the past two years.  The Republic Fullscreen December 2015 | Arizona Cardinals President Michael Bidwill and Coyotes President Anthony LeBlanc each told The Republic in separate interviews that their teams will not bid to manage Gila River Arena. LeBlanc said he's uncertain whether the Coyotes even have a long-term future at the Glendale arena, and team officials are exploring the possibilities of a new arena somewhere in metropolitan Phoenix.  The Republic Fullscreen Buy Photo Feb. 3, 2016 | Glendale selected facilities-management company AEG Facilities to operate Gila River Arena. City officials must work out a contract with the company's executives to present to the City Council for approval, and determine if there's a way to keep the Coyotes at the arena. City officials said AEG -- which owns, operates or consults with more than 120 venues worldwide, including the Staples Center -- puts Glendale in the best position to retain the Coyotes, bolster business at the adjacent Westgate Entertainment District and attract top events to the arena.  Tom Tingle/The Republic/azc Fullscreen April 5, 2016 | AEG top executives promised to bring a steady stream of top acts to Gila River Arena during a briefing at a Glendale City Council meeting, but declined to say whether the Arizona Coyotes will be a long-term attraction. Executives said they prefer the Coyotes stay at the arena, but Coyotes President Anthony LeBlanc has stated that the team is exploring moving to a new, yet-to-be built arena somewhere in metro Phoenix. Details of such a proposal have yet to be disclosed.  Handout/Jason Douglas McEachern Fullscreen November 14, 2016 | The Coyotes announced a plan with Arizona State University to build a joint 2-arena facility with Sun Devils Hockey in ASU's Athletic Facilities District in Tempe. The deal, which was far from finalized, depends on the state passing legislation to create a special taxing district to fund the facility.  Michael Chow/The Republic Fullscreen February 3, 2017 | ASU announced it will not move forward on the deal to bring the Coyotes to Tempe. The announcement followed quick opposition to a bill introduced at the state legislature that would create a funding mechanism for a new arena. The bill's sponsor said an amended version of the bill will move forward.  Arizona Coyotes Fullscreen Like this topic?
