Of course, Yeezy was going through some pretty serious personal problems at the time, but the comments still cut deep — and now Drake is responding. \nRelated: Jennifer Lopez Says She Has So Much 'Love' For Drake \nHere's what the former Degrassi star had to say about Yeezy: \n\"I think everybody has their own little things going on, I'm not really sure what he's referring to half the time, as in the same breath, I went from being … like working on a project with him, to him sort of publicly shitting on me and DJ Khaled for being on the radio too much. But yeah I'm not really sure, everybody's got their own thing going on. Again me when I hear that, I just distance myself from it. You know, alright if that's what it is I don't really even understand the point you're trying to make but whatever it is that you're going through, I accept it, I don't respect it at all.\" \nAnd it sounds like Drake took 'Ye's targeting pretty personally, too (below): \n\"I feel like me and Khaled are just good people, I'm not sure why we're the target of your choice that you made that night.\" \nWow!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:14:47.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
