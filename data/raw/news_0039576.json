Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA teenage mother who secretly gave birth to a baby and then threw the premature newborn out of a window sent text messages to her boyfriend and wrote a chilling Facebook post. \nThe baby, weighing 2lbs, died in the fall from a second-storey flat and her 16-year-old mother, Antonia Lopez, has now admitted to causing the child's death. \nShe sent text messages and a Snapchat photo to her boyfriend, telling him she was having painful contractions and then announcing that she had given birth to a girl. \nBut the girl \"panicked\" and threw the baby out of a bedroom window before telling her mum about what she had done. Police tape surrounds the apartment block where the baby died (Photo: KMTV Action 3 News/Youtube) \nLopez, from Omaha in the US state of Nebraska, went into labour and gave birth at home in the early morning hours of September 30 last year.

It hurts so much.\" \nFive minutes later she told him she was in \"so much pain\" and then a minute later said she wanted it to \"stop\". \nShortly after 2.20am she wrote: \"It was a girl by the way.\" \nLopez, who had been pregnant for about seven months, later asked for help to hide the baby , which was about 14in long. \nShe wrote on Facebook: \"Who can do me a huge favor and has a car?\" The teen sent text messages to her boyfriend (Photo: KMTV Action 3 News/Youtube) \nHer distraught mother found the baby and called 911 shortly after 4am to report the incident. The baby was pronounced dead upon arrival at hospital. \nLopez claimed in a police interview that she didn't know she was pregnant - a claim disputed by her boyfriend - and she thought she was having her period. \nThe teen told detectives she saw a sac emerge from her vagina and pierced it with a nail clipper, and then saw the baby's feet, the Omaha World-Herald reports. \nHer boyfriend told police that he had urged her to tell her mother about the pregnancy and visit a doctor, but she refused. \nLopez, who was charged with felony child abuse, entered a plea of admission after her case was moved to juvenile court.

It was more of a panicked reaction.\" \nLopez is due to be sentenced on March 24. She will get probation or be sent to a group home or a juvenile detention centre.
