Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAfter receiving rave reviews for her performance in London’s West End, it's a huge coup for the Manchester theatre scene that Sheridan Smith decided to reprise her role in a new run of Funny Girl - and how lucky we are that she did. \nSmith is jaw-droppingly fantastic as the wonderfully awkward and bumbling Fanny Brice. She had the entire audience in stitches from the moment she took the stage and carried it through for the whole performance. \nWhen she wasn’t creating hilariously funny routines, or using her humour to lighten an awkward moment, she transformed into a passionate, soul-bearing vocalist who made the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. \nThe show is set in the early 1900s and is semi-biographical, based on the life of Broadway star and comedienne Fanny Brice (Smith), whose rise to fame as a comedy actress and singer brought turmoil to her relationship with the wildly charming but dishonest husband Nick Arnstein, played by Chris Peluso. \nIt features one of the most recognisable Broadway scores of all time, with songs like ‘Don’t Rain on My Parade’ and ‘People’, and swings between Fanny’s quick thinking comedy routines and her heartbreak.

But there is no doubt Smith has made the role her own and I have a feeling this audience will be boasting about seeing Smith as Fanny Brice at the Palace Theatre in Manchester for many years to come. \nFunny Girl will now tour 22 cities across the UK, with Smith sharing the lead role with her London understudy Natasha J Barnes. It will remain at Manchester’s Palace Theatre until Saturday, February 25, and Smith is expected to return to the Palace for the tour finale in August.
