Cowboys still figuring out their backup QB situation Josh McCown in, Tony Romo cut? Cowboys still figuring out their backup QB situation Pinay Hotties 1 hour ago NFL Sports Leave a comment 0 Views \nThe Dallas Cowboys can’t trade quarterback Tony Romo until March 9, when the league year starts, but they might not have a trade partner anyway. \nThe Dallas Morning News reported the Cowboys are expected to release Romo, “likely within the next two weeks.” That is in line with a report a few weeks ago from ESPN’s Ed Werder that said people close to Romo expected he would be released, not traded . \nTony Romo could be cut within the next two weeks, according to a report. (AP) \nIf the Cowboys had hopes of still trading Romo, it’s doubtful you’d see multiple reports that he’s expected to be cut. Anything can happen in the next couple weeks, but it doesn’t seem there are any teams too interested in trading for Romo. That makes some sense when you realize there’s no obvious landing spot for Romo. The Denver Broncos have said repeatedly they like their young duo of Paxton Lynch and Trevor Siemian, the Houston Texans have to pay Brock Osweiler $18 million this season, and no other team checks the box of being a contender and needing a quarterback. Romo will obviously find a starting job somewhere, but it’s still apparently difficult for the Cowboys to find anyone willing to trade for him. \nCowboys owner Jerry Jones said last weekend that no decision has been made on Romo , though it’s hard to imagine Romo being back with the Cowboys. That means the Cowboys will need to find a backup for starter Dak Prescott, and Josh McCown’s name has emerged. The Dallas Morning News said McCown, who is from Texas, “would welcome a homecoming” and the Cowboys have shown interest. McCown was cut by the Cleveland Browns so he’s free to sign with anyone immediately, though he’s evaluating his options. McCown will be 38 next season but has been a reliable backup for most of his career, so it seems to be a good for for the Cowboys. \nFirst the Cowboys need to figure out what to do with Romo. If Romo is let go at some point over the next two weeks, one of the most interesting stories of the offseason will get really hot. \n\nFrank Schwab is the editor of Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports.
