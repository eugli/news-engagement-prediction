(Photo: REUTERS) (Photo: jimmykimmel/Instagram) \nJimmy earnestly encouraged everyone watching to reach out to someone during this divided time in the political climate, before explaining that he was ready to \"bury the hatchet\" with someone he has \"had issues with\" - Matt. \n\"I've known Matt for a long time,\" he said. \"When I first met Matt, I was the fat one.\" \nThe host then took a jab at Damon for giving Casey Affleck his Oscar-nominated role in Manchester by the Sea and making \"a Chinese pony tail movie instead,\" in reference to The Great Wall.
