The experience is enough to make the mellowest of individuals into a ranting mess. Wilson is so big, faceless and impossible to get sense from, that I was working up a theory it might be a Government Department. \nBut Mum's demanding change. Her case goes something like this: Ad Feedback \nShe was parked in a Wilson car park. Being a rule-keeper, she had paid for her parking and displayed the ticket on her dashboard. Due to the hot day, the ticket curled up in the sun and fell on the floor. This meant the poor sod that Wilson's underpays – the guy who must have one of the least-fun jobs out there – couldn't see the ticket. He whacked her with a $65 fine. \nAt this point in her story I interrupted and suggested that if she'd just used my trick of parking on the footpath with your hazard lights on, she could have avoided the whole situation. \nShe was having none of it. She understood the situation and wanted to contact Wilson's to make it right. And thus began the great My Mum Vs Wilson Parking War of 2017. \n\"They're only open from 10am-3pm,\" she cried. \"And they don't even have an office in Christchurch where I can go to explain the situation.\" \nSo she talks to another faceless person in another city about the same thing she just explained to the last person… \n\"I already sent a photo.\" \nAnd Wilson's obscures and loses emails and generally does anything in its power to make it tough for the person questioning the bill. \n\"I give in.\" \nThe next thing, there's been a fine whacked on the fine for not paying the fee and Mum's back on the blower, trying to make sense out of the same nonsense which previously drove her up the wall. \nNow as I mentioned, my mother's a reasonable woman, a reasonable woman getting less reasonable by the minute, but a reasonable woman nonetheless. \nBut now she's got a bee in her bonnet. \n\"What about vulnerable people?\" She cries. \"I'm calling Gary McCormick.\" \n\"What about those that can't speak English properly and so just pay the fine without realising they don't have to.\" \n\"What about people in wheelchairs?\" \n\"It's nothing to do with people in wheelchairs,\" I suggest. \n\"Maybe not this time,\" she says. \"But that's a different battle or another day. How are they expected to get about in those dangerous pot-holed lots that Wilson's calls its place of business?\" \nLook over your shoulder Wilson's – my mum's coming. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:23:32.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
