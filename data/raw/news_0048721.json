(Ricardo Ramirez Buxeda) \nWhile Democrats have responded to the mass shootings by proposing more restrictions, including a ban on assault-style rifles and large capacity ammunition clips, they have virtually no chance of passing while Republicans dominate both legislative chambers. \nDemocratic Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith of Orlando, whose bill would ban assault-like rifles, said expanding areas where guns can be carried isn't the right approach. \"Their solution is, 'We want guns everywhere, all the time, by every person,' which is not going to address these problems. It's going to make them worse,\" he said. \nPICTURE GALLERY: The city of Orlando Tuesday released 400 crime scene photos taken in the aftermath of the Pulse nightclub shooting in June. None of the images depict the people killed or wounded in the club. They do, however, show the holes officers made in the exterior walls. \nRepublican Rep. Jake Raburn of Valrico said many of this year's Republican proposals were easily approved in the House last year and will likely pass the chamber again this year. And he sees a better chance that the Senate will pass gun-right expansions, especially since the chamber's top advocate, Sen. Greg Steube, chairs the Judiciary Committee — the first stop for gun legislation. \nRaburn is sponsoring the bill to allow guns at airports, an issue he proposed before the Fort Lauderdale shooting. He said hypothetical arguments against the idea just don't hold weight, such as police not knowing which person holding a gun is an active shooter and which is a permit holder defending himself. \n\"Florida is one of only six states that doesn't already allow that,\" he said. \"We haven't seen any of these 'what if?' scenarios of law abiding permit holders being a problem in airports.\" \nThe following is a look at gun-related legislation that has been filed by Republicans and Democrats \n___ \nBills filed by Republicans would: \n— Allow licensed handgun owners to openly carry their weapons. \n— Allow concealed weapons permit holders to carry a gun in non-secure areas of airports. \n— Allow concealed weapons permit holders to carry guns at any legislative meeting or committee meeting. \n— Allow concealed weapons permit holders to carry guns on state university campuses. \n— Allow concealed weapons permit holders to carry guns at county and municipal government meetings. \n— Allow concealed weapons permit holders to carry guns at career centers. \n— Allow members of the state Cabinet who have concealed weapons permits to carry guns anywhere not prohibited by federal law. Reduce the penalty the violating the current open carry ban from a second degree misdemeanor punishable by up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine to a non-criminal civil fine of $25. \n— Holds business owners who ban guns from their property liable for injuries suffered by a concealed weapon permit holder who is attacked \n— Allows concealed weapons permit holders to bring guns to courthouses and temporarily surrender them to security. The courts must keep the weapons in locked storage space. \n— Expand the \"stand your ground\" to give more protection to people using the self-defense claim by placing the burden of proof on prosecutors to prove people charged with assaulting or killing someone else wasn't acting in self-defense. \n— Place on the November ballot a measure asking voters to exempt law enforcement officers from the 72-hour waiting period to buy personal handguns. \n___ \nBills filed by Democrats would: \n— Ban semi-automatic assault-type rifles like AR-15s and AK-47 and detachable ammunition magazines that hold more than 7 rounds. \n— Bans guns at performance arts centers and theaters. \n— Removes exceptions to a law requiring guns in homes occupied by minors be stored in locked boxes or with trigger locks. \n— Increases the penalties for displaying concealed weapons in a threatening manner on or near school properties or activities from a third degree felony to a second degree felony. Increases penalties for people who fail to store a gun in a way to prevent access by minors.
