Rosella, whose creations have been worn by the likes of Katy Perry and Nicole Scherzinger, called \"the world's first graphene dress\" a new step for the fashion industry. The futuristic LBD is on show at the intu Trafford Center, a shopping and leisure complex in Manchester, and is set to tour museums around the UK. Leveraging the 'wonder material's' properties Graphene was first discovered in 2002 by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, physics professors at the University of Manchester. It won a Nobel Prize in 2010 and is known as a wonder material that's one atom thick. It's everything from lightweight and conductive to flexible and thermal. \"There's a lot of potential for graphene within the textile industry,\" Paul Wiper, a research associate at the National Graphene Institute who worked with Rosella, told CNN. Photos: Incredible innovations: These materials could change the world Graphene-gyroid – Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have designed a new material that is 10 times stronger than steel. Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: Incredible innovations: These materials could change the world Graphene-gyroid – The MIT researchers discovered that fusing small flakes of graphene -- widely regarded as the world's strongest known material -- into a gyroid-shaped structure creates a new material that is unusually light but still distinctly strong. Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Incredible innovations: These materials could change the world Graphene-gyroid – One of the researchers on the project, Zhao Qin, says he thinks that the graphene-gyroid material could one day be widely used in engineering and architecture.

Research suggests that transparent wood may one day be used as a substitute to glass.

Hide Caption 10 of 10 That's down to the material's versatility, according to Wiper. For instance, graphene can be made into a solution or powder that can be dispersed onto or combined with different materials to create a graphene composite that conducts electricity.

Wiper said that in the future, researchers could add a special graphene coating to clothes to improve their resistance to fire. Graphene-enhanced smog masks that shield the wearer from pollutants are another possibility.
