Screengrabbed from Hasbro website The results of the latest Monopoly online votes are in—and it looks like the classic thimble token will be replaced by the hashtag sign. Last month, the creators of the iconic board game, Hasbro, launched the Monopoly Token Madness Vote, to determine which of the original eight emblems would be replaced by new designs. READ: Hasbro sets up online vote for new Monopoly tokens ADVERTISEMENT As per the USA Today, tokens Scottie the dog, top hat, car, boot, wheelbarrow, battleship and the cat all made the cut. However, the sewing-friendly thimble—which has been around since 1935—will not be brought back for the next version of the board game set to be released sometime in August. “We were a little bit surprised that the thimble got among the lowest votes because it’s been in the game for so long,” Jonathan Berkowitz, senior vice president of marketing for Hasbro Gaming, said, according to the USA Today report. The online contest, which started on Jan. 10 and ended Jan. 31, had voters choose from 64 possible designs—including 56 fresh options and the eight original pieces. Given the hashtag sign’s popularity on social media these days, Hasbro officials were expecting it to be the favorite among internet voters. Berkowitz also said “there is a possibility other classic pieces were also voted out,” as Hasbro won’t reveal the rest of the final tally until the World Monopoly Day on March 19. Even if it lost the popular vote, the Hasbro exec is not closing the door on the thimble’s potential return to the game in future expansions. “We never say absolutely forever,” Berkowitz said. The recent online poll is not the first time Hasbro used crowd sourcing to engage its loyal fan base, as unanimous votes had the iron token replaced by the cat token in 2013. “We’re always listening to our fan base,” Berkowitz said regarding the company’s engagement. “They’re very engaged with the brand, especially on Facebook. We want them to continue to weigh in with ideas.” Khristian Ibarrola", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:24:52.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
