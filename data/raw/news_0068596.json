However the infrared transmitter and receiver touted for the iPhone 8 would be significantly more sophisticated.\nThe latest speculation follows rumours that Apple may move away from its Touch ID fingerprint scanner in favour of iris or facial recognition technology. This week it was announced that Apple bought Israeli facial recognition technology start-up RealFace.\nIris or facial scans could be a defining security feature of the new iPhone and could be used to bolster the security of Apple Pay — provided people are happy to scan their face every time they make a purchase.\nApple has stayed characteristically tight-lipped and has refused to comment on the reports.\nBut the immense buzz around the iPhone 8 has led market analysts to warn that expectations around the iPhone 8 may be too high , as Apple’s share price climbs on the back of the optimism.\nThe company is expected to unveil three phones in September. Two nearly identical phones with screens of different sizes, and one super premium phone that is pegged to cost about $1500.\niPhone 8 latest leaks 0:50 The iPhone 7 was just released but now Apple have already moved on to ideas for the iPhone 8.
