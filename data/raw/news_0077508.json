Venkaiah Naidu. (ANI) Union Information and Broadcasting Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday asked US to condemn the killing of Indian techie Srinivas Kuchibhotla and take strongest action to prevent such attacks.\nMeeting reporters after consoling family members of Kuchibhotla here, he said India had taken up the issue with the US at the highest level and stressed the need to take steps to provide security and assurance to Indians living there.\nVoicing concern over series of incidents of alleged racial discrimination, Naidu said it was the responsibility of the US government and the civil society to put an end to this.\nTerming the Kansas shooting in which Kuchibhotla was killed and his colleague Alok Madasani was injured, as shameful, he said this was blot on US which claims to be the oldest democracy.\n“American President and people should come out openly and condemn such actions and then take strongest action and send a message that this is not acceptable,” Naidu said.\nYou may also like to watch this video :\nStating that seven incidents of this nature occured, the Minister said that they are sending wrong message which was not good for US, its people and the world.\nNaidu said that when small incidents occur in India, it was blown out of proportion and the country which claims to be the oldest democracy tell the world that this is what happening in India.\nThe Minister said the US should answer the questions raised by Srinivas’ wife so eloquently even in this hour of grief.\nHe said the incident had caused anguish to Indians and brought sorrow to Telugus.\nHe said External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj acted swiftly and directed the Indian embassy to make arrangements for bringing home the slain techie’s body.\nNaidu, who was accompanied by Union Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya, said while the series of incidents caused concern among the Indian community in the US, there was no need for panic.\nHe said it was not proper to take decisions like dropping plans to travel to the US or returning to India.\n“There is elected government and democratic system there. Elected public representatives there are voicing concern on such incidents,” he added.\nKuchibhotla, 32, was killed and Alok Madasani was injured when Adam W. Purinton, a white man who earlier served in the US Navy, shot them at the Austins Bar & Grill in Olathe, Kansas state, on Wednesday night.\nPurinton reportedly got into an argument with the victims and hurled racial slurs. He yelled “get out of my country”, “terrorist” before shooting them.\nKuchibhotla of Hyderabad and his colleague Madasani from Warangal district in Telangana were working as aviation programme managers at Garmin, an MNC.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/52J_jrJHauk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent"], "published": "2017-02-27T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:02:28.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
