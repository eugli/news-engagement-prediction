When he returned to his vehicle at about 11:45pm on Tuesday, he discovered it had been broken into and everything inside taken. \nThompson said he probably had \"thirty G's worth of stuff\" in the van. \nREAD MORE: * Tourists targeted in knifepoint robbery in Nelson \n\"I had a lot of lenses, a few camera bodies and high-end outdoor equipment - and my laptop too.\" \nAlso among the estimated 75kg worth of possessions taken was Thompson's clothing and camping gear, which included an $800 sleeping bag which he called his \"baby\". \nIn the early hours of Wednesday morning he noticed someone had updated his status on Facebook. The posts appeared to be trying to set him up. Thompson said the messages implied he had given his possessions away in exchange for sex. \nOne post in Thompson's name said he was \"so silly i got so wasted an gave all my stuff to her, now i regret it.[sic]\" \nAnother: \"Amphetamine. it is a dangerous thing. it takes me to experience it myself to realise what control it has on you! life goes on [sic].\" \nThompson also saw messages that he hadn't written, sent from his profile to someone he didn't know. \nHe had never met the woman posting on Facebook. \nThe strange messages also caused alarm among his friends and family at home. \n\"They were making these crazy posts and I was getting texts from overseas saying: 'what the hell's gotten into you,'?\" he said. \nHe printed out screenshots from his Facebook profile and showed them to Nelson police. \nThompson thought the alleged thieves were stupid to post on his Facebook page. \n\"I don't know what she was thinking.\" \nGlenn Russell, 43, and Ngakita Tamou, 21 appeared in Nelson District Court charged with stealing items worth $30,000 from Thompson on February 14. Russell has been remanded in custody until his next court appearance on February 17 and Tamou was remanded on bail until March 7. \nWhile Thompson had some of his gear returned by police, much of it was still missing and he remained hopeful it could be recovered. \nUntil just a few days ago Rutherford Park was a designated freedom camping site in Nelson and would normally have been full of tourist vehicles. \nHowever, with campers moved on, Thompson's van was \"pretty much alone\", which by his own admission would have made it an easy target for thieves. \nWhile the car was parked in the open, he said his possessions were hidden away in backpacks under the seats. \nThompson said he had been living in the vehicle while he was trying to sell it. While trying to stay positive despite his situation, he was unsure what his next move would be. \n\"I'll have to go back to the States at some point , but I'm kind of questioning what is the point of anything – like, what are you going to take away from me now, cos' I have nothing else?\" he said. \n\"You can only try and live in one pair of pants for so long.\" \nWhile he had some travel insurance Thompson said it did not extend to covering his stolen equipment. \n\"Everyone says: 'Oh, this is Nelson and its so nice and no-one gets robbed' – I've lived in some hard parts of the United States and I've never had my car broken into, so it kind of puts a bitter taste in your mouth,\" he said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:51:49.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
