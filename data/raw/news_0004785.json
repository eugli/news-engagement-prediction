The 'cycle' belongs to him. The relationship is intact, father-son relationship can never change. It was necessary to distance ourselves from people who ultimately wanted to harm the Samajwadi Party ,\" he said referring to the bitter infighting in the Yadav clan. \n\n\"This is not an act of rebellion... Netaji (Mulayam) is above all of us in the party. The responsibility to take Samajwadi Party forward if now with the next generation,\" he said. \n\nAsked if Mulayam will campaign for the alliance, he said, \"Our only aim is to retain power in the state. His (Netaji) blessings are with us. Netaji will be the most happy person if SP wins. I am sure, the SP's thumping victory will only increase Netaji's respect.\" \n\n\"His (Netaji) photographs are in our campaign. Netaji is in our each slogan. Netaji told me that he will campaign for the alliance,\" he said.
