Since then, the company has arranged 16,000 patient house call visits, and created more than $5.9 million in savings, the company claims. \nThat figure is derived from reduced non-emergency trips to ER and urgent care facilities and a 50% reduction in unnecessary prescription antibiotic usage, among the company’s network of doctors and patients. \nOn the heels of its latest financing round in October , Heal has brought on some heavy technology hitters to round out its executive team. That includes Rish Tandon, the former general manager of mobile apps at Amazon who will serve as the Chief Technology Officer, and Bhavini Soneji, the former director of engineering at Snap, who will be head of engineering. \n\n“I joined Heal to create purposeful innovation that will make the Heal experience even more proactive, precise and powerful,” said Bhavini Sonjei, in a statement. “Together with Rish, we are eager to re-invent the system of healthcare as we know it.” \nHeal is working on becoming far more than simply an on-demand service for doctor visits. According to investor Jim Breyer, the founder of Breyer Capital, and former managing partner of Accel Partners, Heal’s roadmap includes significant investment in applied artificial intelligence to improve patient outcomes and drive down costs. \nPlans are in place for Heal to begin working with portfolio company Kensho on ways to apply that company’s technology in the healthcare space. \nAdditional investors in Heal include Thomas Tull, the founder of Legendary Entertainment; Lionel Ritchie, Jeb Bush, David Ellison, and Paul Davis. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:15:46.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
