We've got you covered.\" That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. \nWhen an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link. \nUSA TODAY uses tools to keep readers informed and engaged at all hours of the day.
