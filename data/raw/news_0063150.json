South Carolina and Virginia want federal aid to deepen ports, among other projects. \nIn a letter to Trump, Republican Governor Henry McMaster said South Carolina also needed help replacing roads and bridges. “An appropriation of $5 billion from your infrastructure plan will help us bridge this economic gap,” he wrote. \nPattison said governors wanted a “toolbox” of financing options, including municipal bonds, cash, public-private partnerships and federal matching funds. \nThe governors are scheduled to meet with Trump on Sunday evening and again on Monday morning. \nOne of the speakers at the governors’ conference, Leo Hindery, a managing partner at New York’s InterMedia Partners, will tell state executives that creating a federal infrastructure bank is the only way to fund the hundreds of billions of dollars needed for public works. \nThe United States has long been criticized for its lagging public works spending. The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded U.S. infrastructure at D+ and estimated the country needs to invest $3.6 trillion by 2020. \nDuring his campaign, Trump said he wanted action on infrastructure in his first 100 days as president. That now seems unlikely. He also talked about creating a tax credit to encourage private sector investment. \nTrump’s plans to create an infrastructure council have yet to get started. Republican lawmakers have said they expect to get White House infrastructure proposals but have given no details or timing. \n(Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and James Dalgleish) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T21:17:00.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
