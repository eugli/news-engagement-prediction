Mrs. May, after Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union , was eager to cement good relations with the new American president and arranged a rapid visit to Washington. During the visit, she conveyed the invitation, which Mr. Trump accepted. During the debate, a Labour legislator, David Lammy, spoke of Mr. Trump’s attitudes and asked why Britain should “abandon all its principles” and invite him, “because this country is so desperate for a trade deal that we would throw all our own history out the window?” He added: “We didn’t do this for Kennedy. We didn’t do this for Truman. We didn’t do this for Reagan. But for this man, after seven days, we say, ‘Please come and we will lay on everything because we are so desperate for your company?’” He added, “I am ashamed that it has come to this.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But a Conservative, James Cartlidge, said that if Britain canceled the visit, “there will be smiles all round in the Kremlin,” which wants to “divide the West.” And Simon Burns, a Conservative, said that it was important to be “a candid friend” able to influence Mr. Trump and the United States, particularly so given Britain’s plan to leave the European Union . Various opinion polls indicate that a small majority of Britons support the state visit. Mr. Trump would hardly be the first contentious leader to be so honored; the queen, acting as always on the recommendation of the government, has in the past received President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and recently President Xi Jinping of China, after which she was caught on camera speaking of how “very rude” the Chinese had been. “A queen who has been asked over the decades to host tyrants such as Presidents Mobutu of Zaire and Ceausescu of Romania is going to take a brash billionaire from New York effortlessly in her stride,” William Hague, a former foreign secretary, wrote in T he Daily Telegraph . There is also concern that a Trump visit would be met with large protests, comparable to 2003, when President George W. Bush made a state visit and many came out to protest the Iraq War. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has supported the petition to disinvite Mr. Trump because of the president’s “ban on people from seven Muslim-majorities countries” and his decision to block refugees from entering the United States. “In those circumstances, we shouldn’t be rolling out the red carpet,” Mr. Khan said on Sunday. On Monday, the House of Lords began at least two days of debate on a bill, already passed by the House of Commons, to authorize the government to enact Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which would inform the European Union of Britain’s intention to leave the bloc after voters chose to do so in the June referendum. The government intends to invoke Article 50 by the end of March, if not sooner, beginning at least two years of negotiations with the other 27 member states on the terms of Britain’s exit and a framework for future relations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:00:55.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
