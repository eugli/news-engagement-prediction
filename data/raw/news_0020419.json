Save Reuters/Andrew Kelly \nA report by NBC News cites unnamed US intelligence sources claiming that Russian officials are deliberating a handover of Edward Snowden as a \"gift\" to the Trump administration. Since leaking information on the NSA's \"PRISM\" surveillance, the former government contractor has been living in Russia since 2013 on a permit and is a year away from being able to apply for citizenship . He still faces federal charges, and previously, Donald Trump has called Snowden a \"traitor,\" and a \"spy who should be executed. \nSnowden himself tweeted out the NBC report, along with a claim that it represents \"irrefutable evidence that I never cooperated with Russian intel. No country trades away spies, as the rest would fear they're next.\" Finally: irrefutable evidence that I never cooperated with Russian intel.
