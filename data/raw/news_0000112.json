In a video reposted by DJ Akademiks on Tuesday (January 31), Thug briefly and vaguely addressed a few topics: haters, his sexuality and his cash flow. \n“Hi, I’m just checkin’ in right now. It is I, Jeffery. The one that gets the most hate, and they say gay, but is also the richest in the A.” A video posted by DJ Akademiks (@akadmiks) on Jan 31, 2017 at 10:33am PST \nThere’s no doubt that compared to us mere mortals, Young Thug is worth a fortune — but there are some Atlanta veterans who most likely outstrip him on that front. \nFor example, Ludacris earned $10 million in 2016 alone , thanks in large part to his role in the latest Fast And Furious film — and that’s without getting into the fact that his albums have gone platinum 12 times. \nLuda appeared on Forbes’ Hip Hop Cash Kings list last year, while Young Thug has yet to get Forbes’ attention.

Every album they’ve released has gone at least platinum, with Speakerboxxx/The Love Below being one of the very few Hip Hop albums to hit the esteemed diamond certification rank (that’s 10 million units sold). \nOf course, these cats have all been established in the game for longer than Thug — but that doesn’t change the fact that they’re all probably richer than he is. \nThat said, Thugger’s name is buzzing heavily right now, thanks in part to the multiple successful projects he released in 2016, his modeling contract with Calvin Klein and his current supporting role on Drake’s European tour . \nWe’ll have to keep an eye on this year’s Cash Kings list to see if Thug claims his throne as the “richest in the A.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T20:45:53.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
