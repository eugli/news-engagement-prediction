Sutton's 'Roly Poly Goalie' tucks in to a pie during Arsenal cup tie \nWith Shaw's Sutton contract due to expire at the end of the season host Piers Morgan asked: \"What would it take to prise you and your pies out of Sutton to Arsenal?\" \nGesturing at a plate of four pasties on the studio sofa, Shaw responded: \"I think two more than the four you've got there.\" \nSusannah Reid then tells her co-host to up his bid before Morgan adds: \"So let me just clarify, for six Cornish pasties you will sign for Arsenal.\" \n\"Definitely,\" declares a chuckling Shaw.
