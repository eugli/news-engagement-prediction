A class-action lawsuit is now accepting claims after Sony, NEC, Panasonic, and Hitachi-LG were accused of inflating the prices of optical drives sold to PC makers like Dell and HP. If you bought a PC with a DVD drive between April 1st 2003 and December 31st 2008, you’ll be able to claim $10 for each drive as part of the class-action lawsuit. \nCNET reports that you don’t appear to need any proof of purchase, and that the settlement administrators are simply collecting names, email addresses, and the number of drives owned at the moment. You’ll need to submit a claim before July 1st, and the money won’t be released until other defendants in the litigation have settled. Sony, NEC, Panasonic, and Hitachi-LG have submitted $124.5 million to the overall settlement, leaving enough cash to compensate around 9.3 million DVD drive sales according to CNET . \nYou’ll need to be a resident of the following states to claim: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, or Wisconsin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:41:39.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
