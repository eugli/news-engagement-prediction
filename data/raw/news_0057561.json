And it’s difficult to see a beloved musical walk away without being recognized for its score. \nWhat could win: \"Moonlight\" If there is a spoiler (that applies for the movie not just counting this category but in the entire evening) it’s the moving strings in “Moonlight.” Best original song \"La La Land.\" Lionsgate \nWhat will win: “City of Stars” (“La La Land”) Again, it’s the music that’s the backbone of “La La Land,” and this is a main piece. What could win: “How Far I’ll Go” (“Moana”) If Academy voters are feeling in a history-setting mood, they may go with Lin-Manuel Miranda’s song. The win would make the “Hamilton” star the youngest person ever to win the famed EGOT . Best editing \"Arrival.\" Jan Thijs/Paramount Pictures \nWhat will win: “Arrival” Editing is important in every movie, but the use of it to deliver the powerful ending in “Arrival” should be recognized. What could win: “Moonlight” Used as a way to jump us forward in time with the blink of an eye, the editing in “Moonlight” is also top-notch. Best visual effects \"The Jungle Book.\" Disney \nWhat will win: “The Jungle Book” You can make a case for any of the nominees in this category, but seeing as Disney’s live-action reboot of the classic cartoon could never have worked without visual effects, this could give “The Jungle Book” the edge. What could win: “Doctor Strange” However, the most visually dazzling movie of 2016 is this Marvel title. Best documentary \"O.J.: Made in America.\" Sundance Film Festival \nWhat will win: “O.J.: Made in America” There’s really no other documentary that is worthy of the award. Its attention to detail and storytelling help make it a once-in-a-lifetime achievement. What could win: “13th” Director Ava DuVernay has a lot of friends in the Academy, so she could steal a win for the Netflix doc. Best cinematography \"Arrival.\" Jan Thijs/Paramount \nWhat will win: “Arrival” Bradford Young’s eye really gave this sci-fi movie something that most in the genre can’t pull off. What could win: “Moonlight” Filled with lush imagery, this one is also in the hunt for the prize. Best animated feature \"Zootopia.\" Disney \nWhat will win: “Zootopia” Disney’s mix of classic fun and a look at race and class is something that doesn’t come around often. What could win: “The Red Turtle” Hailed as one of the best movies of 2016, a story with no dialogue about a castaway living on a deserted island filled with turtles, crabs, and birds should not be counted out. Best adapted screenplay \"Moonlight.\" A24 \nWhat will win: “Moonlight” A big reason this powerful story looking at a man's life from childhood to adulthood is getting Oscar attention is its perfectly written script. What could win: \"Hidden Figures\" It’s the biggest crowd-pleaser out of all the Oscar nominees, and it could score an upset win. Best original screenplay \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Amazon Studios \nWhat will win: “Manchester by the Sea” Writer and director Kenneth Longergan’s script is compact but delivers when it needs to. What could win: “Hell or High Water” Personally, I think this is the best-written movie of 2016, but the Oscar buzz around “Manchester” could power its win (I hope I’m wrong). Best supporting actress Viola Davis in \"Fences.\" Paramount \nWho will win: Viola Davis, “Fences” Playing the wife who holds together a family filled with turmoil, Viola Davis gives a career-defining performance. Who could win: Octavia Spencer, “Hidden Figures” It would be a shock if Davis doesn’t get the win, but “Hidden Figures” has been shocking everyone for months with its runaway success. Best supporting actor Mahershala Ali in \"Moonlight.\" A24 \nWho will win: Mahershala Ali, “Moonlight” Ali playing a man trying to get a troubled kid on the straight and narrow is just a glimpse at the talents he will show us in future roles. Who could win: Jeff Bridges, “Hell or High Water” It’s the best performance by Bridges in years and gives the movie that added kick to make it not just a by-the-numbers bank-robber movie. Best actress Emma Stone in \"La La Land.\" Lionsgate \nWho will win: Emma Stone, “La La Land” It’s Emma’s year, honestly. Who could win: Isabelle Huppert, “Elle” It would be one of the biggest upsets in Oscar history, but Huppert has had quite a year, too. Best actor Casey Affleck in \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Amazon \nWho will win: Casey Affleck, “Manchester by the Sea” This is another tight one. Affleck has been the favorite all award season, but ... Who could win: Denzel Washington, “Fences” ... With some late-season wins under his belt, Washington has a good chance of winning. Best director Damien Chazelle on the set of \"La La Land.\" Lionsgate \nWho will win: Damien Chazelle, “La La Land” The incredible vision and execution of the movie will give Chazelle the win. Who could win: Barry Jenkins, “Moonlight” Jenkins and the movie have their loyal followers. It’s possible he gets it. Best picture \"La La Land.\" Lionsgate \nWhat will win: “La La Land” The best-director win usually dictates who gets the ultimate prize. I’m going with the frontrunner. What could win: “Moonlight” With the #OscarsSoWhite controversy of previous years, the “Moonlight” win would be validation, but hopefully if it does win, it will be remembered more for its art than the current issues surrounding the business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:08:58.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
