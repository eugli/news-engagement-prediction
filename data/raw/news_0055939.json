Danica Patrick (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 12:45 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 12:45 p.m. ET \nDanica Patrick understands the risk she takes when she gets behind the wheel. \nDuring Wednesday's Daytona 500 media day, the NASCAR sensation opened up about the state of concussions in the sport and highlighted the importance of drivers being vigilant about how their bodies react to them. \nMORE: NASCAR expands concussion protocol in latest push for driver safety \n\"I think that we'd like to sweep it all under the rug as drivers like we feel fine and nothing is wrong,\" Patrick said, via ESPN . \"But it's our life. If there was someone that told me or, I would hope any other driver, if you have another wreck, you could have a serious problem, then they would [choose to] be out. \n\"I would be out because I love what I do but I love lots of other things and I also love life. I'm too young to have it be over. It was a good lesson for a lot of people and a good education.\" \nPatrick praised Dale Earnhardt Jr., who missed the final 18 races of the 2016 NASCAR season after suffering his latest concussion, for leading by example and putting his health first. \n\"I've had concussions. Every time you crash, you have a concussion on a varying degree,\" Patrick said. \"When [Earnhardt] said something about having 12 concussions, I'm like, 'I'm sure I've had 12 concussions.' ... It makes you think for sure. \n\"It makes you pay attention to yourself, and there's nothing better than having somebody like Dale Jr. going as far as getting out of the car as long as he did, saying, 'Hey, I have a problem,' because it makes it more available to everyone else.\" \nPatrick recorded the best finish of her Monster Energy Cup Series career in last Sunday's exhibition race \"The Clash\" at Daytona when she ended the day with a fourth-place result. Earnhardt, a two-time Daytona 500 winner, will start from the front row for the fourth time this Sunday in the Great American Race.
