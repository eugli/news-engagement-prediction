Adorador III - @inquirerdotnet Inquirer Mindanao / 05:53   \nSURIGAO CITY – Local residents and netizens are abuzz about the remains of a large animal, which was washed ashore in Cagdianao town, Dinagat Islands province on Thursday. \nSufenia Chua of the Cagdianao Municipal Agriculture Office said that the carcass, which is believed to be that of a sea cow, was washed up on a beach along an area in Barangay Poblacion in Cagdianao. ADVERTISEMENT \nChua said the carcass measured 15 feet in length, but they are still trying to identify which species the dead animal belongs to as its remains are already in a state of advanced decomposition. \nNetizens, meanwhile, speculated that the carcass belongs to an alien species, while others said it may be an unknown deep sea creature. \nMany Facebook users said they are worried that the dead animal could be a harbinger of earthquakes. \nFollowing the magnitude 6.7 earthquake that hit Surigao City, photos of dead oarfish have widely circulated on Facebook, with many indicating that the mass deaths may have indicated a coming tremor. \nChua said they were still investigating the animal’s cause of death and that residents may have panicked over the carcass because they do not recognize it.
