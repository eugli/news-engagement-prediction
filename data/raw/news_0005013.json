He sent it to me, I sent it to my wife and his friends and my friends,” White said. \nSHERIFF BUSTED FOR SPEEDING ASKS FOR A TICKET \nOfficer Bob Osborne shared the video on social media and it picked up steam, being viewed hundreds of thousands of times. \nThey say it's an opportunity often not caught on camera and something that lifts spirits within the police department and with the public. \n\"We wrote him a ticket the time we stopped him. We still did our job. But, when we went back, you know the human always still comes out,” Osborne said. \nOFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER RISKED LIFE TO HELP OTHERS AFTER TANKER EXPLOSION \nThe officers saw the man didn't have a warm jacket. So, it inspired them to grab one and hold onto it in case they saw him again. \n“He's out there panhandling and does whatever he can to stay warm and fed, but I don't think that he gets people actually truly caring. And it felt nice for us, but I think he was appreciative himself that as not only just people, but as police officers we showed that we kept our word,” White added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:13:19.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
