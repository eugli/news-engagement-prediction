The debate which opened yesterday in the House of Lords is bigger simply than the issue of triggering Article 50 and beginning the arduous process of negotiating Britain’s way out of the European Union. It is about understanding the mood of ordinary people towards political elites — not just in Britain but across Europe and America. It is about unelected peers appreciating that ‘politics as usual’ is no longer acceptable. Whether you like it or not, the vote to leave the EU last June, against the wishes of the majority of the political Establishment, demonstrated a fundamental change in attitude from those who felt their views on everything from immigration to Brussels red tape and City fat-cats were being ignored by the people running the country. Baroness Smith of Basildon speaks in the House of Lords, London, during the debate on the Brexit Bil Elites The same trend is clear in America, where the election of Donald Trump as President was a resounding expression of dissatisfaction with the political status quo. Opinion polls in the run-up to elections across Europe this year show a similar pattern, with far-Right candidates leading in both Holland and France. Last Friday Tony Blair made a passionate and well-argued case for those who lost the referendum not to give up. He argued that Brexit was not ‘inevitable’, and called for pro-Europeans to ‘rise up in defence of what we believe’. His views were repeated in speeches yesterday in the House of Lords by some who felt that the referendum result was the wrong one. But people have had enough of elites telling them what to do — or telling them how wrong they’ve been. Last Friday Tony Blair made a passionate and well-argued case for those who lost the referendum not to give up And that is why, as we in the House of Lords decide whether to try to block the Article 50 Bill, and what amendments if any should be incorporated into it, it is vital to think of the broader political implications of our decisions. I am firmly of the opinion that the Lords should not hold up this Bill. Any sign that an unelected second chamber is seeking to thwart the withdrawal of Britain from the EU would be seen as acting in defiance of the people. It may be within the constitutional right of peers to try to prevent Brexit, but we should think twice before doing so. I say this with a heavy heart, as someone who voted and argued passionately to stay in the EU. I still believe it is a major mistake to detach ourselves from a European bloc of sufficient political weight to counter the rising power of China and India, never mind an increasingly belligerent Russia and a United States under President Trump. But the argument is over. Both sides presented their case — in my view extremely badly — and the people made up their minds. To ignore the consensus of the people, to dismiss their views, is to denigrate those on whose behalf politicians speak. It is surely the duty of politicians in any democracy to reflect the views of the people. That is why so many MPs, despite believing that we are making a grave error in leaving the EU, nevertheless voted to trigger Article 50. Yet despite this principled behaviour by MPs, the Liberal Democrats in the Lords are arguing for wrecking amendments to this simple Bill. These are the same Lib Dems who argued vehemently for an ‘in-out’ referendum on the EU whatever the outcome of David Cameron’s negotiations to improve Britain’s deal within Europe, yet because that referendum did not produce the right outcome refuse to accept the result. The same Liberal Democrats, too, who favour an elected House of Lords — which presumably means they should follow the will of the people and not just the views of those who have been elevated to a peerage. Perception is all in this debate — the significance of which was underlined by the symbolic visit of the Prime Minister to the Lords, where she sat on the steps of the throne in order to listen to the opening speeches. It is vital that peers involved in this debate appear to be looking after the people’s interests rather than their own. Many of the lords who have been expressing opinions over the past few days have a great deal of experience of the EU, having worked there or having been our representatives as Commissioners. Yet as this newspaper has pointed out, some of those who served in such capacities have considerable interests in the EU, not least in the form of pensions. And while their contributions to the debate are vital, they must be extremely careful not to put their personal situations before the country’s decision. These are the same Lib Dems who argued vehemently for an ‘in-out’ referendum on the EU whatever the outcome of David Cameron’s negotiations to improve Britain’s deal within Europe Challenge Given the expertise in the Lords, it is reasonable for the Upper House to consider or suggest amendments to the Bill before them. It makes sense, for example, to reinforce the commitments in the Bill that have already been made in Parliament. Not least, the right of Parliament to have a vote on the final Brexit package after it has been negotiated with Europe. It is not in any sense acceptable, however, to use the debate to block Article 50, thereby undermining the straightforward legislation which arose from the Supreme Court decision last month that Parliament should have the final say on Brexit.
