Getty Images \nPresident Donald Trump acknowledged during a Monday address to the National Governor's Association that the Affordable Care Act is the subject of rising approval ratings. \nBut he dismissed the sudden popularity of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. \n\"And it's interesting, it's sort of like you see it with politicians,\" he told the group of assembled governors from both major parties. \"You see it with President Obama, when you know he's getting out of office and the clock is ticking and he's not going to be there, his approval rating goes way up.

The approval rating increased by 6 percentage points since December 2016. \n\"Obamacare has failed,\" Trump said earlier in his remarks, later adding, \"As soon as we touch it ... they're going to say 'it's the Republicans problem.'
