Schooling was competing as part of the University of Texas at Austin’s Texas Longhorns swimming team. \nWhile he didn’t break the meet’s 100-yard freestyle record of 41.92sec, his split timing was the fastest among his teammates Jack Conger, Brett Ringgold and Townley Haas. \nSaturday’s performance was Schooling’s third record-breaking effort at the meet, having set new timings in the 100-yard butterfly and 50-yard freestyle events over the previous two days. \n“I think I had a good meet overall. There were a couple of things that I tried in this meet in preparation for the NCAAs (National Collegiate Athletic Association championships). From here, I will sit down with Eddie to discuss on ho to approach the NCAAs,” said Schooling after the meet, referring to his team’s coach Eddie Reese. \nNaturally, all this winning this left the Olympic 100m butterfly champion feeling a little knackered, as seen in his Instagram Daily post following the meet.
