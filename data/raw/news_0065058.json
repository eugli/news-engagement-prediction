Samsung is expected to unveil a new tablet , Lenovo might reveal new Moto Mods for its Moto Z line of phones, and of course, plenty of companies are going all-in with wearables this year. \nOne company we’re following really closely is Withings , the French consumer electronics company that recently got scooped up by Nokia . Prior to the Nokia acquisition, Withings was doing a lot of interesting things in the wearable space. The company’s Activité Steel activity tracker is still one of our favorite fitness trackers on the market, and we’re big fans of the Steel HR , too.

Withings has just announced that it’ll join Nokia for “an exciting keynote announcement” at MWC this year. Just under 1 week until we join @Nokia for an exciting Keynote announcement at Mobile World Congress—you won’t want to miss it. #MWC17 pic.twitter.com/Ow4xI29Mqp \n— Withings (@Withings) February 21, 2017 \nNokia’s keynote is taking place in Barcelona on Sunday, February 26. As for what’s being announced at that keynote? All we can really do is speculate for now. \nSince Withings has always focused on connected health devices, we’re assuming the announcement will entail a wearable of some sort. Could it be a follow up to the Steel HR? What about a new Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch? It’s worth noting that as of right now, we don’t have confirmation that Withings will unveil a new product. The tweet certainly suggests that we’ll see some new hardware, but nothing’s confirmed at this time. \nWhat do you think we’ll see from Withings at MWC this year? Let us know in the comments!
