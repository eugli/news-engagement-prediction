Incidence of voter fraud is a verifiable fact and faith and facts aren’t like Bill Pullman and Bill Paxton. When you confuse them, it actually matters. Real people get hurt when you make policy based on false information. Billions will get spent on a wall that won’t work to prevent a crimewave that isn’t happening while refugees sit in dangerous situations to prevent Bowling Green-style massacres that never took place.” Related Samantha Bee praises CNN for feeding ‘flaxen-haired fountain of lies’ Kellyanne Conway to Jake Tapper \nOliver’s solution? Since Trump likes cable news so much, he’ll begin buying ads for the Washington, D.C. area on major news outlets, like MSNBC, CNN and Fox News, in hopes that the president will catch a few and learn something, like climate change, how to use appetizer forks and what his other daughter’s name is. “Until we’re shut down,” Oliver said, “we are prepared to educate Donald Trump one by one on topics we’re pretty sure he doesn’t know about.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:30:58.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
