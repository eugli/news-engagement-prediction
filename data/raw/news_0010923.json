MAARTEN HOLL/FAIRFAX NZ \nClaire Gilroy, emergency medical dispatcher for Wellington Free Ambulance and central emergency communications, is an expert in keeping calm and carrying on. \nThe central communications emergency medical dispatcher has been in the job eight years, and it still gets to her. \nREAD MORE: * CuriousCity: What happens if wasps invade your home * CuriousCity: What lurks beneath Wellington Harbour \nThat same weekend a few years ago she also picked up calls on a childbirth and a stabbing. MAARTEN HOLL/FAIRFAX NZ \nCentral emergency communications call-taker Claire Gilroy says some people call 111 for animals. \n\"It was one of those weekends, you're always going to remember it. But as long as you don't let it affect you personally, you don't take it home.\" \nThen there are the calls from people who hit possums, or the woman who screamed \"my baby's been hit by a car\" only for paramedics to find, on arrival, it was a kitten. \nAt any one time, up to five call takers are at work on the phones at the Wellington Free Ambulance headquarters in Davies St, which doubles as a central communications centre and is run jointly with St John Ambulance. JOHN NICHOLSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nWellington Free ambulances covered 2.5 million kilometres in 2015/16. \nThey can tap into the St John centres in Auckland and Christchurch if there is a backlog. Ad Feedback \nGilroy can also be called upon to relieve other centres, so call-takers need to pass a national geography test to get the job. \nCentral communications team manager Richard Schulze said being able to pinpoint was not just about accuracy, but empathy. MAARTEN HOLL/FAIRFAX NZ \nMore than 100,000 calls for help were handled by Wellington Free Ambulance dispatchers in 2015/16. \n\"It helps you build that rapport. If you're spending the first two minutes of a call trying to isolate where they are, they get very frustrated.\" \nWhen a call comes in, it's immediately colour-coded based on its severity. \nPurple is immediately life threatening, red is life threatening or time critical, orange is urgent, green is non-urgent and grey is simply something to be aware of. \n\"Purple is literally - you drop everything,\" Schulze says. \nOur visit is the day before the Guns N' Roses concert at Westpac Stadium and the stage set-up is flagged as a grey job. \n\"We've got a paramedic there watching, making sure no-one gets a crate dropped on their foot.\" \nThere's no endless supply of ambulances, so they have to make tough calls. \n\"You might have two calls of equal seriousness, but only one ambulance ... for that one you don't send the ambulance to, potentially, they're not going to be very happy.\" \nGilroy says one of the hardest things is not knowing how the story ends. \nStaff are separated from the paramedics, so usually they know where a patient has been taken, but finding out anything after that is difficult. \n\"It's sort of like reading a book and getting to the end and someone's ripped out the last page.\" \nSchulze says it was common, and encouraged, for staff to take a short time-out after particularly tough calls. \nThe company's counselling service was accessed 360 times last year by staff. \nBut while they're at the coalface, a brave face is the only way to get through the 12-hour shifts, Gilroy says. \n\"We know that if we sound stressed or panicked it's just going to heighten what they're going through. So you keep yourself calm,\" she says. \n\"The person at the end of the phone could be a family member or a friend, and we want to get help to them as soon as possible.\" \nBY THE NUMBERS: \n4,200,000 dollars collected through fundraising in 2015/16 2,500,000 kilometres covered 101,000 calls for help answered 48,000 emergencies responded to 14,000 call outs for falls 3500 people saved a trip to hospital through phone advice and referrals 2000 people trained in CPR 1420 callouts for road accidents 592 events provided with medical care 200 cardiac arrest callouts attended \nASK AWAY Have we piqued your CuriousCity?
