Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, a panelist that night in Houston, directed his first question to Ted Cruz.\n\"Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices?\" Hewitt asked.\nLike others in the conservative media, Hewitt was concerned that Trump — who previously described himself as \" very pro-choice \" — would be unreliable. After Cruz deflected the inquiry, Hewitt questioned Trump directly.\n\"Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?\" he asked.\n\"Yes, I would,\" Trump replied.\nIf Hewitt had any lingering doubts, Trump put them to rest Tuesday night when he nominated Colorado federal appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch to replace Scalia.\nBravo. Judge Neil Gorsuch soon to fill the seat of an extraordinary man on #SCOTUS \n— Hugh Hewitt (@hughhewitt) February 1, 2017 \n\n\"Standing here in a house of history and acutely aware of my own imperfections...\" The opinions will be brilliant.\n— Hugh Hewitt (@hughhewitt) February 1, 2017 \n\nNotes the seat is not just Justice Scalia's but also Justice Robert Jackson. Wow.\n— Hugh Hewitt (@hughhewitt) February 1, 2017 \n\nMoreover, the president's selection of Gorsuch was viewed in the conservative press as a promise kept — even by some harsh Trump critics.\nConservatives are going to love this pick ... https://t.co/Tha1iFSLO7 \n— Charlie Sykes (@SykesCharlie) February 1, 2017 \n\nTonight, President Trump United the GOP and the Right https://t.co/oGXogPcnqP \n— Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) February 1, 2017 \n\nI'm THRILLED.

Now your turn, Senator McConnell. #Gorsuch #SCOTUS \n— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) February 1, 2017 \n\nNo one can fill Nino Scalia's shoes, but lawyers and law profs whom I trust think Gorsuch would have as good a chance as anyone to do so. https://t.co/Gi6GeSj5dZ \n— Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) January 31, 2017 \n\nIf Trump wants to win over conservatives in the media who opposed him during the campaign, he took a big step on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:15:00.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
