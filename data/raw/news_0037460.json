Image caption Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville were involved in the development of Hotel Football, near their former club's Old Trafford stadium \nLast week Neville said the project, which would also see a synagogue rebuilt, would be \"one of the biggest statements in architecture in modern times in Manchester\" . \nHundreds of people have signed a petition against the plans. \nNeville and Giggs were involved in the development of Hotel Football, near their former club's Old Trafford stadium. \nThey are also turning the former Manchester Stock Exchange into a luxury hotel. \nBefore renovation work started earlier this year, they allowed homeless people to stay in the building.
