These include global temperature rise sufficient to lose the Greenland Ice Sheet and generate ... Should the role of afforestation in climate change mitigation policy be re-evaluated? November 24, 2014 \nAfforestation (planting trees) to mitigate climate change could cause warming rather than cooling globally due to non-carbon effects of land use change, according to new research from the University of Bristol. Warming ponds could accelerate climate change February 20, 2017 \nRising temperatures could accelerate climate change by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide stored in ponds and increasing the methane they release, new research shows. CO2 Modeller brings climate change and emissions targets within touching distance November 25, 2015 \nScientists and computer engineers at the University of Southampton have developed an interactive climate app - CO2 Modeller - which can fit in your pocket and help you to gauge the future effects of carbon emissions around ... Projections about global emissions cannot accurately factor in economic booms December 13, 2016 \nResearchers have charted the relationship between carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and GDP, known to scientists as global 'emission intensity'. A new measure of global warming from carbon emissions June 10, 2009 \nDamon Matthews, a professor in Concordia University's Department of Geography, Planning and the Environment has found a direct relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and global warming. Matthews, together with colleagues ... Recommended for you Atmospheric rivers found to carry more wind than thought February 22, 2017 \n(Phys.org)â€”A pair of researchers with the California Institute of Technology and the University of California has found evidence that suggests atmospheric rivers carry wind speeds higher than has been thought. In their ... Computer model predicts the likelihood of crossing several dangerous climate change thresholds February 22, 2017 \nA new computer model of accumulated carbon emissions predicts the likelihood of crossing several dangerous climate change thresholds. These include global temperature rise sufficient to lose the Greenland Ice Sheet and generate ... Biogeochemical links across Greenland key to understanding Arctic February 22, 2017 \nThe Kangerlussuaq region of southwest Greenland is a 3,728-square-mile corridor stretching from the ice sheet to the Labrador Sea. In this area near the top of the world, landscape and ecosystem diversity abounds. Flora and ... Experiments call origin of Earth's iron into question February 21, 2017 \nNew research from The University of Texas at Austin reveals that the Earth's unique iron composition isn't linked to the formation of the planet's core, calling into question a prevailing theory about the events that shaped ... Over time, nuisance flooding can cost more than extreme, infrequent events February 21, 2017 \nGlobal climate change is being felt in many coastal communities of the United States, not always in the form of big weather disasters but as a steady drip, drip, drip of nuisance flooding. Fifth of world's food lost to over-eating and waste, study finds February 21, 2017 \nAlmost 20 per cent of the food made available to consumers is lost through over-eating or waste, a study suggests. 1 comment", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:20:07.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
