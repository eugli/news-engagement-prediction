Chelsea can, with similar certainty, question how on earth Alonso is meant to jump with his arms glued by his sides like a 6ft 3in salmon trying to leap upstream.\nThe picture from before the header (below )shows both players using their arms to jump as high as possible. Discount this. It will not fit your narrative. \nIndeed you can argue with all of your screengrabs, but a still picture very rarely does justice to the moving image and while a later snap of Alonso's forearm buried in Bellerín's face seems similarly affirming of his guilt, remember one thing: it isn't. \nHector Bellerin and Marcos Alonso both jump for a header (Getty) Usually with contentious refereeing decisions the question should be \"can you see why the official gave what he did?\" rather than \"do you agree with the decision?\"\nThis will be lost in the fury and counter fury. And while Arsenal will feel unfairly punished by this - having conceded the goal and then lost one of their substitutions early in the game - they never really looked to be in this encounter. \nOf more concern should be that, with this perceived injustice in mind, the Gunners should have kicked on and been stirred by this feeling. This anger. \nCourtois easily palmed away Arsenal's best chance (AFP/Getty Images) \nInstead, Chelsea's dominance was convincing and rarely challenged, with the Gunners' best chance coming when Gabriel Paulista, of all people, rose in the box to head unmarked. He only succeeded in finding Thibaut Courtois's windmill arms. Arsenal's late consolation goal through Olivier Giroud would feel almost embarrassing. \nEventually the hosts' superiority paid with a second goal and it was stunning. Eden Hazard, picking the ball up in midfield, ran the long way round Francis Coquelin, shouldering the Frenchman away until he ended up performing something of a barrel roll, like a stunt double trying to dive in through the window of a moving car. \nWith Coquelin on the turf, Hazard ran at Laurent Koscielny, juking outside him before catching an early strike that looped over an over-committed Petr Cech. It was 2-0 and it was, undeniably, curtains - as this title race appears to be. \nCesc Fabregas' sensational third, loopy and wild, cemented the result. It emphasised the pain. It may, in part, further diminish the feeling of injustice over Marcos Alonso's goal but don't hold your breath. \nThe 'elbow' - what they said Graeme Souness on Sky Sports: \"He's only got eyes for the ball, it's not a foul.\"\nThierry Henry on Sky Sports: \" Obviously I hope that Bellerin is okay but it is a fair challenge.\"\nDanny Mills on Radio 5 Live: \" There is contact, but both players are coming for the ball. I don't think it's a foul.\"\nDermot Gallagher on Radio 5 Live: : “Good goal. He’s gone fairly and didn’t leap with the arm.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T16:35:18.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
