It' s beautiful, it's shimmery, it's elegant and at $39.99 it is unbelievably affordable.\" \nAs McCarthy delivers her sales pitch, the bangle's price and a phone number for ordering it appear at the bottom of the shot. \nThen she launches into a promotion for Ivanka Trump's shoes. \n\"And don’t even get me started on her shoes because these babies are a real head-turner,\" McCarthy says while lifting up her leg to show off Ivanka Trump's $135 \"Katie\" pumps. \nTrump lashed out at Nordstrom last week on Twitter for dropping Ivanka's fashion line. \n\"My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by Nordstrom,\" Trump tweeted. \"She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!\" \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer later backed up Trump's statement, saying Nordstrom's decision was a \"direct attack on his policies and [Ivanka's] name.\" Then Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway entered the conflict when she told people to \" go buy Ivanka's stuff .\" She was later accused of an ethics violation . \nNordstrom said it dropped Ivanka Trump's line because sales were sliding. \nThe skit might have been targeting more than the Nordstrom feud, however. \nPolitico reported last week that President Trump is unhappy with Spicer's portrayal by a woman on the comedy show, because he doesn't like his people to \"look weak.\" McCarthy first appeared as Spicer on SNL a week ago. \nIt's possible that the report played a role in SNL's decision to have McCarthy donning heels and jewelry in its latest episode.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T17:35:28.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
