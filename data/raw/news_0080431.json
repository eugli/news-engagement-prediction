But I love traveling with them, I love seeing the world through their eyes. And I love going places where they are welcomed. \nYou will find China one of the most kid-friendly places on earth. It ranks right up there with Italy and Greece . No one will blink an eye when they make noise in the hotel lobby or at dinner. While there won't be changing tables in most restrooms, you'll find help in other ways. I've had a cook on her way home come by, pick my baby up out of my arms and hold her for the duration of my dinner. Chinese people love kids. It's truly wonderful. \nAnd your kids will have a fabulous time as long as you create your trip to include plenty of things they'll like. There are loads of kids' activities that range from museums and romper rooms in big cities, to exploring the sights you're interested in outside. More » Famous Shanghai fried dumplings at Bao Luo.

Pandas and tigers and camels, oh my!* \nGuess which two of those animals you can get up close and personal with? \nCome to China and you can see giant pandas in their natural habitat if you're lucky. But you can also go to Chengdu and visit the panda breeding base there and see them up close. For a hefty donation you can even cuddle and hold a baby. \nYou can venture to the far west like Gansu Province on the Gobi Desert and ride a camel . You can probably even find one for hire hanging out for tourists at popular sections of the Great Wall . Camels are not as cuddly as pandas. \nAnd for the least cuddly, we have Siberian Tigers . You won't find one of these in the wild but you can see them in animal parks, namely in Harbin . \n*Non-American readers, this is a reference to a quote in the classic film The Wizard of Oz .

From curios to tea , scarves to bespoke suits , strands of real pearls to the latest in fake handbags , the shopping can be addictive. I've even taken a few visitors to buy extra suitcases too.

Traditional Chinese Medicine & Massage \nMassage is not a special treat in these parts, it's more like a way of life. There are many kinds of traditional massage therapies in Chinese Medicine, but spas and massage parlors offer just about anything you can think of, for a very reasonable price (if you stay out of the five-star hotels). Many folks spend afternoons at bath-houses like Xiao Nan Guo Spa in Shanghai where you can go and soak, get scrubbed, massaged, manicured and fed all for a very reasonable price. And be sure to add a good foot massage to the end of any day of sightseeing. More » Li River scenery. © Sara Naumann, licensed to About.com. 9.
