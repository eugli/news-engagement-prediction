Alexis’s credits included Pulp Fiction and The Wedding Singer , according to IMDb. Patricia said the exclusion was particularly timely, given President Trump’s recent action regarding trans Americans’ civil rights regarding bathroom use . “I think that was a real slight to the trans community, especially at this time when trans kids can’t even go to the bathroom in the United States of America at school. It says a lot about the lack of inclusion — trans kids can really never look at anyone and see their heroes, and I think that was a big mistake,” Arquette said.\nTags: patricia arquette alexis arquette oscars 2017 movies Patricia Arquette Criticizes Oscars for Excluding Her Sister   The Walking Dead Recap: Welcome Home, Haircut Here Are Your 2017 Oscar Winners Most   16 mins ago What’s Leaving Hulu: March 2017 Adiós, Amélie .\n5:39 p.m. Patricia Arquette Slams Oscars for Excluding Her Trans Sister From ‘In Memoriam’ “I think that was a real slight to the trans community.”\n5:09 p.m. What’s Leaving Netflix: March 2017 Don’t miss Taika Waititi’s Boy. \n4:55 p.m. WATCH:  \n4:55 p.m. Despite  \n4:41 p.m. Ryan  \n4:41 p.m. How Did  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:41:45.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
