(He was sentenced to five years' probation and six months of community service following the attack.) \nReports of the restraining order come several weeks after an odd video of Brown circulated social media last month where the singer admits to being overzealous in his relationships. \n“Ladies, y’all be complaining about n---as being like stalkers and in love with y’all, kinda crazy and shit, and you get tired of ‘em,\" he said in the clip. \"Well guess what? I’m one of ‘em n----s! If I love you, b-tch, ain’t nobody gon’ have you. I’m gon’ make you miserable. I’m going to chase that n---a out, and I’m gonna chase you around, and it’s done.\" A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom) on Jan 31, 2017 at 4:40am PST \nThe restraining order reportedly demands that Brown stay 100 yards away from Tran, her mother and her brother. \nReps for Brown and Tran did not immediately respond to Billboard 's requests for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:16:22.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
