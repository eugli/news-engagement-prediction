Has Cavani Been Dropped From Blanc's XI For Good? â€“ PSG Talk - psgtalk.com Advertisements \nIf reports from Talksport are to be believed, Paris Saint-Germain 's Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani is refusing to sign a new deal at the club from the French capital, as Manchester United and Arsenal wait in the wings. A wonderful campaign for Cavani \nThe former Napoli man, who turned 30 on Valentine's Day this year, has racked up an impressive tally of 32 goals this season, making him the highest-scoring player in all of the European leagues this season. \nAfter having previously struggled to get ample amount of game-time in the presence of #Zlatan Ibrahimovic under former manager Laurent Blanc, Cavani seems to be flourishing under Unai Emery during the ongoing campaign. \nWhile, Cavani has been an outstanding contributor to PSG this season, his current deal at Parc des Princes runs out in 2018 and Les Parisiens are looking to tie their forward down to a new deal as soon as possible. \nIt is said that the goal-machine had been in talks with his clubs to sign a new deal for over several months, but negotiations have gone sour since January and the 30-year-old is refusing to put pen to paper on what is supposed to be a new two-year deal. \nIt's obvious that Emery would be desperate to hold onto Cavani, considering that they don't have a proper centre-forward to play with this season and also because they would want to offload him at his maximum prize. A possibility for Manchester United and Arsenal? \nThe Uruguayan has been on # Manchester United 's radar for quite sometime now and the Red Devils have previously made contact with their striker target, who has also been touted to be a target at the Emirates. \nUnited clearly won't rely on Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a long-term basis and there could possibly be the need to sign a younger forward, who can fill the gap between Marcus Rashford 's prime and Ibrahimovic's apparent retirement. Their pursuit for Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann suggests that they are after a goal-getter this summer. \nArsenal though, would be well aware of Alexis Sanchez 's situation at the club. As a host of former Barcelona man's fans prepare to organize a rally demanding his exit from the Emirates, the Gunners could well explore their goal scoring options this summer. #Paris Saint Germain Advertisements ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:07:49.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
