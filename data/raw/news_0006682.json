Just a few White House staff members would have access to transcripts of the President’s “worst call by far” of the day, in which he even reportedly held the phone away from his ear in disgust. What goes on in the Oval Office is normally top secret, yet one of Mr Trump’s trusted inner circle has chosen to share details of the combative call with the press. Why? There are two possibilities. Either Mr Trump was behind it and wanted the world to know about his anger at Australia and Barack Obama over the “dumb deal”— perhaps to save himself from being “killed politically” if he does go through with it. Or someone did it without the President’s knowledge, a massively bold and risky step, but a potentially very smart one. The leak of the details of the abrasive call can only have come from a handful of trusted senior advisers. Picture: Alex Brandon/AP Photo Source: AP ‘LEAKIEST WHITE HOUSE EVER’ Leaks are becoming a feature of the new administration. Details of Mr Trump’s equally abrasive phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto were also revealed, with the President reportedly threatening to send US troops into the neighbouring country. His team later explained this was “light-hearted”. There have been gossipy revelations about the President’s obsessive TV-watching and tantrums and a military leak about a fatal raid in Yemen having lacked preparation. Another leak came ahead of Mr Trump’s Supreme Court pick on Tuesday, The Washington Post reported, when Judges Thomas Hardiman and Neil Gorsuch were reportedly asked to start driving towards Washington DC to create the illusion the selective process was still competitive. The staged race-against-time story doesn’t do the former reality star’s image any favours. So who would want to make the President look like a desperate attention-seeker? Top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway has insisted in recent days that the leaks do not come from the US government. “It’s not being leaked by the White House,” Ms Conway told Fox & Friends when asked whether the State Department could be behind the leaks. “It’s dangerous to have these leaks, whether it’s the intelligence reports earlier ... or calls like this.” Her words implied Australia could be behind them, which seems highly unlikely when the Prime Minister wants voters to see the refugee question as a done deal. Former Australian ambassador to the US Kim Beazley was in no doubt: “These leaks did not come from Australia in any shape or form. They came entirely from within the US bureaucracy,” he told ABC radio. The aborted call is an embarrassment and a headache for the Prime Minister as he waits to see if Mr Trump will honour the refugee deal made with Barack Obama.

As ludicrous as it sounds, many commentators are suggesting the leaks come from members of the administration who are trying to rein in the rogue commander-in-chief. The New York Times reported that “ three administration officials who did not want to be identified” revealed that Judge Hardiman had hit the road to ramp up the drama ahead of the Supreme Court decision. They could be trying to embarrass the President into speaking to world leaders with more respect, much as you would teach a misbehaving child a lesson. With Mr Trump using the unorthodox method of tweeting to bypass the media and get his message across, senior politicians and civil servants may be doing the same. Former Labor leader Mr Beazley said American officials who feel that they can’t get their point across to the President are likely to leak to help their cause. Mr Trump only really listens to things once he sees them in the media, according to Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post with Ms Conway even confessing during the campaign that the best way to talk to him was often to go on cable TV or speak to reporters. Others suggest it is a means to undermine him, and that many of those closest to the President are looking for ways to chip away at his power. If Mr Trump remains this uncontrollable, it could be hugely damaging to the Republican party and America’s diplomatic relationships with the world. The President’s closest advisers say an uneasy atmosphere of distrust pervades the White House.

After all, he is a master of media manipulation, having previously posed as his own spokesman and rewritten hist. During his contentious call with Mr Turnbull, those in the room with Mr Trump were chief strategist Steve Bannon, national security adviser Mike Flynn and White House press secretary Sean Spicer. It has been suggested that they concocted the leak between them. The fiery call shows Mr Trump is tough, that he does not like the refugee deal masterminded by his predecessor and that he will make Australia reciprocate the favour if it does have to go ahead. This is exactly the narrative the President wants the public to believe. Rather than being infuriated by the supposedly embarrassing leaks, an unflustered Mr Trump on Thursday told listeners “not to worry” about the phone calls. “The world is in trouble, but we are going to straighten it out, okay?” he said at a National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. “That is what I do — I fix things. “Believe me, when you hear about the tough phone calls I’m having, don’t worry about it. Just don’t worry about it. They’re tough. We have to be tough. It’s time we’re going to be a little tough, folks. “We are taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually. It is not going to happen any more.” But in a final twist, in yet further leaks, Trump aides have painted a picture of a culture of distrust poisoning the White House. “Trying to nail down who the leakers are is like trying to count the cockroaches under the couch ,” close adviser Michael Caputo told Politico . The details of the controversial travel ban were reportedly jealously guarded from many Trump allies because “someone would have leaked it”, said one aide. Another summed up the new era: “People are just knifing each other.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:32:31.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
