Williams, in his 11th NBA season on his fourth team, is averaging 18.6 points and 3.2 assists in just over 24 minutes per game this season. It's the highest scoring average of his career, by more than three points per game. \nShould a trade to Charlotte be consummated in the next two days, it's not known what the Lakers might receive in return. \nThe Hornets are also said to be interested in Nets forward Bojan Bogdanovic. \nWilliams reportedly has other suitors in the Jazz, Magic, Wizards and Bulls. \nJohnson had been a team adviser before getting promoted Tuesday to president of basketball operations. He replaces Jim Buss and will also serve as the team's interim general manager with the Lakers also firing GM Mitch Kupchak on Tuesday. \nJohnson spent his entire 13-year playing career with the Lakers, helping to lead them to five NBA championships.
