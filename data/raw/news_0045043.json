Following the album's May 5th release, the two artists will embark on a short tour in the U.S. and Europe. Related Amanda Palmer on Crowdfunding and the Rebirth of the Working Musician 'Being transparent works because people fundamentally like supporting artists' \nPalmer is a longtime fan of Ka-Spel's group. She initially met the band in 1992 and later hosted several members of the group when they played in the United States in 1995. More than 20 years later, the duo started work on I Can Spin a Rainbow last spring at a studio in England owned by Imogen Heap. \n\"We merged our songwriting heads and poetic worlds to make a new universe,\" Palmer said in a statement. \"We would sit in Imogen's house drinking cups of tea, bemoaning the state of the upcoming election, binge drinking in the U.K., the refugee crisis, our internet addictions, frightening news we had read, our relationships ... and then we'd compost all of the ingredients of our fears and conversations into song form.\" \nPalmer described the resulting album as \"a spiritual experience.\" \"The rainbow metaphor – which is also a nod to the 'spinning beach ball of death' on a Mac – was a wide-open image that kept popping up as a recurring theme on the record,\" Palmer added. \"It's both dark and light at the same time. To me, the songs are simultaneously frightening and comforting, like a thunderstorm heard from a living room.\" \nI Can Spin a Rainbow is set for a May 5th release. Palmer and Ka-Spel kick off the American leg of their subsequent tour on May 17th in Boston, where Palmer first saw the Legendary Pink Dots more than two decades ago. After five American dates, the band heads to Europe. Tickets are available via Palmer's website . \nI Can Spin a Rainbow Track List \n1. Pulp Fiction3. The Shock of Kontakt4. Beyond The Beach5.
