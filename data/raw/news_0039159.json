But is there not a glaring double standard here? While it might be the oldest public office in Australia – dating back to Captain Arthur Philip in 1786 – the NSW governor is in reality a costly anachronism. Advertisement \nAs the Berejiklian government continues to cut public servant numbers, NSW Governor David Hurley earns an annual salary of $467,640 – almost $100,000 more than the Premier's $377,780. \nNot only that, but the taxpayer continues to provide substantial financial support for the former governor, Dame Marie Bashir, under a specially struck agreement. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Mike Baird made an arrangement with Marie Bashir on her retirement as governor that taxpayers would cover the costs of her continuing commitments. Photo: Peter Rae \nDame Marie left the job in 2014 after 13 years, but the government argues she continues as patron to dozens of community organisations, therefore it is pleased to offer her financial support. \nThe most recently published full-year figures show she claimed $496,234 last financial year. \nThis included $120,433 in staff salaries, $133,347 in drivers' salaries and $198,216 in office rent. The figure for 2014-15 was just over $400,000. \nFigures published last week show that to December 31, Dame Marie has claimed $278,324 – on track to crack the half-million mark in this financial year. \nThe Department of Premier and Cabinet says the budget for running Government House for 2016-17 is a hefty $5.7 million. \n\"This includes all operating costs, such as salaries and related expenses, travel, security and building maintenance,\" a spokeswoman said. \nFormer NSW premier Bob Carr had the right idea in 1996 when he controversially announced the governor would no longer reside in Government House, opening up the grounds and building for public use. The move effectively reduced the NSW governor to a part-time position. \nCarr was pilloried by constitutional monarchists, who got their way 15 years later when Barry O'Farrell reversed the decision within seven months of becoming premier in 2011. \nIdeally, the office of NSW governor should be abolished. Unfortunately, it's not that simple; there are significant constitutional impediments. \nSo at the very least, in the spirit of the government's enthusiasm for getting the most out of Sydney's historic buildings, Carr's idea for opening up the place to community groups for arts and other programs should be explored. \nThere is no good reason for the governor to reside in Government House, which remains an impediment to the public's full enjoyment of the place. \nOn the occasion of a swearing-in of a new cabinet, he could pop down for the ceremony and host the afternoon tea afterwards, as is the current practice. \nHow likely is it that the newly installed Premier will consider such a move? Not very. \nBut, encouragingly, there were some stirrings of potential republican insurrection during the swearing-in of the new Berejiklian cabinet. Several ministers, including Ray Williams, Matt Kean and Mark Speakman, swore their allegiance to the people of NSW instead of the Queen. \nAsked about this afterwards, Kean explained: \"I was proud to pledge my loyalty to the people of NSW. They are the ones that elected me and they are the ones who I am going to fight for every single day.\" \nWhen O'Farrell brought the governor back to Government House, it was presumably closely tied to his admiration for Dame Marie, who has now left the office. \nSurely the time is right to gently evict the governor once again and return Government House to the people. \nSean Nicholls is state political editor Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T10:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:44:37.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
