(between Chukwunwike Vs President Buhari), was shown to the witness who identified the name of the lawyer (Mr. Awodehin), as the third person representing the president in the suit.] \nQuestion: Was Kola Awodeyin, SAN, the one who passed off the gift of N500,000? \nAnswer: Yes \nAs a follow up to the response by Mr. Adepoju, Mr. Agi’s lawyer asked whether the N500,000 given at a time when Mr. Buhari had a pending case before Mr. Ademola, amounted to a bribe, so that the judge would rule in his favour. \nMr. Adepoju answered in the negative, stressing that “such would amount to a speculation in my opinion”. \nMr. Adepoju also added that his office did not investigate further to determine the authenticity or otherwise of the claim by Mr. Agi. \nAt least 10 suits challenging the eligibility of Mr. Buhari to contest the 2015 presidential election came before the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court. \nThe suits were later consolidated into two, since they all sought similar actions from the court of law. \nIn one of the suits, Chukwunweike Okafor sought an order compelling the Independent National Electoral Commission to remove or delete Mr. Buhari’s name and that of the All Progressives Congress from the list of persons and political parties running for the office of president. \nMr. Okafor asked the court to hold that the information supplied by the APC flag-bearer in Form C.F 001 that his West African School Certificate was with the Nigerian Army was false and should be disqualified from the race. \nIn another suit, Max Ozoaka asked the court to disqualify Mr. Buhari on the ground that the INEC Form Cf 001 the APC candidate submitted to INEC was incomplete. \nThe suits were, however, struck out days before the general election in April 2015. \nMessrs. Hubert and Bassey had been identified on Monday as donating $150,000 to Justice Ademola for his daughter’s wedding. The money was later converted into N37 million. \nMr. Adepoju, who stated this in court, could however not trace the donors of the money to any case involving Mr. Ademola, or any of the defendants. \nOn Tuesday the prosecution closed its case against the judge, after presenting all its witnesses. \nLawyer to Mr. Ademola, Onyeachi Ikpeazu, thereafter told the court that his client would like to make a no-case-submission. \nThe trial judge, Jude Okeke, adjourned the matter till March 15 for hearing of the application.
