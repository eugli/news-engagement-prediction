(NNS) -- Rear Adm.

Established in 1972 by former Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Elmo Zumwalt and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy John Whittet, the SOY program recognizes individual Sailors who best represent the group of dedicated professional Sailors at each command and ultimately the Navy. \"The SOY program is significant because it highlights the outstanding performance of the top first class petty officers within the type commands,\" said Chief Hospital Corpsman Nekeia Borders, SURFLANT SOY coordinator. \"The two [Sailors of the Year] from Atlantic Sea and Shore will go on to compete for the opportunity to be meritoriously advanced to chief petty officer at U.S. Fleet Forces Command.\" Ten Surface Force Atlantic SOY finalists from sea and shore met with SURFLANT selection board of master chief petty officers during the competition. \"I believe it's important to recognize Sailors for the things they do along with their accomplishments,\" said Command Master Chief Melissa Black, Littoral Combat Ship Squadron 2. \"At the end of the day, we want to say they are all winners and they should be proud of the command they represent.\" \"In my 27 years in the Navy, I'm still [impressed] by this event,\" said Black. \"These Sailors are my belief that I am turning over our future to some great leaders.\" For more information, visit www.navy.mil , www.facebook.com/usnavy , or www.twitter.com/usnavy .
