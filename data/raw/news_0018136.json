He was interviewed by one of your colleagues to talk about the derby and in the course of a sentence they said to him \"but would you [leave one day]?\"\nLyon president Jean-Michel Aulas says Lacazette is struggling after talk of him leaving\n'Alexandre hasn't betrayed the club. He simply said that one day if like his friend Sam [Umtiti] he could go play for Barcelona or if like Karim Benzema, who left for Real Madrid and everyone was happy for him, he could go to a big club, he might.'\nAulas was particularly frustrated that the interview was published ahead of Lyon's derby against St Etienne — which they lost — last weekend.\n'Why bring that out on the day of a derby?' he said. 'You're putting huge pressure on kids... in front of thousands of people who don't understand. I'm disappointed and it upset me.'\nThe interview which led to Lacazette's problems saw him tell Canal+ that he might seek a 'change of scenery' in the summer.\nThe striker scored for Lyon in their 4-0 win over Nancy but looks set for a summer move\n'I think that the right moment has arrived to leave,' Lacazette said.\n'I think that this summer I will need a change of scenery and discover something else, still with the idea of advancing and progressing in terms of football and as a person.\n'I will continue to work, in the hope that good opportunities will come this summer.'\nAulas has said he will not stand in the striker's way if one of Europe's giants come in for him.", "external_links": ["http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5b2846_24e-j-aulas-lacazette-est-detruit_sport"], "published": "2017-02-09T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:14:57.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
