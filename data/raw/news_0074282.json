Choose a chalet stay \nStaying in a chalet or chalet-hotel takes a lot of the guesswork out of how much you’ll end up spending once in resort. Chalet-board means you get a cooked breakfast, afternoon tea (usually including soup and cake) and a three-course dinner every day bar one – the chalet hosts’ day off. Unlimited chalet wine is frequently included, meaning you can also save money on bar hopping if you wish. Courchevel luxury ski chalets 2. Go all-inclusive \nTaking this one step further, plumping for an all-inclusive package may seem an expensive initial outlay – but it means holidaymakers spend virtually nothing during their stay. \nAll-inclusive specialist Club Med ( clubmed.co.uk ) offers holidays with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. Included in the price are flights, transfers, full-board accommodation, drinks, lift pass, equipment hire, ski school and even extras such as off-piste guiding. Club Med holidays come with everything included \nAs this year’s prices have already been set – many tour operators purchased their euros and negotiated contracts in advance so the exchange rate should not have a negative impact on the cost of holidays this season – going all-inclusive means British skiers and snowboarders will be largely sheltered from the falling pound when in resort. 3. Embrace the packed lunch \nOne of the most notoriously expensive extras once on holiday is buying lunch up the mountain – particularly if you’re staying in a pricey Alpine resort. Rather than stumping up €20 for a burger and chips every day, buy sandwich ingredients and snacks in the local supermarket and do it yourself. \nHowever, eating a home-made baguette while sitting in the snow and shivering is a miserable experience, so look out for resorts that have picnic rooms designed for thrifty skiers to enjoy their lunch in the warm and dry. The French resort of Val d’Isère , which isn’t known for having the cheapest on-slope eateries, has a brand new picnic area for the 2016/17 season that even has microwaves. 10 of the best snacks for the ski slopes 4. Be currency savvy \nBuying currency at the airport is an absolute no-no; you’ll end up getting the very worst exchange rate. Also avoid using a credit card abroad, as you frequently get stung with a hefty charge. Pre-loading a card with your currency of choice can save money on bank fees and ensure a more favourable exchange rate. The RevolutCard, for example, allows travellers to spend in shops or online without a charge, plus, whether getting money out of a cash machine or using the card to pay, it automatically converts money into the local currency at the best available rate.

Swap the Alps for… \n… Eastern Europe , Andorra, Spain – take your pick. One of the best ways to save money is to forget Alpine mega-resorts and head somewhere lesser known, both in terms of holiday cost and in-resort prices. Eastern Europe has seen huge growth as a skiing destination in recent years, particularly Bulgarian resorts such as Bansko , due to the extremely competitive cost of packages there. This is definitely worth considering – however, if you’re an adventurous intermediate or expert skier or snowboarder you may find the terrain limited and frustrating. Choosing the Pyrenees instead, with resorts such as Baqueira-Beret in Spain, the Grandvalira area in Andorra and the Grand Tourmalet area in France, gives access to varied and challenging slopes at a fraction of the cost of a trip to the Alps. Eastern European resorts like Kopaonik are much cheaper than the Alps 6. Don’t pay for a lift pass \nWe’re not suggesting you make a raid on the lift pass office (please don’t do that). Instead, look for packages that include a lift pass in the price. This means you won’t be subject to an unfavourable exchange rate. For example, Crystal Ski ( crystalski.co.uk ) offers holidays to three resorts – Chamrousse and La Clusaz in France and Engelberg in Switzerland – where the lift pass is thrown in alongside accommodation, flights and transfers. 7. Leave it till the last minute \nWhile booking early is rewarded when it comes to saving on ski holidays, so is waiting till just before you go. Tour operators often have incredible deals and offers last minute, because they’d rather fill a room at a reduced rate than lose money by leaving it unoccupied.

Pick Easter over half term \nIt can be tricky for families to save on skiing as they’re constrained by school holiday dates. You could always risk the fine and take your children out of school (a tactic employed by Telegraph Ski and Snowboard editor Henry Druce), but if that’s not your style, choosing the Easter rather than the February half-term holidays can work out cheaper. In particular, the second week of the Easter holidays is looking better value and is quieter – and by considering smaller, lesser-known resorts , you can save money twofold. 9. Get in the driving seat \nLiterally. Heading to the mountains by car can cost less and it has the advantage of allowing you to stuff your car full of food (and, ahem, booze). By booking a self-drive, self-catering holiday you can buy all the sustenance you need for the week, either in the UK or in a hypermarket on the continent, and spend very little in resort. 10. Cut out the middleman \nMany UK holidaymakers go straight to a travel agent or tour operator when booking a ski trip. Few consider looking at the ski resorts’ own websites, which these days are frequently modern in design and intuitive to use, with special English-language versions available. Many resorts offer great-value accommodation plus lift pass packages – all you need to do is book your travel arrangements.
