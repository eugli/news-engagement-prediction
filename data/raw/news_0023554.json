First off, a shoutout to South Carolina legend Devan Downey. I hope you watched this one tonight, Devan. Your Gamecocks might have lost, but Sindarius Thornwell put up the best performance of any Gamecock since you were on campus. \nAlabama (14-9) and South Carolina played the season's first four-overtime game. It was weird, poorly played at times, oddly riveting and something of an indictment on the conference, but no matter. It's February, college hoops season is unpredictable, and you just have to embrace it. Alabama won 90-86, but the game was so much more than a drawn-out ending between two monotonous SEC teams. Remember, South Carolina had the lead in the league coming into this game. Losing this one on its home floor to a Bama team that's way off the bubble, well, it's brutal. \nEven more brutal: No. 19 South Carolina (19-5) shot 3-for-30 in the first half. That is so bad it's mesmerizing. USC had 16 points at the break. \nEven more incredible was that South Carolina came back. And that a game that ended 90-86 was tied at 57 at the end of regulation. It only got to 57 because USC had a 13-3 run, out of the dark night, to get this game to a free session. \nThe win marks the first time since 2004 that Alabama beat a ranked opponent away from home. It took 21 tries in that span. \nThen there's Thornwell. You know a man named Sin's got to be a bad, bad dude. He looked the part on Tuesday night, putting up 44 points and grabbing 21 boards. In doing this, he became just the third player in the past 20 seasons to have at least 40 points and 20 boards in a game, joining Cleveland State 's Norris Cole (2011) and Oklahoma 's Blake Griffin (2009). An all-time performance goes to waste in a loss. \nNot only that, but Thornwell had more made free throws than anyone in SEC history. He sank 25 of 33 attempts, breaking LSU great Pete Maravich's mark of 30, which he accomplished in 1970. Thirty-three foul shots. For one player. What percentage of all basketball games in a given season don't even have a combined 33 free throws? Ten? Fifteen? Higher? \nOr how about this: How many times this season has a team shot more than 33 foul shots in a game? Just a wild game. And this loss will cost South Carolina a seed, no question about it. \nFor Bama, the coach's son -- Avery Johnson Jr. -- had a career-best 23 points. Alabama's bench had 56 points -- while South Carolina's bench had five.
