But an investigation comparing the cost of train journeys on different routes reveals the shocking difference in prices across the network.\nGreat Western Railway is the country's most expensive operator per mile with its service between Bristol and London costing 86p per mile for the 236-mile round trip\nTrain companies have been accused of punishing passengers for travelling on certain busy routes, where fares can average as much as £177 per 200-mile return journey.\nSome quieter routes of the same distance cost just £30 for an anytime return.\nA comparison of 200-mile journeys, calculated by Barry Doe, for Rail magazine, revealed Great Western Railway to be the country’s most expensive operator, closely followed by Virgin Trains West Coast and East Midlands Trains.\nPassengers travelling into London from cities including Bristol, Leicester and Manchester are regularly charged exorbitant fares because the routes are so popular.\nMajor price discrepancies mean some passengers are forced to pay up to 86p per mile while those in other areas pay as little as 16p\nResearch by the Daily Mail found that one of the country’s most expensive routes, the Great Western Railway service between Bristol and London, charges passengers 86p per mile for the 236-mile round trip.\nBut a 190-mile round trip between Leeds and Appleby in Cumbria, works out at only 16p per mile.\nJames MacColl, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said the system required urgent attention. ‘Passengers often find it difficult to know that they’re getting the best deal as differences between ticket prices are confusing,’ he said. ‘We need the whole process of buying a ticket to be made simpler, fairer and cheaper.’\nPassengers travelling to the capital from Leeds and Manchester using Virgin Trains find themselves paying vastly different fares despite the cities being only 45 miles apart. The West Coast service, from Manchester, charges passengers 81p per mile, but the East Coast service from Leeds – despite being further from the destination – is 61p.\nCat Hobbs, director of We Own It, a group that campaigns for the railways to return to public ownership, said: ‘It’s just a postcode lottery on how outrageous the fare is going to be. The difference in prices for similar journeys is incredible.’\nFares expert Mr Doe said: ‘The operators can charge more expensive rates between cities and London because the trains will be busy regardless. Fares are astronomically high at the moment.’\nIn October, the Commons’ transport select committee published a damning report stating that ‘unfairness, complexity and a lack of transparency’ in rail ticketing have been apparent for at least a decade.\nEast Midlands Trains is another expensive operator due to the Leicester to London route being one of the most popular ones\nCrossCountry, Virgin Trains’ East and West Coast services and East Midlands Trains are taking part in the ticketing scheme, which will aim to make ticket vending machines more user-friendly.\nA spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said the price discrepancies were a result of competition.\n‘It’s a sign of operators competing for passengers, and there are different types of passengers in different parts of the country,’ he said.\n‘Pricing per mile was scrapped by British Rail in the 1960s so that fares could be set according to demand, a commercial approach that today’s train companies have built upon, doubling the number of passengers and helping to cut the cost of the railway for taxpayers.’\nA spokesman for Great Western Railway said: ‘Our single walk-up fares compare well with similar distance journeys on other train operators.’\nI was accused of dodging dearer fare by Virgin Trains 'Gestapo' Steve Morrissey (pictured, right) said Virgin Trains staff acted 'like the Gestapo'\nA businessman yesterday accused Virgin Trains of acting ‘like the Gestapo’ after he was accused of using a loophole to buy a cheaper ticket and questioned by police.\nSteve Morrissey, 32, who runs his own software firm, paid £92.20 for a seat on the 7.38am service from Lancaster to London on Tuesday.\nBut when train staff asked to see his ticket, they accused Mr Morrissey of getting on the train at the next stop, in Preston. Although Preston is 25 miles closer to the capital, under the baffling ticket system the fare from there was £356 – almost £264 more.\nThe ticket collector refused to believe he had got on at Lancaster and – in front of a carriage of passengers – accused him of fraud.\nHe was ordered to buy another ticket at full price or face being fined. When Mr Morrissey refused he was met at Euston station by officers from British Transport Police, who took him away for questioning.\nIt was only when police checked CCTV from Lancaster station, which confirmed the father-of-one had got on the train there, that he was eventually freed without charge 30 minutes later.\nTickets from Lancaster and Preston to London are vastly different\nMr Morrissey, who missed an important business meeting in London because of the incident, said: ‘I did nothing wrong, yet they were calling me a liar, saying I’d got on the train at Preston and not Lancaster.\n‘Throughout the journey, I felt like a criminal. It was so embarrassing being accused of fraud in front of a crowded carriage. It was only when the police agreed to look at the CCTV that they saw I really had got on at Lancaster. It feels like some sort of Gestapo [at] Virgin Trains. What an appalling way to treat your customers.’\nMr Morrissey, of Bispham, near Blackpool, gave a running commentary of his ordeal in a series of tweets which he sent to Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson.\nVirgin Trains apologised and offered Mr Morrissey a half price discount on his next trip. A spokesman said: ‘Our teams make sure people have the right ticket to protect the majority of our customers from the actions of a small minority who try to avoid paying.\n‘However, it’s clear that our people made a mistake in this case and we are sorry for Mr Morrissey’s experience.’", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-04T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:06:28.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
