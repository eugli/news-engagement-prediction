(Photo: Nick Oza / The Republic) \nIn a couple of weeks the Phoenix City Council may have to do something politicians would prefer not to do, ever – take a stand.\nThey either will defy President Donald Trump and declare our beautiful desert burg a “sanctuary city,” in the face of Trump’s threat to punish communities that don’t participate in federal immigration enforcement. Or they will back down.\nHowever, no matter what the council does or does not do -- officially -- it won’t matter. Because Phoenix already IS a sanctuary city. As are a number of other cities and towns in Arizona. It’s not politicians who have made that declaration, but Arizona’s faith community. And they’ve been acting on it for decades.\nActing on their conscience for 30 years Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Phoenix-area cities respond to 'Sanctuary' list   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. \nThe topic of so-called “sanctuary cities,’’ identified as such because of policies that impede cooperation with federal immigration officials in an effort to identify and deport people in the United States illegally, gained renewed attention this summer after the murder of a woman in San Francisco killed by an illegal immigrant. Also this summer, officials in Chandler and Mesa were surprised after receiving e-mails questioning why their cities were listed on an Ohio-based web site as sanctuary cities, which is among the top Google search returns for the term “sanctuary cities’’ and claims to have been updated as recently as Sept. 8. The list, contained on a site called Ohio Jobs and Justice Pac, also listed Phoenix and Tucson among Arizona cities. All four disputed the listing, which also differs from information on other sites that are based on information from federal officials.  OJJPAC Fullscreen Chandler was listed on the site based on a 2006 Congressional Research Service Report. A review of 2006 reports by the service found only one related to immigration, which talked about local enforcement policies in general but did not specify any problem with Chandler. Around this same time, Chandler police officials adhered to a policy in place since 1999 whereby they would not ask for the immigration status of minor offenders. That policy was put in place two years after a controversial police and U.S. Border Patrol effort in which Hispanic residents were questioned about their status. The Chandler roundup became a national story that led to legal action against the city based on racial profiling of legal residents. In 2010, Chandler police amended the policy to include questioning minor offenders about their residency status. Chandler Vice Mayor Kevin Hartke this summer disputed the listing with the web site. The city’s objection is noted on the site, but it remains on the list.  Weldon B. Johnson/The Republic Fullscreen Mesa's listing on the Ohio site cites the city's refusal in 2008 to cooperate with Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's enforcement actions against illegal immigrants, which stirred much controversy at the time. The site specifically cites MCSO's arrest of employees of a contracted cleaning company working at Mesa city buildings, which took place after Mesa police declined to investigate complaints about illegal workers, according to the cite. Also during this period, then-Mesa Police Chief George Gascon was publicly at odds with Arpaio over his enforcement tactics, which later were ordered to cease by a federal court because racial profiling had been employed. Mesa City Councilman Dennis Kavanaugh told the Republic Mesa has a working agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) and that contract will be up for renewal next year.  Bettina Hansen/The Republic Fullscreen The Ohio site does not include any notation as to why Phoenix is included on the list. However, Phoenix police officials referred the Republic to its department’s general orders document, which outlines in detail how the agency is to deal with people found to be in the country illegally. The orders specify that the immigration status of any adult or juvenile arrested is to be verified with the U.S. Immigration and Enforcement or Border Patrol. The policy also states that police, when questioning someone, can ask for identification that can help determine their status and also question someone about their status if there is \"reasonable suspicion'' to suspect they may be in the country illegally. However, it also specifies that identifying someone based on their race is not a valid reason to question someone. The Phoenix policy also offers detailed steps police are to follow depending on directives by federal officials. It also states that federal officials will be notified if a person is arrested and booked on state or local charge, but also specifies that police will not hold a detainee for an extended period based solely on a federal civil matter.  Getty Images Fullscreen Tucson’s listing is based on a 2007 newspaper article that reported how Tucson police would refrain from contacting federal immigration officials to respond to schools or churches, after a student at Catalina High School was deported along with his family after they were found to be in the country illegally. Police were called to the school after the teen was found with marijuana. Tucson officials told the Republic the city \"has never declared itself to be a 'sanctuary city,' and the city has no policies, law, ordinances or regulations that prohibit or limit the enforcement of federal immigration law.\" In addition, the city’s policy states that it “will not limit or restrict the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less than the full extent permitted by federal law.\"  Getty Images Fullscreen According to ICE officials in Phoenix, all four cities have been cooperative with the agency in terms of handling detainers issued by the agency against people identified to be in the country illegally. An ICE memo previously had identified only one Arizona community with policies that could be deemed “sanctuary,’’ South Tucson, based on local officials’ insistence that federal officials reimburse the city for the cost of holding individuals for ICE detainers. A separate report issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in October 2014, which identified jurisdictions with policies that would not cooperate with immigration detainers, or would not do so without a court order or under special circumstances, did not include any Arizona jurisdiction.

We became felons and criminals to some, heroes to others. I don't think either label fits. What we are talking about is an individual acting on his conscience.”\nShe was convicted (along with several others) and received a suspended sentence and five years’ probation.\nAll through the intervening years, and particularly over the past five or 10, other faith groups and congregations -- acting on their consciences -- have offered sanctuary to those in need.\nHardliners would label as criminals the refugees being protected and their protectors.\nThey don’t see it that way.\nWill Trump arrest these guys now? A few years back at Shadow Rock United Church of Christ in north Phoenix there was an electric candle in the window with a small sign beneath it that read, “No matter who you are or where you are on life’s journey you are welcome here.”\nIt was the Christmas season and the church was providing sanctuary for a hardworking Guatemalan family man in danger of being deported.\nPastor Ken Heintzelman told me his congregation looked at the situation this way: \"What relationship are you going to have with history? The other piece of it for us is a reminder that the birth narrative of Jesus is really about standing against empire that would chew up our lives and spit us out. So, the birth narrative about humbly, gently, unpretentiously and powerfully loving and trusting in God, well, that's kind of what we're doing.\"\nI suspect that President Trump’s ultimate immigration enforcement battle isn’t going to be with states, counties, or cities (like Phoenix). It’s going to be with priests, nuns, pastors and other people of faith.\nWill he ask local police to arrest such individuals?\nBack in 1986, after the Sanctuary Movement defendants were convicted at trial, someone clipped a sheet of paper to a banner that had been hanging in the group’s headquarters.\nThe banner read, “The truth will set you free.”\nThe attachment added, “Eventually.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T11:19:54.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
