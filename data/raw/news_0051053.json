Article continues below \n\"My preference is always to manage Arsenal and I have shown that,\" Wenger said, as per The Mirror. \n“But I think I am adult enough to analyse the situation. Alex Ferguson has some other interests in life and he was older than I am today.

Maybe I will do four seasons more, maybe less, I don’t know.\" \nIn the meantime, speculation regarding who could replace the 67-year-old at the Emirates has continued to circulate over the last few days. \nThe latest report from The Mirror claims the hierarchy at the club have contrasting opinions on the right person to fill Wenger's shoes. \nMajor shareholder Stan Kroenke would like to see club legend Thierry Henry return as part of a big shake-up in the coaching department. \nThe ex-striker is currently Roberto Martinez's assistant with Belgium but has repeatedly discussed a desire to come back to Arsenal since retiring. \nHenry even reportedly offered to work at the club for free to coach the Under-18's but Wenger denied the request. \nNevertheless, Henry's instalment is far from a foregone conclusion as Arsenal's other big shareholder, Alisher Usmanov would prefer Diego Simeone to take charge of the team. \nThe current Atletico Madrid manager has won plenty of admirers for how he has turned the La Liga side into a formidable team both domestically and in the Champions League. \nDespite Simeone's fantastic record, this could well be a battle Usmanov loses as the other key decision-makers - chairman Sir Chips Keswick, chief executive Ivan Gazidis and the Kroenkes - believe the Argentine's volatile temperament would make it a risky move. \nOutside of Henry and Simeone, Massimiliano Allegri, Thomas Tuchel and Monaco's Leonardo Jardim are thought to be the other names on Arsenal's shortlist. \nFor now, Wenger will need to re-focus his side to avoid a giant cup upset at non-league Sutton United in their FA Cup clash on Monday. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
