Man proposes to girlfriend with beautiful poem tattooed on his shoulder \nBut his mum Sarah Allen, 36, claims photos of Jasper’s infected chickenpox sores – which covered every inch of his body – have since been stolen. \nThe pictures have racked up millions of shares alongside claims he has cancer and needs money for surgery. \nMs Allen, from St Neots, Cambs, alleges she has reported the photos to Facebook 30 times since she spotted them earlier this month – but said they have not been taken down. His photos are being used by scammers (Picture: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock) Facebook scammers are posting the images (Picture: Facebook) \nMarried mum-of-two Sarah, who also has a daughter Poppy, six, with postman husband Keith, 38, said: ‘I first saw and reported the pictures two or three weeks ago. \n‘The photos of Jasper are on Google, but that’s not the point. It’s not the fact they stole the pictures, it’s the fact they’re lying – cancer is not something you should joke about. \n‘I have had friends and family call up thinking Jasper actually has cancer. It is really upsetting and distressing. \n‘I’ve even seen people commenting on the post offering to transfer donations. \n‘I think it is disgusting. They are scammers. They can’t be real human beings, because no person would think this is OK. They are making up lies. \n‘I commented on the post and said “you sick b d, this is my son, he does not have cancer, take these pictures down” and the page liked my comment. \n‘What Jasper went through was awful but it was nothing compared to cancer – that’s why you shouldn’t just throw something like that around. It is not a joke. \n‘Facebook can achieve amazing things, but sometimes it fails you.’ He is healthy and well (Picture: Kate Towers Photography/Mercury Press) \nSarah claims she received a response from the social media giant stating one of the profiles had been taken down. \nBut the post is still visible and has now racked up 1.2 million shares, 239,000 likes and 149,000 comments. Sergeant told he can’t keep police dog after he retires \nShe said: ‘Seeing those photos keep coming up on Facebook is hard – it was a horrible time. And it isn’t just Jasper – they are doing this to people all the time. \n‘Everyone is commenting on the posts saying it is not cancer, it is a little boy with chicken pox. \n‘Facebook need to make the reporting process better and take things like this down straight away. \n‘You can’t even have a breastfeeding photograph on Facebook without it being taken down, but somehow this is fine?’ \nMetro.co.uk has contacted Facebook for comment.
