Posted 21 Feb 2017 16:05 Philippine Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay speaks during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (not pictured) in Moscow, Russia, December 5, 2016. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin A \nBORACAY, Philippines: Southeast Asian countries see China's installation of weapons systems in the South China Sea as very unsettling and want to prevent militarization and urge dialogue to stop \"recent developments\" from escalating, the Philippines said on Tuesday. \nForeign ministers of the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) were unanimous in their concern about Beijing's reclamation and militarization of manmade islands, Philippine Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay said. \nYasay did not specify which developments provoked the concern, but said the bloc hoped China and the United States would ensure peace and stability. \n\"The ASEAN members have been unanimous in their expression of concern about what they see as a militarization of the region,\" Yasay told reporters after a ministers' retreat on the Philippine island of Boracay. \nThe Philippines is chairman (chair) of the grouping this year and will host its annual meetings, some of which are joined by outside powers, including China and the United States. \nReferring to China's artificial islands, Yasay added, \"They have noticed, very unsettlingly, that China has installed weapons systems in these facilities that they have established, and they have expressed strong concern about this.\" \nFriction between the United States and China over trade and territory under U.S. President Donald Trump have fuelled worry that the South China Sea could become a flashpoint, with many Southeast Asian economies are (no need are) heavily dependent on both powers. \nChina claims most of the energy-rich waters, through which about US$5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. Neighbours Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims. \nChina on Friday completed war games involving its own aircraft carrier that unnerved neighbours. The U.S. navy on Saturday said its aircraft carrier strike group had begun routine patrols in the South China Sea. \nThree days earlier China warned against that, following an incident in early February when a U.S. Navy P-3 plane and a Chinese military aircraft came close to each other over the South China Sea. \nYasay said ASEAN nations recognised policies under Trump were still \"evolving\" but hoped he would unveil them within the next few months to provide a \"more concrete and clearer picture\", especially regarding China. \n\"We do not know the complete picture of what this foreign policy might be, insofar as its relationship with China is concerned. We're, however, hopeful that the policy that would come out will be positive.\" \nHe also said ASEAN wanted a framework for devising a maritime code of conduct between China and the grouping to be completed by June, and Beijing had shown it was keen for it to be finished. \nAll parties should ensure that the code, which has made little progress since the idea was agreed in 2002, needed to be legally \"binding and enforceable\", Yasay added. \n(Additional reporting by Enrico Dela Cruz and Manolo Serapio Jr; Writing by Martin Petty) - Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:12:30.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
