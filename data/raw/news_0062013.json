(Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP) Callum Borchers Washington Post \nIf it feels like you haven't seen Kellyanne Conway on TV in a while, you are not imagining things. The counselor to President Donald Trump , one of the new administration's most visible faces, was pulled off the air by the White House, CNN's Dylan Byers reported Wednesday afternoon. \nByers added in a tweet that Conway's hiatus was temporary. \n\"Kellyanne Conway now tells me she'll be going on Fox News tonight...\" \nIt has been more than a week since Conway appeared on television - an eternity, by her standard. The White House continued to trot her out after she coined the phrase \"alternative facts,\" cited a \"Bowling Green massacre\" that never happened and promoted Ivanka Trump's products on Fox News, but apparently Trump could not abide statements that undermined the administration's official message.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:27:09.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
