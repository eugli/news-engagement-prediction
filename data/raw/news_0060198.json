Just last year, an Oxford mathematician argued that artificial intelligence should be protected by human rights. \nAnd there's no shortage of sci-fi films and books that show what can go wrong when we treat these machines like they have no rights (hello, A.I. ). \nBut the reality is that we're not even close to dealing with the prospect of robot rights in the future - and that's a real problem. \nAs the Kurzgesagt team explains , most of the existing philosophy of rights is ill-equipped to deal with AI, because it's centred around the question of consciousness. And scientists still can't agree on what consciousness actually is . \nSome researchers think it's a state of matter , like gas or liquid; some say that it's a product of our brains . Others say that it's immaterial . \nBased on this very inconsistent definition, there are neuroscientists out there who think that any sufficiently advanced system can generate consciousness and become self-aware - and based on some tests, that might have already happened . \nSo does that automatically mean that any robot that achieves self-awareness deserves right? \nWell, not exactly, because right now, consciousness only makes us worthy of having rights because it gives us the ability to suffer - to not only feel pain, but be aware of it. \nMost of our rights are set up to avoid pain and suffering according to how we experience them as humans - and it's unlikely robots will experience them in the same way unless we program them to do so. So according to that definition, a robot probably wouldn't deserve rights. \nBut then there are other, less tangible rights - like the right to freedom. Would a robot that can't move mind being trapped in a cage? \nAnd would a robot mind being dismantled if it had no fear of death? Would it mind being insulted if it had no need for self-esteem? \nIt's pretty obvious that things are already getting murky, and we haven't even touched on the idea that AI might one day be able to create their own AI. \nBut perhaps more important to consider - based on humanity's long history of abusing other people and species we think are 'less human' than us - is just how much damage we can do to artificial intelligence, and how to limit it. \nYou don't need to spend long in the history books to know that, throughout civilisation, certain groups have exploited others for their own benefit - and they've never struggled to come up with ideological excuses for that abuse. \nSeeing as a lot of people stand to benefit huge amounts of money and power from keeping robots and AI without rights, the video above argues that it's not unlikely the same thing will happen with robots. \nLast year, Stephen Hawking seemed to agree when he called the history of humanity \" the history of stupidity \" because we can't help but make the same mistakes over and over again. \nSo, do we have enough time up our sleeves to properly consider robot rights and implement them before we get things really wrong? Probably not... but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try anyway. \nCheck out the video above to have your mind-melted by the philosophical and ethical decisions we have coming up. For once, we don't envy our future selves, even if they might eventually get to ride around in flying cars .
