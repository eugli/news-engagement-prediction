We didn't sling mud, we didn't throw temper tantrums, we didn't take the low road. We'll leave that to the opposition.\"\nAs for whether that opposition unites itself, Notley said she isn't concerned about campaigning two years before the next presumed election.\n\"No matter how they sort themselves out, we'll be ready,\" she said. \"And we'll be ready because we know where we stand and we know where they stand.\"\nWhat lies ahead for Alberta's unite-the-right effort?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:58:25.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
