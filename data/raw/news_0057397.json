The new location opened in the Weyerhaeuser Building on Sunday and will not only serve its coffee, but will serve breakfast, lunch and happy hour, including beer and wine. The menu includes some dishes reflecting the co-owner and founder Ali Ghambari 's Persian roots. 5 photos Cherry Street Coffee House co-owner and founder Ali Ghambari with his daughter Laila… more Starting March 3, the Public House also will have an evening menu with rotating cocktails and a weekend brunch with a mimosa menu. \"The public house will propel us into the future,\" said Laila Ghambari , director of coffee at Cherry Street and daughter of the founder. \"The way that my father looks at it – it is also a big marketing opportunity for us.\" For Laila Ghambari , this new restaurant is also a dream years in the making. She worked for her father's company when she was younger and then spent a few years in the specialty coffee industry at places like Stumptown Coffee Roasters and Caffé Ladro before returning to Cherry Street in 2014. Ghambari said she has always wanted to do something new and fresh, brining \"something that was a little bit more European and Australian to the coffee shop vibe.\" \"This has been in my head conceptually for about five years,\" she said, nothing that when the Weyerhaeuser space was identified two years ago, she realized it would lend itself perfectly to her idea. Not only is it one of the city's new prime locations, looking right into Occidental Park, but the 2,000 square-foot space is too large for a traditional Cherry Street Coffee House. The fact that there is a Coffee House two blocks to the right and left of it made the decision a little easier as well, she said. Ghambari said this new concept is the first step in creating a new tier within the Cherry Street brand. She thinks there will definitely be room for more Public Houses as well as small walk-up coffee windows, but she does not have a number in mind. \"We've turned down some spaces because the size was too small or too big,\" she said. \"Now Cherry Street can and expand and grow more with the city.\" Come March 3, the evening hours for the public house will be Sunday through Wednesday until 7 p.m. and Thursday through Saturday until 9 p.m. They will adjust as needed for special occasions – such as game days.
