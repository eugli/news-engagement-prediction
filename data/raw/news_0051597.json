By John Wagner / The Washington Post \nTeenage classical singer Jackie Evancho, one of the first performers to be enlisted for President Donald Trump’s inaugural festivities , took to Twitter Wednesday night to express her dismay with the administration’s revocation of federal protections for transgender students and to request a meeting with the president. \nEvancho has a transgender sister, Juliet, who is part of a federal discrimination lawsuit filed against Pine-Richland School District for its implementation of a “sex-specific” policy requiring students to use restrooms that match the sex they were assigned at birth. \nIn a pair of tweets, Evancho, 16 and from Pine, said she was “obviously disappointed” with the decision “to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide.” \n“U gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration,” Evancho wrote in a second tweet to her more than 83,000 followers. “Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with you 2 talk #transgender rights.” I am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide. #sisterlove — jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 22, 2017 . @realDonaldTrump u gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration. Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #transgender rghts ❤ — jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 23, 2017 \nEarlier Wednesday, Trump’s Education and Justice departments notified the U.S. Supreme Court that the administration is ordering the nation’s public schools to disregard memos the Obama administration issued during the past two years regarding transgender student rights. \nThose memos said that prohibiting transgender students from using restrooms that align with their gender identity violates federal anti-discrimination laws. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said earlier Wednesday that Trump believed the issue was best left to individual states.
