was shown alongside the late Janet Patterson's name Monday 27 February 2017 11:06 GMT Click to followES Entertainment Error: Jan Chapman's photo was used instead of Janet Patterson's at the Oscars ABC \nA photo of a living Australian film producer was mistakenly used during the In Memoriam segment at this year’s Oscars . \nJan Chapman’s picture flashed up on screen as the Academy paid tribute to Australian costume designer Janet Patterson, who passed away last year. \nChapman has said that she was ‘devastated’ by the use of her image in the montage as she was good friends with four-time Oscar nominee Patterson. \n“I was devastated by the use of my image in place of my great friend and long-time collaborator Janet Patterson,” she said. Oh dear. The #Oscars put up what I think is a photo of Jan Chapman, instead of Janet Patterson, for the In Memoriam segment. pic.twitter.com/VbnO7u3HoS — Rhett Bartlett (@dialmformovies) February 27, 2017 #oscars also botched the 'in memoriam' showing a pic of the very much still alive Jan Chapman instead of the late Janet Patterson. I can't. — Ms Gambling (@MsGambling) February 27, 2017 Oops. Did #Oscars just show living producer Jan Chapman in place of deceased costume designer Janet Patterson during In Memoriam?! — Stephen Groenewegen (@swgroenewegen) February 27, 2017 \n“I had urged her agency to check any photograph which might be used and understand that they were told that the Academy had it covered.” \nChapman added: “Janet was a great beauty and four-time Oscar nominee and it is very disappointing that the error was not picked up. \n“I am alive and well and an active producer.” Oscars 2017: Moonlight wins Best Picture Oscar after error \nThe error comes after the embarrassing Best Picture mix-up, which saw La La Land announced as the winner instead of Moonlight. \nOscars administrator Pricewaterhouse Coopers have since apologised for the gaffe, but are yet to offer an explanation.
