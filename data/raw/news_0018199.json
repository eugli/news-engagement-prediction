Source: La Manche tourism \nThe Flamanville nuclear power plant is located on the Cotentin Peninsula in La Manche. \nSenior official Olivier Marmion said the explosion happened outside the nuclear zone of the plant. \n“It is a significant technical event but it is not a nuclear accident,” Mr Marmion told UK media. \nThe plant has been at the centre of recent protests over plans to turn on a third reactor, costing an estimated $14.7 million. \nTwo pressurised water reactors at the site have been operational since the 1980s. \nThe affected reactor has been taken off the grid. \nNews break - February 10 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T13:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:14:40.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
