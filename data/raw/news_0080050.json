But point guard Ricky Rubio has picked up the slack. He’s third on the team with 12.1 PPG in February, close to double his total for the month of November (7.0 PPG). \nThe 2014 Timberwolves team that averaged 110.4 PPG in the month of March was led by Kevin Love (24.1 PPG), Kevin Martin (19.4 PPG), Nikola Pekovic (14.8 PPG) and Corey Brewer (12.2 PPG). \nOTHER NOTES \n— Minnesota performs well in Sacramento. The Wolves are 4-4 in their last eight road battles with the Kings, the best road record for Minnesota against any Western Conference team since 2012-13. \n— While Wiggins broke the franchise’s consecutive 20-point games record, Towns isn’t far behind. The 21-year-old center has scored over 20 points in 14 straight games, good for fifth longest in team history. \n— The connection between Rubio and Towns is growing stronger in their second season playing together. Rubio has tallied 161 assists when he throws the ball Towns’ way, ranking the duo second in the NBA and just seven assists behind the Washington Wizards’ John Wall and Bradley Beal (168). \nStatistics courtesy STATS ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:04:46.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
