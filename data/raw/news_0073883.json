Here's what you need to know about Sony Xperia (2017), including the next Sony Xperia phone release date, specs, price, news and more. \n(Update: 27 February 2017): Sony announced three new smartphones at Mobile World Congress 2017, giving us plenty of Xperia news to chew over. Check out our pages for the Sony Xperia XA1 , the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra , and Sony Xperia XZ Premium . \nWe'll be keeping this page live, and eventually updating it with rumours about the next batch of Sony smartphones, which could launch later this year. \nRead on for the original rumour article. Sony Xperia 2017 News – Five phones coming at MWC 2017, apparently \nWe were underwhelmed with Sony's smartphone efforts last year; the phones were unimpressive, confusingly named, and largely forgettable. Unfortunately, we haven't really seen a killer handset from Sony in years, so there's plenty of pressure on the Japanese tech giant to get it right in 2017. \nThe most recent rumour is that Sony plans to launch five different smartphones at MWC 2017 – that's Barcelona's annual tech tradeshow, which takes place this weekend. The handsets are reportedly called Yoshino , BlancBright , Keyaki , Hinoki , and Mineo , although we wouldn't be surprised if these were just codenames. There's a chance Sony will drop these monikers (if they're even real) for more conventional names like Sony Xperia XZ2 – not as if that's any better, mind. \nIt's the Yoshino that's said to be the top-end device, with rumoured specs including a 4K screen and the new Snapdragon 835 chip. However, with rumours of limited Snapdragon 835 supply and questions over whether 4K displays on phones are warranted, we'd take this leak with a pinch of salt. \nSony Xperia 2017 Release Date: February 27, 2017 (most likely) Sony Xperia 2017 Specs: Flagship rumoured to get 4K screen, SD835 chip Sony Xperia 2017 Price: Anywhere up to £599 for flagship (educated guess) \nRelated: Google I/O 2017 Sony Xperia 2017 Release Date – When are the next Sony Xperia phones out? \nFortunately, it's pretty easy to guess when the next Sony Xperia smartphone will be out. Firstly, let's take a quick look back at previous Sony Xperia flagship launches: \nSony Xperia Z1 – September 4, 2013 (reveal) | September 20, 2013 (release) Sony Xperia Z2 – February 24, 2014 (reveal) | March 24, 2014 (release) Sony Xperia Z3 – September 4, 2014 (reveal) | September 26, 2014 (release) Sony Xperia Z3+ – April 20, 2015 (reveal) | May 26, 2015 (release) Sony Xperia Z5 – September 2, 2015 (reveal) | October 1, 2015 (release) Sony Xperia X Performance – February 22, 2016 (reveal) | 15 June, 2016 (release) Sony Xperia XZ – September 1, 2016 (reveal) | October 6, 2016 (release) \nWhat you’ll notice is that Sony operates on a frankly ludicrous six-month release cycle, which means your phone may have been usurped by a newer model before you’ve even unwrapped it. \nNevertheless, it’s clear that Sony has a habit of releasing phones in the first half of the year, specifically at MWC 2017 – and why should this year be any different? \nSony has already scheduled a press conference at the tradeshow for February 27, with proceedings kicking off at 08:30 in the morning, local time. That’s 07:30 for Brits, and 02:30 for New Yorkers. This press event is the most likely venue for new Sony Xperia phones to be released, so stay tuned to TrustedReviews for the latest from the show. \nUnfortunately, the downside is that we might not see a proper flagship after all: \nIt's believed that Samsung has scooped up all of the Snapdragon 835 chip supply for the early part of this year, leaving other manufacturers in the lurch. If this is the case, Sony might not unveil the flagship 'Yoshino' phone until later in the year. Alternatively, Sony could still make the announcement at MWC, but delay the actual release of the phone until later. Sony Xperia 2017 Specs \nThe good news is that we've already seen specs leaked for all five rumoured phones, courtesy of a previously unheard-of Georgian tech blog . The bad news is that we've got no way to verify whether there's any truth to the following claims, so proceed with due caution: \nSony Xperia Yoshino: This is supposed to be the flagship model of the series, and is tipped to carry a 5.5-inch display with a 4K resolution, as well as Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 835 chipset. Also rumoured to feature is Sony’s own IMX400 image sensor, plus 4GB/6GB of LPDDR4X RAM. \nSony Xperia BlancBright: Then there’s the smaller 5-inch ‘BlancBright’, which is said to have a WQHD display and a Snapdragon 653 on board, as well as 4GB of RAM and an IMX400 image sensor. \nSony Xperia Keyaki: Next up is the ‘Keyaki’ with its claimed 5.2-inch FHD display, Helio P20 chip, and 4GB of RAM. There’s also 64GB of storage, plus two cameras – 23-megapixel and 16-megapixel – rumoured. \nSony Xperia Hinoki: The ‘Hinoki’ is another 5-incher, but with a Helio P20 chipset built by MediaTek. This phone reportedly carries 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and two cameras: 16-megapixels and 8-megapixels. \nSony Xperia Mineo: Finally, there’s the ‘Mineo’, which comes without any listed specs. But the site reports that it will cost $350 USD – so that means it’s probably a mid-ranger. Sony Xperia 2017 Images \nLeaked images are in short supply, but we've seen the following set of four images on China's Weibo social media site. They purportedly depict the flagship Yoshino device, but we can't verify the snaps – due caution advised: Sony Xperia 2017 Price \nIt's tough to talk about Sony Xperia pricing for future phones. That's because pricing has varied wildly on flagship phones, and we're also not entirely sure whether we'll even see any Sony flagships in the short-term. There's a good chance that several of the phones we're expecting to launch later this month will be mid-range or low-end, which makes it very difficult to predict the potential price points. \nTo help (if only a little), here are the launch prices for previous Sony flagships in the UK: \nSony Xperia Z2 – £569 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:32:29.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
