British media reported the cause as heart failure. \nFingleton was recognized by Guinness World Records in 2007 as the U.K.'s tallest man. \nBorn in northeast England in 1980, Fingleton told the Guinness records website in 2006 that \"I have always been taller than everyone since I can remember.\" \nHis height made him a basketball natural, and Fingleton played college basketball in the United States for the University of North Carolina and the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. \nHe went on to a short professional basketball career in the U.S. and Europe before turning to acting. \nHe appeared in films including \"417 Ronin\" and \"X-Men: First Class\" and in TV shows including \"Doctor Who\" and the hit fantasy series \"Game of Thrones.\" \nIn the \"Games of Thrones\" the fearsome Mag was a giant on the northern side of the great ice wall that was guarded by Lord Commander Jon Snow and the black-clad men of the Night's Watch. \nCopyright 2017 by The Associated Press.
