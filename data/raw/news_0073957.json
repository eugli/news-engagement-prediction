It lends a sense of continuity to our history.\nIn 1946, when he was seven, he set the pattern, asking the Chicago businessman who more or less owned his Quebec hometown what song he’d like and getting paid to sing it.\nForty years later, when Ronald Reagan visited, Canadians felt as most do now about Trump, but Mulroney embraced him and they sang together holding hands as Canadians cringed from sea to sea.\nIn 1993, his government received the worst election rejection ever, winning just two seats. He’d resigned beforehand but we punished him anyway.\n Twenty years later he introduced himself to a new generation as the ex PM who took hundreds of thousands in cash in paper bags in hotel rooms from a sleazy wheeler-dealer. He never really explained it, or returned the million he got from a Liberal government 10 years before for claiming they’d libeled him by saying he’d done exactly what it now appeared he did. How do you even appear in public after that? No problem!\nBrian Mulroney with Ronald Reagan ahead of the so-called Shamrock Summit in Quebec City on March 17, 1985. ( Jeff Goode / Toronto Star file photo ) Then last week in Florida he sang for Trump, who got elected by promising to kill the same free trade deal Mulroney signed with Reagan 30 years ago. He even sang the same song!\nHe’s the eternal fountain of Canadian shamelessness and I confess: I’d almost miss him if he weren’t.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:38:00.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
