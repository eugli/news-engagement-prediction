(Source: Royal Malaysian Police handout) \nThe four suspects who fled Malaysia through KLIA are Ri Ji-hyon, 33; Hong Song-hac, 34; O Jong-gil, 55 and Ri Jae-nam, 57. They are believed to have planned and executed the murder of Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. \nThey also allegedly recruited the two women who accosted the elder Kim at the low-cost Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA 2) where he had been about to catch a flight back to Macau where he lived in exile. \nThe women allegedly wiped Kim's face with a toxic substance. He died a short while later. \nIt is not clear whether the four North Korean suspects were at KLIA 2 at the time of the attack. \nThey fled Malaysia the same day, escaping via Jakarta, Dubai and Vladivostok before arriving in Pyongyang on Feb 17.

(Screen capture: CCTV footage) \nIn a media conference on Wednesday (Feb 22), Malaysian Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said that authorities have called on the North Korean embassy to compel the two men to come forward to assist with investigations. \n\"We have written to the ambassador to allow us to interview both of them. We hope that the Korean embassy will cooperate with us and allow us to interview them quickly. If not, we will compel them to come to us,\" Khalid told reporters. \nMalaysian police have also asked the North Korean embassy to help trace the four suspects in Pyongyang and hand them over. \n\"We have been very fair in investigation and they should assist us,\" said Khalid. \nSeparately, he disclosed that someone had tried to break into the mortuary at Kuala Lumpur Hospital, where Kim’s body is being kept. He said security has since been stepped up as a precautionary measure to prevent the body from being tampered with. \nKhalid declined to give further details, but the senior police source told Channel NewsAsia that it was a reporter who tried to break into the mortuary. \n\"He was trying to get an exclusive story,\" the source said. - CNA/ac ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:03:19.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
