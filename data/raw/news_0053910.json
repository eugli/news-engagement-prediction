So we thought, ‘why not have people track their steps, bring that logbook into their doctor, discuss what the goals could be and then have it formalized as a written step-count prescription.”\nAlthough the researchers were hoping to see participants increase by 3,000 per day, she said they were still pleased with the results. “We need many little factors to increase our activity levels, so this is one of them,” she said.\nThe beauty of it, Dasgupta said is that patients who step-count have the opportunity to watch the results in real-time, “because you have the monitor on, so you’re actually counting the steps.\n“So if you’re up in your office and you notice by 10 (a.m.) that you haven’t done much, you can get up and walk up and down the hallway a couple of times,” Dasgupta added. “It makes everything count.”\nNow that the results of the study have been published, Dasgupta said she’s hoping the doctor-prescribed step-counting will be added to medical guidelines and awareness campaigns.\n“The basic message is, we’d like to see this out in practice,” she said. “People should ask their doctors about it and discuss whether goal-setting together and a prescription could work for them, and we’re hoping physicians increasingly will think about prescribing step counts.”\nRelated Stories Testing wearable sensors as 'check engine' light for health Fitness trackers 2016: The year's most innovative releases", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:12:28.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
