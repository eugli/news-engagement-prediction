Here’s a look at the violent ways of the ABVP on campuses: \nJai Narain Vyas University (JNVU), Jodhpur (Rajasthan) \nEarlier this month, a case was registered against JNU professor Nivedita Menon for reportedly saying that India’s claim over Kashmir was false, that soldiers join army for livelihood not patriotism. This evoked a violent protest from the ABVP. \nThe university suspended professor Rajshree Ranawat for inviting Menon for the February 3 function. Vice-chancellor RP Singh also hinted that her services could be terminated after the inquiry committee submits its report.

If there is aggression from the Leftists we will counter it in a fitting manner”. \nUniversity of Hyderabad (Telangana) \nIn August 2015, ABVP activists clashed with students affiliated to Ambedkar Students Union in the University of Hyderabad campus following the latter taking out a rally against hanging of Mumbai bomb blast accused Yakub Menon. \nThe incident led to the suspension of five Dalit research scholars and became a national issue when Rohith Vemula committed suicide in his hostel room in January last year. \nABVP activists continued with their aggression in the name of ‘anti-national forces’ and attacked research scholar Amol Singh (25) from Patiala in Punjab for attending a meeting to express solidarity with Kashmiri youth injured by pellets. \nNo ABVP member has been arrested for any of these assaults.

But, the university suspended Bhattacharji who had invited him. Her suspension was later revoked. \n(With inputs from Salik Ahmed in Jaipur, Srinivasa Rao in Hyderabad, Sanjoy Dey in Ranchi, Hardik Anand in Rohtak, and Avijit Ghoshal in Kolkata) tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:31:45.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
