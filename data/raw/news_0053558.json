It's day to day where people are not replaced. [Horizon and Vitalité] are trying to get by with the minimum amount of staff and those staff are being pulled in all different directions,\" she said.\n\"It's most unfortunate because what this report does is it points the finger to say that people aren't doing their job, when in actual fact they are, there just aren't enough people to do it.\"\nHospital cleaning is not a service that should be cut, stressed Robinson, given the risk of antibiotic–resistant superbugs, such as Methicillin–resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] and Clostridium difficile [C. difficile].\nShe has previously predicted \"deaths from hospital-based infections\" if the province goes through with plans to privatize.\nIn a brief submitted to Boudreau in July 2015, CUPE alleged the reputation of the so-called \"Big Three\" private companies — Sodexo of France, Aramark of the United States and Compass Group of the United Kingdom — is \"consistently substandard\" when it comes to hospital cleanliness.\n'Bound to be incidents' Health Minister Victor Boudreau contends hospital cleanliness will improve through privatization of environmental services. (Radio-Canada)\nThe health minister, however, expressed confidence in the government's plan to outsource to Sodexo.\n\"When you're dealing with a company that serves 75 million patients daily around the world, there are bound to be incidents, but you have to measure those incidents versus the success of the company,\" said Boudreau.\nSodexo operates in more than 80 countries around the world, including about 500 sites in Canada.\n'We believe they can improve the level and quality of service provided to New Brunswickers while they're patients in our hospitals and save money at the same time.' - Victor Boudreau, health minister \"They are experts in the business; it's what they do,\" he said.\n\"We believe they can improve the level and quality of service provided to New Brunswickers while they're patients in our hospitals and save money at the same time.\"\nThe contract the Liberals are negotiating with Sodexo will guarantee reduced costs of at least $7.9 million, Boudreau has said.\n\"And that's money that can be reinvested into the system … So you know, we feel this is the right decision for the health care system.\"\nCUPE has said privatization could see 280 jobs cut. Boudreau has acknowledged there would be some job losses when the contract is signed, but has not estimated how many.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:35:31.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
