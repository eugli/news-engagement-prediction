The zoo says that team used ultrasound equipment to help place a lifesaving IV catheter in Fiona’s leg. \nFiona is the first Nile hippo born at the zoo in 75 years. She was born Jan. 24 at 29 pounds, well below the usual. She’s nearing 50 pounds now. \nZoo staffers have monitored her around-the-clock, providing bottle feedings and activities to help her grow and get stronger. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
