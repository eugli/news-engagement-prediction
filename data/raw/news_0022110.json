There must have been many more!\" wrote another. Blood-selling \nCases of HIV/Aids rose sharply in China after a major scandal in Henan province in the 1990s, when farmers who sold their blood contracted HIV through poor safety practises. \nDonors' collected blood was pooled together and the lucrative plasma removed. The remaining blood, now cross-contaminated, was then injected back into the donors so they could donate again soon. \nFor years officials tried to cover up the problem and it is still not clear how many were infected. China said in 2001 that between 30,000 and 50,000 people had contracted HIV through the blood-selling scandal, but other officials have since suggested the figure was much higher. \nThe scandal did help highlight the ways in which HIV could be passed, and rules surrounding blood donation and transfusions have since improved, but illegal practises remain. \nIn 2006, a group of 19 people sued a hospital in Heilongjiang over transfusions from which they contracted HIV. \nIn a recent report , China said it had 501,000 reported cases of HIV/Aids by the end of 2014. It gave no estimate of unreported cases. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T16:58:01.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
