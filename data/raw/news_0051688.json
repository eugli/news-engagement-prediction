The one we sent to press was not like this,” said Tinu when asked about the gaffe. \n“Our workers pasted it without checking it. It is not appropriate at Language Martyrs Day. We will remove it,” he added. The poster mentioned Tinu as a close associate of Minister Nurul Islam.\nNot only this poster, a banner produced on behalf of Ward No 21 AL leader Firoz Patwary and hung near Askerdighi kitchen market reads: “How can we forget the martyrs day – 21st February we achieved by the sacrifice of the ‘honour’ of thousands of mothers and sisters.\" \nIt also says “long live martyrs’ day.” \nThe banner is also carrying the pictures of Bangabandhu, Hasina, Joy and Firoz Patwary. \nIn small print, the banner mentions the names of Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Teressa and addresses Hasina as mother. \nFiroz Patwary was unavailable for comment. \nWhen contacted about distorted and inaccurate information in the poster and banner, Chittagong city Jubo League Convener Mohiuddin Bacchu told bdnews24.com, “When we started student politics, our elders used to take classes about the political history of the country.” \n“We tried our best to impart similar lessons to our activists – about politics, economics, society, culture and history. But we haven't had much success,” he added. \nA Bangla Department professor of Chittagong University, Dr Mohammad Mohibul Aziz, told bdnews24.com that “when you are ignorant about true history, you make this kind of mistake\". \n\"The government should take the initiative to make proper history on the Language Movement and Liberation War available and accessible to the grass roots to end this situation,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:59:00.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
