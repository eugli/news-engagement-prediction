'I made the video to encourage people to talk about their insecurities, everyone has something they don't want others to see. 'From acne to scars to birthmarks, there are lots of things people feel insecure about, really people should see it as something that makes them unique. 'Skin tells a story about yourself, so if you have a 'flaw' you should think of it as something interesting and positive. As a young baby, the 25-year-old underwent two operations to try and minimise the look of the birthmark, which is caused by abnormally widened blood vessels Playground bullies told Leroy that she wouldn't be liked because of the mark on her face. She says she now hopes to inspire other young children; the condition 3 in 1,000 'It tells your story rather than being something negative and that you're broken. I think this video is trying to make it more open and less ashamed.' Celina's parents Emilia and Billy Leroy, a US TV personality, started laser treatment to reduce the appearance of their daughter's birthmark when she was only one. She continued treatment into her teens, after worrying it would affect her dreams of becoming an actress. Celina said: 'As a young girl I was more insecure about my port wine stain, in your head you over-analyse things, but as you get older you realise how you look isn't the only thing that matters. She continues: 'Since then I've been able to deal with it better. I'm hoping my video will help little kids with birthmarks; they can show other kids the footage and realise they don't have to feel alone.' While growing up Celina faced teasing herself, with bullies at school telling her she wouldn't be liked because of her birthmark. The upbeat video encourages people to express themselves, with Leroy saying: 'You'll realise people are actually really supportive and will support you' Dr. Linda Rozell-Shannon, President and Founder of the Vascular Birthmark Foundation (VBF) says: 'For first ten years of our organisation's 22-year history, we promoted early intervention and aggressive treatment of vascular birthmarks, such as Celina's port wine stain.' Celina added: 'I've had some cruel comments over the years, when I was in school a girl told me I was pretty but because I had a birthmark I would never be popular. 'When I was a lot younger I used to get really upset and question why I had to have a port wine stain, which made me very self-conscious and gave me a low self-esteem in front of people. 'Even now a lot of little kids ask me what I have on my face, but a lot of other people used to just stare - if people asked me I'd be only too happy to tell them it's a birthmark.' Celina Leroy 'Even now a lot of little kids ask me what I have on my face, but a lot of other people used to just stare - if people asked me I'd be only too happy to tell them it's a birthmark.' The Vascular Birthmark Foundation (VBF), which offers advice and support, say their policy for treatments for birthmarks has changed over the years. While Leroy's lesion will progress in time and require further treatment to stop it becoming problematic, the VBF are fully supportive of her decision to stop concealing the port wine stain Leroy says she plans to continue filming for a project called 'Flaw-some Beauty in Birthmarks' Dr. Linda Rozell-Shannon, President and Founder of the VBF said: 'For first ten years of our organisation's 22-year history, we promoted early intervention and aggressive treatment of vascular birthmarks, such as Celina's port wine stain. 'It wasn't until I realised that many adults were choosing to live with their birthmark that I actually revised our mission statement to include that we support programs that promote acceptance for individuals with birthmarks. 'While we want it to be clear that a port wine stain is a progressive lesion, and Celina's will thicken in time, and it should be treated so that it does not become problematic. 'However, we are 100% in support of accepting that a vascular birthmark is as much a part of the individual as is the colour of their eyes.' The organisation has launched a campaign called 'VBF Ask/Accept' to help reduce the stigma of birthmarks by educating the public. Dr. Rozell-Shannon added: 'We want people living with a port wine stain, like Celina, to be able to educate others that this is a progressive vascular anomaly that is considered a birth defect and like any other difference. 'It should be accepted and no one should be judged because of it. No one asks to be born with a birth defect. 'That's why VBF is committed to our annual campaign to raise awareness and remove the stigma.'
