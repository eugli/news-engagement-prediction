But he’s been back in the spotlight as the Falcons rose up to the game’s biggest stage, and he spoke to Sports Illustrated this week about why he’s “ready to move forward in life.” \n“I’m kind of looking at life from a different perspective now. I’ve got kids growing that I’ve got to be there for. I was committed in 2016 to giving it one more shot. I’m very content with my career and what I’ve been able to accomplish. I accomplished more than I ever thought I would,” Vick told SI’s Jonathan Jones . “Listen, at the end of the day, through all the downs I played, I can say I won a game for every team that I played for, even though I only made three starts in New York and three starts in Pittsburgh. I made a difference, I’m content with my career and I’m ready to move forward in life.” \nTo celebrate his career, let’s look back at his five most amazing plays. Even more amazing when you consider that a couple of them came after he served almost two years in prison in the middle of his career. But on to the highlights: Possibly the most dynamic player in NFL History… \nThe Top 5 Plays of @MikeVick 's Career! https://t.co/ok4h4aighk \n— NFL (@NFL) February 4, 2017 \nVick, selected by Atlanta with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2001 draft, passed for 22,464 yards and 133 touchdowns with the Falcons, Eagles, Jets and Steelers.
