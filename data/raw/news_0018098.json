Jack Adcock suffered a cardiac arrest at Leicester Royal Infirmary after staff failed to diagnose him correctly. A doctor and a nurse at the hospital received suspended sentences for gross negligence manslaughter over the tragedy in 2011. Since then, the trust has been ordered by the Care Quality Commission watchdog to improve its handling of sepsis. The potentially fatal condition is a serious complication of an infection and kills about 37,000 patients a year in England. The Daily Mail launched its End the Sepsis Scandal campaign last year to raise awareness after 12-month-old William Mead, from Cornwall, died from the condition. An investigation found medics and NHS 111 helpline staff missed chances to save him.
