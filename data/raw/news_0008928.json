I had a wicked time in house but I've got loads on in my personal life – I've got my kids, I've got lots of work coming up. We're just going to be friends.\" Jamie spotted after the CBB finale on Friday (Photo: FameFlynet) \nJamie, 30, also opened up about his regrets, saying he'd made plenty of mistakes when he was younger. \n\"I made loads of mistakes and I look back and think, what an idiot. Things I've tweeted, what an idiot,\" he said. \n\"I came from nothing and suddenly I had everything I'd ever dreamed of – I was always going to make mistakes because I was young.\" \nThe footballer said that while he'd enjoyed his CBB stint, he also had problems with Kim Woodburn, who has since tweeted that his and Bianca's romance \"was all for show\". Jamie had called Bianca \"wifey material\" in his exit interview (Photo: Channel 5) \n\"It was hard work [living with Kim],\" he confessed. \"She came in all guns blazing – I didn't know what was going on.\" \nAsked whether her anger could've all been a ploy for airtime, Jamie disagreed. \n\"I saw her on TV yesterday and she was exactly the same,\" he pointed out. \n\"She came out and was in all these memes, she was going viral. Living with her was hard work.\" Kim clashed with Phillip Schofield on Monday's This Morning (Photo: Rex Features) \nHe went on: \"She called me an adulterer. She came for me massively. I think she was going to fight me – she would've knocked me out!\" \nIt came after Bianca lashed out at Jamie after finding out he'd dumped her over the internet. \nThe glamour model, 30, hadn't heard from Jamie that he was having doubts over their relationship until she read that he was once again a single man who wanted to focus on his family. \nIn a statement, Bianca said: \"I totally respect his decision, obviously children should always come first. \n\"[But] it would have been more respectful to hear the news from him first rather than reading about it in the newspapers.\" Bianca hadn't even heard Jamie wanted to be single (Photo: FameFlynet UK) \nAn insider close to the close had said Jamie wanted to remain friends with his CBB love interest, but it appears Bianca was left totally in the dark about his intentions. \nFollowing a week of letting his hair down at strip clubs and top hotspots, Jamie revealed he's not actually into pursuing a romance with Bianca. \nAn insider told The Sun : \"They are going to remain firm friends but Jamie needs to spend time with his family first and focus on other things in his life. \n\"They had a great time in the CBB house but unfortunately it has come to an end.\" Jamie and Bianca have split (Photo: Channel 5) \nThe shock split will only fan rumours that their loved up display in the CBB house was nothing but a showmance – a claim Jamie took exception to when Calum Best mentioned it during a chat with Nicola McLean. \nAnd despite Jamie saying Bianca was \"wifey material\" in his exit interview, it looks like he had a change of heart in the days following the CBB final. \nNeither Jamie nor Bianca have publicly confirmed their split – in fact, they seem to have not even referred to each other since coming out of the house. \nThe only small acknowledgment Bianca had of her CBB romance was when a fan asked what she'd been up to since Friday's final and whether she'd seen Jamie yet. Bianca and Jamie looked cosy after the CBB final (Photo: FameFlynet) But Jamie is said to want to focus on his family (Photo: FameFlynet) \nBianca replied: \"Oh thanks babe just been super busy since I've been out the house I do miss it a little bit xx.\" \nAs the news broke, some were less shocked than others. \nThe couple's CBB housemate Kim Woodburn was typically forthcoming with her opinion, telling her Twitter followers: \"It was all for show my love!\" \nJust yesterday in an interview with OK! magazine, the former footballer revealed that he could see a future with the model. \n\"She definitely has that potential [to be The One],\" he admitted. \"She's an amazing girl. I know she has her situation to sort out on the outside and I need to respect that.\" Jamie spotted with his fellow housemates at the CBB finale (Photo: FameFlynet) He and Bianca were reunited five days after he was booted out of the show (Photo: FameFlynet) \nIt comes after the ex-housemate went out partying several times in the days since leaving the house, including last night when he went to see Drake at the O2. \nJamie ended up at London nightclub Libertine after watching the rapper's performance and partied the night away until the small hours – as documented on his Snapchat. \nBut there was no sign of his CBB love interest, despite Jamie telling OK! that he wants her in his life. \nHe went on: \"Whatever she wants to do, I'm happy with, but she is definitely someone that I want to have in my life. She said to be that she really likes me and she wants something between us, so I'd like that as well.\" Bianca is once again single after being dumped by Jamie (Photo: Channel 5) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T18:24:57.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
