Perhaps the police will call Umno Sungai Besar chief Jamal Mohd Yunos for questioning. Then arrest him and get a remand order. Then release him on bail. \nThe attorney-general (AG) will never charge him in court because Jamal is above the law. It has become disgusting and an affront to the rule of law. \nIf Mohamed Apandi Ali cannot charge Jamal in court, just step down as AG. If the law can be bent backwards for Jamal, why bother with the law? Are we a nation of laws or a nation of thugs and gangsters? \nIf even a fraction of these things were done to PM Najib Razak, the IGP (inspector-general of police) and AG would be jumping up and down. But it’s open season when it comes to the Selangor MB. \nIf Umno cannot respect the will of the Selangor people, why bother with elections? \nPolitician: Two weeks ago, I wrote to ask the PM if he will hand over power to the winner of the next election when BN losses. It is not just me who wants to know, but the whole of Malaysia. \nI am sure agent provocateurs like Jamal and others will be used to stir problem and declare an emergency so that BN can stay in power forever. \nHere, we have a henchman like Jamal carrying a coffin in what looks like a real ‘kereta jenazah’ (hearsh). \nIf these vehicles were government-owned, then the respective agency must be reprimanded. This is abuse of government property for a cause it was not meant for. \nAnonymous S303: Yes, this is a blatant abuse of a hearse. These are the hideous conduct by lunatics who go to the length of disrespecting their own faith, much to the embarrassment of majority of the faith. \nVijay47: If Umno is thinking of recapturing Selangor, they have dug their own grave using this clown as their grave digger. \nJamal's antics remind me of the movie ‘Dead Man Walking’. Maybe in his case, he knows that the end is nigh. What a deprived insecure childhood he must have come from for him to indulge in such attention-seeking activities solely to catch the public eye. \nI have heard of “digging your own grave”, but this is the first time I have come across someone bringing his “coffin” to complete the funeral set. \nFerdtan: Don’t stop Jamal doing what he unwittingly does best with his antics. \nAnd don’t underestimate the intelligence of Malaysians, especially the Malays whom he was naively targeting. He is one-man machine that will bring more ridicule to Umno. \nWith Jamal causing harm to Umno, Pakatan should be laughing all the way to the next election. \nMaplesyrup: Jamal, if you have the evidence, cut the drama - just lodge a report, pass the evidence to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and let it do its work. \nYou obviously have no love for Selangor Azmin Ali or PKR, so it seems ludicrous that you appear to be “giving a chance” to Azmin. Be a ‘jantan’ (man) and do the right thing. \nMosquitobrain: Umno will reign supreme and standing tall if all its members are as \"hardworking\" like Jamal. \nHe is a multitasker - a resort operator (illegal one-night-stand motel), Bersih 5 outriders, 'red' painters, alleged thief (gang robbery, according to the police), ice cream seller, and now a grave digger. \nSmall wonder Umno warlords, members and even law enforcers are proud of him. Clearly, he is a role model for other Muslims. \nGoldee: Selangor Umno chief Nor Omar, the opposition MPs needed this clown to continue with his job until GE14. \nA true Muslim would never do such thing to bring a coffin to humiliate another Muslim. This is unbecoming of a Muslim and his behaviour is a disgrace not only to Muslims but Malaysians in general. \nAnonymous #44199885: I hope Malaysian Official 1 (MO1) will appoint him to the cabinet as he at least is honest in expressing his stupidity and more deserving of a seat than the other members of the cabinet who continue to lie to the rakyat about 1MDB and the loss of billions of public funds through corruption and money laundering as alleged by US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI. \nJust A Malaysian: When Jamal was detained, we thought Umno had decided to stop his antics, which was embarrassing to his race and religion. \nHow wrong we were. It looks like Jamal is tasked with embarrassing Selangor MB Azmin. Umno has lost all dignity as a ruling party. \nAnonymous 2436471476414726LJ: Surely he has broken some laws. Are the police going to ignore this simply because he is from Umno? I am sure if he is from DAP, PKR or Party Pribumi, the police would have acted swiftly. \nWhat if other citizens are to pull the same act in front of the PM's office in Putrajaya? Would it be tolerated? I don't think so. \nThe Mask: Look, Mr IGP. Jamal said he has apparently quit Umno. So, there is no need to fear of his connections. \nYou can take the necessary action against such a nuisance, as you would have if that person has been from the opposition. \nWe understand your position before Jamal quits, but now it’s different, so do your job according to the law. \nSlumdog: The Umno hero and incorrigible pest is at it again. No brains, no shame. \nA Voice from the Wilderness: Indeed, if Umno is thinking of recapturing Selangor, they have dug their own grave using this clown as their grave digger. \nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers.
