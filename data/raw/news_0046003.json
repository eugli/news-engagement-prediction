This seems like a great idea. It might get people more involved in their communities if they can't fit a three-metre big screen in their house.\" \nGill : \"The idea is becoming more and more appealing as I look around at all the 'stuff' we have and use only such a small proportion of.\" \nJanelle : \"Not everyone wants a four-bedroom, two-bathroom, two-garage, media room and everything else. Builders need to look beyond this.\" \nBut others felt micro-blocks would be just too small and were not necessary in a city like Perth. \nTolla : \"No way. People need space. Children need areas to run free and teenagers and young adults need their own areas. We live in this wide brown land so let us enjoy it.\" \nBelle : \"Tiny house? Yes. On a tiny block? No. You need some outdoor space to compensate for the tight living quarters.\" \nLin : \"I worry about privacy and noise issues living so close [together].\" Avoiding the neighbours \nThe micro-block concept could be a boon for people who want to downsize but dislike the idea of apartment living and shared spaces. \n\"Some people don't want to move into an apartment or a unit development with strata fees and common or shared spaces,\" Ms Hailes said. \nResearch by Curtin University's Department of Urban and Regional Planning found that while people accept the idea that Perth needs high-density housing, many dislike the idea of living in apartments . \nResearcher Shohreh Nematollahi surveyed residents in Perth's southern suburbs and found they wanted to keep to themselves and had an aversion to the prospect of unexpectedly running into neighbours in the corridor, garden or other common areas. \n\"They were prepared to have very narrow houses, perhaps with just three or four metres frontage, as long as they are not sharing with other people,\" she said. \n\"That's a big concept for an architect, to make high-density housing without any shared space.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:34:50.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
