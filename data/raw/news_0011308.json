She also said she did not fully explain the consent form. Leona said: 'She knelt down at the side of me and injected me from one angle on the left-hand side. She stabbed into my mouth all in one shot. It was over in two seconds, I've never experienced pain like it. Swollen: Leona's lips after the procedure 'My mouth and lips were pumping out blood and I was panicking, I was told \"don't worry it's normal for it to do that\", and then she left.' Miss Omalley said she was left in pain following the treatment. 'My face started going tight and my eyes were swelling up,' she said. 'My mouth swelled up so badly I couldnâ€™t speak or have a drink.' Hospital medics prescribed steroids which reduced the swelling but Miss Omalley insisted her lips have not yet returned to their normal size. 'I cried and couldn't look in the mirror,' she said. 'I went to take a selfie and put my camera on, when I looked at myself and just thought \"what have I done?\" I was heartbroken.' Miss Omalley said her five-year-old daughter Lily was 'traumatised' by the incident and that she couldn't let her other children, 18-month-old Nellie and seven-month-old Tommy, near her mouth. She added: 'When my mum saw me she was heaving and being sick. My dad was really upset too. My boyfriend Gareth was really worried about me. He's always telling me not to do it.' Leona is now urging women to fully research before undergoing the needle. Harley Street cosmetic doctor Dr Dan Dhunna said: 'Cheap is not chic. You don't search for fillers like you would a bargain in the sales. Painful: Miss Omalley said her swollen lips, pictured, were so big she could not eat or drink Traumatic: The mother-of-three, pictured, said her lips scared her young children 'It's all about quality of product, quality of experience and training by a medical practitioner.' The beautician who carried out the procedure strenuously denied the allegations. She said: 'If I turned up with equipment in a carrier bag and didn't have gloves on why would she let me anywhere near her with a needle? 'She also sat and read the consent, why would she sign a document if she had no idea what it was about? It's absolute madness. I did not stab her or inject from one side only, that would have resulted in uneven lips. 'I left the numbing cream on until she was happy they were numb, I used anti-septic wipes on the area and afterwards I handed her a wet wipe for the area to get any little bits of blood from the injection sites. 'Her face didn't swell, just her lips - none of it is true.'
