We’re back! And we’re back with yet another finely poised, intriguing, impossible to predict (and we’re at risk of overusing those adjectives). Scotland v Wales doesn’t immediately spring to mind when thinking about possibly decisive matches in the championship but I’ll be damned if it isn’t one this year. \nAfter weekend one, when Scotland did for Ireland, right here in Edinburgh, you would have made them favourites to beat a Wales side that struggled before putting away Italy. The Scots looked sharp and exciting, they were well marshalled and they were excellent the breakdown against Ireland’s much-vaunted back row. Wales, on the other hand, were underwhelming to put it kindly. \nBut what a difference another round and a week off make. Vern Cotter’s team have been gutted through injuries and, in Josh Strauss and Greig Laidlaw, have lost two of the cornerstones of what some had tipped to be a title challenge. Wales, on the other hand, were impressive in the tightest of thrillers against England and showed more verve in defeat than they had in victory. Furthermore, they welcome back George North from injury. \nWith one win and one defeat each thus far, it is impossible to say who the form side is. In terms of talent, you would say that Wales edge it but for the fact that Scotland have the most irrepressible player in the tournament in Stuart Hogg. Dan Biggar continues to hold off Sam Davies in the battle for the red No10 jersey but if he is off his game today then Scotland’s full-back could have a field day. \nKick-off for this one is 2.25pm Edinburgh time, which is 2.25pm Cardiff time or 2.25pm GMT. Here are your teams. \nScotland: Stuart Hogg, Tim Visser, Huw Jones, Alex Dunbar, Tommy Seymour, Finn Russell, Alistair Price; Gordon Reid, Fraser Brown, Zander Fagerson, Richie Gray, Jonny Gray, John Barclay (c), John Hardie, Ryan Wilson. \nReplacements: Allan Dell, Ross Ford, Simon Berghan, Tim Swinson, Hamish Watson, Henry Pyrgos, Duncan Weir, Mark Bennett. \nWales: Leigh Halfpenny, George North, Jonathan Davies, Scott Williams, Liam Williams, Dan Biggar, Rhys Webb, Rob Evans, Ken Owens, Tomas Francis, Jake Ball, Alun Wyn Jones (c), Sam Warburton, Justin Tipuric, Ross Moriarty. \nReplacements: Scott Baldwin, Nicky Smith, Samson Lee, Luke Charteris, Taulupe Faletau, Gareth Davies, Sam Davies, Jamie Roberts.
