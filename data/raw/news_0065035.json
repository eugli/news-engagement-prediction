After experiencing problems turning on the phone, she took it to the Apple Store where employees ran diagnostics and told her nothing seems to be wrong with the handset. \nWhile the iPhone appeared to be functioning properly, things took a turn for the worse on the next morning when it started melting down. \n“I was asleep with my phone charging next to my head, my boyfriend grabbed the phone and put it on the dresser,” the teenager further told Mashable. At some point, the boyfriend saw the “phone steaming and [making] a squealing noise.” \n“By the time he got over to the phone it had already caught fire,” she added. “[H]e quickly grabbed the phone and threw it in the restroom […] [where it] blew up and more smoke started coming out of the phone.” \nOlivas has since handed over the faulty handset to Apple. The company is yet to comment on the issue in more detail, but as of now nothing seems to suggest the flaw is more widespread. \nWhile the Cupertino giant has previously dealt with complaints about unexpected shutdowns and flickering screens on the iPhone 6 , reports about fire-catching Apple devices have been scarce – though not entirely non-existent. \nIn the heat of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 battery disaster , a surfing instructor from Australia claimed his iPhone 7 burst into flames and set his car ablaze . The man said he left his phone wrapped in a pair of pants only to discover his car filled with smoke when he returned. \nUnlike him, though, Olivas claims she did nothing to her device that could’ve chained the meltdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:53:52.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
