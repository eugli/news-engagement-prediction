Here is a smart t-shirt, which is quite affordable, that will not only help you get fit but also navigate your run. tech Updated: Feb 09, 2017 13:44 IST Hindustan Times Broadcast Wearables’ Sygnal t-shirt is waterproof too. \nDon’t we all love having a smart wearable that can help burn those extra calories? Isn’t it great to load music on it and take it for a run? We know the answer. \nBut how about if we tell you that a Hyderabad-based domestic firm has come up with a t-shirt that can become a part of your regular gym/exercise gear? This means nothing to carry but just wear it. \nBroadcast Wearables is working on an actual wearable that weaves textiles and technology together and they call it the Sygnal t-shirt. Priced at Rs 4,999, the t-shirt can count the steps you take, calories burnt, floors climbed and sync with MAPS to help navigate your runs as well. \nRead: Samsung Gear S3 review: Big on battery, iPhone compatible and looks more like a watch \nWondering how does it connect? Obviously, it uses an app (available for both Android and iOS) to connect to your phone and store data related to your fitness inside the app. But if you are thinking that you need to keep looking at the phone while you are running to read through navigation instructions, then you are wrong. \nThe T-shirt has two inbuilt vibration sensors on both shoulders that sense when maps wants you to go right or left and will vibrate accordingly. Additionally, the t-shirt has a magic controller which snugly fits at the back of the t-shirt (near the neck). It’s the nerve centre of the garment that uses Bluetooth to sync with the app and has to be charged once in 3 to 5 days, according to the company. There is also a soft switch on the sleeve (which is like a button) to switch the device on or off. \nRead:Wearable devices need to be more useful: Gartner \nInterestingly, the t-shirt is waterproof making it washable. The company also claims that the t-shirt is trendy enough to be worn at all occasions. \nIf you want to pre-order the t-shirt, then we suggest you order it via Bengaluru-based crowd-funding platform FuelADream which is offering a 50% discount on the product bringing the price down to Rs 2,499 and $59 in contrast to $99 for global shipping. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:54:12.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
