How she can do that much dancing and still sound amazing when she sings. How she can manage to even change her makeup (that bedazzled eye mask she wore at the beginning and then removed) mid-performance. #ladygaga I love you ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹\nA photo posted by Sarah Nicole Tanno (@sarahtannomakeup) on Feb 6, 2017 at 11:10am PST\nI donâ€™t have answers on how she pulled off the first two on the list other than just the fact that she's Gaga, but I do have the breakdown of her super high-maintenance look for the evening. Makeup artist Sarah Tanno created the looks using only Marc Jacobs Beauty for all 23 products, which, as you know if you've ever walked down the MJ aisle at Sephora, aren't exactly cheap. I did some math to save you the effort, and the total came out to a whopping $836 to get the look. Expensive but totally worth it, right? I would expect no less from Gaga. Here's what Tanno used:\nTwinkle Pop Stick Eye Shadow in \"Au Revoir 406,\" $28 Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner in \"Blacquer 42,\" $25 Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner in \"Violet Femme 82,\" $25 About Last Night Style Eye Con No. 20 Eye Shadow Palette, $99 Style Eye Con No. 7 Plush Eye Shadow Palette in \"The Tease 202,\" $59 Style Eye Con No. 7 Plush Eye Shadow Palette in \"The Lover 220,\" $59 Magic Marcâ€™er Precision Pen Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner in \"Blacquer,\" $30 Highliner Matte Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner in \"Pink of Me 59,\" $25 Velvet Noir Major Volume Mascara, $26 Feather Noir Ultra-Skinny Lash Discovering Mascara, $24 Brow Wow Defining Longwear Eyebrow Pencil in \"Dark Brown 8,\" $25 Brow Tamer Grooming Gel, $24 Under(cover) Perfecting Coconut Face Primer, $44 Re(marc)able Full Cover Concealer in \"3 Young,\" $32 Re(marc)able Full Cover Concealer in \"7 bright,\" $32 Genius Gel Super-Charged Oil-Free Foundation in \"44 Golden Medium,\" $48 Remedy Concealer Pen in \"6 After Hours,\" $39 Perfection Powder Featherweight Foundation in \"360 Golden,\" $46 #Instamarc Light Filtering Contour Powder in \"Dream Filter 20,\" $49 Air Blush Soft Glow Duo in \"500 Lush & Libido,\" $42 Lip Lock Moisture Balm, $24 Le Marc Lip CrÃ¨me Lipstick in \"Dashing 206,\" $30 Enamored Hi-Shine Gloss Lip Lacquer Lipgloss in \"332 Hot Hot Hot,\" $28 Game Face: get @LadyGagaâ€™s winning #SB51 makeup look using #MarcJacobsBeauty. â € â € @sarahtannomakeup used #CoconutPrimer, Genius Gel, #InstaMarc Contour Powder, #AirBlush in Lush & Libido, Twinkle Pop Eye Stick in Au Revoir, #Highliner Gel Eye Crayon in Violet Femme + Blacquer, Magic Marcâ€™er Liquid Eyeliner in Blacquer, new Highliner Matte Gel Eye Crayon in Pink Of Me, #VelvetNoir Major Volume Mascara, #LeMarc Lip CrÃ¨me in Dashing + Enamored with Hot Hot Hot.\nA photo posted by Marc Jacobs Beauty (@marcbeauty) on Feb 5, 2017 at 6:06pm PST\nGet non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed.
