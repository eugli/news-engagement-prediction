Saban, being way more hip with the social media than Bill Belichick , had some great things to say about that leadership meeting. \nHe said via Al.com : \n\"I just met with Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook guy,\" Saban said, speaking at the 2016 Crime Stopper of the Year Luncheon held in Hoover. \"He wanted to know about leadership, and what do you do to affect people.\" \nZuckerberg, he said, was aware of the role of football in the state. \"It was kind of interesting that he saw the spirit that we have in this state relative to supporting athletics as something that is very special, very unique, and very wholesome in terms of people having the opportunity to create hope whether it's in competition, or something they believe in or a spirit,\" Saban said. \nIt was still awesome that Saban assumed some people didn't know who Zuckerberg was. The guy only created the world's most popular social media platform - no big deal. \nZuckerberg also enjoyed his meeting with Saban. \nNow, Zuckerberg needs to schedule a meeting with Belichick. That would really be something special .
