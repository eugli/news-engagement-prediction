They got away.\" \nShe said the thieves appear to have stolen some beer, handbags and knives from the woman's kitchen. \n\"It's an awful story â€” it's very hard to comprehend how people could be so callous, especially to an 87-year-old,\" Ms Jorgensen said. \nThe woman's home was broken into on the previous Friday night as well. \nNew police statistics released yesterday in the NT showed the number of house break-ins in the town dropped by 28 per cent last year, while commercial break-ins rose by 34 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:11:43.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
