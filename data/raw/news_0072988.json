Was Connor trying to save his fellow Keating Five member? Or could there have been more nefarious motives at play? \n“One could argue that it looks like Connor is trying to save Wes,” Falahee says. “I think that Connor has definitely been on his toes a little bit around the group since Wes’ death. He’s been acting quite suspicious and throwing a lot of blame around, so I could understand why the audience might think that.” \nHowever, considering Connor’s tendency to spiral into guilt (See: Aftermath of Sam’s death), could it be plausible that Connor actually did kill Wes and immediately regretted it? “Sure, but who kills someone and then is like, ‘You know what? Wait, I’m going to do chest compressions,'” Falahee says. \nStill, it’s quite suspicious that over the course of this season, Connor has not once mentioned interacting with Wes the night of the house fire. “I think he does that because he doesn’t trust [anyone],” Falahee contends. “Regardless of the relationship between — or how Annalise and the kids have tried to be in this together, work together against all of these opposing forces, there’s a lot of distrust, there always has been and I think probably always will be, to a degree.” \nEither way, the upcoming two-hour finale will definitively reveal who’s to blame for Wes’ death. “As a cast, we waited the entire back half of the season to find out who killed Wes,” Falahee says. “We were shocked when we found out; there’s no other way to describe it. It’s not who you would expect.” \nHow to Get Away with Murder ‘s season finale airs Thursday at 9 p.m. ET on ABC.
