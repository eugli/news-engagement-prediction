[Photo/Agencies] \nMUNICH - US Senator John McCain,defending the media against the latest attack by President Donald Trump, warned suppressing the free press was \"how dictators get started.\" \nThe Arizona Republican, a frequent critic of Trump, wasresponding to a tweet in which Trump accused the media of being“the enemy of the American people.” \nThe international order established after World War Two wasbuilt in part on a free press, McCain said in an excerpt of aninterview with NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that was released inadvance of the full Sunday morning broadcast. \n\"I hate the press. I hate you especially,\" he toldinterviewer Chuck Todd from an international security conferencein Munich. \"But the fact is we need you. We need a free press. We must have it. It's vital.\" \n\"If you want to preserve - I'm very serious now - if youwant to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have afree and many times adversarial press. And without it, I amafraid that we would lose so much of our individual libertiesover time. That's how dictators get started,\" he continued. \n\"They get started by suppressing free press. In other words,a consolidation of power. When you look at history, the firstthing that dictators do is shut down the press. And I'm notsaying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator. I'm justsaying we need to learn the lessons of history,\" McCain said. \nMcCain's comments followed Trump's tweet and came days afterthe president held a raucous news conference at which herepeatedly criticized news reports about disorder in the WhiteHouse and leaks of his telephone conversations with the leadersof Mexico and Australia. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel underscored the importanceof a free press at the Munich conference on Saturday, saying, \"Ihave high respect for journalists. We've always had goodresults, at least in Germany, by relying on mutual respect.\" \nMerkel did not mention Trump specifically, but calledfreedom of the press \"a very significant pillar of democracy.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:09:20.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
