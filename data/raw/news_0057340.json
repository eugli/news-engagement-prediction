Newly unsealed documents show Dylann Roof headed toward a 2nd black church after Emanuel shootings.

In December, a jury convicted him of 33 federal charges in the killing of nine people as they prayed at the end of a Bible study at the historic Charleston church known as Mother Emanuel. #DylannRoof , who was 18 at the time of the murders, showed no response to the reading of the verdict - local media https://t.co/Gx1gPBJ8EA pic.twitter.com/778eYjER5l — RT America (@RT_America) January 10, 2017 \nDuring Roof’s trial, prosecutors presented evidence showing he had lists of other black churches in his car when he was arrested in Shelby, North Carolina. \nOther documents show Roof confessed to a coworker in 2014 that he was racist. The comment came after someone made a racist joke. \nState prosecutors have pursued the death penalty against Roof for murder charges, but that trial was indefinitely postponed during his federal proceedings. Roof is also seeking a new federal trial, saying prosecutors didn't have jurisdiction to bring their case against him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:16:20.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
