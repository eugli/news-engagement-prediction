All scam-tainted leaders who were earlier with us are now with BJP,\" Gandhi said at a public meeting in Puhana after starting his roadshow from Bhagwanpur in Haridwar district which has the maximum number of 11 Assembly constituencies. \nAlso Read: People waive BJP flags, chant PM Narendra Modi's name in Rahul Gandhi's road show - Watch Video \nBeginning the roadshow from Bhagwanpur and crossing Har ki Pauri via Pirankaliyar, Puhana, Rampurchungi, Bijholi, Manglaur, Laksar and Landhaura, Gandhi's cavalcade covered a distance of 75 kms touching all the 11 constituencies. \nGandhi's roadshow in Haridwar district is important because many rebel Congress leaders now in BJP are contesting from seats located in the district including Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion from Khanpur and Pradeep Batra from Roorkee. \nHaridwar (rural), one of the two seats being contested by Chief Minister Harish Rawat, is also located in the district. \n(With Agency inputs) First Published: Monday, February 13, 2017 - 11:07 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:49:58.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
