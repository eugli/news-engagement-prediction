It will be available to customers on hm.com immediately following the show and in select stores beginning March 2. But we've already got a sneak peek of what you can expect from the new collection. H&M Most Popular These behind the scenes images from the collection's look book feature runway model vet Malgosia Bela and hint that we can expect some traditional tailoring teamed with sportswear elements in a fresh and modern clash. \"I love H&M and was so excited to be a part of their look book shoot,\" wrote 39-year-old Bela in an email. \"It's always fun to work with them and seeing all of their new collections come to life.\" H&M According to the model, H&M has had a special place in her heart dating back to her newbie days in the late '90s. \"H&M denim was probably the first thing I ever purchased at H&M. It must have been when I was just starting off my modeling career. I would go to H&M to pick up fashionable pieces. It's great because I can still shop there now. I buy clothes for my son all of the time there too.\" But that was then. What does the model plan on keeping from this collection? \"I love the pops of pink in H&M's Studio collection â€“ very fun,\" she writes. \"I would personally wear the black and white striped pajama set everyday if I could. I also love the white lace tops and dresses for the spring and summer.\" Check back on March 1 for the full H&M collection.
