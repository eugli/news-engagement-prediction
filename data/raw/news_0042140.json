In practice it would be difficult to determine which EU27 citizens were residing legally in the UK before the Brexit would have taken effect. \n“If all 3.3 million EU citizens were to initiate procedures aimed at proving the ‘exercise of treaty rights’ the administrative system would be overburdened.” \nThe future of EU nationals remains unclear as Prime Minister Theresa May has declined to assure them until she has secured rights for the more than one million Brits who live in other EU countries. \nAm Opinium poll for The Observer found that only five per cent of Britons think EU nationals currently living in the UK should be asked to leave. \nLabour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer told the paper: \"For months Labour has called for the PM to show a lead on this and to end unnecessary uncertainty for EU nationals. \n\"The PM needs to act swiftly to address this – both by unilaterally granting residency rights for EU nationals already in the UK and by ensuring the Home Office has the necessary resources in place.\" More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T12:11:42.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
