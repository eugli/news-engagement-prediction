It's really up to us to make this world a better place to live in. A + A - Image for representational purposes only. Picture courtesy: Twitter/@OdiseVucinas \nWhen was the last time you did something absolutely selfless for an absolute stranger? While most of you will take a while remembering, we won't be shocked if most others say \"never\". \nIn India, we are usually brought up with the ideology of putting us before others, especially in public. Before you get angry at that sentence, try to recall the last time you saw someone let you stand before them in a line, or someone who paid your change at a Metro counter? It's just 12 Rupees, but we won't do it for another person, because we have never thought about doing such a random act of kindness for an absolute stranger. In fact, acts of kindness have sadly become such a rarity in India that if a man takes street kids out for a meal, it starts \"trending\" on social media. \n\"Who is that person? Why should I help him out? Not like anyone has ever done that for me.\" \nThose thoughts aren't uncommon. \nBut fancy this: the circle of hatred/rudeness/selfishness is vicious. If you don't take the initiative of doing a good thing, no one will. It doesn't take much to make a stranger smile. And smiles are definitely the need of the hour, given the high-pressure lives we've grown accustomed to living. \nThe US and New Zealand realise the need of being kind to absolute strangers--and in turn build a better world to live in--and thus celebrate Random Acts of Kindness Day every year. While New Zealand celebrates it on November 4, America's day of kindness is February 17. This year, in fact, the US has decided to celebrate Random Acts of Kindness Week, which is currently underway. \nWhat's their form of celebration? Simple, just do something conventionally nice for another person--a person you don't know. \nSince we don't need a particular day or week to be nice to one another, here are some random things you can do for strangers around you--be it your colleagues, the stranger behind you at the Metro station, your society's guard or your office peon. \n* Let the car next to you in a jam cross first \n* Hold the door for the person entering after you \n* Say a heartfelt thank you to your house help or office boy \n* Buy chocolates for street kids \n* Pay for another person in your Metro line \n* Serve water/juice/soda to the delivery boy (summers are almost here) \n* Buy flowers for someone \n* Post anonymous sticky notes saying something uplifting \nDo you have any other ways you can make a stranger's day? Write to us and let us know. \nHere's to ending the circle of hatred, one precious smile at a time. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:43:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
