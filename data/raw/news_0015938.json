Key points: Kremlin says Russia has good relations with Iran that it hopes to develop Trump criticised Iran as having a disregard for the US Kremlin slams Fox's Bill O'Reilly's labelling of Putin as \"a killer\" \nMr Trump and Mr Putin have made clear they want to try to mend US-Russia ties , which have slid to a post-Cold War low in recent years. \nBut starkly different approaches to Iran, as set out by a raft of top Russian officials on Monday, could complicate any rapprochement. \nMr Trump told Fox News in an interview aired at the weekend that Iran had \"total disregard\" for the United States and labelled Tehran \"the number one terrorist state\", complaining it was sending arms and weapons \"all over the world\". \nHe spoke out after his administration put the Islamic Republic \"on notice\" following an Iranian ballistic missile test and imposed new economic sanctions. \nLast week, it was also reported that the Trump administration was exploring how to renegotiate key terms of the 2015 accord between Tehran and six world powers, under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program. \nBut several top officials in Russia, which has worked closely with Iran to support President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, have signalled they fundamentally disagreed with Mr Trump's approach to Tehran. Putin knows that for Trump, flattery will get you everywhere, writes Bruce Wolpe. \nWhen asked about Mr Trump's description of Iran as a \"terrorist state,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Moscow saw things very differently. \n\"Russia has friendly partner-like relations with Iran, we cooperate on a wide range of issues, value our trade ties, and hope to develop them further,\" Mr Peskov said. \n\"It's no secret for anyone that Moscow and Washington hold diametrically opposed views on many international issues,\" he added, saying that should not hinder a rapprochement. \nRussia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Djagaryan, said Moscow was concerned by escalating rhetoric between the United States and Iran, while Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Washington's decision to impose new sanctions on Iran was a source of regret. Kremlin demands apology from Fox News \nMeanwhile, the Kremlin added that it wanted an apology from Fox News over comments made by host Bill O'Reilly during the Trump interview. \nIn the interview, Mr O'Reilly described Mr Putin as \"a killer\" as he tried to press the US President to explain more fully why he respected his Russian counterpart. \n\"We consider such words from the Fox TV company to be unacceptable and insulting, and honestly speaking, we would prefer to get an apology from such a respected TV company,\" Mr Peskov said. \nFox News and Mr O'Reilly did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nUS intelligence agencies have accused Moscow of having sponsored computer hacking to help Mr Trump win office, and critics say he is too complimentary about the Russian leader. \nMr Trump, when commenting on the allegations against Mr Putin in the same interview, questioned how \"innocent\" the United States itself was, saying it had made a lot of its own mistakes. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:43:23.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
