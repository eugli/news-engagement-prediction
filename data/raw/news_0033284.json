Rick Snyder and President Donald Trump's views on immigration differ. (Photo: Mike Thompson, Detroit Free Press) Buy Photo CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nFor most of his first six years in office, Rick Snyder was fond of describing himself as \"the most pro-immigration governor in America.\" \nThese days, not so much. \nPrivately, Snyder clings to his conviction that robust immigration is a boon to Michigan's prosperity and critical to meeting the population goals he has set out for his final two years in Lansing. \nBut his voice has been conspicuously absent from the chorus of governors, state attorneys general and mayors criticizing the new administration's plans to restrict the flow of foreigners, including refugees and legal immigrants, who seek to live, study and work in the U.S. \nPresident Donald Trump's Jan. 27 executive order temporarily banning travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries and reneging on his predecessor's pledge to admit as many as 110,000 refugees from war-ravaged Syria has attracted the most criticism. After losing in an appeals court last week, the Trump administration on Friday waffled on whether it would take the case to the Supreme Court. \nBut so far, neither Snyder nor most of the large Michigan employers keen to recruit skilled workers from abroad have registered public objections to the new administration's anti-immigrant initiatives. A persuader, not a pugilist \nGubernatorial spokesman Ari Adler says his boss' reticence shouldn't surprise anyone familiar with the Snyder MO. \n\"It's not this governor's style to be confrontational,\" Adler reminded me last week, insisting that Snyder has been working quietly behind the scenes to make sure both the White House and the Republican Congress understand how important immigrants are to Michigan's prospects for economic growth. \nDoes Snyder think Trump's proposed limitations on travel and refugee resettlement threaten those plans? \n\"He hasn't really taken a position on that,\" Adler replied. \"He's trying to be one of the people who is straddling the issue in the middle.\" \nFor all the attention it has received, Trump's executive order on travel is likely just the opening salvo in an offensive that targets legal immigrants as well as political refugees. \nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., last week introduced legislation that dramatically reduces eligibility for a green card, the credential that guarantees a non-citizen's right to permanent residency. The bill, which Cotton says has received an encouraging reception from the Trump White House, would ultimately cap the number of legal immigrants at about half the 675,000 currently permitted to enter the country each year. \nThe focus on reining in the immigration of computer programmers from India as well as jihadists from Yemen is consistent with the objective two of the president's top advisers, Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, outlined in a conversation broadcast last March. \nBannon, the consigliere-in-chief behind the contested travel ban, was hosting a satellite radio program for Breitbart News Daily when he asked Miller, then one of the Trump campaign's leading immigration advisers, whether the campaign's focus on deporting undocumented immigrants wasn't downplaying a more serious threat to U.S. sovereignty. \n\"As horrific as that (illegal immigration) is — and it's horrific — don't we have a problem?\" Bannon asked. \"We've looked the other way on this legal immigration that has kind of overwhelmed the country.\" \nBannon went on to complain about the high-tech \"oligarchs\" who were looking to U.S.universities \"full of people from South Asia and East Asia\" to fill engineering jobs that should rightfully go to native-born Americans. \nMiller, now an immigration policy specialist in the West Wing, seconded Bannon's assertion that \"the beating heart of the problem\" was the number of H-1B visas approved for college-educated foreigners. \n\"When you pick up a copy of the newspaper, you will often see the phrase 'high-skilled immigration,' \" Miller said. \"I just don't ever use that phrase, because the reality is we are talking about less-skilled foreign guest workers that are less educated than Americans, who are paid less than Americans, who know less about the computing industry and the technology than Americans — so I just don't use that phrase.\" \n► Raw Data: Refugees in Michigan, by the numbers Success and vulnerability \nBesides mocking the notion of a meritocratic America in which talent trumps race and national origin, the sentiments expressed by Bannon and Miller are a dagger pointed at the heart of the Snyder administration's plans to grow Michigan's skilled labor market. \nSnyder said as much in his most recent State of the State address , although it took my Free Press colleague Kristi Tanner's data-crunching prowess to decode his message. \n\"To give you a fact you might be amazed by, but we should be really proud, our state has the highest net-bound inward migration of people with bachelor’s degrees of any state in the Great Lakes region,\" Snyder said in his Jan. 17 address to a joint session of the state Legislature. \nBut as Tanner deduced after examining the census data, Michigan owes its net increase in residents with bachelor's degrees almost entirely to its success in attracting college graduates from abroad. \nIf you count only degree holders who moved within the U.S., Michigan actually lost 26,499 more college graduates to other states (135,443) than it attracted from them (108,944) between 2013 and 2015. But that domestic deficit was more than erased by the 46,203 bachelors degree recipients who moved to Michigan from abroad. \nMichigan's 19,704 net increase in college grads from both sources — other states and foreign countries — easily eclipsed the increases posted by the seven other Great Lakes states. \nThe corollary, of course, is that Michigan is more vulnerable than its neighboring states to any restrictions on the lawful entry of the degree-holding immigrants Bannon and Miller disparage. That's why the Trump administration's efforts to impose new restrictions is likely to face concerted opposition from Michigan employers and the politicians who represent them. Skeptical but gun-shy \nHow visible that opposition will be to the general public is another matter. \nTrump typically responds to even the most measured criticism with bare-knuckled fury -- and no governor or CEO wants to become the target of one of the president's social media offensives. \nSnyder also understands that moderating Trump's reckless immigration initiatives will require him to address the fears of Americans who continue to see immigration as a threat to the nation's security and their own prosperity. To many Republicans, I'm sure, the governor's effort to engage with both sides in the immigration debate is a refreshing contrast to the president's bellicose certitude. \nBut the line between avoiding public confrontation with a demagogues and appeasing him is a fine one. Snyder stumbled across it during the presidential campaign last summer when he tried to straddle the divide between Michiganders eager to welcome refugees from Syria and Trump supporters convinced that any increase in Muslim immigration threatens to the state's security. \nThe governor's solution then was to withhold his approval for any refugee resettlement here until he could be satisfied that the federal government's vetting process was sufficiently rigorous. But there were two problems with this seemingly measured approach. \nFor starters, the permission to settle refugees in Michigan was not his (or any governor's) to deny. Someone unfamiliar with Snyder might have concluded that he was clueless about the federal government's exclusive dominion over immigration policy. But the governor was merely exploiting the ignorance of Trump's Islamophobic constituents. \nThen there was the governor's disingenuous concern about the famously rigorous vetting process for prospective refugees, a transparent stall for time. \nLast week, Adler again insisted that Snyder had merely been seeking more detailed information about the process, and that he had eventually received it. \nSo did the additional information satisfy the governor's concerns? Or did he share the new president's view that the intensive vetting to which would-be refugees are subjected is inadequate to weed out likely terrorists? \nAdler said Snyder hadn't come to any conclusions about that. \nBut that's not caution; that's cowardice masquerading as circumspection. \nNo one expects a congenitally diplomatic fellow like Snyder to challenge his party's president to a street fight — and Snyder might well be risking more than he stands to gain in a public showdown over immigration policy. \nBut it's delusional to believe that his measured, behind-the-scenes approach will prevail if Trump succeeds in rallying his constituents to an all-out war on immigration. \nMichigan's governor hates to make a scene. But the time is coming when he and other pro-immigration Republicans may have to rise from their seats and point out that the crowded theater in which they and their constituents are anxiously huddled is, in fact, on fire. \nContact Brian Dickerson: bdickerson@freepress.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:27:30.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
