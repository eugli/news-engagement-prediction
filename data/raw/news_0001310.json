Should she violate the ruling she would face the incredibly severe punishment of a €250,000 fine or six months in prison. \n“This punishment is, however, very unlikely,” a court spokesperson said. \nThe severity of the fine was based on a ruling made by the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) in 2015. In that case, the court decided that people are prohibited from smoking during particular windows of time in the day because smoking presents a significant disturbance to others. The prohibited time varies on a case-by-case basis. \nLate last year, a similar ruling in neighboring Austria restricted a man from smoking on his balcony between 8am to 10am, 12pm to 3pm, and 6pm to 8pm between May 1 and October 31.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:30:28.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
