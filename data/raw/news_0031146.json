She is doing the same now also. #Chinnamma,\" the party's official Twitter handle, @AIADMKOfficial said. \nOn Twitter, the AIADMK quoted Sasikala as saying: “In the past whenever Amma was in crisis, I also suffered. This time also, I will take it upon me. 'Dharma' will win.” \nIn a major setback for Sasikala Natarajan, who was aspiring to be the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, the Supreme Court today restored her conviction in decades-old disproportionate assets case. \nA division bench of Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose and Justice Amitava Roy set aside a Karnataka High Court order staying the conviction of Sasikala and three by a trial court. \nThe court directed Sasikala and the others to \"immediately\" surrender before the trial court and ordered them to serve the remaining portion of their jail term. \nJustice Roy, in a concurring judgment, expressed deep concern over the \"escalating menace of corruption in society\".
