Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times Amazon isn’t alone in using Seattle, home to Starbucks and other major retail brands, as a proving ground for new ideas in stores. But it is the main attraction among people focused on innovation in the category. “I look at Seattle as the center of the retail universe,” said Herb Sorensen, a researcher and consultant to brands on shopping behavior, referring to Amazon’s activities in the city. \nAdvertisement   Amazon declines to talk about the drive-up grocery stores it is building here. The most obvious reason the company tries out new ideas in its own backyard is that it makes life easier for corporate leadership to see them in action without having to get on planes. Executives closely scrutinize how customers use new stores and tweak them as they gather data. “Amazon is a frugal company,” said John Rossman, a former executive with the company who is a managing director with Alvarez & Marsal, a business consulting firm. “They don’t want to be flying teams around a lot to have them be hands-on with their beta operations and experiences.” Amazon’s own technologically demanding employees are an important part of the feedback process. More than 25,000 of them work for the company in Seattle, and many serve as the first test cases for new concepts. The company opened its first Amazon Go store on the ground floor of one of its office buildings, where employees can buy prepared meals, drinks and snacks. Customers enter the store through a gate with a smartphone app and simply walk out with their goods when they’re done.

Almost a decade ago, the company conducted one of its biggest local experiments when it started a grocery home delivery service, tinkering for almost five years before expanding the concept to a new city. Early on, Amazon allowed employees and their friends to use the service, which helped provide unvarnished feedback, said Ian Clarkson, then the general manager of the service, AmazonFresh. Mr. Clarkson recalls a friend telling him that AmazonFresh didn’t stock a brand of orange juice her daughter liked. As a result, she said, she wouldn’t shop through AmazonFresh since she would still need to go to a supermarket for the juice. Mr. Clarkson, now the chief operating officer at Varsity Tutors, an online tutoring service, said the comment was an eye-opener. “We’ve got to be a lot better at that,” he thought at the time. “You’re losing a basket as opposed to a unit.” Photo Starbucks used Seattle to test the concept of a Roastery.

Starbucks opened its first coffee house in the Pike Place Market in 1971. \nAdvertisement   Like Amazon, Starbucks tests projects locally before exporting them elsewhere. It opened its first Roastery , a high-end coffee bar, in an old Packard car dealership in the city, and plans to open up to 30 more in places as far-flung as Shanghai, New York and Tokyo. Several years ago, it came up with a new idea for building drive-through Starbucks stores out of recycled shipping containers to promote sustainability, trying out the design just south of Seattle before opening others across the country. “It’s very much a community of early adopters,” said Leonard Garfield, executive director of the Museum of History and Industry in Seattle.

Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times One of Amazon’s more puzzling retail experiments in Seattle is the Treasure Truck, a roaming delivery truck retrofitted with carnival-style lights and signs, from which customers can pick up items offered during flash sales through the Amazon mobile app. The truck, which seems like the offspring of a billboard and an ice cream truck, has sold wild mahi-mahi steaks, paddle boards and Nintendo game consoles. Adam Croft, an audio producer for Microsoft, described the Treasure Truck as a “party bus” and said he had bought a drone and a “Star Wars” BB-8 droid toy from it. He has also patronized Amazon’s bookstore in Seattle and thought it was clever of the company to require customers to scan bar codes on books with their phones to get prices, which can fluctuate. “Seattleites will say they hate Amazon taking over downtown, but at the same time when Amazon rolls out something special, after everyone complains about it, the first thing people want to do is go check it out,” said Mr. Croft, who says his employment with another technology company doesn’t color his views of Amazon.
