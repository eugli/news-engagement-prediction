So potentially every part of the ship can be affected significantly,” Daniel Rieger, a transport policy officer and researcher for NABU who analyzed the data told The Travel . Rieger added that the German Lung Association has long warned passengers against staying on deck or inhaling the ships' exhaust gases, as it could be devastating for people with existing lung diseases.\nThe World Health Organization says inhaling ultra-fine particles is as dangerous as breathing asbestos.\nMore concerning, notes the team, is that inhaling these ultra-fine particles can lead to lung diseases, heart attacks, strokes and has been linked to diabetes.\nCRUISE LINES WEIGH IN ON POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN\nIn addition to the toxic particles coming from the ship's funnels, passengers are also exposed to nitrogen oxides and heavy metals coming from the combustion of marine diesel fuel and heavy oil – an issue of concern on nearly all cruise ships.\nHelge Grammerstorf, the German national director of the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) and a former ship captain and ship broker, denied the validity of the study, arguing that a more systematic test over a longer period of time needs to be done.\n“We don't know these measurements. The claim is completely unsubstantiated,” he told Hamburger Abendblatt, a German daily newspaper.\nFOR THE LATEST TRAVEL FEATURES FOLLOW FOX LIFESTYLE ON FACEBOOK\nNABU says the major contributors to the poor air quality are bad fuel and lack of a quality exhaust system. Reiger suggests that ships could clean up their act by simply switching to better fuel and adding better filters.\nLeif Miller, a NABU manager, told Deutsche Welle that cruise lines \"pay huge sums to improve entertainment and gastronomical services on board, but save as much as they can when it comes to environmental protection.”\nThe study has environmentalists wondering if cruise companies choose to look the other way when it comes to protecting the places they visit.", "external_links": ["https://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2012/pdfs/pr213_E.pdf", "https://www.facebook.com/FoxNewsLeisure/", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/news/air-pollution-levels-200-times-higher-on-cruise-ships/", "http://www.dw.com/en/hoping-for-a-fresh-sea-breeze-aboard-a-cruise-ship-better-hold-your-nose/a-37284464http:/www.dw.com/en/hoping-for-a-fresh-sea-breeze-aboard-a-cruise-ship-better-hold-your-nose/a-37284464"], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T12:50:11.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
