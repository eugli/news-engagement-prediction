The program, kicked off in 2014, has hired 8,000 veterans .\nAlthough most of the Twitter rage was focused on American operations, Schultz noted that Starbucks does business in 75 countries and that the hiring would take place over five years.\nThis isn’t the first boycott directed at Starbucks. In September, manyÂ Trump supporters said they would buy their coffee elsewhere after Schultz endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton, saying, “On the other side, weâve seen such vitriolic display of bigotry and hate and divisiveness, and that is not the leadership we need for the future of the country.”\nWhat do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T16:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:17:37.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
