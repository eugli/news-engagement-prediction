Article continues below \nThe result means Madrid go back above Barcelona , who beat Atletico Madrid 2-1 at the Vicente Calderon earlier in the day, into pole position at the top of La Liga. \nAs well as a one-point advantage over Luis Enrique’s side, Los Blancos also have a game in hand. Article continues below There were a couple of controversial moments \nHowever, Madrid’s victory wasn’t without its controversial moments. \nRonaldo scored from the penalty spot after Madrid were awarded a spot-kick following a handball by Bruno Soriano - a decision by referee Jesus Gil that irked the Barcelona defender Gerard Pique. Watch: Real Madrid win a bizarre free-kick \nWhile in the first half, there was a bizarre incident where Gil awarded the away team a free-kick after Bale pushed over his own goalkeeper, Keylor Navas. \nYes, you read that right. Madrid were defending a corner and somehow won a free-kick after Bale shoved Navas. Genius, cheating or a foul on Bale? \nPeople on Twitter aren’t sure whether this was genius or an example of brazen cheating. \nWhile it’s possible that Bale received a push himself before shoving Navas, the camera angle of the incident doesn’t prove whether that’s the case - although it would make sense. \nMake up your own minds… Zidane: The players thought it was a penalty \nOn the decision to award Madrid a penalty, Zidane was quoted by the club’s official website as saying: \"The players have said that it was a handball. I didn't see it from where I was and I'll never interfere with refereeing decisions. \n“He awarded it and that's that. We performed much better in the second half than we did in the first. We got into more scoring positions and ultimately we come away with three points against opposition that can make life tough for you. We're happy to have taken three points against a great side.” \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
