Key points: Two students, a teacher were stabbed at Bonnyrigg High School A 16-year-old student was arrested and is expected to be charged Police said incident not terrorism-related \nEmergency services were called to the school on Elizabeth Drive, just before 8:45am today. \nPolice said the school was put into lockdown after the incident. \nA 48-year-old female teacher was stabbed in the back, while two Year 11 students — a 16-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl — were stabbed in the shoulder. \nThe woman and the boy were taken to Liverpool Hospital and girl was taken to Westmead Hospital. \nAll three are in a stable condition and their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. \nAnother 16-year-old boy was arrested in a car park nearby and three knives were seized, police said. \nThe alleged offender was taken to Fairfield Police Station and is assisting police with inquiries. \nPolice said he was expected to be charged at some point today. Incident a 'one off': police \nFairfield Local Area Commander Superintendent Peter Lennon said the student was not an \"outstanding student, nor were there any other incidents that the principal knew the student had been involved in.\" \n\"We're in the process of speaking to witnesses and we have police at the hospital waiting to speak to the victims,\" he added. \nSuperintendent Lennon said it was a \"a one-off incident\". \n\"This is not terrorism related, this is a local issue at a local school. \nSuperintendent Lennon said the attack happened as the teacher was opening a classroom. \n\"The classroom is closed off as a crime scene,\" he said. 'Sick to my stomach' \nLauren O'Reilly, whose son attends Bonnyrigg High School, said she had struggled to get information about what was happening at the time. \n\"My son just started Year 7 and I don't know what's going on,\" she said. \n\"I feel sick to my stomach to be honest... I've called the school and they've just said everything's gone back to normal. \n\"I said, 'can you tell me what happened?' They don't know. \n\"I want to know that all the kids are alright, not just my child. \n\"I feel sick for whoever's child, for whoever's wife or husband is in there.\" \nHowever, Superintendent Lennon said the school had prepared well for a similar situation. \n\"I understand some of the students and teachers were upset,\" he said. \n\"However, they have processes in place to lock the school down to keep the school secure and safe, which they went about very professionally. \n\"They actually practice these sorts of procedures.\" \nIn a statement, the Department of Education said counselling and support would be available at the school for affected students and staff. \n\"As this is a police matter it is inappropriate for the department to provide further comment,\" the department said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:31:54.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
