After ascending the first flight of stairs, look to your right to break your first set of pots. \nBreakable 2/5 \nHead inside the building, and you’ll find the second breakable at the back right corner of the room. \nObservable 2/5 \nLeave the building via its back exit, and check out the flaming tower in the vista on your right. \nBreakable 3/5 \nContinue onto the capturable zone ahead, and find the Breakable pots on the left. \nBreakable 4/5 \nLeave the zone in the same direction you were heading, and just beyond the small wooden tower, nestled on the right, will be the penultimate Breakable. \nObservable 3/5 \nMove back into the centre of the battlefield, and look at the large eagle statue on your left. \nObservable 4/5 \nExactly opposite the eagle, on the other side of the battlefield, is a giant battering ram, which is the fourth Observable. \nBreakable 5/5 \nOn the enemy’s side of the war zone, you’ll spot a ladder to the left. Climb up it and go inside the building at the top to come across the final Breakable. \nObservable 5/5 \nBefore leaving that area, explore the balcony on the left side and look at the damaged wall for your last Observable of the mission. 1.3 The Blackstone Legion \nYou’ll spot the first Breakable straight ahead as soon the level begins. \nObservable 1/9 \nCheck out the caged prisoner hanging from the tree directly in front of you. \nObservable 2/9 \nRun down the slope and look out towards the cliff face ahead. \nObservable 3/9 \nThere is a geyser immediately your left from here. You can’t miss it, but don’t get too close! \nObservable 4/9 \nAs you cross the bridge to head into the fortress, take a gander at the banner on the right side of the entrance. \nObservable 5/9 \nMove through the fortress doors and look at the makeshift archway before you. \nBreakable 2/5 \nWalk right back into the far right corner of the fortress and you’ll locate the second Breakable. \nBreakable 3/5 \nGo round the back of the main building to find an alcove on the left side, where a Breakable will be sitting. \nObservable 6/9 \nAfter you’ve killed the first boss in the fortress, exit through the back gates and look directly at the statue in front of you. \nBreakable 4/5 \nOn the left side of this statue, incidentally, lies a Breakable. \nObservable 7/9 \nProgress forward a little bit before checking out the mini graveyard situated up on the left. \nObservable 8/9 \nKeep going onwards towards the rogue knights but, before reaching that, veer right and you’ll find a giant statue. \nBreakable 5/5 \nRight next to the statue, on the left, will be the last breakable. \nObservable 9/9 \nAs you venture up the flight of stairs towards the marker, gaze up slightly at the top of the ruined building.
