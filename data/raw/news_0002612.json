I couldn't even talk.\" \nShe had owned the Samsung Galaxy S6 phone for about two years and had never had any trouble with in the past. \n\"It was very scary,\" she said. \nThe phone was destroyed. \nA spokesman for Samsung New Zealand said customer safety was its highest priority, and the company was \"deeply concerned\" by the incident. \n\"We have spoken to a family member of the customer to apologise and offer support. \n\"We believe this is an isolated incident, as we are unaware of any known issues with the Galaxy S6; however we are taking the incident very seriously and will be conducting a full investigation into the matter.\" \nHundreds of smartphone owners around the world sued Samsung Electronics after damage from spontaneous phone fires relating to the Galaxy Note 7 model. \nThe S6 model was not previously believed to have had similar issues. \nTimaru Girls' High School principal Sarah Davis said the hall was evacuated and there was no danger to students. \nStaff had been debriefed and there would be a debrief with students as well, she said. \n\"It was kind of alarming, it went bang. \n\"The important thing is that Ella's safe.\" \nThe powhiri was held on the tennis courts outside instead, she said. \nAnyone concerned about their Samsung phone can contact Samsung New Zealand's support line on 0800 726 786. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:06:38.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
