The college's principal, Lee Kilgour said: 'Existing students in Years 11 and 13 within the UTC will, of course, continue to follow their current courses and complete these in the summer term 2017. Principal Lee Kilgour said teaching would continue until the school closes 'I also wish to assure you that we will endeavour to ensure that teaching and learning within the college will continue with the present teaching staff and therefore ensure that students are well prepared for examinations this summer. 'We will be working closely with Oldham Local Authority and other local education providers to bring about a smooth transition for existing students in Years 10 and 12. We will do everything in our power to ensure this process is both detailed and thorough.' Gordon Main, chair of the Greater Manchester University Technical College (GM UTC) Trust, said: 'Closing The GM UTC is hugely disappointing for all those who have worked so hard to give students the opportunity to pursue a technical education. 'The wellbeing and success of all our students remains our highest priority. Every effort will be made to ensure students get the support they need to complete their studies successfully and receive appropriate guidance for transition to their new place of learning.' The vocational learning centre had hoped to attract teenagers aged 14-19 interested in a career in engineering or technology when it opened a new building on the grounds of Oldham College in September 2014.
