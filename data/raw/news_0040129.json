LIVE EVENT \nThe Beast Incarnate and his advocate, Paul Heyman made an appearance at the live event, where they interrupted an eight-man tag team match which saw The Golden Truth teaming up with Sin Cara and Curtis Axel, as they battled Bo Dallas, Titus O’Neil and The Shining Stars.

Article continues below \nHe then followed that up with another huge suplex on Epico, before dishing out another to Bo Dallas, something he's used to. SUPLEX CITY \nAxel was the fourth victim visiting Suplex City, before Primo suffered the same fate. \nTitus O’Neil was the lucky – or unlucky – one as he avoided eating a suplex, but Lesnar hit him with a massive F5 instead. \nFortunately for Goldust and R-Truth, it seems as if they were the only ones that managed to get away without Lesnar getting his hands on them. \nThe reaction from the lucky Dallas audience said it all, and some of them took to social media to share their excitement. \nLesnar’s night didn’t end there, though. \nHeyman proceeded to call out The Big Show, and as expected, The Beast went on to win the match before the intermission. \nThis is exactly why Lesnar is promoted as a star attraction, and fans pay good money to see him, even if it isn't for very long. \nWhat did you make of Brock Lesnar’s dominating stint at the Dallas house show?
