I say it’s better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us with the fight against ISIS — which is a major fight — and Islamic terrorism all over the world, that’s a good thing. Will I get along with him? I have no idea. It’s very possible I won’t.” \n“But he’s a killer, though,” O’Reilly then notes. “Putin’s a killer.” \n“There are a lot of killers. We’ve got a lot of killers,” Trump responds. “What do you think — our country’s so innocent?” O’Reilly: “Putin’s a killer.” \nTrump: “…we’ve got a lot of killers.
