who cannot be named due to her age - received a 12-month referral order. \nAlong with Coveney she was also ordered to pay the victim Â£960 in compensation. \nSurrey Police said they assaulted the teenager with a crowbar at Stoughton recreation ground in Northway on the evening of January 9 2016. \nDetective Constable Carina Jewell said: \"This was a horrific and violent attack which has had a profound effect on a teenage girl's life. \n\"As well as suffering extremely serious injuries, she was left traumatised by the incident and suffered continued bullying and abuse as a result. \n\"She was eventually forced to move schools for a fresh start. \n\"A media appeal was issued following the incident and it was the attention on social media that led to the girls eventually handing themselves in at Guildford Police Station. \n\"At first they denied using any kind of weapon during the attack but messages were found on all their phones mentioning the assault and the crowbar and how to clean it, and all three were subsequently charged with GBH.\" \nDC Jewell commended their victim for coming forward and giving evidence against her attackers \"under very challenging circumstances\". \nShe said: \"I hope that the sentence handed out today serves as a stark reminder that we will not tolerate violence in our local communities and that we will remain committed to bringing those who commit such offences to justice.\" More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:22:51.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
