At 19, he made one in South Africa. Three of the toughest assignments for a touring batsman, especially one raised on slow and low pitches on the subcontinent, and he aced the lot. \nThe reverse hasn’t often happened. Despite what Ian Chappell has often said and written, about it being easier to adjust to low bounce, few young players have travelled to this part of the world and thrived. In the last two decades, only one non-Asian player under the age of 21 has come to India and scored a Test ton – Kane Williamson in Ahmedabad in November 2010. \nEarlier this season, Haseeb Hameed made 82 in Rajkot and 59 not out in Mohali. Born in Bolton, Hameed – ten months younger than Renshaw – has roots in Gujarat, and trained in Mumbai as a teenager. Touring India wasn’t exactly a culture shock for him. \nFor Renshaw, who smiled his way through the close-of-play press conference, even when asked about cruel barbs from former players about his sprint to the WC, this was very much a baptism by tandoor. By 10am, the temperature in Pune had gone past 36C, and with the humidity in the low 20s, you could have placed a meat patty on the granite steps leading to the stands and seen it done rare in no time. \nLive stream India v Australia Test Series LIVE on FOX SPORTS.

He was ripping it square, varying his pace, and putting so much action on the ball that the batsmen probably heard it whirring as it reached them. \nRenshaw survived that passage of play – tucking away a couple of leg-side fours for good measure – before having the audacity to take on Ravindra Jadeja, a man harder to hit than Muhammad Ali in his 1960s heyday. \nAll the toilet humour and the unkind words that followed his retiring ill unfortunately took away much of the attention from an extremely accomplished innings. “They applied themselves really well,” said Sanjay Bangar, India’s batting coach, speaking primarily about Renshaw. “You could see that they were working hard, they trusted their defence, used their feet quite a bit – all facets of good batsmanship against spin bowling.” \nCrucially, Renshaw didn’t fall into the trap that consumes so many visiting batsmen – the hesitant hard-handed prod while reaching for the ball. He either made full use of his height to reach forward and smother the spin, or he went back deep in the crease – as Damien Martyn had done so masterfully in 2004, when he made two centuries and a 97 – to deflect the ball behind square. Renshaw, Starc lead the way 2:34 \nLike Hameed, Renshaw’s batting tempo belongs to another era. It’s not that they can’t play shots – Hameed played some scorching drives in Mohali, while Renshaw’s flourish down the ground after stepping out to Jayant Yadav was probably the shot of the day. It’s more that periods of calm don’t frustrate them. Ashwin beat the outside edge repeatedly, but Renshaw put each such episode behind him and just focused on the next ball. \nEngland’s batsmen made six centuries in the five-Test series late last year, four of them on a Rajkot featherbed. They also had 16 half-centuries. That profligacy cost them the series, and it’s something Renshaw will need to guard against. Joe Root made 491 runs, with five scores over 50, but there was not one defining innings. \nOnce you get a start in India, you have to Phar Lap it. Even Jayant did in the Mumbai Test against England, racing to a hundred from No.9 with Virat Kohli for company. A first-innings score of 68 seldom wins you Tests in these conditions. Saha takes absolute screamer 0:43 \nAustralian batting prodigies have had mixed results in India. Ricky Ponting struggled horribly on his first four tours, with just a 60 at Eden Gardens (1998) to show for his troubles. By contrast, Michael Clarke made a twinkle-toed century on debut in Bangalore. Both men, however, were significantly older than Renshaw, who only turns 21 at the end of this series. \nThat he had his temperament questioned, on a day when he saw off 156 balls in the most testing conditions, says more about a certain toxic culture that still bedevils Australian cricket. “For a young player playing in his first Test in India, he showed a lot of character,” said Bangar. \nHe most certainly did. \nDileep Premachandran is editor-in-chief of Wisden India .
