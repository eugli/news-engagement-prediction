As you can see in the invite above, the new handset will be officially unveiled on February 26 - no surprise here . The invite also informs us that the LG G6 offers a \"big screen that fits.\" As reported not long ago, this is a 5.7-inch screen with 1440 x 2880 pixels and a 9:18 aspect ratio , so it will appear a bit more elongated than regular displays (usually, these have 9:16 aspect ratios). LG even has a special name for this display, calling it \"Full Vision.\" Leaked photos and renders do suggest that the LG G6 has almost no bezels on the left and right of its screen. And while we would not go as far as calling the smartphone bezel-less, the G6 seems to offer a pretty high screen-to-body ratio, and it will likely rival Samsung's Galaxy S8 in this regard. Earlier today, we learned that the LG G6 should be released on March 10 in South Korea, but it may not reach US shores before April 7. Besides an unusual display, the G6 is expected to feature a water-resistant metal body, a USB Type-C port, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, non-removable battery, and a dual rear camera. The smartphone will surely run Android 7 Nougat out of the box. Let us know if you're excited about the upcoming arrival of the LG G6, will you?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:36:07.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
