Rodriguez/Getty Images This Is Us star Chrissy Metz is opening up about body shaming and has credited actresses like Melissa McCarthy and Rebel Wilson for helping change the perception of plus-sized people. “They’re pioneering this way that art is finally catching up to life, and women and people alike are seeing themselves in movies and on TV,” the 36-year-old actress recently told Sirius XM’s Jenny Hutt . “I love that with Melissa, it’s never an issue about her weight. It’s like, ‘You’re freakin’ hilarious and talented -- let’s talk about that.'\" EXCLUSIVE: ‘This Is Us’ Star Chrissy Metz Says Men Are Ashamed to Date Plus-Size Women “I think that will happen for me, but right now I think it’s so important that we’re having those conversations, because when you’re knowledgeable about something the fear goes away and so many people are afraid of fat people,” Metz continued. “It’s crazy and I hate to say that, but until we educate people and figure out what the real issue is, people are going to be afraid of it.” Metz went on to express her disgust at recent criticism about Lady Gaga’s body following her performance during the Super Bowl halftime show. The “Paparazzi” singer was publicly shamed after baring her belly during the show. “That made me bonkers, bananas crazy,” said Metz . “How is someone fat if they’re not fat? I want to see somebody else get on that stage and do what she damn did! I think what’s the core of the issue is we project all our crap onto other people, and if we’re genuinely happy with ourselves and love ourselves, then you can’t talk sh*t about other people. You can’t be hateful because you love yourself.” Metz also discussed the danger of “the other side,” of the body shaming issue, when celebrities are dissed for being super-skinny. EXCLUSIVE: Chrissy Metz Opens Up About Strained Relationship With Her Own Father “It’s more about [being] unhealthy mentally and emotionally -- that’s what’s concerning,” Metz said, adding that she was appalled when singer Ke$ha was labelled too skinny. “And I don’t know their plight or their issues. It’s very easy to be like, ‘She’s too skinny,’ or people saying I’m too fat. I hope there’s conversation about [it] and hopefully, it’s not [always] an issue.” Speaking about her professional dreams beyond the hit NBC series, Metz shared her hopes to appear on Broadway, write an episode of This Is Us and explore music. She also wants to help aspiring actors and scriptwriters. “I want to be the Judd Apatow with my friends -- just have this cool compound, communal, collaborative art thing.” See Metz talk to ET about men being secretly ashamed to date plus-sized women in the video below.
