The Oregon junior forward and all-around MVP kept the Ducks‚Äô hopes for a Pac-12 title and a No. 1 NCAA Tournament seed alive with a winning 3-pointer to beat California 68-65 on Wednesday night at Berkeley, California. \nWhat a night for college hoops. This pairs so well with John Gillon‚Äôs winner for Syracuse . How about that: Gillon and Dillon with the biggest shots of the night. \nHere it is. ‚Äî Rob Dauster (@RobDauster) February 23, 2017 \nWhat an ending after Cal led most of the game. The Golden Bears (18-9, 9-6 conference) not only lose, but let a massive opportunity slip away, as they would‚Äôve been so much closer to an NCAA Tournament bid with a win. Instead, Cal has lost three straight and still has two road games remaining. \nBrooks and the Ducks (25-4, 14-2) have games at Stanford and Oregon State remaining. Oregon got a 1 seed in last year‚Äôs NCAA Tournament, and at this point the Ducks are looking even stronger than the group that made the Elite Eight in 2016. Look out. \nLet‚Äôs enjoy that again, Titanic-style DILLON BROOKS DOES IT AGAIN!!! HE NAILS A GAME WINNING 3 TO BEAT CAL!!! WHAT A SHOT!!! IT'S MUCH BETTER W/TITANIC MUSIC!!! üèÄüö¢üéº ( @OregonMBB ) pic.twitter.com/jPm1wsESPQ ‚Äî Titanic Hoops (@TitanicHoops) February 23, 2017 \nBrooks is also making a habit of hitting huge shots. You‚Äôll recall he opened the Pac-12 slate by knocking off UCLA in the final second. \nHaving a guy with this in his veins is a tremendous asset come March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:22:17.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
