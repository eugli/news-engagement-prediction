Back in the days when they were a second division side, Die Roten Bullen came up against former VFB Stuttgart II, who can barely remember the moment in question considering it was over in a matter of seconds. Throwback to when RB Leipzig started in a 2-0-8 formation and scored after just 8.6 seconds  pic.twitter.com/67FDw1YzIn — 90min (@90min_Football) 19 February 2017 Rather bizarrely, Leipzig appeared to lineup with as many as seven players stood on the halfway line. Perhaps a little confused by what was going on, the Stuttgart players could only watch as the ball was kicked long when the match began, before a neat move ended up with Daniel Frahn heading home from close range. All of that happened inside eight seconds and gives true perspective on what going ultra attacking really means. Sadly, Ralph Hasenhüttl's side have yet to deploy such an unusually aggressive tactic this season, but whilst the club divide opinion in Germany, even the most ardent of critics would have to applaud such fine play, should we to be lucky enough to see it happen again.
