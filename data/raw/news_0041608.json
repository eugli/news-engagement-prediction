this article Share The exhibition’s final room holds a number of the dresses Diana auctioned off for charity, at her son William’s suggestion, shortly before her death in 1997. They include a green silk velvet evening dress by Catherine Walker, which she wore for a Vanity Fair photoshoot with Mario Testino, and a beautiful ‘dignified showstopper’ by the same designer, in grey silk satin with imitation pearl embroidery, which she wore to a state dinner with the King of Malaysia in 1992. ‘It was widely reported that the auction was a symbolic event, a way for Diana to close a chapter on her royal life and embark on a new one. Just a few months later, she died,’ says Eleri.’ What, in Eleri’s opinion, are the exhibition’s stand-out pieces? ‘If I had to choose two dresses, her “debs” gown [a flouncy Regamus dress she wore to a ball as a teenager] would be one of them. It’s very of its time, very frilly, very lacy. There’s a real innocence about it. ‘The other would be totally different: the black, halter-neck Catherine Walker dress she wore for the Mario Testino photoshoot just before she died. It’s got such a beautiful, streamlined silhouette and is so simple and understated — yet very difficult to pull off. ‘I think the contrast shows just how far Diana had come in her short but incredible life.’ The dress was first bought at auction by a woman from Florida and sold on for £90,000 Sequins and a sexy secret... Catherine Walker, 1986 Dubbed ‘my mermaid dress’ by Diana, every inch of this dramatic gown is embellished with sequins and was designed to shimmer under the flash-bulbs that followed her every move. Typical of her so-called Dynasty phase — after the dramatic shoulder pads and lavish fabrics favoured in the glamorous TV show — Walker’s evening dress was beautifully embroidered by the legendary textile designer Jakob Schlaepfer and it clung to every curve. With its swooping neckline, structured shoulders and ruched detailing — all of which highlighted her slender waist — it was an outfit designed to show off Diana, the dazzlingly desirable woman. Only later did the reason for that new-found body confidence become clear. In 1986, when she first wore it during an official visit to Vienna, the 25-year-old princess had just embarked on an affair with her Cavalry riding instructor, James Hewitt, after her husband had reignited his long-term relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles. Flush with infatuation for the dashing Lothario, who would later betray her in a tell-all book, sexuality oozed from every pore. ‘It’s a sexy, figure-hugging piece,’ says the Mail’s style editor Dinah van Tulleken. ‘All-over sequinned fabrics are not the most forgiving, but Diana didn’t need to worry.’ The glittering dress was first snapped up at auction by a mystery woman from Florida, who sold it on in 2013 for £90,000. Power dressing in pink Catherine Walker, 1987 It’s the Disney-esque fairytale gown every little girl dreams of wearing, complete with elegant sleeves and a full, flowing ballgown skirt. In delicate rose pink, of course. And yet, as pink and princessy as this Catherine Walker dress is, Diana looks far from powerless or fragile in it. Its white, raw silk collar drops seductively from the shoulders to display an almost daring amount of decolletage, while its matching cuffs mirror the buttons on the structured waist to hint cheekily at a man’s classic tuxedo while accentuating her long, lean torso. The Disney-esque fairy tale dress of every little girl's dreams - complete with elegant sleeves and a full ballgown skirt. Right, Diana in the dress at a Gala Performance by the Royal Ballet at the Berlin Opera House, Germany The grandeur of the satin evening gown — sold in 1997 for £20,000 — was entirely deliberate as it was made for the princess to wear for an official portrait by Terence Donovan alongside her husband in 1987. It was a delicate moment in the couple’s marriage: both had by now taken other lovers and Diana, although never entirely relinquishing the torch she carried for her husband, was also beginning to find an inner strength she never knew she possessed. No longer would ‘Shy Di’ play second fiddle to Charles; this was a woman who knew her own worth — and wanted a dress that would hold its own next to her husband’s elaborate ceremonial uniform. Diana loved it so much that she wore it in public on four separate occasions, the first time being for a night out at the Berlin Opera House during an official visit to Germany in November 1987 (main picture). The distance between her and Charles was very much in evidence as they walked down the red carpet, several feet apart. As if to emphasise the gulf, Diana held her hands behind her back and dipped her head coyly, showing off the elegance of her shoulders, as well as her trademark pearl necklace and earrings. Blouse that sparked a style craze Emanuel, 1981 Diana’s memorable ‘engagement portrait’ was, in truth, an accident of fate. The picture, taken by the late Lord Snowdon, was originally commissioned as part of a Vogue feature on ‘upcoming beauty’, and had been facilitated by her elder sisters, Sarah and Jane, who had both worked for the title. Diana walked into the shoot and, faced with a rail of clothes, made a beeline for this blouse with its distinctive satin neck ribbon. It was made by the then-unknown young husband and wife design duo, David and Elizabeth Emanuel. Fortuitously for Vogue — and the Emanuels — the timing of the publication coincided with the announcement of Lady Diana Spencer’s engagement to the Prince of Wales. The picture that became Diana's engagement portrait was taken by the late Lord Snowdon, and originally commissioned as part of a Vogue feature on ‘upcoming beauty’ In a matter of days, the young aristocrat’s comfortable world had exploded, making her choice of the delicate shell-pink blouse, which emphasised her fragile beauty, all the more poignant. Quickly dubbed ‘Lady Di’ blouses as the nation fell in love with their new princess-to-be, pie-crust collars and pussy-bows became the height of fashion, and thousands of imitations promptly sold out on the High Street. Diana loved its makers so much that she famously asked the Emanuels to design her wedding dress. And she remained loyal to them, even after an over-sized green and black tweed coat they made for her was dubbed ‘the horse blanket’ by the international media. Mail style editor Dinah van Tulleken, says Diana’s iconic blouse would still be the height of fashion today. ‘Statement collars and pussy-bow details are back for 2017, and this eye-catching design could be straight off the Gucci catwalk,’ she says. Going in alone - the vamp in Versace Atelier Versace, 1997 As Princess of Wales, Diana had adopted the royal tradition of wearing clothes by British designers, and throughout her time as a working princess she stuck faithfully to a trusted coterie of upper-crust couturiers, such as Bruce Oldfield and David Sassoon. But following her separation from Prince Charles, Diana decided to experiment with international labels. It was a small but significant sign of her growing independence. Made from elaborate beaded silk, it’s a stunning example of the new, sexually confident princess, who was experimenting with international labels Diana on the cover of Bazaar, having divorced away her HRH title, and right, one of the staff members with the dress she wore on the front cover As she once said of her introduction to royal dressing: ‘I couldn’t have fashionable clothes because it wouldn’t have been practical for the job, but I had to have clothes that had to last all day long, sensible colours and sensible neckline and skirt length.’ Now, controversially stripped of her HRH post-divorce, Diana rose like a phoenix from the ashes of her royal life in this body-skimming, embellished ice-blue number by Italian designer Gianni Versace, which cleverly leaves just the right amount of flesh on show. Made from elaborate beaded silk, it’s a stunning example of the new, sexually confident princess — as this 1997 cover photo for Harper’s Bazaar, shot by fashion favourite Patrick Demarchelier shows. ‘The simplicity of this image, with its understated hair and make-up and lack of jewellery, means it hasn’t dated. And it’s a stunning dress that wouldn’t look out of place on the catwalks today,’ says the Mail’s style editor Dinah van Tulleken. ‘Your eye is drawn to the low-cut neckline which is embellished with turquoise and gold studs, pyramids and faceted glass. It’s a silk dress with silk lining — exquisite and now iconic. A one-of-a-kind haute-couture piece.’ A latter-day Grace Kelly in blue chiffon Catherine Walker, 1987 Diana loved going to the movies — Hollywood blockbusters and rom-coms were always favourites — and would often visit her local cinema on Kensington High Street disguised with a scarf and an over-sized pair of glasses. Sometimes she also took fashion inspiration from the movies. For this strapless dress, by designer Catherine Walker, she looked to Grace Kelly’s gown in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1955 classic To Catch A Thief. Made from the palest of blue silk chiffon, the floor-length bandeau gown and matching scarf were premiered, appropriately, at the Cannes Film Festival of 1987 then worn again two years later at a performance of Miss Saigon in London. Made from the palest of blue silk chiffon, the floor-length bandeau gown and matching scarf were premiered, at the Cannes Film Festival of 1987 then worn again two years later at a performance of Miss Saigon in London Its flattering draped and tucked bodice highlighted the princess’s long torso and tiny waist and, by using a clever crossover to pull her in at her thinnest point, Walker also managed to exaggerate her modest bust. Diana showed her knack for old-school Hollywood glamour by including a fabulously elegant scarf and shoulder-dusting sapphire earrings, completing the look with matching satin heels. Diana loved the dress’s flowing lines so much that she also wore it for an official portrait by Terence Donovan, now sitting in the National Portrait Gallery. That picture tells us so much about Diana’s state of mind at the time: intoxicated by handsome Army officer James Hewitt, a newly buxom Diana brings a sexually charged confidence to an outwardly demure dress after finding a new man to ‘love and adore’. Shortly after the portrait was taken, she wrote to Hewitt saying: ‘If by any chance you want to get in touch for whatever, the B.P [Buckingham Palace] switchboard will know exactly where I am even if I don’t . . . it has been known.’ The gown was bought for £47,000 at auction in 1997. Shimmering in red velvet Catherine Walker, 1990 By now a master of what worked for the cameras, Diana ensured that this burgundy silk-velvet evening dress, with its embroidered tail coat, photographed beautifully from every angle. It was worn here to the premiere of the film Steel Magnolias in Leicester Square in 1990, and then again on a state visit to South Korea in 1992. The simple column dress has a seductive slit at the back, while the slightly masculine tailored jacket is softened with exquisite, floral embroidery. It’s a bold look, so Diana was wise to choose accessories in the same colour. Diana ensured that this burgundy silk-velvet evening dress, with its embroidered tail coat, photographed beautifully from every angle Altogether, it’s easy to see why this is the perfect example of the type of dress Walker said she wanted to create for the princess. Dresses regal enough to satisfy her adoring public, but ones that Diana, the woman, would also enjoy wearing. ‘People think they know these dresses, but it isn’t until you see them close up that you understand the level of craftsmanship that has gone into them,’ says exhibition curator Eleri Lynn. ‘They are made for the cameras.’ There is a noticeable sense of contentment to Diana here: she had started to conquer the eating disorders that plagued the early years of her marriage and make private visits to hostels for the homeless, exploring new avenues of her public work. She had even, according to her biographer Andrew Morton, found the confidence to challenge her rival, Camilla, over her rekindled relationship with Charles, telling her: ‘Don’t treat me like an idiot, I know what’s going on.’ The only dress she owned when she got engaged Regamus, 1979 One of the princess’s earliest forays into fashion, Regamus was a label beloved by aristocratic mothers and their debutante daughters alike. Although the young Lady Diana Spencer didn’t take part in any formal debutante presentations herself, she wore this dress to a ball at her family seat, Althorp House, in 1979. The blue gown has a nylon net lace overlay with velvet ribbon detail and a matching scarf — it’s a good example of Diana’s early love of flounces and frills. Princess Diana,in the drawing-room at Althorp House, wearing an off the shoulder dress which was the only one she owned, in 1979, left, and right, the dress on display as part of the exhibition It was one of just three items of clothing Diana claimed to own when she got engaged to Charles — everything else she borrowed from her friends and flatmates. She recalled: ‘I literally had one long dress, one silk shirt, one smart pair of shoes and that was it. Suddenly my mother and I had to go out and buy six of everything.’ Diana and her mother, Frances Shand Kydd, found this gown in the ‘French Room’ at Harrods — which featured high-end ready-to-wear looks inspired by Parisian couture — during a last-minute shopping trip before the ball. Captured by a photographer poring over a magazine shortly before the party started, it perfectly encapsulates the virginal innocence of the young Lady Di on the cusp of womanhood. ‘Diana soon learned that ruffles and frills didn’t create the right impression, but this Regamus ball gown from 1979 is innocent, young, feminine and flirty,’ says Mail style editor Dinah van Tulleken. ‘The lace detail adds volume to the bust, while the belt detail is a very obvious attempt to create an hourglass shape on a young frame. ‘There’s no coincidence with the colour: blue can symbolise truth, peace and virtue.’ Mismatched gloves that meant mischief Murray Arbeid, 1986 This flamenco-style dress, with its distinctive red taffeta skirt, by Murray Arbeid was another daring choice for the Princess of Wales — not least because she wore it with one black and one red evening glove, causing a media furore. Even the gloves were risque; nylon and elasticated costume numbers that she picked up on the High Street, as opposed to handcrafted by the traditional royal makers. The flamenco style dress was a daring choice for the Princess of Wales, who was only 25, and already a mother twice over It is easy to forget, that although she was Princess of Wales and a mother twice over, Diana was still only 25. With her often mischievous sense of humour (not always appreciated by the more staid members of Royal Family), she enjoyed putting her own little twist on things. Here, at the premiere of The Mission in London in October 1986, one of several occasions it got an outing, Diana chose to embellish its black velvet bodice with a Maltese Cross brooch made by trendy costume jewellers Butler & Wilson of London. Another time she chose to emphasise her bare shoulders and swan-like neck with a velvet choker — again a cheap trinket, rather than borrowed royal jewels. Oozing style in an off-duty shift dress Catherine Walker, 1997 After her separation from Charles, Diana developed a sleek, simplified, executive-style wardrobe that suited both her public and her private personas. It was the outward display of Diana’s determination to be known ‘not as a clotheshorse but a workhorse’. ‘She realised that in order for people to take her seriously she needed to dress down,’ says exhibition curator Eleri Lynn. The shift dress was a determined statement from Diana that she was a workhorse, not a clotheshorse. She developed a distinctive uniform for a working mum She developed a distinctive uniform, suitable for a chic, working mum based around simple shift dresses and jackets, many by Catherine Walker. ‘Diana exuded a kind of executive sleekness.’ says Eleri. ‘And certain things she did moved away from royal protocol. She stopped wearing gloves because she liked skin-to-skin contact when she shook hands. She didn’t wear hats after a while, because she said you can’t cuddle a child in a hat, and she would wear chunky jewellery so babies would have something to play with.’ Interestingly, this dress is the only one on display that she did not wear to an official event. Instead, she wore this simple but exquisitely cut blue shift dress for a shopping trip on Bond Street in London in 1997. It had taken 16 years of refining her style, but Diana — in her trademark off-duty cream ballet flats and matching handbag — had now perfected the guise of a well-to-do woman about town. Echoing her declaration that she wanted to be known for her work, not the way she looked, Diana now very much dressed the same in public as she did in private. She told biographer Andrew Morton: ‘I like it as normal as possible. Walking along the pavement gives me a tremendous thrill.’ How she gave Charles the bold shoulder Gina Fratini for Hartnell, 1990 Diana loved daring one-shouldered dresses, which showed off her gym-honed torso, even after the style fell out of fashion. Intriguingly, she commissioned a large number of these asymmetrical gowns during the latter years of her by now loveless marriage to Prince Charles. It was as if Diana, two years away from the announcement of their official separation, wanted to prove to the husband she felt had rejected her that she was still a woman to be desired. And desired she was, with a string of male admirers including her close friend James Gilbey, who was unwittingly recorded by an amateur radio ham around this time on the phone to Diana, calling her ‘Squidgy’. Diana loved one-shouldered dresses long after the style went out of fashion, and commissioned several when she was in the final loveless years of her marriage to Charles This striking sari-inspired white silk chiffon gown trimmed with pearlised sequins and beads was first unveiled for a startlingly sexy official portrait by Terence Donovan in 1990. According to another of her favourite designers, David Sassoon, the princess liked to be rebellious in her choice of outfit. ‘She loved the fun of saying: “Oh the press are going to love this”. ‘She absolutely knew certain dresses would cause comment, and she enjoyed that,’ he reveals. Diana loved this dress so much that she also wore it during an evening at the ballet on an official visit to Rio de Janiero, Brazil, in April 1991, as seen here when she is just shy of her 30th birthday. The lines of the dress accentuate her collar bone, while her bronzed, glowing skin is emphasised by her shorter Sam McKnight haircut. The dramatic diamond and sapphire chandelier-style earrings offer a welcome splash of colour. Her accessories have been chosen to enhance the purity of the colour — simple white satin heels and a matching clutch with modern gold bangles. It was sold in the 1997 auction of her dresses for more than £50,000. Suit that hid the honeymoon heartache Bill Pashley, 1981 Memorably worn during an official photocall on her honeymoon at Balmoral, this brown tweed wool suit was actually one of two identical numbers commissioned by Diana. The only difference was the size — and for her honeymoon Diana favoured the larger one as the extra shoulder room allowed her to take part in country activities such as shooting with her new husband. The tweed fabric was very much in keeping with traditional English country dress. For Diana, nervously finding her feet as she joined the Royal Family, it was a chance to explore her blossoming sense of style while still following in the sensible shoes of her mother-in-law, the Queen. The brown tweed wool suit was one of two identical suits commissioned by Diana, and worn during a photocall on her honeymoon in Balmoral In secret tape recordings handed over to author Andrew Morton, Diana said of her honeymoon: ‘Went off to Balmoral … everyone was there to welcome us and then the realisation set in. ‘Charles used to want to go for long walks around Balmoral the whole time when we were on our honeymoon. His idea of enjoyment would be to sit on top of the highest hill at Balmoral … and read Jung to me. [That made him] blissfully happy.’ Diana, however, was already suffering from ‘appalling’ bulimia and had begun to regret bitterly her decision to marry, railing at the Royal Family’s assumption she could adapt to being Princess of Wales overnight. In the end, she returned to London early where she was made to seek psychiatric help after threatening to cut her wrists. The suit is now owned by the Historic Royal Palaces charity, who bought it at auction. Diana: Her Fashion Story opens at Kensington Palace on Friday, February 24. Entry to the exhibition is included in palace admission. For further information and to buy tickets, visit hrp.org.uk/Diana.
