Mophie's solution is efficient and elegant, as the case is small enough to fit in any size bag, but constructed solidly enough to withstand a good thrashing in that bag. The Wireless Charging Car Vent Mount \nAmazon \nIf you drive, it'd be a critical mistake not to have phone-charging equipment in your car. Trust me. But charging can be a bit of a pain if you start using a mophie Juice Pack. \nIt obscures the Lightning connector, so you'll have to plug your case-clad phone into a power source via MicroUSB. Or, you can invest in one of these wireless charging mounts. The concept is simple: place the car mount on a vent in your car, stick your phone to the car mount (it'll latch on magnetically), and you're in business. The Powerstation Plus Mini \nAmazon \nOut of all the batteries mophie sells, the one I have to give the biggest nod to is the powerstation Plus Mini . \nIt's small and light enough to fit in a pocket, and has enough battery capacity to extend the life of your phone for a few hours. \nBut this external battery's best feature is its integrated cable. The cable has tips for both iPhone and Android devices, and fits into a slot in the battery. If you're worried about the cable popping out, don't worry, it's held in its slot via magnets. powerstation Plus Mini External Battery, $59.95, available at Amazon Disclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
