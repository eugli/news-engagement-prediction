It shows that the Tories are on 44% nationwide – up two points since a similar survey two weeks ago – while Labour have moved down one to 26%. \nThe Tories have enjoyed a larger lead in just three polls in this series, which dates back to 1983, said ICM. Two of these came shortly before the 1983 general election, when Michael Foot went down to a crushing defeat at the hands of Margaret Thatcher, and the other at a low-point in Gordon Brown’s premiership in 2008. \nCorbyn was returned as Labour leader for the second time in two years in September, beating a challenge by Owen Smith. The senior party source said Labour had been in the lead in the polls in May last year but has fallen away since last summer’s string of resignations from the shadow cabinet that followed the Brexit vote result, and the subsequent leadership battle. \n“In the last round of local elections in May, Labour was ahead of the Tories by one point,” the source said. “After the leadership challenge and the dissension in the Labour party, that was held back. Ever since the changes in the Tory leadership, the Tories have been in a strong position. \n“But we are confident that won’t continue and Labour’s position will improve in the polls. That kind of gap won’t last.” \nCorbyn believes Labour will bounce back as negotiations over Brexit begin with Europe. “As soon as the government goes to Brussels over Brexit they will be confronted with the reality of 27 countries briefing against it and I think the internal dissension within the Tory party will be exacerbated by that,” the source said. \nThe Copeland byelection, which was called after Labour’s Jamie Reed announced his resignation from the post in December, could fall to the Tories according to Labour sources. \nLabour won the seat in the 2015 general election with a majority of 2,564 over the Conservatives in second place. The bookmakers Paddy Power has made the Conservatives favourite to win in Copeland. \nCorbyn also briefed Labour parliamentarians on plans to expose growing inequality and the “unprecedented” health and social care funding crisis when the chancellor, Philip Hammond, delivers his budget next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:12:07.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
