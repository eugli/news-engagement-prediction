Photo by: Audi \nNow, less than a year later, Europe will receive a hatchback variant called the RS3 Sportback. Photo by: Audi \nDon't count on this one coming to the US, though. Buyers here don't like hatchbacks. Photo by: Audi \nIt packs the same 400-horsepower, 2.5-liter I5 as the RS3 sedan. Photo by: Audi \nThanks to its all-wheel drive, the RS3 Sportback will shimmy itself to 62 mph in just 4.1 seconds. Photo by: Audi \nThe top speed is set at 155 mph, unless you ask for a higher top speed, in which case it'll be 174 mph. Photo by: Audi \nCarbon ceramic brakes are optional. Photo by: Audi \nIt's 1.0 inch lower and 0.8 inches wider than the standard Audi A3 Sportback. Photo by: Audi \nOrder books for the RS3 Sportback open in April. Photo by: Audi \nIt will run you €54,600 ($58,064, directly converted), which is actually €1,300 ($1,382) less than the sedan.
