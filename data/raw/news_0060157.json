The country that Australians want cannot even be imagined from these trenches.\" \nDr Henry contrasted politics today with the policy success of years past, even though the contest then was as \"adversarial and every bit as partisan\". \nIt was a time \"when the tribal tensions within parties were generally well managed and the political contest appeared to energise policy, not kill it\". But over the last decade almost every major infrastructure project had turned into a political fight. \n\"In the most recent federal election campaign, no project anywhere in the nation — not one — had the shared support of the Coalition, Labor and the Greens,\" Dr Henry said. \n\"Every government proposal of the last 10 years to reform the tax system has failed.\" \nThe constant political brawl meant considered, long-term recommendations on fiscal, economic growth and environmental challenges were ignored. \n\"The reform narrative of an earlier period has been buried by the language of fear and anger. It doesn't seek to explain; rather, it seeks to confuse and frighten.\" \nDr Henry warned that research conducted by the NAB showed that Australians were worried about the future, with only one in five believing that the nation had a clear, shared vision. \nBusiness also had to make the case for change and it had to build trust. \n\"All of Australia's business leaders, including in NAB, could talk more openly, with greater conviction, and more inclusively, about the role we see our businesses playing in building a better future for all Australians,\" Dr Henry said. \nHe pointed to four policy challenges that demanded urgent attention and which were critical to building the Australia that Australians want: Budget repair Planning for a strongly growing, but ageing, population Settling a framework for climate change mitigation and energy security Making the most of the Asian century \n\"Australians are calling for their leaders, in politics, in business and in the broader community, to develop a shared commitment to a clear vision for our future,\" Dr Henry said. \n\"It's time to deliver.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:09:52.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
