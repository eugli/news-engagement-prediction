Their refusal to attend is borne out of issues around mental health and anxiety. It's not a matter of won't, but can't. What makes a school refuser? \nEmma finds it hard to talk about some of the reasons she's stayed home since August 2016, but she's determined to try. \nShe wrings her hands and looks away as she fights back tears, quietly revealing the long months of bullying that finally led her to tell her mother that she could no longer face returning to her local high school. \n\"I went to school that day, and it was horrible. I didn't ever go back.\" \nEmma says she struggled with depression and the feeling that her concerns weren't being addressed by teachers and staff, who told her to avoid contact with the students who were preying on her. \nAs many as eight per cent of all young people have refused to attend school due to these kinds of scenarios. \nIn desperation, Emma's mother took her to a psychologist, who referred her to the Travancore School in Melbourne. \nAt Travancore, a pilot program known as In2School has been successful in helping students like Emma and Kate grapple with their fears and return to regular attendance and academic progress. \n\"What I think is different about In2School is they have a transitional classroom and no more than eight young people are incorporated at any one time,\" says Lisa McKay Brown, a former teacher with 25 years' experience, now lecturing in learning intervention at Melbourne's Graduate School of Education. \n\"One of the things [these students] have lost is the routine of going to school, of sleeping overnight, getting up in the morning, getting dressed, having breakfast. So we need to build that back into their processes.\" How transitional schooling works \nOver 12 weeks the students are gradually reintroduced to almost full school attendance. \nThey also engage in regular learning, work with a clinician, and spend a day per week in the community connecting with people and practising independence. \nKate and Emma have become best friends during their time at Travancore. Both are returning to high school full-time in 2017, and though they have some fears, they're determined to make it work. \nEmma's decision to start afresh at a new school helped her overcome the anxiety she had surrounding bullying. \nBut for Kate, the social exclusion and conflict she experienced from her best friends has not deterred her from returning to the same place. \n\"They got mad at me for suddenly not going to school. I wasn't supported by the girls. But I do have guy mates in my class and they were a lot more supportive than the girls I hang around with,\" she says. \n\"I didn't want to start somewhere else. I thought that would make it worse for me. Plus I do think that school was good for my education as I learn pretty well there.\" \nEmma and Kate's mothers, Wendy and Mandy, say their daughters' improvement through In2School couldn't be more welcome. \n\"The program has allowed parents to connect as well and regularly meet to swap stories, and offer support,\" says Wendy. Offering support \nWendy and Emma take turns telling the story of the day Emma refused to attend the program, and their surprise and admiration when the clinician, Leah, drove all the way to their house to pick her up. \n\"To drive from the city, 50 kilometres away, to come and get a child to go school. I think that's fantastic,\" Wendy says. \n\"That's the support these women do for these kids. They'll go out of their way to make them come to school, to help them.\" \nEmma and Kate were part of the third and final intake to complete the In2School program. From that cohort, seven out of eight returned to school this week. \nOverall, the program has had a 91 per cent success rate in getting students back to school, although 14 per cent of them are part time. \nHowever, what happens next is uncertain. Current funding for In2School runs out at the end of February, and there have no funding commitments from the Victorian or federal governments. \nWendy hopes the program will survive, as does Mandy, whose daughter Kate explains: \"Yes there are people out there who can't be bothered with school because it doesn't interest them. \n\"But we have tried this program to get back to school because school does mean something to us and we want to learn. We were having some trouble along the way, then we got the support we needed, so now we can do it.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T16:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:18:11.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
