Her husband is Jewish, and she converted to Judaism years ago. That being said, she emphasized the importance of religious tolerance on Twitter. America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers. #JCC \n— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 20, 2017 googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); });  2'); }); \nHarmless, right?

Not in any capacity. And don’t even bother bringing up the executive order on immigration. That was not a Muslim ban. It affected less than 15% of the world’s Muslims. The order had nothing to do with religion and everything to do with high-risk countries. . @IvankaTrump Seriously #Ivanka ? Are you so tone-deaf, or drowning in hubris, that u don’t realize how disingenuous & ironic this tweet is? \n— Andy Ostroy (@AndyOstroy) February 21, 2017 @IvankaTrump Phony. Fake. Fake.
