John Singleton presented the award to Davis. \nDavis topped Tim Miller for “Deadpool,” Kelly Fremon Craig for “Edge of Seventeen,” Nate Parker for “The Birth of a Nation” and Dan Trachtenberg for “10 Cloverfield Lane.” \nThe Australian director is also competing for the top feature film award along with Damien Chazelle (“La La Land”), Garth Davis (“Lion”), Barry Jenkins (“Moonlight”), Kenneth Lonergan (“Manchester by the Sea”) and Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival”). \n“Lion,” starring Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman and Sunny Pawar, is based on the 2013 book by Saroo Brierly about being separated from his mother in India at the age of 5, being adopted by an Australian family and re-uniting with his family 25 years later. \nAlex Garland won the DGA’s inaugural first-time feature award last year for “Ex Machina.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T11:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T06:03:44.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
