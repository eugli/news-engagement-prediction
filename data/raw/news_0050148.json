He also served as the team's president and general manager.\nIn addition, Quinn, also a former NHL player, held coaching and executive positions with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Edmonton Oilers, Philadelphia Flyers and Los Angeles Kings. Internationally, he guided Canadian Olympic, World Cup, world junior and under-18 teams to gold medals.\nThe sculpture also includes “Pat's Bench” - a facsimile of the spot where Quinn conversed with Canadian Olympic athletes outside of Canada House in Salt Lake City during the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n“It's where Pat loved to be,” said Canucks president Trevor Linden, a former Vancouver captain who took part in the unveiling ceremony. “He loved to be behind the bench.”\nThe statue was created by Norm Williams, who also sculpted a nearby statue that depicts late Canucks coach Roger Neilson waving a white towel on the end of a hockey stick during the 1982 Stanley Cup finals.\nCalgary Flames president Brian Burke, a former Canucks executive who worked under Quinn, was among the participants in the unveiling ceremony, along with former Vancouver players and others.\nA post-secondary scholarship in Quinn's name has also been established for hockey players and other athletes.\nPhotos Late NHL and Canadian men's Olympic hockey team coach Pat Quinn was honoured Saturday with a statue outside the home of the Vancouver Canucks.(CTV News).
