The building, owned by Gart Properties , once was home to a food court, but it has sat mostly empty for more than a decade. \nCity officials see an opportunity to bolster an underdeveloped block that’s across California from a light-rail stop. If Target signs a lease, current plans call for a 28,130-square-foot urban store — much smaller than a normal Target — that would focus on serving the growing ranks of downtown residents and workers, according to city documents. \nThe council, voting 8-1, approved the incentives package for Sixteen Cal LLC, an entity registered to the Gart family.

It would transfer $4 million from this year’s general fund budget contingency to the business incentive fund. \nCouncilwoman Robin Kniech voted no, citing the rarity of using the city’s business incentive fund to support retail jobs that would pay wages below the area’s median, and typically for part-time work. She said a second factor was that the contract was with the landlord, not with Target — providing less assurance that the retailer would stick around in that location. \n“The combination of those two concerns — I just can’t get there,” Kniech said. \nBut council President Albus Brooks, who represents much of downtown, and Councilman Paul López disagreed that retailers shouldn’t be eligible for incentives. Both said the city should use incentives more often for targeted retail purposes, such as attracting grocery stores to Denver’s food deserts. \nIn the Target deal, the city’s arrangement with the landlord sets out a $2 million advance payment for tenant-required improvements upon store opening and up to $2 million more for an operational offset. The latter would come in the form of 50 percent rebates of sales and use taxes generated by the store for up to 20 years. \nAfter that limit is hit, the landlord’s 50 percent split would go toward repaying the city for the $2 million advance payment.
