One parent was heard calling Mack a \"big cheater' (Photo: Facebook) Mack was booed by a small minority of the audience during his last victory (Photo: Facebook) \n\"But she's a fighter. She's not a quitter,\" she said. \n\"Mack wants to wrestle boys and he'll never be recognized as a boy because of the birth certificate in the state of Texas.\" \nThe birth certificate policy was passed by the University Interscholastic League (UIL) last August, with 95 per cent of the vote.
