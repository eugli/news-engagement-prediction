(Photo: Matt_Kryger/Indy_Star) St. John's at Butler, 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, FS1 144 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nINDIANAPOLIS – As a senior at Cincinnati’s Moeller High School, Nate Fowler never missed a moment with his basketball team. Every game, every practice, every film session, every weightlifting workout. \nAs laudable as that might be, other players do likewise. Except for this: Fowler could not play. He broke his foot and was sidelined all season. \n“Had he played his senior year,” Moeller coach Carl Kremer said, “there’s no telling how good he would have been.” \nThe 6-10 Fowler, now in his sophomore season at Butler, is offering glimpses of how good he could become. Although he lacks enough minutes to qualify for national rankings, his offensive rating is higher than any of the 2,100-plus college players listed by kenpom.com. \nHe will try to help the No. 25 Bulldogs end a recent downturn in Wednesday’s Big East game against St. John’s at Hinkle Fieldhouse. \nFowler is coming off Saturday’s 71-65 loss at Providence in which he had career highs in points (19), field goals (seven) and 3-pointers (three). He played nearly as many minutes (23) as he had in Butler’s three previous games combined. \nAs lineups and rotations have changed, Fowler has not. \n“I always approach every game the same way,” he said. “If I play, I play. If I don’t, I don’t. Just deal with it.” \nHe has adjusted to subordinate roles before. His Moeller team featured two other NCAA Division I players, Grant Benzinger (Wright State) and Jack Anton (Elon). From third grade through high school, Fowler played on travel teams with Luke Kennard, Duke's All-American. \nFowler’s summer job was to rebound and set screens. Everyone else on the Cincinnati Knights and later the King James Shooting Stars participated in drills designed for guards, so he did, too. That’s how he developed his 3-point stroke – he is 10-of-16 this season, 62.5 percent. CLOSE Share Coach Chris Holtmann elaborates on upcoming game vs. St. John's. David Woods/IndyStar \nFowler followed two other Moeller graduates, Mike Monserez and Alex Barlow, to Butler. Barlow, now a video assistant under Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens, said he has worked out with Fowler and was confident Butler would be a cultural fit. \n“Butler, historically, has done a really good job of identifying those guys and getting them to come there,” Barlow said. \nFowler had nearly as many points at Providence as he had all of last season (23). He conceded it was “a whirlwind” getting back on the court after missing an entire season. \n“Last year I was nervous any time I would go in,” he said. “This year I’m more used to it and back to the point where I can block out everything.” \nThere was evidence of that Jan. 7 at Georgetown, when he scored the Bulldogs’ final five points in regulation to tie the score in a game won by Butler 85-76 in overtime. Kremer said Fowler is starting to resemble the player he was when healthy. \nDYJ – do your job – has long been part of the Butler ethos, and Fowler has embodied that. He said players on this team bring “their own unique twist,” as he does. \nCoach Chris Holtmann said the Bulldogs have sometimes not been athletic enough nor potent enough offensively to employ a big lineup, thus limiting Fowler’s minutes. Never has he been unprepared, though. \n“Nate loves Butler. He wants Butler to win,” Holtmann said. “I think when your goal is for Butler to win, you’re willing to do whatever role. He’s become a star in his role.” \nConsidering how much Fowler has improved, and that tall players develop later than their peers, that role could increase. For the season, he is averaging 5.2 points while shooting .681 from the field and .793 on free throws. \nIt’s not hard to project him to join Barlow as another of Butler’s Academic All-Americans, preserving that fruitful Moeller-to-Butler pipeline. Fowler, an engineering major, was No. 9 in his high school graduating class. \n“He is one of the highest-quality human beings our program has ever had,” Kremer said. \nAnd one human even the emotionless analytics an embrace. \nCall IndyStar reporter David Woods at (317) 444-6195.

JOHN’S at NO. 25 BUTLER \nTipoff: 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, Hinkle Fieldhouse. \nTV: FS1. \nRadio: WFNI-107.5 FM. \nSTORYLINES \n>> Butler (19-6, 8-5) was a No. 4 seed in last week’s preliminary bracket released by the NCAA tournament selection committee. With three losses in four games, the Bulldogs will have to regroup to be in consideration for what would be their highest seed ever. Freshman guards Marcus LoVett (17.3) and Shamorie Ponds (17.2) have led a resurgence by St. John’s (12-14, 6-7). \n>> In the teams’ first meeting, St. John’s overcame a 10-point deficit to beat Butler 76-73 on Dec. 29. Tyler Wideman scored a career-high 20 points. \n>> In 13 Big East games, Butler scoring leader Kelan Martin has had more than 15 points just twice. In last week’s two road games, he totaled nine points on 3-of-14 shooting (0-of-5 on 3s). \n>> In three seasons under coach Chris Holtmann, Butler is 21-4 following a loss. \n>> This is the last remaining home game for which tickets are available. Butler games against DePaul (Sunday) and Seton Hall (March 4) are sold out. \n-- David Woods", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:12:37.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
