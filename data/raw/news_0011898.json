Then there was not adequate security or a female security guard, though she was working alone on that floor,\" he said with tears in his eyes. \n\"I was very happy when she got a job in Infosys. But she was not comfortable in Pune and wanted to go to Bengaluru, which was also closer to her home (in Kerala),\" said the Kozhikode-based Raju. \nRasila's murder \nOn Sunday evening, Rasila was assaulted and strangulated by a computer LAN cord by Saikia after she objected to him \"staring\" at her and threatened to lodge a complaint against him. \nSaikia fled from the scene but the Pune Police zeroed in on him from CCTV footage and nabbed him early on Monday morning when he was planning to board a train to his home in Assam. \nRasila's mother expired two years ago while her brother Rijeesh works in the Gulf.
