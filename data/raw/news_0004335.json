Police launched an investigation into the conservative circles believed responsible, aided by closed-circuit cameras, the ANSA news agency said. \nThe posters, written in Roman dialect, also cited the way Francis had \"ignored cardinals,\" a reference to the four cardinals who have publicly asked Francis to clarify whether divorced and civilly remarried Catholics can receive Communion. \nFrancis hasn't responded directly, though he has made it clear he favors case-by-case allowances. \nOne of the four cardinals is Raymond Burke, a conservative American whom the pope removed as the Vatican's supreme court judge in 2014 and named to be his liaison with the Knights of Malta. Burke, a staunch defender of Catholic doctrine on sexual morals, has become Francis' most vocal critic and was instrumental in the Knights' saga.

After learning that the ouster had been done in his name, Francis effectively took over the order. He asked Festing to resign, restored Boeselager to his position, declared all the Knights' sovereign decisions on the matter \"null and void\" and appointed Becciu to help run the order temporarily. \nBecciu's mandate as the pope's \"exclusive spokesman\" with the order now confirms Burke's marginalization. \nRelated: Pope Warns That Rising Populism Could Produce a New Hitler \nIn his letter Saturday, Francis said Becciu would work in \"close collaboration\" with the No. 2 official who technically is in charge at the Knights. \nThe Knights are a unique organization: An aristocratic lay religious order that traces its history to the Crusades, the order runs a vast humanitarian organization around the world involving over 100,000 staff and volunteers. The order also enjoys sovereign status and has diplomatic relations with over 100 countries, the Holy See included.
