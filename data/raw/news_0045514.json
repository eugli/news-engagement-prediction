Washington’s Metro goes straight to Reagan National with a stop at Dulles on its way. Heck, Atlanta provides a one-seat ride to Hartsfield-Jackson, the busiest air hub in the world. \nOverseas, our international competitors from London and Frankfurt in Europe to Tokyo to Shanghai in Asia all have direct rail links from airports to the city center. \nBut New York City, fugheddaboudit. \nJust look at the pitiful spectacle of LaGuardia — so close to Manhattan, yet so far from travelers’ reach — and listen to a telling slip of the tongue from Gov. Cuomo. \nPreviewing his $10 billion JFK rebuild last month, he boasted for good measure of his plans for LaGuardia, including a brand-new AirTrain “for that one-seat ride coming into Manhattan.” \nHe is indeed pushing a LaGuardia AirTrain — but it would offer a ride between the terminals and remote Willets Point, where the No. 7 subway and Long Island Rail Road have stops. The Port Authority last week set aside $1.5 billion and has put out a request for proposals. \nStop the runaway train right here. \nA true one-seat ride from city center is what is needed, not a people mover requiring travelers to make a taxing transfer. \nThe governor’s AirTrain plan further forces airport-bound passengers from Manhattan to first bypass LaGuardia and then double back, perversely approaching the airport from the east. \nLuckily, a better, direct alternative has already been heavily studied: Cuomo can and should extend the MTA’s N train subway line, which now ends in Astoria, to the airport. Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Queens Borough President Claire Shulman got the MTA to fund it, only to see the project shelved after 9/11. Cuomo, a Queens boy himself, should take it off the shelf. \nSome in Astoria object to running the elevated subway a bit further, and it would also involve dealing with City Hall, no doubt a downside for the current occupant of the governor’s mansion. \nNeither of which justifies blocking the best course. \nOnce, master builder Robert Moses would plow under anything in the way of one of his projects. Cuomo, so eager to avoid any opposition, has veered here to the other extreme, plotting his meandering people mover along a route guaranteed to offend no property owner. That’s no way to build a railroad. \nGetting the subway extended will take years. Until then, Cuomo must have the MTA run the Q70 LaGuardia Link bus to the subway free — as it’s doing this holiday weekend and did over the Christmas holiday. The free transfer should become permanent. \nThe MTA loses no revenues on the runs since the bus only makes one stop on its seven-minute trip: The Roosevelt Ave./74th St. subway station, one of the busiest in the system, where all passengers pay a full MetroCard fare to catch the No. 7, E, F, M and R trains. \nInstead of paying for the bus and getting a free transfer to the subway, ride the bus first and then pay. It’s the same difference, only much easier at the airport end. \nIt’s a good, simple and direct idea. Just like extending the subway to LaGuardia.
