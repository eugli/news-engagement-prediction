It his 17th of the season, and Cousins will be suspended for the second time this season for technical foul accumulation if it is not rescinded by the league office. Thus, can’t blame the man for demonstratively pleading with officials to review the play when he was on the receiving end of unnecessary action. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:00:40.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
