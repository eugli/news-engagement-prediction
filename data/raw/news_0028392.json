The Galaxy S7 is receiving the firmware version G930FXXU1DQB7 while the update for the Galaxy S7 Edge is labeled as G935FXXU1DQB7. Apart from fixing some previously identified vulnerabilities of the Android operating system, these updates are allegedly also packed with some stability improvements and performance optimizations. The latest security patch for the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge is being pushed out as an over-the-air (OTA) update, so if you’re feeling impatient, it’s possible to check for the update manually by opening your Settings app, selecting “About device,” and tapping the “System updates” option. \nAs Samsung started pushing out the new Android Security Update earlier today, the patch will presumably be available worldwide soon, probably by the end of the week. Note that the February Security Update for the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge is based on Android Nougat, so you’ll have to make sure you’re running the latest major iteration of Android before you can download it. Naturally, if the Nougat update still hasn’t rolled out in your territory and you aren’t comfortable with flashing your device, there’s not much you can do but wait. \nEarlier this week, Samsung already released the February Security Update for the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy A3, Galaxy A8, and the Galaxy J5 (2016). Prior to that, the South Korean tech giant updated the Galaxy J5 Prime and the Galaxy J7 Prime in early February. Given those latest developments, it seems likely that more Samsung-made devices will receive their Android Security Updates in the coming days. Apart from optimizing Google’s security patches for its devices, Samsung is also currently preparing for the upcoming Mobile World Congress that’s starting later this month. The Seoul-based phone maker is likely going to arrive at the Barcelona-based trade show with a number of new devices. Unfortunately, the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus won’t be among them as Samsung previously confirmed its upcoming flagship duo will be unveiled at a later date, with recent rumors suggesting that date is March 29.
