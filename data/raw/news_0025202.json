Next on the list of title winners is Chelsea with four, demonstrating the importance of Fergie's influence. \nSince then United have struggled to return to title winning form under David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and most recently under Jose Mourinho. \nBut following Saturday's 2-nil victory over Watford, United are the first team to win 2000 points in the Premier League setting a landmark achievement. 2000 - @ManUtd are the first team to win 2000 points in the @premierleague . Landmark. - OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) February 11, 2017 \nSo since 1992 United have totted up 1997 points, that's roughly 81 points per season (based on 24.5 seasons of the Premier league to date). \nJust to put an exclamation mark on how impressive the points total is their closest rivals in the all time Premier League record is Arsenal but the Gunners are 203 points short of the top spot. \nChelsea are in third place another 39 points behind Arsenal and Liverpool are a further 105 points behind the Blues in the all time Premier League record. \nOf course football started a long time before 1992 and the all time top tier table for English football reads slightly differently. \nOn that table Liverpool lead the way, despite not winning the league in 27 years, on 5483 points. Arsenal are again second on 5445 points followed by Everton on 5266 and then United on 5226. \nMeanwhile, Jose's charges momentarily took fifth place until Liverpool beat Spurs in the late kick-off, as they head back to sixth with the Europa League tie against Saint-Etienne next on their agenda.
