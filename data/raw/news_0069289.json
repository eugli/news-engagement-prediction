The d-day is gradually coming and my aim is to score goals for my club and hope we can win the league”. \nAfter scoring a total of 39 goals in 100 appearances for Watford, the former Granada star forward, will feel confident that he can do better in the Chinese Super League, which is still at its infancy level. \nWith fewer top-level competitors playing in the Chinese Super League, Ighalo, who is one of the stand-out foreigner strikers snapped up during the transfer market, may end up just surpassing his modest expectations if things work according to plans. \nAnd his club, Changchun Yata, may well be ready to splash out more cash on a player, whose football journey is only just picking up.
