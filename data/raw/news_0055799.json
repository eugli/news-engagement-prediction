In interviews, CEO Dan T. Cathy has critiqued gay-rights supporters who ‘have the audacity to define marriage’ and said they are bringing ‘God’s judgment’ upon the nation. \n“I firmly believe that men should be able to marry men, and women women. I am passionately against anyone who would try to suppress this basic human right,” she continued. “I am donating every dime that I make from that ad to Lambda Legal, the largest national legal organization working to advance the civil rights of LGBTQ people, and everyone living with HIV.” \nMs. Slick insisted that making the donation was her plan all along, and that she wasn’t just making the gesture to “cover [her] ass.” \n“From the moment I agreed to license the song, I knew I wanted to set an example for other artists,” she wrote. “I wanted to tell them, ‘Your art will survive and thrive. Do not let it be used by companies who support intolerance. Don’t be afraid to take a stand. You’re an artist; that’s what we do.’ \n“I hope more musicians will think about the companies that they let use their songs; we can use our gifts to help stop the forces of bigotry,” she concluded. “Nothing’s gonna stop us now.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:43:14.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
