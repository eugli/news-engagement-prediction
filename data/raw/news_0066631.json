Porter resident Ruth \"Babe\" Poparad, 95, is a crossing guard and a lifelong Democrat and Methodist. (Jeff Manes / Post-Tribune) \n\"Hope springs eternal in the human breast; \n\"Man never is, but always to be blessed: \n\"The soul, uneasy and confined from home, \n\"Rests and expatiates in a life to come.\" \nâ€” Alexander Pope \nBeing a die-hard Chicago White Sox fan, it was a thrill several years ago when I interviewed Ron Kittle, the American League 's 1983 Rookie of the Year . More recently, I interviewed activist and artist Thomas Frank of East Chicago. It was difficult not typing his name Frank Thomas because of the former Sox first baseman and member of baseball's Hall of Fame. Now, I have interviewed Ruth \"Babe\" Poparad. \nWho's next? Aaron Henry? \nPoparad is a 95-year old crossing guard who looks and gets around like she's 65. She also is a lifelong Democrat and Methodist who lives on four acres in Porter. It is part of the property her parents owned. When scheduling our interview over the telephone, I told her to write down the exact time and date so she wouldn't forget. Babe let me know she didn't have to write it down. \n*** \nTell me about your childhood. \n\"I remember when Cloverleaf Dairy out of Gary would pick up the eight-gallon cans of milk here,\" she said. \"My dad was a dairy farmer. He had 24 head of cattle and one bull. I was the only one of five girls who learned how to milk. My mother used to sew special gloves with one finger and a thumb so we could husk corn. \n\"My father also worked for the state, but he was killed in 1936 while mowing along Highway 20. I was 13. He asked my mom that morning: 'Edith, what if I don't come home today?' She told him: 'I'll live with the kid who treats me the best.' You see, a man who was working two jobs fell asleep at the wheel and hit my father, breaking his neck. He was driving a physician's supply truck.\" \nThat had to be tough on the entire family. \n\"Yeah, the state didn't pay my mother anything when my dad was killed. Before his death, Dad helped build The Spa with horses pulling slip scrappers, but he wasn't allowed to go there once the job was complete because he wore bib overalls. The Spa was a ritzy place that would employ colored folks from Michigan City who would wear black bowties, white shirts and aprons.\" \nDid your mother remarry? \n\"Yes. He got killed one year after she married him. He fell off a ladder and broke his neck.\" \nAny more memories of the Great Depression? \n\"I know my mother and father suffered with six kids. I remember eating lard and sugar sandwiches. I consider Franklin Delano Roosevelt a great president. He got us through hard times.\" \nEducation? \n\"I went to the 8th grade.\" \nIs Poparad your married name? \n\"Yes, my late husband was Romanian. My maiden name is Shultz without a 'c.' One of my parents spoke high German and the other low German.\" \nThat's quite a garden plot you have out there. Before you know it, you'll have your hands in the soil planting vegetables. \n\"My daughter-in-law and I canned 100 jars of tomato juice last year. We grow everything: peppers, cucumbers, beans, pumpkins, watermelons... . Oh, are those melons sweet. You can't buy them like that at the grocery store.\" \nHow's your health? \n\"I'm hardly ever sick. Knock on wood. My son asked me if I wanted the flu shot. I told him I've never had a flu shot and I don't intend on ever getting a flu shot. I used to drink Old Style beer, but I recently quit. I just drink water now. I smoked corn silk as a kid, but it didn't appeal to me.\" \nHow long have you been a crossing guard? \n\"For 33 years. They built me a little weather canopy about five years ago. I get there about 7:15 in the morning and I go back at 2 p.m.\" \nHave you had any close calls while serving as a crossing guard? \n\"Three times. I told one guy from Chicago: 'Don't you know what this sign says? It says STOP!.' I turned my sign around and asked him: 'You know what this side of the sign says? STOP!' Some people are stupid.\" \n*** \nAs a girl, she milked cows twice a day. As a nonagenarian, she ensures the safety of little ones twice a day. \nCome April, the crack of bats meeting baseballs and the trill of robin red breast will be heard across much of this land. The spears of wild asparagus will pop up along railroad tracks and fence lines. By Memorial Day, Babe will be on her hands and knees setting in tomato plants. \nThere's something poetic about all that. \nHope springs eternal.
