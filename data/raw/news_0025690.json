The socialist regime has continued to fail their people in every way imaginable. Thousands of natives are forced to stand in lines for necessities like food and medicine. In January the first infant death from starvation in Venezuela this year was reported . Citizens have had to take measures including the consumption of dogs, cats, and exotic animals in an extreme attempt to survive.

He found the remains of 8 pink birds, believed to be flamingos, with their breasts and torsos sliced out in a marshy area of western Venezuela. Over the last few months, he has identified at least 20 different occasions where Venezuelan’s have been so hungry they have resorted to killing flamingos for food. \nFlamingos are a protected species in Venezuela, making hunting the bird illegal. What is even more interesting is that flamingo meat is not something people would normally eat unless they were in a dire situation.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, dozens have been killed for food as Venezuelans desperately try to feed themselves and their families. \nAccording to sanitation workers, there is more evidence of hunger-driven desperation found in the city’s dump: dismembered dogs, cats, donkeys, horses and pigeons have been found within last year, all skinned or plucked, with signs of having been eaten. \nRobert Linares, who works in waste disposal at the dump said, “Sometimes we only find the animal’s heads, guts and legs. We used to see this very little in the past, but this practice is now out of control and on the rise.” \nA day earlier, he said, he’d found the remains of a dog, skinned and dismembered on the streets of Santa Lucia.

Inflation has reached 700%, 87% of the people don’t have enough food to feed their families, and 60% of the trash cans are looted for food scraps. Venezuelans have also given their starvation a nickname, “the Maduro diet.” (RELATED: Don’t get caught without a backup survival food supply .) \nUnfortunately, most Venezuelans feel they cannot form any opposition to the dictator because he controls what little food supply they have. Maduro knows food is a weapon, and he is using it against the Venezuelan people. When a population is starving and desperate, they are much easier to manage and control giving Maduro all the ammunition he needs to keep himself in power for many generations to come. \nSources:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:25:49.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
