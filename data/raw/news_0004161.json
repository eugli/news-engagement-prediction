Canadian flag. (photo credit:REUTERS) \nA Canadian trade school has rescinded its policy of not accepting Israeli students after outcry from the global Jewish community.Israeli Stav Doron had applied to study at the Island School of Building Arts, a Canadian trade school specializing in wood construction and design located on Gabriola Island in the province of British Columbia, yet was denied admission on the basis of his nationality. Engineering student says Canadian school rejected him for being Israeli Following reports on the matter, the school received a number of inquiries from Jewish groups and individuals, including Canada's Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) and B'nai Brith Canada, demanding clarification and a retraction of the discriminatory policy.The school published a retraction on its website: “After significant thought and listening to all interested parties, ISBA has decided to rescind any restriction placed on accepting students from Israel and apologize for any impact or inconvenience. ISBA remains acceptance to all and will continue to do so without restrictions.”Michael Mostyn, Chief Executive Officer of B’nai Brith Canada said he was pleased with the speedy resolution.“The fact that an educational institution in Canada would have the temerity to hold such a discriminatory policy is outrageous,” he added. “The school’s immediate reversal, when confronted with the truth of its actions, only illustrates the immorality of anti-Israel bias.”According to copies of emails received by The Jerusalem Post on Tuesday, Daron had been in correspondence with Patricia Rokosh, the ISBA's manager of the school and student services, since February.However, when the time came to sign up for the course, Rokosh wrote back to Daron on January 25 that the school is \"not accepting applications from Israel.\" She said the reason was \"due to the conflict and illegal settlement activity in the region.\"Daron responded to Rokosh that \"It's really sad to hear that a place that takes pride in taking students from across the world would behave like this.\"Rokosh wrote back in response that \"It is sad that decisions being made halfway around the world impact us here as we have had a number of students from Israel attend the school in the past.\"The email continued: \"This is a question of staying in line with our moral compass, which will always be important to us. We are still inclusive and cannot support that which is not inclusive.\"In his final email to the school, Daron wrote that \"not taking applications from Israeli students just because they are from Israel is racism, which is basically what you are protesting against.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T17:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:37:32.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
