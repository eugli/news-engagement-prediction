Likewise, the new LG X power2 is also designed to be battery-first, thanks to an included 4,500 mAh capacity battery. In addition, LG notes the combination of battery and the display make this smartphone an ideal option for “ power-heavy multimedia user and gaming enthusiasts ”. Although LG has now announced the new smartphone, the company has stated that it will get an official unveil and will be on show during MWC 2017 . \nAccording to LG, the concept behind the X power2 was to bring to market a device which can be used “ for an entire weekend without recharging ” and as such, LG claims that the X power2 is capable of 15 hours of continuous video playback before needing to be recharged again. When it does need to be recharged, LG notes that a half charge (50-percent) can be obtained in one hour, with a full charge achievable in two hours. In terms of the specs, the LG X power2 comes equipped with a 5.5-inch HD display. Inside, it seems there will be more than one RAM variant available, with one sporting 1.5GB RAM and the other sporting 2GB RAM. Both variants come equipped with 16GB internal storage and both are powered by a 1.5 GHz octa-core processor. In terms of cameras, the LG X power2 comes packing a 13-megapixel rear camera along with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. Additional features include microSD card support (up to 2TB), the already-mentioned 4,500 mAh battery, and Android 7.0 (Nougat) out of the box. \nIn terms of availability, LG has yet to confirm exact pricing or release dates, but has said the smartphone will become available some time in March. LG has also confirmed that the LG X power2 will be available in Latin America first, and then in “ key markets ” including the United States, Asia, Europe, and other regions. Lastly, LG has confirmed that the LG X power2 will be available in a variant of colors including Black Titan, Shiny Titan, Shiny Gold and Shiny Blue, as shown above and below.
