John and Dave Chernin have a very clear vision of what this show is, and they execute on that vision each week to perfection. We really couldn’t be happier with THE MICK, and we’re so thrilled to renew the series for a second season.” \nDelivering an average Multi-Platform audience of eight million viewers, The Mick is a comedy about an unapologetic degenerate (Kaitlin Olson) who suddenly finds herself stuck raising her spoiled niece (Sofia Black-D’Elia, The Night Of ) and nephews (Thomas Barbusca, Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life ; newcomer Jack Stanton) in affluent Greenwich, CT. It’s pretty much everything she never wanted. Regardless, she’s determined to rise to the occasion and transform these little monsters into honest, hard-working, decent members of society – something she knows absolutely nothing about. The series also stars Carla Jimenez ( Last Man Standing ) and newcomer Scott MacArthur. \nProduced by 20th Century Fox Television, The Mick was created/written by John Chernin and Dave Chernin of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia . The Chernin brothers, Nicholas Frenkel and Oly Obst, along with Randall Einhorn, who directed the pilot episode, are executive producers. Kaitlin Olson is a co-executive producer on the series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:49:01.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
