Something everyone should live by,\" Spears wrote in the caption of an Instagram photo showing Psalm 126:5, which reads, \"Those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy.\" A post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Feb 16, 2017 at 12:49pm PST Spears, 35, also posted a Throwback Thursday shot of herself holding one of her sons. \"Found this today and realized I'm a very blessed and lucky mommy,\" she wrote. A post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Feb 16, 2017 at 9:35am PST Her messages come at a time when the pop diva is back on top after years of controversy. On February 16, 2007, Spears was in the middle of a bitter custody battle with her ex, Kevin Federline, when she walked into Esther's Haircutting Studio in Tarzana, California, and asked the owner, Esther Tognozzi, to shave off her hair. When Tognozzi refused, Spears picked up a buzzer and shaved her head herself. WATCH: Britney Spears Skips the GRAMMYs to Lounge Oceanside in a Sexy Bikini Trouble continued to follow Spears. In January 2008, Federline was awarded sole legal and physical custody of their two children, Sean and Jayden, while Spears' visitation rights were suspended. Spears was placed under a temporary conservatorship in February 2008, one month after the high-profile breakdown landed the then-26-year-old in an involuntary psychiatric hold (or \"5150 hold,\" as it's also known) at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Eight months later, her father, Jamie Spears, and lawyer, Andrew Wallet, became her official, full-time co-conservators.

Last year, her ninth album, Glory , was lauded as her best in nearly a decade. And today, the GRAMMY winner continues to perform her Las Vegas residency show while spending her free time with her 10 and 11-year-old sons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:22:29.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
