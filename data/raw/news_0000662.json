the Army spokesperson, Sani Usman, a brigadier-general , hinted that the officers were fired on the grounds of arms procurement fraud and professional misconduct in the 2015 elections. \nBut PREMIUM TIMES uncovered specific reasons given for the compulsory retirement of some of the affected officers, including Mr. Ochankpa, after reviewing court documents filed by the Army at the National Industrial Court in the suit filed by the affected officers. \nMr. Ochankpa, former commanding officer, 343 Air Defence Artillery Regiment , Elele , Rivers State, was accused of partisanship in the 2015 elections. \nHowever, investigations by this newspaper revealed that the Army ignored its own rules in dismissing Mr. Ochankpa and most of the affected officers. \nThey were dismissed without query or indictment by any panel but for reasons that appeared to smack of arbitrariness and witch-hunt by Army authorities. \nAfter the controversial exercise, Mr. Ochankpa and 21 other affected officers separately exploited the window provided by Paragraph 09.02(e) of the Harmonised Terms and Conditions of Service for Officers to petition President Muhammadu Buhari, seeking reinstatement. \nTheir petitions were transmitted to the Presidency in July 2016 by the Chief of Defence Staff. \nSeven months after, none of the petitioners has received response from Mr. Buhari, leaving their fates hanging in the balance. \nMr. Ochankpa died Tuesday while still awaiting presidential action on his appeal.
