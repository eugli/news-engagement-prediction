ROBERT KITCHIN/FAIRFAX NZ \nGreater Christchurch Regeneration Minister Gerry Brownlee said the Government offered $10m in cash and a $15m loan to help restore the cathedral. \nIn December, Stuff reported the Government and Anglican property trustees were unable to agree on the terms of a deal that would see the cathedral in central Christchurch restored. \nREAD MORE: \nOn Friday, Greater Christchurch Regeneration Minister Gerry Brownlee said he was \"surprised and disappointed\" no restoration deal had been made for the earthquake-damaged cathedral. IAIN MCGREGORR/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe Christ Church Cathedral sits decaying just days before the sixth anniversary of the February 2011 earthquake. \nThe Government, he said, offered $10m in cash and a $15m loan to help restore the building. \nBut the Church Property Trustees (CPT) maintains no binding offer was received. \n\"CPT reached an agreement with mandated Crown negotiators including the Christchurch working group chairman Geoff Dangerfield . . . before Christmas,\" Matthews said on Sunday. \n\"That agreement, to CPT's surprise, proved not acceptable to the minister and at the last minute a two page, non-binding, principles document was sent through to the negotiating table. \n\"This two page statement of principles significantly changed the terms in ways that were not acceptable to CPT as prudent trustees, with $42 million to put towards an over $100 million project.\" \nSince then there had been \"very limited informal discussion\". \n\"A revised two page statement of principles, which is non-binding and which I believe has not been seen by Cabinet, arrived this week. \n\"But it was not presented by the Minister, nor did we have assurance he was in favour of every aspect of it,\" Matthews said. \nShe then called the cathedral an \"eyesore\" and \"icon\" in Christchurch. \n\"[It] is not standing as it is today because the church doesn't care. We've tried every which way from Sunday to either have it deconstructed to sill level, or to get help to reinstate it. \n\"Don't think that you're the only ones frustrated,\" Matthews said to a small crowd in Cathedral Square. \nBrownlee said the deal involved Anglicans putting $42m towards the restoration, campaign group Great Christchurch Buildings Trust raising $15m from donors and the Government donating $10m. \nTrustee Moka Ritchie said the CPT had \"never received a binding offer\". \n\"We have waited a long time and worked with everyone who has come to us to try and reach a compromise. \nRoger Bridge, who is a member of the working party to considering options for the Cathedral, expected the stalemate would be solved within the next month. \n\"Nothing's a sure thing, but both parties are working hard with goodwill to try and resolve this problem and find a way forward. \n\"I think everyone's frustrated, both the Government, the church and the people of Christchurch,\" Bridge said. \nA spokeswoman for Brownlee said the Cathedral Working Group had made \"significant efforts\" to achieve a positive outcome for the cathedral and the city. \"In late December, Cabinet approved an offer of support involving a $10m payment towards the cathedral's restoration, a loan facility of up to $15 million, as well as the establishment of a Project Management Office and legislation for consenting of the project. \"That offer was presented to the CPT and negotiations have continued since then,\" she said. Brownlee was under the impression the CPT would meet next week to further discuss the options offered by the government. \"The minister remains disappointed and frustrated that an agreement has not been reached.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:04:33.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
