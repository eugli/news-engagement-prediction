Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., issued a scathing statement citing Gorsuch's stance on assisted suicide, and saying nobody who believes individual rights are \"reserved to the people\" can support his nomination. \nBut if they have long harbored concerns Gorsuch is extreme, they didn't much show it in 2006. \nSchumer, Wyden and many others were in Congress at the time of the unanimous voice vote on July 20 of that year. The record does not reflect who specifically was on the floor for the 95-0 tally, but it would have included most, if not all, of the following Senate members that year: \nFour former top Obama administration officials (President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry) and 12 current Democratic senators (Sens. Schumer, Wyden, Dianne Feinstein, Patrick Leahy, Patty Murray, Dick Durbin, Jack Reed, Bill Nelson, Tom Carper, Debbie Stabenow, Maria Cantwell and Bob Menendez).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:57:40.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
