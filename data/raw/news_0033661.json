I won’t be.” \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday denied the charge that the administration is tracking reporters, but then awkwardly joked about it. \n“That is absolutely not true,” he said at the White House press briefing. “There are no dossiers being kept — just a binder that I put right here. That’s about it.” \n“That was a joke,” he added.

Phillip confirmed Ryan’s account to the Post, saying that Ryan told her after the incident that it could have warranted Secret Service intervention. \nManigault dismissed the story in an email to the Post, writing that it was “fake news!” \nRyan said that last fall, Manigault, with whom she used to be friends, questioned whether she was “a paid Clinton surrogate.” \nManigault has previously claimed that Trump’s team was “keeping a list” of his “enemies,” referring to Republicans who had opposed Trump during his campaign. \n“It’s so great our enemies are making themselves clear so that when we get in to the White House, we know where we stand,” she told the Independent Journal Review at Trump’s victory party in November. “But let me just tell you, Mr. Trump has a long memory, and we’re keeping a list.” Also on HuffPost Newspapers React To President Trump Newspapers React To President Trump 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:11:45.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
