All proceeds are to benefit the wildfire victims in Chile. \nBarbers and hairdressers from around the city donated their time and skills in support of the fundraising campaign. \nA combination of strong winds, high temperatures, and drought sparked one of the worse fires in Chile’s history. \nAcres of land were destroyed by the raging forest fire leaving people without homes. \n“Our goal is a big one. We are planning to get something around $100,000 in Calgary. So this is a campaign we are starting today,” Domingo Bautrand, an organizer, said. \nThe community association will host another haircut fundraising event on March 18 at the Marlborough Community Centre. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:32:13.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
