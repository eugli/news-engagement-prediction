It says withholding those funds would cause “immediate and devastating injury” to county residents. \nA U.S. Justice Department spokesman was not immediately available to comment. The department is due to file a reply to the injunction request by March 9. \n\n© Copyright 2017 by CBS San Francisco and Bay City News Service. All rights reserved.
