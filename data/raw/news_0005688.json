It enables them to be there without being reported to ICE in case of another crime that they might bear witness to.” \nWilkerson pushed back with another devastating question for Pelosi. \n“Will my son’s killer get sanctuary in your city once he’s let out of jail?” she asked. \n“Of course not,” Pelosi responded. She later said her son’s killer should be deported. \nThe Democrat argued the point of sanctuary cities is to prevent law enforcement officers from acting as immigration officers. \nWilkerson’s son, Joshua Wilkerson, was tied up, beaten and strangled to death . His body was then set on fire in a field in Texas. \nAdding insult to his mother’s suffering, his killer, Hermilo Moralez, was brought to the U.S. illegally by his parents when he was a child — but was protected from deportation by Barack Obama’s executive order protecting so-called “DACA” illegal aliens. \nHere is Moralez actually smiling after being booked for the savage murder: \nAnd as for Pelosi’s claim that illegal aliens in sanctuary cities “do not commit crimes”? The utterly clueless Pelosi need only look at her own city of San Fransisco. \nAs TRN has extensively reported , Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal alien while enjoying an evening with her father on the San Franscisco pier in 2015. \nThe man accused of pulling the trigger is 45-year-old Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an illegal alien and repeat felon who had been deported five times. \nWhy was he a free man on the streets? Because San Fransisco PROTECTED him from immigration authorities…refusing to report to ICE that he was here illegally. A “sanctuary” policy Pelosi and her Democrat party support. \nIt is impossible that Pelosi does not know who Steinle was. Not only was she a S.F. resident. \nPresident Trump made Steinle a household name to millions of Americans when, as a candidate, he declared he would punish sanctuary cities if elected as president. And in his first 5 days as president signed an executive order starting that process. \nTrump also ordered the weekly publication of crimes committed by illegal aliens in sanctuary cities so Americans can monitor the crime rates. \nIt was a rare thing indeed for millions of CNN viewers to see how utterly out-of-touch liberals like Pelosi is with the reality of illegal alien crime in America.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:27:41.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
