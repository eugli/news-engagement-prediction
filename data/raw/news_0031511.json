And the team began chanting “Unity!” \n“These kids are doing the right thing,” said Denise Laskody , parent to one of the children on the team. “We don’t have to tell them what to do. They just know. It’s amazing.” \nWatch above, via NJ.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T17:26:34.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
