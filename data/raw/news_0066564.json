Article continues below \nThe likes of Jose Mourinho and Gary Lineker have gone as far as to suggest a statue should have been build of the Italian, or the King Power Stadium should have been named after him. \nLeicester battled relegation before Ranieri's arrival, but during his tenure, they won the Premier League despite being ranked 5000-1 by the bookies and he brought Champions League football to the club - reaching the knockout stages no less - and yet it wasn't enough to save his job. Article continues below Story of fan who missed out on â‚¬34,200 thanks to Leroy Sane has brilliant ending \nThe Foxes do find themselves one point and one place above the relegation zone in England's top-tier and the form guide does not suggest a happy ending to this season. \nPerhaps a change was needed, but did Ranieri deserve more time? The fans certainly seem to think so. \nIn fact, a video released on Friday shows just how popular Ranieri still is with the people of Leicester and while the board might have short memories, the fans do not. \nA woman and her two children brought Ranieri a card to his Leicestershire home to show their sorrow for his demise as their manager. \nThe Italian could have said he did not want to see anyone with the pain of losing his job - and probably relocating his family again - still so fresh. \nBut that's not the Ranieri way. The ex-Chelsea boss posed for pictures with the children with a big smile as he thanked them for their thoughtful gift. \nOnce a man of the people, always a man of the people. \nIt's an unfortunate end to a sensational story, but Leicester have to concentrate on hosting Liverpool on Monday night with their Premier League survival far from certain. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
