(ABC Rural: Cara Jeffery) Cotton crop cops it \nMurrumbidgee grower Ben Dal Broi reported moderate damage occurred in the 100 hectares of cotton growing on his Benerembah property. \n\"We're hoping that we might be able to get away with very light damage at picking, but the thing that concerns me is that should we have another event it could be much more damaging and that would really affect our profitability,\" Mr Dal Brio said. \nHe said the impact of off-target spray drift was much worse on his property this season due to the wet summer and croppers spraying weeds. \n\"People need to be very careful about the conditions they spray under, they need to very careful when they spray at night â€” particularly when there is a temperature inversion as the chemical can drift a long way and affect crops a distance away,\" Mr Dal Broi said. \nHe said it had been a harder season for cotton than the two prior seasons, but still hopes to average 10 bales a hectare. \n\"We had a slower start with the wet winter and it was very difficult to get on the paddocks and get beds up and prepared for sowing,\" he said. \n\"So the cotton was planted later, and then we had some insect damage so we lost some of the fruit. \n\"But since then it has been much warmer and the crop had lifted its head and is powering away.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:13:18.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
