An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Guardian: Social media site Reddit has banned two of the largest far-right \"subreddits\" groups it hosts , altright and alternativeright. The subreddits have been used in the organization of America's resurgent neofascist movement but the final straw for Reddit was the two groups' participation in what is known as \"doxing\": sharing private personal information without permission as a form of online harassment. The subreddits were specifically banned for breaking Reddit's content policy, according to a message posted by the site admins, \"specifically, the proliferation of personal and confidential information.\" Reddit did not make it explicit which content infringed its rules, but it is believed to be attempts to dox the protestor who punched a white nationalist during a TV interview at Donald Trump's inauguration. Speaking to the Daily Beast , one Reddit moderator claimed that the ban was instead a result of its \"record monthly traffic\" (Reddit moderators, like the creators of individual subreddits, are all volunteers with no official relationship to the site's staff). \"It's clear that Reddit banned us because we were becoming very popular and spreading inconvenient truths about who's ruining our country and robbing our children of a future,\" the moderator said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:23:44.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
