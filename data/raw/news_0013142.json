Today the famed jewelry company unveiled a new collection called HardWear that’s being hawked by Lady Gaga in a commercial airing during the Super Bowl. The 60-second ad, which could cost as much as $10 million (cost for a 30-second spot is over $5 million this year, according to CNBC ) is certainly a play for mass appeal. And maybe, just maybe, Gaga fans. The HardWear jewelry (available for pre-order today) somehow feels Gaga-appropriate. Tiffany HardWear Triple Drop Earrings in 18k gold, $2,500 Tiffany HardWear Link Bracelet in sterling silver, $475 Tiffany HardWear Ball Dangle Ring in 18k gold, $1,775 Tiffany HardWear Wrap Bracelet in sterling silver, $975 Tiffany & Co. is billing the collection as “elegantly subversive,” stating that the unisex-inspired pieces symbolize the “power and edge of the city and the energy of its streets.” The collection is the last from creative director Francesca Amfitheatrof, whose departure was announced last month. That edginess aligns with Gaga — in theory. But the campaign itself, so far consisting of several images and a teaser video (pending that big Super Bowl commercial!), is far more muted, with Gaga lolling around, all chignon’d and black turtleneck’d, in what looks like a penthouse apartment with lots of chic neutral furniture.
