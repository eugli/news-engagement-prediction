The blatant defensive slide forced head coach John Calipari to call a 3-hour practice that consisted of 90 percent defense on Wednesday -- and it appears improvements have been made. \nKentucky held the Crimson Tide to 20 points in the first 20 minutes and limited them to 21.4 percent shooting from the 3-point line. That's .795 points per possession -- a vast improvement from where this team has been recently. \nAfter giving up 35 points over the final 8:27 in a 92-85 win over LSU last week, the Wildcats (20-5, 10-2 SEC) held the Crimson Tide (14-10, 7-5) to 35 over the first 30:36. \nFor the game, Alabama shot 45.1 percent from the floor, UK's best defensive effort since holding South Carolina to 41.4 percent Jan. 21. \nKentucky returns to action Tuesday night, where they'll look to exact revenge against Tennessee. The Volunteers scored an 82-80 win in Knoxville Jan. 24. Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:13:20.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
