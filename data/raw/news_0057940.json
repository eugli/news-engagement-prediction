Jan Oblak \nBut ever since a fax machine blunder on deadline day in 2015, Real have since swapped their focus to Blues stopper, Courtois. \nThe Belgian No1 has already spent time during his career in Madrid, following three massively successful seasons at Atletico. \nAntonio Conte knows Zinedine Zidane is interesting in bringing the giant keeper to the Bernabeu and has already set about finding a replacement, particularly as Courtois and his family enjoyed their time in the Spanish capital. \nSlovenian stopper Oblak appears to be the man for the Stamford Bridge chief, according to Goal, after impressing in La Liga. \nChelsea will hope to keep hold of Courtois – who leads the Big Five leagues in Europe for clean sheets with 13 this season – but are aware Madrid are readying a monster bid. The suggested sum would smash the record for a goalkeeper, currently set by Gianluigi Buffon, who broke all sorts of records when he left Parma for Juventus in 2001 – for a £47.5million fee.
