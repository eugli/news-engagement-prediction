Shift workers had fewer mature eggs than those working normal working hours Credit: PA \nNine in 10 worked normal office hours and 22% said their jobs were moderately to very physically demanding and 40% of women reported lifting or moving heavy objects at work. \nThe authors caution that the study is observational, so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. \nProfessor Adam Balen, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said: \"In this interesting study, an association has been shown between physically demanding jobs and lower potential fertility. \n\"It is difficult to hypothesise a mechanism by which a physically demanding job may have a negative effect on ovarian reserve, as the number of eggs (oocytes) is determined at birth and lost progressively throughout life, with smoking having been shown to be the main toxin that significantly diminishes ovarian reserve. \n\"It is important to note that there was no difference in smoking status between the groups. \n\"I wonder therefore if there may have been maternal influences on the women studied that could have affected their ovarian reserve at birth, for example maternal smoking and nutrition, which might then have some bearing on the future reproductive health of their daughters.\" Last updated Wed 8 Feb 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:17:00.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
