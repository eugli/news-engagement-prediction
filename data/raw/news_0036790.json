It's kept me on top of all sorts of things.\" Photo: Dame Edna features in Meat and Livestock Australia's latest advertisement for the beef industry. (Supplied: Meat and Livestock Australia) Will it work? \nUniversity of Western Australia media and communication lecturer Dr Tauel Harper said the Dame Edna advertisement followed a long line of MLA ads designed to be easily shared. \n\"I think it will be successful, largely because of the kind of market exposure it's going to get,\" he said. \n\"It's got a few viral techniques that make it very shareable on social media. \n\"It's fun, ironic and very shareable.\" \nDr Harper said using a man dressed up as a woman to target women was an interesting choice, but had obvious benefits. \n\"The Dame Edna character can get away with saying things about women and men which others cannot,\" he said. \n\"She's able to make a few cheeky double entendres and jokes, and gets away with it. \n\"Some of this ad is bitching about men, so if you had a woman doing that, there's a chance the male-rights activists will get up in arms and say 'How dare a women say that?' \n\"But because it's Dame Edna, you understand it's all tongue-in-cheek and just in good fun.\" Vegetarian jokes losing their bite \nLike many of MLA's Australia Day lamb ads, the Dame Edna video takes a gentle swipe at vegetarians. \n\"Beef is your best natural source of iron … and it won't give you wind like a spinach smoothie,\" Dame Edna declares. \nDr Harper said vegetarian jokes were a proven formula for MLA, but it was perhaps a technique that was getting \"diminishing returns\". \n\"It works because it's controversial and it's confrontational, but I think people are becoming used to it,\" he said. \n\"I do think the strategy is diminishing a little bit.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:10:11.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
