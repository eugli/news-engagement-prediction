There isn't a lot he hasn't done, but he is also getting on a bit now, as he will be 40-years-old by the start of next season. \nMany expect Brady to stop playing at some point, perhaps even if he wins the Super Bowl this weekend, but not the Patriots, according to reports.

They also believe he can still play at a top level, as they are willing to trade away backup Jimmy Garoppolo. \nHe tweeted: \"In their long-term planning, #Patriots believe QB Tom Brady will play 3-5 more years, sources say. That's why trading Jimmy G is possible.\" Article continues below Marcelo abused for not wishing Cristiano happy birthday - reacts brilliantly \nRapoport also reported that New England will look to give the 39-year-old a contract extension next offseason, which is a good sign that the team wants to continue with him under center for many more seasons to come. \nHe said: \"#Patriots will look to extend QB Tom Brady next offseason, source says. Clear indication they believe his proclamation to play into his 40s.\" \nTo put things into perspective, when Peyton Manning won the Super Bowl in his last game before retirement last season, he was on the verge of turning 40-years-old. The oldest NFL player in history was Hall of Famer George Blanda, who played at quarterback until he was 48 with a total of 26 seasons, the most seasons played by a single player in NFL history. \nBrady would have to play another 10 years at least to beat that record, and in today's game, we'll be lucky to see that. Still, after what we have seen this season, we know he can keep on playing at a high level despite his age and cement his status as the greatest player of all time. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
