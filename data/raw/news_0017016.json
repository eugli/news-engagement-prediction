Both of them are writers - former additional secretary Mahbub Talukder and Professor Tofail Ahmed. \nOne each proposed by the two major parties made it to the EC - Kabita and Mahbub. \nThe two other new election commissioners are former secretary Rafiqul Islam and former brigadier general Shahadat Hossain Chowdhury. \nFormer cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder was the other choice of the search committee for the CEC's post. \nFive years ago, his name had come up as a prospective CEC along with that of Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmad. Majumder, who retired in 2008, has thus been unable to make it to the office for a second time. \nCabinet Secretary Shafiul, however, 'could not remember' which party proposed Nurul Huda and Ali Imam's names for the CEC job. \n\"I can't remember now... but not the two major parties (the Awami League and BNP), some other party,\" he said on being asked. \nA central leader of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JaSoD), led by Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu, has told bdnews24.com that they proposed Huda's name. \nFreedom fighter Huda went to the battlefield during the Liberation War under JaSoD founding president major Abdul Jalil. The new CEC also got involved with the JaSoD later. \nJoining Bangladesh Civil Service in 1973, he had remained an officer on special duty (OSD) for a long time during the BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami government before retiring as a secretary in 2006. \nThe search committee recommendations also included professors Zarina Rahman Khan and Nazmul Ahsan Kalimullah. \nShafiul said the new EC includes names proposed by 'all the major parties'. \nAsked which political parties' recommendations other than those of the BNP and Awami League could make it to the list of 10, he said, \"I'll have to check the record. I canâ€™t recall.\" \nHe thinks even though the names were proposed by the political parties, the persons are 'impartial'.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T10:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:03:41.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
