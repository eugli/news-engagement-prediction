Last Updated: Thursday, February 16, 2017 - 13:23 0 Follow @ZeeNewsSports \nNew Delhi: And finally her words came true. After losing the Super Bowl bet recently, tennis star Eugenie Bouchard had agreed to go on a blind date with one of her fans. \nThe Canadian tennis star, who lost a bet after the New England Patriots fought back against Atlanta Falcons to win Super Bowl 51, showed she was a women of words after she went on the date with John Goehrke – the 20-year-old who proved to be a lucky fan. \nWhile many thought her promise of a 'blind date' to Goehrke might not happen, the fans were up for a surprise when Bouchard posted a photo on social media with the latter on Wednesday. \n\"Just met my 'Super Bowl Twitter Date' John On our way to the @BrooklynNets game!,\" Bouchard tweeted. \nJust met my 'Super Bowl Twitter Date' John On our way to the @BrooklynNets game! @punslayintwoods pic.twitter.com/DHRgY46smd \n— Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 16, 2017 \nThe two went on to see a Brooklyn Nets NBA home game against Milwaukee. \nThe 22-year-old also shared the video of them watching the match: \n\n— Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 16, 2017 \nIt all started after during the much talked about Super Bowl match when the New England Patriots were down 28-3 against Atlanta Falcons. Bouchard tweeted saying she knew the latter would win. \n\n— Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017 \n\nIt was then when Goehrke asked her, “if patriots win we go on a date?” \n\n“Sure,” Bouchard replied. \nMuch to the surprise of all those who were watching the match, as Patriots fought back to win the match, Bouchard asked her fan, “So...where do you live?” \nEarlier this month, quarterback Tom Brady took home his fifth Super Bowl title when the New England Patriots came back from a score of 28-3, to register a fairy tale victory over Atlanta Falcons.
