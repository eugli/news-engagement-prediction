If you want scoop on a specific show, send your questions to . \nThanks for all the Rihanna scoop about Bates Motel . Do you have anything else about the final season? — Gary As I recently mentioned , the new season picks up about 18 months after Norma’s death — though not everyone is aware of her demise. “Dylan still doesn’t know that Norma has died,” EP Kerry Ehrin tells me. Despite his role in her death, Norman is unsurprisingly living in denial and doesn’t recognize that Norma is gone. “For the most part, no. It’s too painful of an admission to look at,” Ehrin says. “Norman is living in multiple realities and functioning — at the moment.” \nAnything fun coming up for Linstead on Chicago P.D. ? — Faima Sorry to break it to you, but there’s trouble brewing for Linstead. “A past ‘undisclosed’ relationship of Halstead’s comes back into the picture, putting his relationship with Lindsay on the rocks,” EP Matt Olmstead teases. \nGot anything on Kai’s return to The Vampire Diaries ? — Jamie Let’s not forget that Damon was the one who killed Kai — so you can imagine there will be some tension there. Wait , just kidding . According to Chris Wood, Kai and Damon will find themselves on the same team . “I don’t think he really thinks too hard about what Damon did to him. That’s because he, in some ways, knows that he deserved it,” Wood says. “And Kai’s sharp enough and witty enough to talk himself out of a corner and, at least for the time being, gain an ally in Damon.” However, the Kai-Damon dynamic is one we’re familiar with — the two of them did share a prison world, after all — so this time around, it sounds like Kai might get to interact with other characters. “There’s some nice little surprise encounters,” Wood teases. Also, did you see this and this ? \nIs there any chance you could get some Blue Bloods scoop? — Helia I can exclusively reveal that Isaiah Washington has just signed on to guest star on Blue Bloods for the upcoming 150th episode, which is slated to air at the end of March. The 100 star will play ESU Deputy Chief Travis Jackson, who, on the eve of his mandatory retirement, goes up against Frank with an age-discrimination suit against the department. \nAre we going to learn more about Maggie outside of her relationship with Alex on Supergirl ? — Jana You’ll get a tidbit about Maggie’s background during the Valentine’s Day episode, but there’s more to come down the line. “There’s a storyline coming up where it’s not really about Alex and Maggie’s relationship, it’s more about Maggie as a cop getting caught up in an art heist,” EP Andrew Kreisberg tells me. \nWhen are Arizona and Eliza just going to go for it on Grey’s Anatomy ? — Katie It sounds like there will be some movement soon, but it’s certainly slow going, especially when Arizona tries to distance herself from Eliza in the wake of Thursday’s episode. “Eliza has a crazy uphill battle at Grey’s ,” Marika Dominczyk says. “What happens this week rattles her and she has to pick herself up back again and decide how she’s going to be moving forward.” \nChicago Fire ? — Mary It sounds like there’s also trouble ahead for Dawson and Casey! Dawson’s dad, last seen drunkenly announcing his divorce, will soon be back. Dawson is going to invite him to live with Casey and her until he gets back on his feet, which will not be good for their young marriage. \nWhere’s that Thea scoop for Arrow that you promised on Superhero Insider ? — Kelsey Thea may have been MIA for quite a while, but Arrow will shine a light on her in a big way in the back half of the season. “She’s headed in a direction that’s very similar to where her mother was before she was killed in season 2,” EP Wendy Mericle says. “I’m actually really excited about her storyline, because we’re taking her to a place where she’s been dealing with all of these issues the same way Oliver has, with her bloodlust and with other elements of her past, and this season’s going to find her in a similar place, but for very different reasons. There’s gonna be a great scene coming up between Oliver and Thea that’s one of my favorites on the show.” \nJust tell me: Is Rufus okay after getting shot in Chicago on Timeless ?! — Patricia If you mean still alive , then yes, don’t worry! If you mean perfectly healthy , well…“Listen, he’s one of our main characters and he’s incredibly popular,” EP Shawn Ryan says. “I don’t think we’re trying to seriously convince the audience that we’re about to kill him. Really what we’re trying to do is show the obstacles that he faces and that the team faces. We’ll address pretty quickly what his fate is.” Feel better now? \nWill we ever find out Sandstorm’s real name on Blindspot ? — Caroline That’s a negative, Caroline. “We’re a little nervous that they’re just so many names to keep straight already — you’ve got the FBI, Zero division, Sandstorm, Jane Doe and now Alice Kruger,” EP Martin Gero says. “We felt like adding another name on top of Sandstorm was gilding the lily. You’re going to find out what they stand for and what they believe in, but I don’t know that they have a name for themselves.” \nThis week in TV: Dear Martin Gero, please make a Rich Dotcom spinoff. Thanks, Nat. \nThat’s a wrap on this week’s Spoiler Room. Be sure to email your questions to or tweet them to @NatalieAbrams . \nAdditional reporting by Samantha Highfill and Shirley Li.
