Repeat this is not a drill,” the National Weather Service said Sunday, urging people living below Oroville Dam to evacuate. The evacuation was ordered because of a “hazardous situation” involving the Northern California dam's emergency spillway. The National Weather Service said the auxiliary spillway is expected to fail and could send an “uncontrolled release of flood waters from Lake Oroville.” Feb. 12, 2017, 7:56 p.m. How the Oroville Dam situation became a crisis Shelby Grad \nHere's some key facts about Oroville Dam crisis: \n--The mass evacuations underway below the Oroville Dam capped a week of frantic efforts to prevent flooding as America’s tallest dam reached capacity and its main spillway was severely damaged. \n--On Saturday, water levels reached so high that an emergency spillway was used for the first time. At first, oOfficials initially believed the measure worked. But on Sunday afternoon, as more water for from record storms flowed into Lake Oroville, officials detected a hole in the emergency spillway. That prompted the evacuation order. \n--Officials are trying to reduce water levels at the dam and repair the emergency spillway. \n--Officials worry that a failure of the emergency spillway could cause huge amounts of water to flow into the Feather River, which runs through downtown Oroville, and other waterways. The result could be flooding and levee failures for miles south of the dam, depending on how much water is released. \n--Officials have said they don’t know how much water would run into the Feather River. But a huge release could flood many communities. Right now, river levels currently are still below flood stage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:05:07.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
