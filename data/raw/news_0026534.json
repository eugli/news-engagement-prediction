He was charged with fourth-degree assault, disorderly conduct, terroristic threatening and trespassing.

And not because he was interested in what was going on outside his team huddle. \n\"There was a little bit of a commotion in our huddle,\" Larranaga said, via the Louisville Courier-Journal . \"I glanced up, and there was someone there in our huddle, I believe in red. We don't normally wear red.\" \nAuthorities got to him pretty quickly, so it's highly unlikely he was able to get whatever information he was apparently so desperately seeking from Miami. He'll be pleased to know his team won, 71-66. But he might have to learn that delightful bit of news from a jail cell because of this stunt.
