The conflict between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian separatists erupted after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in March 2014. \nUkrainians in Kiev have put the most recent killings down to infighting among rebels. Military commentator and MP Dmytro Tymchuk suggested that Givi had begun ignoring orders, particularly during the escalation of fighting at Avdiivka last week, just outside Donetsk. Media caption \"There is an ugly persistence to Europe's forgotten war\" - Tom Burridge reports \nGivi led the so-called Somali battalion during the rebels' successful campaign to seize control of Donetsk airport. \nHe was one of the best-known faces among the separatists, along with Arseny Pavlov, widely known as Motorola, who was blown up in a lift at a block of flats in Donetsk last October. \nPavlov, a Russian military veteran, was high on Kiev's wanted list, having told reporters that he had killed 15 Ukrainian prisoners. Mysterious deaths \nEver since the conflict in the east began, there have been numerous incidents involving separatist leaders and rarely have the attackers been caught. \nJanuary 2015: Oleksandr Bednov, head of Luhansk rapid reaction force, shot dead with bodyguards \nMay 2015: Oleksiy Mozhovyy, killed with entourage in ambush \nAugust 2016: Ihor Plotnitskiy, head of the self-styled Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), survives an attack on his car; both his parents died in Russia the following month, reportedly of mushroom poisoning \nSeptember 2016: Ex-Plotnitskiy adviser hangs himself while in detention for allegedly plotting a coup \nJanuary 2017: Ex-LPR leader Valeriy Bolotov dies suddenly in Moscow, weeks after accusing Plotnitskiy of illegally seizing power.
