Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports An exciting young heavyweight is facing a suspension. Justin Ledet was flagged by USADA for a potential anti-doping violation, the UFC announced Wednesday. The Texas native likely failed a drug test, stemming from a Jan. 12 sample collection. The name of the banned substance was not listed, as is the policy of USADA and the UFC unless the athlete names it. The name of the substance will be released following the USADA adjudication process. Ledet (7-0) recently withdrew from a fight with Dmitry Sosnovskiy at UFC Fight Night 104 due to injury. The 6-foot-4 heavyweight is 2-0 in the UFC, including a first-round submission of Mark Godbeer back in November. Ledet, 28, is considered a solid prospect in a division in need of new blood.
