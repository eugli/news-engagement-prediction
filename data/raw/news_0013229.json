Photo: Ben Rushton \nMr Macdonald is charged with two counts of misconduct in public office for inviting private company Doyles Creek Mining to apply for, and later granting it, a lucrative coal exploration licence without a competitive tender. \nDoyles Creek Mining was chaired by Mr Maitland, a former national secretary of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. He is facing two counts of being an accessory before the fact. \nBoth men have pleaded not guilty to the charges. \nCrown prosecutor Michael McHugh, SC, alleged in his opening address to the jury that Mr Macdonald \"misused his power\" by placing the interests of a company chaired by his \"mate\" Mr Maitland above the interests of the state. Advertisement \nThe licence was worth tens of millions of dollars and was granted in December 2008 without a competitive tender at a time when NSW was facing \"budget constraints\", he said. \nMr McHugh told the jury a BHP subsidiary paid $91 million in 2006 to explore for coal at Caroona in NSW while China Shenhua Energy Limited paid $276 million in 2008 for its Watermark licence. \nThe court heard Doyles Creek Mining did not make such a payment. \nMr McHugh alleged Mr Macdonald was motivated to favour the company to cultivate the \"friendship and loyalty\" of Mr Maitland, who might be useful when Mr Macdonald's political career came to an end. \nMr McHugh said a strategy was devised for the proposed Doyles Creek Mine to be pitched as a \"training\" facility. \nMr Maitland \"stood to gain a personal benefit\" and later sold some of his shares in a company which acquired Doyles Creek Mining for more than $6 million, he said. \nThe court heard Mr Maitland supported Mr Macdonald's bid for preselection for a seat in the NSW upper house in 2007 at a time when others, including the now NSW Opposition Leader Luke Foley, were not supportive. \nAmong the witnesses expected to be called during the trial, estimated to run for up to eight weeks, are Mr Foley, federal Labor MP Anthony Albanese and former premiers Morris Iemma and Nathan Rees. \nThe trial continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:26:11.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
