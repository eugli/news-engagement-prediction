But rejecting the challenge, Lord Justice Burnett said there was no duty in UK law upon the government to refrain from recognising Northern Cyprus.\nThe United Nations itself works with Northern Cyprus law enforcement agencies and facilitates co-operation between the two parts of the island.\n\"In the circumstances of this case, the public interest in cooperation is clear,\" said the judge, who considered the case with Mrs Justice Thirlwall.\n\"The claimant is suspected of being part of a significant drug conspiracy. Had he remained in England, he would have been prosecuted.\n\"He has put himself beyond the reach of the criminal justice system if England and Wales.\n\"There is a clear public interest in him being prosecuted elsewhere if that is possible. It is possible in Northern Cyprus.\"\nHe accepted that there was evidence of concerns in relation to conditions in the male prison in Northern Cyprus.\nHowever, that did not mean that the conditions were not up to the standard required by the European Human Rights Convention.\nThe judges dismissed Mr Akarcay's challenge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:03:04.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
