RCMP \n“Our specialists have transformed pure fentanyl into a diluted liquid form, enabling our dogs to train with the real smell of fentanyl with no risk of inhaling it. \nIt is particularly efficient, making the dogs in the field extremely productive,” said Staff Sgt. Eric Stebenne, senior trainer at the RCMP Police Dog Service Training Centre (PDSTC) in Innisfail, Alta, where the training is taking place. \nRCMP dog handler with fentanyl sniffing dog at scent wall.

One of the dogs recently helped intercept 12,000 fentanyl tablets in British Columbia. \nEventually all 139 RCMP narcotics profile dog teams from across the country will receive the training, expected to be completed by mid-July 2017. \nFentanyl sniffing dog sits in front of RCMP dog handlers RCMP \nFentanyl is an opioid about 100 times more toxic than morphine which can cause serious harm, including death.
