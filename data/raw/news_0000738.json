MONDAY NIGHT RAW AMBUSH \nWhile it clearly wasn’t intentional, the attack resulted in Rollins suffering a legitimate injury, on the same knee that saw him miss WrestleMania 32 completely and he’s in danger of missing the event in Orlando too.

KNEE INJURY \nFocus on Rollins’ right leg, you’ll be able to see that when Samoa Joe locks in his Coquina Clutch towards the end of the clip, Rollins’ leg gets trapped in an awkward position as he lands on the canvas. \nIt’s also slightly noticeable in the video WWE uploaded on their YouTube channel. \nIf you skip to the 3:20 mark, you’ll be able to hear Rollins let out a noise at the exact moment is right leg was trapped and he was brought down, signalling he was in pain but you'd be forgiven for assuming he was selling the ambush. \nWhile it’s an upsetting time for Rollins and his fans, let’s hope he’s able to recover in time and avoid missing out on a second successive WrestleMania. \nWhat do you make of Seth Rollins suffering another knee injury?
