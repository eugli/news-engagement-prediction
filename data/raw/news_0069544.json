Replays showed heavy contact on Aguero and referee Lahoz immediately blew whistle.\nWhat followed left almost all at the Etihad stunned as the official signalled for a Monaco free-kick and produced a yellow card for a incredulous Aguero. On the touchline Guardiola was raging at anyone within earshot.\nPep Guardiola was left raging when Sergio Aguero was denied a penalty and booked for diving\nBefore the second half drama of Manchester City's 5-3 win the Aguero decision looked key\nDanijel Subasic felled the striker but it was the Argentine who was penalised and booked\nIn the BT Sport studio all three pundits disagreed to varying degrees with Luhoz's decision.\n'It's a blatant penalty,' said Steven Gerrard. 'Yeah, the keeper gets a fraction of a touch, but still - it's a clear foul. He wipes him out and City are very unlucky not to get a penalty.'\nRio Ferdinand concurred, saying the City boss was well within his rights to react the way he did. He said: 'Pep is rightly going bananas, because for me that's a definite penalty.'\nRichard Dunne was non-committal on if the penalty call was correct but questioned Luhoz's decision to book Aguero.\nMateu Lahoz was perhaps the only man at the Etihad who thought Aguero dived\n'Whether it's a penalty or not, it's certainly not a dive and that's what the referee has interpreted it as,' added the former City man.\n'No wonder the fans and the manager are going crazy about it.'\nLuhoz's standing amongst City fans, players and staff would fall further when he awarded a soft second half penalty, seemingly on the advice of the official behind the goal.\nPundit Steven Gerrard said the referee had denied Guardiola's side a 'blatant penalty'\nFortunately for the home side Radamel Falcao saw his spot kick saved by Will Caballero. Post-match the pundits were in agreement that this time Luhoz got the second penalty shout correct.\n'It was definitely a penalty, he doesn't even know that Falcao is there,' said Ferdinand.\n'He's thinks he is tackling fresh air. It's a great run, it's a bad penalty [to give away], his body positioning is all wrong.'\nGerrard added: 'The fifth official has helped him out with the decision, but it was definitely a penalty for me.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:12:43.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
