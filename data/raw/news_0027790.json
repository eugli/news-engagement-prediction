The couple finally moved into it in 1988. \n\n3) But for brief periods in 1996 and 2012, when Jayalalithaa sent her out of No 81, Veda Nilayam, for anti-party activities, Sasikala had been staying with her. \n\n4) Even when her husband was thrown out of the house in 1990, she did not leave. The relationship with Natarajan continues to be strained even today. \n\n5) Only after 2012 did Jayalalithaa keep her out of administrative matters as a fallout of the proximity some officials gained to the CM. \n\n6) After Jaya's death, Sasikala returned to Poes Garden and, as Jaya has not left any will behind, she continued to occupy the house that does not belong to her even today. And it is this house that she draws all her powers from and it is under the tutelage of Jayalalithaa that she learnt all the political manoeuvring that is now on display in Tamil Nadu. \n\n7) O Panneerselvam himself was promoted by none other than Sasikala and her nephew T T V Dinakaran. \n\n8) Sasikala's public image has always been of an outsider trying to usurp power through the back door.
