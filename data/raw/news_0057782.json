Near the commercial’s end, he says, “A young boy from Harlem, I couldn’t even be a waiter. They didn’t want me to be a waiter, so you know what I did? I became a billionaire.” \nThe internet took that as a huge win for Hip Hop as Diddy received a much praise and news coverage. According to a post from his Instagram account, he simply misspoke and isn’t a billionaire yet. \n“A lot of blogs took that as I had become Hip Hop’s first billionaire,” said Diddy. “That is not the case.
