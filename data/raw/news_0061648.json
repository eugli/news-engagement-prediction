In a game-of-the-week candidate, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov tapped into the game's chaos more efficiently than Wesley So, finally overmatching So's queen with a rook and minor pieces in the endgame. \nSo's classical streak remains unbroken at 56 games without defeat, and it is perhaps even more impressive that he managed to get through almost the entirety of his regular season in a rapid tournament without defeat, succumbing only in his final game. \nSo's defeat had little impact on the match as both the involved teams, the St Louis Arch Bishops and the San Jose Hackers, had secured entry into the playoffs, but for many teams, success yesterday was essential.

Download PGN Eastern Division Qualifiers \nEntering the day, the Delhi Dynamite, Budapest Gambit, and Gorky Stormbringers had all earned spots in the playoffs. Wednesday night done right with @PROChessLeague ðŸ‘Š Wrapped up the qualifier as division leaders ðŸ’ªðŸ¤— pic.twitter.com/4B3iGuVwLd â€” Tania Sachdev ( @TaniaSachdev ) February 23, 2017 \nCampaigning for entry were these teams: the Norway Gnomes vs the Ljubljana Direwolves, the Mumbai Movers vs the Gorky Stormbringers (already qualified), and the Belgrade Sparrows vs the Riga Magicians. \nThe Norway Gnomes and the Ljubljana Direwolves naturally drew much attention as the world champion struggled to assist his team. The Gnomes have not been the powerhouse that many thought they would be, but they are undoubtedly stronger with Carlsen in the lineup. Last week, they defeated the division-leading Delhi Dynamite, and their tiebreaks were the best in their division. Still their frustrations had induced stoicism in their team manager, GM Jon Ludwig Hammer . \nAlso, he lost a tough game to Adams in the Sharjah Grand Prix Hopefully this cheers him up The decisive @NorwayGnomes -match just started at @chesscom for those interested. Personally I'm busy comfort eating at the dessert buffet. â€” Jon Ludvig Hammer ( @gmjlh ) February 22, 2017 \nCarlsen was in peak form in the first three games. All three of his initial wins were well worth study. Here is the second. \nWhen Carlsen is in the lineup, the rest of the team must sport a lower rating to stay under the cap. Boards three and four, Sebastian Mihajlov and Bertil Svendsen were excellent, scoring 2/4 each, but board two, IM Johan Salomon only scored 0.5/4. In the final game, Carlsen got into into trouble against GM Luka Lenic , and the Gnomes were on the brink of defeat. \nStout resistance saved the game and drew the match, enough to qualify the tiebreak-rich Gnomes for the playoffs. \nFor the Ljubljana Direwolves, the result was disheartening. They miss out on the playoffs by one point on tiebreaks. They were one of the most fun teams in the league, sporting Ninja Turtles handles and making regular videos. \nThe other qualifiers were the Mumbai Movers who drew their match against the Gorky Stormbringers, and the Riga Magicians who were awarded match victory against the Belgrade Sparrows in light of a fair-play violation. Central Division Qualifiers \nThe straits were narrower in the Central Division as four teams had secured playoff spots: the Marseille Migraines, Stockholm Snowballs, Amsterdam Mosquitoes, and Cannes Blockbusters. Two matches were capable of elevating all four of the participating teams into the playoffs. The Hamburg Swashbucklers played the London Lions while the London Towers played Apeldoorn Apes. \nIn the end, both London teams snagged slots though there were turbulent moments. \nFor example, it wasn't enough for his team, but GM \"Roely\" Pruissjers played a beautiful finish against the London Towers' GM Keith Arkell .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T09:12:31.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
