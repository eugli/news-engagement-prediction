Dictionaries, Atheists, Freethinkers, and Others on Defining Atheism Agnosticism & Atheism Expert By Austin Cline \nThere is, unfortunately, some disagreement about the definition of atheism . It is interesting to note that most of that disagreement comes from theists - atheists themselves tend to agree on what atheism means. Christians in particular dispute the definition used by atheists and insist that atheism means something very different. \nThe broader, and more common, understanding of atheism among atheists is quite simply \"not believing in any gods.\" No claims or denials are made - an atheist is just a person who does not happen to be a theist. Sometimes this broader understanding is called \"weak\" or \"implicit\" atheism. Most good, complete dictionaries readily support this. \nThere also exists a narrower sort of atheism, sometimes called \"strong\" or \"explicit\" atheism. With this type, the atheist explicitly denies the existence of any gods Â— making a strong claim which will deserve support at some point. Some atheists do this and others may do this with regards to certain specific gods but not with others. Thus, a person may lack belief in one god, but deny the existence of another god. \nBelow are links to a variety of references pages to help understand how atheism is defined and why atheists define it the way they do. \n\nWhat is Atheism? Explanation of the \"strong\" and \"weak\" senses of atheism and why the latter, weak atheism , is both broad in what it means and common in how it is applied. Most atheists you meet will probably be weak atheists , not strong atheists .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:46:06.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
