The first phase will see 16 groups of three teams, with the top two advancing to a 32-team knockout phase under plans approved by Fifa last month. \nAsia are expected to get eight to nine places, compared to 4.5 now, and South America, which has 10 member countries, a total of six, also up from 4.5. \nThe Concacaf region, made up of the Caribbean, Central and North American countries, would get 6.5 places, compared to 3.5, with Oceania, the small Pacific Islands confederation, having one automatic place at the finals instead of 0.5. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:42:50.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
