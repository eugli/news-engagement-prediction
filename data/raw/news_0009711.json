A bacon cheeseburger. A triple espresso. For many people, these are favorite foods and drinks. But if you get migraines, they can also trigger a throbbing headache. Learn how to identify and manage food triggers so you enjoy more pain-free days. If you suffer from migraines, you know how debilitating they can be. Unlike other kinds of headaches, the throbbing pain of a migraine is often accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light or sound. Sometime they can sideline you for up to a week. So you’re willing to do almost anything to avoid them. That’s why it’s important to pay attention to what might set them off. Migraine headaches can be triggered by a variety of items, foods and events. At times, a combination of factors bring on a migraine. A glass of full-bodied merlot. A bacon cheeseburger. A triple espresso. For many people, these are favorite foods and drinks. But if you get migraines, they can also trigger a throbbing headache. Learn how to identify and manage food triggers so you enjoy more pain-free days. For example, many women have migraines around the time of their periods or find they’re more severe then. Other triggers include too much stress and not getting enough sleep. Even bright sunlight, or strong odors such as perfume, can set off an attack. Plus, there are foods and drinks. “The list of possible dietary triggers is extensive,” says migraine researcher Ana Recober, MD, neurologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and assistant professor of neurology at Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. So how can you control them? Here are eight facts you need to know about migraine triggers... A glass of full-bodied merlot. A bacon cheeseburger. A triple espresso. For many people, these are favorite foods and drinks. But if you get migraines, they can also trigger a throbbing headache. Learn how to identify and manage food triggers so you enjoy more pain-free days. 1. Migraine triggers are different for everyone. Not every food will be a trigger for you, says Kathleen Mullin, MD, a neurologist at the Headache Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. “If you avoid every food that ever triggered a migraine in someone else, you'd never eat again,” she says. What’s more: The same food may not consistently trigger a migraine attack every time in the same patient, Dr. Recober says. That’s why you must pay attention to your own experiences. “If you had Chinese food last month and got a headache the next day, and it happened again this month, then you've discovered a trigger for you,” Dr. Mullin says.

The first step in identifying your food triggers is to keep a detailed headache diary. Note the days and times you experience migraine pain, how long the headache lasts, and what you ate or drank before getting the migraine, advises Frederick G. Freitag, DO, medical director of the Comprehensive Headache Center at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. Apps, such as Curelater, can help you keep track of possible triggers. “People who use apps are often surprised to learn that something they thought was a trigger actually wasn’t,” Dr. Freitag says.

Caffeine is a common trigger. “Caffeine heads the list of migraine triggers, especially when it’s more than about 300 mg per day,” Dr. Freitag says. That’s roughly the amount of caffeine in about three cups of coffee. To test whether caffeine triggers a migraine for you, skip all caffeine for two full days, Dr. Freitag advises. “If you don’t get a rip-roaring headache, then you’re probably safe,” he says.

Luncheon meats, such as bologna and salami, are common migraine triggers because they contain two substances that affect blood vessels in the brain. 1. Tyramine is an amino acid that can cause blood vessels to constrict and then expand. 2. Nitrates are preservatives that increase blood flow to the brain. Foods that contain food dyes, MSG (monosodium glutamate), aspartame and soy-based products also can be problematic, he says. On the other hand, “chocolate gets a bad rap that it does not deserve, as do most cheeses,” Dr. Freitag says. A glass of full-bodied merlot. A bacon cheeseburger. A triple espresso.

You don’t have to give it up. “With alcohol, clear liquor is often better than dark, so choose white wine over red,” Dr. Freitag says. But certain white wines are less troublesome than others, he adds. “Drinking a fruity chardonnay is better than a buttery chardonnay, because buttery chardonnays are aged in oak, and the chemicals from the oak that spill into the wine and give it that buttery taste can also trigger a migraine,” he explains. You can even have red wine – as long as you take precautions. Dr. Freitag has a prevention strategy: “Take about 800 milligrams of ibuprofen – not aspirin or acetaminophen – about an hour before drinking red wine,” he advises. “It is quite effective at suppressing the tendency for headache.” The medicine’s anti-inflammatory properties help ward off migraines, Dr. Freitag says.

A healthy lifestyle can reduce the frequency of attacks. “Trigger factors may work in a cumulative manner to give rise to a migraine,” Dr. Freitag says. That means certain foods may trigger a migraine only if you eat them when you’re sleep-deprived or under a lot of stress. So lifestyle modifications – such as getting adequate sleep, eating a healthy diet, avoiding obesity and staying well hydrated – can influence how often you get migraines. “Migraine brains like predictability,” Dr. Mullin explains. “So, going to bed and awakening at the same time each day, eating at least three meals at the same time each day — these things help fortify against the potential for migraine.” Getting regular exercise is another great strategy to help decrease your susceptibility to other migraine triggers, Dr. Recober says.

The vitamins may shield you from other migraine triggers. “With vitamin D, there’s evidence that even if you’re not deficient in this vitamin, you can have a lot of subtle neurological effects,” Dr. Freitag says. The B vitamins are “intimately involved in the brain’s energy production systems,” Dr. Freitag says. “A lot of neurological disorders are related to B vitamin deficiencies.” But don’t take large doses of either vitamin. A multivitamin supplement every day can keep your neurological system working optimally, he says. A glass of full-bodied merlot. A bacon cheeseburger. A triple espresso.

Some experts believe avoiding triggers completely may backfire and make you more susceptible to them, Dr. Recober says. So, if there’s a food that you particularly love and it sometimes gives you a migraine, it may be better to find ways to include it in your diet without it triggering a migraine, rather than give it up altogether. “Strict avoidance may further sensitize people to those headache-precipitating factors,” she says.
