Congress president Sonia Gandhi ’s son-in-law Robert Vadra today hailed Gurmehar Kaur ‘for taking on fascists bravely’ even as he tore into those who had trolled her for putting up a social media post. “My message to Gurmehar: “I am with you and all those people who stand for their rights & freedom of speech. The nation is proud of you for standing your ground & fighting fascist forces,” Vadra said in a facebook post. Terming the trolling as ‘disgusting and shameful’, Vadra said, “Gurmehar has stood her ground and has made the entire nation & women fraternity proud.” He also said, “A daughter of a martyred army man, Gurmehar has been trolled on social media with rape threats. In an interview, she said, “I have been getting a lot of threats on social media. I think it is very scary when people threaten you with violence or with rape.” Gurmehar has stood her ground and has made the entire nation & women fraternity proud.”\nThe political slugfest over Ramjas college row, is set to escalate with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal meeting Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal this afternoon. CM Kejriwal will meet the L-G to demand action against ABVP after Gurmehar Kaur had complained of receiving “rape threats” allegedly from the right-wing students’ organization members. Notably, Kargil martyr’s daughter Gurmehar Kaur, who came under harsh criticism from BJP members and certain sections of the society for her campaign against violence in the name of nationalism, today announced that she is ‘withdrawing from the campaign’. “I’m withdrawing from the campaign. Congratulations everyone. I request to be left alone. I said what I had to say,” Kaur tweeted this morning. She also vented her frustration, saying, “I have been through a lot and this is all my 20 year self could take.” Underlining that the ‘campaign is about students and not about’ her, she asked protesters to join a march, which will be taking place later today. “Please go to the March in huge numbers. Best of luck,” she said. “One thing is for sure, next time we will think twice before resorting to violence or threats and that’s all this was about,” she said.\nCheck out Robert Vadra’s Facebook post\nHitting out at those who had trolled her, she said, “To anyone questioning my courage and bravery.. I’ve shown more than enough.” It has been learned that students and teachers from Delhi University and JNU will hold a march from Khalsa College to Arts Faculty. According to reports, left-wing student organization AISA will carry out march even as NSUI is planning to sit on hunger strike.\nYou may also like to watch\nPolice had said they were examining the letter received by the Delhi Commission for Women demanding security for a Kargil martyr’s daughter, who complained of receiving “rape threats” allegedly from ABVP members.
