While she belongs to Khurai, Thoubal is the Assembly constituency of the Chief Minister. \n\nLeichonbam said the party has already started campaigning in Thoubal for Sharmila. \n\nHowever, there is no word yet about her contesting Khurai seat. \n\nLeichonbam said PRJA, which recently was alloted 'whistle' as the party's symbol, is likely to field altogether 10 candidates for the Assembly elections to be held on March 4 and 8. \n\nMeanwhile, the Naga People's Front (NPF), the ruling party in Nagaland, has announced names of 15 candidates for the Manipur Assembly elections.
