Sarah Meehan Under Armour Inc. products will be available at all 1,200 Kohl's Corp. stores in early March. Kohl's CEO Kevin Mansell made the announcement during the release of the retailer's fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday. Under Armour products will be available in Kohl's in early March. Sarah Meehan Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank announced the partnership with the retailer last July, highlighting that the move would help the sportswear maker attract more female customers. Analysts said they expected the move to also provide a boost to Under Armour's growing footwear business. At Kohl's, Under Armour is expected to sell items like basic tank-tops, leggings and shirts in exclusive colors and materials, according to Citi Research analyst Kate McShane, who spoke with Under Armour (NYSE: UAA) in August. The launch comes as Under Armour tries to recover from a rough fourth quarter. Shares of Under Armour's stock have dropped more than 25 percent since late January when the company reported sales growth of less than 20 percent for the first time in 27 quarters. Under Armour has also been challenged by the North American retail environment, where it still does about 85 percent of its business. Sales at Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) should help make up for the loss of The Sports Authority Inc., which went out of business last year. For their part, Kohl's executives remain overwhelmingly positive about Under Armour and expressed excitement during an earnings call about the impact the launch will have on their business. Sales of active and wellness apparel at Kohl's grew double digits in 2016, with similar growth expected again this year, Kohl's said. Under Armour alone, he added, could increase full-year comparable sales at Kohl's by as much as 1 percent. \"We see a massive opportunity with Under Armour with children, women and footwear,\" Mansell said.
