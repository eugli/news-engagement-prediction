The solution would be to become a sort of cyborg. “Some high bandwidth interface to the brain will be something that helps achieve a symbiosis between human and machine intelligence and maybe solves the control problem and the usefulness problem,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:37:06.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
