A large majority of these children did not answer when asked who had abused them. A few children said they had been abused by people who appeared to be in uniform or associated with military and other armed forces, and several others said that strangers had victimised them.\nAlso, nearly half of the 122 women and children interviewed reported sexual abuse during migration - often multiple times and in multiple locations.\nREAD MORE: The cemetery of unknown refugees from the Mediterranean \nWomen and children were often arrested at the Libyan border where they experienced abuse, extortion and gender-based violence. Sexual violence was widespread and systemic at crossings and checkpoints.\nMen were often threatened or killed if they intervened to prevent sexual violence, and women were often expected to provide sexual services or cash in exchange for crossing the Libyan border.\nIn Captivity UNICEF also identified an estimated 34 migrant detention centres in Libya during their research.\nThe Libyan Government Department for Combating Illegal Migration runs 24 detention centres which currently hold between 4,000 and 7,000 detainees. Armed groups also hold migrants in an unknown number of unofficial detention centres.\n\"The route is mostly controlled by smugglers, traffickers and other people seeking to prey upon desperate children and women who are simply seeking refuge or a better life.\"\nAfshan Khan, UNICEF\nChildren did not receive any preferential treatment and were often placed in cells together with adult detainees, which increased the risk of abuse, according to the UNICEF report. Some observers have also reported abandoned refugee children in detention centres and hospitals.\n\"The Central Mediterranean from North Africa to Europe is among the world's deadliest and most dangerous migrant routes for children and women,\" said Afshan Khan, UNICEF Regional Director and Special Coordinator for the Refugee and Response Crises in Europe. \n\"The route is mostly controlled by smugglers, traffickers and other people seeking to prey upon desperate children and women who are simply seeking refuge or a better life. We need safe and legal pathways and safeguards to protect migrating children that keep them safe and keep predators at bay.\" \nRecent data in a survey of women and child refugees in Libya during late 2016 reveal the appalling level of abuse along the migration route. \nAt the time of the survey, 256,000 migrants were recorded in Libya, including 30,803 women and 23,102 children - a third of whom were unaccompanied. The real figures, however, are believed to be at least three times higher. \nMost children and women indicated that they had paid smugglers at the beginning of their journey, leaving many in debt under \"pay as you go\" arrangements and vulnerable to abuse, abduction and trafficking. \nOPINION: EU should invest in development, not security in Africa \nWomen and children also reported harsh and overcrowded conditions, including lack of nutritious food and adequate shelter, in Libyan detention centres run by both the government and armed militias.\n\"Children should not be forced to put their lives in the hands of smugglers because there are simply no alternatives,‚Äù said Khan. \n\"We need to address globally the drivers of migration and work together toward a robust system of safe and legal passage for children on the move, whether refugees or migrants.\" \nSource: Al Jazeera News \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T12:20:27.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
