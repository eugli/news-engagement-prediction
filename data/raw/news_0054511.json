Find out right here what she demands. By DNA | Published: February 22, 2017 9:15 am Kareena Kapoor Khan and BFF Amrita Arora spotted visiting a salon before Randhir Kapoor's birthday bash - see pics \nMove over boys of the industry, the divas are taking over! After delivering some strong female centric films last year, this year, we’ll probably get to see more women dominate the box office. One such woman to have done the deed is none other than Anushka Sharma. She has broken many rules. Stood her own in films with the Khan trio, worked in two-heroines project, and acted in and produced an action film. But she’s never been part of a chick flick. \nNot offered Veere But she is game for any genre. She says, “I would love to do a chick flick. I love exploring new things and genres so I am looking forward to doing one.” There was buzz about her being offered a role in Rhea Kapoor’s Veere Di Wedding. She was reportedly approached for the role offered to Kareena Kapoor Khan , but Anushka has denied this. She may or may not have been offered the role, but she isn’t opposed to the genre. \nALSO READ – Leaked pic! Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli go on a secret lunch date \nGetting the right writers The actress reveals what has kept her away from the genre so far, “I have been wanting to do a chick flick but you have to find the correct writers for it. It cannot be the same old stereotypical story. It needs to have a new language or a new idea to tackle. There needs to be something relevant and interesting. The minute I find a good writer, I am totally on!” \nPulling in the masses Anushka doesn’t subscribe to the theory that heroine-oriented films don’t perform well at the box-office. “Women are suc complicated, complex characters — not in a negative way — but there is much depth and layers to them. It will be interesting to show the interpersonal relationship between women without the presence of a man. It can make for amazing stories. Look at the films being made in the West. We have seen so many stories exploring women and their relationships with each other.” \nShe loves one chick flick, in particular. She says, “Bridesmaids is my favourite. It’s out-and-out funny, hilarious and unapolegetically entertaining.” \nWe’ll see her next in Phillauri. Stay tuned to this space for hot scoop and latest updates.
