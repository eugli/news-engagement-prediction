Thousands of people caught drink-driving twice in five years \nThere are also drivers who have racked up 51, 42 and 39 points. \nDavid Nichols, of road safety charity Brake, said: “The penalty points system is supposed to be in place to protect the public from dangerous repeat offenders and it's appalling that these risky repeat offenders are allowed to keep driving.” \nThe Freedom of Information Requests, sent out by the BBC , found 203 people were still driving despite accumulating more than 18 points. \n\nGreater London was the worst-offending county, with 1,385 people still on the roads despite surpassing the limit. \nDrivers typically hitting the 12-point mark must attend court to face at least a six-month ban, but magistrates can choose otherwise if the offender shows losing their licence will cause “exceptional hardship”.
