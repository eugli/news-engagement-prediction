Image copyright Reuters \nThe expansion reflects the importance of the UK market, which is Amazon's second biggest outside the US, behind Germany. \nServices which are developed in the US are usually launched in the UK first, such as Amazon Fresh, the grocery service which was launched in parts of the UK last summer. 'Illegal hours' \nAs well as expanding in groceries, Amazon is also pushing into fashion, says Natalie Berg, retail analyst at Planet Retail. \nClothes sales are already one of its fastest growing areas and it has been reported that Amazon is close to launching its own-brand fashion label. \nThat rumour has been fuelled by Amazon's creation of a fashion photography studio in London's Shoreditch. \n\"If you are a grocer or fashion retailer, Amazon is keeping you up at night,\" said Ms Berg. \nLast year Amazon had to defend its employment practices after a BBC reporter, working undercover at an agency which was contracted by Amazon to deliver parcels, spoke to drivers who claimed they worked illegally long hours and were expected to deliver up to 200 parcels a day. \nAmazon said it was committed to ensuring drivers drive safely and legally, and are \"fairly compensated\".
