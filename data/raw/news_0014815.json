To celebrate the launch of its new men’s line, He’s a 10, and apparently to troll our president, the haircare company released what I’m nominating as the best commercial of Super Bowl LI . The commercial starts off with a narrator saying, “America, we’re in for at least four years of awful hair” — and it just gets better from there. It even includes last year’s most delightful meme, that newborn baby with a full head of hair . Please watch: “Now is the time for us to come together. This ad captures the true diversity within American culture – we are all perfectly imperfect in our own way,” Carolyn Aronson, a hairstylist and the founder of It’s a 10, said in a release. The commercial is already attracting a lot of partisan YouTube commenters. Some are in support of the commercial: “Love your products and I loved this ad. Bravo!﻿“ Some aren’t: “Another garbage commercial going political Just added another crap product to my list of ‘never buy’ items.” Regardless, it’s one of the few beauty brands out there that’s made any sort of political statement at all. If you’d like to support this company, its most famous product is a leave-in conditioner, which you can get at Ulta for $18. It purports to do, yes, ten different things for your hair, is good for all hair types, and can be used wet or dry. Based on all the online chatter, this commercial scores a ten. (Sorry.)
