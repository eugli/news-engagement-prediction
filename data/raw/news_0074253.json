On senior day, Tom Izzo inserted injured guard Eron Harris into the game in the final seconds so he could get one last ovation from the home crowd. Harris , in full uniform with a brace on his knee, kissed the logo at center court as the clock expired. Harris’ college career ended earlier this month after needing surgery to repair a knee injury . He was Michigan State’s third leading scorer this year and the team’s best three-point shooter. Awesome to see Michigan State's Eron Harris in uniform and on the floor at the end of the win over Wisconsin.

Meanwhile, the Badgers are struggling. This was Wisconsin’s fourth loss in its last five games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:51:14.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
