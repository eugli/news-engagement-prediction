It’s her second surprise reveal, having managed a similarly unexpected one at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards when she was pregnant with daughter Blue Ivy Carter , who is now five. This time, the announcement was delivered through a high-concept photo. The singer revealed in a carefully worded caption that she’s having twins, but the image is the important part. Between the veil, her body’s position, the floral wreath, and the saturated colors she chose, the picture looks very familiar. Let’s take a brief walk through art history—including Beyoncé’s own visual oeuvre and trace the steps back to this glorious day. From Heritage Images/Hulton Archive/Getty Images.
