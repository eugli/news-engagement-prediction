Gasser was originally arrested in December on a charge of manslaughter after an alleged traffic dispute with McKnight. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office (Louisiana) said that \" Gasser shot three rounds from a .40-caliber semi-automatic handgun from the driver's seat of his car through the open passenger window\" after the police determined that \" McKnight and Gasser were driving erratically on the Crescent City Connection bridge or before they reached it,\" per Sanchez. A witness said McKnight may have cut off Gasser before Gasser retaliated. Gasser's bond has been set at $750,000, and he could be sentenced to life in jail with hard labor and no parole if found guilty of the second-degree murder charges. McKnight, who was 28 at the time of his death, played for the New York Jets (2010-12) and Kansas City Chiefs (2014) during his NFL career.
