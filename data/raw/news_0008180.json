Maple Grief \nClaim: President Donald Trump criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for excessive Facebook usage. false Example: [ Collected via e-mail, January 2017 ] \nSaw this on FB. I can not find it in Trump's feed or ProPublica's deleted tweet list. \nOrigin: On 28 January 2017, the satirical web site BurrardStreetJournal.com reported that President Donald Trump had scolded Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for using Facebook too frequently: \n“I mean don’t you have a country to run or something?” Trump asked, labelling the Canadian Prime Minister a “social media whore”. \n“He’s constantly online, 24/7. He’s obsessed,” Trump continued, suggesting the PM should seek psychiatric help for his addiction. \nThe 45th American President claims Trudeau’s “embarrassing” attempts to “get likes” is all the more pathetic given he has so few followers compared to Trump: \n“As of 3am last night, Trudeau only had 3,735,257 followers on Facebook compared to my 19,359,401. Sad.” \nUnlike fake news sites that clearly aim to trick social media users into believing outlandish claims, the Burrard Street Journal's \" About \" page explains: \nThe Burrard Street Journal is a sometimes funny Canadian satire, parody and comedy news website based in Vancouver, BC.
