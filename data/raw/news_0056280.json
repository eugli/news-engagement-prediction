I also want to work at a chocolate factory and do swimming in the Olympics,” the letter reads in part. Andy Bridgewater \nWhile Chloe knows she has quite a few years until she can actually apply, Google CEO Sundar Pichai responded to her handwritten note with his own message of encouragement. \n“I’m glad that you like computers and robots, and hope that you will continue to learn about technology,” he wrote. “I look forward to receiving your job application when you’re finished with school! :)” Letter Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote to 7-year-old Chloe Bridgewater. Andy Bridgewater \nAndy, who currently works in sales for a refrigeration-system parts manufacturer, told Business Insider , when his daughter asked him where his ideal place to work would be, he mentioned the technology company. \n“I said, ‘Oh, Google would be a nice place to work,’” he said. \nHe added: “She is now even more eager to do well at school and work for Google. Can’t thank such a busy person enough to take time out to make a little girl’s dream become one step closer, although not sure she’s fully aware that it’ll take more than riding go-karts and sleeping in pods to make it with Google!
