This in NOT A Drill. This in NOT A Drill.\" \nThe California Department of Water Resources said on Twitter said at about 4:30 p.m. PST that the spillway was \"predicted to fail within the next hour.\" \nState authorities and engineers on Thursday began carefully releasing water from the Lake Oroville Dam some 65 miles (105 km) north of Sacramento after noticing that large chunks of concrete were missing from a spillway. \nThe earthfill dam is just upstream and to the east of Oroville, a city of more than 16,260 people. \nAt 770 feet (230 meters) high, the structure, built between 1962 and 1968, is the tallest dam in the United States, besting the famed Hoover Dam by more than 40 feet (12 meters). \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .
