The foundation of what’s made me who I am today.” \nThe 29-year-old singer also reflects on using fan expectations as “fuel,” saying, “I think making this project, I haven’t shied away from expectations. I really tried to use it as fuel, because people have a positive association with what I do and what I make, and they expect something that’s good. So, OK, how do you convert that into a better moment, a better song, a better album, a better presentation?” \nThe source of the original interview footage is still unclear, but it’s a fascinating find nonetheless.
