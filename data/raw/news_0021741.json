Share via Twitter Stuart C. Wilson / Getty Images Prince William has been a public advocate for mental health awareness for years, and he even formed the mental health advocacy charity Heads Together with his wife and brother. Now, he’s making a passionate plea for people to abolish the taboo of grappling with mental health issues. In a speech to the U.K.’s Guild of Health writers, Prince William said that “we all” struggle with mental health issues sometimes. “Mental health was the great taboo. If you were anxious , it’s because you were weak,” he said, according to People . “If you couldn’t cope with whatever life threw at you, it’s because you were failing. Successful, strong people don’t suffer like that, do they? But of course—we all do. It’s just that few of us speak about it.” Prince William says he first became interested in mental health through his work as an air ambulance pilot after witnessing issues others faced. Now, he says, he’s hoping he can help foster an atmosphere where people feel empowered to speak up if they’re struggling with mental health. “On average, it takes a sufferer 10 years to admit to a problem ,” he said. “This means that what often starts as a fairly minor issue becomes something serious and medical as time passes. Silence can kill; but talking can lead to help and support.” Simon Rego, Psy.D., chief psychologist at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, applauds Prince William’s comments. “It furthers the discussion and awareness and can be significant in making a positive impact on [the lives of people] who are suffering from these conditions,” he tells SELF. Prince William addresses the stigma that surrounds seeking help for mental illness, which clinical psychologist John Mayer , Ph.D., tells SELF is important. Viewing mental health struggles as a sign of weakness is “ignorant,” Mayer says, but it has a historical element. Societies around the world used to treat mental illness as a weakness or spiritual issue because people didn’t know any better, he explains, and that still has a hangover to some degree today even though science has proven otherwise. But the danger in viewing mental health issues as a weakness is that it can lead people to put off seeking treatment because they’re afraid of being judged, Rego says. Mental illness has a biological cause, like any other illness, Gail Saltz, M.D., a psychiatrist and the author of The Power of Different , tells SELF—people just don’t see physical ailments like heart disease in the same way. “This is a ‘brain difference’ that results in symptoms that cause suffering and which, if addressed and treated, can resolve or be managed,” she says. “To call it a weakness is medically incorrect, and it also perpetuates stigma and shame.” Experts stress that mental health should be viewed in a similar way as physical health, and that includes doing things now to boost your mental health in the future. “People can think preventatively about how to care for their mental health,” Saltz says, and that means engaging in regular exercise to boost your mood and manage your stress , avoiding using alcohol for self-medication, getting plenty of sleep, and relying on a support system of family and friends when necessary. Licensed clinical psychologist Alicia H. Clark , Psy.D., says that everyone suffers from mental health issues like anxiety, sadness , and a bad mood on occasion. “When these experiences don’t impact your ability to carry out your daily obligations and responsibilities, they are considered ‘normal,’ ” she explains to SELF. “When symptoms get in the way of living your life, this is a sign of something bigger going on.” It’s time to seek help if you experience difficulty sleeping , eating, concentrating, or finding joy in otherwise joyful things, Clark says, adding that treatments to help are “readily available and effective.\" Whatever you do, don’t put off visiting a mental health professional, even if you’re not sure you need to. “When in doubt, reach out,” Rego says.
