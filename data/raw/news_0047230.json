He previously expressed skepticism about scientific evidence showing the planet is heating up and that humans are to blame. However, during his Senate confirmation hearing last month, he said he disagreed with Trump's past statements that global warming is a hoax.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:25:12.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
