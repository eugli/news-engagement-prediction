(ABC News: Patrick Rocca, file photo) \nJustice Lex Lasry said it seemed like a very long time for the community to wait for the justice system to run its course. \n\"It's hard to imagine that a thousand witnesses, given the direct nature of the evidence that exists, would need to give evidence,\" he said. \nJustice Lasry said the court was anxious to ensure the trial was brought on as quickly as possible. \nGargasoulas is yet to face a committal hearing in the magistrates court, which will occur before the case proceeds to Supreme Court trial. \nHis defence lawyer, Megan Casey, told the court she was unable to provide any input at this stage as to how the case may progress. \nAnother Supreme Court hearing will be scheduled later this year for another update to be provided. \nGargasoulas is due to return to the magistrates court in August.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:50:58.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
