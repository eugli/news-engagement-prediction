I can see virtually any movie at any time by logging into Netflix, renting one from iTunes, or by scouring the dark corners of the web (not recommended). But I'd be lying if I said that this convenience hasn't tarnished the romance of renting a movie at the local video store. Few joys in life compare to those bygone days of strolling the aisles of colorful VHS covers to find the perfect one to take home for the night, which is why I've come up with this list of the movies you always rented at Blockbuster . \nRenting movies at Blockbuster in the '90s was quite the experience. So many titles fighting for your attention on the outer perimeter of the store where the new releases resided, many of which were always missing from the shelves and replaced with an image, meaning that some other kid had beaten you to the punch. Sometimes you'd venture toward the middle of the store, hoping to find a hidden gem tucked away among the genres (the comedy section was always where I seemed to end up). So take a trip down memory lane and see how many of these classics you rented back in the day . 1 'Jumanji' ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:47:03.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
