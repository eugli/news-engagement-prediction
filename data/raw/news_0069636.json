We've had a lot of fun this summer seeking out the Best Places to Eat Ice Cream in Kansas City. From frozen custard, gelato and iced treats to the good ol' fashioned stuff, we've complied the Top 10 Best Places to Eat Ice Cream (and other frozen goodies) around town. 1. Murray's Ice Cream and Cookies \nMurray's Ice Cream and Cookies, located in Westport (next to Californo's) has that old ice cream parlor feel and the best of the cold stuff making it the KC Guide's Top Pick. There are so many things to choose from at Murray's it's hard to decide. From rich, homemade ice cream and a malt-ish Lumpy to a Smooshie with ingredients you can mix in-a trip to Murray's is a little bit of heaven. Location: 4120 Pennsylvania Ave, in Westport. \ncontinue reading below our video America's Best Foodie Cities 2. Glace Artisan Ice Cream (Christopher Elbow) \nAfter a successful test run last summer, hometown chocolatier Christopher Elbow announced that he'd be delighting Kansas Citians full time with an opening of Glace Artisan Ice at 50th and Main (between Spin and the firestation). It's here you'll find the rich, unusual and flavorful combinations Elbow is known for in his artisian chocolates--all perfectly confected in a frozen treat. With fun flavors like fleur de sel carmel (one of my fave chocolates), carmelized banana, and pineapple cilantro sorbet, the all natural ingredients make Glace a summer must. More » 3. Fresher than Fresh Snow Cones \nThe adorable LindsayLaricks will have her Shasta filled to the rim with her delish Fresher than Fresh Snow Cones--which will reappear on the Westside on Sunday's (at the garden park @ 17th and Summit) and in the Crossroads on First Friday's . The all natural snow cones use fresh fruit and herbs--our faves were watermelon basil, espresso and Mexican cane sugar and lemon prickly pear...or sample in a flight of five. More » 4. Foo's Fabulous Frozen Custard \nOne thing's for sure, Foo's Frozen Custard is FABULOUS. So fab in fact, that I can't drive by the Brookside spot without making a stop (yes, even when it's snowing out). Reminiscent of the Mom and Pop shops of lore, they use the freshest ingredients and say no to preservatives, making Foo's the KC's Guides Top Pick. If their famed concretes or Foo's Favorite Sundaes don't win you over with one bite you can make your own... Location:6235 Brookside Plaza More » 5. The Sweet Guy \nAs if The Sweet Guy doesn't do enough with his wonderful desserts, tempting drinks and truffles to die for...he chimes in with the wonderful world of Gelato. The hip Parkville confectonist has a yummie tiramasu that is a regular fave. Location: 10 Main Street, Parkville. 6. Balsano's Gelato Cafe \nBalsano's recently relocated from 45th St. to it's new locale on the Plaza's famed Ward Parkway and trust me, this gelato will make you down right giddy on a hot day. While they've got all the classics-but fantastic flavs like choco-buttered-rum, tiramisu and malted milk ball are so rich, sweet and delish..one taste and you'll be staring at the bottom of your cup before long. Location: 428 Ward Parkway 7. Paleteria Tropicana \nWhen it's as hot as blazes in Kansas City, what do you want more than anything? A popsicle. Head to this great little joint on SW Boulevard...Paleteria Tropicana. Paleteria (popsicle) has everything from mango-pineapple to the hotter than hot mango-chile which will make you hotter than you already are. \n5 area locations. More » 8. Poppy's Ice Cream and Coffee House \nThis cute little shop in downtown Lee's Summit is a hidden gem loved by locals since it's inception in Raytown in the 90's. With everything from concretes and custard to scoops and shakes, the sweet stuff is made with all natural ingredients in house--resulting in some seriously great tasting sweet stuff. Flavors change on a regular basis, and range from the usual (strawberry) and the interesting (brown sugar/sour cream), to the deeeelish (red velvet cake)--all of which are mouth-watering. 9. Sheridan's Frozen Custard \nIf the line wrapped around any of Sheridan's many KC locations is any indication of how good it is....Sheridan's made from scratch custard is the place to go on any hot day. What started in 1998 by KC Custard lover Jim Sheridan, has boomed into a Custard mecca throughout the metro (and has locations out of state!). It's the Mom and Pop shop with a clean and shiny drive-thru...and they even have doggie cones! Locations: 13 Locations throughout the KC Metro). Try: A Mount Rush S'more...yum! 10. Dippin' Dots \nThese flash frozen little morsels are tasty treat rain, shine, or 100 degrees outside. Ahhh...Dippin' Dots, the strange yet satisfying ultra cold followed by melting ice cream and a brain freeze. While you can't find Dippin' Dots just everywhere--they are found at certain spots around the Metro. \nDippin' Dots in KC:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:37:40.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
