(PTI) BMC Election Results 2017: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote Facebook blog taking a dig at Congress after the Bharatiya Janata Party’s big win in Maharashtra civic polls. He said that parties which adopt dynastic succession as an alternative to merit-based leadership, suffer from a natural political disadvantage. “In Odisha, Congress got squeezed out of the contest. In Maharashtra,it got pushed to 3rd or 4th place in most cities,” said Jaitley. He invoked PM Narendra Modi ordered note ban and wrote that, “Congress party’s stand on demonetisation of high value currency notes is costing it dearly.” Jaitley congratulated the BJP karyakartas and people of Maharashtra for ensuring an emphatic victory for BJP in the civic polls.\nCongress’ washout from national political scene is a natural outcome of a decade in scandals coupled with its disruptive role in Parliament.\n— Arun Jaitley (@arunjaitley) February 23, 2017", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/arunjaitley/status/834753981008076800"], "published": "2017-02-24T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:36:39.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
