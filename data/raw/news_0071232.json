You can find an apartment on your own for under a grand — if you know where to look CBC News Posted: Feb 22, 2017 6:41 AM ET Last Updated: Feb 22, 2017 6:41 AM ET From bachelor pads to a motorhome, you can find a lot of diversity under a grand in Toronto's rental market. \nFinding an apartment in Toronto can be extra tricky if you're on a tight budget. \nThe average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is close to $1,800 a month, according to the Toronto Real Estate Board, but what if you're hoping for a solo spot under a grand? \nWe rounded up apartments across the city that are actually renting for under $1,000 a month, according to their listing price. \nKeep in mind, these prices and details are all based on online listings. \nCBC Toronto can't vouch for the accuracy of each post — and it's always worth checking out rentals in person. Bachelor pad in Woodbine Gardens \nNumber of bedrooms: Bachelor-style room Location: East York Price: Upwards of $995/month \nThis Padmapper find is a cozy little bachelor pad on Stag Hill Drive, a street by Taylor Creek in Woodbine Gardens, a neighbourhood north of the Danforth. (PadMapper) \nLike most bachelor units, it's not a lot of space but the finishes look like a step up from many apartment buildings — note the sleek floors and stainless steel appliances. \nAll the suites are \"fully renovated\" and \"modernized,\" the listing boasts. (PadMapper) \nThe building is a bit of a hike to the nearest subway — roughly a half-hour walk, or a more-than-20-minute bus ride — but just a short car ride away from the Don Valley Parkway. (PadMapper) Junior 1-bedroom at Yonge and St. Clair \nNumber of bedrooms: One Location: Yonge and St. Clair Price: $925/month \n\"Small but cozy\" is how this ViewIt listing sells this junior one-bedroom unit found on a residential street in midtown. (ViewIt) \nIt's definitely a tiny space — looks like the fridge doesn't even fit inside the little kitchen nook — but there's lots of charm, thanks to the moulding and hardwood floors. (ViewIt) \nOne thing to keep in mind: The on-site laundry takes coins, and tenants pay their own hydro and gas for the stove. \nSo the price will end up being a little bit higher than it seems on the surface.
