Jurgen Klopp sends warning to his Liverpool flops after Leicester loss \nMourinho’s set to be given significant funds to invest in the side again and the Red Devils are expected to pursue a deal for Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann. \nWho the club are able to bring in could depend on qualification for the Champions League but Mourinho says he will use his cash on just two or three players. Pogba and Ibrahimovic both arrived last summer (Picture: Getty) \n‘The next push is the next transfer window. We didn’t use it in the winter and we are obviously going to use it in the summer and trust the players we have,’ Mourinho told Sky Sports. \n‘We will keep a huge percentage of the players we have at this moment in the squad. We need the next push. \n‘If possible [to complete signings quickly in the summer], it is better. If you can start the pre-season with your squad it is obviously better \n‘I think we will be ready in July to open the door for two or three good players to help us to improve our level \n‘I always say that the market closes on August 31 when you are already playing matches, so it is not the best moment to do it. But sometimes deals are so difficult to do that sometimes the people responsible need one more day, one more week and it goes until the end.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:55:14.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
