He said the attempt to go to the UARB is a test case and the outcome would impact what happens next with the other businesses.\nRepeated construction delays Respondents named in the statement of claim include the city, attorneys general for Nova Scotia and Canada, the Halifax Convention Centre Corporation, project developer Argyle Developments Inc. and parent company Rank Incorporated.\nThe city has previously maintained the Expropriation Act doesn't apply in this case , something a spokesperson repeated in an email Monday.\n\"We will be defending the claim in the normal course,\" Tiffany Chase said in an email.\nWagner said governments are liable because they set the parameters under which the project could go ahead.\nExpected opening in December Construction work began in 2012 on the project.\nThe filing notes the Nova Centre, which is to include the new convention centre, a hotel and two office towers, was originally scheduled to open in January 2016. There have been three subsequent delays and the current expected opening is this December.\nConstruction \"has had a significant, sustained, unreasonable impact\" on the restaurant's business, according to the statement.\nThe Wooden Monkey's statement of claim mentions construction-related dirt and noise and dust have interfered with the restaurant's business. (Yvonne Colbert/CBC)\nThat includes repeated interference with electricity, water, internet, garbage and phone service, a \"severe reduction\" in available parking, blocked and/or obstructed pedestrian access, construction-related dirt, noise and dust, and interference with the seasonal patio.\nAll of it, the statement says, has contributed to ongoing losses and yet none of the respondents were prepared to discuss some form of compensation under the Expropriation Act.\n\"These businesses are not looking for all the things they have lost, but rather, to be fairly compensated so they can live to [see] a better day,\" said Wagner.\nQuestion of jurisdiction Wagner said everyone should expect to experience some inconvenience due to construction and the city's development, but this project has stretched \"into a realm where there's really been very little planning and proactive activity to mitigate the substantial losses being experienced.\"\nIt's Wagner's hope a hearing could happen before the end of the summer. However, there's a question related to jurisdiction that must be settled first.\nWagner said that question could impact what happens next.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:31:06.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
