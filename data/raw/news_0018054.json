It is a court order and we can challenge it and we will challenge it to the highest court of authority,” Mr. Sanusi said. \nHe added that while the legal battle would be on one front, the parties had agreed that Arik Air would continue to run without any disruption. \nAlso speaking, Mr. Opasanya said AMCON was on a rescue mission to re-position the embattled airline. \nMr. Opasanya said :”AMCON has been a creditor to Arik for sometime. It also has security over substantial parts of the assets of Arik. \n“The debt of Arik to AMCON has not been paid and huge sums of money is owed. \n“So AMCON, having consulted widely with government authorities, has decided to appoint me to preside over the affairs of Arik. \n“So we have come to supervise the operation, sustain the operation, improve services and ensure that we support Arik with people of deep knowledge, experience and commitment in the airline industry.” \nAccording to him, Arik plays a pivotal role in the airline industry and many Nigerians are currently drawing their means of livelihood from the company. \n“We have addressed the workers and the management and we want to assure other stakeholders and members of the public that the desire of AMCON is to keep the airline flying. \n“AMCON is willing to support the operation of Arik and together with the government, work to meet the immediate essential needs of the company, “he said. \nOn his part, Mr. Ilegbodu said Arik had 28 aircraft in its fleet but only 10 are currently being used for operations. \nHe said his duty as technical consultant was to get to the root of the problems bedeviling the airline to ensure its sustainability.
