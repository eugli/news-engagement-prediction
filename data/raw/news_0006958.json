The party is sponsored by Intergalactic Krewe Of Chewbacchus , the sci-fi-themed spin-off of the city’s famous parade krewes that “unites Star Wars Freaks, Trekkies, Whovians, Mega-Geeks, Gamers, Cosplayers, Circuit Benders, Cryptozoologists, UFO Conspiracy Theorists, Mad Scientists, and the rest of Super Nerdom.” Sounds fun, right? Well, it is. If you don’t believe us, ask Google Image Search . \nBut what about the other 364 days in the year? Who will carry on the noble cause of getting shit-faced and letting out a Wookiee roar massive enough to rattle the heavens once Mardi Gras has come and gone? The patrons of the Frenchmen Street location of NOLA-based hot dog chain Dat Dog , that’s who. The restaurant is opening a special dining room dedicated to the boozy weirdos of the IKOC, anchored by a shrine to Kashyyyk’s most famous son, Chewbacca, over the bar. (You can see it in the image above.) As well as serving as a home base for the IKOC’s revelry every February, the room will host fundraisers and events for the STOMP Troopers , a program that makes marching in parades accessible to kids with autism. \nThe Wookiee shrine (seriously, that’s what the press release calls it) will open after a special toast during the Intergalactic Krewe Of Chewbacchus parade —this year’s theme: “The Revel Alliance”—on February 18. You can visit it during regular business hours after that. \nSubmit your Great Job, Internet tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:33:20.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
