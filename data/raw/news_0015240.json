Rec Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports Hassan Whiteside didn’t make the All-Star team, not as a reserve and certainly not as a starter. But that doesn’t mean he’s not one of the premier centers the NBA has to offer. And if that happened to slip your mind, Whiteside reminded you with a dominating performance in the Miami Heat ’s 125-102 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night. Without Joel Embiid, who sat out with a right knee injury, Whiteside methodically picked the Sixers apart for 30 points on a 14-for-17 shooting night. The 7’0 center also grabbed 20 rebounds and blocked three shots in 27 minutes on the floor, playing just the first three quarters as Miami took a 100-75 lead into the fourth. The Heat center joined an exclusive group on Saturday, becoming just the second player since the 1983-84 season to record at least 30 points and 20 rebounds in no more than 27 minutes in a game. The only other player to do so was Bill Laimbeer in the 1984-85 season. Hassan Whiteside has 30 points & 20 rebounds in 27 MIN. Only Bill Laimbeer has had as many PTS & REB in 27 or fewer minutes since 1983-84. — Kristian Winfield (@Krisplashed) February 5, 2017 Miami is on a tear, riding a 10-game winning streak, and their starting center hadn’t scored more than 19 points until facing the Embiid-less Sixers. The Heat were happy to welcome Whiteside back. Next Up In NBA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T05:23:13.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
