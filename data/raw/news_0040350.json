Called the Unlimited Power Prepaid, the new prepaid plan, as its name suggests, comes packed with unlimited data for you to use on some of the most popular social networks available. \nThe new Unlimited Power Prepaid gives you “unlimited power” with a brand new service called App-Onz, which offers unlimited data on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. This means that you can share, upload and view posts on these networks without having to worry about your data quota. “We are extremely excited about our new prepaid pack, Unlimited Power. It really does pack a puch with the App-Onz bundling. We hope our prepaid customers will be able to share unlimited excitement on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter with their unlimited App-Onz data.” – Jasmine Lee, Chief Marketing Officer of U Mobile. \nSo, what’s the catch? According to U Mobile, there is no fine print for App-Onz and customers will enjoy the unlimited data “anytime, anywhere”. This is in-line with the telco’s approach to give customers what they really want and need from their data experience.
