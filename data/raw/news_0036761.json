Shah has termed the SP-Congress tie up as an alliance between two corrupt families. (PTI) \nUttar Pradesh poll outcome will bring about a major change in the course of country’s politics BJP chief Amit Shah said on Saturday even as he termed the fledgling SP-Congress alliance a “last minute stop gap arrangement”. \n“A BJP tsunami will soon hit Uttar Pradesh, heralding a major change in the course of country’s politics,” he said, discounting as “remote” the possibility of the state throwing up a hung Assembly. \n“The results will bring to a halt dynastic and caste- based politics,” he told a press conference in Gorakhpur in the midst of hectic electioneering in the poll-bound state. \nShah said the name of Congress president is decided at the time of birth itself. “This is not the case with BJP,” he said. \nReferring to the pre-poll tie up between Samajwadi Party and Congress, he said, “It was a last minute stop gap arrangement. An alliance is always between two political parties and ideologies. This is an unholy alliance and looks like an alliance between two corrupt families.” \n“By forging an alliance of two corrupt families, Akhilesh Yadav has already conceded defeat,” he said. \nShah also said Ram Manohar Lohia, a socialist, fought Congress throughout his life, but SP forged an alliance with the same party. \nTaking a jibe at Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, the BJP chief said, “If he was that confident of winning the assembly elections solo, he would have never joined hands with Congress. By doing so, he has accepted defeat even when elections are not midway through. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:43:33.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
