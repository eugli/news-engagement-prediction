Email \nFears are also growing rapidly one of the blazes could spread to the Craggy Range forestry block, a 200-hectare area of 18-year-old pine trees. TOMMY LIVINGSTON/FAIRFAX NZ \nA grass fire on the way to Waimarama Beach, Hawke's Bay. \nHawke's Bay Civil Defence declared the state of emergency on Monday afternoon and asked members of the public to stay away from the fires. \nREAD MORE: \nProperties were being evacuated along Waimarama Rd, near Havelock North, where one house had been destroyed and a second was under threat by a large grass fire. FRANCIS DE JAGER \nFire burns through the Tuki Tki Valley in Hawke's Bay. \nWildfires were also burning on Colin White Rd in Poukawa, Endersly Rd in Havelock North and Puketitiri - all fanned by the region's strong winds and high temperatures. \nThe cause of the fires were still unknown. \nHastings Fire Service said about 18 tankers and fire trucks, along with seven helicopters and monsoon buckets, were called to the blaze on Waimarama Rd. Tiaan jarman \nFire in Hawkes Bay's Tuki Tuki area \nSenior station officer Colin Littlewood said winds shifting everywhere were making the fire very difficult and dangerous to fight. Ad Feedback \nThere had been numerous horse rescues as well as house evacuations, he said. \nHe confirmed one house had been claimed by the flames, while a wall in another house had been destroyed before the fire service saved the remainder of the building. TOMMY LIVINGSTON/FAIRFAX NZ \nA grass fire on the way to Waimarama Beach, Hawke's Bay. \nAt 11am this morning the area burnt by the Waimarama Rd fire was estimated as 50 hectares. \nLittlewood said fire fighters were originally battling a 1.5km front, but that had grown much larger by 4pm. He was unsure just how big the fire had grown. \nThe gutted remains of one hilltop house could be seen from Waimarama Rd. \nHelicopters fighting the blaze were taking water from the near-by Tukituki River. \nEmergency services closed the Matangi Rd intersection, preventing vehicles travelling to the coastal Ocean and Waimarama beach communities. \nA Hastings District Council spokeswoman said schools in Hastings and Havelock North with students from these areas had been contacted and arrangements would be made, should the children not be able to return home this afternoon. \nThe council was advising people who are driving on the road out to Waimarama to not go any further as the road was being used as a fire break. \nThis left the coastal communities cut off from main centres in both vehicle access and power. \nElectricity network operator Unison switched off power to the area at the request of the fire service about 11am. This left 700 surrounding homes and businesses without electricity. \nA company spokesman said customers should be prepared for an extended period of power outages as crews could not enter the area to inspect powerlines until the blaze was brought under control and the level of damage was unknown. \nANOTHER THREE FIRES \nMeanwhile the blaze on Colin White Rd was being fought by rural Hawke's Bay crews, plus staff from Auckland and Taranaki. \nSo far 270 hectares of grass land was burnt and one house nearest the fire was self-evacuated. \nA council spokeswoman said concern about this blaze will rise if the forecast northwesterly winds rise and send the fire towards Te Hauke village. \nPhone calls and door knocks were being made to residents in the immediate area advising them the risk was currently low, but to be prepared with a carry bag holding essentials, she said. \nThe grass fire on Endsleigh Rd was being attended by the Fire Service but further details were not available. \nIt was co9ol and drizzling in the Ripia stream area around Te Pohue and Puketitiri where the fourth fire was burning. \nThis was being monitored but resources were being used at the other fires.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:13:39.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
