Already, McClanahan devotees from Australia to India and beyond have come through to see the collection, LaRue said. During a recent visit to the café, Jaime Millner, 30, told CNN she identifies with McClanahan's character. \"She's sassy, she's fun, she's intelligent, she owns every bit of herself, makes no apologies,\" Millner said of Blanche. \"That's why I love her.\" Photos: Take a look inside the new 'Golden Girls'-themed cafe The sign outside Rue La Rue Café in New York City carries a line from \"The Golden Girls\" theme song, \"Thank You for Being a Friend.\" Hide Caption Photos: Take a look inside the new 'Golden Girls'-themed cafe A Hollywood-style star greets visitors to the Rue La Rue Café.
