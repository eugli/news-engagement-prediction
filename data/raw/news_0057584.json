The system recently integrated with F-35s, allowing an F-35 to guide a missile fired from a land-based version of a navy ship to hitting a target. \nBusiness Insider previously reported that NIFC-CA can help F-35s take enemy targets and airspace without firing a shot, but remarks from Cmdr. David Snee, director for integration and interoperability at the warfare integration directorate, recently revealed that NIFC-CA can help save the Navy billions. \n“Right now we’re in a world where if I can’t see beyond the horizon then I need to build in that sort of sensing and high-tech effort into the weapon itself,” Snee told conferene attendees, as noted by USNI News . \n“But in a world where I can see beyond the horizon and I can target, then I don’t need to spend a billion dollars on a weapon that doesn’t need to have all that information. I just need to be able to give the data to the weapon at the appropriate time.” \nAccording to Snee, with an integrated network of sensors allowing the Navy to see beyond the horizon, the costly sensors and guidance systems the US puts on nearly every single bomb dropped could become obsolete.

The Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group is underway continuing training before deploying to the western Pacific Ocean and U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. \nIn the scenario described by Snee, today’s guided or “smart bombs” could be replaced with bombs that simply receive targeting info from other sensors, like F-35s or E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft. \nEssentially, the “smart” part of the weapon’s guidance would remain on the ship, plane, or other sensor node that fired them, instead of living on the missile and being destroyed with each blast. \nThe Navy would have to do extensive testing to make sure the bombs could do their job with minimal sensor technology. But the move could potentially save billions, as the US military dropped at least 26,000 bombs in 2016, the vast majority of which contained expensive sensors. \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
