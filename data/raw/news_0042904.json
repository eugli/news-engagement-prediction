London Fashion Week has only just begun, but millennial sweethearts Rocco Ritchie and his girlfriend, Kim Turnbull, have been turning heads with their coordinating looks. Arriving arm in arm to the Versus show tonight, Ritchie and Turnbull had an adorable twinning front-row moment with their take on the brand’s streetwise signatures. Ritchie sported the swirling blue brocade bomber jacket with wide-leg pants and bright red sneakers, while Turnbull wore a sleek black windbreaker with towering platforms; they complemented each other without seeming matchy-matchy. Those harmonious style statements aren’t limited to Fashion Week. When it comes to clothes, they’re often in sync, whether it be a casual coffee run or a couple selfie captured on Instagram. A trip to the premiere of Reebok’s Classic short film last week meant a pair of logo-covered jackets, while a stroll in the chilly London weather last month called for matching down coats. Ritchie and Turnbull are right at home in the low-key staples most teenagers love, but they’re more than willing to get dressed up for big events, too. Donatella Versace’s latest show was certainly a chic reason for them to break out the heels and the formal trainers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:16:39.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
