They were monitored in an MRI machine while played an assortment of sounds, some neutral, some simply regarded as “unpleasant,” and some thought to be trigger sounds. The published report, found here in Current Biology , saw that those suffering from misophonia demonstrated a spike in brain activity, most often anger, when played the trigger sounds. \nWitness an extreme case of misophonia in this video from ABC News: \nAnother study found that 80% of trigger sounds emanated from the mouth and 60% of them were repetitive, which would explain why habits like gum-snapping, lip-smacking, or even heavy breathing can cause such ire in others. \nSo while you don’t need a scientific reason to be upset at someone for eating loudly, you might have one. Which could be handy if you ever find yourself on trial for strangling that guy on the airplane next to you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T11:31:55.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
