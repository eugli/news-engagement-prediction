Our country's so innocent?\" he told Fox's Bill O'Reilly in a taped interview aired Sunday on the Super Bowl pregame show. \nMr Trump has long expressed a wish for better ties with Moscow, praised Mr Putin and signaled that US-Russia relations could be in line for a makeover, even after US intelligence agencies determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 US presidential campaign to help Mr Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Mr Putin has called Mr Trump a \"very bright and talented man. \" \nDuring Mr Putin's years in power, a number of prominent Russian opposition figures and journalists have been killed . \nIn the interview, Mr Trump says, \"I do respect him,\" then is asked why. \n\"I respect a lot of people, but that doesn't mean I'm going to get along with him. He's a leader of his country. I say it's better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all over the world - that's a good thing,\" Mr Trump said, using an acronym for Islamic State. \"Will I get along with him? I have no idea.\" \nO'Reilly then said about Mr Putin: \"But he's a killer, though. Putin's a killer.\" \nMr Trump responded: \"There are a lot of killers. We've got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country's so innocent?\" Watch | Donald Trump thinks he would get on well with Vladimir Putin 01:15 \nW hen O'Reilly says he doesn't know any government leaders who are killers, Mr Trump says \"take a look at what we've done, too. We've made a lot of mistakes\" and references the Iraq war claiming \" I've been against the war in Iraq from the beginning.\" \nIn a 2002 radio interview with Howard Stern Mr Trump was asked if he supported invading Iraq. \"Yeah I guess so,\" Mr Trump said. When the audio from the interview was unearthed in 2016 Mr Trump said he became an opponent by the time the invasion occurred. \nThe Kremlin had no immediate comment. Democrats and Republicans took issue with Mr Trump's comparison of Russia and the US. \n\"I really do resent that he would say something like that,\" said Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar on ABC's This Week. \nThe Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, distanced himself from the president. \n\"Putin's a former KGB agent. He's a thug. He was not elected in a way that most people would consider a credible election. The Russians annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine and messed around in our elections. And no, I don't think there's any equivalency between the way the Russians conduct themselves and the way the United States does,\" Ms McConnell told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \nO'Reilly also asked Mr Trump to back up his claims that some 3 million to 5 million illegal votes were cast in the election . Mr Trump didn't answer directly, but asserted that immigrants in the US illegally and dead people are on the voter rolls. \"It's really a bad situation, it's really bad,\" Mr Trump said. I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 25 January 2017 even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 25 January 2017 \nT here is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the November 8 election. Mr Trump won the Electoral College vote but lost the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes to Clinton. \nMr Trump recently announced on Twitter that he would call for a \"major investigation\" into voter fraud, but senior administration officials said last week that plans for Trump to take some type of executive action on the issue had been delayed. \nMr Trump said in the Fox News interview that he will set up a commission to be headed by vice president Mike Pence and \"we're going to look at it very, very carefully.\" \nMcConnell, meanwhile, said he saw no role for the federal government because states historically have handled voter fraud investigations. Watch | White House spokesman: Trump maintains belief in millions of illegal votes 00:31 \n\"There's no evidence that it occurred in such a significant number that would have changed the presidential election, and I don't think we ought to spend any federal money investigating that,\" McConnell told CNN. \"I think the states can take a look at this issue.\" \nO n other issues, Mr Trump said: California's consideration of legislation to create a statewide sanctuary for people living in the country illegally is \"ridiculous.\" He suggested withholding federal funding as possible punishment. Plans to enact a replacement for the Affordable Care Act could slip into next year. \"I would like to say by the end of the year, at least the rudiments, but we should have something within the year and the following year,\" Trump said. Living in the White House is \"a surreal experience in a certain way, but you have to get over it, because there's so much work to be done.\" \nThe Trump administration on Thursday revised recent US sanctions that had unintentionally prevented American companies from exporting certain consumer electronic products to Russia. The change allows companies to deal with Russia's security service, which licenses such exports under Russian law. The products were not intended to be covered by the sanctions the Obama administration imposed on December 29 after US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the presidential election. The White House denied it was easing sanctions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:49:06.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
