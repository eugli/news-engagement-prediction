(Hyoung Chang / AP) Associated Press \nEdward Tipper, a World War II paratrooper who was portrayed in the HBO mini-series \"Band of Brothers,\" has died at the age of 95. \nHe died Feb. 1 in the Denver suburb of Lakewood, his daughter said. \nTipper was a member of the famed Easy Company, part of the 101st Airborne Division, and parachuted into France as part of the June 6, 1944, Allied D-day invasion. \nThe company's exploits were retold in \"Band of Brothers,\" based on research by historian Stephen Ambrose. \nAmbrose died of cancer Saturday in Helena, Mont., his sister Stephenie Ambrose Tubbs said Tuesday. ... Read the story \nTipper was interviewed for the series and was portrayed by actor Bart Ruspoli. \nA few days after the parachute drop, Tripper's eye and leg were badly injured by a mortar shell and he was hospitalized for a year. \nTipper was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. \nDoctors gave him a list of things he couldn't do, but that became his checklist for things to master, his daughter said. \n\"He was defiant above all,\" Kerry Tipper, his daughter, told The Denver Post. \nHe took up handball, not because he liked it, but to prove he could do it, she said. \nHe was also an avid skier and kept that up into his 80s, she said.

That was two years and really six days starting on D-day,\" Kerry Tipper said. \"Teaching was 30 years.\" Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss \nAdele's big night at the Grammys , an overflowing dam threatens homes in Northern California , Santa Monica is set to approve the nation’s most extensive seismic retrofit plan , and L.A.
