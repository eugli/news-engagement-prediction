Papua New Guinea's Parliament has selected a new Governor-General for the country. MPs voted for Bob Dadae, a serving MP in the same party as Prime Minister Peter O'Neill. He received 55 votes in the 111-seat parliament, beating former defence force commander Ted Diro and former MP Timothy Bonga. Unlike in Australia, PNG's governor-general is elected by parliament rather than being appointed on the advice of the prime minister. Mr Dadae has served three terms as a Member of Parliament for Kabwum, in Morobe Province, and is a former minister for defence and former deputy speaker of parliament. Mr Dadae will be officially sworn into office on February 28, when current Governor-General Sir Michael Ogio's term expires. There were numerous calls for PNG's new governor-general to be a woman, but parliamentarians did not nominate any female candidates.
