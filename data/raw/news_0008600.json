SLOTNIK   Photo Kevin Geer, right, with Richard Kind in “Flyovers,” at the 78th Street Theater Lab in Manhattan in 2009. Credit Carol Rosegg Kevin Geer, a prodigious character actor best known for his work in theater, including roles on Broadway in the 2004 revival of “Twelve Angry Men” and Warren Leight’s family drama “Side Man,” died on Jan. 25 at his home in Manhattan. He was 64. The actor Michael Mastro, a friend who appeared with Mr. Geer in both those plays, said the cause appeared to be a sudden heart attack. A lanky actor with sharp features, Mr. Geer was an Off Broadway fixture who could command a stage. “Mr. Geer rages, goes to pieces and exudes roguish charm,” Alvin Klein wrote in The New York Times in reviewing his performance in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s “Anna Christie” in 1990 at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven. The playwright and director Kenneth Lonergan, a longtime friend who directed Mr. Geer in his 2012 comedy “ Medieval Play ” and his 2011 film “Margaret,” said in a phone interview on Wednesday that “it’s hard to imagine New York theater without him,” adding that Mr. Geer was more forceful on the stage than on the screen. “His film persona and his theater persona were very different,” said Mr. Lonergan, whose most recent film, “Manchester by the Sea,” has been nominated for several Academy Awards. “He was kind of an outsize performer in the theater and very quiet and contained in films.” Mr. Geer made his Broadway debut in 1988 as Mitch in a revival of Tennessee Williams’s “A Streetcar Named Desire,” which starred Blythe Danner and Aidan Quinn. He played one of the squabbling jurors in Scott Ellis’s production of “Twelve Angry Men” and a drug-addicted jazz trombonist in “Side Man,” both in its Off Broadway cast in 1998 and during its subsequent Broadway run, for which it won a Tony Award for best new play. In 2009 he was a laid-off factory worker in Jeffrey Sweet’s Off-Off Broadway drama “Flyovers.” On television, he had an emotional turn as an amnesiac sergeant on “M*A*S*H” in 1978 and later appeared on three different iterations of “Law & Order,” including a performance as a white supremacist who bombs a subway.
