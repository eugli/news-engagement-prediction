(Supplied: Danielle Hodgens/George/Kneipp) \nThe ultimate aim of the exhibition, which Ms Hodgens describes as \"a huge art project\", is to unmask medical professionals and show them doing the things they love to do with their spare time. \n\"The public can see that doctors and medical specialists who sometimes work 16 hours a day are human beings as well,\" Ms Hodgens said.
