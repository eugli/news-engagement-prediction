Apparently originating from Brazil, the photo shows the smartphone with a marketing cover over its display - thus, we can check out some of its highlight features. Until now, we assumed that the Moto G5 Plus would sport a 5.5-inch display, but the newly leaked image shows that the screen is actually a 5.2-inch one. This means that the Moto G5 Plus won't be significantly larger than the normal , 5-inch Moto G5 (which is expected to be launched alongside it). In any case, the screens of both models will offer 1080p resolutions.The G5 Plus is powered by a 2 GHz octa-core processor (probably a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625), further featuring NFC, fingerprint scanner, a 12 MP \"rapid focus\" rear camera, and a 3000 mAh battery with TurboPower quick charging. While this isn't confirmed by the new photo, the smartphone should have 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal memory, almost certainly running Android 7 Nougat. Both the Moto G5 Plus and Moto G5 will likely be announced at MWC 2017 on February 26 , and could hit shelves around the world as soon as March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:34:22.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
