After being arrested by the Dubai Police for his daring climb in 2014, he has gone ahead and sneaked into a construction site. In the recent video, he can be seen entering a tower under construction and jumping on a crane. He is heard saying,\"I am sure there are security guards but luckily there is a lot of place to hide here.It is like racing behind time as it is nearing sunset.\" Looking at the video, he looks to be hanging at a height of approximately 300 to 400 metres. He can be seen performing the stunt without any safety harness. Watch the video to see for yourself James was arrested in 2014 after he scaled Dubai's 413-metre Princess Tower in Dubai in 2014. \"People see the videos and think it looks dangerous, but what they don't see is the years of practice that go into my stunts. I trained and trained to be able to do what I do. I've trained the danger out of the situation,\" he was quoted saying in an interview earlier.
