It's no surprise that the hate groups who take these ideas to the extreme have also grown, capitalizing on the fear, anger and misinformation that has come with the election. \nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization identifies, tracks and raises awareness of hate groups, recently published a troubling report that found a second-year of growth in the number of hate groups across the United States. \nIn a nutshell, the report describes a disturbing reality: After half a century of relative dormancy, the radical right has reentered the mainstream. \nISLAMOPHOBIA: Woman charged with hate crime in vandalism at Davis mosque \nAccording to data collected by the organization, anti-Muslim hate groups tripled from 34 in 2015 to 101 in 2016. \nThe Islamophobia that spurred the creation of these groups also lead to a 67 percent increase in hate crimes against Muslims. \nHowever, Texas seems to be bucking the national trend, with the number of hate groups actually dropping from 84 to 55, according to Mark Potok, senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center and editor of the report. \nAlthough it may seem like good news, Potok said it was an accident of history, explaining that there's no correlation between a drop in the number of hate groups and the number of hate-related crimes. \n\"Fewer than 5 percent of hate crimes are committed by members of an organized hate group,\" said Potok. \"More or less, they're just every day people.\" \nThe drop in hate groups, he said, is because these organizations often go \"out of business\" due to their small numbers. \nThe senior fellow also pointed to the burning of two mosques in Austin and Victoria as extraordinary evidence for a \"very real, very traumatic nation wide trend.\" \nA new report released Wednesday states that hate groups are growing since the rise of President Trump, specifically groups characterized as anti-Muslim. The Southern Poverty Law Center releases an annual \"Year in Hate\" report, which tracks the size and number of known hate groups in the US. As reported by BuzzFeed, \"The number of anti-Muslim hate groups has nearly tripled, from 34 in 2015 to 101 in 2016. Hate groups in the US grew for a second year in a row. Media: MediaOS Video \nTOP AID: Things to know about Steve Bannon, Trump's controversial adviser \nAnd while the Texas numbers have fallen, the report seemed confident that President Donald Trump had electrified the radical right with his incendiary rhetoric. \n\"2016 was an unprecedented year for hate,\" Potok said in a prepared statement. \"The country saw a resurgence of white nationalism that imperils the racial progress we've made, along with the rise of a president whose policies reflect the values of white nationalists. In Steve Bannon, these extremists think they finally have an ally who has the president's ear.\" \nThe SPLC's new study also discovered that children were not shielded from the growing prejudice. In a survey of 10,000 educators, 90 percent said that the \"climate at their schools had been negatively affected by the campaign,\" while 80 percent said there was \"heightened anxiety and fear among students, particularly immigrants.\" \nHouston, despite its diverse population, is no exception. \nSpeaking to Houston Public Media , The Anti-Defamation League said the number hate-related incidents in the greater Houston area had reached 25 in the first few months of 2017-- nearly half the number the organization usually deals with over the entire year. \nClick through above to see hate groups found throughout Texas.
