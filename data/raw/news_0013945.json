It is not good enough and sums our season up at the moment. \n\"It is time for every single one of us - from the top to the bottom of this club - to stand up and be counted. If we don't we will be relegated, and obviously nobody wants that.\" \nLeicester's current form is a far cry from the fairytale story of 2015-16 that saw them defy all the odds to claim a maiden Premier League title as the usual candidates fell by the wayside. \nComparing the two campaigns is not helpful for Leicester, according to Schmeichel. \nHe added: \"Let's not talk about last season. It's gone, as you can clearly see. \n\"There are a lot of factors that go into it but this season has not been good right from the start.\" \nSome reports have suggested the mood in the Leicester dressing room has turned sour this season, but their goalkeeper insists the squad are all pulling in the same direction. \n\"I am not going to comment on newspaper speculation,\" said the Denmark international. \n\"I know what is going on in the dressing room, we are a group of players who low on confidence but not low on fight. We will fight to the end, whatever that might be. \n\"I can guarantee that every player in there is hurting. It is not a comfortable situation. We're the reigning champions and quite frankly it has been terrible, it has been embarrassing. And we have to improve right now.\" Related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T22:43:55.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
