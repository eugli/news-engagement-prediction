Shares \nIf you take any serious amount of photos in RAW format or shoot lots of video footage at, say, 4K resolution, then you need a speedy SD card. Being a kingpin of the memory business for a long time, Sony knows this better than most, and therefore has unveiled the “world’s fastest” SD card: the SF-G Series . \n(Read: that is, until a rival comes along and one-ups Sony in a matter of months. It never ends, really.) \nSony’s latest SD cards, aimed at media professionals (natch), boast write speeds of 299 MB/s – that’s megabytes per second, not megabits – and read speeds of 300 MB/s. (The next fastest SD card to date belongs to SanDisk with its 260 MB/s-writing Extreme Pro series.) \nThe firm chalks up this arguably massive increase to “unique firmware,” and … that’s it. \nWhile Sony is keeping mum on exactly how it crafted the speediest SD card yet, it has released a bunch more qualifying information you should know before picking up one of these bad boys.
