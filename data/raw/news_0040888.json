Christie Says posted by Justin King - share Michael Berry has drunk homemade moonshine from North Carolina with Robert Earl Keen, met two presidents with the same last name, been cussed at by Ron White in a tweet, been called the Czar of Talk Radio by a bunch of workin people who can skin a buck & run a trotline, crowd surfed at the House of Blues, has a word he created attributed to him in the Urban Dictionary, ran for mayor and was destroyed, attacked by the media and survived, killed 2 hogs with his first 2 shots from a moving helicopter, been featured on Good Morning America as tasteless for comments about a mosque at the site of 9/11, been boycotted by LULAC and the New Black Panther Party, had legal threats from CAIR, and loves bacon. His wife is smokin hot, doesn't nag him, and professes undying love, while cooking him hot meals & letting him smoke cigars & drink brown water in the house. His 2 boys, Michael T & Crockett, have been called the most wonderful kids ever (by him), and they're young enough to still think he's cool and are willing to be seen in public with him. Michael Berry has a beard you can hide a French car in and shows no signs of male pattern baldness, his testosterone levels are those of a 17-year-old and his bad cholesterol level is no longer near-fatal (both due to modern medicine), but he has untreated acid reflux that affects his voice on occasion.Named Top 25 talk hosts in America by NewsMax Magazine.
