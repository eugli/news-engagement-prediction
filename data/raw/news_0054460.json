And I never wanted to see it on TV.”\nShe skipped the 25th anniversary screening in New York in 2015, too.\n25 things you didn’t know about ‘Goodfellas’ \n“And finally I see it last summer, outdoors in LA” at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, she said. “Four thousand people, a full moon. And me.”\nBracco, who played Karen Hill, the wife of mobster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), said she never even auditioned for her role.\nThe 62-year-old actress also took some shots at President Trump. (Steve Granitz/WireImage) Instead, director Martin Scorsese remembered her from an “After Hours” audition five years prior.\n“Here’s the thing. My father was Italian-American and my mother was a war bride. English, from Oxford. And I was born in Brooklyn but we moved to a Jewish neighborhood on Long Island,” she told The Guardian . “So I knew the Italian world and the Jewish world. That helped. I am a true immigrant, Mr. Trump!”\nGoodfella Paul Sorvino says Trump is a fine fellow \nAs for the President, Bracco said she was never impressed.\n“I’ve met him in New York. Never my kind of guy. Always very arrogant. But it doesn’t feel like a different America yet, because we’re still protesting,” she said.\n“It’s white American men, middle-class but not as successful as they think they should be. They look at him and say, ‘My God, I wanna be like him. I want my own TV show. My own plane. My wife that never talks!’”\nTags: goodfellas ray liotta lorraine bracco movies Send a Letter to the Editor  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:05:01.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
