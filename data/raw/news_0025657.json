I have never knowingly spoken to Russian intelligence officers, and I have never been involved with anything to do with the Russian government or the Putin administration or any other issues under investigation today.\" \n\"It's not like these people wear badges that say, 'I'm a Russian intelligence officer,'\" he added. \nThe Times said US intelligence was investigating \"whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election.\" \nThe officials interviewed by the paper had so far seen no evidence suggesting that cooperation had existed. \nIn January, US intelligence officials said in a report that Russia intervened in the US electoral process at least in part to help Trump win. He has spoken often about the need for a closer relationship between the United States and Russia. - AFP/hs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:03:52.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
