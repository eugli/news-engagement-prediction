This particularly concerns Trump’s questioning of the ‘One China’ policy, which holds that Taiwan is not an independent state, but part of mainland China – as well as the president’s allegations of Chinese currency manipulations and unfair trading practices, which Trump promised the American public he would address. \nIn line with this, the US leader has promised to impose new trade tariffs on Beijing. \nThere is also the question of Chinese policies in the South China Sea, where it has been setting up a military presence by building artificial islets and laying claim to territories others in the region also contest.

Tokyo has been growing uneasy at Chinese actions and has been beefing up its own military with record financial injections. \n\"I made clear that our long-standing policy on the Senkaku Islands stands – the US will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands and as such Article 5 of the US-Japan Security Treaty applies,\" Mattis said at a press conference with his Japanese counterpart, Tomomi Inada. \nAccording to the treaty, the US can involve itself in defending Japan – including over the Senkakus, located in the East China Sea, and disputed with China, which refers to them as the Diaoyus. \nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry nonetheless said last week it is willing to establish closer ties to Washington in working to settle all manner of disputes. However, as Trump’s letter indicates, both sides are being cautious about cooperation at a time when unsolved diplomatic disputes still hang overhead. \nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned on Wednesday that neither country should be interested in a conflict. \n“For any sober-minded politician, they clearly recognize that there cannot be conflict between China and the United States because both will lose — and both sides cannot afford that,” the diplomat said after being asked about the possibility of war between the two nations during a press conference in Canberra, Australia, on Tuesday.
