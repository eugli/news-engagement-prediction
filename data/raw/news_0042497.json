Through his new documentary “BIOSLUDGED,” which will be released in 2017, Mike Adams informs the public about how the EPA and the government have unleashed a “devastating vector for bioterrorism against ourselves.” \nIt reveals the EPA’s fraudulent practices behind the legalization of biosolids which are now polluting America’s farmlands, playgrounds, and city parks with heavily contaminated industrial and human waste. (RELATED: Stay informed about biosludge at Biosludge.news .) \nThreatened by President Obamas’ office to be silenced by the IRS if he went public with the environmental crimes and fraudulent science of the EPA, the trailer for the upcoming new film “BIOSLUDGED” has finally been released earlier this month. Why we should fear the use of biosolids \nAs stated by Dr. Lewis, biosolids contain every toxic chemical, heavy metal, and pollutant known to cause adverse health effects. With no existing research proving the safety of biosludge, toxic waste materials keep ending up in our environment and food chain. (RELATED: Find more environmental news at Enviro.news.) \nYes, that’s correct. What you, and millions of other Americans, flush down the toilet eventually ends up back on your plate. Given the fact that the EPA is doing everything to silence whistleblowers, like Mike Adams and Dr. Lewis, it is clear that something is fishy and not quite right. \nDr. Lewis, formerly a senior-level research microbiologist at the EPA, was fired after publishing two articles in the high-impact journal Nature that raised serious concerns over the use of raw sewage sludge to fertilize our crops. \nIn an interview with Mother Earth News , Dr. Lewis said that the EPA’s 503 sludge rule only regulates nine of the 27 heavy metals found in sewage sludge and no toxic organic chemicals. He added that many of these chemicals – such as endocrine disruptors, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and plasticizers – are the worst of the worst. They show up in our food chain and are known to cause serious adverse effects in humans and animals alike. Regular exposure to these sewage toxins has shown to increase the risk of autism, ALS, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and other neurological disorders. EPA committed to protecting the environment and our health. Yeah right! \nWhile the EPA’s original mission was to provide solid science to protect the environment, the truth is that they are nothing more than a greedy puppet of the biosludge industry. When Mike Adams interviewed people who have been part of this industry, they told him that the city leaders get financial kickbacks from biosludge companies to keep their toxic operation running smoothly. \nThe government in its turn hires dodgy scientists who produce false scientific evidence to support government policies and industry practices. Speaking to Mike Adams in the BIOSLUDGED trailer, Dr. Lewis noted that any scientist who commits fraud or provides fake, untrustworthy data will be put in prison. However, when the false data is in the interest of the government and the industry, people are promoted and protected at the highest level. A sad truth with our health at stake. \nFor the sake of our children and their children, these whistleblowers must be heard, and immediate actions should be taken. Let us hope that the authorities don’t let these findings slip through the cracks of governmental and industry corruption again. Or “we may leave behind a toxic legacy for the generation to come,” as Mike Adams says in the trailer. \nSources:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:22:54.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
