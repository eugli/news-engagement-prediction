Sasikala had promised to break contact with her family members and also said that she had no ambitions either in the party or in the government. \n\nOPS used the same letter to attack saying that Sasikala has betrayed Amma at a press conference to show his strength to form the government. \n\nSasikala, expressing her unflinching loyalty, addressed Jayalalithaa as her elder sister (akka) in the 2012 letter. \n\nRead below what Sasikala wrote in 2012: \n\n\"Not even in my wildest dreams, I have thought of betraying 'akka'. For 24 years, I have been living under the same roof. I have no ambitions either in the party or in the government. I have always devoted my life to 'akka' and the rest of my life will be to serve her,\" she wrote. \"Only after coming out of Poes Garden, I became aware of the machinations of my relatives who have misused my proximity and brought disrepute to akka and the party. I have no role whatsoever in that. Hereafter, any relative, whosoever it might be, who had conspired against akka, will remain a persona non-grata for me as well,\" she said, expressing shock at the behind-the-scenes developments.
