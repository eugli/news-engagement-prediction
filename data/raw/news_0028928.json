Appearing on ITV's The Secret Life of Dogs, viewers gushed over the tiny crime-fighter, with one asking: 'Is there anything more inspirational?' Partner for the past ten years to Ohio County Sherriff, Dan McClelland, Midge has earned her spot on the team after a number of high profile busts. Dan says of his unusual choice in companion: 'It's not the most macho thing to be a police officer with a dog that might look like she might belong to Paris Hilton, but you don't have to be the biggest kid on the block to do good things.' Scroll down for video Ohio County Sherriff, Dan McClelland and his partner in crime Midge - who he has worked with for the past ten years on the police force Viewers were suitably impressed with tiny Midge's skills There's no doubt that big dogs - like the traditional German Shepherd - are more intimidating, but Midge proves why she is the perfect working partner. Aided by her nose that is sensitive enough to detect ten different types of narcotic, she can squeeze into the tiny corners other dogs just can't reach. The pooch is uniquely suited for her role as a police dog helping the team to hunt out drugs and fit in tiny spaces a traditional German Shepherd may not be able to While she might not be big enough to do crowd control or track the bad guy - her strength is her stature and ability to get into those tight spots.
