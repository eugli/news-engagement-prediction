The teen was shot as he tried to intervene, and was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. \n\"I call him my hero just for doing that,\" his friend Endy Herrera told KHOU . Javier Flores was fatally shot Wednesday night trying to protect his mother. (via GoFundMe) \nThe suspects fled empty-handed. They are believed to be black and 16 to 20 years of age, and driving in a tan or gold four-door sedan, according to Houston cops. \n\"They're out here working and doing what they're supposed to be doing and then these two suspects came in and cut that short and certainly there was nothing in there that was worth the life of the 18 year old,\" Crowder told KHOU. \nAuthorities hope Flores' mother can help them with information about the suspects, but it's \"very hard for her to talk about this,\" Crowder said. It was near closing time at the Subway when the fatal shooting took place. (ABC13) \nAnother Subway in Houston was robbed after the fatal shooting, and the descriptions of the suspects matched the first crime, according to KHOU. \nSkydiving instructor makes on-ground save after child falls \nAnyone with information should contact the Houston Police Department at (713) 308-3600 or Crime Stoppers at (713) 222-TIPS. A GoFundMe page is raising money for Javier's family. \n\"There's no way the community's going to heal, as long as this is occurring,\" Connie Herrera, who lives near the restaurant, told KHOU. \"As you can see, someone really does pay the price.\" \nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:50:32.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
