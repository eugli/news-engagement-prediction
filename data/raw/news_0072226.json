If your nationality is not on the following list, then you should contact a Moroccan Embassy and apply for a visa. \nYou do not need a tourist visa if you belong to one of the following countries: Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Congo (Rep. of), Cote d'Ivoire, Denmark, European Union , Finland, Guinea, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Korea (Rep. \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Tips to Make Coach Feel Like First Class of), Kuwait, Libya, Liechtenstein, Mali, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, New Zealand , Niger, Norway, Oman, Peru, Philippines, Puerto Rico , Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia , Senegal, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates , United Kingdom, United States of America, and Venezuela. \nYour passport must be valid for at least six months after you enter Morocco. You will get a stamp in your passport upon entry into the country (make sure you get it) which will allow you to stay for 90 days. No entry fees are charged. \nHealth and Safety \nAs with most destinations in Africa you have to careful about what you drink and eat in order to avoid stomach upsets. Buying food from street vendors carries some degree of risk and tap water should not be drunk. There is plenty of bottled water available throughout the country. Luckily Morocco is basically malaria-free . There are a few areas near the border with Mauritania that can harbor malaria but it's an unlikely destination even for the hardiest of travelers. \nImmunizations \nNo vaccinations are required by law to enter Morocco but Typhoid and Hepatitis A are two vaccinations that are strongly recommended. It is also a good idea to be up to date with your polio and tetanus vaccines. \nTerrorism \nA series of terrorist attacks took place in Casablanca in May 2003, killing 45 people. The targets included hotels, cafes and other areas which tourists frequent. The Moroccan authorities claim to have caught the perpetrators, but there is still some risk of further attacks. Despite the unpopularity of the American presence in Iraq and its support for Israel, attacks against US citizens have not been reported. Most Moroccans, to their credit, do make a distinction between US Government policies and US citizens. \nCrime \nViolent crime is still quite rare in Morocco but getting harassed by \"guides\" and petty theft is fairly common. Avoid walking alone at night especially in unlit areas and on the beach. Take care of your valuables and don't flaunt your jewellery. \nDrugs \nMorocco has strict penalties for those caught purchasing or using drugs including \"kif\" as the local marijuana or hashish is called. That said, \"kif\" is smoked by a sizeable percentage of the Moroccan male population and many, young travelers in particular, visit Morocco with this in mind. Just be careful. The Rif mountains, where most of the marijuana is grown, is notorious for forcing their wares on unsuspecting tourists and the police are in on the scam. Do not buy \"kif\" from anyone who approaches you (and you will be approached) it is usually of inferior quality and you don't want to spend a lot of time with these folks. For more information I have an article about smoking hashish in Morocco . \nWomen Travelers \nMorocco is an Islamic country so be modest in what you wear. No short skirts, shorts or tank tops. Wear a bikini or swimsuit only at a pool or on a beach. You'll attract attention regardless what you wear, just ignore it and move on, most of it is harmless. More information on women traveling alone in Africa . \nGay Travelers \nHomosexuality is considered a criminal offence in Morocco (so are sexual relations outside of marriage for that matter). So just be careful of overt displays of public affection, although handholding between men is very common; you'll probably get fewer looks than if you were wandering around holding hands in some towns back home. \nWhen to Go to Morocco \nAs with many destinations the weather usually determines the best time to travel to Morocco. During the winter months, from November to March, it can get quite cold and rainy especially in the Atlas mountains. Click here for average temperatures for all major towns and tourist destinations in Morocco. If you are leaving soon, check today's temperatures in Rabat , Marrakech and Agadir . \nThe peak tourist season in Morocco is July and August. If you want to avoid the crowds and the heat, travel before or after this time. If you are traveling during these months then be sure to make some of your hotel bookings in advance especially along the coasts.
