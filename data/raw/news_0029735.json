On the other hand, Lukas performed with an eventful night to come; “7 Years” is nominated for both record of the year and song of the year, with the results ahead later in the show. \nCheck out their performance below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:44:24.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
