In total, more than 200,000 have been affected by the storm and its aftermath.\nSonia Mallet was happy to see an armoured vehicle outside her Shippagan home on Tuesday. (CBC)\n\"It was really fantastic, the community, all the help we had,\" said Mallet, as troops busily used chainsaws to cut trees that broke under the weight of heavy ice and clear the debris. \"It was unbelievable. Even the army in my yard, I can't believe it.\"\nSgt.

Joseph Beckwith said he and his colleagues are 'glad to be out in the community and helping out.'
