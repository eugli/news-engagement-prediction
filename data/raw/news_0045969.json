That's well below the statewide inventory of 3.3 months at the end of 2016. \nJim Gaines, Ph.D., chief economist with the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University, explained, \n\"The 2017 Texas housing market is projected to keep pace with last year's strong levels, but it may be difficult to match 2016 levels due to current housing supply levels,\" said Dr. James Gaines, chief economist with the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. \"Household incomes are rising at a disproportionally low rate than home prices, creating housing affordability challenges across the state. \n\"In housing development, labor shortages and regulatory barriers are slowing construction and in turn, driving up new home prices.\" Source: Texas Association of Realtors View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:54:36.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
