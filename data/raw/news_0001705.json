A woman is subdued in the gutter as officers treat a colleague hit by capsicum spray. Picture: Gordon McComiskie   \nWitnesses said the pair had left a taxi without paying near Pyrmont Bridge Road before trying to engage passers-by in conversation, about 3.45am. \nThe pair kept walking away from the taxi, before becoming aggressive in the middle of the street. \n“They came down here screaming, in the middle of the road, waving,” one witness said. \nHe said the pair attempted to hug the man before he rebuffed their advances. Officers with one of the women arrested at the scene. Picture: Gordon McComiskie   A woman is restrained by an oficer at the scene. Picture: Gordon McComiskie   A paramedic treats one of the women.
