Article continues below \nAs mentioned earlier, Florentin plays for French side Saint-Etienne as a left-back. He caused quite a stir at Old Trafford on Thursday when his quick change of direction left Zlatan Ibrahimovic on his backside. \nOther than that though, he exited the game with cramp in the 79th minute. Article continues below EA Sports announce Premier League winter upgrades on FIFA 17 Ultimate Team \nSome English fans may be familiar with his twin, Mathias. \nSeeing as Florentin is a defender and Paul is a midfielder, it would only make sense Mathias operates as a striker to complete the set. \nMathias has played for Wrexham, Crawely and Crewe in the English leagues and currently turns out for Sparta Rotterdam in Holland, a team he scored for on his debut this season. \nHowever, ahead of his brothers' clash at Old Trafford in the Europa League, footage emerged of the third Pogba playing for Wrexham a few years ago. \nBut it's not the kind of highlight reel his youngest brother produces. No, far from it. Instead, it shows Mathias bringing the ball to the edge of the box before hitting nothing but air and falling over. \nIt makes David Dunn's famous clip look decent. \nMathias was in the crowd for the clash between United and Saint-Etienne sporting a half-and-half jersey made up out of the two teams. Although that's normally a crime for football fans, seeing as his mother wore similar attire for the special occasion, we'll let him off. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
