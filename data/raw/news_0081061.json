Slamming it as 'unfunny' and 'dire', the verdict was in on Walliams' opening episode. '@ITV David Walliams #NightlyShow is truly awful, gut wrenching rubbish. Martin Clunes is virtually incoherent, pathetic drivel turned it off,' came the first scathing tweet, slamming not only Walliams but debut guest Martin Clunes. Bring it back! But it would seem ITV have failed to deliver on their promise, leaving viewers raging at the fact that their beloved 10PM news fix has been shunted for a 'turkey' Unhappy customers: Airing at 10PM, the programme - which is supposed to emulate the likes of The Late Late Show or Jimmy Kimmel Live in the States with it's week nightly time slot - has booted the hallmark ITV News At Ten out of its seemingly permanent evening slot 'Gave #nightlyshow 15 mins and it is absolutely rubbish. Script infantile and unfunny, Walliams untalented, Clunes baffled, so switched off!' a second person raged. 'America has the Late Late show we have this!' added a third. A fourth tweeter posted: 'Question for ITV bosses. Was it worth disrupting #NewsAtTen for #NightlyShow? Last time it was Bond films. Didn't work then either,' which was echoed by another who typed: '#itv put my news back where it belongs and don't insult me with the rubbish that is the #NightlyShow!' Referencing drama series Broadchurch, which returned for its third season at 9PM on the same channel, someone else wrote: 'How can you go from the excellence of #Broadchurch to the showing the absolutely dire #NightlyShow?' Raging: Those giving it a go took to Twitter - in some cases a mere 8 minutes into the show - to fume about it 'Gonna build a great high wall round the studio where #nightlyshow is shot. No-one will be allowed out. ITV's gonna pay. Wow! What a turkey!' came another impassioned tweeter. '#NightlyShow F**k me. Can't @ITV go back to showing Prisoner Cell Block H of an evening?' ranted someone else. 'Recorded Broadchurch and, inadvertently, the 1st few minutes of the new #NightlyShow. Grim, sombre & depressing... now to watch Broadchurch,' quipped another viewer. 'I feel like I just watched the end of David Walliams career.... #NightlyShow God DAMN that was awful. I got about 8 minutes in...' concluded another. Slapstick: The team have roped in a 12-strong team of 'comedy' writers to script the show, keeping it fresh and current - yet the first offering failed to reel in many positive comments from Twitter users Trying too hard? In ITV's typical style, the freshman episode saw Walliams perform slapstick sketches - one of which poked fun at Sunday night's Oscar envelope gaffe The big boys at ITV will surely be ruffled by the audience reaction, with guests hosts such as Gordon Ramsay, John Bishop and Mel & Sue lined up to take the reigns in the coming weeks. Convinced that 'young people don't like news bulletins anymore', ITV's director of television Kevin Lygo previously said: 'We wanted to try something new that will effectively extend the prime-time entertainment feel of ITV.' Billed as ' a smart, sharp, fun half hour entertainment show', Katie Taylor, Nightly Show executive producer, has said of the series - which is being trialed on an eight week run - that 'Itâ€™s a great time for satire'. Fail: This skit in particular received social media remarks to the tune of 'really poor, was expecting something to laugh at but even the sycophants are struggling' and 'just awful, awful telly. Who wrote those clunky, obvious jokes? Am-dram, low quality, holiday-camp c**p' Breakout moment: It would seem, therefore, that the producers' hopes for a 'Carpool Karaoke breakout moment' is unlikely any time soon The team have roped in a 12-strong team of 'comedy' writers to script the show, keeping it fresh and current - yet the first offering failed to reel in many positive comments from Twitter users.
