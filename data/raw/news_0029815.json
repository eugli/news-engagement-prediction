Slot to 247Sports Links \nTennis commentator Doug Adler is suing ESPN for wrongful termination, emotional distress, and other damages, according to court documents obtained by Deadspin. ESPN fired Adler over a remark he made about Serena Williams during a January broadcast of an Australian Open match, in which he either described Williams employing either \"the guerilla effect\" or \"the gorilla effect\" to gain an advantage on her opponent. \n\"She puts the Gorilla effect on. Charging\". Just wtf. This is not cool @ESPNTennis @espn pic.twitter.com/L46Bwf6sEh — Shanna (@PinaCocoblog) January 18, 2017 \nAdler later apologized on air, claiming that he was using the word \"guerilla\" as a descriptor of Williams' aggressive tactics, which just happens to be a homophone for an anti-African-American racial slur. \nIn the lawsuit , Adler claims that ESPN agreed with him that there was nothing wrong with using the word \"guerilla\" to describe her playing style but forced him to apologize under the pretense that it would make the issue go away and then fired him anyway. \nThe next day, defendant ESPN forced Plaintiff to go on a live broadcast of another match and apologize for what he said. Plaintiff told defendants that there was nothing wrong with using the word “guerilla” to describe a tennis tactic. ESPN agreed with Plaintiff, told Plaintiff it understood the use of “guerilla” in that context, but wanted Plaintiff to apologize anyways. Defendants told Plaintiff that he needed to apologize on the air and by doing so it would diffused the situation and he could then continue with his broadcasting of the tournament. Reluctantly, Plaintiff made an on-air apology and made it clear he never called Venus a “gorilla” but had meant “guerilla.” \nAfter making the on-air apology, Plaintiff assumed, based on what he had been told by defendants, that he would continue calling the match and the rest of the tournament. Suddenly, however, Plaintiff was told to leave the broadcast booth as soon as he finished making the apology. \nDefendants then fired Plaintiff the next day and told him he was done working tennis at ESPN. \nAdler is a former professional tennis player who had served as a play-by-play person and color commentator for ESPN since 2008.
