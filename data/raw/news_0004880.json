Getting a chance to show your talent in front of some of the best teams in the country every week is something special. \n\"I strongly believe in the way coach Smith runs his program and have faith in all the coaches, so I know I will get better every day. Illinois is a very prestigious school for academics, which is also appealing to me. \n\"There's one college team there and everyone in the town is a fan, which gives you the overall college atmosphere I'm looking for.\" \nDue to the recruiting dead period that takes place during the final days leading up to National Signing Day, DeGroot never had the opportunity to see everything with his own eyes by traveling up to Champaign for an official visit. \n\"It did make me hesitate a little bit at first, but from talking to enough people I know that have been there and know the area well, including the coaches, I trust them when they say it's a wonderful place to be and that I will adapt just fine,\" DeGroot said. \n\"I will be going on a visit up there within the next couple of weeks.\" \nDeGroot, who also heavily considered Boston College , is equipped with additional scholarship offers from Northern Illinois , Connecticut , Florida Atlantic , Southern Mississippi and Cincinnati among others. \nDeGroot checks in with intriguing size in the back end of the defense, and does a nice job of picking up steam and coming downhill with physicality. If you're a receiver, you are certainly aware of DeGroot's presence after completing the catch. \nHe has a reputation for delivering that knockdown blow, but is also a savvy defender that shows good coverage awareness. He can continue to work on his explosiveness and fluidity in his backpedal, but overall, DeGroot is a pad-popping safety with size and toughness. \n\"They can expect someone who's going to put on a show every time he touches the field,\" DeGroot said. \nAs always, stay tuned to Scout.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:22:44.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
