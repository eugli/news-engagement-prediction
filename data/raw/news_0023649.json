She pulled it down and a women aged in her 50s handed her a handwritten note.\n“I thought ‘why is this woman knocking on my window? Is this note a fine or something?’” The mum told Kidspot .\nThe mother received the note will waiting at school pick-up. Source: News Corp. Source: Supplied \nBefore the mum could ask anything, the woman walked off, and the mum opened the note which read:\n“Just a short note to let you know that your air con is very noisy. I do not use mine because it is unhealthy, bad for your lungs & most of all your complexion. Do not feel obliged to turn it down, it is only my opinion about it.”\nThe mum was stunned.\nIt was a hot day, and she rightly thought there was more to worry about than the noise of her airconditioning.\n“By the time I read the note she had walked off in the distance so I yelled out the window ‘I have a sleeping baby in the car, so it’s a no’,” she says.\nThe mum, who preferred to remain unnamed, has no plans to see the woman again, but just in case, she has her “sticky notes ready for the future school pick up”.\nThe mum who received the note is a friend of a Gold Coast blogger named Lauren, who shared the note to Facebook and was equally disgusted by the message.\n“Should babies and toddlers (& children, adults and elderly) be forced to sit in sweltering conditions to avoid such a risk to their precious complexion? Ermmmm let’s weigh up the risks shall we…,” she wrote.\n“On a day like today, when the outside temperature was mid-30s, temps can reach 50 degrees plus in just a matter of minutes in an UN-air-conditioned car. I think that’s more of concern, don’t you?”\nOther Facebook users commented about their similar disbelief.\n“Why is someone worried about a stranger’s complexion? It’s QLD anyway, I personally would have strapped an aircon to my head if I could have while living there. The world has some oddballs out there,” one wrote.\nAnother added, “Yes it would be so much better for your complexion to turn it off and see the internal temperature inside your car rise to 50-60 degrees in minutes! Whatever.”\nLauren said friends of the mum have since told her that she should have told the lady to take her opinion and shove it where the sun don’t shine.\nThis article originally appeared on Kidspot .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:07:00.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
