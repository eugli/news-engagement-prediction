Credit: PA The Conservatives have won the Copeland by-election, claiming a seat Labour had held for decades.\nTrudy Harrison won 13,748 votes, beating Labour's Gillian Troughton into second place, on 11,601.\nThe majority of more than 2,000 votes will be seen as a major humiliation for Labour.\nHarrison, 40, lives in Bootle and has four daughters.\nShe has spent time working with Copeland Borough Council and with Sellafield nuclear power station.\nThroughout her election campaign she pledged to support the nuclear industry in Copeland, including the construction of a multi-billion-pound new nuclear power station at Moorside.\nShe also said she's completely against proposals to change maternity services in west Cumbria, including the downgrading of West Cumberland Hospital from a consultant-led maternity service.\nGillian Troughton arriving at the count. Credit: PA The stunning Tory victory will heap pressure on Jeremy Corbyn over his divisive leadership of the party.\nLabour's majority in the constituency at the general election was just 2,564.\nBut for an opposition to lose a seat to the party of power in a mid-term vote is extremely rare.\nThe last time it happened was the 1982 Merton, Mitcham and Morden by-election, although technically it was a Conservative gain from SDP as the sitting MP had defected from Labour to the SDP before the poll.\nBefore that, the closest comparable case was Sunderland South in 1953.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:20:07.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
