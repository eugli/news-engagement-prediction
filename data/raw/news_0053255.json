It's like a tree trunk.\" Gaye Mullin \nGaye Mullin from Waitara and her Agave Geminiflora which she reckons has grown to about 15ft. \nThe plant is a native of Mexico, but Mullin bought hers from the Ellerslie Garden Show when it was still held in Auckland in 2008. \nREAD MORE: \nShe had no idea what she was in for, but thought the plant's long, thin, flexible leaves would make a pretty addition to her floral art arrangements. Gaye Mullin \nMullin says she doesn't think it's done growing yet. \n\"I just liked the look of it. It's sort of got a bit of rhythm to it.\" \nShe planted it in her half-acre garden on Princess St in Waitara in North Taranaki, and enjoyed using it in her art. \nShe even gave some of it to a floral art friend who had won an award with it, she said. Gaye Mullin \nThe stalk sprung from within this spiky ball of leaves. \nIt did nothing other than that for a few years. \n\"It just sat there. It's quite attractive,\" Mullin said. \nBut three weeks ago, she noticed a stalk had sprung from the middle of the spiky ball of leaves. \n\"I thought it was going to have babies but then it just grew and grew.\" \n\"I've never seen anything like it. \n\"I thought we were going to be taken over.\" \nShe said she had done some research and discovered the succulent was preparing to flower. \n\"It only flowers once in its life, and then I assume it dies.\" \nIt might be a little premature too - they usually flower when they reach maturity 10-15 years after being planted. \nThe Agave Geminiflora is also known as the Twin Flowered Agave and its flowers are tiny, yellow and grow from the stalk in pairs. \nBut Mullin's isn't flowering yet. \n\"It's growing at a rapid rate and I think it's got more to go yet,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:19:44.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
