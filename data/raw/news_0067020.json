It has always been an insider's game,\" he said Wednesday at a debate sponsored by CNN. \"It has been that way for a very, very long time. That is where that lack of trust is coming into play.\" Eight candidates -- former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana; Jaime Harrison, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party; Sally Boynton Brown, executive director of the Idaho Democratic Party; Jehmu Greene, a television analyst, and Peter Peckarsky, a Wisconsin lawyer -- participated in the CNN debate. Candidates spent much of the time sharing their vision for how to move the party forward during President Donald Trump's administration. A frequent claim during the 2016 presidential campaign -- from the left and the right -- was that establishment Democrats had created an environment to ensure Hillary Clinton would win the Democratic presidential nomination. For some, emails hacked from DNC leaders and members of Clinton's campaign furthered that perception. Read More Ronan, a long-shot candidate from Ohio, interrupted Perez to say it appeared as if Clinton, who Perez endorsed, muscled her way into the nomination. \"Because not only was Bernie Sanders snubbed, not only did it look like Hillary Clinton had fought or muscled her way into it, then those supporters were denied a chance to speak at the convention,\" he said. \" And that was the final straw.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:29:42.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
