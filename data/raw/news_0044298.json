The Lakers announced on Tuesday afternoon that Magic Johnson would be taking over as the President of Basketball Operations moving forward , relieving Mitch Kupchak and Jim Buss from their duties. A week ago, Johnson announced he’d like to take over for the Lakers. This week, he got that. So what will it be like with Magic in charge? Going through old tweets is the best way to find out in 2017. 10. He actually liked the Bulls most recent off season moves. What. I'm impressed w/ the Chicago Bulls starting Rondo, Butler, Wade & MCW off the bench they have the 3rd best group of guards in the league... — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) October 31, 2016 9. Magic Johnson is a Dion Waiters fan. Which is fine for anyone that is not a GM of an NBA team. Awesome trade for the Thunder. Dion Waiters can catch and shoot and also create his own shot, just what the Thunder need. — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) January 6, 2015 8. Okay, he LOVES Rondo. The Dallas Mavericks' trade for Rajon Rondo puts them in position to be a contender in the Western Conference. 7. He also likes Jimmer Fredette and Jimmer just scored 73 points in China . Watch out. For all of you out there questioning Jimmer Fredette of BYU, he is the real deal. #MenCare — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) March 20, 2011 6. Thank goodness the Lakers already have a great head coach in place or else Derek Fisher could have been on the way to LA. Great move by Phil Jackson, James Dolan & Steve Mills, hiring Derek Fisher as the new head coach for the New York Knicks! — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) June 10, 2014 5. He watches or at the very least watched First Take. I don’t have anything else to say about this except that I’m sorry. I love the incredible insight and expert analysis you'll always find on @ESPN_FirstTake with Skip, Stephen A. & Cari. Love you guys! — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) April 30, 2014 4. Good news! Carmelo Anthony is going to hang the next banner in LA. Carmelo Anthony is on a mission to win the NBA Championship! — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) April 9, 2013 3. The Lakers future draft picks are in great hands. If Brandon Knight were to come out, I would take him number 1 in the draft. — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) March 27, 2011 2. Magic wants to bring every single NBA star to the Lakers. All of them. Laker Nation: I would love to see Kevin Durant in the Purple & Gold! — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) May 2, 2016 Laker Nation: DeMar DeRozan should be one of the free agents we go after this summer. — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) May 2, 2016 Laker Nation: The Lakers should call LeBron James agent. We know he's going stay in CLE but they should go after him just in case he leaves. — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) May 2, 2016 1. He has the logic you need to be a great GM in the NBA. This is his is all-time best tweet. The only way San Antonio or Miami don't win the championship is if neither team makes the finals. — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) March 7, 2014 Let me be clear that Magic is one of the greatest players of all time, has a fantastic basketball IQ, and is a great business man. There are a lot of great things he can do for the franchise moving forward and we wish nothing but the best for him in doing that. But that doesn’t mean we can’t have a little fun with his tweets. Best of luck, Lakers fans. And Magic, please tweet through it.
