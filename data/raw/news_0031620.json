Some work Saturday morning was slowed down because of light showers, but once the rain cleared, workers were able to move K-rails to the curbs.Workers also cleaned up leftover debris from the road and re-striped it.During the month-long closure, storefront owners said it affected their business and caused traffic nightmares. The closure put pressure on alternative routes, such as Coldwater Canyon Drive.Laurel Canyon reopened around 1:30 p.m. Related Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:27:56.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
