Our first choice didn't disappoint - The Federal Store has great food and coffee, in a very cool environment. \nMuch to my pleasure the rest of our weekend followed suit, as we discovered and indulged in New Plymouth's vast variety of cafes, bars and restaurants. Our weekend took us to dinner at the quirky Social Kitchen, brunches at Monica's and Chaos, a casual dinner at a Southern Indian Restaurant called Kathakali, great coffee at Ozone Coffee Roasters and pre dinner drinks at Frederic's Bar – I recommend them all. \nOne thing that hasn't changed is New Plymouth's spectacular coastal and mountain scenery. Mt Taranaki/Egmont on a clear day delights you by appearing majestically above the sky and can be viewed from various vantage points in and outside the city. Liz Ritchie \nThe stunning Te Rewa Rewa Bridge was built in 2010. \nBeing disappointed on my birthday visit that the mountain was covered in cloud, I was delighted to be presented on departure with the perfect quintessential view of the mountain. Ad Feedback \nNew Plymouth is a surfer's paradise, and the 10km scenic Coastal Walkway has to be the most enjoyable way of exploring these long stretches of beautiful rocky shores. \nThe new Len Lye Centre was another drawcard for me, on our second morning after enjoying brunch at Monica's, we took in the amazing visuals of the reflective exterior of the Govett-Brewster/Len Lye Centre and then inside enjoyed Len Lye's kinetic art and film. One of my highlights was seeing Len Lye's Eiki projector, which would have been purchased from my late grandfather who was the importer of these reputable machines. Liz Ritchie \nThe perfect quintessential view of the mountain. \nNew Plymouth is home to many talented artists of different mediums, but it was the colourful street art that stood out for me – not surprising as New Plymouth was home to the infamous BMD duo. Their bright and quirky works can be found down alleyways and more noticeable parts of the city. \nAnother highlight was the Te Rewa Rewa Bridge. This stunning white bridge built in 2010 is reminiscent to a breaking wave or a whale's skeleton, is 83m long, giving walking or cycling access across the Waiwhakaiho River. On a clear day you get one of the best views of Mt Taranaki/Egmont through the structure of the bridge – unfortunately this wasn't to be on the day we visited, but I was still impressed. \nNo visit to New Plymouth is complete without a visit to Pukekura Park with its array of native and exotic plants, reflective lakes, red bridge and home of WOMAD. Other places of interest we enjoyed were the Puke Ariki Museum, Oakura Beach, Waitara Beach covered in enormous piles of driftwood and where we watched whitebaiter's filling their nets. Further down the coast we sat on a beach resembling a Michael Smither painting. New Plymouth you have certainly done my ancestors proud.
