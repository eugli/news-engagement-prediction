Baig , USA TODAY 9:00 a.m. ET Feb. 10, 2017 Samsung Chromebook Pro CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW YORK—The blurry line between Android and Chromebooks is about to get blurrier. \nExhibit A arrives with the Samsung Chromebook Pro that I’ve been checking out for a couple of weeks. Google calls this upcoming $549 convertible laptop/tablet, and a sibling model, the $440 Chromebook Plus, the first Chromebooks to be “designed for Android apps.” \nGoogle worked closely with Samsung on the machines, which were initially showcased during last month’s CES trade show. \nThese Samsung models come with an embedded pen that you can use, among other purposes, to write or draw directly on the screen, a first for the Chromebook ecosystem. \nThrough “optical character recognition” technology or OCR, your handwritten text becomes searchable, at least if your jottings are reasonably legible. \nThe biggest thing: the machines are integrated with the Google Play Store, which opens up Chromebooks to millions of Android apps. \nIndeed, Google has announced that the Play Store is coming to all 2017 Chromebooks, and it has been made available on models that have already been released, notably the Asus Chromebook Flip, Acer Chromebook R11 and Google’s own Chromebook Pixel dating back to 2015. \nThe addition of Android is another way Google is trying to broaden the appeal of Chromebooks. The machines are popular in education and have made some inroads in business. Google cites an IDC report from last year showing that the Chromebooks overtook Macs as the second most popular PC operating system behind Windows. \nThese cloud-based computers are kept secure through regular software updates from Google. \nIn the past, Chromebooks have been severely hamstrung when you lack Internet connectivity. But there’s now a lot more you can do when you’re offline, whether watching movies, playing games or getting some work done. Android only adds to the offline opportunities. \nWhat's more, as a hybrid machine, the Samsung and Google are invading territory occupied by Microsoft’s Surface machines, among other computers. \nUnfortunately, my experience on the Samsung Chromebook Pro was far from smooth—at least for now. Sometimes the computer froze. Apps were occasionally fickle. \nWith that observation, some key caveats: My test Samsung Pro is a pre-production unit running beta Chrome OS software. \nThe Google Play Store on the Chromebook is still in beta too, a designation that is not expected to be lifted until the Chromebook Pro becomes available in late April. The less expensive Plus model goes on sale this Sunday, so keep your expectations in check on the Play Store experience. \nCuriously enough, the aluminum Pro I was issued is silver colored even though the Pros that go on sale will be black; the Plus models on the other hand are silver. \nThe chief difference between the Plus and the Pro machines, other than price and color, is that the former is outfitted with an ARM mobile processor typically found in tablets and phones, while the Pro works off a laptop-class chipset from Intel. \nOtherwise they’re pretty much the same: very nice 12.3-inch Quad HD touch displays, 4 gigabytes of memory and 32GB of internal storage, microSD slot, two USB-C type ports, a 720p HD camera and a 360-degree hinge that lets you transform these 2.38 pound machines from laptop to tablet or back, or prop up like a tent if say you’re watching a movie. \nThere’s a USB-C charger, and Google is citing 9 hours of battery life for the Pro model but without final hardware and software I couldn’t evaluate that claim. The built-in stereo speakers are ho-hum. \nThe Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus is the first to come with an embedded pen. (Photo: Google) \nThe stylus reminds you of the S Pen on Samsung’s ill-fated Galaxy Note and is similarly tucked away you need it. The moment you pull it out of its slot, a menu appears on the screen with the various options for using the pen. You can use it as a laser pointer, for example, or in a mode that lets you magnifying the screen. You can use it to take a picture of the screen or a portion of the screen. \nI suspect most of you though will use it to draw, write or take notes. I’m no artist but did my best van Gogh impression inside the ArtCanvas app I fetched from the Play Store. My handwritten notes were stored inside the cloud-based Google Keep app, and yes the I had modest success searching for those notes after the fact. Given my lousy penmanship that was quite an accomplishment. \nI was certainly aware that I was writing on glass not paper, but I didn’t detect any latency and the experience seemed natural enough. Google applies machine learning and cloud services to analyze handwriting samples and predict where the pen is likely to go next. The pen itself is pressure sensitive and doesn’t require a battery. \nSamsung Chromebook Pro folded as a tablet (Photo: Google) \nThrough the Play Store I also had a go at apps ranging from games such as Gameloft’s Asphalt 8 Airborne and Deep Silver’s Sacred Legends-- the graphics were impressive. I also downloaded You Tube Kids, Duolingo and Evernote. \nOne snag: for some reason I couldn’t play audio files in Evernote that I was able to play inside Evernote on a Mac. \nSamsung’s Chromebook Pro offers a lot of promise. But it needs the polish that will only presumably arrive when the hardware and software is finalized. \nEmail: ; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter \nThe bottom line", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T16:26:28.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
