That's what the owner will have been thinking. \"They need points on the board quickly and when you see clubs at this time of the season in the position Leicester are in they often make that tough call. \"The thinking will be to get a response from the players.\" Tiatto, who also played for Manchester City during his nine years in England, claims last year's champions had \"drifted into a comfort zone\", during a so- far winless run in 2017. \"Sometimes players don't dig in and work hard when they know they'll be picked each week and there may have been an element of that,\" he added. \"There will be a clean slate when when the new coach comes in and players who haven't been getting picked may get a look in. Where it went wrong for Ranieri at Leicester Nine months ago, Claudio Ranieri was being hailed as a miracle worker and serenaded by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli after guiding Leicester to the Premier League title at preseason odds of 5,000-1. \"You can get a positive reaction from the entire squad. \"Leicester have taken a risk which may well work.\" While understanding Leicester's motivation in terminating the Tinkerman, Tiatto also has empathy for last season's miracle worker. \"They gave him the keys to the city and he is basically a legend of the club,\" he acknowledged. \"We will never see in our lifetime a repeat of what he achieved. \"It's definitely disappointing but Claudio Ranieri is a wise man who has been around the game a long time, and he knows the way the ball rolls. \"It's not the first, and it won't be the last time that manager of his calibre gets sacked. \"The pressure is always on the coach and he's the first To go when the results turn against you. \"There's no sentiment in football ... either towards players or coaches. It's dog eat dog and your head's on the chopping block if you're not performing.\" Tiatto puts Leicester's frantic slide down to losing 'some of their hunger and will to work hard\". \"Maybe they thought they would only need to show up to win games comfortably,\" he added. The loss of midfield mainstay N'Golo Kante to Chelsea was a catalyst of the demise, followed by the failure of Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez to reproduce their scoring exploits. \"I think their work rate also dropped off ... and once that lack of belief crept in they found themselves in a downhill spiral,\" added Tiatto. Mourinho lashes out at 'the new football' after Ranieri sacking Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has shown his support for the now former Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri in a post on social media. \"As much as it's a surprise they won it last year, it's just as big a shock as to how far they have dropped off this season. \"Maybe they need an old school type like an a Sam Allardyce or a Neil Warnock to come in and give them a bit of a reality check.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:11:23.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
