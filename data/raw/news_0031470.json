'This resistance to frontline therapy has occurred over the last decade, has largely gone unnoticed because of the lack of availability of testing and the lack of surveillance,' she said. In January, the NSW-based company SpeeDx received approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration to market the country's first commercial test for MG, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. MYCOPLASMA GENITALIUM MG, or mycoplasma genitalium, is a sexually transmitted infection. In men, MG causes urethritis (infection of the urethra, the urinary canal leading from the bladder to exit at the tip of the penis). Symptoms may include watery discharge from the penis, and a burning sensation in the penis when urinating. In women, MG causes infection of the cervix (opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina). Symptoms are usually absent but may include: abnormal discharge from the vagina, discomfort on urination, and bleeding between periods, often after sex. If untreated, MG can cause pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Symptoms can appear up to 35 days after infection.
