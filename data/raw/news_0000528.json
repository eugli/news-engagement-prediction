I'm not taking part in tomorrow's Trump demo because of the leading role of the SWP in it, a cult which covered up rape. — Owen Jones (@OwenJones84) February 3, 2017 \nBut Mr Jones took to social media on Friday to announce that he was not taking part “because of the leading role of the SWP” which he described as “cult which covered rape.” \nThe SWP, a far-left organisation, has previously been accused of setting up “kangaroo courts” to hear allegations of rape and sexual misconduct against a senior member of the party. \nThe senior party member denied the allegations and the party refuted reports of a cover-up. Thousands to march through London against Donald Trump's travel ban \nMr Jones claims that Stand Up to Racism “is a front for SWP”. \nThe journalist organised last week’s rally against Mr Turmp which saw thousands of Londoners descend on Downing Street in protest against the president’s controversial ban. \nMr Jones has also called for another anti-Trump demo to be held in London on the day MPs are due to debate the US President’s planned state visit. \nThe 'Stop Trump' protest is set to take place in Parliament Square on February 20. Some 16,000 people have already registered their interest in attending.
