During a recent visit to Late Night with Seth Meyers , Mindy Kaling told the host that when the A-list cast of her upcoming movie, Ocean’s 8 joined forces, all eyes were truly on one person. No, not Academy Award winners Anne Hathaway , Cate Blanchett , or Sandra Bullock . It wasn’t TV darling Sarah Paulson , either. The woman of the hour— every hour—was chart-topping sensation Rihanna . Paparazzi would never stick around the Ocean’s set after Rihanna left the scene, Kaling reported. The singer and actress turns 29 on February 20, and her emergence atop the megawatt star power in the cast of Ocean’s 8 is just one example of how she leaves a starstruck wake wherever she goes. Even these fellow boldface names aren’t immune to her presence. Jennifer Lawrence While promoting The Hunger Games: Catching Fire in 2013, Jennifer Lawrence gushed over a memory of meeting the Grammy winner. “She was so beautiful and she had, like, really, really soft skin and . . . smelled really good,” Lawrence said during an interview with BBC 1. Drake Are they dating? Were they dating? Rihanna never tells. Drake, however, is much more public with his displays of affection. “She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself . . . She's someone I’ve been in love with since I was 22 years old,” he announced while presenting the singer with the Video Vanguard Award at the 2016 V.M.A.s. He received an eyeroll from Rihanna, but that didn’t stop Drake from trying to get a kiss as she walked onstage. Justin Bieber In 2009, Justin Bieber told Ellen DeGeneres that he had asked Rihanna, who is more than six years his senior, out on a date. “I just went in . . . I just went in,” a younger and more innocent Bieber said of his approach. “Maybe in a few years.” The Biebs didn’t have to wait long for his crush to return some love. In November of 2010, Rihanna tweeted about his six-pack. \nhttps://twitter.com/rihanna/status/4363663251087361?lang=en Christina Aguilera When paparazzi caught up with Aguilera outside Rihanna’s Diamonds tour concert at the Staples Center in 2013, she brushed past their cameras—until she heard someone mention Rihanna’s name. “I LOVE her,” she said, even turning to the microphone to make her affection known. Sarah Paulson Like Kaling, Sarah Paulson—a longtime Rihanna fan and fellow Ocean’s 8 star— told Seth Meyers that she gets why the world falls at the pop star’s feet. ”There’s a picture in the dictionary next to ‘cool,’ and it’s like, there’s Rihanna. Every time I look at her, I’m like, ‘Work, work, work, work, work,‘” Paulson said, imitating the singer. Prince Harry Harry reportedly said , “Hello, it’s very nice to meet you” when the two met in Barbados in late November. Despite his measured greeting, that smile is pure starstruck. \nhttps://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/804058913960316931 Who can blame these stars, and the rest of Hollywood for that matter, for their adoration? Rihanna is a bonafide star and style icon, whose ability to walk on sidewalk grates in heels and carry wine everywhere she goes makes headlines. She brought a bedazzled flask to the Grammys. There’s a reason she’s on everyone’s radar, from fans to fellow famous folk. 1 / 6 Rihanna in Cuba: The Cover Story Rihanna, parked at Bar la Rosa, on La Rosa Street in Havana, Cuba, with a 1956 Lincoln Continental Mark II (once owned by First Lady Marta Fernández de Batista).
