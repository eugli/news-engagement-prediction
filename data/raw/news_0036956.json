This eucalyptus tree split and fell near the third hole, prompting officials to abandon play for the day \nWorld number six Jordan Spieth also improved by three shots in the 16 holes he managed and was five under alongside second-round clubhouse leader Cameron Percy of Australia. \nScotland's Martin Laird was one of the few to complete his round and a three-under 68 left him inside the top 10 on four under. \nVegas, one of 48 players who had returned early on Friday morning to complete a first round which had been delayed by fog, dropped only one shot in his 14 holes in round two. \nHe said: \"I knew I was going to hit a lot of bad shots so had to find a way to get a lot of up-and-downs.
