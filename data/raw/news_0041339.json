She said Stamford authorities have failed to properly investigate and she won’t remove the slur until they do. \nThe city issued a blight citation, which carries a $100 daily fine. \nNAACP representatives on Monday called for a full investigation, including canvassing the neighborhood and posting a patrol car to make sure the couple is safe. \nAn investigation is underway, the city said.
