AP The Israel Air Force struck targets in Gaza on Monday, according to Palestinian reports. The reports said the strike focused on Hamas positions west of the Nuseirat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip's center. Early on Monday, a rocket fired from Gaza exploded in southern Israel. No one was hurt and no damage was caused as the rocket fell in an open area. At the beginining of the month, a barrage of rockets were fired at the Red Sea resort town of Eilat, but Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system managed to intercept three of them. No Israelis were hurt in the incident, but a number suffered anxiety. Tensions flared up at the time along Israel's border with Gaza after a rocket was fired at southern Israel. Israelâ€™s responded with a series of strikes on Hamas-linked targets . Two members of the security cabinet who spoke with Haaretz hinted last week at the possibility of a more serious escalation within a few months.
