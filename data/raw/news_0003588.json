In his highlight video, Redbirds recruiting coordinator Lamar Conard lays out why the team was interested in him: Welcome to @RedbirdFB : Kobe BuffalomeatLawrence, KS // Lawrence High School — RedbirdHD.tv (@RedbirdHDTV) February 1, 2017 “Big kid. He has some work to do in the weight room, and continue development, but we think he can be a very special player here. You just can’t recruit that kind of size and attitude. He’s more than willing and I think that he will be a tremendous asset to [offensive coordinator Dan Clark’s] offensive line here in the future.” He looks like a great fit for the team. Still, it’s the name that grabbed people’s attention. How does he feel about all this? In an interview with the Chicago Tribune , he revealed he had no idea how famous he’d become (Jordan Peele of Key & Peele gave him a shout-out ), as he was still in class, although someone eventually told him about it. He’d also gotten in contact with a producer from Jimmy Kimmel Live , so expect a TV appearance from him very soon. As for the name, he said he never saw what the big deal was: Tribune: “Do you like having a name that sets you apart?” Buffalomeat: \"Uh, yeah. I never really thought it was that special until today, I guess. It just blew up. But yeah, a lot of people have always talked about my last name, but it's never been this big yet.\" T: “What do you think your parents had in mind, in terms of the ‘Kobe’ part?” B: \"My mom liked Kobe Bryant. He just got in the league when I was born, so she liked it.\" He’s pretty aware of how his name can make people (who are unfamiliar with Native American names) do a double take. Ultimately, he seems to be taking all of this newfound fame in stride. We hope he does well over at Illinois State. You win, God. https://t.co/t4hD2LBB3K — Jordan Peele (@JordanPeele) February 1, 2017 Next Up In ##Lookit", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:27:58.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
