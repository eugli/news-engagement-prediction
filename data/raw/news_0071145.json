VA is planning on declaring over 500,000 Veteran applications for VA health care as incomplete and abandoned at the end of March 2017.\nThese Veterans were placed in a backlog of nearly 900,000 (300,000 are Deceased Veterans) pending applications due to errors with the enrollment system and the lack of a standardized enrollment process (Please see attached OIG Report). Instead of separating these applications by modality and submission, VA leadership has chosen to illegally categorize all the pending applications as incomplete applications due to complainant (Veteran Applicant) failing to complete the application as stated in Title 38 USC section 5102.\nHowever, Mr. President this statute does not apply to 90+ percent of these applications as most are in a pending status due to negligence by the agency. Furthermore the statute requires that VA notify Veterans that they have 365 days to complete the incomplete applications. The email below from VHA Member Services Acting Director Matt Eitutis, that was sent to then VHA Undersecretary Dr. David Shulkin on December 28, 2017 clearly indicates the letters were sent to the wrong recipients. Meaning 440,000 Veterans in a pending means test status were told to provide military service records and 105,000 Veterans in a pending verification status were instructed to provide financial information to complete their applications for VA healthcare.\nAlthough Mr. Eitutis stated he turned the matter over to the Office of the Inspector General to investigate, no such investigation has taken place. Only an internal review by employees who report to Mr. Eitutis was conducted. As a result VA is planning to go ahead with this illegal action of purging these records without providing Veterans notification or disclosing that these Veterans are entitled to Equitable Relief for health care cost they incurred due to administrative errors by the VA.\nIt is for these reasons I have attached a formal request for your office to intervene in this matter.\nPlease feel free to contact me, if your office has any questions about this matter.\nThank you for your commitment to our Nation's Veterans!\nRespectfully:\nScott Davis\nVA Whistleblower\nTop Story 'Santa Trump' starts to deliver for immigration policy hawks   laws.\nBy W.
