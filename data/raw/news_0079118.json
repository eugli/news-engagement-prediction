Inside, it was all ears as the 55-year-old raved about the mum-to-be. “To my wife Amal, there isn’t a day that goes by that I’m not proud to be your husband,” he said. “And I am excited about the years to come, and particularly the months to come. I love you very much.” \nVIEW GALLERY George and Amal at the Cesar Awards \nThe 39-year-old added to his sentiment telling reporters on the carpet in French, “It is a great honour for us to be here. It’s the first time we’re in Paris together so it’s a bit of a romantic weekend for us.” After their evening out, the couple enjoyed all the city had to offer before they become parents of twins in a few months. Amal, who never disappoints with her style, stepped out with George in a back and white ensemble on Saturday. The soon-to-be mom rocked a chic dress and matching coat, while walking close to her husband.
