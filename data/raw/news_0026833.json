Still, Ibaka does present a rare combination of long-range shooting and adequate rim protection, even though his blocks and defensive rating have been declining over the past few seasons, per Basketball Reference. \nBoston still will need to address its interior defense if it hopes to push the Cleveland Cavaliers, who got some bad news Tuesday regarding forward Kevin Love, in the playoffs. \nThumbnail photo via Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T15:41:26.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
