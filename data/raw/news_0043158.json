So we need at least five to six aircraft carriers,\" Yin Zhuo, a senior researcher at the PLA Navy Equipment Research Centre, said. \n\nChinese media has often highlighted the construction of aircraft carriers as the US deployed aircraft carriers in the disputed South China Sea challenging Beijing's claims. \n\nThe US Navy on Sunday announced that an aircraft carrier strike group has begun \"routine operations\" in the South China Sea. The announcement came despite a warning from China not to interfere with Chinese sovereignty in the region. \n\nChina has a long history of maritime disputes with its South China Sea neighbours. It claims almost all of the South China Sea, despite objections from the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam. \n\nChina has also created artificial islands in the area, outfitting some of them with military features.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:44:35.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
