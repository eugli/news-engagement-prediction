"Bank teller caught stuffing hundreds of dollars down her blouse on CCTV DAVID BURROUGHS Last updated 16:14, February 23 2017 KIRK HARGREAVES/THE PRESS \nA bank teller stole money from the bank's cash room, including hiding some down her shirt. \nA bank teller was caught on CCTV stuffing hundreds of dollars down her blouse, a court heard. \nManagers of the ANZ Bank in New Plymouth had become suspicious over missing money and installed a covert camera to find out where it was going. \nThis led to them to staff member Tamsyn Julia Kotze, who admitted stealing more than $4000 from her employers. \nKotze, 29, had worked at the ANZ Bank in New Plymouth between March 2014 and October 2016, including six months of maternity leave which ended in February 2016. \nREAD MORE: * TSB bank issues cyber fraud warning â€‹ \nShe handled cash and balancing, and also had access to the cash room. \nThe police summary of facts said the bank noticed cash discrepancies between March 1 and September 2016 and installed a covert CCTV camera inside the cash room to cover an area the existing cameras couldn't see. \nAfter cash discrepancies were noticed on September 27, 2016, the footage from the camera was reviewed and Kotze was seen taking $320 in notes and hiding them down the front of her blouse. \nWhen police talked to Kotze, she admitted stealing cash from the bank on a regular basis. \nShe said she took it to help make ends meet and while it started off on a fortnightly basis, she soon started taking between $50 and $600 multiple times a week, Ad Feedback \nThe total amount of cash that disappeared was $4,128. \nShe told police she was sorry for letting down the bank and her work colleagues, who she regarded as friends. \nKotze was sentenced in the New Plymouth District Court on Thursday after earlier pleading guilty to theft by a person in a special relationship, which has a maximum sentence of seven years in prison. \nDefence lawyer Josie Mooney said Kotze had approached police as soon as she heard the matter was being handed over to them by the bank, and had helped with their investigation. \nKotze, her husband and their two young children had also moved in with her husband's parents to allow them to pay off debt. \nJudge Garry Barkle asked if Kotze's husband, who was in court to support her, was working during the offending. \n\"He is still working now,\" Mooney said. \n\"It's the debts that they're trying to manage. \n\"They are not paying any rent purely to get by.\" \nShe said Kotze had $4500 in a Kiwisaver account, which she was willing to use to pay back the money she stole, and she had also offered to attend restorative justice with the bank. \n\"She wants to make amends where she can,\" Mooney said. \nBarkle said the exact amount that Kotze took would never be known, and while it wasn't used to support a lavish lifestyle, there would be other people in similar situations who had been able to get by. \n\"You really have to cut your cloth with the amount that you are earning legitimately,\" he said. \n\"It was inevitable you were going to get caught.\" \nBarkle ordered Kotze to pay reparation to the bank at $30 a week and sentenced her to 200 hours' community work. \nHe said Kotze had betrayed the trust of her employers and her offending would have an impact on that in the future. \n", "external_links": [],
