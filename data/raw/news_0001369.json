Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna, Del., on Wednesday. Credit Suchat Pederson/The Wilmington News-Journal, via Associated Press.. SMYRNA, Del. — A corrections worker who was taken hostage by inmates was found dead early Thursday when the authorities stormed a building at a state prison here, ending a daylong standoff. A second corrections worker was found alive when the Delaware State Police “breached” the building at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Facility about 5 a.m., ending the standoff that began when a group of inmates took over the facility about 10:30 a.m. Wednesday. “One of the hostages who is a D.O.C. employee was safely rescued and is being examined at a local hospital,” the Delaware Department of Corrections said in a statement. “The remaining hostage, also a D.O.C. employee, was found unresponsive upon entry. He was pronounced dead at 5:29 a.m.” Gov. John Carney, calling the incident a “tragic reminder” of the risks faced by law-enforcement officials, said those responsible would be held accountable. “Our priority now will be to determine what happened and how this happened,” Mr. Carney said, adding that “we will make whatever changes are necessary to ensure nothing like it ever happens again.” Overnight, state officials said 14 inmates were “released” from Building C where the hostages were held, bringing to 46 the number of inmates who had left the building since the incident began. Two corrections employees were also released on Wednesday. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T16:41:58.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
