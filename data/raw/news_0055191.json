After Mr. Trump’s win in November, United Technologies, which drew Mr. Trump’s ire in early 2016 after its Carrier unit announced plans to shift more than 2,000 factory jobs to Mexico from Indiana, agreed to keep about 800 jobs in Indianapolis that it had targeted for offshoring. But the remainder will move to Mexico. “Did you bring any more of those jobs back?” Mr. Trump asked Mr. Hayes on Thursday. Like United Technologies, many of the industrial firms Mr. Trump would like to see increase hiring in the United States are under intense pressure from Wall Street, especially activist investors and hedge funds, to generate faster earnings growth. That has forced companies like Mr. Hayes’s to embrace cost cuts, and move production from the United States to cheaper locations like Mexico, even though profit margins are high, and United Technologies’ stock has been a strong performer. Shares of United Technologies are up 73 percent over the past decade, ahead of the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 index’s 66 percent gain over the same period. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story At Emerson Electric, represented by chief executive David Farr on Thursday, the work force has shrunk to 103,500 from 131,600 over the past three years. Campbell Soup, whose chief executive, Denise Morrison, sat a few chairs from Mr. Trump in the State Dining Room, has cut employment over the last three years to 16,500 from 20,000, an 18 percent reduction. “Good soup,” Mr. Trump said as she introduced herself, though there was no mention of jobs. The president appeared relaxed and in his element in the room of executives, at one point interrupting to ask Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, to tell a story about watching Mr. Trump make a hole-in-one on the golf course. “I actually said I was the best golfer of all the rich people,” Mr. Trump said. \"Then I got a hole-in-one, so it was sort of cool.” Before the meeting, the executives huddled privately in small groups with cabinet secretaries and senior White House staff members in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building across from the West Wing, trading ideas for job creation initiatives. They complained about ways in which current tax policy and uncertainty about the fate of federal regulations, particularly environmental restrictions, harm their profitability and competitiveness. Those comments came in portions of the meeting witnessed by reporters under ground rules that individual speakers could not be named. Senior administration officials, who also conditioned their comments on anonymity, wondered aloud about how to pay for a massive infrastructure initiative — Mr. Trump has proposed a $1 trillion package — and how to replicate the success of countries like Germany in keeping manufacturing jobs while stepping up the pace of automation. \nNelson D.
