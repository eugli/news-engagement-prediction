Police freed Belkhadir on Monday, and now say he is a witness, not a suspect. \nVery few people, even those with extreme beliefs, ever become violent, explains University of Toronto sociology professor Jooyoung Lee, an expert on gun violence. And almost none ever engage in the large-scale violence of a mass shooting. \n“The vast majority of racist people will not air their racism, or they will practice subtler forms of discrimination and prejudice. Then there’s a smaller handful who are exceptional cases who will act out violently, and an even smaller proportion who will commit lethal violence on the scale of someone like Dylann Roof , or in (Timothy) McVeigh ’s case, have a plot to overthrow the state.” \n“There are not a lot of people who, when the time comes, will become violent. Most people, through socialization, or their psychological development as adults, will not be capable of that kind of premeditated violence on innocent others.” \nThere are almost no North American examples of a mass shooting with more than one gunman. The 2015 San Bernardino attack , in which a husband and wife killed 14 people, and the Columbine high school shootings in 1999, in which two students fatally shot 15 people, are the only North American examples we’ve been able to find. (In this list of 85 U.S. mass shootings going back to the 1980s, 82 had only one gunman.) ‘A despicable act of terror’ ‘No one is completely safe:’ Quebec Premier on mosque shooting ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:01:53.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
