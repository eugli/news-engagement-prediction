Wiltshire to take charge of Swindon Townâ€¦ and life in the Football League shadows has proved to be very gloomy indeed.\nLittle more than a year after leading Aston Villa to Wembley for the FA Cup final and with memories of a sixth-placed Premier League finish with Tottenham fresh in the memory, the 48-year-old was unveiled as the Robins' director of football on November 10 at a modestly-attended press conference in this curious footballing backwater.\nThe gentle ripple of staged applause emanating from a handful of the club's staff at the back of the County Ground suite that day must have immediately alerted him to the reality of his new billing. What's followed has been even more sobering.\nTim Sherwood has been in his new role as director of football at Swindon for three months\nSherwood signs an autograph for a fan outside the County Ground prior to a win over Charlton\nIn his 91 days at the helm, Sherwood has presided over 16 matches in all competitions. Swindon have won three, the first of which came just 48 hours and two training sessions after his appointment.\nThey've been beaten at home by non-League Eastleigh in the FA Cup, been dumped out of the EFL Trophy, again at home, by League Two Luton and in the battle against the drop they're showing as much buoyancy as a stone-laden gilet.\nTheir win rate under their new boss stands at just 19 per cent and, on Sunday, they lost at home to Oxford - a seventh defeat in eight at the hands of their yellow neighbours from 25 miles down the A420.\nSherwood wasn't even at the game. Supporters noticed. This is as fierce a rivalry as exists at League One level and the unexplained absence of the man meant to be leading their team into the fight did not sit well.\nThen again, much of Sherwood's reign has remained unexplained.\nThe Borehamwood boy was appointed after a year out of the game and with his new side - famous for a 1969 League Cup final victory over Arsenal and a one-season cameo in the top flight in the early 1990s - desperately in need of a pick-me-up.\nThe Robins have won three games in three months during his time in charge\nNational League outfit Eastleigh stunned Sherwood's Swindon in his second game in charge\nTIM SHERWOOD'S RECORD AT SWINDON Nov 12: Charlton (h) WON 3-0\nNov 15: Eastleigh (h) LOST 3-1\nNov 19: Rochdale (a) LOST 4-0\nNov 22: Southend (a) DREW 1-1\nNov 26: Bradford (h) WON 1-0\nDec 6: Luton (h) LOST 3-2\nDec 10: Sheffield Utd (a) LOST 4-0\nDec 17: Fleetwood (h) DREW 1-1\nDec 26: Millwall (a) LOST 2-0\nDec 30: MK Dons (a) LOST 3-2\nJan 2: Southend (h) DREW 0-0\nJan 7: Shrewsbury (h) DREW 1-1\nJan 14: Bolton (a) WON 2-1\nJan 21: Peterborough (h) LOST 1-0\nJan 28: Bristol Rovers (a) LOST 1-0\nFeb 5: Oxford Utd (h) LOST 2-1\nOwner Lee Power described Sherwood's arrival as 'one of the biggest appointments the club has ever made' - a bold statement from the chairman of a club that hired Glenn Hoddle, Paolo Di Canio, Lou Macari, Ossie Ardiles, Dennis Wise, Paul Ince and Gus Poyet in coaching roles over the past 30 years.\nSuch was Power's conviction, invitations to the new DoF's formal unveiling were extended to the national media and even the town's local newspaper, the Swindon Advertiser, who for several years have been ostracised by Power with varying degrees of hostility.\nSeemingly happy to bathe in the messianic limelight afforded to him by his new side, Sherwood quickly made it clear that he was in overall charge - picking the team, taking control of the tactics board, leading transfer strategy - meaning Luke Williams, the manager in title who had only signed a five-year contract last March, returned to a supporting role.\n'It's not a demotion,' Sherwood insisted.\nYet Williams, despite not having overall control on the training ground, in the transfer nerve centre or on a matchday, has been left to front up to the media.\nSince his inaugural press conference three months ago, Sherwood has given the impression he is unaccountable - taking training three times a week, allowing Williams to lather him in praise in the Press but routinely skipping the tough questions altogether.\nIncredibly, for the man who in his own words is running the club, he has not spoken to the media before or after any of his 16 games in charge.\nIn response to a Sportsmail interview request, a Swindon spokesman said: 'As you may be aware, Tim has been reluctant to conduct press interviews during his time with us but I will pass this request on'.\nThe 48-year-old has distanced himself from the media during his time in Wiltshire\nSwindon have only won three games out of 16 during his tenure at the County Ground\nIf the football's on, it's on Live tables Fixtures Scores League One Premier League Championship League One League Two Scottish Premiership Scottish Div 1 Scottish Div 2 Scottish Div 3 Ligue 1 Serie A La Liga Bundesliga More tables More fixtures More scores Sherwood did, however, have time to answer questions in a publicity stunt for the video game Football Manager - another event keenly observed by supporters who feel increasingly disconnected from their club.\nAnd it's his aloofness which is driving a wedge between the 6,000-odd regulars at the County Ground and their commander in chief.\nFans' angst and ire were hardly soothed in the January transfer market, either.\nIn November, Sherwood promised experience but the bulk of Swindon's winter-window acquisitions are red raw.\nThree Chelsea youth-teamers arrived in the shape of Charlie Colkett, Islam Feruz and Fankaty Dabo, a fourth player from Stamford Bridge - Dion Conroy - penned a permanent deal, and a contract was handed to former Brighton youngster Jesse Starkey.\nBetween them, they had just 58 professional appearances prior to joining the Robins.\nSwindon did satiate supporters somewhat with the re-signing of Nicky Ajose and Ben Gladwin - both returning for their third stints - while Rohan Ince was borrowed from Brighton.\nBut the fans remained confused. Seven loans, when only five are permitted in an EFL matchday squad? And two, Feruz and Ince, with upcoming court dates?\nSherwood's signings during the January transfer window did not appease the fans\nOxford supporters celebrate their 2-1 derby win at Swindon, which Sherwood missed\nSherwood hasn't made himself available to the Press but appeared on a Football Manager Q&A\nInce is charged with wounding with intent and faces trial on February 13, while Feruz admitted to driving an Â£80,000 Porsche without insurance at Glasgow's Justice of the Peace Court on February 1 and will return for sentencing later this month.\nOf course, Swindon did their due diligence. They were aware of both players' back-stories - indeed, Power even cited their indiscretions as a reason for overloading on loan players - but the club's erratic and disjointed communications policy has left fans scrambling for clarity.\nThe management structure at the County Ground hardly offers anything of the sort - below Sherwood there is head coach Williams, sporting director Seamus Brady and first team coach Ross Embleton. There's also a general manager, Steve Anderson, who runs the administrative side of the club.\nSherwood isn't on a contract, meaning he could walk away without notice at any time. For most clubs that would be a giant risk, especially for one of the 'biggest appointments' they've ever made, but the former Spurs midfielder is close friends with Power.\nHe was best man at the Swindon chairman's wedding, roomed with him as players at Norwich and the pair have set up businesses together. After Power took charge in Wiltshire in 2013, Sherwood lent Swindon many of Tottenham's brightest talents and routinely visited on matchdays to offer his words of wisdom.\nWhat's more, then-Swindon manager Mark Cooper was regularly summoned to Spurs' Enfield training camp for debriefs and many of the players sent down the M4 would do so with the promise of game time.\nPower and Sherwood are close friends, having roomed together as players at Norwich\nAfter the loss to Oxford, Williams told the media that he had assumed total control of team affairs for the game.\nWhen asked where Sherwood had got to, he said: 'I know there is a reason but it would be unfair for me to try and answer that for him.\n'I don't pry and I am sure if Tim was given the chance to speak and tell people why he was not here, he will do.'\nThe Swindon director of football declined Sportsmail's interview request on Wednesday.\nHis appointment at the County Ground was the League One equivalent of mates' rates.\nIt's just this particular friend doesn't seem to have brought many benefits at all.\nThe former Blackburn midfielder takes training and picks the team at the County Ground", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=92172392&iu=/5765/dailymail.uk", "https://pixel.adsafeprotected.com/rfw/st/60025/9852880/skeleton.gif", "https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/ad/N33505.2292307MAILONLINE_UK_DAW/B9964859.134304502;sz=1x1;ord=", "http://i.mol.im/sport/football/footballtable/production/js/footballtable-29.0.0-0.min.js", "https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/306947776;134304502;g", "http://i.mol.im/sport/football/footballtable/production/css/football_at_glance-29.0.0-0.min.css"], "published": "2017-02-09T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:28:14.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
