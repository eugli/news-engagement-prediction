Raz Shechnik | Published: 21.02.17 , 14:57 Despite recently visiting last November , Coldplay's Chris Martin is set to land in Israel again on Thursday, if all goes according to plan. \nFollow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter \n\nMartin visited Israel to scout possible locations for a concert. He stayed for several days, but eventually returned to Britain without a concert deal. \nChris Martin (Photo: Getty Images) \n\nIn the months that followed, rumors abounded that a deal for a concert had been inked, but the band officially denied the rumors about a deal—but not that negotiations were underway. \n\nThe band is interested in performing two shows in the region, one in Israel and the other in the Palestinian Authority as part of a peace tour. However, in similar situations in the past, the Palestinian side has not agreed to \"double\" shows. \n\nFor example, a request by Leonard Cohen to perform in Ramallah was denied following a performance in Israel. \n\nAs such, it is currently unclear how the Palestinians will react or if Coldplay's idea is even feasible in terms of security. The possibility of Coldplay performing for Palestinians in Israel is also being examined. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:28:02.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
