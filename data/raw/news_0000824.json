What you need to know about the President's major changes to US policy on refugees and immigration. \nThe President put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the US and temporarily barred travellers with passports from seven Muslim-majority countries. \nThe orders were met with immediate backlash from the humanitarian community, which labelled them as discriminatory and dangerous for vulnerable refugees. \nJust days ago, former Soviet Union president Mikhail Gorbachev expressed his concerns that the world is preparing for war. \nIn an opinion piece for Time, Mr Gorbachev said the world was \"overwhelmed with problems\" and policymakers seem to be confused and lost. \nABC/AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:36:11.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
