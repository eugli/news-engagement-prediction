My hygiene is the biggest problem and it's starting to get really cold out there. It's getting me down. \n\"The first few days I was trying to put a smile on my face but when I went back in my tent I just cried. \n\"There are some places you can go to get a wash but sometimes I just can't be bothered to get out of the tent because I'm so tired. It has just been a nightmare.\" Nichola Claxton, 42, has been left devastated after sleeping among the headstones in a tent for 11 days ago (Photo: Hull Daily Mail) \nOut of pride, Nichola hasn't told any of her family that she is sleeping rough as she feels like she has failed her four children - including her 11-year-old son who has been taken into foster care. \n\"My kids don't know I'm homeless and my mum doesn't know either,\" said Nichola, who is also a grandmother-of-five. \n\"It should be me looking after them. I feel like I have failed them so I don't want them to know anything. The world can be a cruel place.\" \nNichola, who used to work as a cleaner at a boarding school, thinks that more and more people across the city are being evicted because they can't afford their rent.

Nichola, said living outside in the freezing cold is a \"nightmare\" and she hasn't been able to tell her family as she feels ashamed (Photo: Hull Daily Mail) \n\"I do get money coming in but it's hard to eat on the streets,\" she said. \n\"We've got a little stove for cups of tea and soup but that's it. If I hadn't been able to eat at these soup kitchens I would have looked worse by now so I am one of the lucky ones.\" \nNichola has since been in contact with Humbercare to try and find a place for her and her boyfriend to live in. \nShe has urged other people across the city who are sleeping rough to get help as soon as possible as she warned that homelessness can affect anybody. \n\"It could be anybody at any time. It doesn't matter if you are a drinker, drug addict or a working person, it can happen to anybody,\" she said. \n\"If you are homeless get in touch with people who run homeless organisations instead of staying out on the streets and letting no one help you out.\" Read More \nDave Richmond, city neighbourhoods and housing manager at Hull City Council, said: \"There was an eviction that took place in respect of her partner but only after that case had been in court three times over the last 18 months. \n\"By the time of the eviction, the debt stood at over £2,000. \n\"We are not aware that they have approached us for help and assistance. If they did we could maybe signpost them somewhere else. \n\"If they had paid some of this off we would have carried on with that agreement at Great Thornton Street. \n\"But if someone is not engaging with us and the debt is rising week after week we can't carry on.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:39:11.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
