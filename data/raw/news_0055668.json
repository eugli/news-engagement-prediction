Renshaw retired hurt after the fall of the first wicket and it was later confirmed that he had an upset stomach. ( Scorecard ) \nFast bowler Umesh Yadav provided India with the first breakthrough, cleaning up Warner (38) which brought captain Steve Smith to the crease. Renshaw, who was batting on 36 at the time, tried to use this opportunity to take a loo break which took everybody by surprise. ( Bizarre scenes as Matt Renshaw leaves batting crease with upset stomach ) \nSmith was bemused and lost. Renshaw had batted brilliantly up until that point, using his feet smartly against the spin of Ashwin, Jayant and Ravindra Jadeja . ( Pune Test, Day 1: Starc defies India after Umesh grabs 4/32 ) \nBut the 20-year-old left the field and Shaun Marsh, who was due to bat next, had to rush on to the field to take strike. All this happened just 15 minutes before the lunch break. ( What a cacth! Wriddhiman Saha flies to pull off a stunner ) \nFormer Australia captains Allan Border and Michael Clarke were the first ones to voice their opinions against Renshaw's actions followed by a few other cricketers as well. \n\"I hope he's lying on the table in there half dead,\" Border said on Fox Sports. \"Otherwise, as captain, I would not be happy. ( India vs Australia, 1st Test, Day 1: As it happened ) \n\"I don't think I've ever seen that before. He's obviously just got an upset stomach to some degree and he was probably trying to use the situation where David Warner had just been dismissed to race off the ground and go to the toilet. ( Dry pitch for Pune Test could play into Australia's hands: Shane Warne ) \n\"What happened in the ensuring time there, I can't ever think of a situation like that that's happened before where someone's gone off because they're a bit ill. \n\"If David Warner hadn't got out then he wouldn't have even thought about it. It's a bit of an odd situation. He probably thought he had time to race off the ground and get back on while the new batsman was coming out to the crease. \n\"I can tell you what, if Shaun Marsh was dismissed in those last 15 minutes I would've been ropeable as captain.\" \nMichael Clarke, who was on air for Star Sports commentary duties, was left stunned with the development minutes before lunch. \n\"What is going on here? He's retiring ill,\" former Test skipper Michael Clarke said on Star Sports commentary after watching the unusual situation unfold. \"There's only 15 minutes to lunch. I can't believe Renshaw's retiring. He must be extremely sick with a stomach bug and has to go to the bathroom. \n\"This is unbelievable for Australia. \"Steve Smith didn't know what was going on. He walked onto the field after the dismissal of David Warner and his partner walked straight past him.\" \nRenshaw returned only after the fall of the third Australian wicket of Peter Handscomb (22) and went on to slam his second half-century as Australia reached 256 for 9 at stumps on Day 1. Renshaw top-scored for the visitors with 68 while Mitchell Starc remained unbeaten on 56. Umesh was the pick of the bowlers for India as he grabbed 4 for 32, while Ashwin and Jadeja both took two wickets each. Still don't know why he didn't leave his bat and gloves there and just go to the toilet a la KP did at the SCG??
