The first group was five individuals; the second group was 16, for a total of 21 people who were arrested for illegally crossing the border,” officers said in a statement. \nWATCH: At least 21 asylum seekers crossed into Manitoba early Saturday: RCMP \nRita Chahal, with Welcome Place, welcomed the refugees Saturday after they had finished processing with Canada Border Services Agency in Emerson, Manitoba. \nImmigration lawyer Lorne Wildman said the refugees can be charged under the immigration refugee protection act for entering Canada illegally. \n“But, they will have right to refugee claims heard in Canada, which they wouldn’t have crossing at land border crossings,” Wildman added. \nHe said that’s because of the safe third country agreement, wherein if a person crosses from the U.S. into Canada and makes a claim for refugee status at a land border crossing, they are told they can’t claim it because they already have the status in the U.S. in most cases. \nRELATED: Law students in Manitoba join Canadian students to come up with a way to help refugees \n“But, if they cross illegally in to Canada somewhere other than border crossing and then meet with immigration officers in Canada, then third party agreement does not apply to them,” Wildman said. \nThe federal government responded to the influx of asylum seekers jumping across the border illegally, saying not everyone is eligible to seek asylum in Canada. \nOfficials told Global News that people convicted of serious criminal offences and those who have had previous refugee claims denied by Canada are not eligible to make a claim. \nNour Ali and Maysoun Darweesh moved to Winnipeg just over four years ago as Syrian refugees — they were sponsored and went about it the legal way. However, the couple said they do understand the dire situation some refugees are facing. \n“A lot of cases they have no choice. They have [a] feeling they are not safe there. They are feeling one day they will kick them out from U.S.,” Nour Ali said. \nWhile this weekend only saw one big group of asylum seekers make the overnight trek to Emerson from the US, the Reeve of Emerson said he doesn’t think this will be the last group of refugees he’ll be seeing. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
