Azzanni has worked for the Volunteers since 2013 and prior to that spent one season as the wide receivers coach at Wisconsin. \nThe search for a wide receivers coach got started late because Curtis Johnson did not inform the Bears he was leaving until after the staff worked the Senior Bowl at the end of January. Johnson’s one-year contract expired and he departed to take a job with the Saints . \nAzzanni will be the Bears’ third receivers coach in three seasons and takes over a position group with question marks as Alshon Jeffery will become an unrestricted free agent March 9 provided the Bears do not place the franchise tag on him before the 3 p.m. March 1 deadline or sign him to an extension. The Bears could also parts ways with veteran receiver Eddie Royal, who is due to make $5 million this season. \nAzzanni is the third new position coach on offense as Jeremiah Washburn (offensive line) and Curtis Modkins (running backs) have already been hired. \nAzzanni played wide receiver at Central Michigan from 1994 to 1998 before beginning his coaching career at Valparaiso in 1999. He worked at Bowling Green, Central Michigan, Florida and Western Kentucky before landing at Wisconsin in 2012. \nA look at the faces at Halas Hall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:30:26.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
