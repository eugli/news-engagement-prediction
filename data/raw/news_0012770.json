And he was cool, calm and collected. By Mandy Antoniacci Mandy Antoniacci is a sports business analyst, entrepreneur, and columnist.

As the creator of ChangeUp, Antoniacci builds companies and writes stories that help \"progress the game.\"   \nAfter watching Tom Brady and the New England Patriots pull off the most improbable comeback in sports history, I think we can all agree on a few things : \nSuper Bowl LI is the greatest comeback win in the greatest Super Bowl ever played. \nTom Brady is   in NFL history. \nTom Brady 's mental aptitud e is perhaps better than any professional athlete. \nLeading up to the Patriot's historic moment in Houston, Brady has been crediting the team's mental toughness as the defining factor. \n\"We've won a lot of different ways under a lot of different circumstances. This mental toughness, man, that's what it's all about, and this team's got it,\" he said on the on-field stage. \nDisplaying his personal muses, Brady highlights a notable passage from a classic bestseller in his newly created Instagram account, surprisingly, about tennis. W. Timothy Gallwey's, The Inner Game of Tennis: The Classic Side To The Mental Guide Of Peak Performance , was a phenomenon when initially published in 1972, mainly for its revolutionary work in overcoming the self-doubt, nervousness, and lapses of concentration that can keep a player from winning. \n\"It concentrated on the fact that, as Gallwey wrote, \"Every game is composed of two parts, an outer game, and an inner game.\" The former is played against opponents, and is filled with lots of contradictory advice; the latter is played not against, but within the mind of the player, and its principal obstacles are self-doubt and anxiety.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T13:34:58.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
