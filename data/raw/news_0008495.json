Instead, he says his own experience shows that older people can continue to work, exercise and enjoy life to the full, and he backs this up with a mixture of scientific research and his own story. This is a message everyone — including politicians — should listen to. There are some 10 million people over the age of 65 in the UK, including 3 million over 80. They consume three-quarters of the NHS budget. Charles’s running achievements are in the 95-plus age category, a field in which, you imagine, he doesn’t have too many competitors. Charles, a retired dentist, had one sport — rowing — that he began as a schoolboy in London and carried into adulthood, but eventually dropped, so that, by the time he was 50, he’d become what he describes as ‘a balding, self-satisfied lump of lard’. Then, at the age of 63, when most people are giving things up, he decided to get in shape and took up rowing again. As he approached his 70s, he began rowing in age-categorised competitions, continuing into his 80s. But, by the age of 87, he became concerned by his deteriorating performance. Too much of his muscle had converted into flab. This process, known as sarcopenia, begins in middle age. By 60, you can expect to lose 15 per cent of your muscle mass. Charles set out to reverse the process. He joined a gym and told his personal trainer: ‘I want a beach-ready body.’ Charles is adamant there’s nothing special about him and that it’s nothing to do with his genes Instead of laughing, the trainer took up the challenge and gradually Charles lost the flab and replaced it with muscle. He argues that anyone can achieve this, citing a 2005 American study of nursing home residents who undertook 14 weeks of strength training. On average, they shed 3 lb of fat and gained 4 lb of lean muscle. Leg strength improved by 80 per cent, upper body 40 per cent and joint flexibility 30 per cent. The cost of their care was reduced by $40,000 annually. When he was 95, Charles was forced to give up rowing because he’d developed an irregular heartbeat. So he decided to take up running, and, within two years, he became world champion for his age. He can do the 200m sprint in 55.48 seconds. To put that in perspective, most 80-year-olds lead a chair-bound existence, exercise for only five or six minutes a day and are completely sedentary for a bum-numbing nine hours. Charles cites the wealth of scientific evidence showing regular exercise prolongs longevity and helps prevent a raft of illnesses, including heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes. He eats a healthy diet, comprising plenty of fruit and vegetables and lentils and beans, which has, no doubt, contributed to his healthy old age. Charles Eugster poses for a portrait alongside members of the Thames Rowing Club He eats a healthy diet, comprising plenty of fruit and vegetables and lentils and beans, which has, no doubt, contributed to his healthy old age. But there’s another factor which he believes has a catastrophic effect on ageing: retirement. He says 65 was fixed as the retirement age a century ago when that was the average life expectancy. You stopped work and, pretty soon, you died. Pre-retirement people who are unemployed suffer more from chronic disease and mental illness than people in work. After retiring from dentistry because of his decreasing manual dexterity, Charles started a dentistry newsletter, which achieved global success and was extremely profitable. Latterly, he’s had a job representing an international healthcare company encouraging older people to join gyms, adopting a new role as a public speaker at the age of 93. Now, at 97, he’s become an author and is making a fair fist of that, too Now, at 97, he’s become an author and is making a fair fist of that, too. His book includes plenty of practical advice on how anyone in a reasonable state of health can begin to improve their body well into old age. There are detailed instructions for exercises to improve strength and flexibility. More importantly, though, this is an inspirational book for anyone who approaches ageing with dread. ‘Man has destroyed the joy and wonder of ageing by transforming it into a line of relentless deterioration and disease,’ he says. ‘But age is just a measure of how long we’ve been on this Earth. There’s a big difference between the number of candles on a birthday cake and how we actually feel.’ Charles’s TEDx Talk ( http://blog.ted.com/this-93-year-old-has-a-message-for-us-a-beach-body-at-90-is-no-longer-a-dream/ ) has been downloaded more than half-a-million times. So it’s possible he could find himself up against some serious competition out on the track some time soon . . .
