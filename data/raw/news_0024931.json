Working class voters gave him an overall approval rating of -40. Upper and middle class voters gave the Labour leader the same score. In the 18-24 age group 34 per cent had a favourable opinion of Mr Corbyn but 35 per cent had an unfavourable view. Corbyn accused the BBC of peddling 'fake news' in a bad-tempered interview yesterday The next age group - 25-49 - the number of voters who gave a negative response was double the number giving a positive rating. His approval ratings are even worse among the older age groups. Just 21 per cent of voters aged 50-64 viewed him positively and 67 per cent gave a negative rating, while among pensioner-aged voters just 13 per cent view him favourably. Much of Mr Corbyn's support comes from within London, but the poll shows that just 26 per cent of voters in the capital view him favourably, while 63 per cent view him in an unfavourable light. Yesterday Mr Corbyn showed signs of strain as he lashed out at the BBC and accused it of 'fake news' when he was asked whether he had told his inner circle he had named a date to step down as Labour leader. In a car-crash interview, the veteran left-winger bizarrely insisted the party was 'united' despite 52 MPs defying his orders to vote against the historic legislation last night. Jeremy Corbyn, left, promoted Rebecca Long-Bailey, right, to shadow business secretary to replace Clive Lewis, who resigned to vote against the Government's bill to trigger Britain's EU divorce Struggling to control his temper, Mr Corbyn denied that the dramatic decision by shadow business secretary Clive Lewis to resign rather than vote in favour of triggering Article 50 was a 'disaster'. Last night Mr Corbyn began filling the vacancies left by senior frontbenchers who quit to vote against the Government's Brexit bill. The Labour leader promoted Rebecca Long-Bailey to shadow business secretary to replace his close ally Clive Lewis, who resigned to vote against the Government's bill to trigger Britain's EU divorce. Peter Dowd replaced Ms Long-Bailey's former Cabinet role as shadow chief secretary, while Sue Hayman joins Mr Corbyn's top team as shadow environment secretary following the resignation of Rachael Maskell. And Jo Stevens, who quit last week to defy the Labour party whip on the Brexit bill, is replaced as shadow Wales Secretary by Christina Rees. But Mr Corbyn has yet to find a replacement for Dawn Butler, the shadow cabinet minister for diverse communities. THE RUNNERS AND RIDERS TO TAKE OVER IF CORBYN DOES GO Norwich MP Clive Lewis A formerly staunch Corbyn supporter, he fell out with the leadership over the party's stance on Trident. As shadow defence secretary Mr Lewis was said to have punched a wall after a conference speech playing down the idea of unilateral disarmament was altered as he walked on stage. Mr Lewis will have burnished his credentials with the largely pro-EU grassroots by resigning to vote against the Brexit Bill last night. But he has been an MP for less than two years, has a fairly marginal constituency in Norwich South, and some MPs fear he is too volatile for the top job. Rebecca Long-Bailey The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury is being lined up by allies of shadow chancellor John McDonnell as their preferred option if Mr Corbyn either decides to walk away or is forced out. Mr McDonnell, who is so unpopular with colleagues that he probably would not get enough nominations to run himself, has described her as the 'next generation of our socialist leadership team'. But she is relatively unknown and may be seen as having too little experience if it does come to a contest in the near future. Angela Rayner The shadow education secretary has impressed with some strong performances in the Commons, and is often deployed to television studios by the leadership. She has an eye-catching back story, having left school at 16, become a teenage mother, and then built a successful career. She would be a plausible candidate for Labour's increasingly radical left-wing activists. She also has a solid union powerbase, having worked for Unison. Sir Keir Starmer The shadow Brexit secretary is a former director of public prosecutions and the intellectual heavyweight of Corbyn's shadow cabinet. He is forensic in the House, where he has been credited with forcing the government into concessions on the EU departure process despite Labour being in a hugely conflicted position. In a less polarised political atmosphere he could be the favourite, but the current anti-establishment mood and hard-left party membership is likely to mean he is the right man at the wrong time. Lisa Nandy A rising star of the soft left who has been in parliament since 2010, many thought the Wigan MP was being groomed by Team Corbyn for an eventual succession. But Ms Nandy became disillusioned with the shambolic leadership, and resigned along with swathes of other frontbenchers in a bid to force Mr Corbyn out. She then served as co-chair of the abortive challenge by Owen Smith. Since Mr Corbyn was reelected by another big margin she has refused to come back into the fold, and instead focused her energies campaigning on issues such as the government's troubled independent child sex abuse inquiry.
