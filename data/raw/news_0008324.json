Priebus called Scaramucci to tell him he should pull out of consideration to be director of the Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs, a post held by Valerie Jarrett under President Barack Obama, according to a source familiar with the situation.\nStory Continued Below\nScaramucci, a top fundraiser and campaign surrogate who recently sold his hedge fund to move into the administration, has said publicly he’s still waiting for the Office of Governmental Ethics (OGE) to clear his appointment.\nPriebus told him Trump couldn’t wait to fill the job until Scaramucci’s ethics review was complete, a process that could take up to 90 days. Do the right thing, the White House chief of staff told Scaramucci, according to the source.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in an interview that Scaramucci was never officially offered a position, though transition officials had previously confirmed the job to multiple reporters. “It wasn’t announced,” Spicer said when reached by phone on Tuesday afternoon. “I never said that he had a job.”\nWithin minutes of that conversation, Priebus was on the phone to Scaramucci again to tell him that he was back in, according to the source. Priebus explained the White House would hold the position for Scaramucci until he’s cleared by OGE, though someone might take the job temporarily.\nAnother person familiar with the situation said in a text: “Reince is not stopping Scaramucci. OGE is.”\nThe episode signaled a new round of infighting within Trump’s inner circle of loyalists as they struggle to adjust to their new roles, a larger staff and the pressure of running the government.\nPriebus has pushed in the past against offering a White House appointment to Scaramucci, who has the ear of Trump, his adviser Stephen Bannon, Trump’s children and Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.\nCongress\nSenate Democrats go party of no against Trump By Elana Schor\n“Reince is trying to cut someone who has a direct line to Trump,” said a person close to Trump. “This is where Reince wants to throw down the marker, but he will lose this one.”\nSpicer followed up later Tuesday, saying \"as of the last hour\" Scaramucci was still slated to be a part of the administration.\n\"He's not out, all they're doing is going through the OGE,\" Spicer said. \"Until you're clear, you're not official. He's filled out the forms, the Office Government of Ethics has to review it. He completed a major deal. It's on par with these [Cabinet] nominees.\"\nWhen asked if Priebus told Scaramucci to back away from the job this afternoon, Spicer said \"I've not been told that it's true.\"\nPriebus did not respond to a request for comment.\nTrump has been quick to name appointments, ambassadors and cabinet posts before vetting is complete. Intensive background checks generally take about three months to review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:20:34.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
