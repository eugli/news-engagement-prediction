Deadline reports that Paramount Pictures will begin production for \"Action Park\" in March. The park was open from 1978 to 1996 at what is now the Mountain Creek Ski Resort in Vernon. The park was infamous for dangerous rides and lack of supervision, prompting the nickname Traction Park. Six people died at the park, which included three drownings in the Wave Pool. The park's name was revived by Mountain Creek in 2014, but more injuries followed, and the name did not return for the summer of 2016. Knoxville, known for his roles in \"Jackass\" and \"Bad Grandpa\" said the film will be an \"80s-type comedy\" in the spirit of his previous films.
