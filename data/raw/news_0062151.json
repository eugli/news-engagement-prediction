The chic figureheads were captured yesterday practically twinning in similar shades of pale pink as they walked the grounds of Spain’s Royal Palace on the first day of Awada’s four-day trip to the country with her husband, President Mauricio Macri. Something of a fashion spread come to life, the diplomatic visit for the Argentinian First Family was most certainly off to a picturesque start. And with a visit today to the opening of Spain’s contemporary art fair, ARCO, the two women once again seemed united by their refined tastes, showing off two very polished—but distinct—looks. Sheathed in a red, white, and blue silk pussy-bow shirtdress, Awada breezed through the exhibits under the heels of round-toe Mary Janes. Cool and unstudied, with her hair pulled back into a slightly tousled ponytail, the First Lady and fashion entrepreneur looked like an in-the-know patron of the arts. Beside her, Queen Letizia was zipped up into a minimalist white sculptural dress that flared ever so slightly. Playing with contours and shapes, the piece seemed to be a nod to the installations that surrounded them. The Spanish royal’s python pumps brought a bit of texture and edge to her neutral look. Chatting away with artists and even making some crafts with kids, the two ladies may have taken a different approach to the gallery-hopping attire, but it was clear they both have an eye for detail.
