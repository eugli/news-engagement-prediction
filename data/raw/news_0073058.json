Marijuana doesn’t address her underlying disease, but it does relieve her painful symptoms.\nNationwide, an estimated 1.4 million patients in 28 states and the District of Columbia use legal medical marijuana for a varying list of conditions. A much smaller number of patients in 16 states use limited extracts of the plant, primarily to treat seizure disorders.\nIn the midst of an opioid crisis, some medical practitioners and researchers say they think that greater use of marijuana for pain relief could result in fewer people using the highly addictive prescription painkillers that led to the epidemic.\nA 2016 study by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that states with medical marijuana laws had 25 percent fewer opioid overdose deaths than states that do not have medical marijuana laws. And another study published in Health Affairs last year found that prescriptions for opioid painkillers such as OxyContin, Vicodin and Percocet paid for by Medicare dropped substantially in states that adopted medical marijuana laws .\nIn December, the New York Health Department said it would start allowing some patients with certain types of chronic pain to use marijuana as long as they have tried other therapies. The state’s original medical marijuana law, along with those in Connecticut, Illinois, New Hampshire and New Jersey, did not include chronic pain as an allowable condition for marijuana use, in part over concerns that such a broad category of symptoms could result in widespread and potentially inappropriate use of the controversial medicine.\nAdvocates for greater use of medical marijuana argue that including chronic pain as an allowable condition could result in even further reductions in dangerous opioid use.\nBut some physicians remain cautious about recommending the botanical medicine as a pain management tool.\nJane Ballantyne, a pain ­specialist at the University of Washington and president of Physicians for Responsible ­Opioid Prescribing, which promotes the use of alternatives to opioids for chronic pain, said she does not recommend that her patients try marijuana.\n“There is no doubt marijuana is much safer than opiates. So we don’t discourage its use.” But in general, she said, “non-drug treatments are far more helpful than any drug treatment, and marijuana is a drug.”\nAt Mount Sinai Hospital here in New York, Houman Danesh, director of integrative pain ­management, suggests patients try physical therapy, yoga, ­acupuncture, stem cell therapy, nutrition counseling, hypnosis and behavioral health counseling before resorting to opioids or any other medications. He said a lack of sufficient research to back up marijuana’s safety and efficacy has kept him from adding it to his pain management tool kit, but he doesn’t rule it out in the near future.\n[ Latest recommendations for treating back pain ]\nIn January, the National ­Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a ­review of more than 10,700 medical marijuana studies published since 1999, showing that substantial evidence supports the use of marijuana or its extracts for the treatment of chronic pain. Existing research also supports its effectiveness in treating multiple-sclerosis-related muscle spasms and chemotherapy-induced ­nausea and vomiting, according to the literature review. But the study cautioned that both the positive and negative health ­effects of marijuana need to be studied further.\n[ Doctors prescribed me pain meds but couldn’t help me get off them ]\nHistorically, research on marijuana has been hamstrung by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which classifies marijuana along with heroin and LSD as illegal substances with “no currently accepted medical use” and “a high potential for abuse.” As a result, the supply of legal marijuana that can be studied and federal funds to pursue academic research are limited.\nSince 1996, when California voters ushered in the first law legalizing medical marijuana, the progression of states adopting similar laws has been slow and steady. Enacted in 2014, New York’s medical marijuana law is considered among the most cautious in the nation. Americans for Safe Access, a patient advocacy group, gives the state a letter grade of C when it comes to balancing product safety and ease of access to the emerging medicine , among other criteria.\nNew York allows doctors to certify patients to purchase marijuana at a limited number of highly regulated dispensaries — 20 statewide, including four in New York City — for the treatment of 10 conditions: cancer, HIV infection or AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord damage, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel ­disease, neuropathies and ­Huntington’s disease.\nIn the fall, after two years of operation, the state health agency declared its medical marijuana program a success and expanded its rules to allow nurse practitioners to certify patients for marijuana use. The state also approved home delivery for patients too ill to travel and announced it would certify more manufacturers of marijuana extracts to increase the supply of tinctures, liquid capsules, sprays and vape cartridges available for patients who rely on them.\nRemarkable results Sabulski’s physician, Howard Shapiro, started certifying patients for marijuana about a year ago and quickly became a believer. He’s one of only 371 doctors out of nearly 33,000 in the city’s five boroughs registered to certify patients for medical marijuana. Statewide, only 863 out of about 96,000 physicians have signed up for the program.\nTechnically, doctors can’t prescribe marijuana for their patients because federal law prohibits it. But under New York and most other state laws, doctors can verify that patients are suffering from an allowable condition, which authorizes patients to purchase marijuana on their own at a regulated dispensary. So far, Medicaid, Medicare and most private insurance do not cover medical marijuana, so patients must pay out of pocket.\n“I really think medical marijuana is the drug of the future,” Shapiro said. “We’re going to find out that it does a lot of things we already think it can do but don’t have scientific studies to prove it.”\nOut of 109 patients he’s seen over the past year, all but a handful reported substantial improvement in their pain and other symptoms within a month or two of using medical marijuana, he said.\nFor Shapiro’s patients, the cost of marijuana treatment ranges from $300 to $400 a month, depending on their level of use. Sabulski said her monthly bill is about $400.\n“I urge my patients to purchase only a two-week supply at first, so they don’t waste money on a dose that may not be effective,” Shapiro said. Most patients start out with a 1-to-1 ratio of THC, the intoxicating component of marijuana, to CBD, the second major component, which has proved to be medically effective for a range of conditions.\nPatients typically need to work with the dispensary to adjust their ratio so that the medication alleviates their symptoms but doesn’t get them too high to function, Shapiro explained. It’s a trial-and-error process, he said.\n[ Medical marijuana without the high ]\nMost marijuana patients take a tincture or liquid capsule every four to six hours during the day and use a vape pen to inhale a faster-acting dose of marijuana extract when they have breakthrough symptoms. Sabulski said she uses a vape pen before she gets out of bed in the morning, because it almost instantly wards off her abdominal spasms. She then takes an oral dose, which kicks in within one to two hours.\nLast resort At 36, when she quit her job last year, Sabulski said she feared she would be permanently ­disabled and never be able to return to work. She had seen multiple specialists and tried a medicine cabinet full of prescribed drugs, including ­OxyContin and muscle relaxers, to relieve her pain and abdominal spasms, but nothing worked.\nOnce she was unemployed, Sabulski said, she experimented on her own with street-purchased marijuana and found that it worked better than anything else she had tried. But she couldn’t control the potency of what she was smoking, so sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn’t, and sometimes it made her too high to function.\nStill, she felt well enough to return to work and started applying for jobs. That’s when she realized she couldn’t pass a drug test, which she said most employers she spoke to required.\nIn December, Sabulski found Shapiro through a Yelp listing and brought him her medical files so that he could consider certifying her to use pharmaceutical-grade marijuana. Working with him and a pharmacist at a dispensary in Queens, she said she found the perfect combination of THC and CBD to keep her symptoms at bay while allowing her to be highly functional.\n“It’s been life-changing,” she said.\n— Stateline\nRead more:\n[ Drug industry hired dozens of officials from the DEA as the agency tried to curb opioid abuse ]", "external_links": ["https://www.health.ny.gov/regulations/medical_marijuana/", "http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/35/7/1230.abstract", "http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/02/20/515675259/got-back-pain-try-yoga-or-massage-before-reaching-for-the-pills", "https://www.mpp.org/issues/medical-marijuana/state-by-state-medical-marijuana-laws/medical-marijuana-patient-numbers/", "https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2016/2016-12-01_chronic_pain_condition_added.htm", "http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2017/Cannabis-Health-Effects/Cannabis-conclusions.pdf", "http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2016/03/03/states-cdc-seek-limits-on-painkiller-prescribing", "http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/med/medcounts.htm", "https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2016/2016-11-22_medical_marijuana_program_expansion.htm", "http://www.safeaccessnow.org/medical_marijuana_access_in_the_usa", "http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2014/state-medical-marijuana-laws-linked-to-lower-prescription-overdose-deaths.html", "http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2017/02/21/can-marijuana-ease-the-opioid-epidemic"], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:31:14.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
