After unzipping the archive, users get a binary file whose name ends in the \"Patcher\" string. Files infected with Patcher ransomware (Source: ESET) \nThis detail is very important because it may be a clue that users can utilize to spot new Patcher-infected torrents in the future, which the ESET team hasn't yet picked up. \nAs for Patcher itself, ESET researchers say this ransomware is very poorly coded. \nThe first sign that users are dealing with a useless file, potentially malware-infected, is when they execute the crack file, which launches a window with no background. Crack tool infected with Patcher ransomware (Source: ESET) \nIf users close this window and launch the crack tool again, the window won't show up anymore. Patcher doesn't send the encryption key to its author \nClicking the \"Start\" button starts the encryption process. According to ESET researchers , Patcher generates a 25-character-long random number that it uses as the encryption key to lock user files. \nThe bad news is that Patcher doesn't send this encryption key to an online server, so the person/group behind the ransomware has no way of decrypting your files. \nEven worse, the encryption key is long enough to make recovery impossible via a brute-force attack that tries to guess the key. \nOther signs that Patcher is an amateurish attempt at Mac ransomware are spread all over the ransomware's encryption process, which contains various errors. Patcher encryption process \nThe actual encryption process begins when users press the Start button in the image above, and with the generation of the encryption key via the arc4random_uniform function. \nPatcher will take the user's files, one by one, and lock them in a password-protected archive, where the password is the previously generated encryption key. \nThe same encryption key is used for all files, which is considered bad practice among ransomware operators, who generally prefer layered encryption models, which are harder to crack. \nPatcher will search and encrypt files in the user's /Users directory and in all mounted external and network storage drives found under /Volumes . \nThe ransomware also adds the .crypt extension at the end of all encrypted files. A file named image.png will become image.png.crypt. \nOnce the encryption process ends, Patcher drops the following ransom note, named README!.txt , in all the user's directories. NOT YOUR LANGUAGE? USE https://translate.google.com What happened to your files ? All of your files were protected by a strong encryption method. What do I do ? So , there are two ways you can choose: wait for a miracle or start obtaining BITCOIN NOW! , and restore YOUR DATA the easy way If You have really valuable DATA, you better NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, because there is NO other way to get your files, except make a PAYMENT FOLLOW THESE STEPS: 1) learn how to buy bitcoin https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_Bitcoins_(the_newbie_version) 2)send 0.25 BTC to 1EZrvz1kL7SqfemkH3P1VMtomYZbfhznkb 3)send your btc address and your ip (you can get your ip here https://www.whatismyip.com) via mail to rihofoj@mailinator.com 4)leave your computer on and connected to the internet for the next 24 hours after payment, your files will be unlocked. (If you can not wait 24 hours make a payment of 0.45 BTC your files will be unlocked in max 10 minutes) KEEP IN MIND THAT YOUR DECRYPTION KEY WILL NOT BE STORED ON MY SERVER FOR MORE THAN 1 WEEK SINCE YOUR FILE GET CRYPTED,THEN THERE WON'T BE ANY METHOD TO RECOVER YOUR FILES, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! \nAfter this, Patcher changes the last modified date of all encrypted files to February 13, 2010, for no apparent reason, with the touch command. \nAt this point, Patcher attempts to load the diskutil app to safely erase free space on the root partition. Patcher's poor coding shows up again, because an error prevents the ransomware from executing this operation, as the author has mistyped the diskutil path in macOS. Patcher uses one Bitcoin address and a Mailinator account \nTwo other signs that Patcher was an insufficiently planned out project comes from the fact that the ransomware's author has used the same Bitcoin address to take payments for all users. \nWhen users pay (which is not recommended), the author asks users to send him an email to a public Mailinator inbox, which everyone can access. \nAll of these are signs that the Patcher author has no experience with ransomware operations, as pranksters could delete emails from this public inbox. \nIn the past, Mac users have been targeted by other ransomware families, such as KillDisk and KeRanger , both much better coded and with a lot more attention to detail when compared to Patcher. \n\"This new crypto-ransomware, designed specifically for macOS, is surely not a masterpiece,\" says ESET's Marc-Etienne M.Léveillé. \"Unfortunately, it’s still effective enough to prevent the victims accessing their own files and could cause serious damage.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:35:25.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
