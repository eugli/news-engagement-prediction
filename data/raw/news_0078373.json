To make matters worse, while they were up on stage Ryan Gosling had to explain jazz to them.\" A look at the #Oscars backstage scene the moment 'La La Land' mistakenly won Best Picture. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/gjhqdwAQd8 — The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) February 28, 2017 \nJimmy Kimmel, host of the Oscars, explained what happened during Monday's episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! \n\"What Warren did is he was confused so he handed it to Faye and let her read the winner,\" said Kimmel. \"In other words, Clyde threw Bonnie under the bus. It was a slick move.\" \n\"People around me said, 'oh did you pull a prank of some kind,'\" Kimmel added. \"If I had pulled a prank I wouldn’t just have the wrong winner’s name on the envelope. when they opened it there would be like a Bed Bath and Beyond coupon at the end of it.\" \nConan O'Brien defended Beatty, saying that the envelope he was given \"was pretty confusing.\" \nThe host showed a \"clip\" of what happened, with a close-up of the envelope, which read, \" Moonlight is not the film that didn't win best picture.\" \n\"MoonlightLaLaLand?\" \nOn The Daily Show , Trevor Noah joined \"everyone everywhere still trying to figure out what in the living f— happened at the Oscars.\" \nRoy Wood Jr. joined him at the desk, explaining \"peak blackness,\" which is a \"rare metaphysical anomaly,\" he said, happening lately as several black actors were nominated for Oscars, Beyonce announced she was pregnant and \"Frederick Douglass came back to life.\" \n\"All of this blackness culminated at the Oscars,\" he concluded of the Moonlight win. Trevor and Roy Wood Jr. discuss the Oscars and how America has reached “peak blackness.” https://t.co/9AxEKTZNXr", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:05:24.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
