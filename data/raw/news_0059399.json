Lee/Staff photo) Dallas wants feds to declare Trinity River 'unnavigable' so City Hall can keep its $4 million mistake Filed under Commentary   \nUsed to be -- since, oh, about forever -- you could go both ways on the Trinity River. You could go upstream, and you could go downstream. Because, well, nature. And the federal government said so. \nBut now comes the city of Dallas, which is asking the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to pretty-please consider rewriting the laws of God and men to make the Trinity a one-way ride -- downstream and nothing but till the end of time. All because the city royally screwed up the river in 2011 and doesn't want to pay for its sins. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pressed Dallas for Trinity Wave fix for weeks without council knowing \nIt's right there in a lengthy letter the city attorney sent to the Corps earlier this month, in which Larry Casto very nicely but very sternly asks the feds to \"remove upstream navigability requirements\" on the Trinity River. The letter went to the Dallas City Council Friday night, in advance of a Wednesday meeting that'll take place behind closed doors. \nAll this has to do with the so-called Dallas Wave, the phony whitewater feature that opened beneath the Santa Fe Trestle in May 2011 and was promptly shut down after the Corps determined that the thing was treacherous -- not the whitewater part, mind you, but the bypasses that were supposed to keep casual boaters out of the splash zone. As it turned out, the water-churning chutes meant for safe passage were mighty dangerous. \nWorse, the city had clogged up what used to be a beautiful stretch of river flowing into the forest, and in doing so, had violated the very permit it received for the project . \nCasto's letter is just one among hundreds exchanged between the Corps and city over this failed project over many years. It's also the most transparent, a last-ditch effort to save the city millions -- the very thing that doomed this idea from the start. \nAt this point, no one disagrees that the $4-million whitewater feature in the Trinity River known as the Dallas Wave is a mistake -- I mean, that's what Mayor Mike Rawlings and former city manager A.C. Gonzalez called it. Like, they actually used that very word: \"mistake.\" Gonzalez said it in January of last year ; Rawlings echoed that sentiment in February 2016 when talking to the Dallas City Council . A mistake. Gonzalez went so far as to tell this newspaper last year that the thing never should have been built. \nBut it was because his predecessor, Mary Suhm, and a few of the wealthy donors funneling private dollars into the Trinity corridor really wanted it. In 2011 the Trinity Commons Foundation touted its impending opening -- \"You'll be able to navigate a whitewater course on one segment of the river,\" right -- as another giant step toward \"Fulfilling the Potential of the Trinity River.\" \nExcept this project was paid for with $4 million in public dollar bills. Six years later, it's money the city might as well have set on fire. \nWorse, according to Casto's letter to the Corps, it will cost between $2 million to $8 million to repair or remove the excrescence. Corps tells City Hall to decide quickly whether to repair or remove Dallas Wave in Trinity River \nSo ... $12 million, maybe, when all's said and done? No wonder Casto's going long. It's fourth and forever. And time's run out; money, too, in a city that postponed a bond election and might steal some pennies from DART to bail out the fast-failing police and fire pension fund. \n\"I don't want to spend any more on it,\" said Lee Kleinman, who chairs the council's Trinity Corridor Project committee. \"There are so many needs in this city.\" \nThere was a time when the whitewater feature was supposed to be inexpensive -- $445,800 total, if I read my November 2005 briefing right, and I'd like to think I do. The council was told that was one of its so-called benefits: \"Inexpensive to construct with no maintenance or operating costs.\" \nAn early rendering of what we did NOT get when Dallas sunk the \"Standing Wave\" in the Trinity. \nBut between then and 2011, the costs kept escalating -- from half a mil to $1 million to $3 million to just past the $5 million mark, not including the $76,000 or so in studies done shortly afterward to find out just how dangerous it really was. To fight the rising costs, the city decided to cut corners by value engineering the thing -- not my words, but the city's, found in the February 2016 briefing explaining how this thing got so jacked up. \nIn the end, the city decided to replace poured concrete with a gabion structure. Which is one reason among many it doesn't resemble the natural-looking attractions in Reno, Nevada, and Vail, Colorado, displayed in the 2005 briefing. We were shown watercolors with bright blue water and round boulders; what we got was a toilet-water flume ride. \nOne fabrication among many. And not even the worst. Dallas rows a mighty slow boat when it comes to removing its $4 million mistake in the Trinity River \nWay back in July 2009, Dallas City Hall promised the Corps that the Dallas Wave was \"designed for non-motorized boats (i.e., canoes, kayaks, and small personal fishing boats) and small motorized boats (i.e., small, personal fishing boats) which typically frequent this river section.\" And it vowed that \"the boater bypass feature would allow for both upstream and downstream passage of boats and aquatic life.\" \nAnother lie. Boaters could only go downstream; so, too, the aquatic life. \nAnd that's a violation of the permit, not to mention more than a century's worth of Corps directives and federal laws that say the Trinity's supposed to be navigable between Fort Worth and Houston and you can't obstruct navigable waterways. \nCasto's letter, which provides a brief but thorough history of the Trinity, insists those laws are outdated, written at a time when it was hoped the Trinity would serve as a commercial waterway connecting North Texas to the Gulf of Mexico. All that \"remains and will forever remain just a dream,\" Casto writes, insisting, it would seem, that navigability, too, is but a faded fantasy. \nWhich will likely not sit well with the Corps, which Casto said Friday night has yet to respond to his missive. \nAnd it's not going to sit well with some on the council: North Oak Cliff's Scott Griggs called the ask \"mind-boggling, reckless and irresponsible,\" echoing the very thing he said last year, when it was revealed in private correspondence that a city employee has suggested asking Congress to \"change the law and have the navigability requirement for the Trinity river between here and Ft. Worth be removed.\" Rawlings says Dallas Wave in Trinity River was a 'mistake,' but council won't kill it yet \nThat's the very thing Casto's asking for. \n\"It doesn't make sense,\" Griggs said. \"And it didn't make sense to put rapids in the middle of the Trinity River.\" \nFor years the Corps told the city to do something; and for years the city did nothing. Around this time last year, the feds gave the city an ultimatum: Remove or repair the Dallas Wave, or risk lawsuits and losing past and future Trinity River-related permits. And still nothing. Just the desperate hope that the Corps will go with the flow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:01:49.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
