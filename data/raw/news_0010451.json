On Thursday (Feb. 2), the songwriter paired up with rising indie girl group Bolbbalgan4 and released the collaborative single “Lost Without You.” \nMad Clown’s high-toned, storytelling raps and the crisp, resonant singing of Bolbbalgan4’s Ahn Ji Young blend sweetly together on the midtempo song. But despite its spritely melody, “Lost Without You,” or “I Can’t Find My Home” as it’s known in Korean, tells a melancholic story of love and regret after the end of a relationship. \nAlthough her vocals aren’t featured on the track, Bolbbalgan4’s other half Woo Ji Yoon -- who typically raps on the duo’s songs -- partook in the creation of the song and worked alongside Mad Clown and Ahn to guide the song’s direction. The trio appear together in the song’s music video, which features black-and-white footage of their songwriting and recording experience. \nBolbbalgan4 are relative newcomers to the Korean music scene, but they had multiple hits in South Korea last year, including “Galaxy” and “Tell Me You Love Me.\" \nMad Clown’s a more established act and one known for his collaborations ever since his 2013 duet with SISTAR’s Soyou “Stupid In Love” reached No. 1 on the now-defunct K-Pop Hot 100 chart. His addition to the soundtrack of the Korean television show Descendants of the Sun was one of the most popular songs in Korea in 2016. \nWatch Mad Clown and Bolbbalgan4 create “Lost Without You\" here:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:38:51.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
