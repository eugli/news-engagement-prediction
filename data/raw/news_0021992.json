Video: Streets in the Great Southern town of Wagin were flooded due to heavy rain. (ABC News) \nThe worst-affected areas are expected to be south of Hyden and Narrogin, down the south coast including Lake Grace, Lake King, Ravensthorpe, Jerramungup and surrounding areas. \nHeavy rainfall overnight hit the area, with the Bureau of Meteorology's gauge at Dragon Rocks recording 53 millimetres between midnight and 3:00am. \nResidents are being told to avoid travel if possible, and stay out of the rivers and ocean. \nPeople are also being asked not to drive through flooded areas as the true depth of floodwaters is not always clear. Northam flooding threat eases \nThe Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) issued a warning yesterday saying people in and around Northam should prepare to evacuate. \nBut district officer Sven Anderson said the river may be close to peaking at Northam and at Toodyay, if it had not already done so, and was not expected to rise further. \n\"Things are pretty much as expected, or better, which is very good news for us and obviously, for the community,\" he said. \n\"Currently things are going really well and it's staying under a level where it's causing any damage. \n\"Obviously that can change, it won't change quickly but it can certainly change.\" \nHe said river levels were likely peaking this morning in Beverley, and downstream later today York, Northam and Toodyay were expected to follow suit. \nHe said there was still potential danger as water flowed downstream, but rain levels were not expected to be too dramatic. \n\"The rain expected over the weekend has actually lessened, so we're only expecting up to 5 millimetres today and not that much more on Sunday so that probably won't affect the levels very much,\" he said. \nThere is also a flood warning current for the West Kimberley district, and a flood watch for the Pilbara, in the north of the state. \nPerth received 15mm since 9:00am yesterday. \nSwanbourne received 36.4mm in the same period. \nConditions in the city are expected to ease today, with just 0-1mm of rain predicted to fall, and a top of 26C.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:57:50.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
