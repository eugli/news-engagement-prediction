Get what you need today in this early-morning email. A man knelt on the asphalt, writing on a sign in blue marker: “Follow the rubles.”\nBehind him in the crowd, others held signs saying: “Putin’s puppet,” “Flynn is the tip of the iceberg,” and “The Constitution is NOT a suggestion.”\nThe rally was organized by Hartranft and other local groups, including Indivisible Metrowest. The group is a local chapter of Indivisible , a national movement that offers “a practical guide for resisting the Trump agenda” in which “former congressional staffers reveal best practices for making Congress listen,” according to its website.\nAdvertisement\nShouts of “Russophobia!” by a person nearby the rally interrupted a speaker from Indivisible Metrowest, to which attendees responded with chants of “U.S.A.!”\nNoel Sanders, 22, who handed out falafel and baked goods during the protest to raise money for left-leaning nonprofits, attended the rally to represent the “far left” despite the “nationalism” and “Russophobia” that she and two others with her said some of the speakers expressed.\nProtesters compared Trump unfavorably to other world leaders.\nKeith Bedford/Globe staff\nKit (left) and Beth Corcoran of Amesbury said the Pledge of Allegiance during the protest.\n“Trump is becoming like Chairman Mao [Zedong], so we are worried,” said Sue Lai, 48, a Chinese immigrant.\nLai said her young son approached her after the election of President Trump and asked, “Am I safe?”\n“I regret that I didn’t do more before the election to keep [Trump] from winning,” Lai said, fighting back tears.\nSpeakers talked about disparity between the Republican party they had respected and Trump’s new brand of conservative populism.\n‘[Trump is] using his power to scare people so they don’t ask the tough questions.’\n“I was born into a world where we called our political leaders ‘Democrats’ and “Republicans’ because they believed in the principles of democracy and the foundations of our republic,” said Medha Parnati, a 16-year-old junior at Westford Academy, member of the LGBTQ community, and child of Indian immigrants.\nBut, Parnati said, “America has become complacent. . . . Now we watch as Putin’s [undemocratic] tendencies are adopted by our own leader.”\nJacquelyn “Jackie” Ryan, a member of Massachusetts’ Democratic State Committee who identified herself as the first openly transgender elected official in the state, said she respects Republicans, including Jeb Bush, John Kasich, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham.\n“But it’s clear Trump is no ordinary Republican,” Ryan said. “He’s using his power to scare people so they don’t ask the tough questions.”\nSpeakers and attendees also took issue with Governor Charlie Baker, who was scheduled to visit the White House and meet with Trump and the First Lady Sunday evening.\nThe Republican governor didn’t support Trump’s campaign and has publicly disagreed with the president on issues including the immigration order, but he also hasn’t attended major anti-Trump rallies in Boston — a fact that led protesters to break out into chants of, “Where’s Charlie Baker?”\n“I think his absence has been duly noted,” Hartranft said.\n“He knows what to say and when to say it, but that’s all we’re going to get from Governor Baker, unfortunately — words,” Ryan said.\nNicole Fleming can be reached at nicole.fleming@globe.com .
