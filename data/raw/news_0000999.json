Trump asked Musk to serve on his Strategic & Policy Forum and a manufacturing council.\nOver the weekend, Musk voiced concern with Trump's executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, and asked his Twitter (TWTR) followers to read the order and offer suggestions on amendments that could be made .\nMusk\nResponses ranged from the supportive to the critical.\ndan\ntweet3\nMusk is advising Trump now, but he has said disapproving things about the president in the past. Before the election, Musk had said in an interview with CNBC that he thought Trump was \"not the right guy,\" for the presidency, and that Trump \"doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.\"\nMeanwhile, it is unclear how many customers have cancelled Model 3 reservations, which require a refundable $1,000 down payment.\nTesla has about a year-long backlog of pre-orders for the car, which will be Tesla's first mid-priced all-electric sedan. Musk has said the company will begin volume production of the car later this year.\nSo far, there is no evidence Musk's involvement is having any big impact on Tesla's bottom line.\nTesla was not immediately available for comment.\nÂ© Provided by CNBC Read the full story on Electrek Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://electrek.co/2017/01/31/tesla-model-3-reservation-holders-canceling-orders-elon-musks-trump/", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmjCXf?blobrefkey=101&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;180&quot;}", "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/04/donald-trumps-character-reflects-poorly-on-united-states-says-elon-musk.html?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=104252232|It", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmjCXf%3focid%3dst&text=Musk+and+Trump%27s+budding+bromance+is+capturing+Wall+Street%27s+attention&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmjCXf%3focid%3dst", "http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/27/elon-musk-has-trumps-ear-and-wall-street-takes-note.html?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=104252232|It", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmjCXf%3focid%3dsl&title=Musk+and+Trump%27s+budding+bromance+is+capturing+Wall+Street%27s+attention&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmjCXf%3focid%3dsl", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmjCXf&lang=en-us&flow_id=95111296-f35d-43a4-bd0d-07c6b8b52041", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "https://twitter.com/colinniloc81/status/826196109303361538?ref_src=twsrc^tfw", "http://vapi.cnbc.com/videoservice/rssvideosearch.do?partnerId=8020&quot;}", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmjCXf?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA3e1oO.img", "http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/30/elon-musk-polls-twitter-for-a-way-to-improve-trumps-travel-ban.html?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=104252232|It", "http://cnbc.com/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6Dp75.img", "https://twitter.com/danmoran3/status/825812525652520961", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmjCXf?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;102&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmjCXf?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/", "http://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=104252232|It", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmjAH3.img&quot;}}", "https://twitter.com/tomcoates/status/825818388714774528", "http://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=104252232|It", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502618680045568", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/68f52e16-d470-4068-b92c-51ced65efbf3/eaffa908-6917-468d-b60c-fdc598c25b47.ism&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1006&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/68f52e16-d470-4068-b92c-51ced65efbf3/eaffa908-6917-468d-b60c-fdc598c25b47.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;htt"], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:04:07.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
