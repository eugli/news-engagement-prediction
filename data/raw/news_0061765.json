Children diagnosed with SEN can be granted 25 per cent extra time in their exams – an extra 30 minutes in a two-hour paper – and supervised rest breaks, known as access arrangements. Earlier this month, independent schools were accused of ‘gaming the system’ after it emerged one in five privately educated students claimed extra time in GCSEs and A-levels last summer – significantly higher than the one in eight pupils who received additional time at state schools. Mrs Petersen added: ‘The system is so academic, it’s so focused on getting results, focused on getting through SATs and GCSEs, that everyone wants to do the best they possibly can. For a parent, if that means they can get a diagnosis to get access arrangements, then that’s what they’ll do. ‘But, unfortunately, there are lots of children who haven’t got parents who are able to do that who miss out. It then becomes a bit of a postcode lottery in who’s getting diagnoses.’ According to the research, almost three-quarters (72 per cent) of teachers believed some families wanted their child to be labelled as having a learning difficulty ‘even though there was little evidence to support that belief’. When quizzed for the reasons, 64 per cent claimed it was due to wanting ‘a medical or psychological explanation’ for their child’s difficulties. As a result, three-fifths of teachers (62 per cent) said ‘those with genuine needs are missing out because resources are being diverted to children that don’t really need help’. Some poorer families are also trying to gain additional benefits by claiming their child needs support for ADHD and autism, according to the research.
