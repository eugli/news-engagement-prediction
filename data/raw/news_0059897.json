February 23, 2017 4:14 PM by Patricia Garcia Sonia Recchia At this month’s Santa Barbara International Film Festival, Ryan Gosling, who is up for a Best Actor Academy Award for his role in La La Land, was asked whether he planned on bringing Eva Mendes, the mother of his two children, as his date to the upcoming Oscars ceremony. “Oh, I’m not sure,” he replied. “It’s still a little while away.” A Gosling and Mendes joint appearance on the red carpet would instantly go down as a major Oscars event. There have been many memorable ones in the past: Remember sinewy Anjelica Huston arm in arm with Jack Nicholson in 1975? Nicole Kidman looking regal in Dior in 1997 next to her then-husband, Tom Cruise? Michelle Williams and Heath Ledger, young and in love and on the rise? And Brangelina, of course, so many years of Brangelina. While Gosling and Mendes have all the makings to join the ranks of these Hollywood power couples—they’re both talented A-listers and global objects of desire—throughout their six-year relationship, they’ve remained one of the most private couples in showbiz history. Aside from posing side-by-side while first promoting The Place Beyond the Pines, the 2012 movie where they met and fell in love, the two have yet to officially step out as a couple. In fact, save for a few paparazzi photos, there is barely any photographic evidence that they’re even together. Of course, there are plenty of other celebrity couples who choose to skip the red carpet , but these two don’t just avoid a photo op, they’re also determined to keep their private life private. While most celebrities have taken to revealing their pregnancies in increasingly dramatic fashion , most of the world didn’t even know Mendes was pregnant until after their first daughter, Esmeralda Amada, was born in 2014. “Early on, we decided it’s going to be so hard for her to have privacy,” Mendes said to Ellen DeGeneres during an appearance on her show . “This is the first opportunity we can give her, to protect her, and so that I had a nice, calm pregnancy, which I did.” The couple pulled off the same feat last year after their second, Amada Lee, was born last April. At this year’s Golden Globe Awards, Gosling again attended sans date, but in a surprise move, he made sure to thank his partner during a heartfelt acceptance speech . “While I was singing, dancing, playing piano, and having one of the best experiences I’ve ever had on a film, my lady was raising our daughter, pregnant with our second, and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer,” he said. “If she hadn’t taken all that on so I could have this experience, it would surely be someone else up here today.” Viewers around the world collectively swooned. So while the odds are Gosling will show up to the Oscars solo once again, perhaps it’s for the best. After all, those previously mentioned couples? They’ve all split since then—quite messily and publicly, in fact. And Gosling has already proven there are other ways of expressing devotion beyond the step and repeat.
