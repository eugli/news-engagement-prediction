It is very sad, for she truly didn't deserve to die the way she did,\" he told reporters during the funeral procession.\n\"She was a very religious woman and often helped the Thai temple. I have known her husband for more than five years and he is also a very soft-spoken man, so it is hard for me to believe that he could have offended somebody that much to cause this,\" he said.\nTan said the family was baffled as to why this happened to her and hoped police would be able to find out the truth and seek justice for what happened.\nRuby Lee was shot dead in the 5.45pm incident when she was driving her BMW car alone and was approached by two men riding a motorcycle who then fired more than 10 shots at her.\nShe was shot from the driver's side with six shots hitting her chest. - Bernama", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:35:22.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
