Many of the protesters left peacefully, but police made some arrests two hours after the deadline.\nEarlier in the day, some of the last remnants of the camp went up in flames when occupants set fire to makeshift wooden housing as part of a leaving ceremony.\nAuthorities later said about 20 fires were set and two people — a 7-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl — were taken to a Bismarck hospital to be treated for burns. Their conditions weren’t given.\nAfter the deadline passed, as many as 75 people outside the camp started taunting officers, who brought five large vans to the scene. Police took about 10 people into custody for failing to heed commands to leave, authorities said.\nA man who did not want to be identified loads a teepee canvas on his car as he leaves the Dakota Access pipeline opponents’ main protest camp Wednesday. | James MacPherson/Associated Press\nWith darkness falling, Lt. Tom Iverson said police would not enter the camp Wednesday evening, and he offered no timetable for doing so.\nLevi Bachmeier, an adviser to Gov. Doug Burgum, said about 50 people remained in the camp at dusk.\nHours before, about 150 people marched arm-in-arm out of the soggy camp, singing and playing drums as they walked down a highway. It was not clear where they were headed. One man carried an American flag hung upside-down.\nAuthorities sent buses to take protesters to Bismarck, where they were offered fresh clothing, bus fares home and food and hotel vouchers.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers set the deadline, citing the threat of spring flooding.\nAt the height of the protests, the site known as Oceti Sakowin hosted thousands of people, though its population dwindled to just a couple of hundred as the pipeline battle moved into the courts.\nThe camp is on federal land in North Dakota between the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and the pipeline route that is being finished by Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners. When complete, the project will carry oil through the Dakotas and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois.\nSome of the protesters were focused on moving off federal land and away from the flood plain into other camps, said Phyllis Young, one of the camp leaders.\n“The camps will continue,” she said. “Freedom is in our DNA, and we have no choice but to continue the struggle.”\nCampers set structures on fire in preparation for leaving the Oceti Sakowin protest camp Wednesday in North Dakota.

We have to leave our second home,” he said.\nLaw enforcement officers and first-responders were on hand from several states.\nCharles Whalen, 50, an alcohol and drug counselor from Mille Lacs, Minnesota, said he and a group of about 20 people were not going to leave on their own and were willing to get arrested to prove their point.\n“Passive resistance,” Whalen said. “We are not going to do anything negative. It’s about prayer.”\nA fire burns in the background as opponents of the Dakota Access pipeline leave their main protest camp Wednesday. | James MacPherson/Associated Press\nSome campers said they were leaving with mixed feelings, both energized by the long protest and saddened to leave new friends. Some people set off fireworks.\nMatthew Bishop, of Ketchikan, Alaska, has been in North Dakota since October. He planned to move to another camp.\n“People have been surviving here for hundreds and hundreds of years … so if I back down, what would I look like?” Bishop said as he tied his possessions to the top of his car.\nCraig Stevens, spokesman for the MAIN Coalition of agriculture, business and labor interests, said the group understands “the passions that individuals on all sides of the pipeline discussion feel” and hopes that protesters’ voices “will continue to be heard through other peaceful channels and in court.”\nA massive effort to clean up the camp has been underway for weeks, first by protesters themselves and now with help from the Army Corps in removing debris.\nSome vehicles and pedestrians were having trouble getting through the muck created by recent rain and snow, and cleanup efforts were suspended in part because camp officials did not want heavy equipment making conditions worse.\nPreviously from Chicago News", "external_links": ["https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp3.jpg?w=900&h=600", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp4.jpg?w=400&#038;h=300", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp2.jpg?w=150&h=107", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp4.jpg?w=400&h=300", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp2.jpg?w=840&h=600", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp2.jpg", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp3.jpg?w=1024", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp3.jpg?w=450&#038;h=300", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp3.jpg?w=150&h=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp4.jpg?w=768&h=576", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp4.jpg", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp4.jpg?w=1024", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp2.jpg?w=768&h=548", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp4.jpg?w=800&h=600", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp3.jpg?w=450&h=300", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp3.jpg?w=768&h=512", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp2.jpg?w=420&h=300", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp2.jpg?w=420&#038;h=300", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp2.jpg?w=1024", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp4.jpg?w=150&h=112", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dakotacamp3.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-22T16:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:12:00.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
