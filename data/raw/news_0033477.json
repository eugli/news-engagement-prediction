Picture courtesy: YouTube \nIndian television and film actor Sidharth Shukla, who is currently making his presence felt in the new relationship drama Dil Se Dil Tak has an advice for anyone who is dying to be in a relationship. Being single is smarter than being in a wrong relationship...! â€” Sidharth Shukla (@sidharth_shukla) February 12, 2017 The good-looking actor recently took to social media site Twitter to express his feelings about relationships in general. He wrote, \"Being single is smarter than being in a wrong relationship!\"\nWow! Now that is a great advice, but it looks like the actor doesn't really get the hype surrounding Valentine's Day, and that is completely okay. Now, he didn't say exactly that, but the aforementioned tweet and another thing that he posted on Twitter point in 'that' direction. \nNot too long ago, the talented actor had tweeted, \"Can't freaking understand, if the heart does not have any bones, how the hell does it break?\" Can't freaking understand... if the heart does not have any bones... how the hell does it break !! â€” Sidharth Shukla (@sidharth_shukla) February 7, 2017 To catch the actor at his romantic best, watch Dil Se Dil Tak at 10:30 pm every Mon-Fri on Colors TV.
