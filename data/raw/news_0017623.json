Credit: RSPCA/PA \nFive chickens were found without food or water and stuffed in a plastic container down an alley. \nA piece of wood had been placed on top of the Ronseal tub that was found in Bestwood, Nottingham. \nThe RSPCA are now investigating after a member of the public discovered the chickens on Friday. \nRSPCA inspector Dave McAdam said: \"They were kept in incredibly cramped conditions and had no access to food and water. We can't say for sure how long they had been in this situation for, however, they were suffering unnecessarily. The five birds had no access to food or water. Credit: RSPCA/PA \n\"It is saddening that owners feel the need to abandon animals for whatever reason. \n\"Had they not been found, they would have likely been attacked by foxes or cats.\" \nThe birds are now being looked after by the RSPCA and anyone with information is asked to call 0300 123 8018.
