Ben Hopkins and Liv Bruce of PWR BTTM made catchy punk for outliers on their debut album, Ugly Cherries , and have since become role models for contagious self-confidence. \n\"Big Beautiful Day\" is their new how-to anthem on achieving the same. “There are men in every town/Who live to bring you down,” Hopkins sings over raucous guitar. “My advice is to look incredible/As you make their lives regrettable/By being your damn self.” Though the queer-identified duo splash themselves in sequins and glitter, and even the band's instruments embrace showmanship by sporting googly eyes, PWR BTTM aren't all about literals; \"Big Beautiful Day\" aims to redefine masculinity and the fortitude of individuality. Instead of scolding people of passive homophobia who may have come from restrictive upbringings, Hopkins stresses the importance of exposing them to the truth: There's nothing to fear. So yes, definitely use the brightest hue in that 36-color eyeshadow palette—we all have a shade still untouched by a makeup brush—to see how it feels to be bold, but remember that it pales in comparison to sprucing up your inner self.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:06:15.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
