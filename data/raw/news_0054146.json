It did, however, better the previous high of 91.4 per cent set by the 2014 cohort. \nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had on Thursday wished the students well on his Facebook page, and urged them to take their time to consider their interests and strengths before pursuing them. \nHe added: \"Your early 20s are a great time for self discovery and adventure. Remember to stay focussed, motivated, and driven. All the best!\" \nThe A-level curriculum was revised in 2006, with the first cohort of candidates taking their examinations in 2007. The pass percentage has steadily increased since then, with 87.5 per cent of the 2007 cohort achieving a similar standard of passes. \nSchool candidates would have been issued their result slips by their schools from 2.30pm on Friday, while private candidates will be notified of their individual results by post. \nPrivate candidates who are eligible for SingPass can also use their account to obtain their results online via the Internet Examination Results Release System (iERRS) on SEABâ€™s website from 2.30pm on Friday, MOE said. - CNA/kk ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T10:01:10.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
