Not this one. Until then, I will reserve my comments,\" Harbhajan told the Indian Express. \n\"Test cricket should last five days. You cannot play on such wickets where anyone runs in to bowl and takes wickets. \n\"I know how hard I had to work to earn every single wicket. \n\"When you prepare such a wicket, you are making conditions favourable for the opposition ... you don't need to flight the ball or anything. You just need to bowl fast and not give the batsmen room.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T14:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T09:29:37.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
