San Francisco 49ers (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 11:12 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 11:12 a.m. ET \nNew 49ers general manager John Lynch has a chance to make a splash in next month's NFL Draft and could do so with a stockpile of picks, should he be able to trade the No. 2 overall pick. \nThe Niners already have 10 picks in the draft but Lynch is willing to trade his highest pick for additional ones as he looks to build a roster for the future after struggling the past three seasons. \nMORE: NFL Mock Draft 2017 \n\"We could stay pat right there and find a fabulous player, a game-changing player,\" Lynch said, via the San Francisco Chronicle . \"It gives us a lot of flexibility to do some other things if we chose to be bold. There are going to be people that covet the pick we have, so there's going to be some people that want to move up.\" \nMany expect the 49ers to make a pre-draft move to land a veteran quarterback, then keep building their defensive line by taking Alabama's Jonathan Allen with the No. 2 pick â€” if they decide to keep it. \nLynch has plenty of options but the more draft picks the better for a roster in shambles after going 2-14 this past season, its third straight year without a winning record. \nHere are the 49ers' current draft picks: \nFirst round: No. 2 overall Second round: No. 34 overall Third round: No. 66 overall Fourth round: No. 109 overall Fourth round: No. 143 overall (compensatory) Fifth round: No. 146 overall Fifth round: No. 161 (pick acquired from Washington in 2015 trade for Derek Carrier) Sixth round: No. 186 overall Sixth round: No. 202 overall (pick acquired from Denver in 2015 trade for Vernon Davis) Seventh round: No. 219 overall (pick acquired from Cleveland in 2015 trade for Andy Lee) Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T18:34:32.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
