(Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech/T. Pyle)\nNASA will make a major announcement related to exoplanets at a press conference at the agency’s headquarters in Washington, DC Wednesday.\nIn a press release sent out Monday, NASA said that its press event will address a “discovery beyond our solar system.” The press conference, it added will “present new findings on planets that orbit stars other than our sun, known as exoplanets.”\nThomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington will participate in the briefing, along with experts from MIT, the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, and NASA’s Spitzer Science Center at Caltech/IPAC.\nASTRONOMERS DISCOVER 60 NEW WORLDS, FIND 'SUPER EARTH'\nDetails of the findings are embargoed by the journal Nature until 1 p.m. EST, according to NASA.\nCNET said that it had seen the research in an article published Monday, adding that “while we can't share details yet, let's just say it could very easily provide us with new settings for many future works of science fiction.”\nExoplanets have certainly been in the spotlight recently.\nNEW NEIGHBOR: SCIENTISTS DISCOVER CLOSEST HABITABLE EXOPLANET\nLast week an international team of astronomers announced the discovery of 60 new planets orbiting stars close to Earth’s solar system, including a rocky “super Earth.”\nThe experts also found evidence of an additional 54 planets, bringing the potential discovery of new worlds to 114.\nOne planet in particular, Gliese 411b, has been generating plenty of attention. Described as a “hot super Earth with a rocky surface,” Gliese 411b is located in the fourth-nearest star system to the Sun, making it the third-nearest planetary system to the Sun, according to the U.K.’s University of Hertfordshire, which participated in the research. Gliese 411b (also known as GJ 411b or Lalande 21185) orbits the star Gliese 411 (or GJ 411).\n'SUPERFLARES' LIKELY MADE PROXIMA B UNINHABITABLE LONG AGO\nGliese 411 and Gliese 411b are located 8 light years from earth. A light year, which measures distance in space, equals 6 trillion miles.\nBy way of comparison, the recently-discovered Earth-like planet Proxima b, which orbits the red dwarf Proxima Centauri, is about 4 light years from Earth. A red dwarf is a relatively cool small star.\nProxima Centauri is the star closest to Earth outside of our solar system. Scientists announced the discovery of Proxima b last year, noting that the planet is 1.3 times the size of Earth. Depending on the conditions there, Proxima b could potentially support life , according to experts.", "external_links": ["https://www.cnet.com/news/nasa-space-exoplanet-preview-sara-seager/", "https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-to-host-news-conference-on-discovery-beyond-our-solar-system", "http://earthsky.org/space/what-is-a-light-year"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:32:46.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
