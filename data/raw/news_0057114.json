It comes under the Shrawasti district. (Source: PTI) \nAs the politically crucial Uttar Pradesh is all set to witness its fourth out of the seven-phased Assembly elections, tight security arrangements are being made in 53 constituencies spread across 12 districts where the voting will take place on February 23. Fate of more than 650 candidates are in the fray as districts including Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Allahabad, Mahoba, Banda, Hamirpur, Jalaun, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Chitrakoot and Fatehpur will go for polls on Thursday. All major parties including Samajwadi Party (SP), Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ), Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have put high stakes with an intention to form government with full majority. As the state has seen some high decibel rallies and roadshows, PM Narendra Modi , UP CM Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Mayawati has been among the host of leaders who have kept the balls rolling for their respective parties. While the ruling SP has put a lot in stakes in order to retain its governance in the state, PM Modi-led BJP stands tall as one of the strongest competitors in this political run. Though the incumbent CM of the state has managed to build an image of ‘leader for youth’ and have gained a huge vote bank in various regions of the state, some blame him for the poor law-and-order situation in the state. BJP’s star campaigner, PM Modi, during his surged campaigning spree has constantly targeted the SP-Congress alliance and the BSP for corruption in their regime. \nInterestingly, Mayawati-led BSP has made it a high-octane three way battle. The party cemented itself as one of leading contenders in the pools, but is still behind in terms of vote bank apart from some particular communities. Even the votes of Muslim community have gone to her in limited areas where the candidates fielded are very strong. The high-octane assembly elections are in full swing in India’s most populous state and is expected to lay the cornerstone for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. While SP aims at retaining its power, this time with the Congress, both BJP and BSP are fighting to make a comeback. \nShrawasti is constituency No. 290 of Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly. It comes under the Shrawasti district. \nNumber of voters Shrawasti has a total of 3,36,941 registered voters. \nWhat are the key issues Development and women safety are some prime issues in this region. \nWho was the winner last time SP won this constituency by a margin of 11,205 votes during the 2012 Assembly elections. Muhammad Ramjan from SP bagged 67,551 votes followed by Vinod Tripathi of BSP who got 56,346 votes. \nYou might also want to see this: \nWho are the competing candidates Muhammad Ramjan (SP), Vinod Tripathi (RLD), Subhash (BSP) and Ram Feran (BJP) \nWhy this constituency is important? The SP-Congress alliance is doing the tricks in this region. Congress has not made any remarkable impact in Shrawasti constituency since years, but after joining hands with the ruling party, people would surely vote for the alliance as Akhilesh Yadav has a strong vote bank in this region of the state. Even the Muslim community is preferring the alliance making roads tough for both BJP and BSP. Please Wait while comments are loading...
