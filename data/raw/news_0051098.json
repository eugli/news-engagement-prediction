All I'd read of their purpose was matters of the heart. I'd felt earlier how the r. q. stones made me feel, happier & lighter. I'd left the stones on a dresser next to my bed. The flu overtook me on a sub-zero night. I went from chills, to weakness and to bed. Within a half hour I began to feel warm, than hot. Even the back of my hands were perspiring. I'd taken fever reducer (for chills) an hour prev, no help. The fever shot up quickly to 103. I saw the stones in reach-- instinctively laid them on my pounding, burning forehead. They felt so cool. Immediately I began to cool down. The rose quartz seemed to literally absorb the fever from my forehead and cheeks. The fever began dropping immediately. Afterward, I was diagnosed w/ a detached retina from fever. I was stunned to read rose quartz also cures fevers. It's true--great for babies! ~MoonLitNite \nGiveaway Crystal - I personally find rose quartz to be a healing stone for emotional issues.

After an incredibly bad week with several losses, I was in a deep depression and couldn't shake it. I happened to glance at the stones and picked up the rose quartz.

I don't know why I was attracted to that particular stone, but I will never be without it again! ~No body's Girl \nHeart-to-Heart Distant Healer - My favorite gemstone to use for anything is rose quartz.
