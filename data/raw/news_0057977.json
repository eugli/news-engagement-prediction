Lord Neuberger, President of the Supreme Court, also joined the chorus of complaint. Lord Neuberger, who earlier this month declared that some press criticism was ‘undermining the judiciary for no good reason’, said in a speech this week that ‘there is no doubt that the heavy workload of a judge coupled with the increasing gap between judicial pay and the rewards of successful private practice means that appointment to the High Court is significantly less attractive than it was.’ The pay rises have been styled by Miss Truss as a ‘temporary recruitment and retention allowance.’ They will go to an unknown number of the 25 Appeal Court judges and 100-plus High Court judges who are calculated to have lost out in reforms of the judicial pension scheme pushed through by David Cameron’s government in 2015. Lord Neuberger said ‘there is no doubt that the heavy workload of a judge coupled with the increasing gap between judicial pay and the rewards of successful private practice means that appointment to the High Court is significantly less attractive than it was’ Other public sector workers have seen their pensions made less generous in recent years as ministers have tried to reduce high and rising costs to the taxpayer, and very few private sector employees have escaped major pension reductions over the past decade. But only judges have won any compensation for reductions to their pensions. Last autumn more than 200 judges took their pension complaints to an employment tribunal, with some represented by the controversial law firm Leigh Day, where a founder and another partner face misconduct charges over discredited claims of abuse by British troops in Iraq. An employment judge ruled in January that the reforms discriminated against younger judges. Miss Truss’ pay hikes will apply to judges who were affected by the pension changes, including those appointed to judicial posts since April 2012, or those who were in their jobs in April 2012 but aged under 51 years and six months at the time. High Court judges are now on £179,768, so with the new £19,774 allowance’ those who qualify will earn £199,542 this year. Court of Appeal judges get £204,695, so with the temporary allowance of £22,516 and they will if they meet the right criteria get £227,211 this year. The allowances will be paid up to June next year, when the Senior Salaries Review Board will publish a review of judicial pay, which is widely expected to be sympathetic to the judges’ claims. The increases were announced to judges by Chancellor of the High Court Lord Justice Vos, who circulated his colleagues with a message which said that Miss Truss ‘recognised that a fair and effective remuneration scheme was critical to the continued attraction and retention of high calibre judges, and that she fully understood the current concerns around pay and pensions.’ A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: ‘It is absolutely paramount that we get the right people into the High Court, which also offers a crucial pipeline into the higher judiciary. ‘We are introducing a temporary, targeted allowance to make sure we attract the very brightest talent and help stop our exceptional judges from leaving early.’ But criminologist Dr David Green, director of the Civitas think tank, asked: ‘Is there any evidence that judges are quitting. I have not seen any.’ Strict rules designed to prevent corruption say that judges who step down cannot return to the courts to work as barristers or solicitors. Dr Green said: ‘The proper principle is simple. Pay restraints which apply to everyone else in the public sector should be applied to senior judges. The Government appears to be making an exception and it shouldn’t. ‘I do not oppose proper pay for judges – pay is a mark of respect and also makes corruption a lot less likely. But when there are pay constraints for others they should not get an increase.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:19:03.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
