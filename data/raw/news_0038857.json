Handout photo Bon Jovi openers the Former Me took a chance with video audition contest ( … ) \nThe Former Me. Handout photo \nThe Former Me is used to performing at smaller venues such as Cicero’s, the Ready Room, Pop’s, the Firebird and Fubar. But for its next gig, the St. Louis pop-punk band is prepping for Scottrade Center. \nThe Former Me was selected to open Sunday for Bon Jovi’s “This House Is Not for Sale Tour.” The Former Me submitted a video of a performance of its song “Crawl,” filmed in November at the Ready Room, as part of a contest Bon Jovi held on Facebook in January. \n“I thought nothing would become of it,” says guitarist Ryan Coyle. “We’d done contests for Warped Tour and Pointfest and never won. This is absolutely better than the others. It’ll be seen by many more people than any of those other shows could’ve offered us. We’re really thankful to Bon Jovi and Live Nation. \n“It’s insane, and it’s just weird.” \nWhen the band entered the contest, guitarist Matt Grimsley says, they thought they were just taking a chance. “We thought maybe we could get some exposure — that somebody could see our music.” \nWhen Grimsley got the email saying they’d won the slot, which also includes getting splashed across the official Bon Jovi and Live Nation Facebook pages, he had to do a double take. “I just didn’t believe it. I was completely shocked.” \nThe band had little time to get over the shock and prepare its set. \n“It’s nerve-wracking,” Coyle says. “It’s 100 times bigger than anything we’ve ever done before.” \n“But we’re just going to go up there and do what we do and hope people respond to the music,” Grimsley says. \nThe Former Me doesn’t list Bon Jovi as one of its influences. That honor goes to younger bands including State Champs, Knuckle Puck, Four Year Strong and, of course, Blink-182. \n“I wouldn’t say I’m the biggest Bon Jovi fan. But as of (the day the band won the contest), I’m the biggest Bon Jovi fan,” Coyle says. \n“Bon Jovi is before my era. But my mom listened to them when I was younger, and the first song my guitar teacher taught me to play was ‘Dead or Alive,’” Grimsley says. \nBack when the Former Me shot its video at the Ready Room, during a gig opening for Bowling for Soup, they thought it would serve as a promo for its upcoming EP. \nThe band hired Megan Fairless to shoot the video. “Crawl” was produced by Kevin Gates (not the rapper) of REACH Audio in Springfield, Mo. “It’s the song we’ve been pushing,” Coyle says. “We don’t know yet if it’s going to be the first single.” \nThe band is eyeing a May release for its EP, “I Know This Gets Better.” It’s the follow-up to “Some Truth to This” (2014). \nCoyle says the new EP presents cleaner execution compared to the earlier project. \n“I just think, with this collection of songs, we put more heart into it,” Grimsley says. “It’s more real to us. And the title fits lyrically with all the songs we’ve done and everything happening to us now.” \nThe Former Me formed in 2012 with Dylan Lahey (vocals), Adam Kopchak (drums) and Killian Deluca (bass). Coyle and Grimsley both joined the band later. \nWhat Bon Jovi’s “This House Is Not for Sale Tour,” the Former Me • When 7:30 p.m. Sunday • Where Scottrade Center, 1401 Clark Avenue • How much $27.75-$137.75 with limited tickets available at $382.75, $452.75 and $552.75 • More info ticketmaster.com Go!
