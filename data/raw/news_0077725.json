Photo: AP \nCalling for Trump Attorney-General Jeff Sessions to step away from any Justice Department investigations of the Russia allegations, GOP congressman Darrell Issa told Bill Maher on HBO: You're going to need to use the [independent] special prosecutor's statute and office\". \nExplaining that Sessions deferring to his deputy would be less than independent, Issa said: \"you can't have somebody - a friend of mine, Jeff Sessions - who was on the campaign and who is a [Trump] appointee… you're going to need to use the special prosecutor's statute and office. You can't just give it to your deputy. That's another political appointee\". \nDespite Priebus' claims last week that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had described as \"BS\" a report by The New York Times , which revealed extensive communications between people in the Trump campaign and figures in Russia, former CIA director John Brennan, told CBS' Face the Nation that various investigations were in their early stages and that no one yet knew where the facts would lead. \nBrennan, a George W Bush security appointee who later became director of the CIA under Barack Obama, implicitly challenged the veracity of the Priebus claim that apart from meeting McCabe, he also had discussed the investigation with FBI director James Comey. \nSaying he doubted Comey would have talked to the White House chief of staff about an ongoing investigation, Brennan argued: \"It's been my experience, working with [Comey], that he wouldn't do anything to compromise the integrity of an ongoing investigation\". \nBrennan then made an observation that likely caused tremors in the White House: \"Anybody who claims that the facts are already known in terms of what did or didn't happen between Russian officials and US persons during the election, I think, is speaking very prematurely. \n\"And the White House needs to understand that the interaction with the FBI on criminal investigations is something that really they need to steer clear of.\" \nArguing against the appointment of a special prosecutor, Christie's pushback seemed rooted more in anxiety about the administration losing political control of the investigations that in his faith in the existing investigations. \nA former federal prosecutor, Christie told CNN's State of the Union : \"The Justice Department, over the course of time, has shown itself, with the professionals that are there, to have the ability to investigate these type of things, [and] when a special prosecutor gets involved, the thing gets completely out of control. And I think that doesn't serve anybody's purposes\". \nWarning the administration that it had to remain at arm's length from the FBI inquiry \"because perceptions matter,\" Christie also said: \"We have a lot of important problems to deal with in this country. And this is - I'm not saying that is not one of them, but I believe the Justice Department can handle it\". \nWhite House deputy spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders used an appearance on ABC's This Week to double down on the Trump denials – and to use Priebus' unsupported claim that the FBI had dismissed one NYT report to imply that the entirety of the matters under investigation are without foundation. \n\"The FBI has already said this story is BS,\" she said. \"Those were their words, so I apologise to my mum. But literally those are the words of the FBI, that the story is BS.\" \nSanders insisted that the various congressional and security agency investigations would come up empty-handed – \"we're extremely confident that, whatever review, they're all going to come to the same conclusion: that we had no involvement in this.\" \nOne observation she made was telling – \"just because reporters say something over and over and over again doesn't start to make it true\". \nIt was telling because the converse, as Brennan implied on CBS' Face the Nation , is equally valid - just because Trump and his surrogates issue denials over and over, doesn't make it false.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:59:03.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
