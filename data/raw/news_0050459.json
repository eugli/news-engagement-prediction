At 70, with many trials and triumphs behind him, Carreras is still a superstar.\nThe tenor was partnered by local soprano Antoinette Halloran, who was appropriately deferential and projected bright, youthful vivacity to counter the tenor’s dignitas and self-assurance.\nThe Melbourne Symphony Orchestra was conducted with grace and artistry by the well-known conductor David Gimenez.\nGimenez is the son of Carreras’ sister, and is accompanying his uncle on what is billed as Carreras’ last world tour.\nThe affectionate relationship between the two men was a delightful part of the concert, with Gimenez striding purposefully behind Carreras when the maestro walked, a little stiffly, on and off the stage.\nThe concert began slowly, with Carreras leaving the stage briefly between each song or aria.\nThings really took off after interval when Carreras rose to the ecstatic reception of his audience and showed that strength and stamina are still part of his battery of attributes.\nPerhaps the highlight was Carreras’ beautiful rendition of Core ‘ngrato, the achingly lovely Neapolitan song whose historically famous exponents include Carreras’ early inspirations, Giuseppe di Stefano and Mario Lanza.\nLittle touches marked Carreras as a suave and gentlemanly leading man. He ensured Halloran stood between himself and Gimenez as she took her bow. And those who looked closely could see Carreras encourage Halloran during the concert with a quick wink or a warm smile.\nIt has been said that Carreras owes his success to making everyone in the auditorium feel as though he is singing to them alone.\nIt must be a swooning feeling to actually share the stage with such a man and such a voice.", "external_links": ["http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/49f47610684219b45cf65c1ad6ab9251?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop"], "published": "2017-02-19T17:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:40:20.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
