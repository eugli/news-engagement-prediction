The warning notice, issued on Thursday, February 16, gives the council powers to formally step in if the school does not comply with its requirements. \nGovernors have blamed a \"backlog of paperwork\" for the unresolved grievances at Bollin.

The first walkout is planned on Thursday, February 23. \nUnion bosses say the dispute centres around workload, \"excessive scrutiny\" and an \"obsession\" with data relating to pupil progress.

One parent, who has asked not to be identified, said: \"We know we are lucky to live in a nice affluent area with a good school. \n\"But there has been a growing groundswell of outrage at the way Bollin is being run.\" \nBut headteacher Michelle Brindle has defended her leadership, arguing that the school had a \"long line\" of exciting things ahead this year. \nShe said: \"As headteacher, I am one hundred per cent committed to my position, the pupils and the team. I want to work alongside parents and the governors to make the school a happy and inspirational environment for both the children and staff.\" \nThe last time the school was inspected by Ofsted was in 2007 when it was rated as \"outstanding\".
