The Constant Phoenix nuclear ‘sniffer plane’ has been sent to the UK and is rumoured to looking for the source of the radiation. Picture: US Air Force Source: Supplied \nThe alarm was first raised in January by the IRSN, the French Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety Institute. \nThe public body said the cloud of I-131 had first been detected in northern Norway in the second week of January. Norway’s remote north, above the Arctic Circle, borders Russia. \nThe isotope was subsequently detected in Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, France and finally in Spain, as the wind carried it from the north of Europe to the continent’s south west. \nAt high enough levels I-131 can cause deadly thyroid cancers. However, it also used in radiation treatments to combat cancers. \nIn a statement, the IRSN stated “Iodine-131 is a radionuclide with a short half-life. The detection of this radionuclide is proof of a rather recent release.” So brief is I-131’s eight day half-life, the origin of the release must have occurred in early January. \nHowever, the organisation stressed there was “no health concerns” due to the release. \nWith the source of the release still unknown, the US has sent one of its two Boeing WC-135 nuclear ‘sniffer planes’ to the UK. \nFlying into an air base in eastern England last week it has now reportedly been sent to northern Norway.

Crew on the aircraft then analyse the particles to check for radioactivity. The adapted WC-135 sniffer plane sucks in gases through scoops ion its side for on board crew to analyse. Source: News Limited \nA positive identification of I-131 by the plane is one of the telltale signs of a nuclear explosion. \nBut other key indicators, such as non-natural seismic activity, have not been reported casting doubt on whether an explosion is the leak’s cause. \nIn addition, no other radioactive material has been picked up \nThe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation , which polices various Governments’ commitments to not test nuclear weapons, said that while I-131 had been recorded it was within “local historical levels”. \n“If a nuclear test were to take place that releases I-131 it would also be expected to release many other radioactive isotopes. No other nuclear fission isotopes have been measured at elevated levels in conjunction with I-131 in Europe so far,” the organisation said in a statement this week. Has the leak come from a Russian nuclear submarine? This Typhoon (Akula) class sub is seen off Russia's Arctic Coast. Source: AP \nOne explanation is that the isotope may have leaked from a pharmaceutical facility where I-131 is produced for medical reasons. \nHowever, no pharmaceutical lab has come forward to claim the I-131 as their own. \nAnother possibility is that the plume may have escaped from a Russian nuclear submarine sailing through the Arctic. \nThe mystery comes at a time of deep wariness between Russia and the US following the former’s annexation of the Crimea and the backing of armed rebels in Eastern Ukraine. \nJust last week, it was revealed Russian jets buzzed a US destroyer off the coast of Romania which the Navy slammed as “unsafe and unprofessional”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:59:04.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
