(Getty Images) \nUpdated at 3:54 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 3:54 p.m. ET \nMusic is the universal language, so why not try to use it to heal a relationship with two people who aren't on speaking terms? \nThat's what Warriors coach Steve Kerr jokingly posited he do as coach of the NBA Western Conference All-Stars, a team that will feature feuding superstars and former teammates in the Thunder's Russell Westbrook and Golden State's Kevin Durant. \nMORE: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook end up at same OKC restaurant after Saturday’s game \n\"Maybe we'll sing a song,\" Kerr quipped, when asked about his plans for coaching Westbrook and four Warriors — Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. \nWestbrook and Durant are allegedly not on speaking terms , and are coming off a Golden State demolition of Oklahoma City on Saturday. \nDespite the joke, it doesn't sound like Kerr thinks the two will sing kumbaya this weekend. \n\"To be honest, I haven't read much about it so I don't know what they're saying to each other or at each other,\" Kerr said. \"I think if anything, this might be a great opportunity to sit down and talk. But I don't know if that's necessarily going to happen [in New Orleans].\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:46:33.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
