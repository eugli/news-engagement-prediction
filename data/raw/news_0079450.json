But it should be noted that Atlanta actually had the first score after halftime on a 6-yard Matt Ryan touchdown pass to Tevin Coleman. \nIt must be a tough pill to swallow when you were on the edge of glory like that, but we’re going to go out on a limb and say Lady Gaga had absolutely nothing to do with the collapse. \nThumbnail photo via Matthew Emmons/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:33:46.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
