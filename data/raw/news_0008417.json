Ad Feedback \n\"We are concerned for the communities that this organisation wants to deliver alcohol to,\" Jackson said. \n\"The evidence points quite clearly that these communities will have an increase in assault and drink driving incidents because of this increase in availability,\" Jackson said. \nShe said she was concerned that On The Rocks did not have an age identification check to enter its website. \n\"When you look at other types of sites similar to this one, they at least have that gateway. \n\"I think we need to keep a close eye on these companies, particularly with the potential sale of alcohol to minors,\" Jackson said. \nChacko said its delivery drivers had all completed an alcohol management course. \nHe said he had met with police and Auckland Council to talk through their concerns and all drivers had completed an alcohol management course. \nIf a customer was intoxicated they would not hand over alcohol, he said. \nIn 2015 Wellington booze delivery company Quenched faced huge backlash and closed its website just a week after launching. \nIt faced criticism over its slogans which included, \"Delivering happiness\", \"Need booze quick? We'll have it to your door in 45 minutes. Don't stop the party at your place early, we are here to help\". \nOn The Rocks said it delivered within two hours. \nA McDonald's spokesman said it was not aware On The Rocks would be delivering its food. \n\"Aside from Menulog, which is part of our home delivery trial in New Lynn and Glenfield, we don't have any formal relationship with delivery companies,\" the spokesman said. \nHe said On The Rocks was using McDonald's images on its website without permission. \n\"While businesses are able to offer the delivery service, they are not allowed to use our trademarks in their marketing. \n\"Typically we would ask businesses using our trademarks without our permission to stop doing so,\" the spokesman said. \nThe spokesman said he was not aware of any other company selling alcohol alongside McDonald's in New Zealand. \n\"In some countries, mainly Europe, McDonald's sells beer, but nothing in New Zealand,\" he said. \nChacko said the company had an off-site liquor licence. \n\"It is my understanding we do not need a license for the food delivery as we are not making it. \n\"All food is bagged by the companies who produce it and we just act as a third party when we deliver it,\" Chacko said. \nPolice have been approached for comment. - Stuff ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:42:51.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
