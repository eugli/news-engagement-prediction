The team announced on Tuesday that it will not pick up Adrian Peterson’s option for 2017, making him a free agent next week. “Adrian is an important part of the Minnesota Vikings organization,” said Vikings General Manager Rick Spielman . “We will continue to have conversations with his representatives and leave our future options open while determining what is best for both parties moving forward.” \nPeterson was set to make $18 million next season if the Vikings had picked up his option, keeping him as the highest-paid running back in the NFL. At 31 years old and coming off of a season in which he played just three games, the Vikings clearly felt they would better themselves by opening up cap space. \nHe’s played just one full season the past four years, including two seasons in which he played fewer than four games. In 2015, he rushed for 1,485 yards and 11 touchdowns. \nThough Peterson will be a free agent, it’s not definite that he’ll be wearing another uniform in 2017. The Vikings, as Spielman alluded to, will still have the chance to bring Peterson back, albeit on a much more financially friendly contract.
