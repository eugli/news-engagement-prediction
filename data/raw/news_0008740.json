(Photo by Pattarapong Chatpattarasill) - + Akarakit Worarojchroendet, a car racer who rose to fame after he married an actress, has denied knowing the Lao drug kingpin Xaysana Keopimpha who was arrested earlier last month. \nAfter several hours of questioning at the Narcotics Suppression Bureau (NSB), Mr Akarakit told a large group of reporters at around 10pm on Friday that he did not know Mr Xaysana. He said he came to meet police to give his statements and evidence and asked the public not to judge him too soon. \nThe police and anti-money laundering officials believe the husband of TV star Napapa \"Pat\" Tantrakul might have had a connection with Mr Xaysana, who was believed to have laundered drug money by purchasing luxury cars. \nOfficers on Thursday raided Mr Akarakit's Area 51 auto accessories shop and an apartment he owned in Inthamara Soi 51 in Din Daeng district. They seized a Lamborghini suspected of having been acquired with drug money and two big bikes. \nPol Maj Gen Chatri Phaisalsil, deputy NSB commander, said on Friday night that Mr Akarakit told the police he had borrowed 6 million baht in cash from Natthaphol \"Boy\" Nakkham, one of the suspects linked to Mr Xaysana, to be put as the down payment of the Lamborghini and had partially repaid Mr Natthaphol. \nPol Maj Gen Chatri said the two men knew each other because they both liked car racing but Mr Akarakit denied knowing Mr Natthaphol's background. The police will further investigate why Mr Natthaphol transferred 300,000 baht to Area 51's account each month. \nMr Akarakit told the police he bought two big bikes because he liked them and the police found no connection between them and Mr Natthaphol. \nAs for the licence plate of the Lamborghini which did not match the Department of Land Transport's record, Mr Akarakit told the police that he personally liked the number 51 and chose it for the licence plates of all his cars. \nFor the Lamborghini in question, he explained he had not yet got the approval to change the luxury car's licence plate to 51 but he had been using the number because he was convinced he would get the approval. For this, police found he violated the Land Traffic Act. \nLater on Saturday morning, Pol Maj Gen Chatri said the police were not totally convinced by his story about the ownership of the Lamborghini and still suspected he might have held the fancy car on behalf of Mr Natthaphol. \nThe police will also check the money trail of the 6 million baht Mr Akarakit had allegedly borrowed from Mr Natthaphol without collateral.
