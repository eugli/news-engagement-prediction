Greg Clarke has previously admitted that England's chances could be damaged by Brexit Credit: Paul Grover \nT he FA has declared an interest in hosting 2030 World Cup and Euro 2028 and Clarke said it could be forced to enter in a joint bid with an EU member state. \nCeferin cited the decision to deny Paris St Germain defender Serge Aurier entry to the UK last year for his club’s Champions League game at Arsenal as an example of the issues Brexit could cause. \nAurier was appealing a conviction for assault at the time and Ceferin told the New York Times : “I was very disappointed when Aurier, from PSG, was not allowed to enter England. \n“That will worsen when Brexit happens, especially if the reasons were as formal. We could have a serious problem.” \nCeferin said he had no problem if the UK wanted to withhold visas from “a severe criminal”. 50 Football Manager 2017 wonderkids \n“But if we see that players cannot enter because they have any sort of procedure ongoing, then we will simply think if we should play our European matches there,” he added. \n“Neymar and Lionel Messi both have [tax evasion] procedures going on. This year, the Champions League final is in Cardiff. Imagine if they did not let them in. \n“That is a big thing for us, if players from England can travel anywhere but players from other teams cannot travel to England. With free movement in Europe, it is much better. \n“Even in 2020, if Brexit has happened, then it can be a big problem for fans. That stays firm, and we will speak to the British government, and I am sure the English Football Association will help us.” Watch | Klopp: Brexit, Trump, Ranieri...just another strange decision 01:01 \nO n US president Trump’s proposed new travel ban to replace the one overturned by a federal court this month, Ceferin said it would “not help” the country’s hopes of staging the 2026 World Cup. \nAmerica is currently the firm favourite to be awarded the tournament, potentially as co-hosts with Mexico, Canada and other North American nations. \n“It will be part of the evaluation, and I am sure it will not help the United States to get the World Cup,” said Ceferin, who is also a vice-president of Fifa. \n“If players cannot come because of political decisions, or populist decisions, then the World Cup cannot be played there. It is true for the United States, but also for all the other countries that would like to organise a World Cup. \n“It is the same for the fans, and the journalists, of course. It is the World Cup. They should be able to attend the event, whatever their nationality is. But let’s hope that it does not happen.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:05:09.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
