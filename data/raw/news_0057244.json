Mr Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper Democratic Movement), Mr Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) and Mr Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress). \nThe other posts that NASA is using to cement the alliance's power base are those of Senate Speaker, Senate Majority Leader and Leader of Majority in Parliament. \nSources familiar with the discussions confided that even though the details still remain at proposal stage, the leaders have tentatively agreed on the power-sharing formula but fear a leakage at this stage may expose them to Jubilee's manipulation and attack. \nThe four principals are expected to sign the coalition agreement today, deposit it with the Registrar of Political Parties and later address a political rally at Jevanjee Gardens to tell their supporters about the contents of the document and way forward. \nAt the heart of the deal is a formula to ensure that all the four principals will be accommodated in a NASA government should the alliance triumph in the August 8 polls. The agreement provides that the NASA flag-bearer must be the most popular candidate among the four.
