Priyanka is holding the command of poll campaigning in both the prestigious parliamentary constituencies.\n\"From Lucknow, Lalu Prasad will visit different assembly segments in Rae Bareilly on Tuesday and campaign in favour of the SP-Congress alliance. Tuesday is the last day for campaigning in Rae Bareilly district that is going to polls in the fourth phase on February 23,\" RJD chief's public relations officer Syed Shamim told TOI.\nHe said the RJD chief would campaign in different assembly segments of Amethi on Wednesday. Voting is scheduled for Amethi on February 27 in the fifth phase.\n\"We are yet to receive the name of assembly segments where Lalu Prasad will campaign. The assembly segments will be decided by Priyanka Gandhi and Lalu ji will get the list when he will start for Rae Bareilly on Tuesday morning,\" a political aide of the RJD chief told TOI on Monday.\nBefore leaving for UP, Lalu attacked PM Narendra Modi for making unsuccessful attempt to divide voters on communal line by raising issues like 'Shamshan' and 'Kabristan'.\nSlamming the PM with a tinge of sarcasm, Lalu asked, \"Who has stopped you from constructing cremation grounds and waiving farmers' loans? Should a person with a 56-inch chest mislead the country by resorting to meek ways?\"\nIn a tweet posted on Monday, Lalu said that PM Narendra Modi is a dictator and the unity and integrity of the country is not safe under his leadership.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:41:16.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
