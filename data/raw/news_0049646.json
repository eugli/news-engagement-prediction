Cargill-Cramer replaces Thomas Tongue , who is staying on as president of the incubator in a volunteer role. The downtown Troy, New York, incubator offers manufacturing and office space to startups, as well as access to welding machines and 3-D printers. 13 photos Holly Cargill-Cramer was named the new executive director of the Tech Valley Center of… more The hire comes as the Center of Gravity has gone through some significant changes in the last two years. In 2015, the center moved to its current location in downtown Troy's Quackenbush Building from a space that was a McDonald's. The $3 million restoration of the formerly vacant building at Broadway and Third Street in Troy has been heralded as a game changer for tech companies around Albany. Developer and building owner David Bryce handled the restoration. The first floor is where the Tech Valley Center of Gravity is located. The upper floors include office space for ChannelEyes and other tech companies like Boogie, Pinhole Press and SpaceoutVR. Soon after the Center of Gravity moved to the Quackenbush Building, its founder, Laban Coblentz , left the incubator to take a job in France. Coblentz created the Tech Valley Center of Gravity in 2012 as a place to foster entrepreneurship and talent graduating from area colleges including Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Russell Sage College and Union College. Since it was founded, the center has grown to 500 members. Cargill-Cramer will be responsible for increasing the Center of Gravity's visibility, creating new community and professional relationships, and developing new programs for members. She has more than 25 years of experience in communications and nonprofit management. Cargill-Cramer is a 1994 graduate of The College of Saint Rose in Albany and previously worked with SUNY Cobleskill, the New York State Restaurant Association and the Albany-Colonie Regional Chamber of Commerce. While the majority of the center's money has come from membership dues, the Center of Gravity has received support from the state. The center was recently named a NYS Certified Business Incubator. That comes with up to $125,000 in annual funding for five years to expand and scale incubation services for early stage companies. The Center of Gravity was also awarded $75,000 to create the area's first Rapid Prototyping Center with money from the Jeff Lawrence Manufacturing Innovation Fund. The fund is managed by FuzeHub. That gives manufacturers and startups access to professional equipment that would otherwise be out of reach for a startup or small company. Equipment includes a Computer Numerical Control, or CNC, router table, a vacuum-forming machine, a large laser cutter and a plasma cutting table.
