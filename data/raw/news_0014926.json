(Photos by Tawatchai Kemgumnerd) - + UTHAI THANI -- The Department of Special Investigation (DSI) on Monday impounded about 100 blocks of land and buildings, worth about 400 million baht, believed to be linked to the country's biggest loan shark network, known as the Helmet Gang. \nDSI officials, police and soldiers searched 10 houses linked to Wichai Panngam, the 47-year-old alleged leader of the network, early on Monday morning. The properties are in tambon Tha Sung of Muang district. \nThey impounded the deeds to about 100 areas of land and buildings covering about 700 rai in Muang and Nong Khayang districts. \nDSI deputy director-general Suriya Singhakamol said the houses searched included one where Mr Wichai had lived. His ailing parents were staying there. \nThere were lenders in Uthai Thai who were part of Mr Wichai's network, but his parents were unlikely to be involved, he said. \nLate last year the DSI started to impound assets linked to the Helmet Gang. In mid-January, 29 properties worth 42 million baht were impounded in Pathum Thani province. The hunted boss is believed to be hiding overseas. \nJustice authorities believe Mr Wichai headed the biggest loan sharking service in the country. The network was established in 2011, had 86 branches nationwide and charged up to 300% interest per annum. It was also believed to operate in Cambodia. \nInvestigators believe about 1,000 government officials were accomplices, abusing their authority to force debtors to make repayments. The network is said to have included 2,000 black market creditors who had distributed some 4 billion baht to 170,000 borrowers. \nIn December, authorities impounded assets worth more than 150 million baht from the gang. Raids and asset seizures are continuing. TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:55:06.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
