Indian visitors experience a Shinkansen bullet train system simulator in a Japanese pavilion at the International Engineering and Technology Fair in New Delhi on Feb. 26, 2015. The same train is being introduced in India on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad stretch.

Construction of the 7-kilometres (about 4.3 miles) undersea rail corridor between Mumbai and Ahmadabad in western India is slated to begin in 2018. SEE ALSO: How India's 163-year-old railways is using technology to modernise itself \nThe drilling will help ascertain soil conditions under water. \"Soil and rocks below the 70-meter-deep see are being tested as part of the geo-technical and geo-physical investigation undertaken for the entire project,\" a senior Railway Ministry official reportedly said. \nEstimated to cost about Rs 97.6 billion ($14.5 billion), 80% of the project's funding will come by way of a loan from Japan that operates the Shinkansen bullet train between Tokyo and Osaka. India will replicate that system. The project cost includes possible cost escalation, interest during construction and import duties. \nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi who traveled to Japan last year traveled in the Shinkansen bullet train alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \nJapan's decision to give virtually free finance for Modi's pet program is reportedly part of its broader push back against China's involvement in infrastructure development in South Asia over the past several years. \nCurrently it takes about seven hours to travel between the Mumbai and Ahmedabad and the bullet train aims to reduce it to about two hours. Construction of the corridor is expected to be completed by 2023 provided it starts next year. \nAs always, Twitter users had quite a few cents to spare on the topic. Why can't we Americans dream bigger for our trains? If India can work on a bullet train, why can't we? https://t.co/UqKcwJUIts \nâ€” Alyssa Ayres (@AyresAlyssa) February 10, 2017 What we need first?
