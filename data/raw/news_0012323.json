(AAP) \nThere is growing speculation Senator Cory Bernardi will split from the Liberal party to form his own conservative party – possibly as soon as tomorrow morning. \nThe news comes amid plunging poll numbers for Malcolm Turnbull, with this morning’s Newspoll showing the Coalition has the lowest support levels since he ousted Tony Abbott as prime minister. \nNews Corp columnist Andrew Bolt reported today that Mr Bernardi is set to leave the party to form a party based on his Australian Conservatives movement. \nA report by the ABC suggests Senator Bernardi will leave within the next 48 hours, while Fairfax Media proposes he will make the announcement tomorrow morning. \nFairfax said he had informed staff of his decision. \nSpeculation the high-profile senator would leave to form his own party began in November 2016 when he met key members of US President Donald Trump’s campaign team in Washington. \nIt was revealed Senator Bernardi had started up a new website and logo for a group called, “Australian Majority”, which is linked to his Australian Conservative website. \nSenator Bernardi’s office has been contacted for comment. \nFellow SA Liberal Simon Birmingham played down a possible defection, citing his colleague's recent comments. \n\"Every comment I've ever seen Cory make, including over recent months, has been about the importance of Liberals, Nationals, conservatives - all those in the right of centre - working together and working as a strong Coalition,\" he said. It's believed Senator Bernardi will form a conservative party. (AAP) \n\"I'm confident that Cory will stand by his words.\" \nCabinet colleague Matt Canavan said \"of course\" he wanted Senator Bernardi to stay in the coalition. \n\"I love all members of our team and sometimes you don't agree with every member of your team but it's a great team and I hope we keep it together,\" he told reporters in Canberra. \nLabor frontbencher Tony Burke wasn't surprised about the reports. \n\"We've been watching a split in the coalition for more than a year now and it's going to continue to unravel,\" he said. \nCabinet minister Steve Ciobo dismissed suggestions Senator Bernardi's defection would destabilise the government. \n\"What Australia needs is a strong, stable plan for economic growth and jobs,\" he told reporters. \nTreasurer Scott Morrison suggested the senator was being egged on by others. \n\"Lets' see what he announces, if he announces anything at all,\" Mr Morrison told Ray Hadley on Radio 2GB. \nThis morning’s Newspoll shows Labor leading the coalition 54-46 percent. \nThe Newspoll shows the coalition's primary vote plunging four points to 35 per cent. \nLabor's primary vote remains unchanged at 36 per cent, with independents and minor parties earning a surge in support from 15 to 19 per cent. \nThe poll's findings come after a summer of expenses scandals, the resignation of cabinet minister Sussan Ley, and a backlash over the Centrelink debt recovery system. \nGovernment minister Paul Fletcher was reluctant to discuss the poll's findings when quizzed by reporters, insisting the coalition was focused on getting on with meeting the needs of Australians. \n\"That's our priority,\" he said at Canberra airport. \nMeanwhile, One Nation garnered eight percent of the national primary vote in the year’s first Newspoll – doubling its senate vote at the July election. \nSenator Hanson said she wasn’t surprised by the support, refuelling her belief that people “are looking for someone else to vote for”. \nWith AAP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:15:11.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
