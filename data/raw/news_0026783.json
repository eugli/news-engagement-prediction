Kudos to Beyoncé for performing while carrying the two future leaders of The Resistance, but I'd rather she sit out the Grammys if she's going to be performing stunts and shit. If The Chainsmokers ft. Halsey wanted to lean back on chairs or jump off the roof or any other general Cirque De Soleil-type act, I wouldn't really care. But I don't know if we need Beyoncé taking any chances while Jay Z gets to stand comfortably and performatively applaud along to the album that revealed he is a trash husband. \nFortunately, the rest of the performance was fairly subdued, even if Twitter responded (as it always does) with the passion of a thousand exploding suns. Hopefully Beyoncé has since been carried off stage and back to the lush, flower-laden oasis from which she announced her pregnancy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:22:23.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
