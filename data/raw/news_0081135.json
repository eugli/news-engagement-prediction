PUBLISHED: 08:45, Tue, Feb 28, 2017 | UPDATED: 09:53, Tue, Feb 28, 2017 GETTY Gunther Oettinger said Germany must stump up for the EU budget \nGunther Oettinger said eurocrats need even more money to tackle growing crises like migration and the fight against terror at a time when the EU is losing its third largest net contributor. \nHe warned that the massive loss of cash set to be unleashed by Brexit cannot be offset by cuts to the ballooning Brussels budget and will have to be made up by the bloc’s richer countries instead. Related articles Brussels set for mega splurge on eurocrat perks despite Brexit \nJust 10 of the EU’s 28 nations put more money into the project than they get out and it is extremely heavily reliant on just three - Britain, France and Germany - to keep going. \nFrance has endure years of economic stagnation which have prompted growing euroscepticism and the looming threat of Marine Le Pen, leaving Berlin in the firing line once more to pick up the tab. GETTY The suggestion is likely to get short shrift from Angela Merkel EXPRESS The EU is heavily reliant on just three big contributors \nBut with Germany already facing a mammoth bill for housing over a million refugees, which other European nations have refused to take in, the appetite to stump up even more cash for Brussels is limited. \nOn top of that many German taxpayers feel that they have been unfairly required to bankroll successive bailouts of Greece and resent what they see as their hard earned money being squandered in the ‘lazy’ south. \nOfficials in Berlin have already stressed they will not up their mammoth contribution, which amounts to a whopping 20 per cent of the entire EU budget, because of Brexit. \nIn October defiant Deputy Finance Minister Jens Spahn insisted: \"If Britain's contribution falls away, the EU budget will shrink. \n\"There is certainly no automatic mechanism that (would make) Germany and other net contributors increase their contribution.” We also need additional budget resources on top EU budget chief Gunther Oettinger \nBut his comments have now been directly contradicted by Brussels bigwig Mr Oettinger, who said that Germany would be required to come up with the necessary cash. \nIn an interview with Handelsblatt he said Berlin and other net contributors would have to find “something more” to cover a projected £7.7bn black hole in the bloc’s finances. \nThe top eurocrat said some money could be saved by slashing agricultural subsidies - which will be fiercely opposed by France - but added that “we also need additional budget resources on top” to cope with future challenges. \nHe also re-floated the controversial idea of an EU-wide fuel tax, which would add a centime or two onto every litre of petrol, as a way of directly funding the EU project after Brexit. Why these nations could leave the Eurozone Fri, February 24, 2017 Heavily indebted Greece has no acute shortage of money, but will need money again from the ongoing aid programme this summer. But Athens is not the only shaky candidate of the Eurozone. These are the other countries causing worries Play slideshow 1 of 7 \nThe German national was recently controversially appointed EU budget commissioner despite being embroiled in a string of scandals over racially insensitive comments and Russian lobbying. \nBritain’s budget contribution is currently around £8.5bn a year but, with Theresa May having indicated she will pull the UK out of the single market, Brussels is set to lose that cash in 2019. \nEurocrats are already drawing up a massive £50bn exit bill for Westminster in an attempt to temporarily plug their money woes, but that money will not provide a permanent solution for the funding crisis facing the EU.
