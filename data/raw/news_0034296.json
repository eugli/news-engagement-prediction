AT&T's version costs the same as Verizon's -- $180 -- for a family of four but is pricier for an individual. Sprint and T-Mobile are cheaper. \nSprint also said Thursday that it's letting unlimited customers watch video in high definition rather than DVD quality. T-Mobile announced a similar change Monday after Verizon said HD video was included. AT&T's unlimited plan degrades video to DVD quality, but customers can turn HD video back on for free. \n- Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:37:31.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
