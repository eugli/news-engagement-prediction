But after a period of time, the investors would no longer receive the returns as promised,” he said. \nThe couple were arrested on Monday in Sri Petaling. \n“There have been 34 reports made nationwide, and 11 investigation papers opened by the police. The estimated losses from the scam amounted to RM20mil,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:05:04.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
