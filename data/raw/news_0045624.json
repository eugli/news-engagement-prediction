Morrison shared pictures of her at the protest across her social media accounts and soon started receiving requests to buy them. Seizing the opportunity, she set to work making more and put them up for sale online. They are selling for £30 on Morrison’s website and The Z List , a retail site run by her boss Sabine Zetteler (whose PR firm specialises in the creative sector).Morrison decided to donate 10% of the proceeds to Cancer Research UK, to help fight breast cancer.So far she has sold 75 T-shirts, each taking her 30 minutes to make. She says it’s been quite a juggle around her a full-time job, but the T-shirts have helped raise awareness of her brand.\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Morrison’s T-shirts: 10% of the proceeds go to Cancer Research UK.

Opposition to the statements and decisions he has made on immigration and women have inspired many others. Recently Krista Suh and Jayna Zweiman encouraged women across the world to knit pink “pussy hats” to create a visual statement at the women’s marches, while a wave of independent artists have been inspired to create satirical clothing and merchandise. It’s a burgeoning niche for craft entrepreneurs – an “anti Trump” search on eBay brings up more than 5,800 results.\nPatricia van den Akker, director of The Design Trust , an online business school for designers and makers, says: “When something important like [Trump’s election and the subsequent marches] happen then there is often a reaction by creatives.” However, she adds: “I don’t think these products are about making money, but about letting your voice be heard. Especially as a female creative, using the domesticity of craft can be really powerful and humorous.” \nFor Monday’s nationwide march , organised by the Stop Trump coalition, Glasgow-based graphic designer Mhairi Mackenzie and her friends will be wearing her range of four handmade anti-Trump protest badges. They are inspired by placards she spotted at previous marches, but have been given a Scottish twist. “Up until recently I wasn’t particularly politically active, but I felt the need to create something in response to [Trump].” says Mackenzie. Each of her protest products retail at £20 a piece through Bonnie Bling , her laser cut acrylic jewellery company, with £5 from each sale donated to Glasgow-based refugee charity Refuweegee .\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mhairi Mackenzie’s designs: ‘I felt the need to create something.’ Photograph: Mhairi Mackenzie \n“Pictures of the placards people had created around the globe made me feel more hopeful [...] and I was inspired by the creativity that others were putting into their own protests,” she says. When Mackenzie created a badge for herself to wear as her own mini protest, she received so many complimentary comments in person and on Instagram that she decided to sketch some more designs and start selling them on her website. “Within 24 hours I had sold over 100 badges.” \nEllie Kate Gray, a University of West England postgraduate student, has tapped into the anti-Trump feeling with her hand-sewn dolls, which she sells on Etsy. A recent creation is a pin cushion of Donald Trump’s face, which sells for £12. It has proved to be her bestselling item; she has sold around 50 so far. “I started selling it in October, but it has sold better since the election,” says Gray. “Someone in London bought three to send to their family in Mexico.”\nLike Gray, web and graphic designer Jessica Augarde sells the results of her creative hobby through Etsy . Her recent focus is creating vibrant and colourful prints with female centric and anti-Trump political slogans, such as, “Nasty Woman” and “Nevertheless She Persisted”, which she sells for £6 a piece. \n“I’ve found myself becoming increasingly frustrated and saddened at Trump’s actions recently – and I think it’s important to create artwork that promotes causes you believe in,” she says. Her prints have enjoyed a strong response. “The reaction has been very positive – I’ve had really amazing feedback from customers telling me their prints are hanging pride of place in their living room, and are a real talking point.”\n\nMaria Kourtesi, who works as a teacher, recently set up Funky Piñatas. She’s selling a handmade Donald Trump version on Etsy for £42. “I made the Donald Trump one because I am really against his policies and his political views,” she says. “The piñata game for adults – when it becomes political – is really liberating and fun, especially now with all this negative political atmosphere in Europe and US.”\nAs anti-Trump protests continue, products that allow buyers to express political messages should remain in demand. “As long as people keep buying the Trump cushions, I’ll keep making them,” says Gray. \nSign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:19:08.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
