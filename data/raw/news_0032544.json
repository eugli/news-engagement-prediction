It shows the lives of black Americans as they rose through society after the antebellum era. All photographs: Loewentheil Collection of African American Photographs The Loewentheil Collection of African American Photographs features 645 images, and apart from a few starry names such as Martin Luther King and Muhammad Ali, it documents the lives of ordinary African Americans – the handwriting in the corner of this image reads ‘Fred Jones’ The photos date from the 1860s to the 1960s, an era when African Americans were emerging from the horrors of slavery and beginning to claim some of the freedoms white Americans had ‘One of the goals – both of the Loewentheils in putting the collection together and ours in putting the digital collection online – is to push back against the predominance of material on African Americans as enslaved people or working in menial jobs or other stereotypical situations,’ Cornell’s Katherine Reagan has said . ‘We wanted to show a broader swath of people in everyday settings’ ‘These images are tantalising for what they show, but also what they don’t show’ Many of the images are daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, carte-de-visite photographs, albumen prints or Polaroids – relatively cheap and commercial kinds of photography available to the public in local studios A note on the rear of this image reads: ‘The best wishes from Class of ’08, Texas College, to Mrs Minnie Apperson’ Stephan and Beth Loewentheil, who donated the archive, are collectors of rare books and photography. They own two branches of the 19th Century Rare Book and Photograph Shop – one in Baltimore and one in New York Stephan has also collected early Chinese photography , and he mediated in the record-breaking $9.3m sale of a 16th-century Talmud A US civil war-era photo album the couple owned became the eight-millionth volume in Cornell University’s library when they donated it in 2014 A portrait of conjoined twins Millie and Christine", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:20:47.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
