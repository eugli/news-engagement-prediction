(WBZ-TV) \nThings have not gone well for Sandoval since singing a five-year, $95 million deal with Boston in 2014. He hit just .245 with 10 homers and 47 RBIs in his first season with the Red Sox, and played in just three games in 2016 before undergoing season-ending shoulder surgery. \nBut Boston traded Travis Shaw to Milwaukee this offseason, paving the way for Sandoval to reclaim his starting job this season. Arriving to Spring Training eight days before he has to, plus his svelte figure, are good signs of Sandoval’s commitment for the upcoming season. \nNew Red Sox ace Chris Sale also reported for duty on Thursday, joining fellow starters David Price and Rick Porcello, who reported to Fort Myers last week: Chris Sale is also working out at Fenway South today. pic.twitter.com/oqFAFIVrYt \n— Ian Browne (@IanMBrowne) February 9, 2017 \nPitchers and catchers don’t have to report until February 12, with their first workout scheduled for February 14.
