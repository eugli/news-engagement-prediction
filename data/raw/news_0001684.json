A graphic detailing the expected closures during the strike \nTalks between the RMT and LU to try and settle the bitter dispute, over up to 900 jobs cuts and the closure of all ticket offices, could continue tomorrow – leaving the four million a day users not knowing until the last moment if they will have a service for half of next week. \nThe walkout has been deliberately timed for maximum disruption; staff will walkout from 6 pm on Sunday until 10 am on the Monday, 6 February. \nThey then walkout again from 10 am on Tuesday, 7 February until 1 am on Wednesday, 8 February. \nStations will start closing – including Victoria, Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus - from 8 pm Sunday evening. February Tube strikes: what you need to know \nFrom 5.30 until 7 am on Monday, 6 February, there will be no service throughout most of Zone 1 with sections of the Victoria, Central, Piccadilly, Northern and Bakerloo lines closed. \nFrom 7 am there will only be a “very limited” service – effectively ruining the morning peak for millions of people; this will last for most of the day with stations reopening from 4 pm but again meaning huge disruption for journeys home. \nOn Tuesday, 7 February from 12 Noon there will gain be a very limited service; from 8 pm lines and stations will close. \nOn Wednesday, 8 February, there will be no service, with Zone 1 lines and stations closed, until 7 am. From then services will be “very limited” with again morning peak time travel ruined. \nAn LU spokesman said: “If the strikes go ahead there will be a significant impact on Tube journeys. \n“We will open as many stations as possible. But, for safety reasons, many stations, especially those in Zone 1, will not open at all or close at short notice.” \nThe TSSA union, representing hundreds of ticket staff, is also taking part in the Acas talks although its members are not involved in the walkout. \nLeader Manuel Cortes said talks concerning the “return to staffing and adequate safety levels to the Tube will continue tomorrow and Friday.” \nThe unions are furious with Mayor Sadiq Kahn for not reopening at least some of the central London ticket offices closed by Boris Johnson when Mayor to save cash.
