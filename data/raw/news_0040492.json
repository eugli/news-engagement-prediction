The loss of lives in the recent incidents was unnecessary and avoidable,\" said Sinha and members of the Concerned Citizens Group. \n\n\"The issue of Jammu and Kashmir is a political issue and demands a political solution,\" they said in a statement. \n\n\"The present bloodshed must come to an end, and dialogue alone will achieve this,\" it added. \n\nSinha, in December 2016, led the Concerned Citizens Group, a team of eminent members -- Wajahat Habibullah, Sushobha Barve, Bharat Bhushan and retired Air Marsal Kapil Kak, to Kashmir and held dialogue with the stakeholders. \n\nThey also released a report with recommendations for restoring peace in the valley. \n\nThe visit was aimed at finding ways to restore peace in Kashmir, which was witnessing widespread unrest and violence after the killing of militant Burhan Wani in July 2016.
