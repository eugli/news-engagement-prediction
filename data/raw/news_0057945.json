Supplied \nKelvin Tennant at The Alfred hospital with his daughter Natalie and granddaughter Imogene. \nWhile he's feeling \"really great\" despite his injuries, he said the area \"is not a safe place to be at the moment\". \nREAD MORE: \n\"I knew I was being fired at, and I just pretended to be dead so that my attacker might go away,\" he said. Justin McManus \nKelvin Tennant's son Nick Tennant and daughter Natalie Knox spoke outside The Alfred after their father's shooting. \n\"I thought I was finished, without a doubt. I thought it would be eyes shut. \n\"I was in disbelief, that's the only word I can think of. Sheer disbelief that you are enduring that.\" \nTennant has slowly had memories come back to him since the four to six .22 rounds were fired at him. \n\"I was just riding along and saw this car parked, backed up to the track, with the boot up,\" he said. \n\"It seemed to be parked in a funny spot, that's what drew my attention â€“ it was a grassy area, not where you'd normally expect to see a car backed into. \n\"As I drew level, he opened fire, started blazing away. \n\"I knew I'd been hit. I knew he'd fired something at me. \n\"But I hadn't felt the impact of the bullets.\" \nThe keen rider has no plans to return to the region, but may keep riding on other trails. He's been overwhelmed by the people who have contacted him since the incident, including former students, and plans to get back in touch with them after he's released from hospital. \n\"I want him caught,\" Tennant said of his attacker. \n\"I'm keen for him to be found for the sake of those people who ride that trail. \n\"I passed a family coming the other way (before the shooting), who I think would be the same people who rendered assistance to me. \n\"For the sake of them, I hope they catch him so that people can go and enjoy these trails. That's the main reason I want him caught.\" - Sydney Morning Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:23:32.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
