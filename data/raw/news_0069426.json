Phillip, STF Rockets' Ryan Anderson uses All-Star break to get engaged 1 / 2 Back to Gallery \nWhen the Rockets reconvened at Toyota Center on Tuesday and traded stories of how they spent their All Star break, Ryan Anderson topped every beach getaway to Mexico or Miami or trip to West Virginia or New Orleans. \nAnderson said he was \"busy on the beach,\" then added the real news. \n\"I got engaged!\" he said. \"It's great. I'm real excited about it. I got a great girl so I'm happy.\" \nMany around the country were especially happy for Anderson, knowing the story of his former fianc√©, Gia Allemand, who took her life in August 2013 after years battling depression. \nAnderson proposed to Kari Klinkenborg, successfully surprising her on an All Star break trip to Mexico. \n\"It was right after we got to Mexico because I knew I couldn't hide the secret,\" Anderson said. \"I had a little thing setup on the beach. I'm super romantic. The sun was setting. It was a great. It was a good time. It was good to do it during All Star break because we could enjoy it and relax and come back and finish the rest of the season. \n\"She was surprised. She's the hardest person to surprise I've ever experienced. Everybody in her family kept it super secret. It was great.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:59:43.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
