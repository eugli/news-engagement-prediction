Most Popular By Kyle Mizokami Feb 21, 2017 Last month, a Houthi vessel packed with explosives rammed a frigate of the Saudi Navy at high speed, killing two sailors and injuring three others. That small boat was unmanned was an unmanned drone , Defense News now reports, and this may be the first such attack by a drone boat. The attack on the Al Madinah -class frigate took place in broad daylight on January 30, in the Red Sea approximately 30 miles from the Yemeni port of Hudaydah. Three small boats approached the frigate. One got close enough to ram it, causing a large explosion. The others were \"dealt with as necessary\", according to the Saudi-led coalition intervening in Yemen's civil war.   Most Popular Video of the attack was captured by closed circuit TV camera set up in the ship's hangar. A small boat rams Al Madinah from the rear at high speed and then explodes. The exact damage done to the ship is unknown but the attack appears to damage the ship's helicopter. The use of remote-controlled weaponry is spreading quickly among even low-tech paramilitary forces such as the the Islamic State, which is using commercial, off-the-shelf quadcopter drones to drop grenades and cluster bomblets . Those types of weapons, like the remote controlled speedboats used in last month's attack, aren't completely autonomous but rely on a remote operator. Both are controlled by radio waves that can be jammed, but the target has to be aware of the threat. This is the first time anyone has seen remote-controlled suicide boats in the wild. According to Defense News the January attack is believed the first ever by remote-controlled boat. The attack follows a missile attack that heavily damaged the HSV-2 Swift , a roll-on, roll-off catamaran transport formerly leased by the U.S. Navy and operating under contract with the United Arab Emirates. In October, Houthi rebels fired anti-ship missiles on three occasions at the U.S. Navy destroyers Nitze and Mason , and Afloat Staging Base (and laser-armed ship) Ponce . No U.S. Navy ships were damaged the attacks.
