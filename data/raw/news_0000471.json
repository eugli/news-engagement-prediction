Another data (for) 10 lakh is ready. We want that this should be completed and we have today issued 13 lakh SMS and email to the persons about whom we have details,” he said. \nThe rest of the 5 lakh people would be receiving SMS and emails on Friday for clarification under the “Operation Clean Money”. \nThe Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), he said, is moving on a very fast track to ensure all untaxed are brought under the tax net. \nThe information on 18 lakh depositors is part of CBDT’s ‘Swachh Dhan Abhiyan’ (Operation Clean Money) drive that uses data analytics and taxpayer profiling to detect potential tax evasion on cash deposits post November 8 decision to junk 500 and 1,000 rupee notes. \nHe said the Income Tax Department has identified 18 lakh people who have made “suspicious” cash deposits post demonetisation. \nChandra had earlier this week stated that 10 days’ time would be given to people to reply to the e-communication, and replies can be filed by logging on to the e-filing portal of the I-T department. \nIn the initial phase, the CBDT has put on e-filing portal the data of those persons who have deposited Rs 5 lakh or more of suspicious nature and have poor tax compliance after November 8, Chandra said. \nHe said data on 18 lakh taxpayers has been uploaded on e-filing portal. These people while filing reply have to explain to the tax department the sources of deposits. \nThe deposits will be compared with the income profile, turnover and other parameters available in the income tax data bank to see if they match with tax paying profile. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:37:31.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
