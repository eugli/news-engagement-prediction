Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nThe government's childcare changes will roll the current Child Care Benefit and Child Care Rebate into one means-tested payment and abolish the annual $7500 rebate cap. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the changes were a \"very big social reform\". \n\"What we're proposing - and we're seeking the support of the Senate - is reforms that will make childcare more affordable and more available, especially for families on lower incomes,\" he said. \nSenator Xenophon, whose party's votes will be crucial for the government, said his vote was not locked in but welcomed the revamped package. \n\"I think philosophically, if you replace a supplement with increased weekly payments, then obviously that is a step in the right direction,\" he told ABC TV. \nSenator Hanson said the government was handing out a \"lot of money\" to families and payments need to be cut to reduce the national debt. \n\"We've got to rein back on our welfare payments,\" she said. \nLabor families spokeswoman Jenny Macklin said the party remained opposed to the combined package. \n\"We think the government is going to hurt millions of Australian families with these cuts,\" Ms Macklin said. \n\"These cuts will see some of the poorest families in Australia lose more money. \n\"They will have to spend either less time at home with their newborn baby or have their standard of living reduced.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:38:38.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
