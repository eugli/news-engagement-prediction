The high school’s Morgan Bowl, with its stone wall, is one of the area’s most creative football settings.\nPeople have moved on and a new, younger generation is gaining a foothold, but the town still stays together, Redding said. “Even among our businesses downtown, there’s still a neighborhood feeling.”\nHandout\nArthur Redding of Hudson\nBY THE NUMBERS\n3\nAdvertisement\nHow many bunches of fresh mint go into a batch of New City Microcreamery ’s mint chocolate chip ice cream.
