Picture: Troy Snook Manly ‘Throwing around sides of beef and handling a baby will be a contrast!’ Ryan Watson, 21, 2017 5:14pm 'I've delivered 4000 babies, but didn't deliver my own!' Steve Flood: 'I'll take my time to find the right girl!'\nON MY second day as owner at The Fairlight Butcher, my wife Roslynne came up to the shop to tell me she was pregnant.\nThe business stress suddenly rose! But whenever there was stress the baby was a distraction and vice versa. I’d use it as motivation to get things up and running.\nRoz is 38 weeks pregnant now, and we don’t know what we’re having — it’s going to be a surprise.\nWe’ve got all of the baby stuff. It’s like when you get married and you go, “Right, we’ve got to book the photographer, the venue ...” and you do all it in one go.\nWe did that with the baby — we’ve got the pram, the car seat ...\nmedia_camera Ryan Watson took over the shop in July. Picture: Troy Snook\nSoon after we found out about the pregnancy, we had to move house, so in six months we bought a business, got pregnant and moved house. It was big!\nOn Sunday we did a tour of the hospital and birthing suite at Royal North Shore where Roz works.\nWe did our anti-natal classes in Bondi with two sisters — one’s a yoga instructor and one’s a midwife. There were only two other couples in the group. It was cool and definitely a learning curve.\nThe lady went round the class and for a bit of a joke I said, “It’s a bit like wrapping up some snags in butcher’s paper” and I wrapped the doll up like that!\nThanks @johcoh05 for sharing.
