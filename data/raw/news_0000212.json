Ambassador Nikki Haley Condemns Russia’s ‘Aggressive Actions’ in Security Council Remarks by Josh Feldman | 6:41   BREAKING: US Amb. to UN Haley: \"I must condemn the aggressive actions of Russia\" in eastern Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/rj7YQURxNO \n— NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) February 2, 2017 \nNikki Haley , the new United States Ambassador to the United Nations, condemned Russia’s “aggressive actions” in her first public remarks at the U.N. Security Council today. \n“I consider it unfortunate,” Haley said, “that the occasion of my first appearance here is one in which I must condemn the aggressive actions of Russia.” \nThere have been a lot of questions over the Trump administration’s approach to Russia, given President Trump avoiding criticisms of Russia and concerns about Russian ties from administration officials like Rex Tillerson . \nBut Haley said today that wanting to better relations with Russia does not mean the U.S. should not be condemning the “dire situation in Eastern Ukraine.” \n“This escalation of violence must stop,” she continued. “The United States stands with the people of Ukraine, who have suffered for nearly three years under Russian occupation and military intervention.” \nHaley has also made it clear that sanctions against Russia will “remain in place until Russia returns control over the peninsula to Ukraine.” \nWatch above, via NBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:01:31.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
