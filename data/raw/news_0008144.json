The Wildcats won in comeback fashion, forcing the extra session and ultimately winning 90-81. \nBut before all that, one last time, we got the famous intro. \"You are looking live.\" — ESPN College BBall (@ESPNCBB) February 1, 2017 \nMusburger has been a staple of sports broadcasting for nearly 50 years, an iconic piece of CBS Sports broadcasts through the 1970s and 1980s and a recent staple of ABC and ESPN's coverage of college football after making the move in the 1990s. \nIn that career, he has called Super Bowls, college football national championships, the Indianapolis 500, Doug Flutie's Hail Mary against Miami in 1984, The Masters , college basketball national championships and got the country's football Sunday started as the host of The NFL Today . \nEveryone has their personal favorites, but here's our best attempt at compiling the very best Brent Musburger moments. \nDoug Flutie's Hail Mary vs. Miami (1984) \nMusburger had the call for several NBA Finals as a part of CBS Sports' coverage. His call of the insane finish to Game 5 in 1976 (Boston-Phoenix) from Boston is particularly memorable. \nBut so is this \"live phone interview\" with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1980. That's Brent, always resourceful and willing to go the extra mile for the people. And is that ... a rotary phone!?! \nBrent's final call for CBS (after 22 years with the company) was the 1990 Final Four. After UNLV had put the finishing touches on Duke, Musburger signed off and made his move to ABC. \nIn 2008, the rest of the ABC broadcast team shamed Brent for not knowing how to pronounce Beyonce during a game between Oklahoma and Texas Tech. \nOther great moments in cross-promotion: Brent and Kirk Herbstreit interview Eminem in the booth at Michigan-Notre Dame. \nBrent shot his shot early, calling Louisville as a sleeper team on opening weekend in 2016. But he couldn't help himself by packing a motorcycle-related dig at Bobby Petrino into the compliment. \nSome of the great individual calls from Brent's time with ABC were compiled in this supercut, starting with plenty of great \"You're Looking Live\" calls. \nAnd finally, here's Musburger's sign-off from Lexington. He didn't make the final game about himself. It was, as always, about serving the fans and calling the game. \"What a road we've traveled together.\"A legend signs off ... for the final time. https://t.co/2f59lm3tI1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T12:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T07:30:34.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
