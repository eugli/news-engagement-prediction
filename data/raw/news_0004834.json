He has attended almost all the seasons. From making an appearance with his co-star Preity Zinta to appearing on the show with Kareena twice, Saif's 'Koffee' journey has been quite entertaining. \nAnd now an Indian express report claims that Saif Ali Khan will make his appearance with his Rangoon co-star Kangana Ranaut. The report also claims that both the stars will be shooting for their episode on 3 February, while the episode will be aired a week prior to the release of Rangoon . \nBut here's what most of us are wondering - why isn't Shahid a part of the episode? According to reports, this could have to do with the fact that things aren't all that great between Kangana and Shahid.
