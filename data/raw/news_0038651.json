But on Sunday 12 February, the special toy ended up becoming lost at the airport when Thomas was waiting with his family to catch a flight to Basel in Switzerland. \nThomas was already distressed as the flight had been delayed by 90 minutes, and further upset was caused when it was realised that Horsey had been dropped – though it is suspected the toy was lost somewhere near Terminal 1, gate three of the airport. (Picture: MEN) \nThomas’ family are currently urging any holidaymakers or airport staff who may have seen his toy, which is described as being pale blue, with strings coming from his head and a soft body, to get in touch. \nAnne Kidd, Thomas’ mother, has posted images of Horsey to her social media accounts, alongside a video of Thomas visibly distraught while on holiday because he was without his toy. \nThe Kidd family hadn’t been on a plane in six years because the amount of distress it would cause Thomas. Anne used to live in Germany and very much wanted to meet up with her friends who she hadn’t seen for a long time with the whole family, including Thomas, so she risked the flight during the quiet season. (Picture: MEN) \nWhich makes losing Horsey during this time even more upsetting. \nAnne, who describes the toy as being an ‘extension’ of her son’s arm, said: ‘Thomas has had Horsey since he was born. Being autistic, he hasn’t developed usual relationships. \n‘That’s why Horsey was so very special, Thomas really had a very special relationship with Horsey. He slept on him every night and was an extension to his arm during the day.
