You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden,\" Trump told the crowd at his campaign-like rally in Florida on Saturday, critiquing Europe's refugee policies and complaining that his travel ban had suffered setbacks in court. \"Sweden, who would believe this?\"\nMore from NBC News:\nHomeland Security Memos Detail How Trump Could Detain and Deport\nMcCain Warns Suppressing Press 'Is How Dictators Get Started'\nKushner Took a Stricter Approach on Ethics Than Trump, Emails Show\nIt was unclear following the rally what could have occurred in Sweden to draw the president's attention, and the Swedish Embassy asked for clarity.\nTrump took to his Twitter account Sunday evening to explain that he was referring to a Tucker Carlson segment that appeared on Fox News Friday. In the segment, Carlson interviewed right-wing filmmaker Ami Horowitz, who had recently made a documentary about Sweden's refugee policy. The segment did not contain breaking news.\nTweet 1\nA spokesperson for the Swedish Embassy said they didn't know if Trump's tweet served as the government's official response to their request for an explanation.\n\"We have asked State Department if President Trumps' tweet is their official answer to our question earlier today. We are still awaiting an answer on that,\" the spokesperson said.\nA White House spokesperson had attempted to explain what Trump had been referring to prior to Trump's tweet.\nshow chapters What did Trump's rally really achieve? 3 Hours Ago | 02:26 \"He was talking about rising crime and recent incidents in general — not referring to a specific incident,\" White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters.\nBut the country had spent the day baffled, because the president had said \"last night\" and nothing appeared to have happened.\n\"Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound,\" Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister, wrote on Twitter while he attended the Munich Security Conference on Sunday.\nSweden's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Catarina Axelsson, told the Associated Press that the Swedish government did not know of any \"terror-linked major incidents.\" Additionally, the Associated Press reported, Sweden's Security Police had not seen any threats or responded to any attacks.\nSweden's U.S. embassy also appeared to take a jab at the president on Twitter Sunday evening, retweeting Trump's earlier justification and saying: \"We look forward to informing the US administration about Swedish immigration and integration policies.\"\nTweet 2\nTrump's remarks were not the first time his administration has referred to nonexistent terror attacks while defending his executive order restricting travel for people from seven predominantly Muslim nations.\nWhite House Counselor Kellyanne Conway invoked a \"Bowling Green massacre,\" which never occurred . Conway has since said she made a mistake. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer cited a nonexistent terror attack in Atlanta, then later claimed he meant the shooting at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida — a city more than 400 miles south of Atlanta.\nNo terrorist attack in the U.S. has actually occurred at the hands of individuals from any of the seven countries whose people Trump's first executive order barred.\nSweden, meanwhile, has not experienced a terrorist act committed by a refugee or person of the Muslim faith since December 2010, when an Iraqi-Swedish national detonated a suicide bomb.\nshow chapters Cuban vs. O'Leary: The Trump debate Friday, 17 Feb 2017 | 1:19 PM ET | 26:19 According to the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security's Crime and Safety Report on Sweden, released last May, overall crime rose 4 percent in 2015. The increase was attributed to the rise in computer fraud.
