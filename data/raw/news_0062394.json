Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images By Nicole Gallucci 2017-02-22 23:41:12 UTC \nIn case you haven't heard, it's been an especially rough week for Milo Yiannopoulos, but even in the darkest of times the man can't help but troll the world. \nFirst Yiannopoulos' book deal was dropped by Simon & Schuster after backlash surrounding some controversial pedophilia comments he made in a video, and then the notorious alt-right internet troll announced he would be resigning from his position as a senior editor at Breitbart News and starting his own \"independently-funded media venture.\" \nHowever, people have noticed something about the personal logo Milo used to head his resignation letter ... it's horrible. SEE ALSO: Scottish publisher trolls Milo Yiannopoulos in the most epic way \nYiannopoulos has managed to take four simple letters — M, I, L and O — and transform them into not only a visually unappealing logo, but a profoundly puzzling conversation topic. \nAt first glance, the logo is simple: the name MILO. But if you take a deeper look, some hidden imagery may arise. \nOnce people stared at the ~unique~ logo, the visual comparisons began flying. From a really crappy DJ logo to Nazi symbols to Human Centipede references, Twitter users began to brainstorm what exactly Milo was trying to tell the world with this visual of his name. Anybody else notice that Milo's logo is a person on all fours with their ass in the air? pic.twitter.com/bq10Dct1kd \n— The House Of WTF? (@TheHouseOfWTF) February 22, 2017 First I thought Milo’s logo looked like he was in a metal band.

Wow. You take out that circle, it's like a build-your-own-swastika kit. pic.twitter.com/9auz33gLFT \n— Mark Waid (@MarkWaid) February 22, 2017 Not even kidding, when I was 18 I was in a band that did Cream, Free and Zeppelin covers called Milo as this was pretty much our logo pic.twitter.com/IReYylFYiR \n— Adim Hales (@adimhales) February 22, 2017 On top of everything else, Milo ripped off the Hellboy logo for his pederast letterhead. https://t.co/01M5CqSUb2 \n— Andy Khouri (@andykhouri) February 21, 2017 All that's left of Milo is his discount Skrillex logo pic.twitter.com/bOI56fy3jN \n— John Hendrickson (@JohnGHendy) February 21, 2017 sorry but i’ve used angles to decipher the true spirit of the milo logo & it’s good actually pic.twitter.com/h9OYdrNGKs ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:46:07.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
