But our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground,” Mattis explained. \nThis caused a frigid exchange between Mattis and Russia’s defense minister Sergei Shoigu, after the General said that NATO needed to “negotiate from a position of strength” with Russia. \nShoigu groused at the statement, saying, “if the U.S. thinks it can negotiate from a position of strength, then talks are hopeless.” \nWhen asked to respond, Mattis gruffly retorted, “I have no need to respond to the Russian statement at all. NATO has always stood for military strength and protection of the democracies and the freedoms we intend to pass on to our children.” \nThis is especially surprising considering Trump’s continued insistence that Russia did not interfere with the election, and that he would be seeking a friendship with the country to further U.S. interests. Mattis appears to be much more suspicious and cautious about the intentions of our former global adversary. \nIn the background of all these interactions is the drama unfolding over leaks exposing communications between Trump’s campaign and Russian officials before the election. Trump’s accusations and attacks against U.S. intelligence agencies have only encouraged administration critics who are demanding investigations into the alleged election tampering.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:10:11.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
