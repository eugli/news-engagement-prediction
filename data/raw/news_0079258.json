'Grey wall of China': the town at the frontline of a looming ageing crisis Read more \nBirths rose to 17.86 million in 2016, the highest level since 2000, after the country issued new guidelines in late 2015 allowing all parents to have two children amid growing concerns over the costs of supporting an ageing population. \n“That fully met the expectations but barriers still exist and must be addressed,” Wang was quoted as saying. \n“To have a second child is the right of each family in China but affordability has become a bottleneck that undermines the decision.” \nA poll conducted by the commission in 2015 found that 60% of families surveyed were reluctant to have a second baby, largely due to financial constraints. \nChina’s birth rate, one of the world’s lowest, is fast becoming a worry for authorities rather than the achievement it was considered at a time when the government feared over-population. \nChina began implementing its controversial one-child policy in the 1970s in order to limit population growth, but authorities are now concerned that the country’s dwindling workforce will not be able to support an increasingly ageing population . \nThe policy was ended in 2015. The Communist party credited it with preventing 400m births, contributing to China’s dramatic economic takeoff since the 1980s.
