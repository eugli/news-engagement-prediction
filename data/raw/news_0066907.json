We get talkback radio and when we go home we can watch digital television, but mostly people like to yarn under that tree,\" Mr Mosby said. \nAlthough the future of what is left of the tree remains uncertain, Mr Mosby said he would like to see something done with it to remind people of its significance. \n\"I'd like to see it put in such a place that people can go and have a look at it, because it's a historic tree for this island,\" he said. \nMasig Island community members are currently working to clear the remains of the tree from the site.
