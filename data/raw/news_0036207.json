It won an Academy Award for the original song, “Can You Feel the Love Tonight,” as well as its original score by Hans Zimmer. \n“The Jungle Book” was a smash hit, earning $965.8 million worldwide after it hit theaters last April. Other Disney live-action films based on iconic properties include “Maleficent,”“Cinderella” and next year’s “Beauty and the Beast,” starring Emma Watson as Belle. \nJeff Nathanson is writing the script on the live-action “Lion King,” which is considered one of the pinnacles of Disney’s animated movies.

Billy Dee Williams played Lando in the original film, and he reprised the role in the “Star Wars Rebels” episodes “Idiot’s Array” and “Siege of Lothal.” \nNo release date has been announced yet for “The Lion King.” \nGlover is currently the creator and star of the FX show “Atlanta.” He is represented by WME. 14 Live-Action Disney Movies in the Works Based on Animated Classics, From 'Mulan' to 'Snow White' (Photos) \nDisney will be pumping out live-action versions of its animated classics for a long time to come. Here's a list of titles in the works, including the release date of the original. \nBeauty and the Beast (1991) The next live-action reboot stars Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, Josh Gad and voices such as Emma Thompson, and hits theaters onMarch 17, 2017. Disney \nThe Lion King (1994) Director Jon Favreau transplanted to Disney after proving himself a major player with Marvel's \"Iron Man.\" Then Favreau knocked \"The Jungle Book\" out of the park in spring 2016. Getty / Disney \nMaleficent Adapted from 1959's \"Sleeping Beauty,\" the movie helped energize Angelina Jolie's career and introduced an entire generation to the tale's terrifying villain. A sequel is in the works. Disney \nAladdin (1992) This whimsical and critically acclaimed journey catapulted Robin Williams into four-quadrant comedy stardom thanks to his take on the genie in Aladdin’s lamp. Now the colorful and gritty director Guy Ritchie will try his hand at a reboot. Disney \nMulan (1998) This is a particularly anticipated title, already slated for release on November 2, 2018. The title character has not yet been cast (and there's plenty of controversy about that). It has a script by Elizabeth Martin and Lauren Hynek. Disney \nThe Little Mermaid (1985) \"Mermaid\" is arguably one of the most popular and profitable movies in Disney's vault. The live version has already drafted songwriter Alan Menken and \"Hamilton\" superstar Lin-Manuel Miranda. Getty Images \nCruella Extracted from the famous villainess of 1961’s “One Hundred and One Dalmatians,” this origin story of a woman who declares open season on purebred puppies-- Cruella DeVil -- is set to star Emma Stone. The reigning live-action Cruella is Glenn Close, who herself starred in two live-action adaptations. Getty Images \nJames and the Giant Peach (1996) In one of the more interesting adaptations, this beloved Roald Dahl book became a quirky claymation hit for Disney in 1996 with director Henry Selick. Now, heavy dramatist director Sam Mendes will take a stab at the story. Getty Images \nRose Red This one is trippy (no pun over producer Tripp Vinson), but promising creatively. In the German fairy tale, Rose Red is Snow White's sister. Disney and Vinson are collaborating on introducing the world to the sibling of the famous apple-loving princess. Disney released the original \"Snow White\" in 1937. Disney \nSnow White (1937) Forget her sister -- the original baddest chick in the Disney animated kingdom is coming back for her own standalone film. It was announced at the end of October 2016. Disney \nPeter Pan Neverland will get a practical set if Disney has its way updating the 1953 animated film. Disney \nThe Jungle Book 2 This is a no-brainer follow-up to Favreau's hit from spring 2006, based on the animated classic released in 1967. Disney \nDumbo (1941) In another promising but visually daunting prospect, Tim Burton is developing \"Dumbo,\" about the gentle (and a tad neurotic) performing elephant. Getty Images \nOliver Twist While Disney never formally made a direct animated take on Charles Dickens' beloved orphan, they did release the adorable 1988 \"Oliver and Company,\" inspired by Dickens' tale but told with animals. They also made a small-screen live-action version in 1997 with Richard Dreyfuss.
