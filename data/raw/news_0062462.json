The much-anticipated superhero flick is slated to debut the first week of March, and hype for the flick continues to escalate thanks to the press’ praise. The film will introduce fans to a different sort of blockbuster which favors gritty character growth over bombastic superhero battles. So, of course, the soundtrack for Logan might sound a bit different than you may think. \nWhen the first trailer for Logan debuted, it made headlines for its use of “Hurt” by Johnny Cash. Now, a track list for the full Logan soundtrack has hit the Internet via Amazon , and the lengthy album has some fairly spoiler-ish names attached. So, you’ve been warned. \nYou can check out the track list below: \n1. Main Titles5. Alternate Route to Mexico6. That’s Not a Choo-Choo7. X-2415. You Can’t Break the Mould16. Up to Eden21. Don’t Be What They Made You22. Eternum – Laura’s Theme23. Logan’s Limo24. Loco Logan25. Logan Drives \nFrom the track titles alone, fans can get a sense of the film’s plot trajectory. For instance, it seems Logan’s fight in the woods will come closer to the film’s end, and there are other points of interest. Two tracks are labeled X-24, and fans are curious about the titling. Many Marvel fans know Laura Kinney will debut in the film, and the young girl goes by the moniker X-23 in the comics. As a clone of Wolverine, the character has very similar mutations to her predecessor, so the use of X-24 on the track listing has some fans understandably curious. \nAre you excited to see Logan ? Let us know how hyped you are with our anticipation rankings ! Currently, the film is #6 on our site! \nLogan takes place in the year 2029, where mutant births have become extremely rare. The defenders of mutant kind, the X-Men , are long gone, and the only remains of them are an old and struggling Charles Xavier and a weary Logan. Logan's vaunted healing factor has slowed, and at times doesn't seem to work at all. When a young mutant needs his help, Logan has to unsheathe his claws once more. His job isn't over yet. \nLogan stars Hugh Jackman (Logan), Boyd Holbrook (Donald Pierce), Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier), Dafne Keen (Laura Kinney/X-23), Doris Morgado (Maria), Stephen Merchant (Caliban), Elizabeth Rodriguez (Gabriela), and Richard E. Grant (Dr. Zander Rice). James Mangold is directing and helped on the screenplay along with Scott Frank and Michael Green.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:41:24.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
