\nProsecutors charge the Iraqi men with “abuse of a defenceless person and rape in a very humiliating and agonising way for the victim.” Getty Images 2 Austrian police on duty over the New Year (stock) \nOne of the men is alleged to have taken a selfie’ with the woman after her alleged ordeal. \nAt the opening of the trial on Tuesday the Austrian court heard how the woman identified as Sabine K. was “blind drunk” when she went with the men to an apartment. \nMost of them deny the charges but DNA proved that sperm from six of them was found in or on her body. \nThe court heard how the woman arrived in Vienna on December 28 2015 to spend the New Year with a female friend in the city . \nShortly before midnight on December 31 they wandered into the city centre to join the crowds celebrating the arrival of 2016 and at 2am were seen drinking in a bar-restaurant called Cactus. \nAt 3am the friend of Sabine noticed she was no longer there and was told by another patron that the men she had been talking with had “taken her away.” \nThe defendants, aged between 22 and 45, all arrived in Austria between May and December 2015 via the Balkan route. \nAt the time of the attack, five of them had cemented their right to stay, the applications of the other four were still pending. \nJudge Petra Poschalko heard how the woman was taken by four of them to an apartment in Vienna’s Rustenschacher Allee where five other men were waiting. \nSabine later said she found herself naked on a double bed being assaulted by the men one after the other. \nEvidence as heard that said she was assaulted in the dark so she could not identify the men, according to her lawyer Karina Fehringer. \nAfter the alleged attacks, which went on for several hours, the victim needed in-patient treatment at a trauma clinic. \nShe is now under psychiatric care for post traumatic stress disorder. \nShe is said to have had another breakdown at the weekend and was too fragile to be in court to face her attackers. \nOnly one man, Mohamed Al-A., 31, admitted his role in the rapes and he sobbed in court and said he was “really drunk” on vodka at the time. \nAnd he further admitted: “This act is a crime in Iraq.” Related Stories Sudanese migrant granted asylum in the UK raped a terrified tourist at London railway station 'MURDERED BY A MIGRANT' Teen daughter of senior EU official who

back to the apartment. \nThe other defendants – Hader Al-A., Mustafa Al-J., Nael Al-J., Marwan Al-J. und Sabah Al-J. – lay in wait for her there. \nMedical experts testified she was raped multiple times and sodomised. \nThe victim said she yelled at them, in German: “No, I don’t want this.” Then in English: “Listen to me, just a little bit.” \nHer attackers are said to have only conversed only in Arabic. \nAfter it was over Mohammed Al-. escorted her to a toilet in the flat where he took a selfie with her on his mobile phone. Getty Images 2 The alleged attack took place on New Year’s Eve \nLater he and Alaa Al-J. escorted her to a nearby tram stop where they tried to stem her sobbing by saying in English: “Don’t cry.” \nAfter she went to police a tracking app on her mobile phone led officers to the rape scene. \nThe app showed that her ordeal lasted from 4.20am to 6.20am on January 1 2016. \nThe court heard that with the exception of the man who confessed, none of the others feel guilty. \nSeveral denied rape in the face of the DNA evidence. \nOne man claimed that the woman had been “offered” to them by relatives: another that she was a willing participant in whatever took place. \nJudge Poaschalko seemed visibly angered at the shifts in their stories throughout Tuesday’s hearing. \nThe court resumes again on Thursday and the defendants have been warned they face up to 15 years each in jail if convicted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:32:40.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
