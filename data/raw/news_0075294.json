Who uses it more than I do,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump said. — Michael Tackett (@tackettdc) February 24, 2017 \nAnd then he got threatening. x \nTrump on the media: \"It doesn't represent the people, it never will represent the people and we're going to do something about it.\" — Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) February 24, 2017 \nTrump declared that the fake, phony news are making up sources who they won't name but are anonymous but are made up. Seriously. Trump said that the Washington Post made up sources on the Michael Flynn story. The story that the White House confirmed and fired Flynn over. Apparently, Trump has a teeny, tiny memory. x \nThe man who pretended to be \"John Miller\" for years is complaining about people not going on the record. — Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) February 24, 2017 \nThis makes PPP's latest polling so timely. Last week Trump declared that the news media was the 'enemy of the American people' but we find that only 35% of voters believe that, to 53% who say that isn't the case. By a 48/44 spread they say it is actually Trump who is the greater threat to the American people than the media. We asked voters who they thought had more credibility between Trump and each of the outlets he singled out for attack last week, and Trump loses out to every one of them by double digits. \nBut the crowd at CPAC sure ate it up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:30:03.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
