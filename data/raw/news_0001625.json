Canada is looking to go down in the record books for the highest number of snow angels flapping their wings at the same time. \nBig White Ski Resort in Kelowna is one of 100 ski hills banding together to try and break the Guinness World Record. \nIn order to take the title, 15,851 people need to take part. \n“This is the second year the Canadian Ski Patrol has attempted to break the snow angel record, with a strong turn-out in 2016,” Big White communications manager Natalia Jastrzab said in a news release. “Last year, Big White Ski Resort was buzzing with excitement when it hosted over 300 snow-loving participants for this record-breaking attempt.” \nAll ages are being encouraged to come out and take part in the free event. Participants need to meet at the Big White Telus Park no later than 9:45 a.m. \nThe angels hit the snow at exactly 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
