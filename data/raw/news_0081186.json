As of press time, Minaj has not hopped on wax to strike back, but we imagine she's in the studio right now tweaking the mix to be just right. \nAll eyes are on Nicki at the moment, and it's really a make-or-break moment for the MC's career. Since Remy Ma jumped on Nas's classic \"Ether\" instrumental for \"shETHER,\" we tried to decided which classic diss beat would be great for a flow like Nicki's. There are a few options without a doubt. \nFlip through the gallery above to see our picks for Nicki's diss track instrumentals, and let us know what you think in the comments. Do y'all think Nicki is going to respond to Remy? \n(Photo Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images) < class=\"robots-nocontent\" rel=\"\"> Feb 28, 2017 at 09:11am 306 Views Bryan Bedder/Getty Images \n\"The Bridge Is Over\" - Boogie Down Productions \nUsing KRS-One 's classic instrumental would showcase how truly steeped Nicki Minaj is in New York hip-hop history, something Remy Ma would not be happy to admit. The only issue here is that KRS and Remy are both from The Bronx, and KRS disses Queens on this classic track, which is Nicki's part of town. This response track could be easy to retort. + 1 Al Pereira/Getty Images \n\"Hit Em Up\" - Tupac \nThis would get people incredibly fired up, and perhaps Nicki could use some of the lyrical themes Tupac laid out in the original in her remix response. \n\"That's why I f*ucked your husband, you fat...\" \nTurning Remy's accusation of infidelity against her would be legendary. The only question is - has Nicki had sex with Papoose ? Does it matter? + 1 \n\"Takeover\" - Jay Z (Prod. Kanye West ) \nA Jay-Kanye classic - Hov laid the groundwork in his verses on how to slay enemies left and right, focusing on the stats. Nicki's all about preaching her supremacy with hits, so perhaps she could borrow Jay's handiwork to turn that against Remy, outlining exactly why the Bronx MC is a flop. \nThe only issue with \"Takeover\" is that we all know how that story ended... \"*FUCK JAY Z*\" + 1 \n\"False Prophets\" - J. Cole \nThe beautiful thing about J. Cole's \"False Prophets\" is that it's a Kanye West diss track, cloaked in genuine concern for another person's well being. There's nothing like a little condescension to get one fighter in the power seat. Perhaps Nicki could use this relaxed instrumental, and let the world know that \"shETHER\" was really just Remy Ma 's cry for help. Will we heed the call? + 1 Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \n\"Back 2 Back\" - Drake \nThis would just be too good. After all Meek has pulled on Nicki, there would be no greater satisfaction than to slay Meek and Remy both on one track, bringing back the instrumental that likely traumatized the Philly rapper. This type of beat would be a comfort zone for Minaj, who could easily navigate the \"Back 2 Back\" drums to bring out the optimal bounce and sting. \nAnd let's be honest, beef is about the views. How hard would the Internet blow up if Nicki remixed this track? The most hard. \nNicki, make it happen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:28:43.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
