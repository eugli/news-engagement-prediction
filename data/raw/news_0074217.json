I promise that if I get strong support, I will get more allocation to develop the district,\" he added. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T14:29:07.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
