Robots are currently used in surgery Credit: AP \nIt argues that public services should become more flexible by embracing an Uber-style \"gig\" economy with workers supporting themselves through a variety of flexible jobs acquired through online platforms. \nSuch \"contingent labour\" platforms, it says, could suit hospitals and schools as an alternative to traditional agency models, as well as organisations which experience seasonal peaks in demand such as HMRC at the end of the tax year. \nAlexander Hitchcock, the report's co-author, said: \"Such a rapid advance in the use of technology may seem controversial, and any job losses must be handled sensitively. \n\"But the result would be public services that are better, safer, smarter and more affordable.\" Last updated Sun 5 Feb 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:51:45.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
