Von Bergen , an elder at Zion Lutheran Church in Bethalto, charged in Madison County Circuit Court in connection with hidden cameras found at the church on Christmas Eve. \nBETHALTO • New evidence has been found, and charges added, against a former elder accused of hiding cameras at Zion Lutheran Church here, Madison County prosecutors said Thursday. \nProsecutors said that they added 21 charges against David L. Von Bergen, 59, of Alton. Charges say Von Bergen produced child pornography by filming two girls, ages 4 and 9. They say he also made unauthorized video recordings of four boys and girls ranging in age from 4 to 15, three adult women and one adult man. They say that two adult women were recorded in the bathroom. \nIn all, Von Bergen faces six counts of production of child pornography, four counts of possession of child pornography and 11 counts of unauthorized video recording. \nVon Bergen was originally charged in January 2016 with a felony conspiracy charge, two felony counts of unauthorized video recording and one misdemeanor count of the same charge. \nProsecutors said at the time that at least one minor had been recorded in a changing area, and that between June and December of 2015, Von Bergen made recordings with cameras hidden in several places in the church. While Von Bergen had been attempting to retrieve the cameras that December, he was confronted by then-pastor Kale Hanson, 36, of Bethalto, who agreed to get rid of the evidence by destroying the camera memory cards, prosecutors said. \nA felony count of conspiracy against Hanson is pending. \nA statement from Madison County State’s Attorney Thomas Gibbons Thursday said that the new charges were added after more than a year's work by prosecutors, Bethalto police and Illinois State Police forensics experts. \n“There are no words to express the outrage and disbelief at the actions of the Defendant alleged in these charges. The extraordinary violation of the privacy and peace of these victims in their place of worship must be dealt with in the most serious terms,” Gibbons' statement says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:11:25.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
