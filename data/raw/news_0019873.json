First up, defending champions Islamabad United get the ball rolling against the Lahore Qalandars at 3.30 p.m, hoping to put aside the off-field controversy behind them. Just a day after the tournament opener against Peshawar Zalmi, news filtered in that two of their players - Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif were provisionally suspended and sent back home by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), after the two were found to be in contact with a suspicious people from a match-fixing syndicate. The PCB suspended the two under its Anti-Corruption Code as part of an ongoing investigation into an international syndicate which was believed to be attempting to corrupt the PSL. It is against this backdrop that Misbah-ul-Haq's men step on the field at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. The champions already have one win under their belt, against the Zalmis, coming through a delayed and rain-affected game by seven wickets. Another win will make it two from two and give them a good cushion, going into the future games, both in Dubai and Sharjah. On the other hand, the Lahore Qalandars will look to hit the ground running after a narrow loss to Quetta Gladiators, on Friday night. New Zealand ace Brendon McCullum, playing for the first time in the PSL, will be asking more from his men, who had almost aced the chase before being grounded by the Quetta slow bowlers. The second game of the evening pits Karachi Kings against the Quetta Gladiators and they too would be desperately trying to get on the board after going down to Peshawar Zalmi on Friday night. Quetta, meanwhile, nicked that thrilling win over Lahore and like, Islamabad, will be hoping for two from two.
