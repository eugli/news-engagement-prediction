It wasn’t like when I was at school I thought, 'Oh, I’m going to be this big career girl'. Being a mummy is definitely my most favourite job of all, without a shadow of a doubt.\" She also spoke about how she juggled a hectic career while raising three children, saying: \"I have the same issues as the next person, but I do feel very lucky that I’ve been blessed with three lovely children and that I look forward to going to work, because I know a lot of people don’t feel like that. If I’m going to get up and leave the kids in the morning then it has to be for something that I care about, or feel passionately about – and I’m lucky to be able to do that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:14:16.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
