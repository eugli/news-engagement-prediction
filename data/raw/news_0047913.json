(Photo: Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW ORLEANS – The oohs and aahs in the Smoothie King Center said it all. \nGlenn Robinson III, thanks to a perfect score dunk in the final round of the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, was the winner. \nThe Indiana Pacers shooting guard ran from the right and soared up and over his teammate, Paul George, grabbing the ball on the way and floating long enough to clear the Pacers mascot and a dancer too. His reverse slam, with his head grazing the rim along the way, was enough to win the event that, while entertaining, was nowhere near electric as last year’s legendary affair. \nRobinson III beat the Phoenix Suns’ Derrick Jones Jr. in the final round, while also taking out the Los Angeles Clippers’ DeAndre Jordan and the Orlando Magic’s Aaron Gordon along the way.
