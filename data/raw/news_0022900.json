As Leighton, 30, prepares to star in Fox's Making History , she caught up with Rogue about making the transition from the cult classic drama to a brand new series. \n\"I think I'm different,\" she explained, adding, \"I started Gossip Girl 10 years ago when I was 20, and I'm 30 now. I loved doing it, and now I'm doing something else that I love, and something new that's a little bit more my taste as a 30 year old, something I've grown into.\" Photos \nLeighton Meester's 10 Best Looks Ever on Gossip Girl Rogue Magazine \n\"I feel so lucky that I can have such amazing fans and they either grew up with [the show] or they're growing up with it now. I've also heard people say, â€˜Oh we watch that as a throwback,\" Meester recalled. \nFor six seasons between 2007-2012, Leighton starred opposite Blake Lively in The CW show about fashionably-clad socialites living on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Now, the celeb will take shed Gossip Girl 's signature headbands and bad boy romances for a role as a time-traveling colonial woman learning about feminism through the decades. \nHer decision to sign on for the project was not an easy one, given motherhood. \"When I went into [the show], and when I decided that I wanted to work consistently on something, I had criteria. I read other [scripts] too, but this was just the one. It was love at first sight,\" Leighton dished.

I worked with awesome people when I released my first album in 2014. I'm hoping to do it again.\" \nAs for what fans can expect from Meester's return to music, she explained, \"I'm writing a bit about my current state of mind, which brings me to a happier place, but I still find a lot of inspiration from past experiences, and that leads to some more melancholy that I just can't escape.\" TAGS/ Leighton Meester , Gossip Girl , Magazines , Interviews  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:12:57.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
