Ex-cop Arthur Lascanas who used to work for Phillipine president Rodrigo Duterte has recounted how the leader paid people to kill.

Former police officer Arthur Lascanas broke down at a press conference recounting his time as a hired killed.

The evidence of the former police officer may be crucial in the probe into the death squads which is underway now.

Mr Duterte has been accused of paying people to kill criminals and opponents when he was mayor. \nMr Lascanas' comments came after he denied to a Senate hearing last year that he had been involved in any extra-judicial killings in Davao. \nHe testified at the inquiry last October after he was implicated by another witness, Edgar Matobato, a former militiaman who said Mr Duterte ordered him and others to kill criminals in gangland-style assaults that left hundreds of people dead. \nBreaking into tears at one point, Mr Lascanas said he was speaking up because he was bothered by his conscience, including his role in the deaths of his two brothers, whom he ordered killed because they were drug users. \n\"I had my own two brothers killed. Even if I end up dead, I'm content because I've fulfilled my promise to the lord to make a public confession,\" he said.

Close Duterte says he could bring back martial law UP NEXT VIDEO Duterte says he could bring back martial law \n\"We are of course extremely concerned about possible reprisals upon [whistleblowers] because the mayor is now president of the country,\" Mr Gascon said, while encouraging more people to come forward. \nThe Philippines' main witness protection scheme is run by the justice department, which falls under the president's authority. \nWith Mr Duterte in charge the rights commission has \"encountered more and more witnesses and victims who are unwilling to approach the whistleblower program,\" Mr Gascon said. \nThe commission has tried to organise alternative safeguards despite limited resources but \"our small witness protection program is currently overbooked,\" he added. \nNewsbreak â€“ February 22 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:45:08.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
