This basic strengthening will indirectly build a more sustainable company in the future,\" he added. \nOn the FGV shares, Mohd Isa said the price at present is much lower when compared to the listing due to the influence of weak market sentiment, resulting from the actions of certain parties politicising issues related to the company. \n\"The issues caused FGV shares to become unstable compared to other plantation companies in Malaysia,\" he added. \nHe said FGV was also often the focus of certain parties as it had ties to the Federal Land Development Authority (Felda) with both chaired by him previously. \n\"It is still the perception of the community that FGV is a company under Felda. Misunderstandings frequently happened in connecting FGV with any activities undertaken by Felda. \n\"This perception caused Felda's issues to be related to the performance of FGV,\" he added. \nMohd Isa said it was not easy for FGV to reach the level it had now. But, the company was constantly the target of certain parties with a negative mindset and always looking for faults to be used for their own self-interest. \n\"This is unfair to FGV and also to its shareholders,\" he added. \nHe said although the perception was hard to overcome fully, it was still important for FGV to always enhance the market's awareness and of the public, that the company was public-listed and managed professionally according to the laws of the land. \n\"FGV is committed to good corporate governance in its operations. We will ensure that every plan and business decision is made in a transparent manner and understood by shareholders and stakeholders,\" Isa added. \nHe said the appointment of Shahrir Abdul Samad as Felda chairperson would in a way help change the public's perception, apart from assisting to differentiate between the two entities. \nFocus on improving operations in stages \nMeanwhile, Mohd Isa said in in line with his role as FGV chairperson, he would focus more on improving the company's operations this year in stages, starting from the grassroots. \n\"I will go more frequently to the plantations and plants to meet staff and obtain their feedback. To me, this is important, as they have been FGV's backbone for a long time. \n\"I am of the opinion that if the problems at the grassroots can be resolved quickly and their voices heard, it would directly help raise morale, and move them to work harder,\" he added. \nHe said the staff at the grassroots need to be appreciated as they had vast experience, having been with the company for a long time. \n\"For sure they have suggestions and views to be shared with the management,\" Isa added. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T09:47:37.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
