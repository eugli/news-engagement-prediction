The two-day show is a unique combination of aerial demonstrations, military aircraft ground displays, exhibits, and attractions. In 2011 more than 200,000 people were estimated to have attended. In 2013, the event was canceled due to federal budget cuts. Thankfully, it returned in 2014. The theme in 2016 is \"75 Years of Airpower.\" \nSee photos of Luke Days. When is the Luke Days event? \nApril 2 and 3, 2016 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Gates open at 9 a.m. and close at 5 p.m. Scheduled air shows begin at 11 a.m. \nCheck back in 2017 for the 2018 event dates. Where is it? \nIt can be a little complicated getting to the event, since this is a secure, operational Air Force Base. Handicapped and parking pass holders will be able to park on the base. Entry for those cars will be at the North Gate on Litchfield Road. There is a limited number of handicapped parking spots, so if the lot is full when you get there, Parking Lot B with the shuttle is your second option. \ncontinue reading below our video Long-Haul Flight Survival Tips \nAll others will park in off-property lots. There is a $10 charge to park. You can either walk or take a shuttle to and from the event. Walkers will park in Parking Lot A (from the Loop 101, exit on Glendale Ave. and drive west towards Litchfield Road). Those wanting to park and shuttle will park in Parking Lot B (from the Loop 101 exit at Olive Ave, drive west to Litchfield Road, turn left (south). \nThere will be some street closures in the area -- it will be a very busy place! Leave extra time to get there and be patient. More details about parking and restrictions are outlined online. \nThe Arizona Department of Transportation usually provides detailed motorist information, including any travel or road restrictions, for this event. Call 5-1-1, then *7. The call is free. How do I get tickets and how much are they? \nThere are no tickets. This is a free admission event for everyone and it's a unique family activity. VIP tickets, which include tent, table, chairs, private restrooms, food, drink throughout the day, and parking pass, are available to purchase in advance online. What else should I know about Luke Days? \nThe 2016 Luke Days \"75 Years of Airpower\" open house will feature several exciting acts and dozens of static displays. The headlining act, the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, will be performing both Saturday and Sunday along with other aerial performance teams. Airmen who carry out the Luke mission of \"Training the World's Greatest F-35 and F-16 Pilots\" will be in attendance. \nAlthough more than 100,000 people attend each day of Luke Days, there's plenty of room for everyone. Chairs are permitted this year. If you have young children, bring a stroller or wagon for them. You can bring bottled water. Leave the pets at home. No coolers or backpacks are allowed. No toys that resemble weapons. No bicycles or skateboards. \nChildren love Luke Days. When your kids start to get a little bored you can take them to visit the kids' zone. Of course, there are also many military airplanes on the ground that they can walk right up to . In some cases, they can get inside. Those static displays are free. \nBring your binoculars, and bring the camera. Dress in layers -- it can be cold in the morning even if it warms up later in the afternoon . For most of the shows, you'll be looking up, so there's little reason to try to get a position in front. Be prepared with ear protection, since it can get loud. I recommend buying a package of those foam, disposable ear plugs from any pharmacy. That should be enough for the whole family. With all that looking up at the sky, don't forget the sunscreen! What if I have more questions? \nFor more information, visit Luke Days online . \nAll dates, times, prices and offerings are subject to change without notice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:28:45.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
