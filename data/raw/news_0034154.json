Rayner’s son is now selling the red phone with a Nazi party symbol and Hitler’s name engraved on the back. \nThe phone is estimated at $200,000 to $300,000 and Panagopulos says bidding will start at $100,000 this weekend. The Nazi party symbol and Hitler’s name is engraved at the back of the phone. (AFP) \nPanagopulos considers the phone a “weapon of mass destruction,” noting that the orders Hitler gave over the phone took many lives. \nHe says the seller and auction house hope it ends up in a museum, where people who see it “really understand what extreme fascist thinking can bring about.” The device was found in Hitler's bunker after the defeat of Nazi Germany. (AFP) \nAccording to an online catalogue, the auction house says the handset of the phone must be rotated almost 60 degrees before it can be lifted out of its cradle. \nThis feature kept the handset from shaking loose while being transported. The phone was used in vehicles and trains as well as Hitler’s field headquarters. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T15:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:03.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
