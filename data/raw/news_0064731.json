INQUIRER FILE PHOTO / NINO JESUS ORBETA \nVice President Leni Robredo on Tuesday said the Liberal Party (LP) is against the reimposition of the death penalty, but it would not sanction its members who would vote for it. \nRobredo was a resource person in the deliberations on the participatory governance and grassroots budgeting bills pending before the House people participation committee. She authored the people empowerment bill during her stint as Camarines Sur congresswoman in the 16th Congress. \nIn an interview with reporters, Robredo said the Liberal Party has released its position against House Bill 4727 seeking to reimpose the death penalty.

READ: House leadership hit for railroading death penalty bill \nMeanwhile, the death penalty bill in the Senate hit a gridlock after senators centered on the country’s obligations to the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which under the Second Optional Protocol states that “Each State Party shall take all necessary measures to abolish the death penalty within its jurisdiction. \nThe vote on the bill under second reading at the House of Representatives is scheduled on Feb. 28, after barely a month of plenary debates.
