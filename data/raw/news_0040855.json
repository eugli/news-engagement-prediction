Festival The ecentric dramedy, set in an Hungarian slaughterhouse, beat out favorite 'The Other Side of Hope,' which won Aki Kaurismaki Berlin's best director honor. \nOn Body and Soul , a romantic dramedy from Hungarian filmmaker Ildiko Enyedi is the surprise winner of the Golden Bear for best film at the 2017 Berlin International Film Festival. \nAn idiosyncratic love story about two lonely slaughterhouse employees who go to absurd lengths in their pursuit of one another, On Body and Soul also picked up a trio of awards from Berlin's independent juries, including the best film honor from the best film awards from the association of international film critics (FIPRESCI). \nFor Enyedi is the fulfillment of the promise shown with her debut, My Twentieth Century , which won Cannes' Camera d'Or prize for best first feature back in 1989. \nVeteran Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki, who many had tipped for the top prize in Berlin this year, took home the Silver Bear for best director for The Other Side of Hope , a heartwarming tale of a Syrian refugee who travels to Finland to seek asylum. \nAgnieszka Holland's Polish murder mystery Spoor , another supposed front-runner for the Golden Bear, had to make due with the Alfred Bauer Prize, named after the founder of the Berlin Film Festival, which honors the best European title in competition. \nAlain Gomis' Felicite , a raw and realistic portrait of a singer in the Democratic Republic of Congo, won the Jury Prize. \nThe Berlin international jury, headed by Elle director Paul Verhoeven, also surprised the crowd at the Berlinale Palast Saturday night with its picks for best actor and actress. While newcomer Daniela Vega, the transgender star of Sebastian Lelio's Chilean drama A Fantastic Woman , looked to be a shoo-in for the best actress Silver Bear, the prize instead went to Kim Min-hee for her role as a talented actress who taking a break from her screen career to pursue an affair with an older, married filmmaker in On the Beach at Night Alone from South Korean auteur Hong Sang-soo. \nSimilarly, critically-acclaimed performances by the likes of Steve Coogan (in Oren Moverman's The Dinner ), Mircea Postelnicu (in Calin Peter Netzer's Ana, mon Amour ) and Sherwan Haji as the refugee in Kaurismaki's The Other Side of Hope , were snubbed by the jury in the best actor category. The Silver Bear went to Germany's Georg Friedrich for Bright Nights , in which he plays an emotionally closed-off father taking his sullen teenage son on a road trip to Norway. \nA Fantastic Woman did pick up the Silver Bear for best screenplay, for writers Sebastian Lelio and Gonzalo Maza; and the Silver Bear for extraordinary artistic achievement went to editor Dana Bunescu for the elegant out-of-sequence work on Ana, Mon Amour . \nThe inaugural Glashutte Original Documentary Award went to Ghost Hunting from Palestinian director Raed Andoni, which recreates a notorious Israeli interrogation centre to examine the rarely-documented trauma experienced by former Palestinian prisoners. \nPresenting the documentary honor, Oscar-winning documentarian Laura Poitras used the opportunity to take a swipe at President Donald Trump. \n\"The President of the United States yesterday called the press the enemy of the people,\" Poitras said. \"We documentarians are here to say we are the enemies of nationalism and exclusion.\" \nThe best first feature award went to Carla Simonâ€™s Estiu 1993 , while Cidade Pequena from director Diogo Costa Amarante won the Golden Bear for best short film.
