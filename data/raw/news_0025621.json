Which beckons the question; who should be crowned the coveted player of the season? \nDiego Costa has been bagging a shitload of goals, Eden Hazard has rediscovered his scintillating form, not to mention David Luiz becoming a reliable player in the heart of their defence. \nBut it's the exploits from summer signing N'Golo Kante which is garnering wide acclaim including that of former Gunners legend Paul Merson who believes the diminutive Frenchman warrants the gong. \n\"Chelsea have plenty of candidates for the award, but Footballer of the Year, for me, should go to N'Golo Kante.\" He wrote in the Daily Star . \n\"He has made such a difference to them and it's no coincidence that Leicester won the title with him and are now struggling.\" (Conte and Kante share a warm embrace on the pitch.) \nIt appears Kante will win back-to-back league titles with different sides following the Foxes incredible triumph last season. Very impressive while highlighting his importance in the engine room of the pitch. \n\"To help two different teams win the title in successive seasons, which seems pretty likely at the moment, is a big achievement.\" \n\"I don't think Chelsea have had anyone like him since Claude Makelele. He's everywhere.\" \nTo be honest, it's hard to disagree with him despite wanting to. What do you make of his call? Right decision? Sound off in the comments section below.
