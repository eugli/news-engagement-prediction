The Japanese manufacturer will launch the crossover WR-V by the middle of next month. The WR-V (short for Winsome Runabout Vehicle) will go up against the Hyundai i20 Active, Volkswagen Cross Polo, Toyota Etios Cross and the Fiat Avventura Cross.\nFirst unveiled at the 2016 Sao Paulo Motor Show, the WR-V crossover was codenamed 2FM under development. Unlike the other hatchback-based crossovers in the market, the WR-V looks more of an SUV rather than a pumped up hatchback. It carries an aggressive stance with tall bonnet and a high ground clearance. The crossover is quite masculine and suits the rugged appearance of the crossover which moves it away from the Jazz hatchback. It has the new Honda signature thick chrome slat as the grille. The square-ish headlamps are swept back like the BR-V with integrated LED daytime running lamps with faux silver skid plate integrated into the black bumper cladding.\nOn the inside, the interior remains fairly similar to the Jazz hatchback to keep costs in check. The dashboard and instrument cluster is to be carried forward from the Jazz and so are the distinct ‘magic seats’. There will be a touchscreen infotainment system dominating the centre dash, with a revised upholstery.\nWhen launched in India, the WR-V will borrow the engines fitted in the Jazz. So, the petrol will be the 1.2-litre i-VTEC making 87bhp while the diesel version will get the 1.5-litre i-DTEC motor putting out 98bhp. Transmission options will include a five-speed manual and a CVT for the petrol and a six-speed manual for the diesel.\nThe car has been spotted at a manufacturer’s Tapukara facility in Rajasthan and at dealer’s stockyard in Kerala already. Expected prices for the WR-V is between Rs 5.80 – 12 lakh which means it will also be the competing with and the Ford EcoSport. Stay tuned to CarWale for all the developments on the new Honda WR-V.", "external_links": ["https://imgd3.aeplcdn.com/600x337/cw/ec/27226/Honda-WRV-Exterior-91207.jpg?wm=0", "https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/642x361/cw/ec/27226/Honda-WRV-Exterior-91206.jpg?wm=0"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:45:06.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
