People reports he then joined Missouri Gov. Eric Robert Greitens in helping to clear brush from the tombstones as part of a volunteer event in response to the attack.\n“On Monday morning America awoke to discover that nearly 200 tombstones were toppled in a nearby Jewish graveyard,” Pence said during his remarks. “Speaking just yesterday, President Trump called this a horrible and painful act. And so it was. That along with other recent threats to the Jewish community centers around the country. He declared it all a sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.\"\n\"We condemn this vile act of vandalism and those who perpetuate it in the strongest possible terms,\" he continued.\nThe vice president later took to Twitter to double-down on his remarks, again stating that acts of prejudice, violence, and anti-Semitism have no place in the United States. (Many of his critics were quick to point out this statement is in stark contrast to his opposition to LGBTQ+ rights, as well as the roll back on protections for transgender students that the Trump administration approved on Wednesday.) He also voiced his support for Missouri for \"inspiring the nation\" with their response to the attacks.\nThere's no place in America for hatred or acts of prejudice, violence, or anti-semitism. https://t.co/Flbm88l1Us\n— Vice President Pence (@VP) February 22, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below MO's people are inspiring the nation w/ their compassion for the Jewish community. Thank you for showing the world what America is all about pic.twitter.com/PWTFLGqqz0\n— Vice President Pence (@VP) February 22, 2017 In light of President Donald Trump's belated condemnation of anti-Semitism , many Jewish groups viewed Pence's visit to the Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery as an important gesture from the current administration. Most notably, while the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect absolutely obliterated Trump for his delayed response to the vandalizing earlier this week, they were quick to praise Pence for his visit.\n\"Vice President Pence proved to be the ultimate mensch by visiting, and even cleaning, the desecrated Jewish graves in St. Louis,” the statement from Executive Director Steven Goldstein. “Make no mistake: We have been critical of President Trump for his gross insensitivity to Antisemitism, including through his omission of Jews in Holocaust remembrance. But through the Vice President’s visit to St. Louis today, this Administration finally showed America the kind of response our nation was waiting for all along — a response filled with proactive heart.”\nFollow Gina on Twitter .\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNN/status/834511747486658562", "https://twitter.com/VP/status/834519387382149120", "https://www.facebook.com/AnneFrankCenterforMutualRespect/posts/10155155483484040", "https://t.co/GrJe5PfYOX", "https://t.co/QlMZDM4Q4c", "https://t.co/PWTFLGqqz0", "https://twitter.com/VP/status/834519192590249984", "https://t.co/Flbm88l1Us", "http://people.com/politics/mike-pence-visits-vandalized-jewish-cemetery/", "http://twitter.com/ginamei"], "published": "2017-02-23T15:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:38:05.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
