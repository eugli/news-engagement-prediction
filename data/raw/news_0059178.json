Credit Mary Altaffer/Associated Press When is a new, budget offering actually a hidden increase in overall cost? When the airline industry introduces new economy fares. Over the last week, United Airlines and American Airlines joined Delta Air Lines in starting or announcing plans for a “basic economy” fare option geared toward bargain travelers. For these major airlines, a “basic economy” ticket means the airline will transport travelers where they want to go. Most everything else, though, costs extra, ending many of the remaining niceties provided by large commercial carriers. Gone is the ability to choose a seat free. (Hello, middle seat!) Upgrade or refund under the new fare? Forget it. And, under some airline rules, do not even think about putting a suitcase into an overhead bin without paying. Something else travelers do not always get with the basic economy fare: an actual price discount. While airlines are loath to discuss pricing, the new basic economy class seats are expected to be in many cases the same price as the standard economy fare, meaning travelers will get less for the same price. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Instead, the old-fashioned economy ticket — the one with the niceties — is expected to cost more. “Yeah, the same product is going to be more expensive,” said George Hobica, the president of Airfarewatchdog.com . “It’s like they were saying you were getting an introductory offer and that they were giving it away, but no longer.” The one upside? Basic economy travelers will still get soda and mini pretzels — for now. For United, which began offering basic economy fares this week from the Minneapolis-St. Paul region to its seven hubs, a round-trip flight on May 9 from Minneapolis to Denver under the standard economy fare will cost $176. The new basic economy fare for the same flight will be $136. Basic economy travelers will not be allowed to choose their seats or carry on a bag, so they would have to pay $25 each way to check their bags, raising the price of the basic economy fare round trip to $186. And basic economy fare passengers who try to sneak bags on board will be charged the $25 bag check-in fee plus a $25 gate-handling charge. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
