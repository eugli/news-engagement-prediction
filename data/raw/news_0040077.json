Even though the Atlanta Falcons blew a 25-point lead to the New England Patriots, you can take some comfort in this master-level trolling by Zoo Atlanta. \nBefore Super Bowl LI, the zoo made a bet with the Roger Williams Park Zoo & Carousel Village that the losing side would name one of their baby animals after the other team’s quarterback. \nZoo Atlanta’s choice? An adorable Madagascar hissing cockroach. Say hello to little Tom Brady!
