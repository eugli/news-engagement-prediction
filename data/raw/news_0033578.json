Supreme Court set aside the judgement of high court, uphelding trial court judgement. Sasikala will be taken into custody with two other convicts for the remaining term. The apex court asked Sasikala to surrender immediately. \n\nThe apex court restored in toto the judgement and the findings of the trial court in Bengaluru which had held guilty all the accused including Sasikala's two relatives, V N Sudhakaran and Elavarasi. \n\nThe two-judge bench comprising Justices P C Ghose and Amitava Roy directed Sasikala and the two relatives to surrender forthwith to the trial court in Bengaluru and serve the remaining part of four year jail term. \n\nAlso Read: What will now happen to Sasikala, Panneerselvam and Tamil Nadu? \n\nThe verdict disqualifies Sasikala from becoming a legislator, and consequentially she can't be chief minister either. \n\nThe bench read the operative portion of the voluminous judgement saying that \"according to the materials and evidence place on record, we set aside the judgement and the order of the high court and affirm in toto the judgement and order the trial court convicting the accused persons.\" \n\nThe bench said since Jayalalithaa has expired, the proceeding against her is abated. \n\n\"Nevertheless, we reiterate that having regard to the facts, the charge framed against them by the trial court is restored,\" the bench said. \n\n\"Since the charges framed by the trial court have been restored against all of them they will surrender forthwith before the trial court and serve the remaining part of the sentence,\" the bench said. \n\nThe trial court had sentenced Sasikala and her two relatives to four years imprisonment with a fine of Rs 10 crore each. Jayalalithaa was sentenced to four years with a fine of Rs 100 crore. \n\nThe ramifications of verdict: \n\n1. This means Sasikala cannot contest election for 10 years after conviction \n\n2. Four years jail for Sasikala. \n\n3. Sasikala to pay penalty of Rs 10 crore. \n\n4. Sasikala will have to surrender for the remaining jail term \n\n5. Sasikala can't become CM of Tamil Nadu \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:22:57.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
