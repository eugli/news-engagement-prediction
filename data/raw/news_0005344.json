On 30/01/2017 at about 9pm, I went to Mr Teh Tarik@ Khatib as my sick wife was craving for the ban mian there. So while she was queueing to order her food, i went over to the drink stall and join in the queue to a drink for my wife. When it was my turn, conversation with the BLACK SHIRT STAFF went like this: \nMe: bang, teh o ais satu. [1 Iced Teh O] \n(He then started making my drink) \nWhen the drink was ready, he placed the cup on the counter and then he turn to his cashier system to key my order. Noticing that there was no cover for the drink, i politely requested in malay: \nMe: Bang, die nye cover ade bang ? [Bro, got cover,bro?] Advertisement \nStaff: Cover? Ni nak minum sini ke nak take away? [Cover? You wanna drink or takeaway] \nMe: take away bang. \nStaff: O take away ehhh. Cakap la lain kali [Say lah] (with a smirk on his face and in a very very sarcastic tone) \nMe: aah bang take away. [Bro takeaway] \nStaff: (while taking the cover and covering my cup) Ohhhh take away. Lain kali cakap la take away ke, minum sini ke, DRIVE THROUGH KE. [Ohhh takeaway, say lah want to takeaway or having here. You think drive-thru issit] (He raised his voice) \nMe: knape bang? Saya mintak cover jek bang, lagi pon abg pon tak tanye pe nak minum sini ke take away. [Why bro? I just asked for cover. You also never ask having here or takeaway] (Both started to raise voices) \nThe next minute, he took my cup which was on the counter, turn to his right and tossed my drink into the sink and told me to get lost and immediately asked for the next customer's order WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THIS ?!?!?!?! \nLook at the picture and you can see that the bin is nearer to him but he managed to toss it into the sink instead !!!! I strongly feel that such behaviour is very inappropriate If its just verbal argument i would have probably just forget about it but he threw away my drink while i was handing over to him my money !!!! \nFrom the picture also, i can see that there are cameras overlooking the counter. I hope the management will view the footage and look into this matter seriously !! I believe the customers queueing behind me and his partner wearing the grey tshirt witnessed the incident as well !!! \nI LOVE THE FOOD THERE AND I ALWAYS GO TO MR TEH TARIK KHATIB BRANCH BUT WITH SUCH POOR ATTITUDE STAFF AROUND, I WILL NEVER PATRONISE THIS BRANCH AGAIN Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
