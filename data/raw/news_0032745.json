Di Maria struck the ball beautifully, getting his effort up and down in time to leave Ter Stegen no chance.\nIt took Barca time to respond but when they did, thanks to Neymar's powerful run and pass, it was nearly 1-1.\nWith Neymar drawing defenders towards him Andre Gomes found room on the overlap, collecting a measured pass only to see goalkeeper Kevin Trapp divert his shot wide.\nA Barca break, predictably orchestrated by Neymar, left them exposed on the counter and PSG came close to a second in the 33rd minute when Draxler breezed past Roberto and struck at the near post. Ter Stegen, flinging a glove to his right, made the save.\nThey deservedly doubled their advantage before half-time after an off-colour Messi gave up possession to Rabiot in midfield. Veratti advanced at speed and when he switched the play to Draxler 12 yards out, the German buried his shot.\nThe second half was even more one-sided, with La Liga's reigning champions lethargic and susceptible to PSG's pace and purpose in attack.\nIt took them just under 10 minutes to score again, this time building from the back and sweeping aside a tired press from the Barca frontline.\nDi Maria was the ultimate target and he was inexplicably allowed to cut in from the right, unchallenged as he moved into shooting range and bent a left-footed effort into the corner.\nThe tracking may have been lacking, notably from Iniesta, but Di Maria's execution was superb. Moments later he was gone, replaced by Lucas Moura after a memorable hour's work.\nThe fourth felt inevitable and was threatened on several occasions before Thomas Meunier sauntered upfield and slotted in Cavani. With Pique failing to get tight enough, the striker calmly dispatched his shot past Ter Stegen.\nUmtiti somehow headed against the post from a yard as the lifeline of an away goal evaporated but Luis Enrique's humbled outfit might easily have walked away with an even more damaging defeat.", "external_links": ["http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0214%2Fr180754_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=570,", "http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0214%2Fr180754_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=750&cquality=40", "http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0214%2Fr180754_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=1140&cquality=40", "https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fespnfc.com%2Freport%3FgameId%3D469095&description=PSG+thrash+Barcelona+as+Angel+Di+Maria+scores+twice&media=http%3A%2F%2Fa.espncdn.com%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0214%2Fr180754_1296x729_16-9.jpg", "http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0214%2Fr180754_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=375,", "http://es.pn/2kQl6Cz", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?href=http%3A%2F%2Fes.pn%2F2kQl6Cz&app_id=116656161708917", "http://facebook.com/dialog/send?link=http://es.pn/2kQl6Cz&next=http://es.pn/2kQl6Cz&app_id=116656161708917", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?lang=en&url=http%3A%2F%2Fes.pn%2F2kQl6Cz&text=PSG%20thrash%20Barcelona%20as%20Angel%20Di%20Maria%20scores%20twice"], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:41:59.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
