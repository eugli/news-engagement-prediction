Whitney, who has stood by Lee throughout his recent difficult months, couldn’t believe her eyes when she read the note which said Lee doesn’t love her anymore. He had also left his wedding ring in the envelope before leaving. \nHis decision came after Mick advised him to walk away as Whitney deserves better. Later, Lee had a heart to heart with Patrick Trueman at the allotments and Patrick gave him food for thought when he suggested that sometimes you have to start over to fix things. (Picture: BBC) \nAt the meal, Lee tried his hardest but the atmosphere was fraught, especially as they were surrounded by happier couples. As Whitney assured Lee that everything would be okay, even when they faced their next tough times, he realised that he didn’t want his wife to just be constantly weighed down by heartache. (Picture: BBC) \nMaking out he needed to get something, Lee walked away and offered a lingering look to the wife he was leaving behind, something which proved that the note he left wasn’t true. \nAs Whitney is left devastated by Lee’s departure, have we now seen the last of Lee as Danny-Boy Hatchard departs the show? (Picture: BBC) \nOr might the story still have some way to go? \nSome fans will inevitably be worried that the note might actually be a suicide note as Lee previously contemplated jumping to his death as things got on top of him after Christmas. Are EastEnders lining up a tragic ending that will leave Whitney and the Carters even more distraught? \nWe reckon that after Patrick warned Mick about the weight of the world being on Lee’s shoulders that he might have second thoughts about Lee going off into the unknown alone. (Picture: BBC) \nCan Lee be tracked down? And will he be persuaded to come home? \nOr has Whitney seen the last of her husband and destined to think that he fell out of love with her? \nEastEnders continues on Thursday 16th February at 7:30pm on BBC One.
