These are their statistics, not my statistics.\" \nTRUMP MAY HAVE BEEN UNCLEAR, BUT SWEDEN EXPERIENCING A MIGRANT CRIME WAVE \nAt the Florida event Saturday, Trump said Sweden \"took in large numbers\" of refugees and was \"having problems like they never thought possible.\" Trump later specified on Twitter that he was referring to Carlson's original segment with Horowitz, which aired Friday night. \nTrump's remarks, which implied that a terror attack had hit Sweden Friday night, was roundly criticized by Swedish officials and mainstream media outlets. A pair of policemen Horowitz interviewed for his film also took issue, with one referring to him as a \"madman.\" \n\"Can you imagine the amount of pressure that must be on them from their bosses because of this maelstrom that they’ve kind of found themselves in?\" Horowitz asked. \"  discussed [how] they didn’t want to be considered racist.   used the words ‘no-go zones’ in describing these Islamic enclaves [in Swedish cities], not me.\" \nHorowitz also denied he had deceived the policemen with a general discussion of crime in Sweden rather than crimes committed by refugees and migrants. \n\"I’ve never had a subject claim, and certainly not prove, that I ever misled them or ever doctored the footage,\" Horowitz said. \"It’s never happened before. So, my record stands for itself, and what you saw on that video clear as day stands for itself.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:15:51.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
