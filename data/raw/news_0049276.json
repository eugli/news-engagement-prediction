He has said remarks he made that could be construed as favoring men and boys having sex were edited wrongly. \n“Dangerous” was originally scheduled to come out in March. But Yiannopoulos had pushed back the release to June so he could write about the uprisings during his recent campus tour. At the time of his publisher’s announcement, it ranked No. 83 on Amazon’s overall list and No. 1 in the subcategory of Censorship & Politics. \nMore than 100 Simon & Schuster authors had objected to his book deal, which was announced last December, and Roxane Gay withdrew a planned book. \nSome bookstores had said they would not sell his book, although the National Coalition Against Censorship and other free speech organizations had defended the publisher. \nThreshold is a conservative imprint that has published books by Republican President Donald Trump and Republican former Vice President Dick Cheney among others.
