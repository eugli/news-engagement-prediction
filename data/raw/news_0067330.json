Article continues below What caused an angry reaction from Antoine Greizmann's vs Bayer Leverkusen \nOne of those players are getting an upgraded face is Lionel Messi. \nThe Barcelona superstar is one of the best players on the game and the gamers, unsurprisingly, want him looking as lifelike as possible. \nBut that’s not exactly going to be the case. \nDespite him getting a new face, it appears EA Sports are keeping with his blonde hair on his FIFA Ultimate Team card. \nMessi ditched his peroxide look months ago but he is still sporting that look on FIFA. And it seems we’ll have to persevere with a blonde Messi with his updated FUT card showing his old hair. \nTake a look: \nAnd don’t think that this issue will go unnoticed by FIFA gamers. That’s because plenty of them took to Reddit , per Dream Team , to complain about Messi keeping his blonde hair. \n\"Still has blonde hair,” one gamer pointed out. \n\"Why would they update Messi, with an outdated pic????,” another user asked. \n\"Wh t? Still blonde hair!?\" exclaimed a third. \nHowever, one gamer appeared to have the answer by explaining it would be a lot more difficult to update Messi in game. \n“Because it wouldn't make sense to update his face card but still have him blonde in game,” they answered back. \n“It's a lot harder to update this through a patch and also people will also want updates on all other players like Neymar if they change Messi.” \nSo it seems that we’re just going to have to put up with a blonde Messi for a little while longer. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
