The left-arm spinner took six wickets for 35.(REUTERS) \nFew have been fortunate enough to witness how Eknath Solkar wove his magic at short-leg. Most have only heard those tales. In Pune though, on Friday, Peter Handscomb gave us a feel how thrilling and rewarding close-in catching can be. You may get hit once in a while. But those scooped up catches, going full length at the reaction time of less than a second, can win big matches. ( LIVE BLOG | LIVE SCORECARD ) \nAustralia are now fancying that chance, thanks to a superlative fielding effort by Handscomb and a super six-wicket haul by Steve Oâ€™Keefe. TEA! What a session. Australia lead by 201 runs. A LEAD. Of 201 runs. Gee whiz! ðŸ˜² https://t.co/XqvYc0QYaV #INDvAUS pic.twitter.com/JmsCXnyRKz â€” cricket.com.au (@CricketAus) February 24, 2017 \nFrom Mitchell Starc to Steve Oâ€™Keefe and Nathan Lyon, the facilitators for Peter Handscomb changed from time to time. Virat Kohli is the most prized wicket for Australia but the most crucial dismissal was that of Ajinkya Rahane in the 33rd over. India had just lost a settled KL Rahul and couldnâ€™t afford to lose more ground.

(AP) \nBut Peter Handscomb pulled off a stunner. Looking to hit the ball to the leg-side, Rahane got an edge that Handscomb lunged to his right and picked up just inches above the ground. This was after Handscomb had held on Virat Kohliâ€™s edge that came at the rate of knots to him at first slip. . @klrahul11 brings up his 2nd Test 50 and leads India's reply.

With four Test centuries to his name, Ravichandran Ashwin is Indiaâ€™s designated No.6 and a technically proven batsman in crunch situations. India have lost 6-7. â€” cricket.com.au (@CricketAus) February 24, 2017 \nBut Australia were on the upswing. Lyon was spinning the ball prodigiously and Ashwin, trying to defend close to his pads, ended hitting the ball straight to his boot. \nIt bounced off the boot, prompting Handsomb to once again dive forward and almost pluck it out of air. Both close-in catches had to be bounced off the third umpire but judging by his celebration, there was never any doubt in Handscombâ€™s mind. Steve O'Keefe produced an incredible spell of bowling on day two in Pune. Here's how it all unfolded: https://t.co/UWVHn8apBP #INDvAUS pic.twitter.com/rUqQtAMwrI â€” cricket.com.au (@CricketAus) February 24, 2017 \nBy then Oâ€™Keefe, one of the older players in this Australian side, was on a roll. There were stories of how Oâ€™Keefe kept rolling his arms at the camp in Dubai before this, how he was squeezing information from consultant Monty Panesar who has been here and done that. His toil showed in Pune. \nBoosted with the double haul of Rahul and Rahane, the left-arm spinner started bowling a tighter line, getting more grip and bounce. \nIt made Wriddhiman Saha, who scored a century against Bangladesh in Hyderabad, look so tentative that he didnâ€™t know whether to come forward or defend. His wicket was only a matter of time. \nSo was Ravindra Jadejaâ€™s wicket, after Oâ€™Keefe had got Jayant Yadav stumped. Hardly a good defender, Jadeja was lured easily into a catch by Oâ€™Keefeâ€™s flight, resulting in the first five-wicket haul of his career. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:20:30.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
