Kadean Construction is building the structure — its fourth at Aviator. Completion of the $12 million to $15 million building, named Aviator 10, is scheduled for August. \nMark Branstetter, the Panattoni partner in charge of the company’s St. Louis office, said the firm is discussing Aviator 10 with a variety of potential tenants. \nReal estate sources said Amazon, which opened two distribution centers last year in Edwardsville, appears interested in a facility in Hazelwood. They noted that the company began last week to collect sales taxes in Missouri. \nDavid Cox, Hazelwood's economic development director, said Amazon typically collects sales taxes only in states where it has facilities. \n\"We're hearing that Amazon is looking,\" said Cox, adding that city officials had not spoken directly with company representatives. \nHazelwood officials believe Amazon wants a facility that would allow same-day delivery to customers who order small consumer goods, Cox said. \nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T09:15:39.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
