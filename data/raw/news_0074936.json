They settled in Country Durham and had two children together. She now also has one grandchild.\nHer sister-in-law Angela confirmed to the Northern Echo that Clennell had been deported. She said she had been subject to “insensitive and unfair government rules” and that Irene’s husband, her brother, was seriously ill.\nA Go Fund Me page to raise money for her legal fees passed £6,000 after the news broke that she had been deported\nOn the page, Angela said: “For 30 years, my sister-in-law Irene has lived in Britain after arriving here from Singapore. She has a British husband, two wonderful British children and a granddaughter she dotes upon. \n“She has worked hard for those 30 years raising her family and being an important and beloved member of the local community.\n'How is this fair?': readers on the non-European spouses income ruling Read more \n“Without her to look after him, we’re all worried for him, and to rip apart a family after 30 years of happiness seems so unfair. Irene has never claimed benefits in the UK. John has worked his entire adult life. We need to fight to keep them together so he has someone to care for him, and so she can stay with her family, where her home is.\n“Irene has nowhere to go in Singapore, both her parents have passed away – her whole life is here in Britain.” \nClennell was given indefinite leave to remain in the UK after marrying John in 1990 but spent periods back in Singapore caring for her parents before they died. \nThe government’s spousal visa system requires the British partner to prove earnings of at least £18,600 – and the couple being able to show long stretches of uninterrupted time living in the UK.\n\nClennell lost her leave to remain as the time she spent out of the country when her parents were dying was too long. She has made repeated attempts – both in Singapore and back in the UK – to re-apply for permission to live with her husband.\nHer last visitor visa expired last year and she was sent to a detention centre in Scotland after a routine appointment with immigration service in mid-January.\nClennell told Buzzfeed, who she spoke to on the plane before it took off, that she had just £12 in her pocket, no change of clothes and nobody to stay with in Singapore.\nAlthough she was allowed to phone her husband with the news, she was so distressed, she was barely able to speak. “I didn’t even get to say goodbye properly,” she said. “I was just in tears, I wasn’t able to say much.\n“They just came to get me this morning and said they’ve already given me a chance. Now I’m on the plane. Four people are taking me to Singapore. I don’t know what I’ll do when I land. I called my sister [in Singapore] and she said she can’t put me up, so I just don’t know.” \nHer husband told the website that he had no idea the deportation was going to happen despite having visited her on Friday. \nHe said: “I think it was done deliberately so we couldn’t contact a solicitor or go through the courts. I think it’s trickery to come on a Sunday when you can’t contact your lawyer ... I need people to see what these people have done.”\nAngela Clennell told the Northern Echo that the family had been unable to intervene because the flight took place on a Sunday. “I made several attempts to ring immigration and solicitors,” she said. “But nowhere was open. They just came and removed her without prior warning. It’s unbelievable.\n“It’s appalling. But we are still hoping to get Irene back home.”\nA Home Office spokesperson said: “All applications for leave to remain in the UK are considered on their individual merits and in line with the immigration rules. We expect those with no legal right to remain in the country to leave.”\nImmigration and asylum Family law news   Share   Reuse this content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:01:15.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
