Their show is one of just a handful of concerts remaining on the books at the Joe, which will close this fall as the Wings head to the new Little Caesars Arena. \nSmith says the band’s booking agent offered a choice on this tour between the Joe and the Palace of Auburn Hills. The answer was easy. \n“It’s always cool playing my hometown, but we’re playing the storied venue of Joe Louis Arena, which is sadly going away,” he says. “I get it — you’ve got to have a fancy new complex, and that’s great. But this is the closing of another historic venue.” \nThe Getaway tour comes amid a busy stretch for the 55-year-old drummer: Last month brought the premiere of “Landmarks Live in Concert,” a PBS music-and-travel series with Smith as host and interviewer. The show's hook: Artists are featured sharing insights and performing at locales close to their hearts. \nThe first episode, featuring Alicia Keys at New York’s Apollo Theater, was followed last week with Brad Paisley visiting the West Virginia University football stadium. Still to come are visits with Andrea Bocelli and Sting — and Smith agrees that a Detroit episode would make a smart choice, “if we can get (the right artist) who's involved with the city.” \n“It’s a cool twist on the live (music) thing,” Smith says. “It’s a chance for these artists to tell their stories. It’s not just an interview. We chat about what the city and place means to them, and why. For the most part we really want to get into the stories of the landmark — why it’s so iconic, what it means to them — and then they start talking about all kinds of stuff.” \nChad Smith (right) with Alicia Keys on the debut episode of the PBS series \"Landmarks Live in Concert.\" (Photo: City Drive Group) \nSmith was approached for the gig by “Landmarks Live” director Dan Catullo, who’d produced a 2009 concert DVD with another Smith band, Chickenfoot. Catullo was there last year when Smith teamed up with celebrity lookalike Will Ferrell for an L.A. comedy and charity event, impressed by what he saw. \n“Will and I hosted, and Dan said, ‘That was great — you’d be great at this (TV role),’” says Smith. “I think PBS was a little nervous. Like, they wanted it a little edgy, but it was still: ‘The Chili Peppers? What’s he going to do?!'” \nAnd so the gregarious drummer with the signature backward ball cap, the guy who famously posed nude with his band mates on the cover of Rolling Stone, is now the face of one of public television’s high-profile new programs. \nIt didn’t hurt that he'd already been honing his interviewing skills via his podcast, “In Conversation with Chad Smith.” The well-received series, which debuted in 2013, has put him face-to-face with assorted artist friends — Pearl Jam’s Stone Gossard, Rush’s Alex Lifeson, Carlos Santana — for loose-ended conversations about life in rock. \n“I haven’t had any really tough ones yet,” says Smith, though he chuckles when he remembers his talk with the notoriously ornery English drummer Ginger Baker. “Being artists and musicians, we’re peers, talking about stuff we have in common. It probably makes it easier for them to open up.” \nAfter three decades in the rock spotlight, Smith is certainly accustomed to being in the other interview chair, and he says he’s gleaned some lessons. \n“Some people have their questions, looking down at a piece of paper the whole time. But to me, if you have enough time, the good interviews are conversations,” he says. “As a musician, you have to be a good listener. It’s more real, more organic. You can see their personality, go as deep as you want and, as you probably know, if they start blathering too much, you just kind of have to steer it back.” \nSAN FRANCISCO, CA - FEBRUARY 06: (L-R) Musicians Anthony Kiedis, Flea and Chad Smith of The Red Hot Chili Peppers perform onstage during the DirecTV Super Saturday Night co-hosted by Mark Cuban's AXS TV at Pier 70 on February 6, 2016 in San Francisco, California.

Trips to the metro Detroit diner were a Friday-night family ritual, Smith says, and burgers there remain a must-do when he's back. When the Chili Peppers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, his mom showed up backstage at the ceremony with a pan of them. \nDetroit has never been far from his mind since he headed west three decades ago, but Smith says lately he's been rooting more than ever for his hometown. And this time, the long-elusive \"Detroit comeback\" feels real — \"certainly getting a lot of press out here in California, including the arts community.\" \n\"It's such an important city in the United States for so many things, culturally and industrially,\" he says. \"It's been through rough times, but it seems like it's on its way back, and that's heartwarming to me. I'm a Detroiter — wherever I go around the world, I'm proud to say I'm from there.\" \nThere's one new tune that fans at the Joe are guaranteed to hear Thursday: the song \"Detroit,\" a rumbling funk-rocker from last summer's album \"The Getaway,\" stocked with lyrical nods to Motor City figures. \nThe song was born from a riff concocted by guitarist Josh Klinghoffer and hammered out by the band during a rehearsal session. As is customary, singer Anthony Kiedis — himself a Michigan native — worked up lyrics and a melody at home before bringing them back to a band jam. \n\"He started singing, and I'm hearing 'Funkadelic' and 'J. Dilla' and 'Henry Ford,' wondering, 'what the (hell) is this about?'\" Smith recounts. \"And then the chorus comes in: 'I'm like Detroit, I'm crazy.' So it's a love letter to Detroit! Anthony asked me, 'What do you think?' I said, 'It's great — I love it!'\" Red Hot Chili Peppers \nWith Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue \n7:30 p.m. Thursday \nJoe Louis Arena, 600 Civic Center, Detroit \n313-396-7000 \n$52-$102 \nNEW YORK, NY - JULY 16: Musician Chad Smith performs on stage at the John Varvatos fashion show after party at Electric Room on July 16, 2015 in New York City.
