But if Mr. Beshear can be expected to present an unthreatening message to voters in the political middle, it is his work on health care that has made him a national figure in the Democratic Party. \nAdvertisement As governor, Mr. Beshear opened a state health care exchange, known as Kynect, and accepted federal money to expand Medicaid coverage in Kentucky. The number of Kentuckians without health insurance fell to 7.5 percent in 2015 from 20.4 percent in 2013 , tied with Arkansas for the most dramatic plunge in the country. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Beshear has been a consistent voice of optimism about the Affordable Care Act among Democrats, and he predicted several years ago that the law would prove so popular, after being fully carried out, that it would more likely be expanded than repealed. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The law faces a far more uncertain prognosis, after Republicans won control of the White House and kept control of Congress in 2016 after campaigning on a pledge to unravel the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Beshear’s successor as governor, Matt Bevin, who is a Republican, won federal approval last fall for a plan to dismantle the Kynect exchange and move the state into the federal exchange. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But polls have shown the Affordable Care Act growing in popularity recently , during the debate over its possible demise, and Republicans in Congress are plainly struggling to make good on their vow to “repeal and replace” it. Mr. Beshear’s response to Mr. Trump’s address will not be his first role in a presidential address to Congress. In 2014, he attended President Barack Obama’s State of the Union speech as a guest of the president, who hailed his work on health care from the well of the House of Representatives. “Kentucky’s not the most liberal part of the country, but he’s like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth’s families,” Mr. Obama said of Mr. Beshear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T20:38:02.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
