It is not yet clear whether it includes option years, Heyman notes. An announcement is expected tomorrow. The sides were said to be “making progress” in extension talks, according to a report from Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports, who noted that a deal in excess of $50MM over five years was likely for the Octagon client. \nMartinez and the Cards have long been engaged on a long-term deal, and now won’t have to wait for Spring Training to wrap them up. The sides were set for a hearing over the 25-year-old’s first-year arbitration salary, with him filing for $4.25MM and the team submitting at $3.9MM. (MLBTR contributor Matt Swartz, for what it’s worth, wrote recently that he felt Martinez was worth a lot more in view of his arb comps.) \nWe recently assessed Martinez’s extension candidacy, which in many ways lacked appropriate comparables to help guide a deal. As explained in that piece, a contract that landed somewhere between those reached by Corey Kluber ($38.5MM over five years, with two options) and Matt Harrison ($55MM over five years, with one option) seemed to make sense. Indeed, that’s just what appears to be in the works. As Heyman notes, the deal constitutes a record for a first-time, arb-eligible pitcher. Martinez tops Kluber, who was a Super Two and also significantly older, in setting the new mark. . \nWith the move, the Cards now control Martinez through at least 2021 — his age-29 season. A power righty with two outstanding breaking balls and a useful change-up, Martinez carries an ace’s arsenal. He hasn’t quite reached that lofty status, but could well be on his way. Martinez owns a 3.02 ERA since the start of the 2015 season, so the results are already excellent. Though he hasn’t yet sustained top-end strikeout numbers — he owns 8.5 K/9 and 10.4% swinging-strike rate for his career — Martinez arguably has the capacity to do so. He also boosted his groundball rate to a robust 56.4% in 2016 and has a track record of limiting hard contact and home runs. If Martinez can continue to improve his change, and further boost his performance against left-handed hitters, he has a chance to deliver enormous value over the life of the contract. \nDurability, of course, is another key factor. Martinez did approach the 200-inning level last year, notching 195 1/3 frames after spinning 179 2/3 the season prior, but still needs to prove he can chew up innings year-in, year-out. He’ll surely be given the opportunity now to work later into games and establish himself as a true workhorse. A related area to watch is health. Though Martinez’s track record in that regard is a good one, youngsters who throw so many hard pitches have been shown to have slightly elevated risk of requiring Tommy John surgery.
