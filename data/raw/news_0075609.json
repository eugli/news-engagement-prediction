Senior guard Robert Hubbs notched 30 and sophomore guard Shembari Phillips had 29 minutes while also coming off the bench. Kyle Alexander started and played 26 minutes. “Those guys I thought played hard,\" Barnes said. \"They made some mistakes, but you could tell they were in the fight — f or as long as it was a fight.” \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

As Barnes' rotation shortened, the bench got longer and longer. Redshirt freshman guard Lamonte Turner played 15 minutes and freshman point guard Jordan Bone played 10. Freshman guard Kwe Parker started, but only played eight minutes. Fifth-year senior forward Lew Evans played 12.

Is confidence lacking as this Tennessee team keeps reeling? “It could be,” Barnes said. It looked that way for a second straight game. After falling behind 25-10 in the first half against Vanderbilt on Wednesday, a 67-56 loss at Thompson-Boling Arena, the Vols got behind 27-9 at South Carolina. Since the four-game winning streak in late January that changed the trajectory of this Tennessee basketball season, the Vols have managed to go just 2-5, losing the five games by an average of 13.8 points. “I think confidence definitely has something to do with it,” Alexander said after scoring five points and grabbing eight rebounds against South Carolina. “When I was a freshman, I shied away from the ball because I didn’t think I could score. “It’s just getting in the gym, working on your craft and feel confident. I think confidence definitely has something to do with it. Your teammates have to pick you up.” Tennessee averaged 82.5 points per game in consecutive wins over Mississippi State, Kentucky, Kansas State and Auburn, using an inside-out offense that had multiple options, leaning on ball movement and spacing. The stagnant Vols have been held under 60 points four times in their last seven games, including their last two. Tennessee had 20 turnovers to just three assists on Saturday. It was 12 assists to 10 turnovers in Wednesday’s loss to Vanderbilt. “It’s not just (turnovers),” Barnes said, “it’s (guards not) getting us into our offense. We’ve seen them play better, obviously, but just like teams can go through tough times, players can go through some tough times.” “Our front court, all the pressure is on those guys,” Barnes added. “We have to get something out of our backcourt.” Barnes conceded that turnovers are going to be committed against a South Carolina team that hangs its hat on the defensive side of the floor. Hubbs said his team was just being careless with the basketball, himself included. (Photo: Tennessee athletics, UTSports.com) As for confidence issues, Hubbs had less of a definite answer. “I guess you could say that,” he said. “I’m not really sure. We just need everyone to step up, just play basketball and play together.” The Vols, at least in stretches, did just that against both Vanderbilt and South Carolina. Tennessee on Saturday cut the 19-point hole dug in the first half down to four points when Hubbs scored with 18:01 to play. South Carolina answered with a 17-4 run to regain control and start running away. The Vols twice got back within one point against Vanderbilt, after trailing by 15. The Commodores hit a couple dagger threes down the stretch, getting the lead back to double-digits. Those oh-so-close rallies, Shembari Phillips explained, means confidence isn’t an issue for his team. Instead, it’s finding a full 40 minutes. Expanding those windows of good basketball for as long as possible. “I would say it’s more sustaining it,” Phillips said. “You have to have the mindset that we’re going to play for 40 minutes. We come out with that mindset, but we’ll sometimes put 20 minutes together, or 25 or 30. “We have to put together a full 40.” With two regular-season games left, though, time is running out to do so. “We have LSU and Alabama and then the SEC tournament,” Philips said. “We just have to try to pick it from here and try to get some wins.” \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
