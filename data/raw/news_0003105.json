This year's big players were clearly Alabama Crimson Tide tight end O.J. Howard and Temple Owls linebacker Haason Reddick, with relatively lesser-known players like Western Michigan Broncos offensive tackle Taylor Moton , Ohio Bobcats defensive end Tarell Basham and Eastern Washington wide receiver Cooper Kupp jumping into the top 64 after strong weeks, as well. \nPlayers are listed by name, position, school, year, height, weight and 40-yard dash time \n1. Myles Garrett , DE, Texas A&M, Jr, 6-5, 262, 4.74 \nGarrett is the most gifted prospect in this class, though his production (33 tackles, including 15.5 for loss and 8.5 sacks) was way down in 2016 in comparison to his first two seasons (53-14-11.5 in 2014 and 59-19.5-12.5 in 2015). An ankle injury robbed Garrett of his trademark explosiveness throughout much of his junior campaign but he offers a Pro Bowl-caliber combination of initial quickness, change-of-direction and length, projecting as an immediate difference-maker as a defensive end or stand-up edge rusher. \n2. Jonathan Allen , DL, Alabama, Sr, 6-3, 292, 4.85 \nWhereas Garrett was slowed by injury, Allen maintained his season-long perch as my top-rated senior prospect regardless of position. Capable of creating havoc while lining up inside or out, Allen reminds me a little of Seattle Seahawks Pro Bowler Michael Bennett , winning with an explosive upfield burst and powerful, coordinated hands. \n3. Leonard Fournette , RB, LSU, Jr, 6-1, 230, 4.45 \nPart of the reason why scouts were unfazed with Fournette's decision to skip the Fiesta Bowl is that he struggled with an ankle injury this year, finishing the regular season second on his own team in rushing yards (843 yards, eight touchdowns) to sophomore sensation Derrius Guice (1,249-14). While Fournette's struggles this season are not ideal, when healthy he has shown the most exciting blend of size, speed and power among running backs since Adrian Peterson . \n4. Jamal Adams , S, LSU, Jr, 6-0, 211, 4.48 \nIt is easy to mistake Adams for former LSU Tigers star Tyrann Mathieu , given their similar instincts and highly aggressive playing style. Like Mathieu, Adams possesses the agility and speed to handle coverage duties on slot receivers, possesses soft hands for the interception and is a tenacious run defender. Adams' kamikaze style of play can lead to occasional mistakes, but he is always around the ball. Adams has shades of Honey Badger to his game. USATSI \n5. Solomon Thomas , DL, Stanford Cardinal , rSoph, 6-3, 272, 4.85 \nAfter focusing on seniors and fourth-year juniors throughout much of the season, scouts are still just starting the evaluation of Thomas and a host of other gifted redshirt sophomores but once they do, you can expect his name to shoot up draft boards as quickly as he has mine. Thomas was as impressive on a snap-to-snap basis as any prospect in the country in 2016, demonstrating the initial burst, power and advanced hand usage to earn comparisons to Los Angeles Rams star Aaron Donald . \n6. Dalvin Cook , RB, Florida State Seminoles , Jr, 5-11, 206, 4.46 \nWhile Fournette's blend of size, speed and power are certainly intriguing, one could argue that Cook offers the greater recipe for success in the NFL . He offers terrific instincts as a runner, showing vision, patience and burst attack on the ground. Just as importantly in today's pass-happy era, Cook possesses soft hands out of the backfield, as well as the toughness and selflessness to block, when necessary. Cook ended his career in style, running for 145 yards and a touchdown and adding another 62 yards as a receiver to help beat Michigan Wolverines in the Orange Bowl. \n7. Reuben Foster , ILB, Alabama, Sr, 6-1, 240, 4.72 \nInside linebackers rarely warrant top-10 consideration but Foster is an exceptional talent. Foster might be the most intimidating hitter in all of college football and he possesses the fluidity and speed to cover. He is a more explosive athlete than Alabama's recent stars at linebacker, showing ridiculous closing speed and an utter disregard for his own safety or that of his opponents. \n8. Mike Williams , WR, Clemson Tigers , rJr, 6-3, 220, 4.50 \nWith all due respect to his quarterback and national title game MVP, Williams was the most impressive player on the field in Clemson's win over Alabama. He possesses enough speed to challenge downfield and uses his frame and remarkable body control to haul in contested passes with ease, projecting as a true No. 1 receiver in the NFL. \n9. Malik Hooker , FS, rSoph, Ohio State Buckeyes , 6-2, 205, 4.47 \nNicknamed \"Malik the Freak\" because his combination of size and athleticism stands out even among the talented Buckeyes, Hooker exploded onto the scene in 2016, finishing tied for second in the country with seven interceptions, while wowing with his instincts and sideline to sideline speed. Hooker only has one season as a starter and is prone to over-aggression as an open-field tackler, but scouts are giddy about his upside. \n10. Mitch Trubisky , QB, rJr, North Carolina Tar Heels , 6-3, 220, 4.74 \nThe 13 starts of his college career all came in 2016, but Trubisky is my top-rated quarterback in the class. As you'd expect given his limited experience, Trubisky is a work in progress reading defenses and he lacks ideal size. However, he grades very well in many of the areas that I believe to be the greatest indicators of future success at the NFL level, including mobility in and out of the pocket, arm strength and most importantly, accuracy to all levels of the field. \n11. Zach Cunningham , LB, Vanderbilt Commodores , rJr, 6-3, 230, 4.74 \nListed 18th overall on my initial Big Board back in August, Cunningham only reinforced my opinion throughout the regular season that he warrants top-20 consideration. Instinctive, aggressive and athletic, Cunningham offers an exciting and versatile skill set sure to intrigue any creative defensive coordinator in the NFL. Cunningham led the SEC with 125 tackles in 2016 -- 22 more than he posted a year ago, when he earned first-team All-SEC honors despite not starting until the fourth game. Cunningham reinforced the hype with another big 2016. USATSI \n12. Derek Barnett , DE, Tennessee Volunteers , Jr, 6-3, 257, 4.76 \nA more polished defender than even the top-rated Garrett, Barnett has silenced critics (including me) who questioned prior to the season whether he possessed the length and burst to warrant a first-round selection. While perhaps lacking in pure explosiveness, Barnett varies his attack, incorporating quickness, power and refined technique to wreak havoc against both the run and pass. Those close to the program rave about his work ethic, and Barnett's production speaks for itself. Barnett passed the late Hall of Famer Reggie White as Tennessee's all-time sack king in a Music City Bowl win over Nebraska Cornhuskers . Barnett's 33 sacks lead the country over the past three seasons. \n13. Ryan Ramczyk , OT, Wisconsin Badgers , rJr, 6-5, 316, 5.29 \nThe Badgers are well known for producing quality offensive linemen, but Ramczyk (pronounced Ram-check) comes with a unique backstory as a transfer from D-III UW-Stony Brook. Possessing uncanny agility and balance for a player of his size, Ramczyk possesses the agility that appeals to zone-blocking schemes and was the most consistent pass protector I saw this season. \n14. Jabrill Peppers , SS/OLB, Michigan, rSoph, 6-0, 208, 4.48 \nUnfortunately, Peppers made headlines for all of the wrong reasons in the Orange Bowl, with a hamstring injury sidelining him for the game. Despite his absence in this critical matchup, defensive coordinators looking for versatile playmakers will be highly intrigued by Peppers, the latest in a new line of defensive \"erasers\" capable of lining up at safety, linebacker or cornerback similar in style to recent first-round picks Deone Bucannon , Damarious Randall and Shaq Thompson. Peppers' agility and instincts routinely show up with big plays near the line of scrimmage but he was beaten in coverage by Curtis Samuel in the showdown with Ohio State. \n15. O.J. Howard, TE, Alabama, Sr, 6-6, 249, 4.57 \nDespite relative pedestrian numbers at Alabama, Howard entered the week of practice as the top-rated player at the Senior Bowl and certainly lived up to the billing, wowing with his freakish combination of size, speed and soft hands. \n16. Teez Tabor , CB, Florida Gators , Jr, 6-0, 199, 4.52 \nTabor's first name was Jalen, until this summer when he chose a new name that may provide a more accurate description of his game. Tabor teases with an exciting combination of size, fluidity and speed, standing out in coverage and as a gunner on special teams the past two years. He is a more consistent pass defender than his former teammate, Vernon Hargreaves , the No. 11 overall selection (Tampa Bay) last year. \n17. Marshon Lattimore , CB, Ohio State, rSoph, 6-0, 195, 4.47 \nLike his teammate, Hooker, Lattimore broke out in a big way in 2016, recording a team-high 13 passes defensed, including four interceptions after struggling with hamstring injuries over his first two seasons. Lattimore could follow his former teammate Eli Apple 's ascent up draft boards as the process moves forward as scouts pore over his tape and note his quickness, balance and speed in coverage. \n18. Corey Davis , WR, Western Michigan, Sr, 6-3, 213, 4.48 \nWith his FBS-record 5,212 career receiving yards (and 51 touchdowns), a prototypical frame and polished route-running there is a lot to like about Davis. Unfortunately, a shoulder injury kept him from competing at the Senior Bowl and he is reportedly in danger of missing the Combine as well after suffering an ankle injury. \n19. Cam Robinson , OT, Alabama, Jr, 6-5, 327, 5.28 \nAs his monstrous size implies, Robinson can be a road-grader in the running game and his quickness and length can make him very effective in pass protection. He reminds me in many ways of recent early first round picks Ereck Flowers ( New York Giants , No. 9 overall, 2015) and D.J. Fluker ( San Diego Chargers , No. 11 overall, 2013), each of whom are highly regarded by scouts, though often criticized by the media and fans. Robinson, honored as this year's Outland Trophy winner, has starred at left tackle for the Tide since earning the job as a true freshman but his NFL future may be on the right side or even inside at guard. Robinson may kick inside to guard at the next level. USATSI \n20. John Ross , WR, Washington Huskies , rJr, 5-11, 190, 4.35 \nRoss was limited to just five catches for 28 yards by Alabama but this was more a reflection of Washington's inability to get him the ball in space. Perhaps no player has improved his draft stock more this year than Ross, who has overcome two separate serious knee injuries earlier in his career to rank among national leaders with 17 touchdown receptions, including one in the Pac-12 championship win over a Colorado Buffaloes secondary filled with NFL prospects. Ross is a DeSean Jackson clone with blinding straight-line speed, agility and versatility as both a receiver and returner. \n21. Marlon Humphrey , CB, Alabama, rSoph, 6-1, 198, 4.53 \nTeams prioritizing size and physicality will find a lot to like with Humphrey, the son of former Alabama star and NFL first-round pick Bobby Humphrey ( Denver Broncos , 1989). A former track star, Humphrey is built well for a young player at a solid 6-foot-1 and 198 pounds and is an aggressive tackler, including in run support. \n22. Christian McCaffrey , RB, Stanford, Jr, 6-0, 202, 4.48 \nDespite Stanford's struggles, McCaffrey was every bit as dynamic as in past seasons -- quietly again leading the Pac-12 in rushing (145.7) and all-purpose yards (211.5). With his easy agility, instant acceleration and soft hands, reminds of another former Pac-12 star, Reggie Bush . Like Bush, McCaffrey lacks the bulk to be a true bell-cow back at the next level but his ability as a returner and as a potential slot receiver add to his value. \n23. Takkarist McKinley , OLB/DE, UCLA Bruins , Sr, 6-2, 258, 4.58 \nThe NFL loves freaky athletes and they don't come much more explosive than McKinley, a former track star who has steadily developed into one of the nation's most fearsome edge rushers. Like Lawson, McKinley possesses the upfield burst and bend to attack off the corner (as his 10 sacks in 11 games this season imply), but he is not \"just\" a pass rusher, showing the awareness and closing speed to drop into coverage or spy mobile quarterbacks, as well. \n24. Sidney Jones IV, CB, Washington, Jr, 6-0, 181, 4.49 \nA big part of the Huskies' ascent into the playoffs in 2016 was due to its extraordinary secondary, which will see three members (senior Kevin King , junior Budda Baker and Jones) drafted this spring. Jones is the most polished of the bunch. A silky-smooth athlete with excellent awareness and composure with the ball in the air, Jones has a shot to be the first cornerback selected, though some worry about his somewhat slim frame. While Alabama showed its muscle against the Huskies, it is worth noting that the Crimson Tide did not attempt a single pass in Jones' direction in the Peach Bowl. \n25. DeShone Kizer , QB, Notre Dame Fighting Irish , rSoph, 6-4, 230, 4.84 \nKizer is the most gifted draft-eligible quarterback prospect in the country with a prototypical blend of build, arm strength and functional athleticism. He possesses the kind of undeniable talent that could lead to a much earlier selection than my ranking, but he is far from a surefire franchise quarterback, making head-scratching decisions or simply inaccurate passes in virtually every game this season. Kizer threw for 2,925 yards and 26 touchdowns against nine interceptions this season for the 4-8 Fighting Irish. Teams will not overlook that Brian Kelly has produced just one NFL quarterback (2010 sixth-round pick Tony Pike , Carolina Panthers ) in 26 seasons as a head coach. \n26. Taco Charlton , DE, Michigan, Sr, 6-5, 272, 4.87 \nCharlton missed out on a huge opportunity by opting not to attend the Senior Bowl but scouts are excited about him, nonetheless. A twitchy athlete with prototypical length, burst and bend off the edge, Charlton registered a career-high 9.5 sacks in 2016 and may just be scratching the surface of his potential. \n27. Malik McDowell , DT, Michigan State Spartans , Jr, 6-5, 282, 4.92 \nScouts are intrigued by McDowell's blend of size, strength and athleticism, which has allowed him to play virtually every position along the defensive line over the past three seasons for the Spartans. Unfortunately, for all of his talent McDowell has also shown a troubling tendency to get nicked up, missing snaps in several games in 2016, leading to questions about his durability and grit. \n28. David Njokue, TE, Miami, rSoph, 6-4, 240, 4.65 \nHe started just five of 13 games for the Hurricanes in 2016, but Njokue emerged as one of the nation's most productive tight ends, hauling in 43 passes for 698 yards and eight touchdowns. Njokue will drop an occasional easy pass but his agility and acceleration are top notch for the position, projecting as a legitimate matchup nightmare in the NFL. \n29. Carl Lawson , OLB/DE, Auburn Tigers , rJr, 6-2, 253, 4.67 \nFinally healthy after missing 19 of 26 games over the 2014-15 seasons with a torn ACL and hip injury, Lawson recorded a career-high nine sacks for the Tigers this over the regular season after flashing opposite Kansas City Chiefs first round pick Dee Ford as a freshman. Lawson wins with a fearsome combination of initial burst, core strength and a relentless motor. \n30. Haason Reddick , LB, Temple, rSr, 6-1, 237, 4.54 \nReddick starred as an undersized edge rusher for the Owls (recording 22.5 tackles for loss and 10.5 sacks in 2016) but it was the agility and acceleration he showed playing off the ball in Mobile that has his stock skyrocketing as one of the few true three-down linebackers in this class. Reddick wowed with his off-the-ball play in Mobile. USATSI \n31. Tim Williams , OLB, Alabama, Sr, 6-3, 252, 4.76 \nPass rushers rank second only to passers themselves in today's NFL, and Williams might just be the country's most dynamic threat off the edge. Williams terrorizes opponents off the edge with his snap anticipation, first-step quickness and flexibility to turn the corner, but he comes with significant off-field questions that will need to be answered during interviews at the combine. \n32. Deshaun Watson , QB, Clemson, Jr, 6-2, 215, 4.64 \nThere is no denying that Watson was spectacular in guiding Clemson to its first national championship since 1981, accounting for 463 yards and four touchdowns in the big win over the favored Crimson Tide and their vaunted defense. His competitiveness, big-game moxie and dual-threat talents are exciting. Watson starred in a relatively QB-friendly offense that did not ask him to make multiple reads before running and he has shown less-than-ideal accuracy throughout his career, leading the country with 28 interceptions over the past two seasons. \nFinishing the Top 64: \n33. Dan Feeney , OG, Indiana Hoosiers , rSr, 6-4, 310, 5.09 34. DeMarcus Walker , DT, Florida State, Sr, 6-2, 273, 4.86 35. Tre'Davious White CB, LSU, Sr, 5-11, 192, 4.50 36. Dion Dawkins , OG, Temple, Sr, 6-5, 320, 5.27 37. Garett Bolles , OT, Utah Utes , Jr, 6-5, 296, 4.97 38. Dorian Johnson , OG, Pittsburgh Panthers , Sr, 6-5, 300, 5.20 39. Dede Westbrook , WR, Oklahoma Sooners , Sr, 5-11, 175, 4.39 40. Marcus Williams , FS, Utah, Jr, 6-0, 195, 4.56 41. Desmond King , CB/S, Iowa Hawkeyes , Sr, 5-10, 200, 4.53 42. Charles Harris , DE, Missouri Tigers , rJr, 6-3, 255, 4.74 43. Chidobe Awuzie , CB, Colorado, Sr, 5-11, 205, 4.56 44. Jourdan Lewis , CB, Michigan, Sr, 5-10, 188, 4.43 45. Taylor Moton, OT, Western Michigan, 6-5, 330, 5.31 46. Tarell Basham, DE, Ohio, Sr, 6-4, 259, 4.64 47. Gareon Conley , CB, Ohio State, rJr, 6-0, 195, 4.50 48. Quincy Wilson , CB/S, Florida, Jr, 6-1, 213, 4.54 49. Obi Melifonwu , S, Connecticut Huskies , rSr, 6-4, 219, 4.54 50. Forrest Lamp , OG, Western Kentucky Hilltoppers , rSr, 6-3, 302, 5.12 51. Chris Wormley , DT, Michigan, rSr, 6-5, 302, 4.92 52. Evan Engram , TE, Mississippi, Jr, 6-3, 227, 4.64 53. Alvin Kamara , RB, Tennessee, rJr, 5-10, 215, 4.62 54. Caleb Brantley , DT, Florida, rJr, 6-2, 314, 5.23 55. Cameron Sutton , CB, Tennessee, Sr, 5-11, 186, 4.50 56. Fabian Moreau , CB, UCLA, rSr, 6-0, 205, 4.43 57. T.J. Watt , OLB, Wisconsin, 6-4, 243, 4.79 58. Adoree' Jackson , CB/WR/RS, Southern Cal, Jr, 5-11, 185, 4.43 59. Roderick Johnson , OT, Florida State, Jr, 6-6, 308, 5.10 60. Cooper Kupp, WR, Eastern Washington, Sr, 6-1, 198, 4.54 61. Budda Baker, FS, Washington, Jr, 5-10, 192, 4.52 62. Curtis Samuel, WR, Ohio State, Jr, 5-11, 200, 4.52 63. Cordrea Tankersley , CB, Clemson, Sr, 6-0, 200, 4.48 64.
