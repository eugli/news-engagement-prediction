AT&T Unlimited Plan will include unlimited talk, text and data on 4 lines for $180. \nAT&T said after 22 GB of data usage, it may slow speeds during periods of network congestion, which is becoming pretty standard with these type of plans. \nAT&T is hitting back at the unlimited data plans announced by Verizon , Sprint , and T-Mobile , earlier this week. ZDNet compared each of these unlimited plans and found them comparable. \nPrevious unlimited plans from AT&T required customers to be DirecTV subscribers. \nAT&T's pricing of $180 is after a $40 credit for the fourth smartphone line, which will start after two billing periods. Prior, customers will pay $220 per month for the unlimited plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:09:46.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
