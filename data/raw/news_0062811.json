What’s Getting Cancelled? What’s on the Bubble? \nThat’s just one of the things you will learn from perusing TVLine’s hand-dandy, hand-carved calendar of season openers ( The Americans , da!), series premieres ( Iron Fist is ready to swing), returns (President Kirkman, we hardly know ye), finales and specials on tap for the coming month. \nHere is our round-up of March premieres and finales, plus a glimpse at select dates from an extremely active April.
