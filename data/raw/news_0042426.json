PHOTOS | DAILY NATION By JUSTUS OCHIENG \nEight journalists have left newsrooms to contest elective seats in the August elections. The journalists include former Standard Group editors Enoch Wambua (Kitui Senate) and David Ohito (Ugenya MP). \nOthers are Citizen TV pundit David Makali (Bungoma Senate), Jicho Pevu’s Mohammed Ali (Nyali MP), Matiko Bohoko (Kuria West), Kendagor Obadiah (Kapenguria), Anderson Ojwang’ (Karachuonyo), Josiah Murigu (Kirinyaga Central) and Bernard Omondi (Uriri). \nSome of the journalists, who spoke to Nation on Wednesday, said they had joined politics because they wanted to be part of the solution and not just highlighting problems in the society. \nMEANINGFUL CHANGE \n“I have covered raids between the Pokot and Turkana, hunger facing my people as well as low standards of education. I feel it is the right time to get to leadership position,” said Mr Obadiah, a former Citizen TV reporter. \nMr Ohito said: “I am perturbed by high poverty levels in Ugenya and poor infrastructure in most schools where classrooms are still smeared with cow dung. I am offering that meaningful change for the good of my people.” \nMr Murigu of Jubilee Party, said most leaders had failed to articulate issues affecting their people. \n“Most of them lack the passion to fight for Kenyans,” he said. \nMr Ojwang’ recently lit up campaigns in Karachuonyo by giving match boxes. \nHe said that he would uplift the economic standards of the residents “so that Karachuonyo becomes a producer rather than a consumer constituency.” Latest Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:23:40.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
