(Adam Hunger/AP) Tuesday, February 21, 2017, 10:43 AM \nThe $21 million special instructor has arrived. \nAlex Rodriguez showed up to Yankees spring training Tuesday morning in Tampa, where he’s expected to work with players for three days. \nA-Rod entered the coach’s locker room a little after 10:30 a.m. \nHal Steinbrenner has previously described how he could see the retired third baseman’s role expanding within the organization. \n“We haven’t talked about that, and obviously he’s been doing more broadcasting as well and he’s got other things going on in his life,” Steinbrenner said. “But the more he’s involved, he’s been absolutely tremendous with the young players — always has been — and we’re going to continue to talk about different ways he can be involved.” \nA-Rod was unconditionally released by the team in August, during a season when his production tailed off significantly. The 41-year-old is in the final year of his huge 10-year, $275 million contract he signed with the Yankees in 2007.
