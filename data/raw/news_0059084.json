There just happens to be a photographer on the beach? Wow, what a startling coincidence. \nTurning her back on crime and reaching for the sun cream, Michaella McCollum has been papped catching some rays on a beach in Spain four years after she was caught smuggling drugs into Majorca from Peru. Peggy, 96, has been volunteering at a homeless shelter for 80 years \nThe 23-year-old, along with accomplice Melissa Reid, was sentenced to six years and eight months after admitting trying to smuggle 24lb (11kg) of cocaine worth £1.5 million. \nMcCollum spent three years in a cell before returning to her native Dungannon, Co Tyrone in Northern Ireland 2016 thanks to a deal with Peruvian authorities. Michaella McCollum was ‘papped’ on a beach in Spain (Picture: iCelebTV) Michaella McCollum has ditched her trademark bun (Picture: Rex) Michaella was freed from Peruvian jail last (Picture: iCelebTV) \nFollowing her return, McCollum has jetted away on holiday and lo and behold, a glamorous set of bikini pictures have emerged. Hunters who accidentally shot one another blamed illegal immigrants \nThe images show that McCollum has ditched her trademark high bun in favour of a wistful glance down a sunny beach. \nWearing a black strappy bikini, shades and a kaftan, another of the images shows McCollum paddling in the shallow waves, apparently blissfully unaware a professional photographer is just metres away. \nHow peculiar. Probably no room for 24lb of cocaine in that bikini (Picture: iCelebTV) McCollum didnt seem to noticed the photographer – despite being pictured from all angles Picture: iCelebTV) Nope, still unaware of the lurking photographer (Picture: iCelebTV) \nAfter she tires of the beach, McCollum – with dedicated paparazzi in tow, naturally – is seen strolling along coastal shops and cafes – perhaps pondering the meaning of life, or what reality TV offers may come her way? Girl, 16, died in her sleep after drinking incredibly cheap cider \nEarlier this month, McCollum described her fight for release and settling back into life at home as ‘a long ride’. \nUpdating her Facebook friends, she wrote: ‘Now that I have the chance I just want to thank everyone who has supported myself and family through these past few years. \n‘Please know I truly appreciate each one who cared and had my back. Thank you for all the sweet messages I have not got reading them all just yet or got a chance to reply to them but I will definitely make a good attempt to get back to you all. McCollum says her journey back home was a long ride (Picture: iCelebTV) Still being trailed by that pesky pap (Picture: iCelebTV) \n‘It has been a long ride to get where I am today but it just shows that when we fight hard enough for something we can achieve.’ \nMcCollum and Reid, from Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire, travelled to Peru on August 15 2013, and were caught trying to leave the country with the Class A drug at Lima Airport two days later. \nThey faced the prospect of a maximum 15-year prison term but struck a behind-closed-doors plea bargain to secure the shorter sentence. McCollum spent three years in a cell (Picture: iCelebTV) McCollum covers up with a kaftan and takes a stroll past some shops and cafes (Picture: iCelebTV) \nAs well as a selfie showing a new blonde hairstyle instead of the previously favoured bun, McCollum told friends of her hopes for the future despite her criminal record and notorious profile. \nShe said: ‘When one door closes, another opens; but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us.’ \nImmediately after their arrest the pair said they had been forced to carry the drugs by a gang, though they later admitted the charges. Melissa Reid and Michaella Mccollumare led away by Peruvian police (Picture: Rex) More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:35:37.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
