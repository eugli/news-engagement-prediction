While it has changed in design over the years, that horizontal bar has become synonymous with the operating system. But did you know you can set it to appear vertically? \nWe’re not only going to show you how to get a vertical Taskbar, but also argue its case. It might seem like a strange change at first, but trust us when we say it’s something worth trying out. \nIf you’ve got any thoughts to share on a vertical Taskbar, or if you’ve been using one for a while, please let us know in the comments. How to Get a Vertical Taskbar \nFirst, right-click an empty space on your Taskbar. Then check to see if Lock the taskbar has a tick next to it. If it does, click it, otherwise you’re already set. Next, left-click and hold an empty space on your Taskbar and drag it to either the left or right of your screen. Release your mouse, then lock the Taskbar. That’s it! The Benefits of a Vertical Taskbar \nWithout further ado, let’s discuss why you should use a vertical Windows Taskbar. 1. Widescreen Displays \nMonitors with a 4:3 aspect ratio were standard when the Taskbar first hit the scene. It made sense to have the Taskbar on the bottom to maximize the limited real estate you had on screen. However, now your monitor is likely to be far wider than it is tall, meaning you have more horizontal space to play with than you do vertical. \nConsider also that many websites and applications don’t make full use of horizontal space and are designed responsively to account for mobile displays. Take this very website — you can happily lose a bit of white space on the sides to benefit from fitting more of the article on screen. 2. See More at Once \nNow that you have horizontal space to play with, you can extend the Taskbar past the thin strip you’re used to. For this, hover on the border of the Taskbar until the cursor changes. Then left-click, hold, and drag to make the Taskbar wider. \nYou’ll benefit from being able to see the full date and time, plus more of the icons in your tray and any toolbars you might have enabled Use Windows 10's Secret Taskbar to Navigate Like a Pro Use Windows 10's Secret Taskbar to Navigate Like a Pro Finding files and folders on Windows 10 can be a nuisance, so here's a quick way to find them without any navigational headaches.

More Natural to Read \nYou might think that reading left to right is natural for the majority of the world, but if you have your Taskbar spread out over a huge horizontal space it isn’t totally efficient. Instead, having your Taskbar vertical means that you quickly see everything with a single glance at the side of your screen. \nEvery window is a separate row on the Taskbar, so you can quickly scan down the list and find the icon and window name. It might not seem like a major benefit, but it’s a subtle quality of life improvement that you’ll find hard to go back from. 4. Less Obstructive \nThis one is especially true if you’re using a touch device. Having your Taskbar at the bottom of your screen can be cumbersome to control, particularly if you have a keyboard attached at the same time because it can be awkward to reach. Placing the Taskbar on the side of your dominant hand is much more natural. \nAlso, if you set your Taskbar to autohide How to Auto Hide the Taskbar in Windows 10 Tablet Mode How to Auto Hide the Taskbar in Windows 10 Tablet Mode Now you can auto-hide the taskbar in Tablet Mode, which is a new feature arriving in the next big Windows 10 build!
