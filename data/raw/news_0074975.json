It comes after a long and bitter disagreement with management at the airport. \nShop owners say they’ve always maintained their business well but the airport was demanding $50,000 worth of improvements to the patio area. \n“It’s too bad, it was very popular with valley people,” said Judi Good from the Airport Coffee Shop. \n“There’s no reason for us to be evicted, in my personal opinion, unless it’s greed.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
