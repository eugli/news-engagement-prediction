The ticket matched all six numbers drawn on Saturday's Missouri Lotto game. The winning numbers from Saturday were: 6, 15, 19, 20, 26 and 38. \nLater the same night, a ticket purchased at Parker BP, 12095 Benham Road in St. Louis, matched all five white-ball numbers drawn in the Powerball drawing. That resulted in a $1 million Match 5 prize. The winning Powerball numbers were 5, 9, 17, 37, 64, and the Powerball number was 2. \nOn Monday, an even bigger winner emerged in Benton, Ill. The winning ticket for the $11.2 million Illinois lottery was sold at Circle K, 224 N. Main, in Benton, which is about 90 miles southeast of St. Louis. The winning numbers were 2, 21, 33, 36, 37, 41 and the extra shot number was 5. \nIf you are the holder of one of these winning tickets, you should sign the back of the ticket immediately, then claim the prize at one of the state lottery offices. \nLottery winners have 180 days from the date of the drawing to claim their prize. \nA previous Missouri Lotto prize worth $3.5 million remains unclaimed from the Nov. 12 drawing. That ticket was sold at Hermann Fuel Mart, 115B Highway 19, in Hermann.
