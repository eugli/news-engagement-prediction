CBS News finds the Statue of Liberty was intended to be a Muslim woman, sort of Posted at 8:50 pm on February 4, 2017 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nThe Statue of Liberty is everywhere these days; for example, the most recent cover of Germany’s Der Spiegel shows Donald Trump holding a bloody knife in one hand and Lady Liberty’s disembodied head in the other. \nPlenty of people are invoking “Liberty Enlightening the World” in the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration and refugees while citing the 1883 Emma Lazarus poem “The New Colossus” as if it were one of the founding documents. Wouldn’t it be ironic, then, if researchers were to find that the famous statue were actually a Muslim woman? \nCBS News certainly gave that impression Saturday with a short video segment it tweeted out, but which falls somewhere between “fake news” and “old news.” Statue of Liberty was originally intended to be a Muslim woman, researchers say https://t.co/J0u5MtzRYQ pic.twitter.com/8p0xSUXT1f \n— CBS News (@CBSNews) February 4, 2017 @CBSNews Really?? I've heard that originally CBS was meant to be a real news outlet \n— Frank Carozzi (@fcarozzi) February 4, 2017 @CBSNews only 30 seconds on this? Most likely bc it's a historical reach at best, and totally fake at worst (most likely).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:59:48.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
