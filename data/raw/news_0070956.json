These are things that are important to me.” Chief Roger Chaffin has not yet seen formal complaints from 13 #CPS employees – Welcomes their input on HR issues @GlobalCalgary pic.twitter.com/Wf7LPD2InA \n— Gary Bobrovitz (@garybtvnews) February 21, 2017 \nConst. Jennifer Magnus (née Ward) is among a dozen other officers and civilian CPS employees who allege they too were harassed and bullied. \nMagnus attempted to quit during a Calgary Police Commission meeting on Jan. 31, but Chaffin refused to accept her tearful resignation. He thanked Ward for having the “courage to speak out,” but said he wanted to talk to her about it again after “some time” had passed. \nMagnus said Tuesday she has since put her resignation on hold. \nWATCH: Female member of the Calgary Police Service publicly announces resignation at police commission meeting. \nAccording to a statement from Dunphy Best Blocksom LLP , the 13 employees allege that the Calgary Police Service (CPS) has “failed to provide a safe environment for certain employees, which has resulted in years of workplace bullying and harassment.” \n“The employees allege that the culture of the CPS protects those who engage in abusive and harassing conduct in the workplace,” the release stated. “In certain cases, when targets expressed their concerns to superiors, they were advised that nothing would be done if a complaint is filed.” \nAccording to the Calgary law firm, The Calgary Police Association, which is the union representing police officers, advised some of the employees “that it will not take on ‘blue on blue’ grievances” which left victims “feeling that they have nowhere to turn.” \nLawyer Rachel West said next steps could include a lawsuit against the CPS. \n“Well, I am a lawyer,” she said. “It’s always on the table.” \nREAD MORE: Diane Colley-Urquhart hopes female officer reconsiders resignation after emotional Calgary police meeting \nMagnus and her lawyer met with Chaffin on Feb. 16. \n“We did not discuss my resignation, we will do that at a later date,” Magnus said. “It was a positive meeting and he did agree to bring in an external investigators to look into my complaints, as well as the 12 other complaints. \n“I am encouraged, because [Chaffin] did make a positive commitment to bringing in an external investigator – which I feel is an important step.” \n“I believe this is a cultural issue that needs to absolutely change,” Magnus said. \nComplaints come from male and female CPS members. \n“We have sworn officers and civilian employees,” West told News Talk 770 . “The systemic culture of what happens once you’ve made a complaint, what happens once you’ve blown a whistle is very consistent across the board. \n“There needs to be a cultural shift, plain and simple.” \n“Supervisors need to take their supervisory responsibilities seriously. When they are informed of a complaint or a concern, their response cannot be to shut that individual down. They need to listen, they need to take action and they need to move that complaint through whatever appropriate channels there are.” \nWith files from Gary Bobrovitz © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
