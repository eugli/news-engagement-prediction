(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) \nA new study out finds that U.S. life expectancy will be at parity with Mexico by 2030. \nThe finding is surprising to many, as the United States is vastly more wealthy and advantaged than its southern neighbor. The U.S. enjoys a GDP per capita of more than $56,000, while Mexico's GDP per capita is slightly more than $9,000, according to World Bank statistics . \n[ MORE: Cancer, Heart Disease Battle to Be Nation's Top Killer ] \n\"Notable among poor-performing countries is the U.S.A., whose life expectancy at birth is already lower than most other high-income countries, and is projected to fall further behind such that its 2030 life expectancy at birth might be similar to the Czech Republic for men, and Croatia and Mexico for women,\" says the United Kingdom's medical journal \"Lancet,\" which published the study. \nThe research was undertaken by the World Health Organization and Imperial College London, CNBC News reports . The study analyzed life expectancy rates of 35 developed countries. CNBC reports that \"the U.S. was found to be on course for the lowest average life expectancy levels of all the rich countries worldwide.\" \nAccording to the \"Lancet\" data, South Korean women lead the pack, poised by 2030 to have a life expectancy over 90. \nThis United States is \"almost the opposite of South Korea,\" said Majid Ezzati of the Imperial College London. According to the study, current life expectancy levels in the United States rest at 76.5 years for men, and 81.2 years for women; by 2030, the U.S. is expected to enjoy only minimal gains in these figures. \nFor the United States, the research is similar to other troubling findings in recent years. Research in 2015 found that the members of the white working class were seeing increased mortality rates. \nThe mortality rate for white men and women aged 45-54 with less than a college education \"increased markedly\" between 1999 and 2013, the Washington Post reported , based on findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Abuse of legal and illegal drugs, alcohol and suicide were seen as likely contributing factors. A spike in the mortality rate for any such large swath of the population in an advanced nation was \"virtually unheard of in recent decades, with the exception of Russian men after the collapse of the Soviet Union,\" the Post noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:48:56.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
