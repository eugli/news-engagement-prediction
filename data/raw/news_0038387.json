Pizza delivery driver leaves note offering 'weed, MDMA, pills, ket, raw coke & much more' \nBut the now 21-year-old told ITV’s Loose Women today that she had already achieved her aim of campaigning for the age limit to be raised to 18. \nJane, who is from Edinburgh, admitted she had spoken to a lawyer but would not be pursuing any legal action. \nAsked if she still planned to sue, she said: ‘No. What I said was me phoning up the lottery and saying,”I think 16 is too young, you should up the age to 18″, they were never going to be like, ‘”Jane that’s great, we’ll up our age”. She had argued that 16 was too young to scoop the jackpot (Picture: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock) \n‘So what I did was, I’d only spoke to a lawyer, I was just wanting to seek legal advice just to get my point across, get it out there. \n‘But because it has gone so far already, I won’t even have to go any further, I feel like I have been listened to now and people are actually listening to the difficulties.’ \nShe added: ‘I’m not saying I’m completely unhappy because there is parts of my life that are good and there’s days that I wouldn’t change anything but there is days when I’m upset and it does get on top of me.’ \nJane said did not want to give her money away as she wanted to have children in the future and provide for them. \nHowever, in an interview on Sunday, she said sometimes she wishes she ‘had never won at all’ . But the 21-year-old told Loose Women she thinks she has got her point across (Picture: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock) Jane is the youngest Brit to scoop the jackpot (Picture:PA) \nHer frank admission came days after she pleaded not guilty to drink-driving at a McDonald’s. \nShe said: ‘People look at me and think, âEuro ~I wish I had her lifestyle, I wish I had her moneyâEuro but they donâEuro t realise the extent of my stress. \n‘They don’t know what they’re wishing for. They would need to spend some time in my shoes to understand. \n‘I have material things but apart from that, my life is empty. What is my purpose in life?’ \nShe added: ‘I think 18 should be the minimum age for winning the lottery, at the least. The current age of 16 is far too young. \n‘At times, it feels like winning the lottery has ruined my life. I thought it would make it 10 times better but it’s made it 10 times worse.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:40:04.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
