One message read: 'Ukip's Nuttall lied about \"close friends\" at Hillsborough. Can this man be trusted?' Another stated he wanted to privatise the NHS while one said his party only supported 12 percent of the population. The network of messages was uncovered by Alex King, a specialist researcher who tracks Russian propaganda on social media. He said the accounts were part of an organised campaign as opposed to individual users with their own agenda, according to the BBC . Mr King said the fact the users use stock pictures as profile images point towards it being a coordinated attack, as well as the fact that they are tweeting memes with multiple hashtags.

But by this evening, Labour's Gareth Snell had leapfrogged him to the top spot. Mr Nuttall last week being forced to admit claims on his website that he lost 'close personal friends' in the 1989 disaster were not true. He also failed to condemn Ukip donor Arron Banks for accusing Hillsborough survivors of 'milking' the tragedy. The embattled Ukip leader has angrily denied claims he was not at Hillsborough at all on the day 96 Liverpool fans were killed, insisting there is a smear campaign against him.
