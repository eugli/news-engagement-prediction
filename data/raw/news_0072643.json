Since then he’s received nods for such varied films as Top Gun, A Few Good Men, Con Air and Pearl Harbor. His most recent nomination, before Hacksaw Ridge, was in 2008 for Transformers. \nAhead of the ceremony, O’Connell said : “I think we have a better shot than in years past ... It’s a difficult category because there are so many really good movies. But we’ve also been nominated for best picture, best actor, best director and that means the Academy folks in general like the movie.” \nAn emotional O’Connell thanked his mother at the podium.
