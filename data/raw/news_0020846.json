U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said late Friday the Trump administration \"was disappointed\" to see that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had sent a letter to the Security Council announcing his intention to appoint Salam Fayyad as the next U.N. special representative to Libya. \"For too long the U.N. has been unfairly biased in favor of the Palestinian Authority to the detriment of our allies in Israel,\" Haley said, noting that the U.S. doesn't currently recognize a Palestinian state. She said the United States doesn't support \"the signal\" Fayyad's appointment would send within the United Nations . 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:22:22.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
