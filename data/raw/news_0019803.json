The commonwealth ombudsman has been charged with co-ordinating inspections and oversights.\n\nBrandis said Australian oversight would focus on “primary places of detention”, such as prisons, juvenile detention, police cells and immigration facilities.\n\n“Recent events have reminded us of the human, financial and other costs of mistreatment in detention,” Brandis told a human rights forum in Canberra. “The government is of the view that ratification and effective implementation of Opcat will encourage continuous improvement to inspection and conditions of detention. It will also assist in identifying and resolving issues before they escalate.\n“Australia will also welcome visits by the UN subcommittee on prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” \nJuvenile detention centres have attracted particular scandal in recent months. In particular the teargassing, isolating and mistreatment of children in the Northern Territory’s Don Dale prompted a royal commission and Victoria’s practice of housing children in the adult Barwon prison has been harshly criticised by human rights groups and subjected to legal challenges . \nSimilar concerns, including the alleged use of excessive force, have emerged about Tasmanian and Queensland facilities .\n\nThe Australian children’s commissioner, Megan Mitchell, told the royal commission ratifying the Opcat would have subjected Don Dale and its sister facility in Alice Springs to random unannounced compliance checks. \nAustralia’s onshore immigration detention centres, including the camp on Christmas Island, would be under the oversight of the Opcat.\nHowever, the offshore detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru – where refugees have been held for more than three years, and which are the subject of sustained criticism over systemic violence by guards, sexual assaults, including of children, and deaths from murder, suicide and inadequate medical care – would not be subject to Opcat oversight.\nPapua New Guinea is not a party to the Opcat. Nauru is a party but has not yet established its national preventative mechanism.\n\nThe Australian human rights commissioner, Ed Santow, told Guardian Australia the Opcat would make review of detention conditions more systematic although it would not set up new mechanisms to raise complaints about detention.\n\n“Take a hypothetical example like Don Dale – if Opcat was in place then an inspector would have gone into Don Dale and asked some serious questions about why spit hoods were used on juvenile detainees,” he said.\n\n“The Northern Territory government’s rationale was that it wanted to stop spread of disease. An Opcat mechanism would say that’s a legitimate aim but there are other more effective means of doing that which are more protective of young detainees’ basic rights.\n\n“It’s a really good way of identifying problems before they escalate and proposing solutions that are human rights protective.”\n\nSantow said the Opcat treaty would also help encourage uptake of recommendations of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, such as reducing hanging points.\n\n“There are still many places in prisons where there are hanging points, which make it easier and frankly more likely that vulnerable prisoners will commit suicide,” he said, adding that Opcat would audit problems and propose effective ways of fixing them.\n\nLabor warns against giving Peter Dutton 'Trump-like powers' to scrap visa rights Read more \nDr John-Paul Sanggaran, who worked at the Christmas Island detention centre and has campaigned for the ratification of the Opcat, told Guardian Australia the announcement “represents a real step forward in transparency and accountability, especially for those trapped in immigration detention”.\n“The direct international scrutiny which will be brought to bear through the Opcat should serve to help prevent the abuses we have seen in places like Don Dale and throughout the entire immigration detention network,” he said. “This is light in desperately dark places.”\nThe executive director of the Human Rights Law Centre, Hugh de Kretser, said Opcat was critical to “ensuring that people held behind closed doors in Australia are treated humanely”.\n\n“From the mistreatment of children at Don Dale to the death of Ms Dhu in police custody, we’ve seen how things can go tragically wrong,” he said. “This treaty is all about preventing mistreatment through independent inspection and monitoring. Implemented properly, it will promote safe, well-managed places of detention. It will reduce mistreatment and risks of deaths in custody.”\n\nThe co-chair of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services, Wayne Muir, said the ratification of Opcat was an acceptance by government that accountability in places of detention needed to be improved.\n“For far too long Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been overrepresented in prisons and youth detention facilities,” he said. “Having independent monitoring and oversight of detention facilities and police lock-ups is a critical step toward stopping the type of abuse and ill treatment we have seen at Don Dale and nationwide, and in preventing Aboriginal deaths in custody.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T11:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:37:08.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
