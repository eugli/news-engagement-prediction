Not enough.\" Her most recent tweet, directed at a friend, said, \"Have a safe trip Lulu. I love you baby girl! See you in 3 weeks! Kiss the Palestine ground for me and kill some jews! <3 #IMissYouAlready.\"\nTwitter\nThe messages were discovered by the Canary Mission, a watchdog group that exposes anti-American and anti-Jewish comments on the internet. Salem was one of 24 people associated with the University of Texas, Arlington chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine who were found posting anti-Semitic language against Jewish individuals and Israel.\nSalem's Twitter account has been disabled.\nThe school began investigating the tweets after parents complained, according to the Algemeiner , which first reported the story.\nThe Children's Courtyard school issued a statement on the investigation that was obtained by the Algemeiner .\nOur senior management team is working to address this matter. This in no way reflects the views of The Children's Courtyard. We strive to provide an inclusive environment for all children, families, and staff members.
