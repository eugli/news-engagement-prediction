Your child is happy to see you! Are you happy to see your child??\"\nSTUCK: Law school naming dispute hits impasse\n\"We have seen children trying to hand their parents their work they completed and the parent is on the phone. We have heard a child say 'Mommy, mommy, mommy...' and the parents is paying more attention to their phone than their own child. It is appalling. Get off your phone!!\"\nSince a photo of the note was shared on Facebook on Jan. 27, it was been shared more than a million times and received more than 7,000 comments and counting.\n\"I thought it was on point,\" Juliana Mazurkewicz, who posted a photo of the sign, told the Houston Chronicle Wednesday. \"I wasn't offended, and I thought it was a good reminder, to myself and others, of what's important.\"\nShe's been reluctant to name the childcare facility because of safety concerns for her child, adding that she's had thousands of people begin following her on Facebook. She explained that it's a small, independent business located in a local suburb and that the note was posted by its owner.\nSome parents feel the day care employee who allegedly shared this went too far, saying that working parents have it hard and lead busy lives. Some claim that it's unnecessarily judgmental.\n\"Wow!! How people judge others,\" one Facebook user wrote. \"Have you ever thought that the parent is teaching the child manners? That's rude to think you should drop what you are doing because your child is demanding your attention. Stop judging peoples parenting and do your own job which by the way includes helping parents, not judging them.\"\nIMMIGRATION HOLD: Katy high student caught in Trump's immigration ban\nOther commenters chimed in to say they agree with the childcare business, saying that parent should prioritize their children.\n\"These smart phone technologies are disconnecting us from reality and have become a giant distraction for parents,\" another person posted. \"Please parents, remember, you are role models.\"\nLeave us your thoughts in the comments below.", "external_links":
