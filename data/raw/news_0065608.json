There is an administrative cost and burden to doing that, but it’s not the point. What matters is the emotional attachment, the empowerment that employees feel when they own a part of the company. Because as owners, we not only have an opportunity to speak up, we have an obligation to speak up when we identify an opportunity to enhance the business, either by pointing out a weakness of a peer or pointing out a weakness in a process. How do you hire? An unwritten rule in our hiring process is that you cannot hire someone who isn’t smarter or better than you at your job, or won’t be better after they get up to speed. That’s by design, because if you hire B’s, then you become a B company. If you hire C’s, you become a C company. We also have a no-jerks policy, though we use a different word internally. Everybody’s got to be someone you’d want to spend time with, and who you’d want to sit next to on an airplane for six hours. Because life’s too short. Start-ups are too hard to not enjoy the people you’re around every day. If you construct a team that genuinely likes being together, culture is a byproduct of that. If you try and manufacture culture, with Ping-Pong tables and beer on Fridays in the office, then it’s not genuine and it doesn’t take on a life form of its own. In the interview, I will ask a lot about a track record, because I won’t hire anyone for a leadership position who doesn’t have a record of demonstrated success in the kind of role I’m hiring for. For entry-level people, the main quality we look for is tenacity. What career and life advice do you give to new college grads? Sometimes when I meet with new college grads who want to work here, they’ll say, “I’ll do whatever you need me to do.” And I get why. It’s simple, and the reality is they really don’t know what they want to do because they’re just out of college. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The tricky part is that I’m running a company and I don’t need people who can do anything. We call those people athletes, but we’re not really hiring all-around athletes. We’re hiring sales people who are athletes. We’re hiring marketers who are athletes. We’re hiring product managers who are athletes in that discipline. If you’re going to be entry level, that’s fine, but point yourself in a direction. Help me help you. Tell me you want to be in sales or marketing or customer service or customer success or engineering. If you come to us and you say, “I’ll do anything,” you automatically put yourself at the bottom of the pile of all the other candidates who are marching in one direction. \nEach week, Adam Bryant talks with top executives about leadership.
