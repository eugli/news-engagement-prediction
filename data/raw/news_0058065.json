Key points: People with back pain have 13pc higher chance of early death Medication mostly ineffective; physical activity can help Advocates say more government funding would ease strain on healthcare system \nA team of Australian researchers examined the health and death records of thousands of older sets of twins in Denmark. \nThey found those who reported lower back pain had a significantly higher chance of dying sooner than others. \nAssociate Professor Paulo Ferreira, a physiotherapy researcher at the University of Sydney, said back pain was not causing people to die but was a significant marker of impending mortality. \n\"We accessed data from over 4,000 twins in this particular dataset and we looked at the relationship between the presence of back pain and mortality rates,\" Dr Ferreira said. \n\"What we found is that people who have symptoms of back pain — and that includes lower back plus or minus neck pain — have a 13 per cent more chance of dying compared to those who don't have any symptoms in their lumbar spine.\" \nLike compound interest, that 13 per cent chance just increases every year. \n\"When we adjusted for other factors in the analysis in terms of statistical significance, this relationship reduced,\" he said. \n\"It's definitely a sign that if you have back pain, your health status is going to be much worse.\" \nHe said while surgery and medications are mostly ineffective for treating back pain, simply staying fit and healthy goes a long way. \n\"Those people who exercise more often — and I'm talking about the sort of pleasure type of exercise, moderate to vigorous levels of activity — those people will have less chance of developing back pain. \n\"Even if you develop back pain and you are physically active, your prognosis is going to be much better as well, compared to those who just decide to stay at home and lie in bed.\" Back pain costing economy $1 billion annually \nAn estimated 4 million Australians suffer from some form of back pain, from a twinge while bending up to debilitating chronic pain. \nIt costs the economy $1 billion a year in treatment expenses alone, according to researchers. \nHowever, physical activity is not always an option for all back pain sufferers. \nMichael Bates from the Australian Pain Management Association (APMA) said many people with chronic or persistent pain struggle just with daily tasks. \n\"It isn't simple to say get out and move around,\" Mr Bates said. \n\"Part of the problem with chronic pain is that it isn't one size fits all.\" \nAPMA has long advocated for additional government funding in the area of chronic pain. \nMr Bates said better funding could have long-term benefits for Australia's healthcare system as a whole. \n\"We've got one in five people suffering from this persistent pain and the stress that's put on the healthcare system,\" he said. \n\"There is no doubt that if we can get more resources into chronic pain then it will reduce the burden on the healthcare system.\" \nThe University of Sydney's research is published in the European Journal of Pain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:58:24.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
