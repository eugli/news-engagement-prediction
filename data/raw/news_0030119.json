Playboy magazine is bringing back nudity after instating a short-lived ban. In a post published to the magazine’s website on Monday, February 13, Hugh Hefner ’s son, Cooper Hefner , shared the brand’s new philosophy, which includes “reclaiming” what Playboy is all about.

Today we're taking our identity back and reclaiming who we are.\" \nTo that end, the cover of the magazine’s March/April 2017 issue features Elizabeth Elam , who stuns topless. The cover reads “Naked Is Normal” across her bare chest.

And so it's just passé at this juncture,\" he explained at the time, adding that the magazine would, however, still feature scantily clad photos of women. \n\" Playboy will continue to publish sexy, seductive pictorials of the world's most beautiful women, including its iconic Playmates, all shot by some of today's most renowned photographers,\" the publication said at the time. \"The magazine will also remain committed to its award-winning mix of long-form journalism, interviews and fiction.\" \nPamela Anderson was on the cover of the last nude issue, in December 2015. \nAt the time, Cooper wasn’t on board with the move, telling Business Insider that he “didn’t agree with [this] vision for the company.” \nThe March/April 2017 issue of Playboy hits newsstands on February 28. \nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics, and more delivered straight to your inbox!
