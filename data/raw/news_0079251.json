Report on free speech recommends fixing Racial Discrimination Act complaints process – as it happened Read more \nImmediately after the tabling of the report, Liberal moderates and rightwingers resumed their respective campaigns to either overhaul 18C or to limit any changes to the current regime to procedural changes. \nThe Liberal senator James Paterson, a Victorian rightwinger who favours significant legislative change, and was a member of the committee conducting the inquiry, said Tuesday’s report was “a big step forward on reforming 18C”. \n“There is now bipartisan consensus that the status quo must change. Everyone agrees that at the very least, the Human Rights Commission processes have failed and need to be overhauled,” Paterson said after the report was tabled. \n“Many committee members, myself included, also feel that 18C itself must be reformed to better protect free speech. \n“It’s now up to the government to decide exactly which path to take, but my view is that the words offend, insult and humiliate should be removed from 18C and be replaced by harass. \n“18D should also be reformed to bring it into line with defamation law by including a truth defence.” \nThis view was contradicted by New South Wales moderate MP Julian Leeser – also a member of the human rights committee – who hailed the report as “the first path forwards on fixing the problems surrounding section 18C and resolving this debate”. \nLeeser continued to insist – as he has done in internal government debates for some months – that legislative change was unnecessary. “Everyone involved with this law knows that the problem is the process,” the Sydney-based MP said on Tuesday afternoon. \n“The way the law is currently being administered allows too many nuisance complaints. \n“The threshold for making a complaint is so low as to be virtually redundant. These reforms will see that complaints with no prospect of success, such as those made against the QUT students and Bill Leak, thrown out.” \nIn terms of legislative options, the report spells out several potential pathways, including overhauling 18C to replace “insult” and “humiliate” with “harass”. \nSection 18C currently says it is unlawful for a person to do an act in public which is “reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate” another person or a group of people. \nAnother option would involve amending section 18D – which creates exceptions for artistic works, discussions, debates, event reports in the public interest and fair comment if it was in “expression of a genuine belief” held by the person making the comment – to include a “truth” defence against discrimination complaints. \nAnother option would involve changing the objective test currently in the law from “reasonable member of the relevant group” to “the reasonable member of the Australian community”. Submissions on 18C cite laws that pose 'greater risk' to free speech Read more \nIn terms of procedural change, there are a number of recommendations, including providing greater assistance to respondents to match what is currently afforded to complainants; and imposing time limits on the complaints-handling processes. \nThe report also flags giving the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) greater powers to terminate complaints earlier in the process; and restricting access to the courts following the commission’s termination of a complaint. \nIt also floats new penalties for legal practitioners instituting 18C complaints that have no reasonable prospects of success; and imposing more parliamentary oversight on the AHRC. \nThe report also supports strengthening education programs addressing racism, and programs educating the community about the protections offered under the RDA. \nA spokesman for the Human Rights Commission welcomed the report, and urged the parliament to desist from overhauling the legislation. \n“The commission remains of the view that section 18C and 18D of the RDA, as interpreted by the courts, strike an appropriate balance between freedom of expression and protection from racial vilification,” the AHRC spokesman said on Tuesday evening.
