(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post) As the final seconds ticked off the clock — when no more defenders could crowd her and St. John’s championship dreams were turning from long-term goal to something the team could finally touch — Aisha Sheppard knelt to the court and laid down. \nHer teammates began bouncing in celebration at midcourt. Her coaches, already leaking tears of joy, hugged by the bench. And there was Sheppard, somehow alone in a packed Bender Arena, smiling at the ceiling and clenching her fists while laying on the floor. \n“There was just too many emotions to even stand up,” said Sheppard, moments after St. John’s beat Paul VI , 58-52, to win the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference girls’ championship on Monday night in Northwest Washington. \n“We came so far and we finally did it. I’ve been working three years for this, and we finally did it.”\nThe past three years all ended the same way: With Paul VI hoisting the WCAC trophy. But the Cadets knew they could end that streak after beating the top-ranked Panthers by 16 on Jan. 24 . Paul VI bounced back with a four-point home win over St. John’s on Feb. 12 , and the season series boiled down to the title game.\nThe Panthers, as they did in their win over the second-ranked Cadets, had a defender closely shadowing Sheppard all game. St. John’s (28-2) played withoutinjured starting point guard Niya Beverley (ankle) for all but the opening minutes, which only heightened Sheppard’s place in both teams’ game plans.\nThe Virginia Tech commit scored five points in the first quarter and was slowed to just three in the second as Panthers senior Kate Klimkiewicz chased her around the perimeter.\nPaul VI (29-2) built a three-point halftime lead with nine first-half points from conference player of the year Mikayla Vaughn . The Notre Dame commit finished with a team-high 16 and helped the Panthers bully the Cadets inside — but Sheppard was just getting started. \nOnce she sped up, her team followed. \n“When she is scoring we get so hype, it means so much for us,” said junior Sydney Wood , who scored eight for the Cadets. “Once she got going I knew we were going to win.”\nIt started with a three to open the third. Next Shepard nailed a pullup three in transition. Suddenly St. John’s had traction, 5-foot-9 forward Jaylin Carodine was standing up to the Panthers’ imposing front line and the game was there for the taking. \nAnd Sheppard grabbed it. Another three broke a tie with four minutes left. Then Sheppard nailed another from the top of the key and the Cadets let by four. After a flurry of free throws put the game out of reach, Sheppard had more than just her biggest scoring output (24) since that Jan. 24 win over the Panthers. \nShe had closure for her high school career, validation for St. John’s and, at the top of it all, a championship. Finally, a championship. \n“I can’t describe it,” Sheppard said. “But it means absolutely everything to me.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:48:57.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
