James White (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 2 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 2 a.m. ET \nHOUSTON — Malcolm Butler is so two Super Bowls ago. James White is the unsung Super Bowl hero we care about now. \nWhite is the latest surprise Patriot to make a game-winning play in the NFL's biggest game, scoring the overtime touchdown in Sunday's 34-28 Super Bowl 51 comeback victory over the Falcons. \nReally, the fact that a third-string running back suddenly had a monstrous impact at the ideal time is so very much the \"Patriot Way.\" Nothing really fits coach Bill Belichick's team motto of \"Do Your Job\" better than that. \nMORE: Super Bowl 51, as it unfolded \nTheir best description of a No. 1 back, LeGarrette Blount, had a rough game, with 11 carries for 31 yards and a critical lost fumble. Their mismatch-creating quick scatback, Dion Lewis, was slowed down by the Falcons' fast defense. \nEnter White to dominate the game in the second half. He caught 14 of his 16 targets for 110 yards and a TD. He also was the Pats' most effective rusher, with six carries for 29 yards and two more TDs — the 1-yard game-tying score and the 2-yard walkoff. \nWhite didn't know if he was going to be playing every snap or no snaps, but in typical Patriots fashion, he played all the right snaps. \n\"I had an idea, but at the same time, you never know how the game is going to go,\" he said. \"I just wanted to be a viable option for my team whenever the ball came my way, blocking, running. I just wanted to do whatever it took to get a victory. It's the Super Bowl — you have to lay it all on the line.\" \nMORE: Lewis injured on final play of regulation \nWhite's combination of quickness and toughness, the ability to be more versatile than Blount or Lewis, paid off big time. Blount could have been that main man for New England, but he was just fine with White needing to be feature back du jour. \n\"Nobody on this team is selfish. We're a family out here and we have each other's backs through thick and thin,\" Blount said. \"No matter who is going to get the rock, who's playing the most, it's always going to be our group that supports each other.\" \nWhite was called upon to Do His Job a little bit more than usual. Belichick, as he does with with every one of his players, had full trust to thrust White into a very important role. \nSTEELE: In year of comebacks, Pats show no lead is safe \n\"James did a good job for us like he always does. He is a clutch receiver and very good with the ball in his hands,\" Belichick said. \"Two years ago he was inactive (for Super Bowl 49) . He has had two great years for us at that sub-back position.\" \nTom Brady, while winning his latest Super Bowl MVP, had to do a lot of chucking, dinking and dunking to help the Patriots erase deficits of 21-0 and 28-3. White had more than a fourth of his targets and almost a fourth of his 466 passing yards. \nMORE: 10 greatest Super Bowl performances by QBs \n\"He's just everything you want in a teammate and in a football player and he's dependable, consistent, durable,\" Brady said. \"The best attitude, he brings it every day. We just kept going to him. I think that speaks for itself.\" \nWhen describing the game-winning play, White even did that in the most Patriot Way — praising others for Doing Their Jobs. \n\"It was a toss play. The offensive line did a great job blocking. The receivers did a great job blocking. I just had to run through one guy and get the ball into the end zone,\" he said. \"I saw a crease. You have to find a way to make a play for your team at that point in the game — at the 3-yard line, 2-yard line, you just have to find a way in.\" \nDeCOURCY: The Falcons' epic collapse, in five acts \nLike Butler, White didn't quite know how to process making the jump to Star of the Game status. That was the only job he didn't do. \n\"I was just really excited,\" White said. \"That's what you dream about as a kid. It was an amazing comeback by our team and I'm just proud to be a part of it.\" \nIf the Patriots are able to win yet another championship soon, it's highly likely that another unlikely player will Do A Super Job.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T09:09:26.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
