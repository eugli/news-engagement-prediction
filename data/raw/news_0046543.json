It's not the suburbs, where square coffee table corners are given foamy bumpers and outlets are safeguarded with tamper-proof plugs. \nThere's no way you can child-proof a farm, so instead, you gotta take the opposite tact. Put kids in as many dangerous situations as possible and hope they emerge both alive and wiser. \nScott Clark knows that. He offered his child $20 to sneak up on a steer and climb on it. \nHe thought his child would get nowhere near it, but he was wrong. \nVery wrong. [Placeholder for https://www.facebook.com/scott.clark.1029/videos/vb.100003726812897/936061013194784/?type=2&theater video embed.] Some people on the internet are complaining this is child abuse , but Scott took to Facebook to reiterate that his son is OK. \n\"Just so everyone knows, this is his pet steer he hand feeds every day. And Asher is perfectly fine....And he's says he a tough ole cowboy!!\" \nLike I said. They do things differently down South. \nMy only issue is that he claims his son held on for another three seconds. \nNo chance. Asher is damn near airborne when the clip cuts out. No kid has that kind of grip strength.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:50:09.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
