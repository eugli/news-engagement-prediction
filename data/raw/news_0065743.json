The 33-year-old singer, who is expecting her first baby with boyfriend Liam Payne , was pictured cradling her rounded tummy for a new campaign for L'Oréal and The Prince's Trust. And it didn't take long for her supporters to take to social media to make their predictions about the child – from its due date and gender, through to potential baby names. The hot topic seems to be when Cheryl's baby will arrive, and whether or not it already has. A huge number of fans have taken to Twitter to speculate on the subject, with some convinced Cheryl has already given birth. \"I can't wait to see Cheryl's baby. She's due any day now… she could have already had it!\" one wrote. \nVIEW GALLERY Cheryl officially unveiled her baby bump this week in a new campaign photo \nExperts who have examined the latest bump photo estimate that Cheryl is around 34-36 weeks pregnant. Of course, it's not known exactly when the image was taken, but the baby's arrival does seem imminent. A source told the Metro : \"Cheryl is getting very excited to meet her baby. Her due date was mid to late March but she knows there is a two week window on either side, so her baby could be here literally any day now.\" The final countdown could also explain why Cheryl chose to stay at home on Wednesday rather than attend the Brits with 23-year-old Liam , who went solo on the night. \nSTORY: Cheryl shows off her baby bump in new video Cheryl and Liam Payne are expected to welcome their baby any day now \nWhen it comes to the sex of the baby, fans are pretty evenly split. A more pressing issue seems to be what the couple will name their firstborn. A firm front runner is 'Alfie' ; in an interview in August 2014, Cheryl revealed: \"I'd love kids. I'm obsessed with babies. Of course I've thought about baby names! A million times! I like Alfie for a little boy. I know that's what I was put on this earth to do. To be a mother.\" Liam, meanwhile, seems pretty set on the name 'Taylor'. \"It's pretty neutral for a boy or a girl. That's what I'm going to call my first child if I had children,\" he previously told Hits Radio . \nSTORY: Cheryl's mum army - the friends and family who will help her with the baby \nCheryl and Liam have remained resolutely silent throughout her pregnancy, and it remains to be seen whether or not they officially announce the baby's arrival on social media. Fans will of course be hoping for a birth announcement, along with a full photo of the newborn. But it's expected that the private couple will keep details to a minimum, and it they do choose to share an image it's unlikely to show the baby's face. Nevertheless, excitement remains at an all-time high. \"Liam and Cheryl's baby is gonna be blessed with beauty and a soulful singing voice,\" one follower tweeted. \"They'll be breaking hearts in 2035 for sure.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T10:56:57.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
