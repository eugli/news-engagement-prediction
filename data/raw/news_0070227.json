Throughout her weight-loss journey, during which she had a baby and shed a total of 80 pounds, she has Instagrammed many photos of herself wearing very little clothing to track her personal progress. Mallory also uses her snaps to encourage others to reach their own goals, whether it's weight loss or self-acceptance.\n Time: 1.5 years apart Lost: 30lbs, most of my issues with emotional eating Gained: Muscle, healthier hair & skin, more confidence in my abilities & knowledge in fitness and nutrition Done by: Loosely tracking macros & lifting weights, trying to be consistent over perfect, respecting my internal health I wish this picture could show the mental changes because they far outweigh the physical. #TransformationTuesday #KingsCoaching\nA post shared by Youtube ðŸŽ¥ Malzisfit (@mallorykingfitness) on Feb 21, 2017 at 10:53am PST\nWhile Mallory's followers generally shower her with encouragement and compliments, a few months ago, a commenter dropped a bomb that just didn't sit well with her: \"It was something like, 'Ewww, work on that cellulite,'\" she says, although the comment has since been removed.\nIf you follow @sundaymorningview you probably saw the image they posted of me that's very similar to this one except I was giving the middle finger to the haters that leave negative comments about my cellulite. The image blew up, getting an overwhelmingly positive response. Well, that image was deleted by @instagram this morning. This upsets me for two reasons 1) Why do thousands of posts go unremoved that show butts and boobs in WAY more vulgar ways than mine? Is it because my cellulite is offensive? Is it because I'm not trying to be sexy? Is it because I don't have the body type that is continuously shared on here? 2) Why are people so threatened by a woman unafraid of showing her body and speaking her mind? People used the excuse that their kid could see the photo. Don't let your kid on social media! No, that's not it. It's either people feel threatened by my fierceness or people are so brainwashed by media that a perfect pair of tits or butt is fine to flash but a body that's outside of the norm is offensive. Fuck that. Y'all can report my photos as much as you want, I'm gonna keep sharing them because the world needs more women unashamed of their bodies and unafraid to share their voice.\nA post shared by Youtube ðŸŽ¥ Malzisfit (@mallorykingfitness) on Feb 22, 2017 at 3:23pm PST\nNot willing to let the unsolicited critique bring her down, Mallory responded by posting the side-by-side photo below. On the left, she poses happily with her husband, Thomas. (\"He's loved me at 220 pounds, 120 pounds, and every single stage in between,\" she says.) On the right, she poses with her booty and the backs of her thighs on display to prove that when it comes to her cellulite, the only thing she's working on is lovin' it:\n ", "external_links": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-uploaded-from-ios-2-1487953479.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.564xh;0,0.219xh&resize=640:*", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ1QpPBBaIf/", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-uploaded-from-ios-2-1487953479.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.564xh;0,0.219xh&resize=480:*", "http://www.instagram.com/mallorykingfitness", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQyM8VxB5wL/", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-uploaded-from-ios-2-1487953479.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.564xh;0,0.219xh&resize=768:*"], "published": "2017-02-24T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:16:46.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
