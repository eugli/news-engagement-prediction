However, after some personal experiences, the three decided to get involved with paranormal investigations and see firsthand whether they could capture evidence of life after death or communicate with the spirits of the dead. Their personal backgrounds bring southern charm and civility to ghost hunting, where many paranormal investigators have natural reactions that require a heavy hand on the “bleep” button. \nYou might say that they’re the kind of boys you can bring home to mother. In fact, in this premiere episode of Ghost Brothers , Mass gets all dolled up to set up a convincing scene to try to “trigger” the ghosts of a family who were poisoned at the breakfast table by their own kin. [Image by iStock] What To Expect From Season 2 Of Ghost Brothers \nGhost Brothers premiered last year, with paranormal investigators Spratt, Mass, and Harvey hitting the road and testing some allegedly haunted houses for themselves, but putting their own unique twist on the genre. This paranormal show is a little cheeky but without the over-the-top humor of some shows that go overboard with the camp factor. Make no mistake, Ghost Brothers are serious about their investigations, but they like to have a good time, too. \nThis season features eight episodes and in addition to Thornhaven Manor, the Ghost Brothers visit the “Mill of Death” deep in the bayou of Louisiana, which sounds pretty creepy. In another episode, the Ghost Brothers travel to San Jose to investigate the legendary Winchester Mystery house with its maze of halls and stairways to nowhere. They’ll also investigate a haunted elementary school in Middletown, Ohio, and the “White Witch” of Rose Hall in Jamaica, among their other investigations for the season. \nTLC has cornered the Friday night frights market with its supernatural and paranormal programming, and Ghost Brothers takes over part of that Friday night paranormal niche starting Friday, March 10 at 9 p.m. ET. \n[Featured Image by TLC]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:13:09.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
