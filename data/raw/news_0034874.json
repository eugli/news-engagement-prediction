Fox News itself has yet to make a clear statement on anything that is going on, releasing a statement saying, “Neither Fox News nor 21st Century Fox has received a subpoena, but we have been in communication with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for months.” \nIt’s tough to say what all of this means for the network, if anything. But it seems safe to admit that this is yet another case of heartless liberals trying to take on America’s most beloved and most unbiased news network simply because its former CEO has been accused of sexually harassing employees. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:02:04.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
