So what? You can respect the office. The tradition. The reverence of our flawed but still-beautiful democratic system.” \nAlbom went on to suggest that President Donald Trump might end up canceling the ceremony. \n“If you were sitting in the White House and enough players were publicly telling you to stuff your invitation, you might end up saying, ‘What invitation?'” Albom wrote. \nRead the column here , via the Detroit Free Press \n[ image via screengrab ] \nFollow Joe DePaolo (@ joe_depaolo ) on Twitter \nHave a tip we should know?
