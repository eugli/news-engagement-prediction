Remembering Mike Ilitch Scott Boras: Mike Ilitch's passion 'made him a winner' \nMarian Ilitch continued to run Detroit's MotorCity Casino Hotel at the time of the succession plan's announcement, and by all indications that's still the case. Mike Ilitch was never involved in the casino because Major League Baseball rules prohibit interests in gambling enterprises while owning a team. \nOne unanswered question regarding the succession plan is how Chris Ilitch could hold both the Tigers and the casino once his mother dies. \nMike and Marian Ilitch together were among the wealthiest people on the planet with an estimated net worth of $6.1 billion , according to Forbes.com. \nThe Ilitch family is now undoubtedly hoping it will avoid the sort of estate problems that bedeviled heirs of the late billionaire William Davidson, who had owned Auburn Hills-based Guardian Industries as well as the Detroit Pistons, the WNBA's Detroit Shock and NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning. \nDavidson, who died at age 86 in March 2009 with a net worth estimate of more than $3 billion, had trusts drawn up for his wife, their children and grandchildren worth tens of millions of dollars each. \nBut the Internal Revenue Service surprised the family with a 2013 claim that over $2.7 billion was still due because of underpayments in estate taxes, gifts taxes, penalties and more. That amount was reportedly more than 10 times what the estate's accounting firm, Deloitte Tax LLP, initially calculated and paid, according to media reports. \nBill Davidson in a 2006 photo (Photo: KIRTHMON DOZIER, Kirthmon Dozier, Detroit Free Pr) \nThe IRS ultimately reached an agreement with Davidson's estate in 2015 for an additional tax payment of about $457 million. \nDavidson's estate then sued Deloitte Tax LLP, claiming that the firm recklessly botched the estate planning. The New York Supreme Court dismissed the case last year. Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
