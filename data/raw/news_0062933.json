GETTY \nThis latest scam comes just weeks after Chrome users were hit by another attack . \nA hack was recently discovered that can use the\"Autofill\" feature to allow cyber thieves to view user names, emails and even passwords. \nThe phishing attack, that can be used by hackers, appears fairly simple. \nWhen a Chrome user inputs personal information on a webpage, the Autofill option will fill in every data text box based on your previous entries - this even happens to boxes that may not be visible on the page that's open. \nThis data can then be sent straight to the hacker without the user ever knowing. \nTo make things even more worrying, it could also be possible to gain access to credit card numbers and security codes using the same method. \nThe hack only works if users are tricked into filling in the fake form but it's still concerning. \nTo stop any chance of the issue affecting users, Chrome, Safari and Opera fans can switch off the Autofill setting or double check before filling in any online forms. GETTY Google Chrome browser users are being targeted by a cyber campaign \nGoogle recently unveiled a major update to its popular Chrome browser on macOS, Windows, and Linux. \nThe new update boasts a dramatic speed increase – with page reloads now 28 per cent faster across all platforms. \nAccording to Google, \"When reloading a page, browsers will check with the web server if cached resources are still usable, a process known as validation. \n\"This typically results in hundreds of network requests per page issued to dozens of domains. \n\"On mobile devices, the high latency and transient nature of mobile connections mean that this behaviour can produce serious performance issues.\" \nGoogle Chrome 56 could solve some of these issues.
