He told the Star-Telegram that \"scouts have their opinions but, really, those guys aren’t the ones making the call.\" \nOn Wednesday's episode of Undisputed, Shannon Sharpe said that comparing Watson to Prescott is lazy. Deshaun Watson on comparisons to Dak Prescott Shannon: Why are black quarterbacks always compared to other black quarterbacks? \"It’s a lazy comparison. The only things these two have in common: They’re both black, and they both wear the No. 4 . Every time a black quarterback comes out, they compare him to other black quarterbacks. ‘Oh he’s like Cam, oh he’s like this, oh he’s like that.’ Why don’t them ever compare them to Warren Moon? You notice when white quarterbacks come out, they don’t get compared to Tom Brady or Peyton Manning or Drew Brees. It’s a lazy comparison.\" Matthew Emmons Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports Shannon: Dak wouldn't have been the same player in any other city \"If you wanted to say they were similar, judge them [as college players]. You can’t look at Deshaun Watson coming out of Clemson this year and look at Dak, what he did last year [in Dallas]. Do we look at Dak the same way if he’s starting for Cleveland ? If he’s starting for the Jets? Outside of Ben Roethlisberger, no quarterback has ever gone into a better situation [than Dak]. You remember when Ben went to Pittsburgh, the had The Bus [Jerome Bettis], Willie Parker, had a very good defense. A young James Harrison. A young Troy Polamalu. Ideal situation. Hines Ward, Antwaan Randle-El, a first-round tight end in [Heath] Miller.\" Dawson Powers Dawson Powers-USA TODAY Sports Shannon: Dak wasn't expected to be this type of player coming out of college \n\" Dak is a fourth-round draft pick , and he falls into the lap of a team that has the best offensive line in football, a No. 1 receiver, a tight end that has 1,000 catches, a very good slot receiver in Cole Beasley, and the highest-graded running back to come out since Adrian Peterson. But now you’re going to compare Deshaun Watson to Dak Prescott after what he did? He’s a fourth-round pick. Did Dak have a first-round grade on him? Deshaun Watson has a first-round grade on him. So if you want to compare, look at what they did against the closest thing to NFL competition . Deshaun Watson in two games against Alabama: 825 passing yards, seven touchdowns, one INT, 116 rush yards, another TD. Split 1-1, won the national championship. Dak Prescott, in two starts against Alabama - 0-2 I might add: 590 yards passing, two touchdowns four INTs and 96 rush yards. Stop with these lazy comparisons and do homework and study them throw-for-throw.\" Matthew Emmons Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports Shannon: They have a few common attributes, but play in entirely different situations \n\"Look, both are very athletic. Dak came into the league with that body, he has a grown-man body. Deshaun Watson needs to put on 10, 15 pounds . He has a wiry frame, and he needs to be able to play that position because unfortunately … you’re not going to the Cowboys. You’re not going to the Oakland Raiders, the teams that have the two best offensive lines in football. You’re not going there. They’re athletic. Arms are very similar, neither has a cannon, but they can make all the throws . I think, looking at them - I would have to go back and grade, look at every throw - but it looks to me, just watching the tape from TV, Deshaun looks like he’s a little more athletic than Dak. But it’s an unfair comparison, because you’re comparing Dak in Dallas to a college kid that’s coming into the draft . Compare them when they were coming out and you tell me if Dak Prescott and Deshaun Watson are similar.\" Matthew Emmons Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports Skip: Don't underestimate what Dak accomplished \n\"I am with you on your first point. I get tired, I get weary of the black quarterback to black quarterback comparisons, and I wish we could mix up the comparisons to say ‘well he reminds me of Tom Brady.’ If I, then, back off this and accept the question that Joy has asked us … do they compare at all? I find one area that they remind me of each other in, and that’s the intangibles area . They both have high clutch factor to me. .... Dak showed me on an even bigger stage this year, the Dallas Cowboys’ stage - and don’t underestimate … you dismiss Dak as ‘he fell into a great situation.’ I’m not sure that was a great situation ... He’s having to make up for a below-average defense game after game after game, with the pressure to live up to a three-time Pro Bowl quarterback that he’s replacing as a rookie starter in the National Football League.\" Tim Heitman Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:24:10.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
