Gayathiri Bose , a manager at a transport company who has a three-year-old child and a seven-month-old baby , said that she had filed a complaint with police. She said that she was \"humiliated\" and \"very traumatised\" by the experience and would explore legal action. She said police at Frankfurt airport were suspicious because she was carrying a breast pump but travelling without her baby . German police said, \"If a suspected explosive is detected at an air safety control point, the baggage and the person must be searched. The measures you have described for a breastfeeding mother are clearly not included.\" Bose, who was travelling alone, said she was on her way to board a flight to Paris last Thursday when she was stopped at the security screening station. She said that after her carry-on bag went through the x-ray machine, she was taken aside for questioning. \"(They had) an incredulous tone. 'You are breastfeeding? Then where is your baby? Your baby is in Singapore?',\" she said. They kept her passport and she was then led to a room by a female police officer for further questioning. Inside the room, \"She asked me to open up my blouse and show her my breast...She wanted me to show her by handexpressing a little.\" She said officials then cleared the pump before returning her passport, and she was allowed to board her plane. \"When they cleared me, I told them that this is not the way to treat someone. I said 'Do you know what you did to me, you made me show my breast'. I started to cry.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.
