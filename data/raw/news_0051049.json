Mary Jennings Hegar received a Purple Heart and the Distinguished Flying Cross With Valor after surviving a botched rescue operation in Afghanistan. (Handout) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Saturday, February 18, 2017, 7:20 PM \nMaj. Mary Jennings Hegar, covered in blood and hanging off an Army rescue helicopter, saw the muzzle flash of a Taliban fighter and laid down a dozen glorious rounds of return fire. \nIt was July 2009. Hegar’s own chopper had been shot down minutes earlier while rescuing three injured soldiers near the Afghan city of Kandahar. \nThe Air National Guard vet survived the botched rescue operation and was awarded a Purple Heart and the Distinguished Flying Cross With Valor. \nBut her most remarkable act of bravery came after she returned home, when the Texas native took a powerful stand against the military’s ban on women in combat. \nHegar tells her story of fighting sexual harassment within the ranks — as well as battling enemies abroad — in her forthcoming memoir, “Shoot Like a Girl: One Woman’s Dramatic Fight in Afghanistan and on the Home Front.” \nIt goes on sale March 7. “Shoot Like a Girl: One Woman’s Dramatic Fight in Afghanistan and on the Home Front” by Maj. Mary Jennings Hegar, goes on sale March 7, 2017. (Handout) \nIn 2003, Hegar quit the U.S. Air Force after three years when she was forced to submit to a cruel and abusive gynecological exam by a flight surgeon against whom no action was taken. \nAccepted into the Air National Guard in 2004, she trained to fly combat search and rescue HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters, serving two deployments in Afghanistan. \n10 injured after shooting breaks out at party in Tenn. armory \nBut it wasn’t until she joined the 129th Rescue Squadron, a unit that welcomed her as an equal, that Hegar found a home in the Air National Guard. \nOn July 29, 2009, Hegar was in the co-pilot’s seat of one of two Pave Hawks sent to rescue three American soldiers after their convoy was ambushed outside Kandahar. \nHer pilot brought their helicopter, Pedro 15, in for a landing. As the special ops soldiers burst out of the chopper, a bullet pierced the windshield. Maj. Mary Jennings Hegar's bravest moment was when she took a stand against the military's ban on women in combat. (Handout) \nBy then her chopper was in the air, positioned to give cover as the other copter swooped in for the rescue. \nBut the pilot of Pedro 16 refused to land. According to Hegar, he had lost his nerve. \nPedro 15 came to the rescue again, landing in a hail of gunfire but holding ground until the injured were onboard. Back in the air, flying low and fast, the chopper made it only a few miles before crashing. \nHegar grabbed her rifle and hit the ground next to a special ops soldier. One of the wounded soldiers demanded a gun be placed in his free hand, determined to fight to the death. Maj. Mary Jennings Hegar, accompanied by Marine Capt. Zoe Bedell (l.) explains, at a speaking engagement in San Francisco, that excluding women from a draft reinforces a stereotype that they are less capable than men and need to be protected. (Gigi Pandian/AP) \nStill, Pedro 16 refused to land. \nAs the Taliban converged, two Army Kiowas came to the rescue. Pedro 16 could hang back no longer. In the frantic scramble to get the injured into the second chopper, Hegar and her pilot were ordered onto the skids of a Kiowa. \nAs it rose, Hegar opened fire. \nHours later, at her debriefing, she braced herself to face accusations of being reckless for firing at the enemy from a rising chopper. \nShe recalls the pilot of Pedro 16, who had tried to lie his way out of his failure to act, eyeing the room, waiting for the moment when she’d be called out. Maj. Mary Jennings Hegar (l.) is presented the Purple Heart. (Handout) \nIt came when the Army officer piloting the Kiowa demanded to know who’d opened fire from his chopper. \nHegar raised her hand meekly, only as far as her ear. \n“F----n’ A, that was awesome,” he shouted. “I didn’t think we were going to make it outta there. You got their heads down so we could lift. Nice job.” \nAfter her heroic action, Hegar was fast-tracked to become an aircraft commander. Instead, she chose to quit full-time deployment. But in 2012, she became the lead plaintiff of four in an American Civil Liberties Union federal suit challenging the military ban on women in combat. \nThe ban was nominally lifted in 2013, but it wasn’t until 2016 that combat roles in all infantry units and special operations, including the Marines, were opened to women. \nThat day on the skid when Hegar opened fire on the Taliban, she played her own part in putting women on the front lines of the U.S. Army.
