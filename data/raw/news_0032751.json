What are antibiotics? Antibiotics are a broad class of drugs that work by inhibiting the function of bacterial cells. They do this by killing the bacteria or stopping them from reproducing â€“ but have no effect on viruses. They are used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia or skin infections", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:11:57.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
