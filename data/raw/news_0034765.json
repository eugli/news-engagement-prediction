The authors aim to understand the afterlife of scientific institutions and practices and the “aftertime” of scientific modernity and its attendant visions of progress and transformation. Straightforward scholarly work is juxtaposed here with altogether more experimental approaches to fieldwork and analysis, including interview fragments; brief, reflective essays; and a rich photographic archive. The result is an unprecedented view of the lingering traces of medical science from Africa’s past. Review Quotes Nancy Rose Hunt | University of Michigan, author of Colonial Lexicon and A Nervous State “This elegant, field-defining collection of sparkling originality excels as it curates, joining bits about five modern scientific sites in Africa with playful lines. The entire package suggests vital new affective methods for our times. These unruly junctions will productively challenge STS humanists, ethnographic historians, and students of global health practices. In our times of often ungainly, overtheorized immoderations, their innovative traces and tracing enable thinking deeply about relatively affluent African pasts. In these erstwhile spaces of scientific practice and development dreams, much remains not grim, rather bursting still with whims and guile.” Filip de Boek | author of Urban Now: City Life in Congo and Kinshasa: Tales of the Invisible City “There is, of course, a long history of anthropological writing on the subject of the future, but recently the discipline has witnessed a renewed interest in all kinds of futures—distant, near, and very often also irretrievably past. It is the latter kind, that of futures past, that is investigated in this wonderful book. Well informed and researched, and never dull, this edited volume explores various medical research stations and health centers across Africa, thereby offering a delicate contemplation of former ideas of future-oriented colonial science and medicine, and the ways in which they underpinned the ideologies of colonialist modernity and of progress that shaped these places and restructured the worlds around them. Combining various voices and modes of writing with original visual ethnographic explorations, this book reflects upon memory, nostalgia, and the passing of time, and as such it offers a delicate and often poetic and intimate but always insightful analysis of how the various times of the colonial past convert into the space of the now. A must read!” Simon Schaffer | University of Cambridge, author of Leviathan and the Air Pump: Hobbes, Boyle & the Experimental Life “In an astonishing series of reports, engagements, and reflections, this book offers a powerful and often brilliant evocation of the sites and populations of a group of ruined, abandoned, or transient scientific and medical establishments in west and east Africa. Layout and imagery, as well as intelligent analysis and story-telling, build up a compelling picture of modern ambitions and their fates. Without ever lapsing into nostalgia or condescension, Traces of the Future is a pathbreaking and exemplary project to help the objects and subjects of African scientific and medical worlds follow their own novel pathways.” For more information, or to order this book, please visit http://www.press.uchicago.edu Google preview here", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:44:43.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
