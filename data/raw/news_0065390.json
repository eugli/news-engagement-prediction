And it’s hard to disagree. Only one month into Trump’s presidency, many liberals are already feeling at least spiritually exhausted . And in no small part, that’s because the president routinely doles out misleading statements like candy on Halloween. Corden tried to count the number of fudged claims the president has made—but he met an unexpected challenge. Gone are the days when hosts like Corden could avoid politics: the Late Late Show host now addresses Trump on a regular basis, as do all of his contemporaries in late night. And on Wednesday, citing a Washington Post report that keeps a running tally of Trump’s false and misleading claims during his first 100 days in office, Corden said that during his first 34 days, Trump has released 133 false or misleading statements. Then he got an update via an imagined earpiece. “Sorry, it’s actually 134. It’s 135. It’s 137. Forget it; we’ll be here all night!” Corden joked, noting that 133 false claims over 34 days equates to four lies per day. “On the bright side, you can’t say that Trump isn’t getting anything done,” Corden joked. “The most shocking thing in this report is that it’s only been 34 days. How?! It feels like he’s halfway into his second term!” Jimmy Fallon made a similar joke when he brought back his Trump impression , last week, quipping, “We’ve made so much progress; in fact, if you ask any American, they’ll say that I’ve managed to make the last four weeks feel like four years. Four more weeks! Four more weeks! Four more weeks!” Then again, we can’t be too surprised by Trump’s apparent proclivity for falsehood, Corden reasoned. “Even the color of his skin is a lie!” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:03:05.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
