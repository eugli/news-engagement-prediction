'There was a pause in the music for a little while,' queried E!'s Ryan Seacrest. Replied Katy: 'Yeah that's called taking care of your mental health.' Not impressed: Fans did not like Katy's reference to Britney Spear's breakdown 'How'd that go?' he asked, leading to Katy's apparent reference to Britney. 'Fantastic! And I haven't shaved my head yet,' she joked. Britney famously shaved her head at the height of her fame in 2007, in the midst of a very public breakdown. 'Tragic' They felt the dig was not needed The 32-year-old also discussed her upcoming new album. 'I’m so proud of it. I think it’s a new era of me. I call it an era of purposeful thought,' she said of her political new track Chained to the Rhythm, which dropped on Friday. 'All of my songs have always had layers to them. I used to be kind of the queen of innuendos and I woke up and educated myself more and I think I’m maybe more the queen of subtext and I think it’s a song that starts conversations. And I think we need to listen to each other.' Who created that? Katy said her distinctive dress was by Tom Ford Peace out! The 32-year-old immediately apologized after swearing on live TV Speaking out: The politically minded singer urged her fans to come together Katy's bold appearance at the Grammys came after she said she had 'given up' caring what people think about her style. Admitting that she used to spend hours reading her followers' comments about her appearance and clothes on social media, she now only listens to her closest friends now. Moving on: Fans blasted Katy for 'throwing shade' at Britney's mental breakdown New music: The 32-year-old also discussed her upcoming new album, revealing one of her favourite new tracks is called Bon Appetit It's Katy! Her fans were delighted to see the pop star on the red carpet She said: 'I've given up on what people think about me. 'I have a great group of people around me that I listen to and value their opinions. 'I gave up scrolling down on the comments. Fashion is a way to express yourself. 'We can say we're funny or romantic or serious or sarcastic just by how we display ourselves.'
