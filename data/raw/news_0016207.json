Published:February 4, 2017 1:51 pm Arvind Kejriwal makes a typo and gets trolled \nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal who has actively campaigning for the ongoing elections in Punjab urged people of the state to vote positively. He has been tweeting on the proceedings of Aam Admi Party’s campaign in Punjab to keep his followers informed. On February 4, when Punjab goes to vote, he asked the people in the state to go out and vote. Punjab began voting for all 117 assembly constituencies in the state at 8 am. Kejriwal in his tweets in Hindi and Gurumukhi urged the people to exercise their voting rights to chose the best for their state. \nHowever, Kejriwal made an honest mistake. While tweeting in Hindi, he made a typo and wrote ‘white’ instead of ‘vote’. “सब लोग वोट डालने ज़रूर जाएँ। अपने पिंड के लोगों को भी ले जाएँ। और ईमानदार राजनीति के लिए वाइट दें। (Today is election day. Everyone must go to vote and take people of your village along with you and white (vote) for honest politics)” he wrote. \nTwitterati caught the mistake and got trolling. “he is most honest politicians vote bhi white me maang raha hey,” wrote a user. \nSample these.
