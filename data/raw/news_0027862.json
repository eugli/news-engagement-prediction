ADVERTISEMENT \nHe said the DOJ’s inaction on the killings was consistent with Aguirre’s statement that criminals are not part of humanity. \n“I agree with you Senator Trillanes that the deaths must be investigated. I am equally, if not more bothered, by it and so that’s the reason why I want the Secretary of Justice and I will ask him, for all the hard work we’re doing here, to please give an impartial, transparent investigation of all these deaths whether drug-related or perceived or alleged to be extrajudiclal (killings),” Legarda said. \n“You owe it to the Filipino people, and we, who have passed him or will pass him in the Commission on Appointments, if we will, owe it to the people.” \n“So I feel for you Senator Trillanes. I understand where you’re coming from and I share your concern for those deaths which are unexplained,” Legarda added. \nDespite Trillanes’ opposition, the panel endorsed Aguirre’s confirmation for plenary approval. The CA later unanimously approved the Secretary’s appointment. READ: CA panel recommends confirmation of Aguirre’s appointment \nInterviewed after his confirmation, Aguirre said the DOJ had no power to investigate crimes but he is proposing for the creation of a task force that would conduct such probe. \n“Dapat doon merong police agency na nag-i-investigate and file it with us. Hindi pwede yung mga piskal namin pupunta sa field para mag-investigate noong crime,” he said. \n(For that, there should be a police agency that would investigate on it and file it with us. Our prosecutors cannot be the ones to investigate in the field.) \nAguirre said his proposal to create a task force would have to be discussed yet in the Cabinet as it also needs the “imprimatur” of President Rodrigo Duterte.
