Wertkin, 40, joined the Akin Gump law firm in Washington last April after about six years at the U.S. Department of Justice, according to court documents filed in California where he was arrested wearing a wig and demanding $310,000 after handing over the secret court files to an undercover FBI agent.\nOver the course of the alleged payoff scheme, court files show, Wertkin upped his money demands to include travel costs and suggested being paid in untraceable bitcoins before finally agreeing to a cash handoff in the lobby of a Hilton Garden Inn in Cupertino, California.\n“My life is over,” Wertkin said at his Jan. 31 arrest, according to an affidavit from FBI Special Agent William Scanlon filed in San Francisco federal court Feb. 1 and unsealed Monday.\nWertkin’s attorney, Julia Jayne, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\nIn his alleged negotiations, Wertkin used a pseudonym and said it would be in the company’s interest to buy his copy of the lawsuit to get ahead of the investigation into its dealings, according to the court filings in his case, and offered up the first sheet of the suit to a company employee to launch discussions.\nThe employee later spoke with the FBI and agreed to record conversations with the man ultimately identified as Wertkin, court files state.\nThe firm name does not appear in the Wertkin case but is described in court files as a company headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, that provides technology security and is the target of still pending lawsuit that Wertkin allegedly shared.\nThe January 2016 lawsuit filed in San Francisco was brought under a federal law that allows whistleblowers to try to recover funds on behalf of the government by suing companies and remains secret while the Justice Department investigates claims that taxpayers were cheated. Wertkin, according to a biography cited by the FBI, worked extensively as a DOJ trial lawyer on that type of major fraud case brought under the False Claims Act.\nAfter his arrest, Wertkin made his first court appearance Feb. 1 and was released on $750,000 bond secured by a Dupont Circle condominium, according to court documents. He is set to be arraigned Feb. 22 on one count of contempt of court before U.S. Magistrate Sallie Kim in San Francisco.\nBenjamin J. Harris, a spokesman for Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, said in a statement that “we are shocked and deeply troubled by the conduct alleged in the charges filed against Mr. Wertkin … Immediately upon learning of these charges, we took swift action and Mr. Wertkin is no longer with the firm.”\nThe affidavit from the FBI agent alleges that a man later identified as Wertkin first raised a deal anonymously to the Sunnyvale company by leaving a call back number in a voice mail Nov. 30 with an employee.\nAfter arranging to get the first page of the lawsuit by regular mail — because the caller balked at using email — the employee in a series of recorded calls was given a price and detailed plans for the exchange of the full lawsuit and money, according to allegations detailed by the FBI agent in court records.\nThe Jan. 31 handoff was arranged by text with the employee who said a co-worker — who was the undercover FBI agent — would be the one bringing the cash and would be carrying a blue duffel bag to the hotel meeting, court files state.\nOn the morning of the meeting, the undercover agent was directed by text to sit in a chair that would have a newspaper resting on the seat where he then would be met by the person who allegedly had been in contact with the company, the FBI agent said in his affidavit.\n“Approximately 10 seconds after I sat down, a male approached me and held a copy of the complaint out and handed it to me,” Scanlon, the FBI agent, wrote in filings to the court. “At that point he was immediately arrested by FBI agents who were present in the hotel lobby.”\nThe man, in a wig, was identified as Wertkin, according to the accusations in the court filings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:23:18.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
