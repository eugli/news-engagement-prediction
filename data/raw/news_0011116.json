The 93-second video follows the excruciating life of ‘Lauren,’ a paralegal who works at a small law firm in Denver. Unfortunately, as narrator Sophia Bush tells viewers, Lauren is simply too busy to give birth, so she’s more than five years pregnant. Two-hundred sixty weeks and five days, to be exact. Neither Lauren nor her husband work for companies that offer paid maternity or paternity leave, so Lauren is doomed to holding in her baby and trying to navigate the working world with a giant toddler in her belly. Elevators are tricky, to say the least — as is getting out of your desk chair. \nThe video goes on to point out that the U.S. is the only country in the developed world that doesn’t have a national paid leave policy, and that a whopping 86 percent of employers in the nation do not offer paid family leave. So Lauren, the video concludes, is just going to continue holding the baby in. It also calls on people to visit the group’s website and support paid leave . Watch the full video below. \nRead the full story at The Huffington Post . \nRelated ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T21:15:58.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
