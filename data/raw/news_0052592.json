Shaw admitted after the match he was aware of the bet, though there was no suggestion he was being paid by anyone. \nWith the FA and Gambling Commission launching an investigation into the incident, Shaw resigned from the club. He was also part of the coaching staff. \nSutton coach Paul Doswell told Sky News on Tuesday, \"This decision was taken at board level. We felt we had to take very strong actions. The chairman spoke to him this afternoon and Wayne offered his resignation.\" \nHe continued, \"I'm devastated, the chairman is devastated. I have spoken to Wayne and the guy is in tears, crying down the phone. It is a very sad situation.\" \nDoswell added, \"This showed the club in a bad light, and to find that it was done in connection with some 8-1 bet exacerbates the situation.\" \nDoswell said that the team does not think other players were aware of the scenario. \nAccording to ESPN , the Gambling Commission was also launching an investigation to see if Sun Bets had violated a license agreement by placing such a bet. \nRichard Watson, the enforcement and intelligence director of the Gambling Commission, said in a statement, \"'Integrity in sport is not a joke and we have opened an investigation to establish exactly what happened.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:31:37.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
