It also admitted Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were handed the wrong envelope. \nIn a mishap that caused uproar and confusion, presenters Warren and Faye initially announced that romantic musical \"La La Land\", the presumed favorite for best picture, had won. \nThe gaffe is now considered to be the biggest mistake in the history of the Oscars. \nâ€” PwC LLP (@PwC_LLP) 27 February 2017 \nAs the casts of both films stood awkwardly on stage, Beatty explained he had been given the wrong envelope to open. MUST READ Oscars 2017: The winners and the diversity \nIt was the first time in living memory that such a major mistake had been made at the Academy Awards, Hollywood`s biggest night. It even eclipsed the prior three hours of a show peppered with jokes about U.S. President Donald Trump. \n\"Is that the craziest Oscar moment of all time?\" Stone, who won the best actress Oscar for her \"La La Land\" role as a struggling actress, told reporters backstage \"It`s a very strange happening for Oscar history.\" \n\"Moonlight,\" about a young boy struggling with poverty and his sexuality in Miami, also brought a supporting actor Oscar for first timer Mahershala Ali, a best adapted screenplay statuette. \nViola Davis won for her supporting role as a long suffering housewife in African-American family drama \"Fences.\" MUST READ Oscars 2017: Jimmy Kimmel cracks Trump jokes as 89th Academy Awards \nThe recognition for both the actors and their films made a stark contrast to the 2016 Academy Awards when no actors of color were even nominated. \n\"Moonlight\" producer Adele Romanski said she hoped the movie would inspire \"little black boys and brown girls and other folks watching at home who feel marginalized.\" \n\"La La Land\" went into the Oscars with a leading 14 nominations and emerged with six, including for its score and theme song \"City of Stars.\" \"La La Land\" director Damien Chazelle, 32, became the youngest person to ever win a best director Oscar. \nElsewhere, \"Manchester by the Sea\" star Casey Affleck was named best actor, winning his first Oscar despite 2010 sexual harassment allegations that resurfaced during awards season. Affleck denied the allegations which were settled out of court. \n\"Man, I wish I had something better and more meaningful to say...I`m just dumbfounded that I`m included,\" said Affleck, who played a heart-broken father in the movie. \nEarlier in the show, Trump had been the butt of numerous jokes, capping an awards season marked by fiery protests by celebrities at his policies. \nOscars host Jimmy Kimmel fired off political zingers and even tweeted at the Republican president, getting no immediate response. \nSeveral celebrities wore blue ribbons on Sunday in support of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) advocacy group that worked to get Trump`s bid to ban travelers from seven majority Muslim nations blocked in U.S. courts. But for the most part, speeches at the ceremony were mild or made general pleas for tolerance rather than directly attacking Trump. \nIranian director Asghar Farhadi was an exception. His drama \"The Salesman\" was named best foreign language film but Farhadi, boycotted Sunday`s ceremony because of the Trump`s travel ban. \nIn a speech delivered on his behalf by Iranian-American space expert Anousheh Ansari, Farhadi said his absence was due to \"an inhumane law that bans entry into the U.S... Dividing the world into the `us` and `our enemies` categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war.\" \n(With Reuters inputs) First Published: Monday, February 27, 2017 - 15:52 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:34:23.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
