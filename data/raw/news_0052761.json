An artist's rendering of the new stadium being buit by East Aurora School District. (Cordogan, Clark and Associates) Privacy Policy \nEast Aurora School District 131 officials are looking to recognize district veterans with the high school's new stadium. \nKurt Becker, East Aurora High School football coach, proposed naming the new stadium along the lines of Roy E. Davis Field at East Aurora Veterans Memorial Stadium, a name designed to both recognize the old stadium's namesake and honor veterans. He said he is also working with a committee of veterans to create a memorial at the stadium. \n\"I would like to preserve our past, because East Aurora was built on tradition and history,\" he said. \nThe new, $7.1 million stadium is among more than $70 million worth of construction and related costs ongoing in the district, which includes an addition and renovations at East Aurora High School. It is expected to be completed in July. \nThe old Roy E. Davis Field, torn down in recent months, was built in the 1920s. Becker described measures he said he has heard the district took to recognize veterans at that stadium's dedication. \nBecker said he envisions the new stadium, along with the other construction projects in the district, having the ability to change East Aurora's image. \nVisitors should be able to interact with the new stadium, rather than just sit in the bleachers, he said. Though the veterans committee, which he said includes a staff member from the district's Naval Junior ROTC program, is working to design the memorial, Becker said it could include plaques or pavers engraved with names and he would like to see an eternal flame incorporated. \nBecker anticipates fundraising to pay for the memorial.

(Sean King / The Beacon-News) \nBoard members spent much of their discussion about the stadium weighing a board policy on the logistics of naming facilities, but said they were in favor of recognizing veterans. They said before formally naming the stadium they would determine whether the district's official name includes East Aurora, Aurora East, or other wording. Board members John Laesch and Kirsten Strand said students should have input in the naming. \nThe student board member who was in attendance at the meeting spoke in favor of recognizing veterans with the stadium, saying many students have family in the military and the move \"reflects the whole school.\" \nBecker later outlined other proposed features of the new stadium as well, such as a \"Tomcat Walk\" to celebrate the district and alumni. \n\"It's not a football stadium,\" he said. \"It's everybody's stadium.\" \nHe is expected to bring the proposal before the board again. \nTwitter @srfreish ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:35:42.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
