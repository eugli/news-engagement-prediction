This was evident on Tuesday, as well as on the Pride’s season opener on Saturday at Bucknell, where Parrella had five goals and two assists, earning Colonial Athletic Association Rookie of the Week honors. \n“The older girls have made it so easy for me to come into the game and feel comfortable,” Parrella said. “As a freshman, it’s always so scary getting into the first game with girls bigger than you, faster than you. Having them have my back is one of the best ways to make it comfortable on the field.” \nParrella scored two of her goals during a 6-0 run early in the first half that put the Pride ahead 6-1. Wagner responded with four consecutive goals to cut its deficit to 6-5, before Carlee Ancona, Shapiro and Conto scored for Hofstra. Hofstra Hofstra vs. Wagner \nThe Pride’s early surges were fueled in part by an edge on draw controls. Hofstra won 10 of the 16 draw controls in the first half. \n  \n\n“It all comes from the people on the circle, so as long as the people on the circle are doing their jobs, draw controls are my favorite things to do,” said Conto, who had a team-high five for the game. \nHofstra (2-0) allowed a goal before halftime and another less than two minutes into the second half as Wagner drew within 9-7, but responded with another 3-0 run and never saw its lead fall below four for the remainder of the game. \nLauren Ednie scored three goals for Wagner (0-2), which is the first of six opponents Hofstra will face that reached the NCAA Tournament last year. \nAncona and Lexi Lenaghan both added two goals and Alexa Mattera had one for the Pride. In addition to leading the team in points, Parrella also had two caused turnovers and a game-high four ground balls. \n“She’s going to continue to grow,” Smith said. “If she keeps putting up these numbers, everyone in the country is going to know who Alyssa is.” Enter your email address to subscribe to Newsday's Sports Now newsletter sign up", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:50:21.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
