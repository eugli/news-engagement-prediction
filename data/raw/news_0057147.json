This week, Jenelle shared her flat tummy on Instagram , and we're pretty impressed! \nOf course, the photos were meant to advertise the tea she's always posting about, but we can't ignore how awesome this mama looks. She's always been open about how determined she is to whip her post-baby body back into shape though, so we shouldn't be surprised at how quickly she's pulling it off. A post shared by Jenelle Evans (@j_evans1219) on Feb 21, 2017 at 4:03pm PST \nThis kind of progress and a newborn? Not too shabby, girl! \nMore from CafeMom: Jenelle Evans Shows Off a Closeup of Her New Engagement Ring \nAnd although Jenelle has obviously been working hard at getting fit, it's pretty clear that her main focus is on Ensley. Her Instagram has been a flood of photos and videos of her very first daughter -- not that we're complaining. We can't get enough. \nBesides, now that she and David are engaged, we have a feeling she'll be sweating for the wedding, too. We can't wait to see what else is in store for her this year. It seems like it's going to be one of her best yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:30:55.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
