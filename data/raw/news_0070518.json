PA Archive/PA Images \nSeats on seven Tube lines never get washed with shampoo, surprising new figures have shown. \nNearly five million people use the London Underground every year but only passengers on three Tube lines are lucky enough to sit on seats which are properly cleaned. \nAccording to figures from Transport for London, seats on the Bakerloo, Victoria and Central Lines are washed once every six months to a year. \nFor the District, Jubilee, Northern, Circle, Piccadilly, Metropolitan and Hammersmith and City Lines, passenger seats are never shampooed. Revealed: the £8bn plan for south-east London's supersized district \nThe data was released as part of a Freedom of Information request. \nDespite the lack of a proper shampoo wash, seats are brushed and carriages are given a basic clean every night at the depot. \nThe poles which Londoners grip while standing up on the Tube are spot cleaned every night and wiped down every two to three days. \nOn the Victoria Line seats are washed every 24 weeks, every 36 weeks on the Bakerloo and at least once a year on the Central. \nSeats on the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly Lines are vacuumed and floors are mopped every night. (PA Archive/PA Images) \nAcross the rest of the Underground network, floors are mopped at every two to three days. \nTfL spent £8.46 million on cleaning Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly trains in 2015 and 2016. \nFor the Bakerloo, Central, Victoria and Metropolitan, Circle, Hammersmith and City and District Lines, TfL spent £11.61 million on cleaning. \nA spokesperson for Transport for London said: “We’re committed to providing the best possible service on London’s transport network. \n“Although cleaning regimes vary across the Underground, each line has a rigorous cleaning schedule in place, for both the interior and exterior of the trains, to provide a pleasant environment for our customers.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:47:57.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
