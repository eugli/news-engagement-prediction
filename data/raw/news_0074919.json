Coming off their first season of not making the playoffs since 2010, the Broncos will have 10 selections in the NFL draft, including five of the first 127 selections. \nSee the team’s official list of draft picks below: \n1. Round 1: No. 20 overall (Natural) 2. Round 2: No. 51 overall (Natural) 3. Round 3: No. 82 overall (Natural) 4. Round 3: No. 101 overall (Compensatory) 5. Round 4: No. 127 overall (Natural) 6. Round 5: No. 177 overall (Compensatory) 7. Round 6: No. 203 overall (via Titans) 8. Round 7: No. 238 overall (Natural) 9. Round 7: No. 252 overall (Compensatory) 10. Round 7: 253 overall (Compensatory) \nThe team’s natural fifth round selection was traded to the New England Patriots last season in exchange for tight end A.J. Derby, who is under contract through the 2018 season. The team’s natural sixth round selection was traded to the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for fellow tight end Vernon Davis in 2015. Davis left in free agency the following year. \nDenver received Tennessee’s natural sixth round selection last April through a draft day trade. The Titans selected LeShaun Sims and Kalan Reed with picks received from Denver and the Broncos selected Andy Janovich with one of the two selections they received from Tennessee. \nIt’s worth noting that Denver’s compensatory selections can be traded this year (comp picks could not be traded in previous years). The Broncos also have the “Mr. Irrelevant” selection this year, No. 253 overall. Denver has never selected Mr. Irrelevant before. \nThe 2017 NFL draft will begin on Thursday, April 27.
