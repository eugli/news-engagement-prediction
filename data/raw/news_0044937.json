C. \nSome of its notable North Texas projects include Bell Helicopter Global Headquarters in Fort Worth, The Drever development at 1401 Elm St. in downtown Dallas and the Statler Hotel renovation on Commerce Street. \nMerriman said expansion of the company's owners will help ensure future success. \n\"Some really good firms through the years didn't have that next generation ready when they needed them,\" he said. \"Most of these people we are promoting are between 30 and 40 and have been with us since their late 20s.\" \nMerriman Anderson/Architects has expanded its ownership group by seven principals.
