Gladys Berejiklian's priorities as Premier \nGladys Berejiklian has made clear her plans as NSW's 45th Premier –- but can she pull them off? \nBut she acknowledged the \"angst\" that mergers have caused in parts of NSW and declared: \"I will fix this\". \n\"We know for a fact that this is an issue which has got lingering concerns in part of our community, which is why it's a topic of conversation,\" she said. SHARE Premier Gladys Berejiklian says a decision on council mergers is imminent Photo: Bevan Shields \n\"I've indicated I'm willing to address those concerns across the Liberals and Nationals and obviously across the community. And that's what we're doing. No decision has been arrived at. No change in policy at this stage.\" \nFairfax Media reported on Wednesday night that Ms Berejiklian was considering offering plebiscites to councils that have not yet agreed to amalgamate. Advertisement \nDoing so would raise questions about the future of councils that have already been amalgamated, and whether residents in those areas would be offered the chance to elect to de-amalgamate. \nBut the uncertainty about the issue has thrown fuel onto what had already been a highly contentious policy in some parts of the state. Opponents of council mergers were hopeful on Thursday about the prospects of a significant change in policy. \nKeith Rhoades, the president of industry group Local Government NSW, said he had hour-long meetings with both Nationals leader and Deputy Premier John Barilaro and Local Government Minister Gabrielle Upton on Wednesday. His organisation has argued strongly against forced mergers. \n\"I found them to be very receptive,\" Mr Rhoades said of Mr Barilaro and Ms Upton. \"Very open to discussion, very willing to discuss ideas and proposals. \n\"But I don't want to break trust with them because we are still in a very delicate stage.\" \nPhil Jenkyn from the advocacy group Save Our Councils Coalition said the Liberal Party had \"damaged themselves unbelievably\" by forcing through mergers. \n\"They should have given everyone a say at the start,\" Mr Jenkyn said. \nNevertheless a back-down on mergers would generate its own political difficulties. \nThe executive director of the Sydney Business Chamber, Patricia Forsythe, said any retreat from council amalgamations would be \"extremely disappointing\". \n\"It's impossible to unscramble an egg and whatever they do will have consequences,\" Ms Forsythe said. \n\"The future of Sydney requires strong local government, it requires them to have adequate resources and infrastructure to manage the growth and none of that has changed,\" she said. \nThe government has already committed hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to merged councils. Should councils ever be de-merged, that process would cost many millions more. \nMs Berejiklian's reconsideration of the issue follows a meeting of the government leadership group including Ms Berejiklian and Mr Barilaro on the issue. \nAsked on Thursday if Mr Barilaro – who is pushing for a halt to mergers in regional areas – was \"trying to undermine her\" Ms Berejiklian responded that they \"have really established a lot of trust\". \nBut the prospect of allowing councils to offer plebiscites to residents to decide whether to amalgamate or even de-amalgamate has infuriated many Liberal councillors who went along with the government's merger agenda. \n\"After doing the right thing by the party and local government state wide, to let these recalcitrant councils off the hook is a betrayal of good councillors across the state,\" said a senior Liberal local government source. \nAnother source said plebiscites on the future of new councils may not occur until 2020. \nGreg Wright, the administrator of Bayside Council, formed five months ago after the amalgamation of Botany and Rockdale, said separating the two would be difficult. \n\"Already we are at a point where we are starting to integrate systems and people and locations, and that would be difficult to unravel,\" Mr Wright said. \n\"To my way of thinking there's no doubt… greater levels of strategic capacity are achievable in larger councils, particularly in the metropolitan area,\" he said. \nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the revelations about Ms Berejiklian considering plebiscites show the government \"is at war with itself.\" \n\"We see leaks from Ms Berejiklian's most senior cabinet colleagues designed to force her hand. The cabinet hasn't even met for the first time and we see these leaks\". \nMr Foley accused Mr Barilaro of \"batting against his own government, out on his own freelancing in an attempt to save his skin in his own electorate.\" \nHe accused Mr Barilaro of leaking against his then leader, Troy Grant, on the aborted greyhound racing ban and now on mergers. \n\"This bloke's a cancer at the heart of Ms Berejiklian's government,\" he said. \nMr Foley has promised that if elected he would allow residents in merged councils plebiscites to decide if they wished to de-merge.
