That's about six hours of drama in all. \nHarris said: \"There could hardly be a more timely moment to look at the collapse of the Roman Republic, a political institution destroyed by ambition, money and unscrupulous demagogues who treated the laws with contempt.\" 'Curious fact' \nImperium's director Gregory Doran agreed the stories resonated with contemporary events. \nAnd Harris, he noted, is a former political correspondent with inside knowledge of \"the corridors of power\". \nThe plays will be written by Mike Poulton, who has plenty of experience of adapting books for the stage. \nHis most recent work for the RSC was his adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, which tell the story of Henry VIII's adviser Thomas Cromwell. \nHarris, who also wrote Fatherland, Enigma, Pompeii and The Ghost, said: \"It's a curious fact that Shakespeare in his Roman plays gives hardly any lines to Cicero, arguably the greatest orator in history. \n\"So I'm especially delighted that through the RSC his voice will at last be heard on stage in Stratford.\" \nImperium: The Cicero Plays will run at the RSC's Swan Theatre from 16 November to 10 Feb 2018. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T16:35:45.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
