Royal Navy sailor found not guilty of raping woman as she slept \nNow Transport for London has released details of how often they clean trains on each of the lines. \nResponding to a Freedom of Information request, they told us that seats on the District, Jubilee, Northern, Circle, Piccadilly, Metropolitan and Hammersmith and City lines are never shampooed. \nThe only lines where seats get a wash are the Bakerloo, Victoria and Central (and even then it only happens every six months to a year). \nDon’t panic, as the carriages do get a basic clean every night when they go back to the depot. \nThe seats are hoovered regularly, and covers are removed and replaced if they are soiled. How often are we talking? \nThe Bakerloo, Central, Victoria, Metropolitan, Circle, District and Hammersmith & City: \nSeats are brushed every night on the underground sections of the network. They are vacuumed on a 21 day rotation during a longer clean, when train poles and floors also get a going over. \nThe Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines: \nSeats are vacuumed every night. Floors are given a general mopping every night and get a proper polish every 17 to 23 days. \nLitter will be removed every night on all lines. \nFloors across the network are swept every night, and are mopped every two to three days. Man hammered nail into dog's skull before burying it alive \nYou can put down your hand sanitisers for now as poles on the network are spot cleaned nightly and are wiped down every two to three days. \nWhile it’s not advisable to hang off the outside of a train James Bond style, those who do will be pleased to know that train exteriors are cleaned every three days, provided it isn’t too cold outside. Trains on the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly get put through a ‘train wash’. Train floors get a proper polish every few weeks (Picture: Getty. Graphic: Myles Goode) \nTime Out took a rubber mallet out onto the network a few years ago to see exactly how dirty things could get. \nTheir unscientific experiment involved bashing seats on all the different lines to see which one threw up the most dust. \nThe cloud billowing up from the Jubilee line shows what years of no shampooing really looks like: \nA TfL spokesperson said: ‘We’re committed to providing the best possible service on London’s transport network. \n‘Although cleaning regimes vary across the Underground, each line has a rigorous cleaning schedule in place, for both the interior and exterior of the trains, to provide a pleasant environment for our customers.’ \nThey did not provide details for the Waterloo line. \nAdditional reporting by Dianne Apen-Sadler.
