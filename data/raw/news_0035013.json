Sometimes, conceiving can take multiple rounds of treatments.\nFor baby Blaise, Juvarya and her husband Shaun say they spent somewhere around six figures for their treatments. After four years, five rounds of treatment and a donor egg, Veltkamp was able to conceive.\n\"Everytime we needed a treatment, we had to open up our pocketbook,\" she said. \"That is out of reach for most people.\"\nFour years and five IVF treatments later, Jurvarya Veltcamp was able to conceive baby Blaise. (Christer Waara/CBC)\nThe couple took out loans and used savings to pay for the treatments. Husband Shaun took on extra projects at work.\n\"You're already going through a lot of emotional stress and the physical burden of the treatments and then you add this,\" she said.\nShaun said the most challenging thing are the misconceptions around infertility.\n\"The biggest thing is that it's such a taboo subject and nobody wants to speak about it. They feel like it makes them feel inferior or like there's something wrong with them which can lead to depression and anxiety,\" he said.\n\"There's nothing harder than wanting to start a family and not being able to.\"\nOther provinces help with IVF Only a few provinces have funding options for those looking for fertility treatments.\nManitoba and New Brunswick have tax credits for fertility treatments. Quebec became the first province to fully cover fertility treatments in 2010, but drastically cut back the services it would cover in late 2015 . Ontario announced it would publicly fund up to one cycle of fertility treatments in 2015.\nIn a statement to CBC News, a spokesperson from B.C.'s Ministry of Health acknowledged many people have difficulty conceiving and pointed out B.C.'s health plan covers a variety of medical procedures to identify causes of infertility. She also pointed out the cost of artificial insemination performed at a doctor's office is covered under the plan.\n\"British Columbia does not cover in-vitro fertilizations (IVF). Clinics offering in-vitro fertilization are private clinics and as such, the Ministry of Health has no authority over the costs charged for treatment,\" she continued.\n\"Our focus is to insure effective, medically necessary procedures, while keeping health care costs sustainable.\"\nVeltcamp said she understands not everything can be covered by the province but believes there should be patient input into how that decision is made.\n\"When you're going through infertility, your life is on hold. We're on the other side and we want the journey to be easier for everyone else.\"\nWith files from Tanya Fletcher", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CBCtanya"], "published": "2017-02-13T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:29:28.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
