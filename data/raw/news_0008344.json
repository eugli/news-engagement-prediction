The Cobourg, Ont. boy died by suicide in 2014 after years of being bounced around between various schools and health agencies.\nAn initial decision regarding the inquest had already been made by regional supervising coroner Dr. Paul Dungey last year, but the Petrellas had hoped a plea to chief coroner Dr. Dirk Huyer would change that.\nIn a letter sent to the family’s lawyer last Friday, Huyer confirmed that after reviewing Dungey’s decision, no inquest will be held. Huyer’s decision is final.\n“I agree with Dr. Dungey’s determination that there would not be a benefit to the public being further informed of the circumstances of the death through an inquest,” Huyer said in the letter, obtained by the Star.\n  “Please note that this opinion is not meant to imply either approval or criticism of the care Chazz received.”\nHe said he agreed with Dungey that there had already been “significant media attention” of Chazz’s case, thereby making it known to the public and the mental health agencies involved, and that efforts are already underway to improve the system.\nAs part of his review, Huyer had met with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Children and Youth Services to learn more about what they were doing to improve services. \n“The issues I have identified in this case are known to the public, known to those responsible for fixing things, and they have a plan for doing that,” Huyer told the Star in an interview.\n“So all of that leads me, in my view of things, to not proceed with an inquest . . . All of us, including me, want this system to be fixed and we’d love to see it fixed now, but it’s a very complex series of issues, and I believe that the ministries are working thoroughly to move forward with the plan.”\nThe Petrellas told the Star last year that they believe Ontario’s mental-health system failed them horribly. They argued their concerns should have been probed in a public forum and addressed through recommendations from an inquest jury to prevent future similar deaths.\nIn a response sent to Huyer this week, the Petrellas’ lawyer, Julie Kirkpatrick, said her clients are “extremely disappointed” and that the province has missed “a significant opportunity” to learn from what she described as systemic failures that led to Chazz’s death.\n“As you are aware, my clients strongly believe that a reliable factual foundation for meaningful recommendations can only be achieved in Chazz’s case through a public inquest under the Coroners Act,” Kirkpatrick wrote.\n“And that what is needed is a close look by a jury of individuals who have not emerged from, worked within, or become invested in the very system that failed Chazz and his family.”\nProvincial Advocate for Children and Youth Irwin Elman also expressed outrage with Huyer’s decision.\n“To say that I am disappointed in this missed opportunity to improve the lives of children with mental health challenges in this province is a great understatement,” Elman said in a statement.\n“The public has more than expressed an interest and desire to see children and youth in similar circumstances receive the supports they need to thrive and fulfill their potential.”\nThe youngest of five children, Chazz’s behaviour changed dramatically as he moved through elementary school. He had fits of rage at the smallest problems, and he would swear and throw things. Sometimes he would go missing for days.\nWithin the span of about two years, he bounced around between different classrooms, child and family services in Peterborough, a rural treatment centre and then back home. \nThere was never a clear diagnosis, and the boy never got the comprehensive testing he should have received as soon as his behaviour began to spiral out of control, his family says.\nIn August 2014, he hanged himself from a tree in the family’s backyard. He had been taken to the hospital twice the night before, after punching a wall and injuring his hand. He was given a sedative and sent home.\nDungey, the regional supervising coroner, agreed with the family last year that Chazz was given twice the daily adult dose of the sedative, which is not recommended for people under 18. The family continues to question whether that played a role in his suicide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:08:38.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
