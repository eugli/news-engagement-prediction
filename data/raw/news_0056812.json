There’s something new bubbling under. It’s hard to get your head around such a big subject.”\nHe added: “The challenge with Trump would be… something so abhorrent that walks on two legs and is a human being, you have to explore where his foibles come from.”\nView photos\nThe esteemed filmmaker won Best Film at the V05 NME Awards (Copyright: James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock) More The British broadcaster has already experienced success with his previous documentaries, most recently being awarded the Best Film accolade at the NME Awards for last year’s ‘My Scientology Movie.’\nLouis thanked Tom Cruise as he collected his trophy last week, saying: “Thank you, simmer down. A big, big thank to NME, to everyone who voted, a big thank you to my wife, who’s had a baby while I was making this film. He’s now two and a half years old.\n“But there’s one person out there that made this film possible and that is Tom Cruise. He wouldn’t be in the film but Tom if you’re out there please call my agent, let’s do an expose, I’ve already got a title – My Scientology Sequel.”\nBrilliant. We’ll stock up on the popcorn.", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dT9baOtO7rBPMhy7WBjS7w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/d303649d17e0658ef560ed48e59d6e0b);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dT9baOtO7rBPMhy7WBjS7w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/d303649d17e0658ef560ed48e59d6e0b", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jsxqDqEi7v7OG4cPsOIA5A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/f3df563aacc0a0f2334f4777fcf4d9bb", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jsxqDqEi7v7OG4cPsOIA5A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/f3df563aacc0a0f2334f4777fcf4d9bb);", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/odMXIBRMiYeSYAFaj9EuOQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/cd1da6dfc770c046b405e31b53f39f8b", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/odMXIBRMiYeSYAFaj9EuOQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/cd1da6dfc770c046b405e31b53f39f8b);", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif"], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:04:29.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
