She told them she had Seaira and they were both doing well, but she wouldn’t meet with officers. A family member had contact with Mikalosh in the evening that same day, but again, she refused to meet with police.\nPolice believe they could be travelling in western Saskatchewan near North Battleford or Saskatoon, or in Alberta.\nRCMP believe Mikalosh is driving a grey 2001 Ford Taurus with a Manitoba licence plate, number GVD 275.\nSeaira is described as 2 ft., 9 in. (84 centimetres) tall and 20 lbs. (nine kilograms). Mikalosh is described as about 5 ft., 6 in. (168 cm) and about 120 lbs. (54 kg), with short brown hair.\nPolice said they have not issued an Amber Alert because at this point they have no reason to think that Seaira is in any danger of imminent physical harm or death.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:47:30.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
