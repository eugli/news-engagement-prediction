Last night, she dropped her Joanne World Tour merchandise collection. Pieces include screen-printed T-shirts boasting images of Gaga herself, dad hats, and gold necklaces. As for the other clothes in the mix? Those aren’t a part of Lady Gaga’s merchandise line. Instead, the artist seems to have her eye on Ukraine: Among the tour tees are looks by Ukrainian designers, such as LVMH Prize–nominated designer Anton Belinskiy , Masha Reva , Yulia Yefimchuk , Zirochka Ukraine , Yana Chervinska, and the underground label Drag & Drop . Though it might seem unusual, the injection of Ukrainian fashion wasn’t entirely random. The singer collaborated with the creative studio Lobster Eye and the merchandising company Bravado, which tapped Ukrainian talents like photography team Synchrodogs, Kiev-based stylist and Zirochka Ukraine designer Dariia Lagenberg, and the up-and-coming modeling agency Cat-B to produce the lookbook. Synchrodogs, made up of the duo Taniia Oldyork and Roman Noven, has long been a major creative force in Kiev and has gained international recognition for their otherworldly, warped style. (In fact, the earrings on the models are from Oldyork’s own jewelry line, Crystaltania .) According to Oldyork, the concept for the lookbook was inspired by Ukraine itself. “We felt that Ukrainian landscape would be a perfect fit for the lookbook as it is so different every time, sometimes raw and messy, still full of harmony, strong, even intense. We like combining things that look like they should never be together,” she wrote to Vogue.com . As for Lagenberg, she also had a bit of Kiev in mind when styling the collection. “I was inspired by girls being forever young,” she wrote to Vogue.com . “And Kiev residents and everything here I see.” The choice to use Ukrainian-based teams comes at a time when Eastern Europe fashion is having quite the moment . But the country’s growing fashion industry isn’t completely foreign to Lady Gaga: The artist wore a hat by Ksenia Schneider on the cover of her “Dope” single release in 2013. Though, no word yet if she’ll be greeting Kiev’s Little Monsters on her tour.
