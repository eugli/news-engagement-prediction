ROSS GIBLIN/FAIRFAX NZ \nAngus Little, 9, who is undergoing chemotherapy, is delighted Wellington Hospital has been flooded with donations since the PlayStation 4 he used at the ward was stolen. \nAt last count 12 console and 15 games had been donated, and the Wellington Hospitals Foundation had been given $5000. One man in the UK had bought a PlayStation online from his hospital bed, and had it posted straight to Wellington. \nREAD MORE: \nAngus said he had not expected so many people to reach out, but he was very grateful â€“ thanking all those who had donated. Ross Giblin/Fairfax NZ \nAngus Little is happy again after a flood of donations. \nIt was the biggest response the foundation had ever seen, chairman Bill Day said. \n\"We just want to thank everyone who has donated PlayStations, games and money.\" \nOnce the donations had been tallied, staff would sit down and work out what was needed where on children's wards across the hospital. \nAngus' mother, Wendy Little, said she was in tears on Saturday reading comments on social media of people sharing their own stories. \n\"It struck a nerve that somebody thought it was OK to steal from a children's oncology ward.\" \nThe gaming community alone \"really, really went to town\" and kept spreading the word of the theft. \nAngus said he had to have one treatment without the PlayStation to distract him, and it made the three-hour treatment feel much longer. \nHis mother said he was delighted there would be more consoles to go around, meaning children would not have to wait for their turn while getting treatment. \n\"It takes their mind off what's happening, sometimes they're confined to the bed,\" Little said. \nHis school, Rata St School in Naenae, had also jumped into gear and was organising a lunchtime sausage sizzle, principal Dave Appleyard said. It was originally intended to raise money for another PlayStation, but now that would go to his family so they could decide how to use it. \nWhile excited to see how kind others had been, Angus still had a message for whoever had stolen the console: \"That was a bad choice, because all those kids wanted to play on it.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T12:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T07:48:58.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
