British MPs want more perks on their taxpayer-funded credit cards \n“Far too many people have been put in here as a sort of personal reward,” Tebbit told the BBC. \n“You wouldn’t have imagined Mrs. Thatcher wanting to give a peerage to Denis Thatcher’s tailor or something like that. \n“But we have come pretty close to that in recent years,” he said. \nThe House itself claims that it is an “active and effective revising chamber” with a solid code of conduct. \nBaroness King of Bow used the documentary to defend the chamber, even arguing that it does more work than the Commons. \n“Look at what the Lords does and what the Commons does, and the comparative legislative chaos that is being sent from the Commons to the Lords, and I genuinely think, thank God the Lords are there to do the serious work, without just being inundated with the political point-scoring,” the Baroness said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:46:28.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
