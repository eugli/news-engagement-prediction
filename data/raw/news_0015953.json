How Obamacare could be dismantled by Republicans Read more \nBut in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday night, Trump said of replacing Obamacare: “In the process and maybe it will take till sometime into next year, but we are certainly going to be in the process. It’s very complicated.” \nHe continued to say it would “statutorily take a while” to get a new healthcare plan. \n“We’re going to be putting it in fairly soon, I think that, yes, I would like to say by the end of the year at least the rudiments, but we should have something within the year and the following year,” Trump said. \nTrump signed an executive order to begin the process of dismantling the Affordable Care Act (ACA), one of Barack Obama’s signature achievements, hours after taking office . But as the government works to tear down the law, polls have shown it is becoming more popular the closer it gets to being repealed. \nJoe Antos, a healthcare scholar for the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said it was difficult to know whether Trump’s comments were a response to those polls, but he viewed his statements as a positive sign the administration is realizing how long it could take to implement campaign promises. \n“I’m taking the more optimistic view that they’ve been talking about what it takes to change the existing law and it’s beginning to become clearer to him and everybody else that it’s just going to take some time,” Antos said. \nLast month, Trump said a plan to repeal and replace the health law would be implemented once his pick for health and human services secretary, Georgia representative Tom Price , was sworn in. \n“It will be essentially simultaneously,” Trump said on 11 January. “The same day or the same week ... could be the same hour.” \nBut as that hour approaches – Price could take the office as early as this week – Trump has now steered from his plan to immediately repeal and replace. \nIn recent weeks, Republican enthusiasm for repealing Obamacare has faced increasing backlash , reflected in the polls and on the streets. Democrats turn to American people to protect Obamacare from looming repeal Read more \nOver the weekend, Republican lawmakers faced jeering crowds at town halls in California and Florida, where constituents voiced their concerns about repealing Obamacare without a substantive alternative in place. \nCalifornia congressman Tom McClintock had to be escorted out of a town hall meeting for constituents just outside of the state’s capitol, Sacramento, after facing tough questions about the health law . \nMcClintock had raised his own concerns about his party’s plans in secret recordings obtained by news outlets, including the Guardian . \nRepealing key provisions of the ACA would leave 32 million people without health coverage over the next decade, according to an analysis released last month by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office . \nTop Senate Republicans such as Lamar Alexander, chairman of the health committee, have hesitated to support an aggressive repeal. \nOn Monday, Alexander said Congress would vote to repeal and replace the ACA this year, but echoed Trump’s claims that it would be a slow process. \n“While we will vote to repeal Obamacare this year, the repeal will take effect when concrete, practical alternatives are in place,” Alexander wrote in a blogpost. \nHe did not reference Trump’s comments to Fox News in the post. Last week he said : “It is more accurate to say ‘repair Obamacare’.” \nRepublicans have sought to repeal the health law, which has give 20 million Americans health insurance, since it first debated seven years ago. \n“Nobody has any doubt that Trump wants to repeal Obamacare – the key is what is Congress doing about it?” said Dan Holler, vice-president of communications and government relations for Heritage Action for America, a conservative advocacy group. \nHe said there has not been a strong push by Republicans to get a repeal bill on Trump’s desk, but the delay doesn’t mean repeal won’t happen. \n“The repeal is going to happen, but the longer it drags out, the more emboldened the left becomes and the more people in the media write about how Obamacare [replacement] is being delayed,” Holler said. “None of that is good in terms of actually getting good conservative health care policy that actually empowers patients through the congressional process and onto president Trump’s desk.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:05:56.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
