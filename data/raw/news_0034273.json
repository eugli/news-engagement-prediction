Tour will end long hiatus \nShows have been scarce in the past 15 years, but Garrett said the long absence would not affect their sound. \n\"I think we've never felt better, fresher, nastier, sweeter and more energetic,\" he said. \nThe band disbanded in 2002 as Garrett sought to further his political career, although they have gigged since then, including a 2009 Sound Relief concert in Melbourne to raise money for victims of the Black Saturday bushfires. External Link: Midnight Oil Goat Island \nHowever, Midnight Oil have not performed together since 2010. \nTheir most memorable gigs include an intimate 1985 show on Goat Island in Sydney Harbour, to celebrate radio station Triple J's 10th birthday, and the opening ceremony of the 2000 summer Olympics. \nThey made headlines that night for donning a now infamous Sorry Suits some seven years before then prime minister Kevin Rudd's apology to the Stolen Generations. \nThe statement was part of the band's long history of political activism, with Indigenous and environmental issues particularly prevalent in their music.
