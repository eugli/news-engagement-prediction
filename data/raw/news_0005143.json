People who live in isolation from others can fall prey to fear and thus to such a herd mentality, he said. \n\"People who are afraid want to dive into a feeling of 'us vs. them,'\" he said. \"The life of a herd has no destiny except to be driven off a cliff.\" \nCupich said those in a spiritual community like Regina, which is sponsored by the Adrian Dominican Sisters, should reach out to those who struggle with fears, adding, \"it is important to let people know they are not alone.\" \nThe cardinal, who is helping Chicago-area Catholic schools celebrate Catholic Schools Week, joined Regina Dominican as the high school kicked its own week of events with the Mass, held at Regina's O'Shaughnessy Theatre. The service drew alumni, family, and school supporters, as well as elementary students from St. Joan of Arc School in Skokie and The School of Saints Faith, Hope and Charity in Winnetka. \nChristine Finzer of Chicago and Buffy McNabola Rock of Lake Forest said they were alumni and former Wilmette residents. Both praised Regina's tradition of community. \n\"I love the school,\" Rock said. \"I think it's a place of family, and community and friendship.\" \nSister Dot Dempsey, an Adrian Dominican sister, said she attended the mass from the south side of Chicago. Dempsey, who said a niece attended Regina, said, \"it's a wonderful school.\" \nRegina President Elizabeth Pattara Schuster said the Mass and Cupich's visit have been in the works for roughly a month: \"We've been trying to have him come and bless the auditorium, and we are so glad that it worked out.\" \nThe auditorium underwent roughly $1.2 million in renovations, in part to make the space ADA compliant, Schuster said. Work, which was funded by Regina's \"The Gateway to Leadership\" capital campaign, began in June 2016 and was completed shortly before the end of October, Regina Communications Director Katie Pins said. Work included abating asbestos, creating a more accessible floor plan, adding more comfortable seats and replacing the space's original floor, she said. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:00:16.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
