It’s covered in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba and the Yukon, but not in British Columbia. \nBlake says the manufacturer has evidence showing that it does work for advanced patients.\n“BC PharmaCare has a policy that the manufacturer must submit any new evidence to a national process called Common Drug Review and the manufacturer is not willing to do that because they have secured agreements with the five other jurisdictions,” Blake said.\nThat fact doesn’t sit well with Paddi.\n“This DUODOPA therapy is essential for us, not to only affect our way of life, to keep us alive,” she said through tears. “I will die if I don’t get it and I don’t want to die yet.”\n\nThe Brentwood Bay woman has spent thousands of dollars on drugs and treatments, including chiropractor appointments, massage therapy, boxing and exercise classes.\nPaddi says the disease has also taken a toll on all aspects of her well-being, she even gets mistaken as her husband’s mother. \n“I’ve lost so much weight that I’m considered grossly malnourished,” she said. “We’ve tried all these damned other things that the government insist we try before they would approve the pump. We’ve tried them all, nothing works.”\n\nPaddi’s husband says they’ve even considered selling their house to pay for the DUODOPA treatment, but that would only cover five years. \n“Right now she really doesn’t have much of a life. It’s a full-time occupation for her and certainly for her caregiver as well,” Brian said. “Anything has to be better than this.”\nPaddi says she will continue her fight in the hopes that the government will one day listen. \n“How much longer can she go on living like this?” Brian said. “I’m not optimistic.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:26:13.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
