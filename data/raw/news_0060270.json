The experience will be different and unique in the world of films, comics and anime, with various activities and celebrity appearances from the local and international entertainment scene,” organizers said in a statement ahead of the event. \nAfter the event, however, the General Authority for Entertainment said that it will penalize the organizers for a “violation.” \n“The General Authority for Entertainment regrets the violation committed by the organizers of the Comic-Con event” at the event, the authority said, adding that its priority is “safeguarding values, morals and traditions,” as cited by AFP. — هشام فقيه (@HishamFageeh) February 18, 2017 \nThe authority did not specify the nature of the violation, but added that the event was a “general success in terms of content and organization.” \n“The violation has been monitored by the authority’s staff and was halted at the time. Sanctions will be applied against the executing company in parallel with what has been committed in violations,” the statement read, as cited by Arab News. \nHussein Al-Sheikh, the imam of the Prophet’s Mosque, criticized the event on Twitter, calling for a boycott. \n“We were astonished by the hideous act of the Entertainment Authority, by these events held in Jeddah that are not in line with good behavior or our great religion... It is a duty upon officials to consider God in these actions,” he said , as cited by Reuters.

Disgraceful,” one person wrote, referring to Saudi soldiers engaged in Yemen's civil war. سنووايت وباتمان لازم يكونوا في فلم بعد هالصورة، ولا ايش رأيكم؟😍 #سعودي_كوميك_كون #فريمرز pic.twitter.com/NwyTOy3DXv — FramedKeys (@framedkeys) February 17, 2017 \nOthers defended the event, creating the hashtag “the General Entertainment Authority makes us happy.” \nSaudi Arabia has strict rules regarding the segregation of single women and men.
