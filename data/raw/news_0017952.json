Bening is the first star officially announced for Ryan Murphy’s follow-up to “The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story,” though the director has also said that company player Sarah Paulson will have a role .\nAs a Louisiana native who lived there during Katrina, let me tell you: Bening’s casting is perfect. Blanco found herself embroiled in a power struggle with New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin and George W. Bush’s administration, resulting in an under-resourced region reeling from one of the country’s most devastating natural disasters in history. Blanco, a Democrat whose popularity dipped after Katrina, opted not to seek re-election in 2007. Watch her announcement video below ― you can imagine Bening word for word, channeling Blanco’s hostile poise and bob hairdo.\n“Katrina: American Crime Story” is slated to air in 2018 , according to FX Networks CEO John Landgraf. The series’ next installment, chronicling the Gianni Versace murders, will quickly follow.\nBening currently stars in the wonderful “ 20th Century Women ,” for which she should have earned an Oscar nomination .\nAlso on HuffPost The 21 Best Movies Of 2016 The 21 Best Movies Of 2016 1 of 21 \"Pete's Dragon\" As the summer blockbuster season drew to a close, \"Pete's Dragon\" was the warm blanket needed to shield ourselves from all the explosive mediocrity.

From the wilderness to the quaint town surrounding it, \"Pete's Dragon\" roves with a splendor that opposes the cynical forces working against our heroes.
