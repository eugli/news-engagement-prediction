Make sure you watch for the last camera angle: This 'Heavenly' strike from @MFMFC_Lagos 's Sikiru Olatunbosun has to be a contender for the 2017 Best @FIFAcom Puskas award. @LMCNPFL pic.twitter.com/HAY9iIWq1O \n— Tayo Salaam (@CTV_TayoS) February 25, 2017 \nA backheel flick puts the ball right at Olatunbosun’s feet and he lets it bounce once before flicking it over the defender and then rifling a long-range volley into the back of the net. The team instantly knows it’s a special goal as they clear the bench and run to Olatunbosun for a celebration. \nOlatunbosun’s strike helped lift MFM FC over Enugu Rangers, 2-1, and it lifted MFM to second place on the Nigeria Professional Football League table. \nEven though his goal came on Friday night, it may already be the best goal of the weekend. Simply divine. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:19:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
