It is rare for international acts to perform major concerts outside the capital cities or wineries. \n“I always love coming back to Australia. It holds a very special place in my heart. My band and I are really looking forward to playing there again in September and this tour will be even more memorable because it will be the first time I have ever played Wollongong,” John said. \n“If the audience in The Gong is anything like those at all of the other shows we have done in New South Wales over the years, everyone will surely be in for a wonderful night!” \nTickets go on sale on March 14.
