And while it's true that under Moffat's divisive leadership the recurring character of the Master -- the Doctor's archenemy -- regenerated into a woman known as Missy, the Doctor regenerating into a woman has never felt like something that was actually on the table. \nPeter Capaldi is leaving Doctor Who \nNow with Moffat's impending departure scheduled for the same time as Capaldi's, fans are hoping that incoming executive producer Chris Chibnall ( Broadchurch ) will finally break with tradition and cast the first female Doctor. Here at TVGuide.com, we thought we'd help Chibnall out and offer up a few suggestions -- both male and female -- for the heroic role. \nHayley Atwell \nAs Agent Peggy Carter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Atwell has already proven she can carry the weight of the world on her shoulders, something the Doctor has to do every single week. Add in Atwell's natural charisma and sense of humor and she'd make an amazing Doctor. The fact that she's already stated she wants to be the Doctor should also help her case. \nBen Whishaw \nThe immensely talented London Spy and James Bond actor has been a favorite pick among fans since Matt Smith first announced his departure from the series in 2013. In fact, he's so popular U.K. bookies currently have him at 6/1 odds to take over for Capaldi . If the producers want a younger Doctor but someone capable of being just as dark and angry as Twelve, Whishaw is the obvious choice. \nRichard Ayoade \nThis IT Crowd star could definitely capture the Doctor's eccentricities, and we have a feeling he has what it takes to tackle the show's heftier emotional drama too. That's why he's one of the more popular picks to play Thirteen -- if only his new gig hosting The Crystal Maze doesn't get in the way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:26:04.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
