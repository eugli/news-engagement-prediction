The problem with this is that Trump may live in a golden tower in Manhattan instead of in a gated compound in California, but he’s just as much a member of the Hollywood elite as anyone else is—at least according to George Clooney, who probably does have the authority to determine stuff like that. \nIn an interview with Canal+ ( via Vulture ), Clooney notes that Trump has 22 acting credits and collects $120,000 a year from his Screen Actors Guild pension fund, which would make anyone a member of the Hollywood elite. Of course, Trump being a massive hypocrite has never really been up for debate, but it’s still a good idea to remind yourself just how full of shit he really is. \nTrump isn’t the only guy in the White House who is full of shit, though, as Clooney points out that reanimated pile of rotting skin (and secret real president) Steve Bannon is also “a failed film writer and director,” making him practically a member of the Hollywood elite as well. Plus, as we’ve previously reported , he makes a ton of money off of Seinfeld reruns. Bannon is far too hate-filled and monstrous to bother trying to pass himself off as a common man, but his entertainment industry connections do further underline the extent to which Trump’s whole administration is full of shit. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:39:15.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
