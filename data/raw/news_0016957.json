Tasers not to be used on children or around volatile liquids \nThe court heard tasers were not allowed to be used against a young child, as well as near volatile liquids or near a car that might lose control, unless there were exceptional circumstances. \nJudge Fong Lim said there were no extraordinary circumstances that warranted the use of the taser on the boy, especially so close to a petrol bowser. \n\"At the time [officer] Watson raised his taser he was aware of these things,\" Judge Fong Lim said. \n\"I could be satisfied that the arrest was unlawful.\" \nJudge Fong Lim said there was \"no immediate danger to Watson\" and \"the taser should not have been deployed\". \nShe also ruled the offending of the boy \"was not of a particularly serious nature\" and the \"impropriety of raising the taser [by officer Watson] is great\". \nThe boy, whom the court heard had never been in trouble with police before, received a six-month good behaviour bond. \nJudge Fong Lim said she took the boy's suffering into account when making her decision. \n\"[Being tasered] must have been very painful ... unfortunately for you, you suffered at the hand of that,\" she said. \n\"There's a reason they are not to be used on children.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:36:54.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
