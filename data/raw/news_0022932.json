And thankfully the Professional Darts Corporation were on hand to record the matches. \nVan Wergen saw his three-month unbeaten sequence come to an end after being defeated by Ritchie Edhouse, just a day after drawing his opening Premier League match of the season against Gary Anderson.

But it seems Van Gerwen doesn't need the backing of a big crowd to spur him on, as he recreated the feat once again. \nYou can see Van Gerwen's ruthless finishing in the video below. \nAnd if that world-class performance against Murray was anything to go by, it's hard to imagine the Dutch genius not retaining the Premier League trophy. \n2016 was an incredible year for Van Gerwen - winning the Premier League, World Matchplay, World Grand Prix, UK Open, Grand Slam of Darts, European Championship, Players Championship Finals and The Masters- and there is nothing to suggest he can't retain those titles, also. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
