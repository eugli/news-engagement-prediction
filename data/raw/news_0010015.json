Key points: Coalition needs to find a way to get more people to listen to its ideas, MP says Government can provide energy security, make electricity more reliable and affordable than Labor, PM says Labor spokesman rejects Government's argument that business tax cuts would create more jobs \nMalcolm Turnbull will tell the nation he is listening to concerns that some parts of Australia are being left behind. \nIt is something the Government MP for the rural seat of Maranoa, David Littleproud, knows very well. \n\"It's rather a contrast [in Maranoa],\" he told AM. \n\"The reality is that I've got some parts of my electorate where we have effectively full employment — we can't get people into my electorate to do the jobs that we need them to do. \n\"In some smaller portions of the electorate there is an unemployment rate and we need to work with those.\" \nMr Littleproud said his electorate, which covers 43 per cent of Queensland, is experiencing both the upside and the downside of the transitioning economy. \n\"There are some parts where obviously industry hasn't caught up and we're starting to see that those parts are where we need to continue to work with to ensure that we bring them along on that journey with us,\" he said. \nHe said that his Government — with its plans for more trade deals, cheaper energy and company tax cuts — has a good story to tell, but that the Coalition needs to find a way to get more people to listen to its ideas. \n\"That's what jobs and growth looks like, and we need to get better in articulating that,\" Mr Littleproud said. \n\"We need to let people understand that the infrastructure that we're putting around them and the environment — through tax incentives and through trade agreements — is what will drive jobs and growth for people in Maranoa and right across rural and regional Australia.\" Coalition best-placed to provide job opportunities: PM \nMr Turnbull will say that while he is still optimistic about the country's future, he knows that in many areas around Australia jobs are scarce, times are not so good and prospects are less promising than they used to be. \nIt is a toning down of the unbridled optimism that the Prime Minister spoke about when he first became leader. \nHe says his Government can provide energy security and make electricity more reliable and affordable than Labor. \nAnd he will make a pitch that the Coalition Government is best placed to provide job opportunities for Australians. \nBut Labor's employment spokesman Brendan O'Connor said Labor's focus on building up skills and training is the best way to drive job growth around the country. \n\"Look, the Prime Minister might say that it's an exciting time to be alive, well, Labor says 'yes, there's some excitement to the technological changes that are occurring, but there's some anxiety too,,\" he said. \n\"We're going through the fastest change in the Labor market arguably in human history and in a globalised, knowledge-based economy, the critical point is to invest in lifelong learning.\" 'Trickle-down economics' will not lead to job growth: Labor \nBut Mr O'Connor rejects the Government's argument that business tax cuts would create more jobs and mean that workers would be better off. \n\"The problem with the Government's main answer to the problems that beset the nation is that they want to take $50 billion out of the public expenditure by giving it to multinational companies and banks,\" he said. \n\"We do not believe that trickle-down economics is going to lead to employment growth, and we, quite frankly, do not agree with the Government that they should be taking that approach. \nSo far the Government has not been able to secure the support of the Senate to pass the corporate tax cuts. \nPart of Mr Turnbull's objective with his speech today is to make the case that slashing business taxes is in everyone's interest. \nThe Coalition and Labor acknowledge that voters are turning away from the major parties. \nTrying to convince an increasingly disaffected public that they have got a solution is the major challenge for both parties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:12:56.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
