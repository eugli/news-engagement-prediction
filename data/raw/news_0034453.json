No, say Montagu Evans, consultants for the University of Durham in its campaign to prevent the listing of its student union building known as Dunelm House. “Whilst Monk is an acknowledged innovator in the ‘hard bop’ style,” they say, straying into jazz nobility from their usual specialist subject of construction and planning, “he is hardly a household name, even amongst Americans.” Their reason for addressing this question is that Monk, the second-most recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington, played at the building’s opening in 1966. Montagu Evans feels it must quash any idea that “it was a popular location for notable figures giving concerts”, which might help the case for listing it.\nIt and the university have so far been successful, though the Monk question might not have been pivotal. They have persuaded the secretary of state for culture, media and sport to grant a certificate of immunity, which stops the building from being listed for five years, during which time its owners can alter or demolish it as they please. They argue that a combination of faulty concrete, a leaky roof, poor insulation, inflexible construction, inadequate servicing and poor accessibility mean that it is unworthy of listing. They say that, apart from these issues, “it is not stylistically innovative… the architect is not an acknowledged leader of post-WWII British design… The interiors themselves are ordinary.”\nWith all due respect to Montagu Evans, and while acknowledging my own limited knowledge of jazz, I feel that anyone who dismisses Thelonius Monk so easily is also likely to miss the nuances that make Dunelm House, a building that clambers into the steep gorge of the river Wear, very much not “ordinary”. It is rather a machine for inhabiting the landscape, a manmade terrain of rooms and spaces – large, intimate, sociable, secluded, high, low, top-lit, side-lit – which, grouped around a plunging and generous staircase, help you see the banks of green on the other side and feel the slopes of the ground. It is a way of being in the gorge while also – as a human being rather than a bird – using the facilities offered to human students, such as a bar, ballroom, games room, events rooms, meeting rooms and offices.\nThe building cannot be considered alone, but together with Sir Ove Arup’s Kingsgate Bridge, completed shortly before Dunelm House, and the city’s stupendous cathedral on the other side. The bridge, a beam poised on two Vs, is rightly Grade I listed. The ensemble explores masonry’s full range of mass and levitation, with the stone cathedral tower piling up towards the sky and the concrete bridge resting in the air. The craggy forms of Dunelm House, while cantilevering against gravity, also allow it to pull them close to the slope.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Students at Durham apparently refer to Dunelm House as ‘that ugly concrete building’. Photograph: Mark Tallentire/Durham University \nThe building’s design, by the Architects Co-Partnership in collaboration with Arup’s engineering company, keeps returning you to considered views of the bridge and the cathedral while continuing to play in lesser keys with the themes of heft and lightness. The ceiling of the cafeteria is satisfyingly sculpted; its walls cut away at the corners to allow windows to wrap round. Irregularly placed mullions set up vibrating rhythms. A consistency of material and detail, inside and out, unifies the complexity of the spaces and enhances the sense that, as much as architecture, this is abstracted geology.\nThe university argues that its technical problems outweigh its other qualities, with the help of both Montagu Evans and a critical recent report by the same Arup that helped design it. It says that it doesn’t fit in with its expansion plans, with the needs of a modern university to attract students with shining new facilities. It points out that the building was designed for student numbers of 3,000, that the figure is now 17,500 and is expected to reach 21,000 by 2027.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: via Mark Tallentire/Durham University \nHistoric England and the Twentieth Century Society disagree. The society has appealed against the granting of the certificate, arguing that many of the technical claims are not proven and cite the culture department’s own view that “the state of repair of a building is not a relevant consideration when deciding whether a building meets the test of special interest”. You would expect, it says, that a building of this age would require some extensive repairs.\nCatherine Croft, director of the Twentieth Century Society, argues that the point of listing is not to preserve a building at all costs, but “to tip the scales in favour of a more imaginative approach”. She is not opposed to all changes to a building like Dunelm House – a lift tower, for example, to solve its access problems. “You can adapt them but you have to try harder.” You could add that, as usual in these cases, those wishing to demolish combine protestations against an existing building’s environmental wastefulness with silence on the question of embodied energy – that is, the large amount of resources and materials that is lost when a building is destroyed and rebuilt.\nEngineering the World review – Ove Arup, the man who built modernity Read more \nThere’s not much doubt that, if Dunelm House were a bit older – medieval, Victorian or even 1930s – it would be protected. Then the university, as with the 65 listed buildings now in its care, would have no choice but to deal with the awkward staircases and draughty windows that tend to come with historic structures of any age. Plenty of people are not yet ready to love brutalism – the activities officer of the students’ union tells me they refer to Dunelm House as “the ugly concrete building” – but it is rapidly undergoing the inevitable transformation of taste that saw Victorian buildings change in public perception from monstrosities to treasures. The building’s charms would also be more obvious if it wasn’t in its current shabby and neglected state.\nNext week the Royal Academy publishes Lost Futures , a book by its former architecture programme curator Owen Hopkins, on the “disappearing architecture of postwar Britain”. It will show buildings that were awkward, cussed and sometimes unsaveable, but also majestic, romantic and unrepeatable, like the Trinity Square car park in Gateshead , Pimlico school in London and Birmingham central library. It’s hard not to feel, contemplating these works, that a layer of British history is being filleted away and that the evidence is being removed of a heroic period in British architecture.\nThe University of Durham says that it is keeping an open mind about Dunelm House and, whatever the outcome of the Twentieth Century Society’s appeal, retention will still be a possibility. “Whatever we do there will be discussions,” it says. I hope so. It is in danger of wrecking what, according to an English Heritage report on Durham in 1995, is “the greatest contribution modern architecture has made to the enjoyment of an English medieval city”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:02:37.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
