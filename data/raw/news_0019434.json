When you see the results come in and remember you were supposed to go the bookies. Image: PA \nUnfortunately, Casillas junior never made it to the bookies (rumours, that we're starting right now, suggest that the distant tingle of an ice cream van's bell or an impromptu game of British Bulldog distracted him) and, as you can probably guess, all 14 of his dad's selections came in. \nThe forgotten slip would have brought £1m to the Casillas household. So it's probably a good job Iker went onto become one of the greatest and most decorated goalkeepers of his generation. #ICYMI : Iker Casillas has still got it :wink:An incredible last-minute save to ensure victory for #FCPorto ... pic.twitter.com/8Muo03P2cv - BetVictor (@BetVictor) February 6, 2017 \nSo, just remember, unless your child has incredible hand eye co-ordination, is fantastic at catching and has an affinity for rushing to the feet of anyone moving towards them, maybe it's for the best to just put your own bets on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:12:35.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
