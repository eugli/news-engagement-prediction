Charlotte Dawson, in personal photos supplied by her best friend, Jo Thornely. (Pic: Supplied) \nToday marks the third anniversary of the death of my friend Charlotte Dawson. \nI haven’t written about her before now — not since her death, anyway. I wrote about her when she was alive, because she let me help her stick some of her life stories in a book. \nShe insisted that we include the one where she blamed a fart she did in Africa on the local wildlife, which is the kind of person she was: a funny, clever, spontaneous, sophisticated fart-blamer. \nI haven’t written about her before now for a number of reasons — it was painful, I couldn’t have done her justice, I didn’t want to sound like a name-dropper and I didn’t know what to say. \nBut now, with the world, politics, television and social media the way it is, I’ve been thinking a lot about how much of the stuff she really loved since she’s been missing — her darling Bunnies winning the 2014 grand final; the chance to exasperatedly commentate the rise of Trump; the chance to rage against injustices and fight for the causes she believed in. Charlotte Dawson, hamming it up at a cheese factory with Jo Thornely. (Pic: Supplied) \nCharlotte wasn’t to know that she was 100 per cent designed to be alive, sassy and indignant in 2017 but over the last year, I can’t think of anyone better equipped to be enthusiastically, vocally indignant about what the world is like right now.
