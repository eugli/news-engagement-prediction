In this round of talks he has rolled over and given away £68 million of taxpayer’s money.” Everything you need to know about next week's three-day Tube strike \nHowever, City Hall rejected the figure – saying it was wrongly based on the assumption that all new staff would be full time, when in fact just 200 were expected to be. \nIt also assumed they would all be in the highest salary band when that had yet to be decided. \nA source close to the Mayor said: “This is total nonsense from the Tories . Sadiq will keep working around the clock to reduce the number of strikes because he is firmly on the side of commuters.” \nThe unions say the job cuts raise major safety issues in running the network used by more than four million people a day – claims London Underground denies. \nLU had previously said it would hire 200 new staff this year but that by filling existing vacancies and accounting for natural turnover the figure would increase to 600 – an offer rejected by the unions. \nMore than 3,000 RMT staff are planning to walk out from 6pm this Sunday until 10am on the Monday; then again from 10am on Tuesday 7 February until 1am on Wednesday 8. \nThe union has warned of further strikes in March if an agreement is not reached when talks with London Underground resume.
