Being famous and getting attention. Don't forget that you are a wife but on top of all a mummy. BIG BROTHER IS NOT SUITED TO YOU,' another offered his opinion. If the make-up entrepreneur makes the decision to star in the next instalment of CBB - which saw Coleen Nolan being crowned champion in the latest series - she would make for a feisty addition to the line-up. 'You will be more famous than Kim Kardashian!' One user teased her with her future status as a result of the upcoming TV opportunity 'It'll be a mistake!' A few others expressed their concerns about the 'tricky decision' Faryal is no stranger to squabbles and her drama with her husband's family has been played out extensively over the past few months. She recently gave her sports-star hubby an ultimatum to choose between her or his family after months of infighting and rows. Faryal banned the boxer from attending his younger brother Haroon's wedding because she still can't forgive him for comparing her to Michael Jackson. And she also harbours fears that more sex tapes of her husband could emerge, putting further pressure on their relationship. The recent sex tape, which was reportedly been leaked to a major US porn site, featured the former world champion boxer carrying out a sex act while speaking to a female model on Skype. Explosive: If the make-up entrepreneur makes the decision to star in the next instalment of CBB, she would make for a feisty addition to the line-up Feud: Faryal is no stranger to squabbles and her drama with her husband's family has been played out extensively over the past few months The Khans appeared on This Morning last month to claim that the webcam footage of Khan was made before they met. The couple, who live in Bolton, Greater Manchester and married in the US 2013, also suggested it was leaked out of spite by someone once 'close' to them. But now beauty blogger Faryal, who became engaged to the star five years ago on Sunday, fears another tape could soon be unveiled. 'She's paranoid about another sex tape being leaked. She's controlling and bossy and now wants to be with her husband all the time,' said a source close to the couple. Drama: She recently gave her sports-star hubby an ultimatum to choose between her or his family after months of infighting and also harbours fears that more sex tapes of her husband could emerge 'She wants to be with Amir at every moment and in everything he does to keep tabs on him and ensure he remains on track,' a source close to the family revealed. The source said: 'It caused a huge problem when it was leaked last week and although Faryal was aware of it they still had a big row and they've been arguing endlessly about the family rift and Haroon. Meanwhile, Haroon said he was 'bitterly disappointed' at the boxer not attending the wedding and said he was upset that his famous brother 'didn't even send a message of congratulations.' 'Amir told Faryal that would cause an outcry if they didn't go.' At war: The bitter feud has seen her looks being likened to Michael Jackson and her father-in-law vowing never to speak to her again 'She said if he went it would be alone which would show he had disowned her in favour of pleasing Haroon. She can't forget about those remarks, they really hurt her. And to add a further blow, Amir's father revealed he would never talk to Faryal ever again after he was 'humiliated' following his sacking as the boxer's manager. Mr Khan has always managed his son's professional career, seeing him through the ups and down of the 30-year-old champion boxer's life. 'He feels humiliated in his community, in my own homes, and globally,' a family friend told MailOnline. 'Credit for that goes to Faryal who got Amir to do it.'
