He got destroyed in return. IndiaToday.in | Written by Devarsi Ghosh A + A - \nSwara Bhaskar of Nil Battey Sannata and Raanjhanaa fame will soon be seen in yet another solo lead role in the film Anaarkali Of Aarah. After the poster of the same hit the internet yesterday, Swara kept getting congratulated for her fabulous, glamourous look in the poster. \nAmong those appreciating Swara Bhaskar was filmmaker Karan Johar. Karan tweeted the poster saying, \"Well done, @ReallySwara for constantly breaking ground!\" Well done @ReallySwara for constantly breaking ground!! 24th march is the date guys ! For this new world and engaging film!!! pic.twitter.com/3zmuUvOIrO â€” Karan Johar (@karanjohar) February 20, 2017 \nSuddenly, out of nowhere, emerged self-styled film critic Kamaal Rashid Khan AKA KRK who chose to deliver his unsolicited verdict, once again, on Karan Johar's tweet and Anaarkali Of Aarah. Sir @karanjohar it will not be a flop or washout, but it will be super duper disaster of the year coz KRK says so. https://t.co/Ugu3GPfFxT â€” KRK (@kamaalrkhan) February 20, 2017 \nNot betraying hubris at all, Kamaal Rashid Khan wrote, \" it will not be a flop or washout, but it will be super duper disaster of the year coz KRK says so.\" \nTo this, Swara Bhaskar gave a strong and stern reply. She wrote, \" Kuch logon ki gaali, compliment hoti hai ! :) Thanks @kamaalrkhan the unasked filth u spew is a character certificate for us!\" Kuch logon ki gaali, compliment hoti hai! :) Thanks @kamaalrkhan the unasked filth u spew is a character certificate for us! ðŸ™�ðŸ�¿ Appreciated. https://t.co/4rDCWQShio â€” Swara Bhaskar (@ReallySwara) February 20, 2017 \nKamaal Rashid Khan is known for his absurd, often sexist and racist tweets. For his maniacal ways, he has frequently gone into loggerheads with several female actors, for example, Sonakshi Sinha , Parineeti Chopra and Lisa Haydon. KRK famously got into controversy last year when he somehow became the main character in the box-office war between Ajay Devgn , and his film Shivaay, and Karan Johar and his film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.
