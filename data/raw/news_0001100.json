By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 4, 2017 5:35 PM Sreesanth has hit back at Aakash Chopra over his comeback comment. (Source: Reuters) \nIndia’s 33-year-old ‘controversial’ fast-bowler S Sreesanth hit back at former Indian cricketer and now commentator Aakash Chopra for his remarks over pacer’s potential comeback to international cricket. When a fan asked Aakash Chopra whether Sreesanth will make a comeback to the Indian side, the former Indian opener gave a rude reply by saying ‘NO’. \nObviously, it didn’t go well with the Kerala speedster who was quick to reply. He assured both Aakash Chopra and the fan that he will make a comeback because he believes that he could. His tweet read as, “I will make a comeback brother..can’t believe u don’t believe that I will play again..anyways God bless us.” \nYou may also want to watch: \n\nThis was an embarrassing moment for Aakash Chopra who has earned a name for himself as one of the most dignified presenter and analyst on the Indian TV. He, however, clarified that it was his personal opinion and he still stands by it. “Not two-faced. That’s my opinion and I stand by it. Never told anyone anything else. I would have the same opinion for my own brother,” said Chopra. \nIn reply to Sreesanth’s tweet Chopra wished will luck for the future but the drama didn’t end here as Sreesanth bashed Chopra for his ‘desh-drohi’ comments and criticised him for naming any other person involved in the incident. “I hope ur comments about desh drohi…..etc,also includes the other 13 people who was charged Nd the unopened envelope,” said Sreesanth. \n\n— Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash) January 31, 2017 \n@cricketaakash @im_jeswin I will make a comeback brother..can’t believe u don’t believe that I will play again..anyways God bless us \n— Sreesanth (@sreesanth36) February 1, 2017 \nNot two-faced.

One rule for everyone. http://t.co/kooirNK4UE \n— Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash) February 3, 2017 \nSreesanth also taunted Chopra by saying that he is looking forward to hear Chopra’s commentary when he will represent India again. As optimistic as Sreesanth may be, India has formed a string bowling line-up with the likes of Mohammad Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav and Jasprit Bumrah which willl make his return very tough.
