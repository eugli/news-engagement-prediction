One wrong press of a button or a moment of memory lapse, and everything is ruined. But some people have seen the funny side in failure, and shared photographs of their biggest cooking errors with Bored Panda . The pictures are a lesson to everyone in the importance of using a tray and keeping an eye on your rolls at all times. All the better to see you with! One unlucky baker lost their glasses... only to find them when they pulled their bread out of the oven One unlucky person gave the gift of sight to a loaf of what appears to be bread, with the unlucky chef clearly not realising until the food was cooked. The picture shows a pair of metal-rim glasses clearly baked into the loaf, with the inside of the food visible through the lenses. Following their time in the oven, the spectacles were likely out of commission, as the tops of the lenses appeared to have melted off of the metal frame. Petrifying: This cake was so off-putting, a child cried just from looking at it Birthday cakes were another source of frustration for the battling baker. One parent reduced children to tears with their petrifying recreation of what appears to be a skull cake. The use of candy teeth was arguably the scariest part, with the chocolate sticks for hair doing nothing to help the situation. Another ambitious parent was perhaps too confident in their icing abilities, and the monkey they had tried to achieve ended up looking like it had met some bad people in an alleyway. Where have you been? Though baked with the best intentions, this parents' monkey cake gave off a much different impression of the jungle animal At least the crust didn't burn! One hungry cook would have been crushed to see their pizza had melted through the oven rack because they forgot to use a tray While frozen pizza is generally considered an easy dish to master, some have more trouble than others. Though it emerges from the freezer hard as a rock, frozen pizza soon melts in an oven - and without a tray it will melt straight through the rack. A hungry home-cook was crushed to return to their oven only to find what should have been a pizza was in fact flavoured strips of dough, lying on the oven floor. They may have found a glimmer of hope in the fact that the crust made it through the ordeal, and was fully intact. A lot to explain: One unfortunate chef had a pressure cooker disaster which saw the base break through the stovetop and the lid wedge itself into the roof And while many of the above baking fails are common mistakes which are easy to understand, one stands out as completely inexplicable. A photograph shows the havoc wreaked by a pressure cooker on the fritz. The base of the machine had somehow broken through the stovetop and sat partially in the oven below, while the lid had pushed through the rangehood to wedge itself in the roof. More to love: Another unlucky baker fashioned themselves a gingerbread man, but it expanded rapidly in the oven and became more of a gingerbread circle A gingerbread man came out of the oven significantly larger than he was when he went in, surprising his baker. With its growth, the biscuit man also lost much of its shape, which made it more of a circle than a man. The wannabe chef was able to laugh it off, sharing the picture to Instagram and acknowledging his first attempt 'didn't go exactly to plan'. Still delicious! One unsuspecting woman followed a Pinterest recipe for 90-second waffle cookies, but was outraged to discover she had been fooled and was left with cookie crumble When one unlucky baker followed a recipe for 90-second waffle cookies, she was hoping for one, large, intact biscuit. Unfortunately her waffle-maker was not interested in making things easy. The woman discovered she had created large clumps of crumbling cakey dough instead, leaving her disappointed. Not for human consumption: One woman was upset to see the soft, airy potato bread she thought she'd made more closely resembled a brick Hoping to create a soft, airy loaf with a crunchy crust, Instagram user elanorgee tried her hand at potato bread. But despite her best efforts, she was disappointed when her loaf was almost entirely the opposite. 'Tried to make potato bread. Instead, I recreated an ancient Appalachian building material,' she captioned the image.
