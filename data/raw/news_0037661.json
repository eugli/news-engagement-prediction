The latest upgrades, and downgrades, for the cream of the English top-flight crop have been announced for the popular video game. Martial, though, remains short of a magical mark in one particular area. He prides himself on his speed, with his ability to eat up the ground helping to make him a frightening prospect for opposition defenders. The France international has, however, queried what he has to do in order to move off a score of 93. — Anthony Martial (@AnthonyMartial) February 18, 2017 If the 21-year-old can maintain the standards he has set over recent weeks, then maybe his ratings will be reassessed. Martial took his goal tally for the season to seven in all competitionswith a particularly impressive display put in during United’s last Premier League outing against Watford. The Hornets were unable to contain him that day and many more opponents can expect to be tested by his pace before the season is out, even if he is not considered by FIFA compilers to be the ultimate speedster.
