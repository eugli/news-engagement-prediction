According to Evan Blass, the Moto G5 Plus will be available on the US network but there is no confirmation of its younger brother, the Moto G5. \nWhile press renders and leaked images have appeared online earlier, this is the first clear image of the device and showcases the new design direction Motorola is taking with Moto G4's successor. Also Read: HTC One X10 images leaked, set to launch at MWC 2017 \nThe image correlates with recently leaked renders of the international version of the Moto G5 Plus and shows the device's circular camera panel, metal body, slightly rounded edges, a home button up front and the new silver colour variant. \nOn the specifications front, the Moto G5 Plus is expected to come with a 5.2-inch fullHD display, a 3,000mAh battery with TurboPower quick charging support, a 12MP 'rapid focus' rear camera, NFC, Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box as well as a fingerprint scanner. Additionally, the smartphone is expected to be powered by Qualcomm's mid-range Snapdragon 625 processor which is the same SoC seen on the Moto Z Play. Price and availability \nBoth the Moto G5 Plus and its younger brother, the Moto G5 are expected to be announced on February 26 at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The Verizon version is expected to be unveiled in the US on April 3. \nThe Moto G5 Plus is set to be priced at $250 (Approximately Rs 16,800) and the Moto G5 at $200 (Approximately Rs 13,400) although we expect the Indian prices to be a bit lower keeping in mind that the Moto G4 Plus was launched at Rs 13,499 and the Moto G4 at Rs 12,499 back in 2016.
