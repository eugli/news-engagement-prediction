I got the generals in who are fantastic … but I told Boeing that isn't good enough, the price is still too high,\" Trump said.\n\"I refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion plane,\" he also said.\nSubscribe today to get intelligence and analysis on defense and national security issues in your Inbox each weekday morning from veteran journalists Jamie McIntyre and Jacqueline Klimas.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

But Boeing would not get into specifics on where the savings were coming from.\n\"We'll continue to work with the administration to provide the best capability — affordably — to our warfighters,\" a company spokeswoman said.\nTodd Harrison, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said it's \"most likely\" that Trump worked with Boeing to scale back the requirements for the planes and simply the testing it must undergo.\n\"There are a lot of ways you could do it cheaper. The way that you buy it from Boeing, the terms that you buy it on can affect the cost, but most importantly, the requirements you put on the aircraft that require additional development and testing and certification, that can add a lot to the cost.\"\nThat tracks roughly with what Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in January after meeting with Trump.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Pelosi slams Trump's 'cruel' immigration orders \"Tearing apart families and dragging parents out of their homes does not make America great,\" Pelosi said.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 02/21/17 5:08 PM \"[W]e made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices,\" he said. \"All of that is gonna provide a better airplane at a lower cost.\"\nBut Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group, was less optimistic that Trump's claims meant true savings. He said the budget for the program originally was about $3 billion, but Trump criticized it as a $4 billion program previously on Twitter.\n\"That was a fabrication. Then when he was told, it's a $2.7-2.9 billion program, he said I just saved a billion dollars,\" Aboulafia said. \"I'm embarrassed there are people who believe this.\"\nHarrison did note that the $4 billion number comes from a \"funding wedge\" that the Air Force put in its budget documents, essentially making it an internal estimate to reserve space in future budgets for the program. It is not a formal cost estimate because the program is still in its early stages.\nThe two 747-8 planes aren't expected to enter service until 2024.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Schumer calls Trump's immigration rules a 'mass deportation plan' Senate minority leader says order would \"round up and quickly deport anyone who is undocumented.\"\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 02/21/17 4:41 PM At the same rally, Trump said he would be looking at whether the country actually needs to buy two Air Force One planes. \"Why they need two planes, we'll have to talk about that,\" he said.\nWhile the two experts disagreed about the source of the savings, they both said two planes should be the minimum.\n\"The question of whether two are needed is based on a completely grotesque misunderstanding of how military requirements work,\" Aboulafia said. \"The president has to fly when he has to fly, especially in the event of a national emergency. If this thing is offline for maintenance or refurbishment 25 percent of the time, not flying in those circumstances is not an option.\"\nOnly having one plane gives the country no backup in case the president needs to fly, such as on 9/11 when President George W. Bush remained in the air aboard Air Force One for hours until officials had determined what was going on and where the president would be safe.\nIn fact, Harrison said the Air Force would prefer to have three planes.\n\"There are times when one of the planes needs to go in for scheduled maintenance. During that time you have no backup, so if something breaks on one remaining plane, you have a security issue,\" he said.\nTop Story Trump administration to rewrite Obama's transgender bathroom rule Justice Department plans to issue guidance ensuring  \nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 02/21/17 3:14  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:27:22.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
