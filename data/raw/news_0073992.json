Defy convention, forget the Med and opt for the wild Bohuslän coast of Sweden, says Peter Hughes Credit: HENRIK TRYGG Peter Hughes , Travel writer  05pm \nT here is a law in the physics of travel which states that when the British are partially or completely immersed in leisure, they head south. As predictably as Newton’s apple, a Briton in search of relaxation gravitates to lower latitudes and higher temperatures. \nIt may not be as immutable as Archimedes’ Principle but it applies nine times out of 10. Which is a shame: it’s so limiting. Just for a change, counter the intuition, buck the trend and go north. Head for those lands that are thinly populated and thickly forested, with long summer days but less need for sun block – and which, crucially, are not in conflict. The 15 best alternatives to another predictable Mediterranean holiday \nSome, like Sweden, are even outside the Eurozone. Since last summer the pound has bought just over five per cent fewer Swedish kroner compared with some 20 per cent fewer euros. So a dish of cod au gratin, which cost £15.22 in Sweden last May, costs only about another 80p today. Who knows? Cool could turn out to be the new cool. Which is how I found myself on a flight to Gothenburg to spend six days touring the west coast by car. Trendy Gothenburg Credit: ALAMY \nGothenburg is Scandi-blanc. Free from the oppression of high-rises, it’s like a city with the roof off. I had one evening there before picking up my hire car and made straight for Haga, the “old town”. Haga Nygata is a long street of elderly buildings which, if they are not timber, are made of stone to look like timber. It is not overtly touristy or, if it is, they are Swedish tourists looking for hats and light fittings as much as delicatessens and cafés. It was there, at Sjöbaren, a sort of gastropub with wood-planked walls, that I had the cod. In retrospect, I wish I had chosen “Fillet of Witch”. Sounds spellbinding. The Gothenburg archipelago Credit: ALAMY \nSweden’s wild west – the Bohuslän coast – is a free, breezy shore of sea and rock running from Gothenburg to the Norwegian border. It’s only about 100 miles long but is a complex puzzle of straits and islands, inlets and crusty shorelines of low, coarse cliffs. \nOn the water, flattened skerries are strewn like maritime cobbles. Some are as smooth as buttocks, others scraped and abraded by glaciers as they dragged themselves across the landscape 10,000 years ago. If Norway’s coast was slashed by nature, Sweden’s was crushed. Sweden’s wild west – the Bohuslän coast – is a free, breezy shore of sea and rock running from Gothenburg to the Norwegian border Credit: Slow Images/Slow Images \nThe coast is epitomised by the Weather Isles. The Väderöarna Islands, as the guidebooks have them, are an archipelago of 365 lumps of curvaceous rock. There are few trees but there is colour: daubs of orange algae, clumps of purple sea thrift in spring and settlements of blood-red houses, timbered and tiled. Even the rock is pinkish. \nThey get their name from having “the hardest weather in Sweden”, Mikael Hansson said as we sped 35 minutes by powerful catamaran out to his guesthouse on Storö. It’s an old pilot’s house; most buildings are. \nStorö was a pilot station before the demise of coastal shipping in the Sixties. But their lookout hut is still there, perched on giant concrete legs, a tiny shed which was manned 24 hours a day. The pilots were a fractious bunch. Even the two families that shared the guesthouse feuded. Today it’s more civilised, with a decent restaurant and rooms so popular they are booked for New Year until 2024. \nAround Lyckorna, on the mainland, the coast is more genteel, tamed over 150 years by grand waterfront houses with towers and verandas, their own docks and sometimes boathouses. \nI stayed in one, Villa Sjötorp. Built of wood in 1901 by a paper-mill owner as a neo-gothic summer house, it is now a 14-bedroom hotel. White, with a green roof and three pointy gables decorated with fretwork, it has a fairy-tale quality. The lawn, shaded by a colossal tree, plunges to a private beach. Rooms may be homely but the food is not. At dinner, the dining room was packed with gourmet Swedes who had driven miles for the five-course tasting menu. \nTwo minutes up the road at Ljungskile, Janne Bank runs “seafood safaris” to harvest mussels. I joined him on Märta, a 36ft former fishing boat painted scarlet. The mussels grow on 10 submerged rigs, each an eighth of a mile long, marked by drum-shaped floats. Eider ducks are reckoned to snaffle a good 55lb of mussels a month. There are plenty left: each rig carries 200 tons. Märta tilted 10 degrees as her crane strained to haul bunches of mussels on board. Ashore, Janne steamed them with diced vegetables in sparkling wine in a pan big enough to signal satellites. Lunches don’t come much fresher. On to Fjällbacka, a village jammed on to a shelf of land beneath a 240ft granite cliff. It’s massive, but look closely and bits of it are discreetly shored up with concrete buttresses. The waterfront is spiny with timber jetties, behind which rises a collage of candy-coloured houses, garnet, vanilla and ochre. The smallest, old boathouses, are not much bigger than sheds. It’s not fashionable enough to be smart but too prosperous to be scruffy. There are few trees but there is colour: daubs of orange algae, clumps of purple sea thrift in spring and settlements of blood-red houses, timbered and tiled Credit: ALAMY \nFjällbacka has an extra patina of chic because, for a quarter of a century it was the summer home of Ingrid Bergman, goddess of 20th-century cinema. She was born in Stockholm but Fjällbacka, or rather Dannholmen Island, about a mile offshore, became the part of Sweden she called home. Here she could flee the relentless attention attracted by a three-time Oscar winner. For 24 years she spent her summers on Dannholmen. Her third husband, the impresario Lars Schmidt, bought it for her in 1957. In Fjällbacka’s village square, named after her, there’s a bust and photographs of her family holidays. In several there appears a young man called Lasse Lundberg. Now 80, he used to own the village restaurant and sailing school. I met him through a moment of traveller’s serendipity. \nI had retreated to the village pizza restaurant for a brief respite from fish. My waitress, Berith Haj Khalifa, wife of the Tunisian chef, remembered serving the star in the Fjällbacka bakery. “But the person you need to talk to is Lasse Lundberg,” she said. \nLasse taught Ingrid to sail. “That was how we met,” he recalled. “She phoned one day in 1968 and said, 'I want to learn to sail because Lars has bought a boat’.” It was the start of a long friendship. Lasse often stayed on the island. “She didn’t want to talk about her films,” he said. “She was so down to earth.” One of his most potent memories is of helping her wash up. Fjällbacka Credit: ANDREA PUCCI \nDannholmen became a bolt-hole for the A-list of the day. Lasse was their boatman. Diana Ross was a guest; Marcello Mastroianni and Roman Polanski were frequent visitors, as was Alfred Hitchcock. “Because of his size it was difficult to get out of the boat.” \nIn the summer of 1982, Lasse and Ingrid had dinner. At her insistence they ate crevettes. “She said, 'I want to do something for Fjällbacka.’ I said, 'You have done so much already’.” Two weeks later she died in London on her 67th birthday. Her ashes were scattered in the sea off Dannholmen. \nThere’s another display of domestic images about 10 miles north of Fjällbacka. They are 3,500 years old. The Tanum rock carvings comprise the biggest and most important collection of Bronze Age art in Scandinavia and are on Unesco’s World Heritage list. There are at least 1,500 sites and 40,000 engravings, little Lowry-like stick figures scratched into beds of granite, some controversially picked out in red paint to make them more photogenic. I saw the ones at Vitlycke, where there is a museum. All Bronze Age life is here, shared in prehistoric Instagrams: ships, chariots, warfare and sex. A prequel to Scandi-noir. \nMy final stop was at Bjertorp Slott, a domestic castle built at Kvänum in 1914 for a wealthy diplomat. It became a hotel in the Eighties but kept its striking Art Nouveau detailing in marble, mahogany and an elaborate plaster ceiling. Läckö Castle Credit: ALAMY \nThis is something it has in common with Läckö Castle, but Läckö dates from 1298 and was a proper fortification, although it was given a fancy Baroque makeover in the early 17th century. Most of the artistry went upwards: in one room a dozen chubby cherubs actually dangle from the ceiling. The building is massive. Standing four square on the shore of Lake Värnen, painted white, turreted and domed, it’s half fantasy, half forbidding. It could be Disney’s take on Colditz. \nMy guide began one of the regular tours for English speakers with a kindly admonition: “Most things here are 300 to 400 years old, so try not to touch them too much. I know it can be hard.” That’s Sweden for you – kind, relaxed, friendly, different, and sometimes irresistible, all reasons to head north.
