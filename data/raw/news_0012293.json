Take his latest $7.05 million buy in Double Bay. \nSeaDragon is the Mediterranean-style villa designed in 1936 by renowned architect Professor Leslie Wilkinson and more recently updated by architect Luigi Rosselli. \nCharming just doesn’t cover it thanks to its curved balcony, arched entry gate, and all set behind a sandstone wall. \nMike Cannon-Brookes has spent more than $7 million on this charming investment property in Double Bay. Photo: Supplied \nWhat better investment property for the 37-year-old co-founder of Atlassian software company, who is revealed as the buyer after it settled in a company name, of which he is the sole owner. \nCannon-Brookes and his Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar again topped the BRW Young Rich List in 2016, with a combined wealth of $4.6 billion, making it the fifth time they’ve taken the top spot since they made their debut on the list in 2007. \nThe property was formerly owned by Francis Douglas, QC, before Cannon-Brookes fought off good competition to buy it under the hammer through Michael Pallier, of Sotheby’s International, and Sally Hampshire, of Laing+Simmons Double Bay. \nMike Cannon-Brookes has paid more than $7 million for this house on Wiston Garden, Double Bay. \nCannon-Brookes, who bought his Centennial Park trophy home in 2015 for $12 million, has also added a 390-hectare hobby farm in the Southern Highlands to his property portfolio. \nRecords show the Joadja property was purchased in the same company name just before Christmas for $3.3 million from lawyer Ivan Haege and his wife Antonia. \nThe weekender homestead is surrounded by private native bushland with horse riding trails and 72 hectares of pastured grazing land. The Haege family listed it in 2015 before it sold through Michael Maloney, of Richardson & Wrench Bowral.
