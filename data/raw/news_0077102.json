It is time to face the evidence and put a full stop to harassment and assault on campus.” \nOne in five women have experienced sexual assault since the age of 15, and one in 25 men, according the the Australian Bureau of Statistics, with the greatest risk being at typical university age. \nOne 2015 study by the National Union of Students found 27% of respondents had experienced sexual assault while enrolled at uni. \nHowever, little further research has been conducted into the prevalence or nature of sexual assault among university campuses. The organisation said there was “some evidence” that previous research attempts were “blocked or undermined amid reputational concerns from the institutions”. \nRates of assault were likely much higher than revealed, EROC suggested, with other studies finding as few as one in 72 victims reported being assaulted to universities. \nAmong the numerous incidents and allegations, the report described an ACT residential college practice called “rockspidering”. \n“During orientation week, male students at a residential college would knock on female student’s bedroom door: if the female opened the door, this was taken as ‘consent’ to have sex,” the report said. \nIt also noted previously reported incidents including a 2009 Facebook group created by a student at Sydney University’s St Paul’s College, called “Define statutory: pro-rape, anti-consent”; student revue skits about the drug Rohypnol to “help a student get laid”; and the creation of stubby holders emblazoned with “It’s not rape if it’s my birthday” at Sydney University’s Wesley College. \nPolice data revealed 153 official reports of rape and sexual assault in the five years to 2016 allegedly occurred on university property. \nIn the same period 575 official complaints to 27 universities were made, including 145 alleging rape, the report said, citing FOI data. Just six resulted in expulsion.

Those policies were also often difficult to locate, confusing, out of date, inconsistent, or incomplete, it said. \nAssault victims told EROC they had been been asked what the were wearing, questioned on their drinking, their behaviour and deterred from further reporting their case. \nIn some instances they felt university staff had overtly sided with the perpetrator. \nOne woman claimed she reported an assault to university staff and that the perpetrator admitted to the assault. He was transferred to another residential college but no further action was taken. \nResponses sometimes included encouraging a victim to attempt informal resolution with a perpetrator, or contained “inappropriate” time limits on reporting, including the University of Queensland’s 40-day window for lodging grievances and the Australian Catholic University’s 20-day limit. \nThe ACU’s deputy vice-chancellor told Fairfax Media it had reviewed this policy and would update it to remove any time limit. \nAccording to the report Sydney University’s policy stated no action would be taken if an incident was reported more than 12 months later but a spokeswoman told Guardian Australia that, in practice, “each case is assessed on its merits”. \nSydney University told Guardian Australia it had acted on student feedback received last year to improve policies. \n“A comprehensive review of complaints handling was undertaken and a variety of mechanisms put in place to ensure that students can immediately avail themselves of a confidential conversation with an appropriate trained staff member and access a range of other vital support resources and services,” a spokeswoman said.

Now. Always” campaign, led by Universities Australia and the former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick. \nAll 39 Australian universities have joined the campaign to prevent and address sexual assault and harassment on campus, to increase visibility of support services and to obtain further data. \nThe current commissioner, Kate Jenkins, said the behaviour described in the report was “deplorable” and she thanked the organisation and students for sharing their experiences in the report and through the commission’s survey. \n“I am committed to achieving positive change for the women and girls in our community who experience sexual assault and sexual harassment,” Jenkins said. “The fact that the university sector, through Universities Australia, has asked the commission to undertake this work shows that they are also committed to confronting sexual assault and sexual harassment on campus.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:33:48.175+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
