Why do the SNP want to reclaim powers from Westminster – only to hand them over to Brussels Louise White \nNicola Sturgeon’s number two replied: \"There are a whole range of independent countries that have decided voluntarily to stay together as part of the European Union.” \n“Some of them are small countries like Scotland, others are larger countries but they all decide in their common interest for mutual benefit and for mutual progress. \n“If we are part of the European Union then we have access to a market of five hundred million people, which is ten times the market of the United Kingdom. \n“It’s a significant opportunity that is now going to be more difficult for us to access because of the decision to leave the European Union. BBC Mark Littlewood said it was strange the SNP wanted to shackle themselves to the EU again \n“So it’s about making sure we can assert the national interest of Scotland, which can be best served by working with other countries for mutual benefit.” \nDavid Mundell, Tory secretary of state for Scotland, hit back: “I’m always staggered when the SNP make this point about the European market and how important it is to Scotland. \n“The market in the rest of the UK is worth four times as much as all 27 other countries and this is just disregarded as if it was a mere nothing. \n“The logic just doesn’t stack up.\" \nMark Littlewood, director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs and a Brexiteer, added: \"It’s a strange one, if you want to assert your independence, to throw off the dominance of the Westminster parliament and then immediately reshackle yourself to the European Union.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:17:01.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
