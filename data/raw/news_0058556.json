During hard economic times, my mother cleaned houses for wealthier people. Newly married, I moved to Michigan and met people from the South. One of the women, also newly married, had a 2 bedroom apartment, and had moved from the South. One day she asked me to ride along while she picked up a \"maid.\" The \"maid\" refused to come, saying she wouldn't work \"for her old clothes.\" On the ride home, I asked my neighbor why she couldn't clean her own apartment. She got angry at me.It was the first time I learned about slavery. This film portrays the cruelty that was inflicted upon people that just had a different color skin. CG review by gmanggmoney “12 years a Slave” apparently took around ten years for Brad Pitt to get it in production. For some reason none of the studios wanted to make it, saying that it wasn’t a “money making” film. Well I’m glad that Brad Pitt didn’t give up and finally found a studio to support it financially because it was a masterpiece. The story is heart wrenching, the realism is astounding, and the Cinematography is beautiful. Chiwetel Ejiofor name is hard to pronounce, but I will remember it for he had a flawless performance. There are so many moments where he must suffer, or radically change moods, or even just express his feelings deeply in a manor that impacted though’s around him. There’s not a person in this film that could of done better. Steve McQueen has definitely found a spot in my mind, he will forever be noted when I hear about another film of his. He crafted, captured, and sequenced this film beyond what it had to be. I imagine it was tough for writer John Ridley who also wrote “Three Kings” and “Red Tails” to get this film historically correct. I have to say this is the first time in a long time that I agree with the “Golden Globes” and potentially “The Academy Awards” on best picture. I think this film is above worthy for best picture.This true story begins with a family man named Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who is successful and well educated. Solomon is a talented fiddle player, two men in knowledge of his talents offer him a two week job as a musician. Solomon is then unknowingly drugged and wakes up in chains. He then is sold into slavery and must survive as he goes through slave masters. He must make it through this terrible journey if he ever wants to see his family again.This film is unbelievable. The way people treated slaves back then, you think you’ve seen it already portrayed, but it’s nothing like this. This is a man who had everything and it was all taken from him. It seemed worse than someone being unlawfully put in jail. The things he went through and had to do were just hard to watch. Like I said this tragic true story was portrayed beautifully, by that I mean it was portrayed so realistically it soon becomes real. It starts to stop feeling like a film and begins to feel like your watching the events first hand. Everyone apart of this film did a great job. If your contemplating on seeing this or buying it, do it. This film is a must see, I hope you listen when I say that. Please say yes to my review I’d really appreciate it. Thanks. Almost made me cry by JoshTheAwesome101 So much hate back then wow gladly it's not that way today...
