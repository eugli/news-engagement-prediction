But the age gap between the other 10 and NWA 7635 means that there was a period of at least 2 billion years where one particular volcano was erupting. \n\"What this means is that for 2 billion years there's been sort of a steady plume of magma in one location on the surface of Mars,\" Caffee said. \n\"We don't have anything like that on Earth, where something is that stable for 2 billion years at a specific location.\" \nThe researchers aren't certain whether the meteorites came from Olympus Mons or another volcano, but it's a good candidate. It is 17 miles (27 km) tall with a footprint nearly the size of Germany. \nVolcanoes can grow so enormous on Mars because there are no plate tectonics like there are on Earth. \nAccording to NASA, Mars used to be a lot more similar to Earth than it is today, and it used to have early tectonic plates that ground past each other and formed craters and volcanoes. \nHowever, at some point in its history, Mars cooled down. Thus the molten rock beneath the plates solidified and the tectonic plate formation ground to a halt. \nNow that there appears to be no geological movement, there's less chance of eruptions being interrupted by the crust shuffling around. \nAstronauts have never walked on Mars, but thanks to these meteorites, they can still study the surface of the red planet. \nPlus, Mars has a low gravitational force and a thin atmosphere, which makes it easier for rock fragments released during impacts to fly off the planet's surface. \nHowever, these fragments don't head straight for Earth. Instead, they can orbit in space for hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions, of years, until something else in space interrupts their journey. \nThen it can still take another thousand years or so for the fragments to collide with our planet. In other words, these little meteorites have been travelling a long time to get here - and they contain some fascinating insight. \nThis article was originally published by Business Insider . \nMore from Business Insider:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:17:20.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
