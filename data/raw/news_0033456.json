Little did he know he would be emerging from the clinic just a little bit less male. \nOther less-suspecting dogs scampered as far as their leashes would allow, sniffing and jumping in blissful ignorance. And the felines, always enigmatic, quietly judged the situation from within their mesh carriers. \nAll 200 animals arrived at the Harris County Animal Shelter to get fixed for free Saturday. It was the first time the county had organized such a large event, meant to encourage residents in unincorporated areas to spay and neuter their pets and raise awareness about an ongoing overpopulation problem. \nThe shelter, already overflowing, receives 60 to 80 unwanted dogs and cats each day. Some are fostered or adopted, but not all. \n\"We've got to stop this influx of unwanted animals,\" said Michael White , director of the county's Veterinary Public Health division . \nThe shelter's adoption rate has gone up since White assumed his position about three and a half years ago, and its euthanasia rate has gone down. But its adoption rate for dogs still hovers near 75 percent, and for cats, it's much lower, he said. \nPet owners began lining up hours before the start of the \"Fix It\" event, carried out mostly by volunteers in the early hours of the day. The 200 slots filled up far quicker than expected, organizers said, and some people showed up without appointments hoping their animals could join the lineup. \nLuz Vasquez strolled through the parking lot with a manic Yorkie at the end of a leash and a quiet one in a leopard print carrier that could pass as a purse at first glance. She immediately signed both up for appointments when she heard the service would be free. \n\"It's expensive at the vet,\" she said. \nMegan Cantu 's Pomeranian mix clung to her shoulder, peeking warily from beneath long blonde eyebrows. The dog had puppies once before, challenging her owners to give them all away. \n\"It's just hard to find homes for all of them,\" Cantu said. \nNearby, a pureblood German Shepherd named Gracie basked in attention, licking anyone who ventured close enough. It wasn't always that way - she had been abandoned on Houston's north side before her new owner, Shawn Walton , took her in to join the other fosters he and his wife care for in Baytown. \nThey now have about 10 dogs, but the number changes as the animals come and go. Gracie, however, is there to stay, Walton said. \n\"She came in and was so happy to have a home,\" he said. \"She sleeps across the tops of our heads at night.\" \nInside the shelter, volunteers readied the animals for anesthesia. It's a quick procedure - 15 minutes in the hands of a skillful vet. \nIn the adjoining rooms, dogs in kennels clamored for attention from anyone who walked by. White, who fosters as many as 12 dogs at a time, put two small puppies up for adoption Saturday, adding to the roughly 270 animals that the shelter typically houses. \n\"It's important for us to find forever homes for them,\" he said.
