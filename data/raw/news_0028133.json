Joven Cagande   The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has found no armed groups in the Laguna de Bay contrary to reports that several armed men were harassing fisherfolk in the area. In a statement, Environment undersecretary and Anti-Environmental Crime Task Force (NAECTF) head Art Valdez admitted that no firearms were found in the 15 bunkhouses that officials of the DENR and the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) have jointly inspected on Friday. \"No threat was found following the operation,\" said Valdez. He, however, was quick to add that the inspection “sends a strong signal on the government's determination to see an empowered citizenry reclaiming Laguna Lake, free of intimidation or fear of reprisal\". The DENR and LLDA, together with officials of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Maritime Group and the Philippine Coast Guard conducted a surprise inspection in the Sector A of the lake covering a 2,000-hectare surface which spans from Metro Manila to San Pedro City, Laguna. A total of 15 bunkhouses occupied by workers of big fish pen operators were inspected by the authorities for possible firearms and other explosives but the operation yielded negative results. Valdez said they launched the inspection after receiving reports that several armed men were preventing fisherfolk from going in the area, especially near the fish pens. Demolition set for Valentine's Day Valdez meanwhile said a massive demolition of illegal structures is set on February 14 as part of the implementation of the one-year moratorium on operations of commercial firms in the lake. Valdez said the demolition operation will be participated not only by government troops but also by members of civil society groups. \"With members of civil society groups taking part in the demolition, the February 14 operation may well be a first in the Laguna Lake's journey,” Valdez said. On Friday, the LLDA has formally released its board resolution ordering a one-year moratorium on fish pen operations in the 90,000-hectare Laguna de Bay. In the resolution, the LLDA directed all the operators who still have fish pens and fish cages in the lake “to harvest their fish stocks and demolish their structures by March 31, 2017, otherwise, the same shall be done by the LLDA.” The moratorium was in line with President Rodrigo Duterte's directive to dismantle vast tracts of corporate and private fish pens and fish cages to give priority to small-time fisherfolk as well as to give the Laguna lake time to recuperate from massive commercial operations. Last month, the LLDA and the DENR have already dismantled fish pens in 100-hectare lake surface covering Rizal province. Valdez said they aim to finish the clearing operation by the middle of the year, in time for the president's second State of the Nation Address (SONA) in July. Valdez said that after the clearing operations, the DENR and LLDA will also address the illegal dumping of household, industrial and chemical wastes in the lake. “But the dismantling operation is just one leg of a long journey toward the lake’s revival... The dumping [of wastes] should also stop, and we need the help of various stakeholders in the lake area to make this happen,” Valdez said.
