The testimony in question was provided by a psychiatrist, Walter Quijano, who had a long history of asserting that black and Hispanic men were more likely to be dangerous in the future than their white counterparts. \n“Dr. Quijano’s testimony appealed to a powerful racial stereotype — that of black men as ‘violence prone,’ ” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. In 1997, Duane Buck was convicted of shooting and killing his ex-girlfriend, Debra Gardner, and Gardner's friend Kenneth Butler. (Texas Department of Criminal Justice via AP) \nIn Texas, jurors must unanimously agree that a person poses a risk of “future dangerousness” in order to sentence him or her to death. \n“The effect of this unusual confluence of factors was to provide support for making a decision on life or death on the basis of race,” Roberts wrote. \nBuck’s case, which has traveled up and down the federal court system for decades, will now go back to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Using new criteria laid out by the Supreme Court, the 5th Circuit will then decide whether Buck is allowed to continue with his latest appeal in a case complicated by two decades' worth of procedural complications. \nBuck, 53, was convicted in 1997 of murdering his ex-girlfriend, Debra Gardner, and one of Gardner’s friends, Kenneth Butler. Buck’s lawyers concede his guilt, but have long sought a new sentencing hearing for him -- one which does not include Quijano’s testimony. \nTexas officials are working to prevent Buck from getting a new sentencing hearing. In October, Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller argued that Buck’s case was “unusual,” but not “exceptional.” \nSeveral of justices expressed skepticism at the time .
