Top 5 / Top 10 27 Feb 2017, 12:09 IST Shockingly, James Ellsworth owns three victories versus AJ Styles \nSeven months removed from the 2016 WWE draft, it's safe to say that SmackDown Live has clearly been the superior show over Raw from week-to-week so far. Granted, Raw has been a bit better as of late, but for the first time in nearly a decade, SmackDown is relevant again and outshines the flagship show almost every week. \nFrom the WWE Championship picture all the way down to the women's division, many of the angles on the blue brand have felt fresh and have captured the attention of fans. Not only does the two-hour format give SmackDown a clear advantage, the simple storytelling and booking has also been one of the program's greatest strengths. \nHowever, to say everything SmackDown has done since the Brand Split has been perfect would be false. The blue brand hasn't been without its flaws, with these five failed storylines being its biggest blunders. #5 Dolph Ziggler's mishandled heel turn Dolph Ziggler doesn’t feel any different as a heel than he did as a babyface \nThe jury is out on this specific selection considering that there is still time for him to turn it around, but so far, Dolph Ziggler's heel turn hasn't lived up to its full potential. \nZiggler has always been a better heel than a babyface, so when he finally flipped the switch for the first time in three and a half years at the onset of 2017, it was a breath of fresh air for his character.

Fans hoped he would solidify his spot as a top villain on SmackDown once he went heel, but that hasn't been the case up to this point.
