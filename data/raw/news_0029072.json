You will no doubt be seeing this very fun and very on-point Taylor Swift look in a whole lot of backstage press photographs and dancing-in-the-audience GIFs and group Instagram selfies tonight. (Also, we hope Taylor has an Instagram video saved of the creation of this new hair style to post later, as she has done before .) Photo: From Getty Images. Lady Gaga in Marc Jacobs. Gaga pays homage to David Bowie in this Marc Jacobs outfit (Gaga—who got a Bowie tattoo over the weekend—will be performing a tribute to the late singer later in the telecast). Selena Gomez in Calvin Klein. Gomez described this Calvin Klein dress as “what would I do if I was going on a date,” which means you can expect gossip blog headline writers worldwide to somehow figure out a way to relate their write-up of her look to Justin Bieber.

Goulding—also part of the “Bad Blood” squad—is wearing a Stella McCartney dress that looks like a fairly straight-forward pink gown from the front, but reveals itself to have all kinds of excitement in the back. Fun for everyone! Bella Hadid in Alexandre Vauthier Couture. Hadid looks like someone we would see sitting in the high-school cafeteria with 7 equally intimidating friends, and we’d be scared to even look in their direction for fear of their aggressive coolness. Chrissy Teigen in Yousef Al-Jasmi. We are always a fan of the white cape look (we have a life-size poster of Gwyneth Paltrow’s Oscars Tom Ford dress on our wall). And Teigen looks excellent in this Yousef Al-Jasmi gown. Carrie Underwood in Nicolas Jebran. Underwood—looking elegant in this black Nicolas Jebran gown—is delivering what we will deem about one-third Angelina Jolie Leg here.
