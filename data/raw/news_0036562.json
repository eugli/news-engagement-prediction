Slot to 247Sports Links \nUCLA guard Lonzo Ball may be in the midst of his freshman season, but that has not stopped his confident father, Lavar Ball, from making bold statements. \nThe elder Ball's latest claim may have topped his previous proclamations, as he told TMZ that the Bruins freshman is going to be a better player than reigning two-time NBA MVP Stephen Curry. \n“Heck no!” Lavar Ball said about his oldest son potentially reaching Curry status. “He’s going to be better than Steph Curry. Steph Curry’s really good, but my son is young, he’s got time to go. And you only consider him good because he won a couple of championships. What if he didn’t win no championships? He made some shots at the right time. But he’s not as young as my boy.” \nLavar is definitely right about one thing, Lonzo — born in 1997 — is younger than Curry, who was born in 1988. However, making the claim, at least right now, that Lonzo will be better than Curry seems like parental bias at best or just an outright reach. \nCurry's 2015-16 campaign is among the best ever in NBA history. Not only did he win his second straight MVP, the Golden State Warriors point guard also became the first player to win the award unanimously. Golden State won a record-setting 73 games in the regular season, and came within a blown 3-1 lead to the Cleveland Cavaliers of winning back-to-back championships. \nThat success wasn't all Curry's doing, of course, but his ability to shoot from anywhere behind the arc has changed the way people think about basketball. Curry has set the record for three-point field goals made in each of the past three seasons. He made 402 3-pointers in the 2015-16 regular season. \nIt could be argued that Curry's three-point shooting range has influenced the Ball family as well. Lonzo, along with younger brothers LiAngelo and LaMelo , both UCLA commits, are known for being threats to shoot the ball as soon as they cross the halfcourt line. LaMelo recently scored 92 points in a game, shooting 7 of 22 from beyond the arc. \nLonzo is averaging 15.4 points, 7.6 assists and 6.1 rebounds for UCLA (23-3) this season. He's shooting 54.9 percent from the field, including an impressive 43.2 percent from three-point range. It's worth noting that Curry's career three-point percentage average over three seasons at Davidson was 41.2 percent, although he did finish at a career-high 43.9 mark in his sophomore season. \nAssuming Ball completes his freshman season healthy, he's a lock to be a lottery pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. Some might think it's best to avoid heaping a Curry comparison on Ball before he has played one second in the NBA, but that's irrelevant to his dad. \n“You won’t be able to say (that Lonzo is a better NBA player than Curry) until my boy finishes his career,\" Lavar said. Then they’ll look back and think, ‘how did LaVar know all this?’” \nIf Lonzo ends up being better than Curry, there will be a long line people for Lavar to tell, \"I told you so.\" But Lonzo at least better get close, or these quotes may come back to bite his father.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:24:38.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
