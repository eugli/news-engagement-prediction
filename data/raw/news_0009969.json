Brandon Pierce never thought it would come. Asadiq Dejesus acknowledged the day signified a promise made to his late grandmother. Maurice McCray knows now it's time to become a man. \nTuesday afternoon at Del-Val Charter, 18 young men on the Warriors football team were honored in the school's gymnasium on national signing day, with several penning national letters of intent, while still others remain undecided about which scholarship offer to accept. \n\"This is a big day for me, and I'm very excited,\" said Whittaker, a 6-foot-1, 180-pound defensive back who signed with New Hampshire. \"This is something I've envisioned every since I was young. I'm just glad that it all worked out the way it did, and I can go to a program that I want to be at and they want me.\" \nWhittaker transferred from Springfield (Montco) last year and grew close with McCray, a 6-foot-2, 228-pound linebacker who signed with Maine. Kyree Wade-McLeod, a 6-foot-5, 325-pound two-way lineman, will also play at Maine after first spending at least a year at ASA Community College. \nNext season, Whittaker's Wildcats will host McCray and Wade-McLeod's Bears on Sept. 2 to kickoff their respective seasons. \n\"This is exciting,\" McCray said. \"I finally get to go to college. It's time to grow up now. You have to do a lot on your own in college.\" \nBrandon Pierce grew up quickly. \nThe 6-foot-1, 168-pound senior from Germantown, who didn't start playing football until his senior season, said it was difficult to stay focused while growing up in the Wister Townhouses. \nIn fact, football wasn't even on his radar until the persistence of Del-Val coach Troy Gore finally paid off. \n\"Because of Coach Troy,\" said Pierce, who will play defensive back at Saint Francis. \"He'd say, 'Come on, young boy. Don't waste your talent.' He saw my talent growing up as a kid.\" \nPierce ran track - and is still a high school sprinter - but was reluctant to play football and skeptical that it could further his future. \n\"No,\" he said when asked if he believed in his early college prospects. \"I can't even [lie]. I just wanted to win a championship.\" \nThe Warriors lost in the Public League 3A championship game but later made it to the PIAA Class 3A state quarterfinals. \nLater, Pierce added: \"Growing up, it was hard. . . . Coach Troy really looked out.\" \nPierce's goal is to study criminal justice. His father, Aaron Pierce, is a member of the Philadelphia Police Department, he said. \n\"Now I just have to maintain,\" he continued. \"Hopefully I can go to the next level and go somewhere big. That's my goal right now.\" \nDejesus, a 6-foot-2, 222-pound linebacker, will play at Morgan State after at least a year of junior college at ASA Community College in New York. \nAn emotional leader on the team, Dejesus channeled his passion into forceful, aggressive play just the way his late grandmother, Indiana Foster, whose name he has tattooed on the inside of his left forearm, would have wanted. \nDejesus and Foster would watch the movie \"The Waterboy,\" an Adam Sandler film in which the lead character - also a college linebacker - channeled his rage to become a fearsome tackler. \n\"Go out there and play like you're The Waterboy,\" he recalled hearing from Foster, who died in 2014 from complications with diabetes. \"That's the mindset I have every time I step on the field.\" \nThat's not the only pledge he plans to keep. \n\"The first thing in my mind before signing that paper was that the legacy must continue,\" he said. \"When I get to college it has to be on a different level, just more Waterboy. She's watching me, so I can't let her down. I made that promise to her.\" \nAlso for the Del-Val football team: Isaiah Jones will attend Wesley College. Dashawn Boswell, Wesley College. Zamir Davis, Millersville. Tyler Hall, Millersville. Shaheed Ross, undecided. Basim Rutledge, undecided. Marlon Smith, undecided. Corey Alston, Bloomsburg. Nyshir Mackee, ASA Community College. Ari Long, ASA Community College. Fritz-Kelly Edmond, California (Pa.). Christian Davis, Lock Haven. Jymair Littles, undecided. Stephon Dowling, Wesley College. \n@AceCarterINQ February 1, 2017 — 6:12 PM EST | Updated: February 1, 2017 — 6:42 PM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.
