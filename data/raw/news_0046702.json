McMaster and Lieutenant General Robert Caslen. \nDuring his Brussels trip, Pence assured the European Union that the Trump administration would develop the bloc’s cooperation in trade and security and backed the EU as a partner in its own right, seeking to soothe anxiety prompted by Trump’s remarks a month ago renewing his endorsement of Brexit and suggesting that others might follow Britain out of the EU. \nAt the news conference, Pence also defended Trump’s repeated and strong criticisms of the news media. In a Twitter message on Saturday, Trump called the media “the enemy of the American people.” \n“The president and I both strongly support a free and independent press but you can anticipate that the president and all of us will continue to call out the media when they play fast and loose with the facts,” Pence said. \nTrump himself has been continually cited by various media for misstating facts. For instance, in his news conference last week Trump said his margin of victory in the Electoral College in November was the largest ever since fellow Republican Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 and 1984. \nIn fact, however, Democratic President Barack Obama, in both of his victories, and Republican President George H.W. Bush drew more electoral votes than did Trump. \n(Additional reporting by Robin Emmott, Robert-Jan Bartunek, Alastair Macdonald and Gabriela Baczynska in Brussels; Writing by Frances Kerry; Editing by Leslie Adler) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T21:22:58.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
