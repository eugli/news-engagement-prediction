The clearest images are in a set of 1710 mezzotints, “The Four Indian Kings,” by the British printmaker John Simon. The set depicts a delegation of tribal leaders, three Mohawk, one Mohican, shipped by the British military to London to request more troops to fight the French in North America.

Londoners gave them the equivalent of ticker-tape parades. From that point the story moves forward, at first somewhat confusingly, into the 19th century, when tattooing was largely associated with life at sea. In a label we’re told that Rowland Hussey Macy Sr. (1822-1877), the founder of Macy’s department store, was tattooed with a red star when he worked, as a youth, aboard a Nantucket whaler. And — this says something about the jumpy organization of the show’s first section — we learn from the same label that Dorothy Parker, the renowned Gotham wit, acquired a very similar tattoo in the 1930s, presumably under nonmarine circumstances, and under more humane conditions, as old-style poke-and-scratch methods had been softened by machines. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story By then tattooing had become a complex art form, and a thriving business. Ink and watercolor designs, known as flash, grew ever more wide-ranging, running from standard stars-and-stripes motifs to soft-core pornography to elevated symbolic fare (Rock of Ages; Helios, the Greek sun god), with degrees of fanciness determining price.

When Social Security numbers were first issued in the 1930s, people who had difficulty remembering them had their numbers inked onto their skin, like permanent Post-it notes. (A tattooist known as Apache Harry made numbers his specialty.) And in the 19th century, during the Civil War, a New Yorker named Martin Hildebrandt tattooed thousands of soldiers with just their names, so that, should they die in battle, as many would, their bodies could be identified. Hildebrandt was the first in a long line of revered Gotham tattoo artists, which includes Samuel O’Reilly, Ed Smith, Charlie Wagner (the “Michelangelo of Tattooing”), Jack Redcloud, Bill Jones, Frederico Gregio (self-styled as both Brooklyn Blackie and the Electric Rembrandt) and Jack Dracula (born Jack Baker), whose ambition was to be “the world’s youngest most tattooed man.” Whether he achieved his goal I don’t know, but Diane Arbus photographed him, and that’s fame enough. Hildebrandt came to a sad end; he died in a New York insane asylum in 1890. But in earlier days his shop did well, and he had a notable asset in the presence of a young woman who used the name Nora Hildebrandt. The personal nature of their relationship is a mystery, but their professional alliance is clear: He tattooed her multiple times, and he was not the only artist who did. By the 1890s, she was adorned with more than 300 designs and had become an attraction in the Barnum & Bailey Circus.

Credit New-York Historical Society Library Like many self-inventing New Yorkers, she provided herself with a colorful past: She said she’d been forcibly inked by Indians when captured as a girl. Variations on this story served other tattooed women of the era well, at least three of whom — Trixie Richardson, Ethel Martin Vangi and the lavishly self-ornamented ex-burlesque star Mildred Hull — worked “both sides of the needle,” as one of the exhibition’s witty label puts it, by becoming tattooists themselves. The show’s more coherent second half gives a fascinating account of these women, who form a kind of tattoo royalty. One, Betty Broadbent, actually came close to earning a crown. While appearing in New York’s 1939 World’s Fair, she also took part in a beauty pageant, the first ever broadcast on television. Although she didn’t end up as queen, her tattoos, which included a Madonna and Child on her back and portraits of Charles Lindbergh and Pancho Villa on either leg, were noticed. But despite such brushes with mainstream fame, tattooing was in trouble. Most New York storefront establishments were on the Bowery, which had long since became a skid row, with a reputation for crime. In 1961, in what was rumored to be an effort to clean up the city before the 1964 World’s Fair, the Health Department claimed that tattooing was responsible for a hepatitis outbreak and made it illegal.

A new generation of artists emerged, among them Thom DeVita, Ed Hardy and Tony Polito. Another of the group, Tony D’Annessa, drew his ink-and-marker designs on a vinyl window shade — it’s in the show — which could be quickly rolled up in the event of a police raid. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story As the 1960s proceeded, tattooing gained fresh cachet precisely because of its anti-establishment status, and that continued into the punk wave of the 1980s, which reclaimed the Bowery as rebel territory. By the globalist 1990s, when the tattoo ban ended, the non-Western sources of much of this art, particularly Japanese, was attracting attention. So was the vivid work, much of it reflecting Latin American culture, coming out of prisons. The former underground gained high visibility. Artists like Spider Webb (Joseph O’Sullivan) and Thomas Woodruff, who came up through the tattoo world, made a transition to commercial galleries. New work by several young artists in the show — Mario Desa, Flo Nutall, Chris Paez, Johan Svahn, William Yoneyama and Xiaodong Zhou — seems pitched as much to the wall as to skin. And the gradual entry of tattoos into museums began the process of mainstreaming that has made the genre widely popular, but also watered down. Not completely watered down, though. Native American artists are again making the form their own. And, as was true a century ago, the participation of women is a crucial spur to this art. Ruth Marten began tattooing in the early 1970s for a largely punk and gay clientele — she inked both the musician Judy Nylon and the drag star Ethyl Eichelberger — and merged live tattooing with performance art, an idea the exhibition will explore with tattooing demonstrations in the gallery. The nonprofit organization P.Ink (Personal Ink) periodically organizes workshops that specialize in tattoo sessions for breast cancer survivors who have had mastectomies but reject reconstructive surgery. Photographs of scar-ornamenting and covering designs by Miranda Lorberer, Ashley Love, Joy Rumore and Pat Sinatra are in the show, along with testimonials from grateful clients.
