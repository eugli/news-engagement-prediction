( Scorecard ) \nAustralian skipper Steve Smith studied the pitch and concluded the ball would turn from Day 1 while his India counterpart Virat Kohli felt the turn would be slow. \nAs it turned out, Smith and everyone else was right. The pitch did turn appreciably from the second over of the day when R Ashwin was introduced into the attack with the new ball. \nAustralia's openers David Warner and Matt Renshaw did well to negate India's spin threat but Jayant Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja and Ashwin struck in the second session as Australia went to tea five down. ( Why Australia should be afraid of Virat Kohli ) \nShane Warne, one of the architects of Australia's 2004 series win here in India, felt the pitch could make the contest a level playing field. The legendary leg-spinner said he had never seen a pitch like the one in Pune before the start of a Test match. \n\"I was talking to Ravi Shastri for the pitch report and I don't think we have ever seen a pitch like that before the start of a Test match,\" Warne told cricket.com.au. \n\"It looks like a Day 8 pitch before the first ball has been bowled. It hasn't been watered for four days apparently. Phew! It's gonna be a quick one.\" ( Virat Kohli focussed on next target: 'Our minds and hearts on Australia series' ) \nWarne, one of the shrewdest readers of the game in world cricket, said Ashwin would be a big threat for the Aussies but he refused to count out the pacers on this surface. \nWarne felt the pacers could make an impact with the low, uneven bounce. Australia are playing Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood while India have fielded fast bowlers Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav. The latter made the first breakthrough for the hosts with the wicket of David Warner.
