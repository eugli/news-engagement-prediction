(Photo: Ludovic Bertron/Special for The Republic) \nArizona could lose business, tourism and give itself another national black eye if it doesn't extend job, housing and public-service protections to all Arizonans, a coalition of community groups and Democrats said Monday.\nIt's well past time for a law that protects people based on their sexual orientation, gender identity and veteran status, the two Democratic leaders at the Legislature said at a Capitol news conference.\n\"This legislation has been introduced since 2008 and has never even received the respect of a hearing,\" said House Minority Leader Rebecca Rios, D-Phoenix. \"Enough is enough.\"\nRios introduced House Bill 2364 , which is awaiting assignment to a committee. Katie Hobbs, the Senate minority leader, has an identical measure, SB 1320 , that is before a Senate committee, although no hearing is yet scheduled.\nThey rallied leaders from churches, business and the civil-rights groups to urge the public to contact lawmakers and demand action.\nSen. Steve Smith, R-Maricopa, chairs the committee to which Hobbs' bill was assigned. He did not return a call inquiring whether he will bring it up for public discussion and a vote.\nHouse Speaker J.D. Mesnard's office said the speaker intends to send the bill to a committee for consideration, but did not offer details.\nThe bills would add sexual orientation, gender identity and veteran status to the categories that are protected from discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations, such as hotels, restaurants and other businesses that serve the public.\nRELATED: AZ bills would ban coverage for gender-reassignment surgeries already denied by state | Mesa calls anti-discrimination pledge a message of diversity | In AZ, clash over LGBT rights plays out at city level | Study: AZ has more transgender adults than U.S. average \nOpposition to anti-discrimination measures While the bill has strong backing from Democrats, who are in the minority at the Legislature, Republicans have largely kept silent on the matter. The Governor's Office has not made a call for a change, although Gov. Doug Ducey said he does not support discrimination in any form.\n\n“The evidence is not there that states that do not have such (an anti-discrimination) law are being harmed.”\nCathi Herrod, president of the socially conservative Center for Arizona Policy At an event last week to tout the upcoming NCAA Final Four tournament, Ducey evaded questions as to whether gay and transgender individuals should receive protections, and suggested he was not going to sway lawmakers.\n“I’ve said that I’m against discrimination in all its forms,” he told reporters, adding, “I want to see opportunity for all. … I’m not in the habit of telling the Legislature and other elected officials what they should be doing.”\nThe Center for Arizona Policy has staunchly opposed such measures, and opposes the Rios and Hobbs bills, said Cathi Herrod, president of the socially conservative group.\n\"These laws limit the private-property rights of individuals, and the rights of businesses,\" she said. As for arguments that the lack of such a law hurts states economically, Herrod said there's no proof.\n\"The evidence is not there that states that do not have such a law are being harmed, \" she said, adding that states like Arizona and Texas are doing fine with their existing policies.\nSome cities are watching the Legislature for action on the issue. The Mesa City Council couldn't reach a consensus about passing a municipal anti-discrimination ordinance and Mayor John Giles said earlier in January that the city would work with the Legislature on a statewide measure.\nNational attention from SB 1062 Arizona drew national attention, and widespread condemnation, when the Legislature in 2014 passed Senate Bill 1062. It would have offered a legal defense for individuals and businesses in discrimination lawsuits if they proved they had acted on a “sincerely held religious belief.”\nSupporters billed it as a religious-freedom bill; opponents said it would be a license to discriminate. Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed the bill under intense pressure from the business community.\n“Each and every person should be able to earn an honest living ... without fear of repercussions or judgment or being denied a place to live in peace.”\nThe Rev. Troy Mendez, dean of the Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Phoenix In recent years, organizations have increasingly signaled they don't want to do business in places without these protections.\nThe NCAA last fall withdrew its plans to hold any championship tournament games in North Carolina after that state's legislature passed a law that rolled back some protections for lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual people.\nThe NCAA now asks the sponsors of prospective events to demonstrate how their venues are \"safe, healthy and free\" of discrimination, a policy established after Glendale landed the Final Four tournament .\nKate Van Horn is the vice president of diversity and inclusion at Scottsdale-based GoDaddy. She said the lack of a state law extending job protections to all classes of people hampers job recruitment, even though GoDaddy has an open hiring process.\nThe Rev. Troy Mendez, dean of the Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Phoenix, said the legislation calls on Arizonans \"to be our best selves.\"\n\"Each and every person should be able to earn an honest living ... without fear of repercussions or judgment or being denied a place to live in peace,\" Mendez said.\nReach the reporter at maryjo.pitzl@arizonarepublic.com and follow her on Twitter, @maryjpitzl . \nReporter Yvonne Wingett Sanchez contributed to this article.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:43:37.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
