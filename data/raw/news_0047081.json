In fact, as a conservative, I find it even more irritating when other conservatives engage in this race to register the most indignant social media reaction to breaking stories.\nI suspect this shared disdain for politically correct virtue-signaling is what attracted so many conservatives to Milo Yiannopoulos in the first place, and I urge them not to adapt it in their reactions to his disinvitation from the Conservative Political Action Conference.\nOver the past couple of years, Yiannopoulos' articulate and unapologetic takedowns of the political correctness advanced by elitists in both parties resonated powerfully and were especially alluring to conservatives coming from a homosexual British Catholic with Jewish heritage, a living rebuttal to the Left's narrative that their opponents are all humorless simpletons who prey on marginalized people.\nMuch ink can and will be spilled analyzing CPAC's decision to disinvite Yiannopoulos from speaking this week.\nThe conference was given an unfortunate gift in the form of an old video dredged from the depths of the internet where Yiannopoulos, himself a victim of sexual abuse, appeared to defend the practice of older men having sex with teenage boys.\nThat made CPAC's decision easy.\nIn a statement announcing the disinvitation , American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp explained, \"we initially extended the invitation knowing that the free speech issue on college campuses is a battlefield where we need brave, conservative standard-bearers.\"\nThat is accurate. But Milo Yiannopoulos is not, and has never been, a conservative standard-bearer.\nHe is open about that.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Republican bills to kill federal agencies face uphill battle Education Department, EPA and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are each targeted.\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 02/20/17 5:04 PM Yiannopoulos is a smart libertarian polemicist who traffics in hyperbole that happens to align with conservatives' stance on political correctness. Allowing him to implicitly represent conservatism behind College Republican podiums has been profoundly confusing for thousands of young people who are working to forge the set of beliefs that will inform their decisions for decades to come.\nAs someone who genuinely enjoyed his humor as early as the Gamergate controversy that rocketed him to prominence, I saw it as all great fun until conservatives began to claim Yiannopoulos as their own, allowing him to speak for us.\nI could spend days outlining the myriad ways Yiannopoulos damaged the conservative movement, and the temptation is strong, but we've allowed ourselves to be distracted by him for long enough.\nIt is now time to move on.\nEmily Jashinsky is a commentary writer for the Washington Examiner. \nAlso from the Washington Examiner Passengers walk through JFK airport security, metal detectors buzzing None of the travelers were to be found.\nBy Kelly Cohen • 02/20/17 4:50 PM Top Story Trump names Lt.
