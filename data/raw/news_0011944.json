In other words, he was the perfect choice for singing the anthem before America’s biggest nationally televised frat party.\nWhereas Gaga went over the top with a 2-minute, 23-second performance, Bryan – dressed down for the occasion in jeans and v-neck shirt -- kept his version steady and stately. There were no ululations or bouts of over-singing, other than a long held “br ve” at the finish, which tipped his anthem past the two minute mark, at 2:04. \nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. \nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:02:10.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
