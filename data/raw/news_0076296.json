HAT TRICK for Harry Kane!!! He becomes the first-ever Spurs player to notch four career Premier League hat tricks for the club. pic.twitter.com/bCkATBep9H \n— NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) February 26, 2017 \nKane could have had even more, but if not for Lee Grant and a couple shots that came so close they may as well have kissed the post. But, just for good measure, Kane did toss in an assist when he made an absurd touch to dispose of Bruno Martins-Indi, before crossing for Dele Alli to finish with ease. \nIf we’re talking about complete and generally dominant matches, Kane’s performance against Stoke matches anything we’ve seen in the Premier League this season. \nThe timing couldn’t be any better for Tottenham either. They’re out of the Europa League and only a top four finish can get them into next season’s Champions League. Their attack has sputtered a bit of late in the Premier League and, while they once looked like the second-best team in England, they had found themselves on the verge of slipping to fifth or even sixth. But that’s the case no more. \nSpurs are back into second place and Kane on top of the scoring chart. Things are looking up again, and Kane is the biggest reason why. If he can stay red hot — and he’s been pretty remarkable whenever fit this season — Tottenham have to feel good about their top four chances. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T18:28:55.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
