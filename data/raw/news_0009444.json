India and China, in that order, are the top two countries from which H-1B recipients hail, Stock said. \nThe government sets an annual cap of 85,000 H-1B visas, which includes 20,000 for foreign workers with U.S. advanced degrees. In 2016, the cap was reached in just one week , for the fourth consecutive year, with more than 200,000 H-1B applications filed. \nRELATED: Less Than a Week After Applications Opening, 2017 H-1B Visa Cap Hit \nA lottery is used to decide who receives the visas, which are good at the sponsoring company for up to three years. H-1Bs can be extended for an additional three years. \nAs immigration takes center stage in the first month of Donald Trump's presidency, how to attract what some lawmakers call the \"best and brightest\" through the H-1B visa program has been the subject of much debate. Federal lawmakers have adopted varying approaches to reforming the program with their legislation. \nRep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), for instance, reintroduced a bill last month to help stop the outsourcing of jobs. It calls for boosting the H-1B annual salary requirement from $60,000 to $100,000 and eliminating the master's degree exemption, according to a statement from his office. H-1B applicants, he said, have abused this by obtaining low-quality certificates to meet the standard. \n\"By raising the salary to a level more in-line with the average American salary for these positions, it would help cut down on abuse and ensure these positions remain available for companies who truly need them,\" the statement reads. \nRep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) introduced her own bill that would award visas according to which employers offer the highest salary. It also calls for removing a country cap on employment-based immigrant visas and would apportion 20 percent of H-1B visas annually for small businesses or startups. intro'd new bill today to curb H-1B abuse and high-skilled job outsourcing: https://t.co/mOAUchh7tb â€” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (@RepZoeLofgren) January 24, 2017 \n\"It offers a market-based solution that gives priority to those companies willing to pay the most,\" she said in a statement . \"This ensures American employers have access to the talent they need, while removing incentives for companies to undercut American wages and outsource jobs.\" \nAnd a bill from Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Dick Durbin (D-Il) seeks to ensure American workers are not undercut by cheap labor. \nFor H-1B visas, it would establish a system that gives preference to foreign students educated in the U.S., to advanced degree holders, to those paid a high wage, and to workers with valuable skills. \nThe bill would also go after outsourcing companies that use visa programs to temporarily bring over large numbers of foreign workers for training, only to send them back home to perform the same job.
