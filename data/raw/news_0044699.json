What's not so clear is just how bad the affordable housing situation in the city has become.\nJust eight out of 40 Seattle neighborhoods are within reach for households earning the median salary in the city, which is $80,349, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 American Community Survey.\nWe crunched the numbers on the bare minimum annual income you'd need to earn to pay a mortgage on a home in 40 Seattle neighborhoods. The figure roughly factors in property taxes and homeowners insurance, but does not include living expenses, utilities or transportation costs. It also assumes the home is move-in ready and doesn't need any maintenance, upgrades or expensive remodeling.\nNew data shows the divide between housing prices and median incomes can make it extra tough to buy in some U.S. counties. Patrick Jones (@Patrick_E_Jones) explains.\nMedia: MediaOS Video After seeing the numbers, it's no surprise why Seattle continues to be an untouchable market for many would-be buyers. The median sale price for all Seattle homes sold in the past 30 days according to Redfin is $572,000. That means a buyer would need to pull in around $100,000 annually to afford a home, which is well above the median salary.\nIt's also worth noting that hundreds of thousands of Seattleites earn less than the median household income, which makes the dream of home ownership just that -- a dream.\nPrices in King County continue to grow, too. A report on the 2016 housing market produced by the Northwest Multiple Listing Service showed King County claimed the highest median sale price of the 23 counties in the NWMLS service area, at $489,000 for single-family homes and condos. In 2015, that figure was $432,000.\nRelated Stories 3 Seattle homes listed below the King County median price West Seattle starter homes on the market How much home prices have increased in your Seattle neighborhood Those who look outside the city are rewarded. The NWMLS report shows the 2016 median sale price of homes and condos just north in Snohomish County is $370,000. In Pierce County, that figure is $272,500.\nBut moving isn't an option for everyone, and those who move but maintain jobs in the city must contend with long, often costly commutes. A recent survey from INRIX revealed Seattle drivers spend 55 hours in traffic every year . The company also found traffic congestion cost Seattle drivers $1,509 annually.\nTo calculate the neighborhood figures, we assumed a 20-percent down payment on a 30-year mortgage and a 3.75-percent interest rate. Then we plugged the numbers into Zillow's mortgage calculator. We also assumed the mortgage was roughly 30 percent of a person's annual income, based on guidelines set by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (with that, some have noted the 30 percent rule is basically useless because millions of American households spend much more on their mortgage).\nThe median home sale price comes from the past month of data for each neighborhood according to Redfin.\nScroll through the slideshow above to see figures for all 40 Seattle neighborhoods (and try not to cry too much).\nBonus points: We calculated these figures back in October 2016 for 35 Seattle neighborhoods. You can see how the figures compare here.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/57/14/42/12372146/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/57/07/51/12352125/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/47/55/73/10411769/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-17/housings-30-percent-of-income-rule-is-near-useless"], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:26:44.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
