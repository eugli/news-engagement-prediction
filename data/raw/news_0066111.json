Plus, the airport is a restricted area that cannot be conveniently trespassed (by anyone),\" he told Bernama . \nBadlisham said MAHB was now working with the government on the case and had handed over the copy of the recording to the police on Feb 14. \n\"The master copy is still with us as we are the operator for KLIA2,\" he said. Badlisham said MAHB would conduct its investigation accordingly including, identifying the individual(s) who had entered the CCTV recording room on the day of the incident. \n\"We will investigate who was on duty on that day and unauthorised person(s) who entered the room,\" he said. \nAccording to Badlisham, the airport operator would also find out whether the recording was taken via a mobile phone or other means. \n\"MAHB will not take this matter lightly and rest assured that we will take the sternest action possible against the culprit(s),\" he said. \nFollowing the incident, he has issued instructions for security control in the CCTV rooms at all airports operating under MAHB to be heightened.\"This includes not allowing unauthorised persons and mobile phones into the room, as well as to sign (in logbook) as a proof of attendance,\" he said. \nOn Feb 13, Jong-nam was in KLIA2 to board a flight to Macau when a woman suddenly covered his face with a cloth laced with poison. \nJong-nam, the elder half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un who had carried a passport with the name of Kim Chol, died while being rushed to the Putrajaya hospital. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:57:38.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
