This image was captioned: 'Technical difficulties with a roller coaster and this guy's job is to ride it alone and see what's wrong with it. Worst job ever' It is not known exactly where this office is located, but it's likely you've never worked with such little desk space And finally, at least the owner of this sewage transporter has a sense of humour, with the slogan: '#1 Company in the #2 business' Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:31:35.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
