Lorna Gordon (@bbclornag) BBC DG Tony Hall says #BBCScotland channel will reflect how Scotland is changing politically, culturally and creatively #scottishnine February 22, 2017 \nIt will be shown between 7pm and midnight, and include a nightly Scottish-led hour-long news and current affairs programme aired at 9pm. Hall said the channel would lead to 80 new jobs based in Scotland. \nBBC Scotland has spent more than a year on developing a “news hour” type programme to replace the Six O’Clock News on BBC1, commissioning a series of pilot shows using different formats, in the belief it would soon see a “Scottish Six” aired every night. \nThere were reports at the weekend that the Scottish Six proposal had been killed off by Hall and other BBC executives in London, with commentators and the National Union of Journalists furious there would be no substantial new investment in Scottish current affairs programming. \nThe substantial reforms follow intense debate about the quality and range of BBC programming and spending in Scotland. Only about 55% of the £320m raised from Scottish licence fee payers is spent in Scotland, the lowest proportion among the four nations of the UK. \nBBC executives have admitted that the corporation has failed to keep pace with devolution across the UK, or reflect the different political systems now operating in different nations and regions.
