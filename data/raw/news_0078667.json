(Reuters) \nWhatever the reason, it’s been a cue for endless jokes and hilarity around the world. \nFor London-headquartered PwC, it’s anything but funny. \nAccording to Nigel Currie, an independent London-based branding specialist with decades’ worth of industry experience, this mistake is “as bad a mess-up as you could imagine.” \n“They had a pretty simple job to do and messed it up spectacularly,” he said. “They will be in deep crisis talks on how to deal with it.” \nBrands go to extraordinary lengths to protect their image and reputation and to be seen as good corporate citizens. History is littered by examples when a hard-won reputation nosedives — from sporting legends Tiger Woods and Lance Armstrong to business giants like BP following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster. \nCurrie says PwC has no other option than to front-up immediately and explain exactly what happened to contain the damage to its reputation. \n“They are absolutely in the spotlight for next week and for longer probably as it unfolds,” he said. “They have to show what happened.” Read more Oscar 2017 goof-up: Manoj N Shyamalan jokes he directed the twist in the end Producer Jordan Horowitz holds up the card for the Best Picture winner \"Moonlight.\" On left is Ryan Gosling and right is presenter Warren Beatty who mistakenly announced \"La La Land\" as the best picture winner. (REUTERS) \nPwC, which was formerly known as PricewaterhouseCoopers and originated in London over a century ago, was quick to apologise to the movies involved, Beatty, Dunaway and viewers, but has yet to fully explain what happened. \n“The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and, when discovered, was immediately corrected,” it said in a statement. “We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.” \nIn fact, it took over two minutes on air, during which time the “La La Land” team gave three acceptance speeches, before PwC corrected the mistake on stage. \nPwC’s representatives were Brian Cullinan, a partner at the firm — and, according to his bio on the company’s website, a Matt Damon lookalike — and Martha Ruiz, the second woman to serve as a PwC Oscars tabulator. \nCullinan is the lead partner for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, including the annual balloting for the Oscars ceremony. He has been part of the balloting team since 2014. \nRuiz, a 19-year veteran at PwC who specializes in providing tax compliance and advisory services to entertainment clients in southern California, joined Cullinan as the Oscars balloting co-leader in 2015.

(AP) \nIn a promotional video on the company’s website ahead of Sunday’s show, Cullinan said he and Ruiz are the only two who knew who the winners were on the night of the awards. \n“There are 24 categories. We have the winners in sealed envelopes that we hold and maintain throughout the evening and hand those to the presenters before they walk out on stage,” he said. \nBoth Cullinan and Ruiz would have had a briefcase on either side of the auditorium to hand out the envelope for the category to be announced. \nCullinan said PwC’s relationship with the Academy Awards is testament to the firm’s reputation in the market for being “a firm of integrity, of accuracy and confidentiality and all of those things that are really key to the role we have with the Academy in counting these ballots.” \n“But I think it’s really symbolic of how we’re thought of beyond this role and how our clients think of us and I think it’s something we take very seriously and take a lot of pride in.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:38:23.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
