They might be unsealed as soon as Wednesday , according to Daniel Stevens, acting executive director of the Campaign for Accountability. \nIn the tape, Fierstein does not detail her accusations of physical abuse — accusations she had leveled two years earlier in a petition seeking $350,000 in damages. In that petition, Fierstein said Puzder \"assaulted and battered me by striking me violently about the face, chest, back, shoulders and neck, without provocation or cause,\" leaving “bruises and contusions to the chest, back, shoulders and neck” and “two ruptured discs and two bulging discs,” among other injuries. \nThe judge in the case dismissed the petition on the grounds that Puzder's divorce agreement had already settled all Fierstein's prior claims against him. \n\"I wound up losing everything, everything,\" Fierstein said on Oprah. \"I have nothing. He has a Porsche and a Mercedes-Benz. He has the home. He has everything. He was an attorney and he knew how to play the system.\" \nFierstein spoke mostly in broad terms on Oprah about the effect the abuse had, she said, on herself, and the effect such abuse has on women in general. By Nolan D. McCaskill \n\"Most men who are in positions like that don't leave marks,\" Fierstein said. \"The damage that I sustained you can't see. It's permanent ... They don't hit you in the face. They're too smart. They don't hit you in front of everyone.\" \nIn response Tuesday, Thompson said: \"This supports their collective claims that Andy was never physically abusive.\" \nIn a Jan. 18 letter to the Senate HELP Committee, Fierstein said she was contacted by producers for Oprah after details of her divorce were made public in the St. Louis press, an apparent reference to a 1989 article in the Riverfront Times detailing her abuse allegations. \"They asked me to appear as a panel member to discuss the issue of adult abuse. I was hesitant but encouraged by friends and became caught up in the notion of a free trip to Chicago and being a champion of women and women's issues.\" \n\"I regret my decision to appear on that show,\" she wrote. \"I never told Andy about it.\" \nPOLITICO obtained a copy of the tape from Charlotte Fedders, a once-famous victim of domestic abuse whose story, when it landed on page one of the Wall Street Journal in 1985, swiftly ended then-husband John Fedders' tenure as chief of enforcement at Ronald Reagan's Securities and Exchange Commission. Fedders appeared with Fierstein on the 1990 Oprah episode. \n\"I totally believe that she was abused,\" Charlotte Fedders said Tuesday. \"Powerful men have a way of convincing you that they didn't do it. I do believe that she was abused.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:09:15.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
