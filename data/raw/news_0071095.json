He most recently worked in Arizona, before bringing his family to Michigan about six months ago and starting work at Shalimar , 307 S. Main St. \n\"With that knowledge in mind and the Indian touch, I'm trying to give people something new,\" Zarapkar said. \nSomething new is what he describes as a fusion of northern Indian with American touches. \n\"Right now, people like fusion food. There is lots of exciting stuff on the menu,\" Zarapkar said. \nSome of those entrees are the Duck Gushtaba, ground duck dumplings stuffed with goat cheese and spices and then cooked in a yogurt-based sauce, and the Crab Makhni, crab claw meat in a tangy butter and tomato sauce. \n\"These are completely different; no one can copy that. It's my own secret recipes,\" Zarapkar said. \nHis wife is from Michigan originally, and he often used her as a guinea pig to taste-test the recipes and make sure the spice levels are appropriate for American taste buds. \n\"I forced-fed my wife,\" Zarapkar joked. \"So if she gives me a green signal, it can go on the menu.\" \nCustomer favorites like the Chicken Tikka Masala have not changed, Zarapkar said, but he is making an effort to include more unique dishes and more seafood options. There are a few things he has tested that will not end up on the final menu. \n\"Venison,\" Zarapkar said about what guests have not encouraged him to pursue. \"And goat. They want to have goat as a pet, not on the plate.\" \nNick Patel is in charge of operations for the restaurant, owned by Shailesh and Pankaj Patel, and said Zarapkar is a great fit for Shalimar because of his culinary skills and approachable personality. \n\"He comes out to know the customers,\" Patel said. \"He's always caring and looking for the customers who comes in, and considers negative and positive feedback to improve. He connects well with the customers.\" \nZarapkar is currently training Shalimar staff on how to prepare and plate the new specials. The new menu is tentatively scheduled for a March 23 launch, said manager Shivi Raj, and will have labels for each menu item so guests can identify gluten-free and dairy-free options among others. \nIn 2015, Shalimar brought back the lunch buffet due to customer demand. Rotating dishes are included on the lunch buffet, including some vegetarian dishes and salad and soup options. \nShalimar Indian restaurant in Ann Arbor adding lunch buffet \nSome of Zarapkar's specials are going to be included in the lunch buffet, and he said he manages to sneak in some more classical French-style items on the weekend buffet, like green beans. \nThere are also plans to renovate the restaurant, to adjust some of the decor and color scheme, but Raj said the restaurant will maintain the same atmosphere that has brought guests back year after year. \n\"It's the ambiance,\" in addition to the food,\" Raj said. \"The taste is so authentic, you taste it and it feels like home.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:07:02.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
