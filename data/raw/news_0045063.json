But I also think it's important for people to look at this image and think how much struggle have some of these women gone through, how much of their story might not be so triumphant.\" \nMills said she also wanted to broaden what constitutes \"success\" and commemorate the women who make small but mighty and meaningful change to their communities. \n\"Success is many different things. It doesn't only mean that you have a corner office and a PhD.\" \n\"For me, I really hope that I'm helping to make HERstory by showing the city and this country a different face of leadership.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:32:34.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
