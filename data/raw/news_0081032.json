Much like the best “Bachelor” moments that came before it, we hit peak sound-off on Twitter faster than you can whip up a serving of cheese pasta . \nSome demanded answers: Why the turtleneck? Others questioned whether a man in a turtleneck could bring any woman, specifically a woman who has never orgasmed, to climax. Others made some excruciatingly fitting ‘NSYNC comparisons that we can never un-see. \nCheck out all our favorite LOL-worthy tweets about Nick’s turtleneck below. — Emma Gray (@emmaladyrose) February 28, 2017 Raven: I've never had an ONick: Well, I'm wearing a turtleneck so you're barking up the wrong tree. #TheBachelor #recap", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:05:19.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
