Chicago residents will weigh in on it, Chicago aldermen will vote whether to approve it and Chicago benefactors will be asked to open their wallets to support it.\nSo it would be reasonable to think that the first hints about the project's design would be dropped somewhere in Chicago â€” at the Museum of Science and Industry, say, or under the Chicago Cultural Center's Tiffany dome. \nNope. \nTo the frustration of Chicago journalists, me included, who've been denied interviews for months now by media handlers for the Obama library, those hints were divulged last week at an event at New York's Lincoln Center that honored Tod Williams and Billie Tsien , the library's Manhattan-based architects. \nInterviewed by Paul Goldberger, the New York architecture critic who advised the Obama Foundation on the architect selection process for the library, Williams and Tsien revealed conceptual ideas for the project, said Obama critiqued an early plan of theirs as too quiet and speculated that the library could require a whopping $1.5 billion to cover construction, endowment and other costs.

(Blair Kamin) \nThat last bit of information, reported by the New York Post's Page Six column, spread quickly on the Web as other media zeroed in the possibility that the Obama Presidential Center, as the library is officially known, might cost three times as much as the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:03:34.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
