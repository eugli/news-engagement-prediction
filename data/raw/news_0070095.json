Not in full, but still. Now our Youth Army guys can storm not just any old thing but the actual building.” \nThe Youth Army was created in 2015, to allow children as young as 10 to receive basic military training and “patriotic education”. President Vladimir Putin’s opening of Patriot Park the same year fits into a pattern of increased Russian nationalism following the 2014 annexation of Crimea. \nThe park also features copies of Russian military hardware, as well as exhibition space, shops and military-themed video games. In recent years, the Soviet victory in the second world war has become a key part of Putin’s ideology, used as a national rallying point. Victory Day, 9 May, has become one of the most celebrated days in the Russian calendar. \nThe raising of the Soviet flag atop the Reichstag is one of the most iconic images of the Soviet war victory. On Victory Day 2015, the Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, had a mock-up of the Reichstag constructed in the centre of Grozny . Soldiers in period Soviet uniforms rushed towards it, shooting costumed Nazis dead as they went. After the building was “seized”, the Soviet soldiers marched Nazi soldiers through the streets and tossed Swastika flags and other Nazi banners at Kadyrov’s feet. \nShoigu did not specify when the new Reichstag model would be completed, and whether members of the public would also be able to recreate the storming or only members of the Youth Army. \nDuring his speech to the Duma, Shoigu also mentioned that the Russian army now had a cyber-division whose task was to counter foreign propaganda about Russia . Shoigu said counter-propaganda should be “clever, competent and effective”. \nThere are increasing fears in Europe about potential Russian meddling in elections, after US intelligence agencies accused hackers working for the Russian government of hacking the Democratic party’s servers in the run-up to last November’s US election, apparently with the aim of helping Donald Trump get elected.
