(Photo: Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports) \n304 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Terry Bradshaw had yogurt for breakfast on Monday morning. He says he was careful not to get any on his clothes.\n“Hey, you know what?” he says suddenly. “I do have coffee on my shirt — I just noticed.”\nAnd then Bradshaw lets out a guffaw, long and loud, just like the one you know from FOX NFL Sunday where he yuks it up with Howie and Jimmy and Michael and Curt, men’s men who love to laugh.\n“When I have to go wash this shirt I’m going to get my Tide out,” Bradshaw tells USA TODAY Sports. “And here we go, you know what I mean?”\nYou do if you watched the Super Bowl. That’s where Bradshaw appeared on the broadcast and in one of the day’s most-liked commercials. In fact, at one point it was hard to tell where one ended and the other began, a meta moment for the digital age.\nBradshaw and Curt Menefee appeared in a quick spot to promote the halftime show and Bradshaw had a big barbecue stain on his white dress shirt. The internet almost short-circuited. A couple of commercial breaks later, all was made clear. The stain was the beginnings of a clever commercial for Tide.\nAD METER: WATCH ALL THE COMMERCIALS \nUSA TODAY\nWatch all the 2017 Super Bowl commercials\nUSA TODAY\nHyundai's 'live' commercial puts deployed soldiers at Super Bowl with families\nMenefee points to the stain. Bradshaw vamooses to get it clean. He runs across the field as the game goes on. He exits the stadium in a golf cart, gets forced off the highway by a truck and crashes into the front yard of Jeffrey Tambor, who uses Tide to get the stain out — and his basset hound face to mine for more laughs.\nOh, and that stain? It was the real deal. “No watercolor or anything,” Bradshaw says. “It was real barbecue sauce, Jack. I tasted it.”\nThe surprise 60-second spot finished fifth in USA TODAY’s Ad Meter, an annual consumer vote.\n“I haven’t been top 5 in anything in my life,” Bradshaw says. “How cool is that?”\nThis from a man who was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1970 NFL draft and won four Super Bowls. That was the quarterback record, shared with Joe Montana and Tom Brady, until Brady won his fifth on Sunday.\n“I’m so fine with this,” Bradshaw says. “I was so happy for him. I had my moment. I could have gotten my five or six, but I didn’t. He did — and in such dramatic fashion. I harbor no jealousy. You have to admire this and put it in its proper category.”\nThat category is greatest quarterback of all time. Bradshaw says he loves Montana but Brady is the best.\n“They can’t find his jersey,” Bradshaw says. “You know where his jersey is? I got it. I’m washing it right now with my Tide, right here in the laundry room. I’m going to send it back to him after I get it clean.”\nYou could say Brady and Bradshaw won the Super Bowl, one on the field and the other in the ads.\n“Well, I got fifth,” Bradshaw says, then reconsiders. “Wait, there you go. There’s my fifth ring right there — a ring around the collar.”\nPHOTOS: BEST OF THE SUPER BOWL \nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Patriots win Super Bowl LI with epic rally   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
