But they never intended to keep him on their 40-man roster and thus knew there was a possibility he could be lost when they made Walker available by trying to get him through waivers. \nThe Braves 40-man roster now includes 39 players. It doesn't appear they have plans to imminently fill this void. Instead, they'll likely use the flexibility to expand their options as they decided whether to add another potential bench candidate. \nWalker batted .243 with 27 home runs and a .784 OPS for Minnesota's Triple-A Rochester affiliate last season. He has tallied at least 25 home runs during each of his first four full seasons in the Minors. But he has also produced a 2.54 walk-to-strikeout ratio as he has struck out 744 times and drawn 189 walks through 2,449 plate appearances. \nWhile collecting 560 plate appearances with Double-A Chattanooga in 2015, Walker tallied a career-high 31 homers, struck out 195 times and drew 51 walks. The 27 homers last season were tarnished by the fact he also struck out 202 times and drew 44 walks over 531 plate appearances. has covered the Braves for MLB.com since 2001.
