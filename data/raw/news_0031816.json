This is so crazy,\" she shared with the audience during her acceptance speech. \"Thank you to the recording academy.\" \nThe 26-year-old continued, \"11 years ago, I went to the first-ever Grammy camp. It was the first time I ever flew on a plane by myself to L.A. and it's crazy to be here a decade later.\" Photos \nGrammys 2017 Red Carpet Arrivals \nIn addition to being nominated for four awards including Best New Artist, Maren was also scheduled to sing with Alicia Keys in a once-in-a-lifetime performance. \n\"We're singing the last song on my record called 'Once.' I've never performed it on TV. So this is the first time we're doing it,\" Maren explained to Giuliana Rancic on Live From the Red Carpet . \"I love her so much. We met on CMT's Crossroads a couple months ago and just sort of bonded. So this is a really organic way to come back together for my first Grammys.\" \nBefore she takes to the stage again, however, Maren will simply take a moment to enjoy her new title as Grammy winner. \n\"Thank you so much. This is amazing,\" she shared during her speech while trying to hold back tears. \"And the fans. Thank you for giving me the most incredible year of my life.\" Following the 2017 Grammys on CBS, tune back in to E! for our live After Party special at 11:30 p.m. ET/PT.
