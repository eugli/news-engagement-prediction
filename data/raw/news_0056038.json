If they are lucky a good Samaritan would give them some money or food. \nRichard Lim, 58, is unable to see with his left eye. He has thick dark hair, tall, looks physically able and speaks good English. \nHe has been a homeless person in Petaling Jaya for 15 years. \nWhile he does odd jobs in the morning; at night he seeks shelter in several areas around in Petaling Jaya. \nWhile areas such as Chow Kit in Kuala Lumpur attracts its fair share of homeless people, some public spaces in Petaling Jaya are home to a number of mostly senior folk \nA check by StarMetro on the homeless in Petaling Jaya revealed that they are made up of elderly Malaysians who are trapped in the urban poverty situation. They can be spotted in areas such as PJ Old Town, Section 14 and SS2. Kechara Soup Kitchen Society has been offering food aid once a week to the needy in Petaling Jaya Old Town since 2008. \nMost of them want a transit home to seek shelter at night and do not want to be placed in a welfare home as they feel it would surely curb their “freedom”. \nUnlike the homeless people in Kuala Lumpur, those in Petaling Jaya do not congregate in groups. They are mostly single and old. \nMost of them are dressed in decent clothing and do not stand out in a crowd. They do odd jobs in nearby markets, restaurants as well as sell recyclable items. Some of them suffer from mental illness. \nAngeline Yong from Carrots Florists and Handicrafts in PJ Old Town said she grew up in the Old Town neighbourhood and has seen her share of homeless folk and urban poor. Yong said many have died over the years. \n“Some of them get drunk, knock their heads somewhere and fall into the drains and are found dead in the morning. We will see the police and the body will be removed. Sometimes Welfare Department officers will come and take the homeless away,” she said, adding that her heart goes out to those who truly require care and assistance. \n“I met an old man in his 80s who sells craft works. He was dropped off here by his son who never returned to pick him up. He claims he rents a space somewhere cheap but we are not sure about that. He showed us a picture of his late wife. A homeless man in PJ Old Town waiting to receive his weekly meal from Kechara Soup Kitchen Society. \n“He would buy craft materials which he would later make decorative items to be sold. We give him free items or a good discount,” she said. \nSection 1B Rukun Tetangga chairman Kok Kuan Yong said it was sad to see some of the homeless who depend on the food handouts distributed by charity groups. \nSome of those lining up for the handouts had been roaming Old Town’s streets for 30 to 40 years. \n“I have lived here all my life, and I grew up together with these people in the same neighbourhood,” said Kok. \nWhile he was aware of their plight, he added that the RT had no resources to help them. \n“Our RT focuses more on issues like neighbourhood safety and cleanliness,” said Kok.

They do not have academic qualifications or skills to secure higher paying jobs,” said Cheah. \nThe group serves food to some 65 registered homeless and urban poor in the area. \n“We help in every possible way. We recommend jobs to some of them, we send them to hospitals for checks and treatments. We also help them to apply for welfare aid.” Tan said the homeless and urban poor do not have families and children. \nCheah said based on the data collected the past 10 years, the biggest percentage of the homeless and urban poor were school dropouts at 83.7%. \nSome 79% come from underprivileged groups. They would have problems with their family or come from poverty- stricken background. \nThere are a number of people who are stranded, either after losing their job, running into problems with debts or addiction, or those released after serving time in prison. Some of them are facing chronic medical issues. \nThere are also a growing number of the homeless who are isolating themselves due to low self-esteem, sexual preferences and coping with the pressure of life, said Cheah. \nKechara volunteer Linda Tan said most of the homeless and urban poor do not have families and children, while some live in abandoned or dilapidated houses and paying very low rent. \nRelated story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:12:05.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
