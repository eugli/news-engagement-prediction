Wochit \n\"Animal Cops Phoenix\" star and animal cruelty investigator Mark Smith wound up adopting Squishy after rescuing her. (Photo: Arizona Humane Society) \n19 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The reality show “Animal Cops Phoenix” can be viewed in a couple of ways. It can be watched as an engaging drama about people who rescue sick, injured and abused animals. Or, you can see it as a great way to learn more about the Arizona Humane Society.\n“There are so many different things people can take away from the show,” says Bretta Nelson, spokesperson for the society. “Everyone can watch the show, and if it leads to awareness for our non-profit organization and more funding and an increase in adoptions? Then we’re really going to be happy.”\n“Animal Cops Phoenix” is a part of a franchise on the Animal Planet network. Just like “NCIS,” there are editions set in different cities, including “Animal Cops Houston” and “Animals Cops Miami.”\nArizona Humane Society in the spotlight The 2017 edition marks Arizona Humane Society’s third time in the spotlight. The organization first was featured on 2006’s “Animal Planet Heroes Phoenix,” an early incarnation of the program, and again in 2009.\n\"Animal Cops Phoenix\" features (from left) Kelley Mallon, Mark Smith, Cynthia McGuire, Andy Gallo and Ruthie Jesus.   (Photo: Alex DeForest) \n“They really look for non-profit organizations that stick out,” Nelson says. “A big part of that for us is the volume and variety of calls we get.”\nShe's not kidding. The organization performs more than 11,000 rescues and investigations a year. And in terms of variety, it’s not merely cats and dogs. This being Arizona, you get to move beyond the typical house pet.\nAZCENTRAL\nThings To Do app: Get the best in events, dining and travel right on your device\n“Someone dumped an injured boa constrictor on a golf course,” says Mark Smith, an animal-cruelty investigator who is featured on the series. “There’s a lot of dogs chained up. There are rescue dogs, and there are abandonment calls. It’s quite a crazy variety.\" \n\nStar: 'It's about bringing awareness' The show began filming last year, as a camera crew accompanied Smith on his calls. He turned out to be a natural on camera.\n“It was a little nerve-wracking at first,” he says. “But on my first call with the crew, I actually forgot they were there. I just got into my mode. I told them later I forgot they were filming me, and they said, ‘That’s the point.’”\nStill, don't go looking for him to hand out roses on \"The Bachelor\" any time soon.\n\"I had fun doing it and the people were great, but it's about bringing awareness,\" he says. \"It is pretty crazy to see yourself doing the job you do every day. It kind of gives you a different perspective on things.\"\nRELATED: Famous Arizona animals | Zoo animals blow up Twitter in #CuteAnimalTweetoff | Adoptable animals in the Valley | Photos: 2017 Doggie Street Festival in Phoenix \nOther series in the franchise show how difficult the job can be. Smith acknowledges that it can emotionally taxing.\n“There’s definitely days and even weeks sometimes where you think about what you’re doing,” he says. “But what you’ve got to do is focus on the good stuff. Working here, we have so many more good endings than ad endings. Usually, you go home feeling good about yourself.”\nReach the reporter at randy.cordova@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

At 10 months old, Molly has puppy-like tendencies and will need daily walks and a few stuffed toys to burn up her energy. She tuckers out quickly and eventually seeks a cozy place to curl up and nap (preferably on your lap or the couch). Molly is well-rounded and good with kids, cats and other dogs.

In a desperate attempt to escape, the orange tabby effortlessly shimmied up a nearby Eucalyptus tree. After several minutes, the dog gave up on barking and left the scene. It was then that Nala realized she was stranded without a way to get down. A few days passed before a concerned Good Samaritan reported the helpless feline and moments later, a crowd gathered to watch as animal rescuers from the Arizona Humane Society climbed a ladder into the branches of the tree. Pleased to see that help had arrived, Nala started meowing and purring in their arms as rescuers brought her down to safety. The hungry and dehydrated cat has now recovered from the incident, but needs a home without dogs. However, the curious and playful two-year-old is great with kids and will sleep beside you at night. When she isn’t perched on the top level of a cat condo, she likes bird watching from the window, or soaking up attention from adoring owners. Her adoption fee is $40 and includes her spay surgery and vaccinations. She is available for adoption at 1521 W. Dobbins Road, Phoenix.

She’s a well-mannered, house-trained, leash-trained, crate-trained and knows several tricks. With her enormous ears, she’s a fantastic listener whether she obeying commands or listening for intruders that lurk outdoors. If you give her a few stuffed toys, she will carry them around the house and pile them up on her dog bed before she sleeps at night. When Nina isn’t sunbathing in the yard, she likes to spend her time lounging around, soaking up belly rubs and shadowing family members the house.

Alex DeForest Fullscreen Daphne | Eight-year-old Daphne has lived a hard life. The Arizona Human Society's medical team was horrified when they found the conditions she was living in. The boxer was severely emancipated, weighing only 29 lbs. She spent years confined to a crate, forced to lie in her own feces where she developed a horrible skin infection. When she was rescued, things started looking up and Daphne soon became a happy, loving and gentle dog. enjoyed belly rubs, good meals and quickly adapted to the family-lifestyle. She flourished in the home environment and enjoyed time spent sunbathing in the yard on her dog bed, going for car rides, and even took a trip to the park for the first time. After reaching a healthy weight and gaining 16 pounds, Daphne’s future was looking bright. Things took an unexpected turn when the medical team discovered a small mass while polishing Daphne’s teeth and the test results came back positive a malignant cancer in the gums. She's a resilient dog who has overcome so much, but now faces uncertainty and limited time to enjoy the things she missed out on over the last eight years. At this time, Daphne’s quality of life is considerably good. She eats well, loves her walks and enjoys meeting new friends. Daphne is looking for a family who will keep Daphne comfortable for as long as she has left, and if her cancer worsens, they’ll be able to make the best decision for her. Though taking Daphne home could be emotionally difficult as her new owner, volunteers said the reward in providing her with unconditional love for her last days in life will likely be very gratifying.

Visit him at 11129 Michigan Avenue, Youngtown.  Sun Cities 4 Paws Fullscreen Socks | When you first meet Socks, she starts purring right away and her motor is so loud that you’d think a tanker truck had just pulled up. This petite seven-pound cat is one of the most outgoing and affectionate felines at the Arizona Humane Society but was given up when her owner passed away. The Russian Blue is sixteen, yet she still displays kitten-like tendencies and will bat at a string, chase a ball or intensely stare as you knit or sew.

Arizona Humane Society Fullscreen Westin | The house was silent as Westin waited in the front window for his owner to return. Days had gone by and not only was the cat lonely, but his food supply was depleted and his water bowl was dry. Then, one hot day in August, help arrived. Westin perked his ears and watched as two animal rescuers from the Arizona Humane Society walked to the door. Many cats would’ve been frightened to have strangers enter the house, but not Westin. The friendly and social feline was happy to have visitors and greeted his new friends with chirps and affectionate head bonks. Since then, Westin has been waiting for a home and has been overlooked. He has a striking appearance with piercing gold eyes and a slender frame that resembles a sleek panther. While this 1-year-old cat looks like the king of the jungle, he is, at heart, a sweet pussycat and loves kids, mellow dogs and other cats. Adopt Westin on Sunday at noon at the Campus for Compassion located at 1521 W. Dobbins Road in Phoenix. His adoption fee is only $20 and includes his neuter surgery and vaccinations. For more information call 602.997.7585 and ask for animal number A540726.  Alex DeForest Fullscreen Merlin | This Maltese mix ended up lost on the streets searching for his family.

This whimsical 2-year-old has a twinkle in his eye and is magical in every way. Not only can this spellbinding canine make you fall in love with his adorable, spunky and animated personality, but he also has the ability to make a treat vanish right before your eyes.

For more information call 602.997.7585 and ask for animal number A547398.  Arizona Humane Society Fullscreen Isabella | With their trademark round faces, stocky bodies, and sumptuous coats, Persians are one of the most recognized cat breeds in the world. Isabella is elegant and docile and has a charmingly sweet nature. Isabella is inherently lazy and relishes every moment of her beauty sleep. Calm and quiet, you may not even notice she’s there if it wasn’t for all that fur. With kitty manners always intact, this 2-year-old is the ultimate lap cat companion and perfect buddy for chilly afternoons spent reading a book. Daily grooming is necessary to keep Isabella looking regal and tangle-free. She tends to be a bit shy and this breed doesn’t do well with loud noises or disruption so Isabella may not be the ideal pet for a home with young children visitors.

Her adoption fee is $200 and includes her spay surgery, grooming and vaccinations.  Arizona Humane Society Fullscreen Tiger | This guy is a beautiful three year old tabby with pale green eyes. Tiger has a silky-soft coat, which he loves to have stroked and brushed. Tiger was given up with another cat, who has found a home. He has been at Sun Cities 4 Paws since July and it is way past time for someone to take a chance on this sweet boy. Because he is on the shy side and doesn’t do a “selling” job, he has been overlooked; some lucky person has yet to claim him as their own. He gets along with small dogs and other cats, and he would love a quiet home with a patient owner who would give him a chance to show his stuff. Visit him at 11129 Michigan Avenue. Call 623-876-8778 after 10 a.m.  Sun Cities 4 Paws Fullscreen Pongo | One-year-old Pongo is a beauty, black and white with a touch of black markings on his otherwise pink nose. He is another one of so many that are just too much for their owners to care for. He’s friendly, just loves to be brushed and petted, is good with the other cats he is now living with and plays with a dangling toy with lots of enthusiasm. Once he catches his “prey,” he hangs on for dear life. Visit Pongo at the Sun Cities 4 Paws shelter, 10807 N. 96th Avenue, Peoria.  Sun Cities 4 Paws Fullscreen Teddy Bear | When Teddy Bear arrived on the doorstep of the Arizona Humane Society, it was clear that the extremely thin, dehydrated and tick infested dog had been on his own for a while. He was so weak and had lost so much blood that he could only stand a few moments before collapsing. After veterinarians stabilized him, Teddy was given a good meal along with a cushy dog bed and the exhausted dog slept straight through the next three days. Though he’s healthy, he still has stray-like tendencies, eating every meal like it’s his last and never turning down a treat. He enjoys walks and is housetrained but he need a home with a yard and young kids make him nervous. Though he’s kind to everyone, Teddy is the type of dog who forms deep bonds with few people and he’s fiercely loyal and gives great kisses with his purple tongue. Meet Teddy Bear on Sunday at noon at the Arizona Humane Society’s Campus for Compassion located at 1521 W. Dobbins Road in Phoenix. His adoption fee $50 is and includes his neuter surgery, medical treatment and vaccinations. For more information call 602.997.7585 and ask for animal number A540890.  Alex DeForest Fullscreen Charlie | Charlie has a lot to be thankful for this holiday season. Found sick, injured and quivering with fright under the freeway bridge near Greenway road, this little 5-month-old kitten wouldn’t have survived on his own had animal rescuers not saved him. After a month of healing in the Second Chance Animal Trauma Hospital, Charlie is now in need of a forever friend. He will purr at the drop of a hat and snuggles with any warm body including kids, other cats and even dogs. Charlie also has a playful side and can’t resist swatting at a feather toy or batting at a ball as it rolls by. Meet Charlie today at the Arizona Humane Society’s Campus for Compassion located at 1521 W. Dobbins Road in Phoenix. His adoption fee $75 is and includes his neuter surgery, medical treatment and vaccinations. For more information call 602.997.7585 and ask for animal number A544046.  Arizona Humane Society Fullscreen Henry | If you are looking for a buddy to enjoy the nice weather outside, consider this German Shepherd, Henry. Though he may have a little gray in his muzzle, this leash trained 8-year-old loves walks, moderate hikes and casual strolls through the park. Afterwards, he will curl up on his dog bed with his favorite stuffed toy and take it easy for the rest of the afternoon. Since he’s past his rowdy puppy days, you can rest assured that your furniture will remain intact and that your shoes won’t be chewed. Another benefit is that Henry is housetrained and has a firm grip on all the basic commands. The former stray wandered away from home, went weeks without a good meal, and was finally rescued and brought to the Arizona Humane Society. He’s pure sweetness and all he needs is a home and an occasional belly rub. Meet Henry at the Campus for Compassion located at 1521 W. Dobbins Road in Phoenix. His adoption fee is $120 and includes his neuter surgery and vaccinations. For more information call 602.997.7585 and ask for animal number A544603.  Arizona Humane Society Fullscreen Chloe | Beautiful gray and white Chloe had to be given up when her owner moved out of state and could not take her. She is 2 and a half years old, with lovely green eyes. Chloe is ok with kids, but does not care for other cats or dogs; she is a people person! Playful and happy to be picked up, especially for a good brushing of her nice, thick coat, she is a sweet cat. She is living at Sun Cities 4 Paws Rescue until she finds a new forever home and welcomes you to 11129 Michigan Avenue, Youngtown. Call 623-876-8778 after 10 a.m.  Sun Cities 4 Paws Rescue Fullscreen Reilly | Reilly is not only a beautiful cat, he is one who truly loves to nestle into a warm lap. Reilly and three others were abandoned at the front door of the Sun Cities 4 Paws Rescue shelter with no information given. He is about one year old, a young boy with a lush brown tiger striped coat and lots of snow white accents. He gets along well with all of the other cats; because he is on the quiet, calm side, he would probably do best in a home without small children. Do pay him a visit at 10807 N. 96th Avenue, Peoria. Adoptions are Tuesdays-Saturdays, 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Call 623-773-2246 after 10 a.m. Other wonderful feline pets are at 11129 Michigan Avenue, Youngtown; call 623-876-8778 after 10 a.m.  Sun Cities 4 Paws Rescue Fullscreen Coco | Coco has experienced his fair share of heartbreaks in his eight years of life. The Clumber Spaniel has been in and out of the shelter through no fault of his own — first his owner's kids were tormenting him, then his new owner fell ill and most recently the family gave him up because they didn’t have time for a dog. With his sleepy-eyed appearance, you’d assume that Coco is a couch potato, but that simply isn’t true. This spry boy has stamina and needs a good walk every day. If he’s bored or left alone for too long, he’s likely to bark, but daily exercise helps him unwind and puts him at ease. Coco is as calm as a clam when you are nearby and he will quietly sit beside you while you brush his feathery and soft fur coat. He’s house-trained, leash-trained and will do just about any trick in exchange for a peanut butter flavored treat. Coco would prefer to be your only canine roommate. Meet or adopt Coco for at Arizona Humane Society’s Sunnyslope Campus located at 9226 N. 13th Avenue in Phoenix. His adoption fee is $200 and includes his neuter surgery and vaccinations. For more information call 602-997-7585 and ask for animal number A547000.  Arizona Humane Society Fullscreen Like this topic?
