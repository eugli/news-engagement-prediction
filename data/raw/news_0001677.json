For the deceased however, I am extremely happy because he died in a mosque, praying (in ruku’u), fasting on a Monday and was killed by your bomb. \n“Given a choice, I would not mind the same type of death. \n“His death was very painful but I want to assure you that you cannot stop us from going to the mosque to pray, neither can you stop us from seeking for and obtaining knowledge and education (both Islamic and western). \n“We have no doubt lost a brother, father, grandfather, Professor, gentleman, pillar of support, guardian and a good man but we have gained a martyr. \n“We are very proud of what Prof. Aliyu Usman Mani achieved in life and in death. We are certain he died in one of the best possible ways to exit this world and that his hereafter is even better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:23:05.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
