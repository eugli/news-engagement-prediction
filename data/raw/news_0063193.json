Senator reacts ABS-CBN News Posted at Feb 24 2017 11:34 AM | Updated as of Feb 24 2017 01:06 PM \nShare Facebook Senator Leila De Lima and Senator Antonio Trillanes \nMANILA - Senator Antonio Trillanes is unfazed by the arrest of colleague Leila De Lima, amid reports that he may prosecuted next. \nTrillanes said the arrest of De Lima, who was slapped with several charges over her supposed ties to illegal drug operations, was to \"send a chilling message\" to critics of President Rodrigo Duterte. READ: De Lima arrested \n\"The primary objective of the illegal arrest of Sen. De Lima is to send a chilling message to the political opposition and critics that they could be next. Well, the effect to me is exactly the opposite,\" Trillanes said Friday. \n\"I am now motivated more than ever to expose him for being a plunderer and mass murderer that he truly is,\" added Trillanes. \nTrillanes had accused Duterte of corruption, claiming that the chief executive had P2 billion in undeclared funds in his bank accounts. Duterte said he will resign if Trillanes proved his claims. \nTrillanes also sought a Senate inquiry into alleged vigilante group, the Davao Death Squad (DDS), which was supposedly behind killings in Davao City while Duterte was still a mayor.
