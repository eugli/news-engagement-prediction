Howe Institute in 2014 that makes the case for eliminating boutique tax credits like those for public transit and volunteer firefighters, while acknowledging the political cost of doing so. \nMilligan also argued that since the age amount and the pension income amount are non-refundable, they cut out many seniors who could use the additional financial support. He suggested it would be better to move their value into the Guaranteed Income Supplement and Old Age Security. \nJennifer Robson, an assistant professor of political management at Carleton University who is also on the review panel, wrote a piece for Canada 2020 in 2015 that highlights the public transit tax credit and the Canada employment credit as particularly regressive. \nRobson, who made it clear she was not speaking specifically about the work of the review panel, said it is about more than setting and meeting a savings target. \n“I think that there is value in thinking of this work of looking at tax expenditures and credits from the perspective of simplicity and reducing burdens of compliance on individual taxpayers as well as businesses,” she said. \nThe Macdonald-Laurier Institute published a paper last week that sets out a checklist for deciding which ones should stay, change, or go. \nIts author, Sean Speer, concluded the government should keep the charitable donations tax credit and the exemption from paying capital gains tax on a primary residence. \nHe said the government should make the disability tax credit refundable and also start taxing health and dental benefits provided by employers, while using that extra revenue to give a refundable tax credit to those who have to buy insurance on their own. \nMeanwhile, Speer argued, the age credit and the public transit tax credit should be eliminated. \nLike Albas, Speer pointed out the fiscal situation has changed quite a bit since the Liberal campaign promise, but he came to the opposite conclusion about how the government might react. \n“If it’s not going to push you into a surplus leading up to an election, I’m not sure it’s the type of thing you would want to spend a lot of political capital on,” said Speer, who was economic adviser to former prime minister Stephen Harper. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:13:23.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
