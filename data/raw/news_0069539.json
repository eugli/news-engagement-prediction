The only thing standing in the way of more home sales is the lack of homes for sale. In local markets across the nation, there are too few listings to meet the strong buyer demand. That means more competition and drives higher prices. More homes usually come on to the market ahead of the spring season, but so far that is not the case.\n\"We are not hearing of any spike in seller movement,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. \"We are just hearing of normal conditions — some sellers who need to move, so they're putting their homes on the market, but nothing drastic.\"\nSupplies were depleted even more by an unexpected rush of home buyers in November and December, following the presidential election. Some are calling it the Trump rally in housing, but it may be the mixed result of consumer confidence and smart shopping.\n\"It's likely that a combination of tight inventory and low mortgage interest rates is pushing some buyers into the market early this year, both to capitalize on low mortgage interest rates while they can and to get a jump on the competition to come in the busy spring home shopping season,\" said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow .\nAs home prices rise, fewer homes are affordable to fewer potential buyers, and that is only getting worse. Listings are now down more than 7 percent versus a year ago nationally, but as with everything in real estate, location matters.\nThese markets are particularly lean on listings:\nActive listings compared to a year ago\nChicago : -13%\nPhiladelphia : -14%\nWashington : -15%\nSeattle : -17%\nMinneapolis: -18%\nSt. Louis : -12%\nBaltimore: -16%\nCleveland : -18%\nOrlando : -19%\nThese markets have more listings this year:\nActive listings compared to a year ago\nLos Angeles : flat\nDallas : flat\nHouston : +6%\nSan Francisco : +4%\nPittsburgh: +9%\nDenver : +3%\nLas Vegas : +18%\nSan Antonio: +6%\nMiami : +3%\nSource: Realtor.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:03:39.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
