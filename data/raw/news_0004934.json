Palbociclib works on advanced forms of the most common type of breast cancer, the HER2 negative type. Experts estimate 5,500 women in England would be eligible if it were approved. Trials have shown taking palbociclib alongside a common drug called an aromatase inhibitor stops aggressive cancers progressing by just over two years - 10 months longer than the standard treatment. Some women had much better results, they found. Dr Nicholas Turner, of London's Institute of Cancer Research, who led the clinical trials, said: 'Palbociclib is one of the most important advances in treating the most common type of breast cancer in 20 years. 'It is very disappointing that palbociclib is not being made available to patients, but cost is the limiting factor. But officials will only view the life-changing breast cancer drug palbociclib as cost-effective if its price is cut by 80 per cent, taking it from £2,950 a month to less than £590. 'If the manufacturer, NICE and NHS England can find a way of making this treatment available for patients, they will substantially improve the lives of patients with breast cancer.' Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of the Breast Cancer Now charity, said: 'This is the clearest illustration to date that the drug appraisal system is totally unfit-for-purpose in assessing first-in-class breast cancer medicines. 'For women with incurable breast cancer in England to potentially be made to wait years for such a promising drug – while NHS bodies and pharmaceutical companies haggle over pricing – would be totally unacceptable. 'Palbociclib could benefit a large proportion of metastatic breast cancer patients and may even be the closest thing these women would have to a cure in their lifetime. 'Pfizer must urgently reconsider their decision not to offer the NHS any form of discount on the list price. 'But the decision also makes plain the systemic flaws of the NICE appraisal process.' Professor Carole Longson, director of the centre for health technology assessment at NICE, accepted the drug can make a big difference to patients. But she added: 'Even when allowing for these potential benefits, it was still not enough to make palbociclib cost effective at its current price. 'The committee heard from the patient expert that delaying the progression of their cancer for as long as possible and being able to continue with normal activities, including working, is valued very highly by patients and their families. 'It also heard that by postponing disease progression, palbociclib may reduce the number of people who are exposed to the often unpleasant side effects of chemotherapy, and delay the need for such treatment in others. 'Taking the costs into account, the committee concluded that it could not recommend palbociclib for NHS use at present.' David Crosby, of the Breast Cancer Care charity, added: 'It is devastating access to palbociclib is being blocked. 'The drug will allow women to live well with the disease, to be there with loved ones for the moments that matter. This time is irreplaceable. 'Urgent conversations must happen so we do not sentence people to second-rate care.'
