What are you going to do about #Antsemitism in @WhiteHouse pic.twitter.com/95Z5GP1OBc — AnneFrankCenter(US) (@AnneFrankCenter) February 21, 2017 \nSteven Goldstein, executive director of the center, said that Trump’s statement on anti-Semitism did not reflect actions from the White House. \n“Make no mistake: The anti-Semitism coming out of this administration is the worst we have ever seen from any administration,” he said. \nGoldstein also reiterated criticism directed at Trump last month when he failed to mention Jews in his speech marking Holocaust Memorial Day. \n“When President Trump responds to Anti-Semitism proactively and in real time, and without pleas and pressure, that’s when we will be able to say this president has turned a corner. This is not that moment,” the statement concluded. \nThe Anne Frank Center is trending on Twitter as people offer mixed reaction to the organization’s statement. This statement from the Anne Frank Center is the most well-worded statement I've heard all year!

Goldstein responded to the president’s executive orders on immigration last month, describing his actions as “ demonizing refugees and immigrants.” \nTrump “is driving our nation off a moral cliff,” he said. \nREAD MORE: At least 7 Jewish centers receive bomb threats, could be 'same serial caller' \nOn Monday, Jewish community centers in at least six US states received bomb threats in what was reportedly the fourth wave of such threats this year. \nPaul Goldenberg, director of the Secure Community Network, said the caller involved in each of the incidents appeared to be the same person. \nThe centers were evacuated for a period. No bombs were found on any of the premises. \nIn a separate incident Tuesday, more than 100 headstones were vandalized at a Jewish cemetery in St Louis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:49:27.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
