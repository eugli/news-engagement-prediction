Toronto is holding onto the final wild card spot in the Eastern Conference, currently with 61 points in 53 games (25-18-11).\nMitch Marner scored in defeat and Frederik Andersen yielded three goals on 23 shots while being denied his 100th career win.\nSam Reinhart also found the back of the net for Buffalo, now up to 56 points (23-22-10). Robin Lehner was terrific with 43 saves in victory.\nThe Leafs were coming off a 2-1 overtime loss to St. Louis on Thursday, one that saw them start slowly — outshot 17-4 after the first period. Saturday offered more of the same as the Sabres pounced all over their rivals early.\nBuffalo hit a crossbar less than two minutes in and then scored a few minutes after that, the first of two on the night for Kane on a quick play off an offensive zone draw for the Sabres. Eichel beat fellow American centre Auston Matthews for the faceoff before Reinhart shuffled the loose puck over to Kane, who beat Andersen clean.\n\n© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:29:20.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
