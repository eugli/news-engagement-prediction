Saeed's inclusion in the list shows he is linked with militancy in some way. Saeed was earlier this month put on the Exit Control List, barring him from leaving the country. \nSaeed was also put under house arrest after the Mumbai attacks in November 2008, but he was freed by a court in 2009. \nHafiz Saeed's brother says Pakistan put JuD chief under house arrest due to Indian pressure \nHe carries a reward of USD 10 million announced by the US for his role in terror activities. \nDuring a panel discussion on countering extremism and terrorism, Asif had said: \"Terrorism is not synonymous to any religion. Terrorists aren't Christians or Muslims or Buddhists or Hindus. They are terrorists, they are criminals.\" First Published: Tuesday, February 21, 2017 - 13:01 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:57:30.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
