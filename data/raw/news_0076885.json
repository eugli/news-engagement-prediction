Indian astrologer predicts dire outcome for Australia in four-Test series despite initial success February 28, 2017 6:09pm by Staff writers Source: FOX SPORTS YOU know India are getting desperate when one of their leading newspapers have turned to an astrologer — yep, that’s right, an astrologer — to critique the likelihood of Australia prevailing in the four-Test contest. \nDespite leading 1-0 in the series, the news isn’t good for Steve Smith’s men. \nIndian newspaper The Daily News and Analysis hired astrologer Greenstone Lobo to analyse the Australian players ahead of the second Test starting in Bangalore on Saturday. \nLobo started out fairly positively, saying: “Australia are a strong team astrologically. One can expect some more batsmen and pacer Jackson Bird, besides spinners Nathan Lyon and Steve O’Keefe, to excel in the three Tests ahead.” \nBut that was as far as the good news went for Smith and his troops. \n“But despite all the heroics, Australia cannot win this Test series in India,” Lobo wrote. Boof: Lyon was unlucky 0:43 \n“Astrologically, Smith is never going to be a great captain, and he definitely cannot do what even (Steve) Waugh couldn’t. It would probably have been a different equation if David Warner was leading this side. \n“Interestingly, India head coach Anil Kumble and his Australian counterpart Darren Lehmann were born in the same year and share similar planetary positions,” Lobo added. “While Lehmann has achieved all that he was destined as coach, Kumble still has more to come, which only adds to India’s chances of winning the series. \n“Virat Kohli’s horoscope is better than Smith’s and will come up the final winner,” Lobo said. \n“Expect a rejigged Indian batting line-up to fire on all cylinders and the bowling unit to rediscover its mojo from the second Test. India will bounce back dramatically and win the series.” \n*** Steve Smith celebrates his brilliant century in Pune. Source: AP \nFORGET planetary alignments, a big talking point since India’s humiliating 333-run loss has been claims that the team’s senior management hijacked the preparation of the Pune pitch. \nPune’s Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) Stadium made its debut as a Test venue but the state of the pitch was widely slammed, with Shane Warne saying it looked like an “eighth day wicket”. \nThe Hindustan Times reported that there was a lot of resistance to producing a raging turner of a pitch. \n“When the MCA refused to prepare a rank turner, a senior member of the team management took the issue to the state association curator Pandurang Salgaonkar. When he too resisted, the matter was placed before the BCCI curators (Daljit Singh and Dhiraj Parsana; senior members of the BCCI pitches committee), but even they were a tad reluctant,” an unnamed MCA member was quoted as saying by Indian Express in a report published on Monday. \n“Then, the BCCI management (not the Committee of Administrators, the cricket board employees) came into the picture. The ground staff had been ordered to remove the grass completely. Things were hijacked from the local curators,” the official went on to say. 'Steve's good for Australia' 1:56 \n*** \nIT looks like better news for the pitch in the second Test. Whereas Pune looked like a parched desert, the ground staff at stadium in Bangalore aren’t being miserly with water. \nThat’s according to the Indian Express , who says we’re unlikely to see a sandpit develop like in Pune. \n“You head to the stadium to see a surprising sight: water sprinkling here and there. Where Pune looked a parched desert, the ground staff at stadium in Bangalore aren’t being miserly with water. Not yet. The word is that the pitch would be a slow turner — something that would help spin from second or third day but it won’t be a sand pit. A usual Bangalore track, in other words.” \n*** \nBUT the state of the pitch is causing headaches among former players, notably India spin legend Erapalli Prasanna, who told The Hindustan Times that: “If I was the curator, I would prepare a good wicket, which will turn from fourth and fifth day.” 'He bowled to his strengths' 1:22 \n“For Bangalore, we are caught between the devil and the deep sea,” Prasanna declared on Monday, observing that the Indian team management will be in a dilemma over the wicket for the second Test after their ploy to go for a rank turner in the first game spectacularly backfired. \n“I don’t expect a turner at Bangalore,” the former off-spinner predicted ahead of the match to be staged in his hometown from Saturday. \n*** \nFURTHER confusing matters about the expected state of the Banglaore pitch is that it has in the past provided plenty of initial assistance to fast bowlers before becoming a batsman’s dream. \nwwww.mid-day.com recounted how the local state team have almost always bowled first. \n“To make it more intriguing, this is one venue where teams winning the toss have chosen to bowl first, something which is almost unheard of in India, The local state team, Karnataka, with a good crop of pacers in their midst, have almost always bowled first for the pitch is known to have something in it for the bowlers on day one and thereafter it becomes a batsman’s dream. Even Virat Kohli invited the South Africans to bat first in the last Test played here in November 2015 but then it wasn’t his pacers but spin twins R Ashwin and R Jadeja who bagged four each, to bowl out the visitors for 214 on Day One.” Monty heaps praise on O'Keefe 4:59", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:19:36.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
