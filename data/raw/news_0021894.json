You can’t park there until 10 o’clock. You violated city ordinances,” he said, barely hiding a giggle. \n“I literally pulled up at 9.58,” Sarah told the court, adding that the car clock said 10 a.m. \nJudge Caprio jokingly lambasted her: “So now you’re blaming the car clock?” \nHe then asked the court inspector, “What does justice demand in this case, is this jail?” \n“10 o’clock means 10 o’clock, judge,” the inspector replied. \nCaprio decided that the on-duty meter maid may have been a bit too nitpicky and dismissed the case.
