I couldn’t really tell what he looked like … he couldn’t move his legs.”\nGannon said she called around to hospitals hoping to find out about Flaro’s status and never got an answer.\nBut recently his name popped up in a buy-sell group on Facebook, so she sent him a message.\nFlaro said he got goosebumps when he received the note. He too had tried to track Gannon down.\n“I wanted to find her back then because she saved my life,” Flaro added.\nThe reunion was held at a hotel in Cornwall. It turns out the two live just 10-minutes apart.\nWith a report from CTV Ottawa’s Megan Shaw \nPhotos Tony Flaro is reunited with Adele Gannon, in Cornwall, Ont., in Feb. 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:27:43.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
