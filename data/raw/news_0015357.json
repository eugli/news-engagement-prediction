Birmingham maintains that federal schools funding will still increase from $16bn in 2016 to around $20.1bn in 2020. \nOn Sunday Fairfax Media reported that several schools funding proposals have been discussed in detail during cabinet meetings, although the federal government does not have a final position. \nReports suggest that “overfunded” private schools – those already above the schools resourcing standard – will see growth in their funding shrink to help other schools, although Plibersek has said any savings would be dwarfed by cuts . \n“After failing to provide details for more than three years, many parents, teachers and principals are growing anxious about what your government’s intentions are,” she wrote. \nSpeaking with ABC News24, Plibersek said that schools “don’t know whether they can be employing teachers, or extend the extra teachers they’ve put on because of needs-based funding”. \nPlibersek called for the government to release the level of funding for each state and school system, and each individual school. \n“Labor is particularly worried about the impact of your government’s cuts on disadvantaged schools,” she wrote. \nPlibersek offered to work constructively with the government but said that was only possible with the release of a “detailed and cleared plan”. \nBirmingham told Guardian Australia there was “no reason schools won’t be able to continue to support teachers and new or existing initiatives, such as specialist teachers or targeted intervention programs” because funding was still growing. \nHe said 27 “cosy deals” negotiated by the former Labor government had resulted in perverse outcomes like “a disadvantaged student in a school in one state [receiving] up to $1,500 less federal funding per year than the exact same student would receive in other states in the exact same circumstances”. \nOn Friday Birmingham cited new figures in the Productivity Commission review of government services report that in the last five years, six out of the eight states and territories were spending less on schools. \n“And yet they have the gall to come out and call for even more federal funding whilst their commitment and investment is in fact going backwards.” \nBirmingham said the Turnbull government will provide “growth above inflation, above enrolments” and make sure it is conditional on states and territories maintaining their real level of investment and quality reforms.
