The Government has a clear strategy and we believe this is the right approach.”\nMs Rudd also attributed the closure to a lack of local funding, a claim furiously countered by several councils who said they had written to the Home Secretary to urge approval of more child asylum seekers. \nA High Court challenge to the scheme’s closure has been scheduled for early May.\nThe legal challenge, which is being brought by the charity Help Refugees, claims the consultation process with local authorities that led to the scheme's closure was “fundamentally flawed”.\nA Home Office spokesperson told T he Independent over 900 unaccompanied children had been transferred to the UK from Europe in 2016, including more than 750 from France as part of the UK’s support for the Calais camp clearance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:00:36.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
