Gary Barlow has revealed he has washed his hair for the first time in 14 years \n\"Thankfully my hair didn’t smell – I used lavender essential oil which is supposed to be antibacterial and got rid of any odours. \n\"I tried everything, so many different ingredients to try and scrub the gunk out, including oatmeal and rye flour, but as soon as I started using clay about seven weeks in, everything fell into place. \n\"It was the sort they use in spas, mixed with apple cider vinegar as it is very cleansing, to make a paste a bit like yoghurt. \n\"You massage it into your hair and scalp like shampoo and then rinse it. Kayleigh and her 'no shampoo' hair \n\"When I first decided to stop using shampoo and conditioner in March 2015 it was after I’d seen a blog about “no poo”. \n\"It looked completely normal and the blogger said it was more environmentally friendly with no chemicals. \n\"So if she could do it and look like a normal human being, I would give it a try and see if it really worked – why not? \n\"A lot of it is about finding the right ingredients that work for your hair. After a while the clay made it quite dry so now I use a combination of different Indian herbs which I mix together. \n\"Previously I suffered from rashes behind my ears and my hair would be greasy in just a day. Now it lasts four or five days. It means it needs washing much less so it is worth putting the effort in. \n\"My husband Graeme thought I was a little bit crazy at first. He is very supportive though and now he is great about it. \n\"Even on my wedding day there was no shampoo – I used hairspray just to set it all but that is about the most toxic thing I have used on my hair in the last two years. Kayleigh with husband Graeme \n\"My hair is actually the healthiest it has ever been. It’s shinier, seems to grow faster and has a lot more volume. It doesn’t have that silky feeling that you get when you use conditioner, but it’s really soft. \n\"I love how it feels and most days I don’t do anything with it. It’s now so easy to manage that I just get up, brush my hair and go. \n\"Even the hairdresser now uses my mixture to wash my hair and most people are cool about it and realise it isn’t as weird as it sounds. \n\"This whole experience has taught me to love my hair in its natural state. \n\"It is nice knowing you can use just one or two natural ingredients and it is just as effective. \n\"If I had kids I probably wouldn’t bother using shampoo on them either. I knew someone whose baby boy had cradle cap scaly patches and he said he didn’t use shampoo on his head for about two months and his scalp turned out fine. \nWatch: How to wash your hands PROPERLY... an 11-step guide...
