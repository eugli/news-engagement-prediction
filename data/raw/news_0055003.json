Fernando Bryant (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 1:34 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 1:34 p.m. ET \nFernando Bryant, who played 10 seasons in the NFL as a cornerback and won a Super Bowl ring with the Pittsburgh Steelers, said he was fired this week from his job as a high school football coach because of past social media posts. \nAccording to Atlanta TV station WXIA , Bryant had been the head football coach at Strong Rock Christian School in Locust Grove, Ga., for only 20 days when he received a letter informing him he had been terminated. The letter cited in part, Bryant's \"family’s public presence on social media and the internet and questioned whether the postings and information were consistent with our Christian values.\" \nMORE: NFL free agency 2017: Top free agents, best players by position, key dates \nBryant said the school did not provide specific posts that led to his termination. But a source at the school sent WXIA a screenshot of a three-year-old Instagram post showing Bryant and his wife, Amber, holding a bottle of alcohol at an event. Amber Bryant is a TV personality on the Bravo show, \"Mother Funders,\" which follows a PTO at a local elementary school. \n\"I was led to believe it was my wife’s [post]. They never showed it to me or never said anything other than a parent brought it to their attention,\" Bryant told WXIA. \nThe school did not respond to a request for more information from the station. \nBryant told the station he is considering legal action, but he's particularly upset about how one parent could apparently influence the school's decision. \n\"If one parent or one part of a school can control it that much as far as Christianity, it makes you wonder what times we’re in,\" he said. \"I am a Christian, that’s the one thing that gives Christianity a bad name, when we start passing judgment on each other.\" \nThe Jaguars selected the former Alabama player 26th overall in the 1999 NFL Draft. He went on to play with the Lions and Patriots before finishing his career in 2008 with Pittsburgh as a member of the Super Bowl XLIII championship team.
