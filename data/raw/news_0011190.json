The assailant and his companion, who were both wearing masks, fled on board a white Honda XRM motorcycle, police said. ADVERTISEMENT \nBased on the empty shells recovered from the crime scene, police said the weapon used on Tesiorna was a 9mm pistol. \nA passenger motorcycle brought Tesiorna to the Miranda Family Hospital, where doctors said he needed blood transfusion. He was later airlifted to Cebu City for treatment. \nTesiorna’s shooting came four days after retired Regional Trial Court judge Victor Canoy was shot to death by a lone gunman last Thursday while he was buying food at an eatery near his law office along Borja Street. Police still have no lead on Canoy’s shooting. \nSenior Supt. Anthony Maghari, police chief for Surigao del Norte, said Tesiorna sought and was granted police protection last week after Canoy was killed. \nA policeman assigned to the prosecutor was already en route to the victim’s residence when the shooting happened, Maghari said. \nPolice have been reviewing CCTV footages and interviewing witnesses to identify the assailants, Maghari said. \nHe said it was unlikely that one group was involved in the Canoy and Tesiorna’s shooting although he declined to elaborate, citing ongoing investigation.
