How is that even possible? \nBut even the most youthful looking of mums would be lucky to look the spitting image of their teenage daughter - and Reese looks like her little girl's TWIN. \nThe movie superstar posted a sweet snap of herself with daughter Ava, 17, on Instagram, showing them looking into each other's eyes. https://www.instagram.com/p/BQPji8eAost/?tagged=biglittlelies/embed \nThey are both wearing beautiful dresses and both have their hair up, with incredibly similar poses, ahead of the premiere for Reese's new film Big Little Lies. \nFans quickly rushed to comment on how they look like twins, look like \"mirror images\" of each other - but some were even questioning which one was Reese. \nOne confused Instagram user said: \"I'm convinced they're the same people like wtf\" \nHas it been Photoshopped? Is it really just two photos of Reese? Reese and Ava look strikingly similar (Photo: reesewitherspoon/instagram) \nThat was the theory of one Instagrammer, who said: \"I thought someone had edited this to make it look like you were looking at yourself.\" \nAnother wrote: \"I can't tell which one is Reese.\" \ncsteelejohnson commented: \"Geez! You two look like twin sisters!\" \nTo be fair, it's pretty difficult to tell them apart, but Reese is on the right-hand side of the image, with daughter Ava on the left. \nIt's not the first time people have marvelled at how alike the mum and daughter look. Ava could be Reese Witherspoon's twin \nIn September 2015 when Ava - Reese's daughter with ex Ryan Philippe - turned 16, the star shared a sweet throwback snap along with one of her little girl all grown up. \nFans couldn't believe that the image wasn't just a picture of Reese when she was a bit younger.
