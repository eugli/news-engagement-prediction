I don’t agree with many of those, some of those cases. But the courts have been highly deferential to the president, and they generally don’t second-guess. I think the people also have to acknowledge that the Trump administration here is making virtually the identical argument to the Obama administration.”\n“The Obama administration argued the president’s judgment on administration was largely unreviewable,” he continued. “He argued that he could even refuse or order the failure to enforce immigration laws. But the arguments were very, very similar. And for all the Democrats objecting now, I didn’t hear a peep of objection from them when just last year these arguments were being made by the same Justice Department.”\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor\nRead More Stories About: Breitbart TV , Immigration , Donald Trump , immigration , Jonathan Turley , MSNBC , The 11th Hour", "external_links": ["http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F09%2Fturley-trump-making-arguments-obama-defense-immigration-executive-order%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Turley%3A+Trump+Making+Same+Arguments+as+Obama+in+Defense+of+Immigration+Executive+Order", "http://twitter.com/jeff_poor", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F09%2Fturley-trump-making-arguments-obama-defense-immigration-executive-order%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Turley%3A+Trump+Making+Same+Arguments+as+Obama+in+Defense+of+Immigration+Executive+Order&shortener=bitly", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F09%2Fturley-trump-making-arguments-obama-defense-immigration-executive-order%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Turley%3A+Trump+Making+Same+Arguments+as+Obama+in+Defense+of+Immigration+Executive+Order"], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:25:56.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
