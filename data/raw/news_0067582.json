In Tasmania, women on average earn $173.60 per week less than men. \nMaternity leave and the trend for women to work part-time after babies is often used to justify the gap but Dr Vicki Gardiner, general manager of Engineers Australia Tasmania, said gender bias was insidious and began at a young age. \n\"Only 13 per cent of engineers in Australia are women,\" Dr Gardiner said. \n\"Part of the challenge is getting more women into engineering to start with.\" \nDr Gardiner pointed to a 2017 US psychological study , where a group of children aged five were given pictures of men and women and asked who was more successful. \nThe children chose their own gender - but a few years later when the study was repeated, both boys and girls were more likely to select the men in the photos as more successful. \nDr Gardiner attributed part of the problem to the lack of women in leadership roles in the male-dominated science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields, and said girls tended to avoid workplaces where they felt like an outsider. \nShe explained the male-dominated engineering industry was more inflexible making it difficult for women to return after having a baby. Confidence key to striving higher \nCaring for children has a major impact on all Australian women with a 2015 ANZ report revealing on average, a woman retired with half the superannuation of a man. Despite programs to boost the number of women in the film industry, the key decision makers and award winners are still overwhelmingly male. \nIn Tasmania, the most recent study showed more than 60 per cent of the people with less than $10,000 in superannuation were women, while about the same percentage of people with more than $100,000 of superannuation were men. \nIt is the reason the Tasmanian Government is aiming to have equal representation of men and women on all government boards and committees by 2020. \nThe University of Tasmania (UTAS) and the State Government are also hoping to come up with some creative ideas to reduce the gender pay gap through a free forum on Monday February 27 . \n\"One of the reasons for this forum is to educate students about the issue because the pay gap is evident right from the beginning,\" Dr Megan Alessandrini, founding director of the University of Tasmania Gender Policy and Strategy Group, said. \nIt is hoped the forum will make students more aware of unconscious bias. \nDr Gardiner said she loved speaking to female students with the aim of empowering them to strive high. \n\"When women are looking for a job they look at the list of things they need to do and say, 'Yeah I can do all those, but not that one so I won't go for it'. \n\"Whereas men will say 'I can do three-quarters of them, I'll give it a whirl'. \n\"The big thing is just having that confidence and reminding yourself that you are capable of doing different things.\" \nDr Gardiner will be on the forum panel along with the Tasmanian Minister for Women, Jacquie Petrusma, Labor's Rebecca White and Greens leader Cassy O'Connor.
