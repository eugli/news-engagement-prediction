This conversation left Plaintiff feeling intimidated, embarrassed, and scared, and caused Plaintiff to believe that nothing illegal or tortious was happening.\" \nKlages did not respond to an email, and a home number for her has been disconnected. \nMichigan State, which is leading the police investigation of Nassar, has said the university didn't learn of allegations against Nassar until 2014. At that time, however, no charges were brought, and Nassar was allowed to keep practicing as long as he used gloves and a chaperone for pelvic procedures. \nHe was fired in the fall for allegedly violating those rules after the first two accusers came forward. He had previously been fired as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics, the governing body for the sport, in response to \"athlete concerns.\" Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:39:51.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
