Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don’t know. But they don’t believe you,” Trump charged. \n“But you’ve got to be at least a little bit fair, and that’s why the public sees it. They see it. They see it’s not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.” \nWATCH: President Trump: The leaks are real, the news is fake The survey begins by asking respondents to compare their level of trust for CNN , which Trump has repeatedly labelled a fake news organization, MSNBC and Fox News ; they are then asked to identify the issues that mainstream media outlets do the worst job of covering. Options include immigration, religion and pro-life values. Respondents are then quizzed about a range of other grievances, including whether they believe the mainstream media intentionally creates feuds within the Republican Party , does fact-checking when reporting on the Trump administration, and “uses slurs rather than facts” to attack conservative positions on various issues. \nOnce respondents fill out the poll, they are encouraged to make a donation to “help us fight back against the media’s attacks and deceptions.” \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump blasts ‘fake news’ media, calling Russian connection ‘non-sense’ \nThe survey was emailed to supporters, who were urged to “do your part to fight back against the media’s attacks and deceptions,” according to the Boston Globe , “Over these next four years, our movement will be subjected to some of the nastiest attacks you can imagine. That’s why I’ve made it a point to cut through the media noise and go straight to the American people,” the email read. \n— With files from the Associated Press © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
