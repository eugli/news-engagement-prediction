Image copyright The Hunted One Image caption Ricky Slade thought he was chatting with a girl, 10, but was talking to an adult from the group \nSlade later admitted three counts of attempting to incite a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity and one count of attempting to meet a child under 16 following grooming. \nHe was released on bail, but a warrant was issued for his arrest when he failed to attend court for sentencing on 24 January. \nHe was taken to prison while he awaited his next court appearance. He was 30 years old at the time of his death and of no fixed address. Image copyright The Hunted One 'Trying to help out' \nBen Bleach, a member of The Hunted One, said the group has a 100% conviction rate and has brought 43 people to court so far. \nSpeaking before Slade's death, he said: \"There are a couple of us in the group that know of people that have been abused in our own families. \n\"We do it because we've had experience of how much it does affect people as children and as they grow up.\" \nHe said \"everything is researched\" and members of the group chat to suspects for several weeks or months before arranging meetings. \n\"I find it hard in this day and age why the police can't back groups that are doing it properly, or if not, be willing to give certain training to help groups out, because obviously the police are underfunded by the government so they are stretched as far as they can be,\" he said. \n\"So we don't blame the police for not being able to do it, it's just something we are trying to do to help out and we've got a 100% conviction rate as it stands. So I think we are doing quite a good job.\" \nIn a statement issued in December, Nottinghamshire Police said that \"identifying alleged paedophiles is best left to the police\". \nHowever, Det Insp Peter Quinn said the force would consider evidence given to them \"irrespective of where the evidence came from\". \n\"We understand the desire to protect children but our advice to any member of the public who has information about suspected child sexual abuse - online or otherwise - is to contact police so we can investigate and, where possible, bring people to justice,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:42:14.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
