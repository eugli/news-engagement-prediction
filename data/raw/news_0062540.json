Now the La Liga champs are in need of reinforcements everywhere. \nLast weeks hammering at the hands of PSG told the story of Barcelona's current season. They may still be second in the league but they are clearly a long way from where they used to be. \nLuis Enrique's side struggled massively in the Champions League as the French champions battered them 4-0 in the city of love. \nBarca clearly need reinforcements in midfield but they were worryingly disappointing in defence and their lack of a right-back, despite Sergi Roberto's best efforts, is particularly in need of sorting. \nAnd according to the Evening Standard Tottenham Hotspur's Kyle Walker tops the shortlist of right backs but the Camp Nou side could have to pay upwards of £60 million. \nReportedly last summer Manchester City made a bid of £60 million for Walker and his fellow full-back Danny Rose but Spurs told the former Premier League champions that each player was worth that much. \nBarca though could be willing to splash that cash as Walker would make the ideal replacement for Dani Alves who left for Juventus at the end of last season and is yet to be replaced. \nCheck out what Spurs new stadium will look like: \n(Credit: Spurs ) \nIt might be difficult to prise any player away from White Hart Lane right now with the club flying high and the prospect of a new ground in the 2018/19 season. \nHowever things are so close in the top four that they could easily have no Champions League football next season which would lead to questions over some players' futures. \n£60 million is a lot for a full back! \nWho should Barcelona sign in the summer?
