He's speaking to Vice President Pence relative to the conversation the Vice President had with General Flynn and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is — our national security,\"the White House stated. \nFlynn’s phone communications with Kislyak prior to Trump’s inauguration on January 20 have raised questions about whether the advisor broke a law forbidding private US citizens from engaging with foreign nations about diplomatic disputes. US media reported Flynn had discussed the issue of anti-Russian sanctions with Kislyak before Trump was officially sworn in as US president. \nDETAILS TO FOLLOW", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:24:10.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
