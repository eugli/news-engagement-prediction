Coronation Street viewers left bemused as Leanne Battersby gives birth in a lift… but there’s no sign of the baby’s umbilical cord \nLeanne went into labour while trapped in a lift with sister Toyah By JILL ROBINSON, SHOWBIZ REPORTER 20th February 2017, 9:52 pm CORONATION Street viewers were left baffled on Monday night after Leanne Battersby appeared to give birth to a baby without an umbilical cord. \nThe character – played by Jane Danson – went into labour while trapped in a lift with sister Toyah , but with no sign of the jammed doors being opened any time soon, Leanne gave birth on the floor. ITV 6 Toyah shouted for help but no one could get the doors opened \nToyah scooped the baby up and placed it in her sibling’s arms, before paramedics were finally able to get into the lift to check on the new mum. \nBut fans were quick to ask what had happened to a key stage of the post-labour process. \nOne wrote on Twitter: “Um so who cut the umbilical cord? #coronationstreet”, while another added: “What did she use to cut the umbilical cord?!” \n6 Toyah had to support her sister through her contractions. \nA third was also puzzled, writing: “So who’s cut the cord and has she delivered the placenta?! #corrie”. \nThe two women were trapped as Toyah’s phone didn’t work and Leanne didn’t have hers with her, so they had to rely on Robert Preston, who arrived to get the lift himself, to call for help. ITV 6 Leanne admitted she was scared about giving birth \nLeanne cried: “I’m not having a baby in this lift!” but it soon became apparent there was no other option, as no one could get the lift doors open. \nBut as the contractions grew stronger and more frequent, Leanne leaned on her sister for support, admitting she was “scared”.
