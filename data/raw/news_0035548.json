The leader of the Lebaense militant group, which waged war against Israel inside Lebanon in 2000 and 2006, said the “two-state basis for peace” is “over.”\nTrump announced Wednesday he was not committed to a two-state solution, at the conclusion of a summit with Netanyahu in Washington.\nNasrallah described Trump’s policy as “confused”.\nThe Hezbollah leader also said his group’s strength was the principle deterrent to Israeli aggression in Lebanon and vowed to strike Israel’s Dimona nuclear facilities in the event of war. It was the first time he made the threat explicitly.\n Big Government , National Security , Dimona nuclear facilities , Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Israeli-Palestinian peace process , Middle East diplomacy", "external_links": ["http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fjerusalem%2F2017%2F02%2F17%2Fhezbollahs-leader-says-israeli-palestinian-peace-process-thanks-president-trump%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Hezbollah%E2%80%99s+Leader+Says+the+Israeli-Palestinian+Peace+Process+Is+%E2%80%98Over%E2%80%99+Thanks+to+President+Trump", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fjerusalem%2F2017%2F02%2F17%2Fhezbollahs-leader-says-israeli-palestinian-peace-process-thanks-president-trump%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Hezbollah%E2%80%99s+Leader+Says+the+Israeli-Palestinian+Peace+Process+Is+%E2%80%98Over%E2%80%99+Thanks+to+President+Trump&shortener=bitly", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fjerusalem%2F2017%2F02%2F17%2Fhezbollahs-leader-says-israeli-palestinian-peace-process-thanks-president-trump%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Hezbollah%E2%80%99s+Leader+Says+the+Israeli-Palestinian+Peace+Process+Is+%E2%80%98Over%E2%80%99+Thanks+to+President+Trump"], "published": "2017-02-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T13:11:21.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
