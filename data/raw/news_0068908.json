Provided Walker has worked in downtown restaurants for the last dozen years. He worked for Jeff Ruby for seven years at the Waterfront, Belterra, Carlo & Johnny and the Precinct before moving to Boca downtown. He most recently worked for the Thunderdome Group, where he oversaw Bakersfield and Krueger's Tavern. \"When I was a kid, I used to go into the kitchen and see my dad cooking, and he seemed to love doing it even if he wasn't getting paid for it, so that's what I wanted to do,\" Walker told me. \"As soon as the butter hit the skillet, I was gone.\" As the name implies, Court Street Lobster Bar's menu will center around lobster rolls. There will be three varieties: a traditional Maine-style lobster roll with mayonnaise, a Connecticut-style roll with drawn butter and a Cincinnati-style lobster roll with a Sriracha mayonnaise base. Court Street Lobster Bar will also serve shrimp and crab rolls as well as a chicken salad roll. The menu will include two seasonal salads, two soups and a daily special. Items will range in price from $8 for the chicken salad rolls to $15 to $19 for the lobster rolls. The bar will have a full liquor license and eight taps pouring four local beers and four New England craft beers. It'll also have beer in cans and bottles, a cocktail menu and a wine list. Walker said fresh New England-style seafood and lobster rolls are an underserved niche in Cincinnati. \"Nobody is blowing it out of the water, and it's something we can do very well,\" he said. \"I have my ear to the ground in this city. I know these vendors and farmers and chefs. Everything I've gone through in my past has set me up for success in this restaurant.\" Brownfield covers retail and restaurants, technology, manufacturing and courts.
