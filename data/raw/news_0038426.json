China`s Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said the vast majority of people infected by H7N9 reported exposure to poultry, especially at live markets. \nAs many as 79 people died from H7N9 bird flu in China in January alone, up to four times higher than the same month in past years. \n(With Reuters inputs) First Published: Friday, February 17, 2017 - 16:27 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:56:33.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
