VP Pence and Gov Greitens also pitch in for a few minutes to help clean up the desecrated cemetery. pic.twitter.com/DcGnqfZyXW \n— Mark Knoller (@markknoller) February 22, 2017 \nYesterday the Anne Frank Center released a statement blasting Trump for not doing enough to condemn anti-Semitism––something Sean Spicer pushed back on ––but today they posted another statement praising Pence: WHAT WE WAITED FOR – FINALLY! Thank you @WhiteHouse and @VP Pence for finally acting against #Antisemitism today. pic.twitter.com/gXrhPNdtbV \nYou can watch a clip of Pence’s remarks at the cemetery above, via CNN. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:05:23.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
