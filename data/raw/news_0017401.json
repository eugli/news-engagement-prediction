the story of the Ferguson, Missouri protests Beatrice Verhoeven   9:12 AM Magnolia \nMagnolia Pictures has acquired the North American rights to the acclaimed Sundance documentary “Whose Streets?” by filmmakers Sabaah Folayan and Damon Davis. \n“Whose Streets” tells the story of the Ferguson, Missouri protests and chronicles the lives of the activists following the shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. \nThe film premiered in the U.S. Documentary Competition at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. It is the feature film debut of writer/director Folayan and co-director Davis. See Video: 'Whose Streets?' Filmmakers Explore Ferguson, Black Lives Matter \nThe film was produced by Jennifer MacArthur in associated with her Borderline Media and alongside Flannery Miller. Chris Renteria served as a co-producer. \n“‘Whose Streets?’ is an incredibly artful and powerful film that evokes the works of great documentary filmmakers like Wiseman and Pennebaker,” said Magnolia President Eamonn Bowles. “It’s a critically important statement for these times, but also an indelible work of art.” Also Read: Zoe Lister-Jones Comedy 'Band Aid' Picked Up by IFC Films \n“We made ‘Whose Streets?’ to show beauty and dignity in the struggle for liberation,” said Folayan and Davis. “It isn’t about larger-than-life heroes like Rosa Parks and Dr. King; it’s about everyday people fighting for the right to live.” \nMagnolia Pictures is planning a theatrical release in the summer for the documentary. The deal was negotiated by Magnolia co-EVP Dori Begley and SVP of acquisitions John Von Thaden with Josh Braun, Ben Braun, Matt Burke and David Koh of Submarine and David Morrison of Thompson Bukher LLP on behalf of the filmmakers. 43 More Portraits Portraits From TheWrap's Sundance Studio Presented by Kia Niro (Exclusive Photos) \nProducer Uri Singer and actors Geena Davis, Tim Robbins, Lois Smith and Jon Hamm, \"Marjorie Prime\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nJon Hamm, \"Marjorie Prime\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nLois Smith, \"Marjorie Prime\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nUri Singer, \"Marjorie Prime\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nGeena Davis, \"Marjorie Prime\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nWriter-director Shawn Christensen and stars Elle Fanning, Michelle Monaghan, Logan Lerman, Blake Jenner, \"Sidney Hall\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nActresses Elle Fanning and Michelle Monaghan, \"Sidney Hall\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nActors Elle Fanning, Michelle Monaghan, Logan Lerman, Blake Jenner, \"Sidney Hall\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nElle Fanning, \"Sidney Hall\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nBlake Jenner, \"Sidney Hall\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nMichelle Monaghan, \"Sidney Hall\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nWriter-director Shawn Christensen, \"Sidney Hall\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nActors Julia Ormond, Martin Donovan and Peter Dinklage with writer-director Mark Palasky, \"Rememory\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nActor Peter Dinklage, \"Rememory\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nMark Donovan, \"Rememory\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nJulia Ormond, \"Rememory\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nMark Palasky, \"Rememory\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nThomas Sadoski, \"The Last Word\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nActress Shiri Appleby, actress Judy Greer, director Janicza Bravo, actress Nia Long, co-writer-star Brett Gelman, \"Lemon\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nJudy Greer, \"Lemon\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nShiri Appleby, \"Lemon\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nNia Long, \"Lemon\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nDirector and co-writer Janicza Bravo, \"Lemon\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nActor and co-writer Brett Gelman, \"Lemon\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nActor Nnamdi Asomugha, actress Natalie Paul, writer-director Matt Ruskin, actor Lakeith Stanfield, \"Crown Heights\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nLakeith Stanfield, \"Crown Heights\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nMatt Ruskin, \"Crown Heights\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nNatalie Paul, \"Crown Heights\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nNnamdi Asomugha, \"Crown Heights\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nDirector Evgeny Afineevsky, \"Cries From Syria\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nActress Alfre Woodard, actor DeRon Horton, writer-director Gerard McMurray, executive producer Common, and actors Tosin Cole and Trevor Jackson, \"Burning Sands\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nDeRon Horton, \"Burning Sands\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nAlfre Woodard, DeRon Horton and Gerard McMurray, \"Burning Sands\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nTosin Cole, \"Burning Sands\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nTrevor Jackson, \"Burning Sands\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nExecutive producer Common, \"Burning Sands\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nAlfre Woodard, \"Burning Sands\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nDirector Andrew Dosunmu, \"Where is Kyra?\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nErica Sashin, Marina Zenovich, Lynne Kirby, Stacey Offman, \"Water and Power\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nDirector Jack Henry Robbins, \"Hot Winter\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nTim Robbins, \"Hot Winter\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nDirector Kitty Green, \"Casting Jonbenet\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap \nDirector Brian Knappenberger, \"Nobody Speak\" \nPhotographed by Jana Cruder for TheWrap Previous Slide Next Slide 1 of 44 \nSundance 2017: Jon Hamm, Peter Dinklage and Elle Fanning among the stars shot by photographer Jana Cruder in Park City", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T19:34:17.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
