Be it Vicky Donor or Piku, when it comes to sketching strong and progressive characters, no one does it better than Shoojit Sircar. BBC Media Action India recently organised Needle 2017, a communication conclave on women and girls and Shoojit Sircar chose the platform to speak about the women in his films and everything in between. \nTalking about Beeji in Vicky Donor and why she has been the most progressive character till now, he said, \"One of my favourite ladies, who was the most progressive, was Beeji from Vicky Donor. She would say whatever she wanted, every evening she would sit and drink with her daughter-in-law, and they would have their own session.\" \nTalking about Deepika Padukone's forthcoming character in Piku , he added, \n\"Piku is a girl from a cosmopolitan city. She has her own responsibilities, she also has an irritating, constipated father. But, I voiced it very clearly in the film how for her marriage is not that important, virginity is not that important. She hasn't decided if she wants to settle with somebody. That's not important for her. Her father is important for her. These are the rights that women should have, and I tried to put that forward.\" \nHe also made a valid point about Bollywood refraining from casting North-Eastern characters. He said, \nYouTube Screengrab \n\"It's unfortunate that we don't know where Manipur is. In the initial draft of the film (Pink), there was no Northeastern character. I think the girl was from Tamil Nadu in the first draft. I live in Delhi and I have a lot of friends who are from the Northeast. So, when I got into the script, it was a deliberate attempt to keep Andrea in the film. I was disappointed when I didn't see a Northeastern girl in Mary Kom. It is a struggle in the film industry to get a Northeastern woman to participate. If I do a film, where I have to cast a Northeastern woman, I will definitely do it.\" \nShoojit also spoke about how item numbers are abused in Bollywood, \"Item numbers are another big challenge from the industry I have had to fight. I have to keep saying no to it. Bollywood has abused this, where they will put an item number unnecessarily in the film, and they blame the audience, and say it's for the sake of art. I have always fought the industry in the way I portray women in my films.\" Don't Miss ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:10:52.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
