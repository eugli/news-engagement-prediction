Read on to learn all about their latest offer at the position. \n\"Blessed to receive an offer from the University of Miami.\" \nThat's the announcement Joe Milton made over the weekend. At 6-foot-5 and 215 pounds, Milton is a 2018 quarterback prospect from Olympia High in Orlando. \nMilton put his name on the recruiting map with a strong junior season in 2016. While leading his team to a 6-4 record, Milton completed 46-percent of his passes for 1,543 yards, 17 touchdowns, and seven interceptions. He also added 42 yards and three scores on the ground. \nMilton's first offer came last spring when South Carolina offered him. He's added offers from Arizona, Missouri, and Miami over the last week. \nThe Hurricane signed a pair of dual-threat quarterbacks in its 2017 class (N'Kosi Perry and Cade Weldon) and now they just offered one in the 2018 class, making it very clear the type of quarterback Mark Richt wants running his offense here.
