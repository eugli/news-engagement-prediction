Article continues below \nThey were linked with making a few moves throughout the window, however, and it appears that those rumours weren't entirely off the mark. \nThe Mirror have claimed that the Premier League leaders have lined up three main targets for the summer, all of whom have been linked with the club over the last four weeks and are going to be fairly costly. Article continues below Chelsea preparing £100m summer spending spree on three players [Mirror] \nThere were more than a few whispers about Moussa Dembele during the closing stages of the window. Although the young Celtic striker ruled out a switch with an epic tweet on deadline day, the Blues are set to resume their interest in the summer. \nIt is thought Celtic are unwilling to accept any bid worth less than £40 million - a lot of money for a 20-year-old. \nAnd that isn't the only forward Conte wants to bring in. \nDespite Diego Costa's fine form this season, the Chelsea manager wants to further boost his striking options by bringing in Real Madrid forward Alvaro Morata. \nThe Spanish international has had doubts about his role under Zinedine Zidane at the Bernabeu and potentially could end his second stint at the club after just 12 months. \nChelsea's third and final target is believed to be Southampton's Virgil van Dijk. \nThe centre-back has earned a big following with his form over the last couple of seasons and Conte is almost certainly not the only manager tracking his situation. \nLike most years, Saints will be expecting plenty of big clubs interested in securing the services of their star men this summer, with Van Dijk undoubtedly one of those. \nThe Dutchman signed a new six-year deal at St Mary's last summer, though, which means a hefty fee will probably be required to convince Southampton to sell up. \nShould Chelsea somehow land all three of their prime targets, the outlay is expected to breach the £100m milestone. \nJanuary might have been quiet around Stamford Bridge, but it certainly won't be this summer. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
