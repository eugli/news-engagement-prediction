During a press conference shortly after the announcement, Haye landed a punch on Bellew after saying he would put him in hospital. Article continues below \nThey were quickly separated by security guards, though Bellew was left raging in the aftermath. \nAnother press conference has been set up for Monday and the Liverpudlian has warned if Haye tries anything silly, he won't hesitate to \"smack his f face\". Article continues below Wayne Shaw has been offered an incredible new job after his pie eating antics \n\"We've got plans for him on Monday,\" he said, per The Sun . \"He's coming to my backyard. It will be tasty. If he gets close to me and twitches in any way, I'll be the first one to smack his f face. \n\"I don't give a f*** if the fight gets called off. If he gets close, I don't care about nothing.\" \nBellew has clearly had enough of Haye's foul-mouthed, disrespectful approach to their bout next month, but it's what happens in the boxing ring that's most important. \nHaye is bookies' favourite for the fight but Bellew insists he can pull off a shock. \nIn his most recent exclusive interview with Sky Sports , the 34-year-old explained his masterplan to defeat Haye by using his \"lightning speed\" against him. \n\"After training, I was 221lbs (15st 11lbs),\" he said, \"I will come in lighter on fight night, much lighter than 221lbs. \n\"His advantage is speed - every single fight, against anyone he's fought, he's always quicker than them. So if I can get anywhere near his speed, he's in for a shock. \n\"He will whinge, he will look for a way out - but, for the first four rounds, he's as good as any heavyweight on the planet. \n\"The only guy in the heavyweight division that is quicker is Anthony Joshua. But Joshua is quicker with combination punches, he isn't quicker with a single punch. \n\"Haye is the quickest single-punching heavyweight on the planet. With one shot, he's lightning fast. \n\"But he's lightning fast to other heavyweights. He isn't quicker than some of the cruiserweights I've faced, so the speed isn't going to be an issue for me. The judging of distance will be.\" \nHaving fought lighter and faster fighters than Haye at cruiserweight level, Bellew believes he might be able to deal with the former world heavyweight champion's speed. \nHowever, he has never faced anyone as powerful as Haye, so there can be really no telling exactly how the fight will pan out. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
