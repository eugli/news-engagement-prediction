Tom McCarthy\nTrump issued an executive order on 27 January, suspending refugee admissions and banning travel from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days. The order immediately came under legal attack from plaintiffs on all sides – travelers caught up in the ban, civil rights groups, and states arguing that irreparable harm had been done to residents.\nThe cases produced multiple rulings, for and against the various plaintiffs. The broadest relief of all was granted by district judge James Robart, in Seattle, last Friday. Robart, in a ruling that did not explain his deliberations, granted a request for a nationwide order restraining the federal government from enforcing the key planks of Trump’s order.\nThe ruling set up a major fight, which will play out in the coming hour or so.\nOver the weekend, the justice department asked for an emergency hold on the Seattle ruling, which was denied, making the case a focus of national attention.\nThe restraining order issued by the district court judge applies to five sections of Trump’s executive order. Together these sections comprise the most controversial parts of the order. Sequentially, they instruct officials to:\nSuspend entry to the US, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of people from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days, excluding foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas and certain other specialty visas.\nSuspend the US refugee admissions program for 120 days.\nPrioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual’s country of nationality.\nSuspend the admission of Syrian refugees specifically.\nAdmit individuals to the US as refugees on a case-by-case basis. Today justice department lawyers will argue that these should be reinstated.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.54pm GMT 22:54\nThe court hearing is due to start shortly. Will we get a ruling today? Probably not.\nDavid Madden, a spokesman for the court, said a ruling would be more likely to come later this week.\nProceedings today are due to last around 60 minutes, with each side – the justice department for the ban, and the states of Washington and Minnesota against – granted 30 minutes of argument over the telephone.\nIt could run longer depending on questioning by the judges.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.50pm GMT 22:50\nClaire Phipps\nWelcome to live coverage of the hearing to determine whether President Donald Trump’s travel ban will – for now, at least – stand or fall.\nThe ninth US circuit court of appeals in San Francisco, a federal court, will shortly hear arguments from the justice department arguing that the executive order – which barred all visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days, and suspended Syrian refugee entry indefinitely and all others for 120 days – should be reinstated.\nOn Friday, district judge James Robart put a temporary, but nationwide, halt to the order , after hearing arguments from Washington state and Minnesota against the ban. The attorney general for each of those states will once again make their case in the hearing that is due to start imminently.\nWe will have live coverage here.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share
