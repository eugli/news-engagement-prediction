His rating remained the same and so did most of his stats but one thing we did notice was his gameface. \nTHAT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE FRANCESCO TOTTI? \nFIFA 10: \nIn the FIFA that introduced Ultimate Team, we could now clearly see Totti's rating and his 91-rated centre midfield card will go down in FIFA history as one of the greatest of all time. \nI mean, how often do you stumble across a CM with 92 shooting, 92 passing and 92 dribbling? \nFIFA 11: \nMany FIFA fans were shocked to see that Totti had significantly downgraded from the previous year, receiving an unprecedented 82-rated card, but stats of 85 shooting and 86 dribbling made him usable. \nAs you can see, the gameface is becoming more and more realistic by the year, minus that huge blip in 2009. \nFIFA 12: \nAs you'd expect at the age of 35, Totti's pace fell dramatically in this FIFA but that doesn't take away from his 84 shooting and 83 passing stats. \nFIFA 2012 was Totti's most realistic gameface yet since the start of this list in 2004 but his stats have started to plunge dramatically. \nFIFA 13: \nNot much needs to be said from this year. We all know how important pace is on FIFA and Francesco Totti's lack of it meant that he couldn't keep up with some quick defenders. \nStill, 89 passing though.... \nWhy so serious, Francesco? \nFIFA 14: \nAfter Totti was employed as a winger by Roma, FIFA decided to give him a pace upgrade of +19 from the previous year, as well as a rating upgrade of +3. \nHe even received an impressive 83-rated in-form card with 89 shooting, 90 passing and 53 pace. \nFIFA 15: \nAt the age of 37, Totti's stats decreased again but after another successful season at Roma. he famously overtook Ryan Giggs as the oldest player to score a Champions League goal. \nHe still received a respectable 80-rated card. \nFIFA 16: \nAlthough he turned 39 this year, Totti received 5 different cards throughout the season after making 15 appearances in all competitions, scoring 5 times. \nCheck out this 92-rated card: \nFIFA 17: \nAND HERE WE ARE. \nFrancesco Totti has been rewarded with another decent card at the tender age of 40 but his 38 pace will hold him back. Saying that, his shooting and passing stats are as good as ever. \nLadies and gentlemen, i give you Francesco Totti. \nLA LEGGEND", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:14:11.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
