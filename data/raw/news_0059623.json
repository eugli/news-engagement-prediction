It was a conformist type of place. \n\"There was a whole different set of rules they [the other players] could apply.\" \nWiggins - who is now training to become a professional beach volleyball player - graduated as Stanford's all-time leading scorer and was selected by the Minnesota Lynx as the No 3 pick in 2008.

You've reinforced unfair stereotypes,\" she wrote. \n\"A person's orientation is their own and their business. \n\"Now, because of your article, it is no longer out of bounds to ask WNBA players about their sexuality. \n\"Do they ask any male stars in the NBA about their sexuality? Is it even a conversation?\" \nBut Los Angeles Sparks forward and WNBA Players Association president Nneka Ogwumike said Wiggins' allegations should be taken seriously. \n\"Anything that impacts an inclusive culture should be taken seriously,\" she said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:39:19.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
