A final vote was expected on Wednesday.\nWarren took to the Senate floor to argue against the nomination, reading the letter Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 about Sessions to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which ultimately rejected his nomination to be a federal judge.\nSessions had \"used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens\" when he prosecuted voting fraud cases when he was the U.S. attorney in Alabama,\" according to the letter read by Warren.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cut her off, saying that she broke a Senate rule that \"impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama.\" Senators voted 49-43 to silence Warren.\nWarren has been a fiery critic of Trump since he launched his presidential campaign. Democrats have expressed concern about Sessions' record of controversial positions on race, immigration and criminal justice reform.\n\"Mr. President, I am surprised that the words of Coretta Scott King are not suitable for debate in the United States Senate. I ask leave of the Senate to continue my remarks,\" the Massachusetts senator responded.\nMany civil rights and immigration groups also have concerns about Sessions with the American Civil Liberties Union saying his positions on gay rights, capital punishment, abortion rights and presidential authority in times of war should be examined.\nSessions was a federal prosecutor in 1986 when he became only the second nominee in 50 years to be denied confirmation as a federal judge. This came after allegations that he had made racist remarks, including testimony that he had called an African-American prosecutor \"boy,\" an allegation Sessions denied.\nSessions said he was not a racist, but he said at his hearing in 1986 that groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union could be considered \"un-American.\" He also acknowledged he had called the Voting Rights Act of 1965 a \"piece of intrusive legislation.\"\n(Reporting by Doina Chiacu in Washington and Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Frances Kerry)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T16:43:50.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
