Who will succeed Rafael Correa? \nMr Correa, who was elected in 2007 and is unable to stand again, oversaw an economic boom during his 10 years in power. \nBut a slump in the price of oil meant the oil-exporting country was unable to continue supporting its poverty reduction programmes, and was criticised for not putting money aside for hard times. \nRecent corruptions scandals have also cast the ruling party in a more negative light, and some have speculated that Ecuador will follow Peru and Argentina in electing a conservative government. Image copyright EPA Image caption Candidates need 40% of the vote to avoid a second round run-off \nCentre-right Mr Lasso, a former banker, wants to create a million jobs. \nAmong his other election pledges is one to withdraw asylum rights from Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who has been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since June 2012. \nHowever, Mr Moreno, a key figure in Mr Correa's cabinet between 2007 and 2013, is predicted to win Sunday's vote, but not with enough to avoid the second round run-off. \nMr Moreno, who became paraplegic after being shot in the back in 1998, has most recently served as UN Special Envoy on Disability and Accessibility. \nVoting is mandatory in Ecuador, and 12 million people are expected to cast their ballot on Sunday, starting at 07:00 local time (12:00 GMT), with polls closing at 17:00 local time (22:00 GMT). \nResults are expected from about 20:00 (01:00 Monday, GMT).
