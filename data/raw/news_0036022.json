For that long (and still abbreviated) list of reasons it&apos;s nice to see him back in the headlines for, you know, his actual music.\nOn Thursday his entire video for Tunnel Vision , produced by Metro Boomin and Southside, came out. As you can probably tell from a certain hat that you may&apos;ve seen on the heads of some senior citizens in Florida, he&apos;s not exactly trying to win over the Trump crowd with this release.\nRelated The 'Cash Me Ousside' Girl Didn't Get Paid for That Kodak Black Video (UPDATE) Kodak Black Shades Hurricane Chris While Chilling in His Swimming Pool Kodak Black Broadcasts Hotel Room Sex on IG Live, Gets Dragged The video was previously teased from his Instagram account last December.\nIn case you&apos;re wondering what his immediate future holds, he&apos;ll also be one of the many performers on the upcoming Nobody Safe Tour , which will run from May 4-June 30. Other artists on said tour will include Future, Migos, Tory Lanez, Young Thug and ASAP Ferg. You can check out if and when that show is stopping anywhere near you right here .\nTickets will be on sale for it on Friday.\nTags: News , Videos , Music Videos , Kodak Black", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSUgOmP66Q", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQgGZPOl6Jh/", "http://www.youtube.com/user/complexmagazine?sub_confirmation=1"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:03:37.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
