And in September of last year, he listed his five penthouses that are in the same building in downtown Los Angeles. \nYes, you read that right. Five penthouses, same building. Together, they were listed for $12.78 million, but they have been selling individually. \nOne penthouse sold in October 2016, with the second in November 2016. \nAs you can see in the photos of the apartments, Depp's style is anything but minimal. His colorful and bold aesthetic is just what you'd expect from the man behind Captain Jack Sparrow. \nDepp made use of all five penthouses, but never bothered to connect them into one unit, so they could be sold separately. \nAccording to real-estate agent Kevin Dees of Partners Trust , Depp had doorways installed to connect three of the units. The “Pirates of the Caribbean” star purchased the units for around $7.2 million between 2007 and 2008. The penthouses are in the landmark Art Deco-style Eastern Columbia Building in downtown Los Angeles. JAMES LANG/BERLYN Eastern Columbia Building looks gorgeous in the LA sunlight. JAMES LANG/BERLYN Together, the multi-floor (and adjacent) penthouses have 9 bedrooms and 14 bathrooms, totaling 11,500 square feet. JAMES LANG/BERLYN Four of the units have two bedrooms, and one unit is a one-bedroom. JAMES LANG/BERLYN Depp used one penthouse as an art studio.

JAMES LANG/BERLYN Depp decorated the penthouses with bright colors and eclectic art, including a mural by Os Gemeo, a Brazilian street artist.
