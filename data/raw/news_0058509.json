It is likely to be completed by May, 2018. \n“During the study, routes of the about 10km stretch will be finalised. The elevated corridor will end at the airport approach road so that congestion at Dhaula Kuan can be avoided,” said a PWD official. \nThe bridge will reduce traffic congestion in the entire central Delhi and Barapullah will act as a link between NH24 in the east and NH8 in the west of the city. \n“People can reach the airport from east Delhi in 40 minutes against the 90 minutes needed now. We have proposed a bicycle track as well,” the official said. \nBut construction of the Barapullah Phase III project — Mayur Vihar-1 to Sarai Kale Khan — has been delayed by five months and PWD officials hoped to finish the job before May next year. \nWork is stuck because the PWD needs to acquire 8.5 acres on the eco-sensitive Yamuna floodplain to build pillars. Sources said if the acquisition is not completed by March, more delay can be expected. \nOnce completed, the bridge will decongest Sardar Patel Marg, the Ridge area, Chanakyapuri, Lodhi Road and Teen Murti Marg. \nRead: AAP govt’s plan to decongest Delhi with elevated corridors runs into railway hurdle \nMotorists can drive on the elevated road from Mayur Vihar to INA, without the hassle of waiting at traffic signals. The bridge will decongest the Ring Road and NH24. \nBarapullah is Delhi’s first elevated corridor and was commissioned during the 2010 Commonwealth Games when the link from Sarai Kale Khan to Nehru Stadium was opened. \nAs part of the Phase II extension, three loops were opened this January. These came as a boon for travelers from Maharani Bagh, Sidhartha Enclave, New Friends Colony and Sarita Vihar. \nThe road will be extended till INA market as part of the Phase II project and work is likely to be completed by this March. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:11:52.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
