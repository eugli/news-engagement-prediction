Eugene Whyte recalled bonding with Molloy after 9/11 when they were tasked with the grim job of identifying slain police officers. \nMolloy was quick to comfort any cops who walked into the morgue and appeared overwhelmed by the sight of the fallen officers, Whyte said. \n“He was down to earth and took good care of his guys,” Whyte said. \nA slow-rolling vintage green emergency service vehicle ferried Molloy’s casket to the church. \nThe hundreds of cops gathered outside gave Molloy a final salute as six officers hoisted his flag-draped coffin onto their shoulders and marched into the house of worship.
