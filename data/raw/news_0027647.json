He was 95. \nHe died Feb. 1 in the Denver suburb of Lakewood, said his daughter, Kerry Tipper. \nEdward Tipper was a member of the famed Easy Company, part of the 101st Airborne Division, and parachuted into France as part of the June 6, 1944, Allied D-Day invasion. \nThe company’s exploits were retold in “Band of Brothers,” based on research by historian Stephen Ambrose. \nPentagon launches effort to solve a baffling WWII mystery \nTipper was interviewed for the series and was portrayed by actor Bart Ruspoli. A few days after the parachute drop, Tripper’s eye and leg were badly injured by a mortar shell. He was hospitalized for a year. \nTipper was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. Doctors gave him a list of things he couldn’t do, but that became a checklist for things to master, his daughter said. \n“He was defiant above all,” she told The Denver Post. \nHe took up handball, not because he liked it, but to prove he could do it, she said. He was an avid skier and kept that up into his 80s, Kerry Tipper said. \nDedicated soldiers helped break U.S. Army color barrier \nAfter the war, Edward Tipper attended the University of Michigan and the University of Northern Colorado — then the Colorado State College of Education — and became a teacher. \nHis first teaching job was in Iowa, and then he returned to Colorado, teaching English and literature and running drama programs in Jefferson County on Denver’s western edge. \n“So much of what people talk about with him is what he did in the war. That was two years and really six days starting on D-Day,” Kerry Tipper said. “Teaching was 30 years.” \nEdward Tipper will be buried at Fort Logan National Cemetery.
