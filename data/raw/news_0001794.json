The answer is a resounding no, especially considering consumers’ fleeting attention span. \nA study by marketing data science company Genesis Media found that 90 percent of consumers aren’t likely to buy something they saw advertised during the Super Bowl. The reason? Brand metrics such as “favorability” or “recall” don’t result in purchases for products featured in Super Bowl ads. \nMaybe that’s why Kraft Heinz decided against spending $5 million on an ad that won’t sell one ounce of ketchup. The company announced that they’re giving all 42,000 of their salaried employees Super Bowl Monday off, hoping the earned media value will exceed what they would have paid for a coveted spot on Fox this Sunday . \nIt’s a great example of how brands are thinking differently about creative ideas, tactics and execution. \nIt is also a sign of the changing times. For the last few years, the strategic execution of Super Bowl ads has changed from a one-time event on Super Bowl Sunday , to using an ad as a springboard to launch integrated digital and social media campaigns. Research from last year’s Super Bowl suggested that Super Bowl ads in 2016 generated as much as $10M in incremental exposure for advertisers. \nSome brands go overboard on concept, like Mercedes-Benz, which last year relocated its N. American headquarters to Atlanta. The venerable luxury car brand hired The Coen Brothers to direct an “Easy Rider” themed Super Bowl spot featuring Peter Fonda. That’s easily an eight-figure budget for an ad that, if the studies are accurate, won’t sell many cars. \nSo does that mean that Super Bowl ads are all about brand awareness? Not really. A full 75 percent of respondents from the Genesis Media study said they couldn’t remember ads from the previous year. \nAdvertising technology company Fluent surveyed 1,600 Super Bowl watchers in 2015 to test the effects of five first-time ads, finding that the average \"brand lift\"– whether viewers could recall advertisers after their first Super Bowl ad – was just 12.7 percent. \nThat’s not an ROI that many brands can readily justify, and the main reason why the Super Bowl will remain the ultimate arena for the advertising budget haves and have-nots. \nAbout the Author \nBill Coontz brings large agency-management experience to the Dalton Agency.
