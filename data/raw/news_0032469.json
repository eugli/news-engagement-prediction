At least, it never was to me. It meant you won a championship and you got to experience something cool with your team, with your teammates. Everyone has their own choice. It’s an offseason. These days are valuable for everybody. You only get so much time with your family and friends, and if people don’t want to go they don’t want to go and that’s their choice.” Donna Connor via Getty Images Tom Brady said that when “ putting politics aside, it never was a political thing \" for him. \nMultiple Patriots players have said they will skip the trip, including free safety Devin McCourty . “I’m not going to the White House,” McCourty told TIME. “Basic reason for me is I don’t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won’t.” \nTrump and Brady have known each other for years, and the POTUS claimed to have Brady’s vote back in November. \n“Tom Brady, great guy, great friend of mine, great, great champion, unbelievable winner,” Trump said at a November rally . “He called today and he said, ‘Donald, I support you, you’re my friend, and I voted for you.’” \nGisele later denied it. But either way, Trump ― who is also friendly with team owner Robert Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick ― was happy the Patriots won . What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow! — Donald J.
