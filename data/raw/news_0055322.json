He spoke with WXYZ-TV Channel 7 reporter Brad Galli who asked him about Brady's missing jersey. \n\"Tom Brady's jersey, is it underneath your shirt right now or in your basement hanging up?\" \n\"No, I didn't take Tom Brady's jersey, replied Wahlberg.\" \"It's funny, he was playing Riviera today, the golf course. They had to send a picture and they told my buddy who works at the golf course to give me crap because I had to leave the Super Bowl. But, he doesn't know what it's like when his son is melting down.\" \n\"I really got the best of both world's because I got to be at the hotel by the time they won the game, so i didn't have to deal with the traffic and the craziness. It was my wife's first first football game ever, going to a Super Bowl.\" \nThen, Wahlberg revealed this to Galli: \"He knows who has his shirt.\" \nWahlberg left it at that. So, the mystery continues for everyone else, except for Wahlberg and Brady apparently. \nBrady says he \"absolutely put the jersey in his bag\" after the big game. Meantime, the former University of Michigan quarterback posted a \"list of suspects' on his Instagram page as the search continues for the most coveted jersey in sports.
