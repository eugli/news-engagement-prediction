By Michael Paulson Image Hillary Clinton chatting backstage with Glenn Close, star of “Sunset Boulevard.” Credit Bruce Glikas/FilmMagic, via Getty Images In many ways she is the typical Broadway audience member: a woman of a certain age, affluent and highly educated, living in suburban New York. But there’s one big difference: She was almost president of the United States. In the weeks since losing the election, Hillary Clinton has gone to four Broadway shows — often enough that industry wags joke about making her a Tony voter. And she’s even been spotted at theater district haunts — last week, just before seeing a revival of “Sunset Boulevard,” she had dinner at Orso with Kate McKinnon , the “Saturday Night Live” cast member who memorably portrayed her during the campaign. At each theater appearance, Mrs. Clinton is greeted as a vanquished hero — standing ovations, selfies, shouted adulation. The reception, of course, is in striking contrast with that received by Mike Pence, then the vice president-elect, when he attended “Hamilton” in November. He was greeted by a smattering of boos and then addressed from the stage by an actor who said cast members were “alarmed and anxious” about the incoming administration. Mrs. Clinton has been attending Broadway shows for years, often when she has had a personal connection to an artist, a producer, or to a show’s subject matter. In 2003, while a New York senator, she showed up at “Avenue Q.” (The show’s director, Jason Moore, is from Arkansas.) In the years since, she has been to “Henry IV,” “South Pacific,” “The Last Ship,” “You Can’t Take It With You,” “The King and I,” “An American in Paris” and “The Audience” (the last starring Helen Mirren as another powerful woman, Queen Elizabeth). “She’s always been a strong supporter of the arts, so it doesn’t surprise me that she’d want to spend her time this way,” said Heather Hitchens, president of the American Theater Wing . “The theater community is grateful for her presence.” Some visits have been especially memorable. In 2015, a few days before Mrs. Clinton declared her candidacy for president, she showed up at “Matilda the Musical” (about a fierce and smart young girl overcoming considerable obstacles) and was singled out during an audience participation segment. She raised her hand as someone who loves books, and was teased for her passion by an actor singing about the virtues of television. Mrs. Clinton did not respond to requests for comment, but the theater community has had plenty to say. “I hope I write a play that goes to Broadway so Hillary Clinton can see it,” one playwright, Jaclyn Backhaus (“ Men on Boats ”), tweeted. I hope I write a play that goes to Broadway so Hillary Clinton can see it — Jaclyn Backhaus (@jaclynbackhaus) February 16, 2017 Here is a look at what brought Mrs. Clinton to the theater.

Credit Apples and Oranges Studio ‘Sunset Boulevard’ WHEN Feb. 16, 2017 WHY Glenn Close — both for her much lauded performance as Norma Desmond and because she is a high-profile supporter of the Democratic Party. Ms. Close memorably spoofed Mrs. Clinton at the 2016 Tony Awards (“I really need this job!”), but also contributed to her campaign. NOTES The musical, about a once-beloved star eager to reclaim the spotlight, features the big song “As If We Never Said Goodbye.” Hillary Clinton two rows behind me at Broadway's \"Sunset Blvd\" tonight. Got a standing ovation. She looked good, and happy. — Richard Zoglin (@rzoglin) February 16, 2017 Image Former President Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton with the cast and crew of “In Transit.\" Credit Bruce Glikas/FilmMagic ‘In Transit’ WHEN Feb. 1, 2017 WHY The lead producers, Janet and Marvin Rosen, are close to the Clintons; Mr. Rosen is a former finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee. NOTES The a cappella musical is a bit of a love letter to New York City; among its characters is a female subway attendant (played by Moya Angela) who reads “Lean In” and, at the end of the show, dons a red pantsuit and decides to run for mayor. No word on whether Mrs. Clinton might do the same . Hillary and I loved visiting with the cast and crew of @InTransitBway , a moving, creative story of different lives coming together. https://t.co/Dmf2HSAJm5 — Bill Clinton (@billclinton) February 2, 2017 Image Jayne Houdyshell and Mrs. Clinton with the actress's “I’m With Her” buttons. ‘The Humans’ WHEN Jan. 15, 2017 WHY Among the play’s lead producers was Barry Diller, a major campaign supporter. The drama, about a family under economic strain, won the 2016 Tony Award for best new play; Mrs. Clinton attended the final performance. NOTES The show’s leading actress, Jayne Houdyshell, lightheartedly adopted Mrs. Clinton’s campaign slogan, “I’m with her,” on buttons to boost her own prospects during Tony Awards season. She had better luck than the candidate, taking the theater prize for best featured actress in a play.

Ms. Clinton showed up, with her husband and daughter, at the final show. NOTES A woman long mistreated and underestimated by men overcomes her challenges and, along the way, discovers a love for colorful pants.

WHY Duh. But, also, the July 12 performance was a campaign fund-raiser. NOTES Politicians from both parties (notable exception: Donald J. Trump) have embraced the show, written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, for celebrating America’s revolutionary history and ideals. — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) July 12, 2016 Image The Clintons at “All the Way.” ‘All the Way’ WHEN June 8, 2014 WHY A case study in legislative legerdemain: Robert Schenkkan’s drama explored how President Lyndon B. Johnson (Bryan Cranston) persuaded Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. NOTES A few hours after the Clintons attended, the show won the 2014 Tony for best new play.
