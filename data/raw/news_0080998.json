Cue up the funky soundtrack, because according to BioWare Edmonton general manager Aaryn Flynn, Andromeda is going to be a very sexual kind of science fiction adventure. Talk about action RPGs, right? Right? Remember. We lost the \"partial nudity\" rating and got full \"nudity\". https://t.co/yauGf9Cnol February 26, 2017 \nMass Effect and Mass Effect 3 both had \"partial nudity\" content descriptors from the ESRB. I remember it turned into a Whole Thing on the mainstream news networks way back when. Well, talking heads, get a load-a this! @Lady_Alenko @N7Follower Yes it's totally softcore space porn February 26, 2017 \nOk, so Flynn was mostly joking with that last tweet. Here he is after everybody in the office was probably like \"WTF man you can't call our video game softcore porn\". Sorry, I gave the wrong impression. We have strong characters, great gameplay, romances, and more, all dealing with mature themes. https://t.co/GAy6ZIzIPC February 27, 2017 @of_somebody Yes definitely. Our developers worked extremely hard to bring these characters to life in a responsible way. My bad word choice February 27, 2017 \nSo don't worry if you cringe at the thought of more video game banging (even if it is \" pretty good \"), Mass Effect: Andromeda isn't a non-stop space orgy. In fact, it will be much easier to keep things just friendly between main character Ryder and potential romantic partners, according to Andromeda lead designer Ian S. Frazier.
