Many people are so blinded by their hatred of Donald Trump that they fail to recognize, or work to actively justify, their own intolerance.\nIf the Left is sincerely interested in restoring civility and respect to politics, liberals must acknowledge their own failures instead of reflexively lashing out at well-intentioned people of faith.\nEmily Jashinsky is a commentary writer for the Washington Examiner. \nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton calls on Trump to speak out against anti-Semitism She said he needs to be the first to speak out\nBy Kyle Feldscher â€¢ 02/21/17 8:36 AM Top  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:50:09.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
