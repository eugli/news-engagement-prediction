The world’s creepiest scoutmaster, bakery owner Pete Schweddy, and Gary Jonas also can’t be overlooked. Of course, the thing these men all have in common is Alec Baldwin, their smooth-talking portrayer set to host his record-setting 17th episode of Saturday Night Live this weekend. \nBaldwin’s been a constant fixture this season as President Donald Trump , but this week, he’ll take on more than the combover and hand gestures as the man of the hour and a half. In honor of the gig, EW has rounded up sketches from each of his episodes as host, stretching all the way back to 1990. Watch the funny videos below. \n1. “Brenda the Waitress,” 1990 Following a stellar monologue in his first hosting gig, Baldwin delivers a hilariously understated bit as a rogue cowboy full of sexual innuendos at Jan Hooks’ diner. \n2. “Lank Thompson: Handsome Actor,” 1991 Lank Thompson (Mike Myers) may be handsome, but no one’s more handsome — or hilarious — than Alec Baldwin playing himself, employing all the clichés audiences have come to expect from attractive actors. Also of note is the appearance by a young Conan O’Brien, who was a writer on the show at the time. \n3. “Tipping” monologue, 1993 If you ever wanted to catch Baldwin, Lorne Michaels, and Paul McCartney in a scene together, this monologue, where Baldwin goes behind the scenes to tip crew members, is your shot. \n4. “Canteen Boy and the Scoutmaster,” 1994 In one the most famous SNL sketches ever, Baldwin plays the increasingly pervy scoutmaster to Adam Sandler’s naïve canteen boy, who is actually 27. It’s cringeworthy to say the least, but Baldwin still brings the laughs. \nRELATED: Hear more of the latest TV news from this week \n5. “The Baldwins Play Family Feud,” 1994 Baldwin hosted this episode with then-wife Kim Basinger, and he recruited brothers Billy and Stephen to join them as an out-of-touch version of themselves on Feud . \n6. “The Joe Pesci Show,” 1996 Baldwin nails his cool, calm, and collected impression of Robert De Niro opposite Jim Breuer’s spot-on Joe Pesci. \n7. “Sentimental Yard Sale,” 1997 Baldwin and Molly Shannon learn the first lesson of yard sales the hard way: Don’t give away things you still care about! Or maybe do, depending on your level of heartless-ness. \n8. “NPR’s Delicious Dish Schweddy Balls,” 1998 In what is arguably one of the funniest sketches to ever grace the SNL stage, Baldwin drops by Ana Gasteyer and Molly Shannon’s NPR radio show to tout his bakery’s famous specialty, Schweddy balls. This sketch was such a hit that Ben & Jerry’s named an ice cream flavor after it in 2011. \n9. “Inside the Actors Studio,” 2001 SNL had spoofed the James Lipton-hosted show before, but never like this. Alec Baldwin nails his impression of longtime Match Game panelist and actor Charles Nelson Reilly. \n10. “Love-ahs,” 2002 This sketch, featuring the rather passionate love-ahs Will Ferrell and Rachel Dratch, is odd to say the least, but features Baldwin’s British accent and a cane, so it’s got that going for it. \n11. “Prince Charles,” 2003 More British accents! This time Baldwin is Prince Charles’ private secretary Sir Anthony McCollum, who must deal with the British press’ hilarious innuendos regarding rumors pertaining to the prince’s sexuality. \n12. “Glengarry Christmas,” 2005 In Santa’s workshop, Baldwin can hardly contain his laughter as he accidentally slips out of character and quotes directly from Glengarry Glen Ross , his 1992 film he was spoofing. \n13. “The Tony Bennett Show,” 2006 Baldwin had been imitating the legendary singer for years, but his impression proved it held up when the real Bennett dropped by. \n14. “Fourth Jonas,” 2009 You know Nick, Kevin, and Joe, who were at the peak of JoBro mania when this sketch aired. But how about Gary? That’s right — there’s a fourth Jonas Brother, and for some reason, he looks a lot like Alec Baldwin. \n15. “Swim Team Awards,” 2010 Come for the absurd wig, stay for the nasty burns Baldwin throws at the members of the high school swim team he coaches. \n16. “All My Children Wrap Party,” 2011 Art imitates life for the cast and crew of All My Children , as they shut down their long-running soap opera with a series of wild twists and turns.
