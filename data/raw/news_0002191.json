Sporting News \nPublished on Feb. 2, 2017 \nUpdated at 5:34 a.m. ET \nAnthony Milford hasn’t even put pen to paper yet and already he’s setting records at the Broncos, with the club tabling the biggest offer in Brisbane’s history to keep the playmaker at Red Hill. \nMORE: Ask The Lurker: What the Sharks really think about Barba saga \nThe Broncos have reportedly offered a record contract worth $2.7 million, after Ben Hunt was snatched up by the Dragons for 2018 and beyond on a cool $6 million deal. \nShould Milford agree to the deal, he will remain in Brisbane for the next three seasons, according to The Courier Mail ’s Peter Badel. \nThere were rumours Wayne Bennett was unhappy with Ben Hunt throughout last season, however others have suggested the master coach was keen on keeping Hunt in Brisbane alongside Milford long-term. \nAnd while that scenario will not play out, Milford has reportedly told his current club he is not looking for a move, but rather a contract that accurately represents his value. \nIt looks as though that is exactly what he is going to get, however the 22-year-old’s manager has confirmed his client won’t be signing a contract until the 2018 salary cap has been finalised. \n“We are going to do our due diligence and ensure we are on the mark,” agent Sam Ayoub said via The Courier Mail . \n“We have to get this deal right. There is no ulterior motive, we’re not looking at other clubs… we just need to do our homework.” \nAyoub confirmed that rival clubs had approached Milford about the possibility of moving, however those offers would not be considered. \nMilford is set to line up for the Broncos at this weekend’s Auckland Nines.
