'Greater risk' \nGuide Dogs NI has released You Gov research showing almost three quarters (72%) of people have been affected by vehicles parked on the pavement. \nOver half (55%) have said cars parked on pavements make it harder for them to walk along pavements and 45% said they have been forced into the road. Image copyright PSNI Image caption The back of a flyer police are distributing to badly parked cars \nPeople living with sight loss, older people or those using wheelchairs, are at greater risk. \nNinety-one per cent of respondents living with sight loss who responded to a previous Guide Dogs survey said that parked cars on the pavement regularly obstruct them. Image caption Guide dog owner Diane Marks, from Belfast 'Terrifying experience' \nAndrew Murdock from Guide Dogs NI, said: \"Imagine how scary it is for people without sight to have to walk in the middle of the road because the pavement is blocked?\" \nGuide dog owner Diane Marks, from Belfast, struggles on a daily basis with the number of cars that park on the pavement. \nDiane said: \"Going out into the road is something that I have just had to get used to, but it can be a terrifying experience, I've had so many near misses with cars and I rely so heavily on being able to walk down the street safely. Image caption Diane Marks and her guide dog walk past a car parked on the pavement \nStephen Mathews, CEO of The Cedar Foundation said: \"We hope that it will raise awareness among drivers across Northern Ireland to consider the impact that careless parking can have on people with mobility difficulties and others.\" \nInspector Rosie Leech, PSNI added \"Think about how a blind person might feel when confronted by a situation where their guide dog cannot negotiate past a parked car and is forced to detour onto the carriageway where live traffic is running. \n\"This danger is further exacerbated as they have no way of knowing whether this car is the only impediment ahead.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:32:32.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
