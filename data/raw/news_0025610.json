Now, Rayo has a new cause for you to get behind.\nRayo and Jarod Neece authored last year's travelogue The Tacos of Texas which we profiled here at Chron.com. The 448-page book takes readers on a taco tour of the Lone Star State, touching on the best joints big and small across the land.\nEAT AND READ: Finally someone has written the definitive bible on the tacos of Texas\nThis week Rayo appeared on radio program Texas Standard to argue that the official dish of Texas should actually be tacos, and not chili as it has been since 1977 .\nThat year the Texas legislature officially proclaimed chili to be Texas' official state food \"in recognition of the fact that the only real 'bowl of red' is that prepared by Texans.\"\nForty years was a good run, according to Rayo. Right about now some of you chili-heads should look away.\n\"Whether you grew up here in Texas or you got here as soon as you could, you're eating tacos,\" Rayo said Thursday. \"People here eat tacos five days a week. Tacos were here before Texas was Texas.\"\nEven better, Rayo says, that tacos are uniquely Texas.\nHOUSTON TACO CRAWL: These are the best tacos in Houston\n\"Tacos were not imported here. They're from here. They're from this land. They're from the people,\" he told host Casey Cheek.\nHow about we just put chili in a tortilla and call it even?\nLearn how to make your own flour tortillas for taco night with this easy recipe and technique.\nMedia: Brandpoint With the Texas legislature back in session, maybe Rayo can get the attention of some lawmakers in Texas and make something happen. Petitions come first\n\"We got to go find a hungry legislator that loves tacos,\" Rayo says. \"If you are out there give me a call.\"\nWe're waiting for a retort from the folks in Terlingua .", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/52/11045552/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/53/11045593/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/37/15/6681428/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/27/26/8484236/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/27/26/8484236/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/37/15/6681428/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/texas/state-food-agriculture-symbol/chili", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/42/52/26/9086364/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/27/26/8484230/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/23/46/27/5137906/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/53/11045595/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/53/11045594/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/27/26/8484233/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/52/11045552/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/53/11045572/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.texasstandard.org/stories/case-for-making-tacos-the-official-dish-of-texas/", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/42/52/26/9086364/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/27/26/8484235/6/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/53/11045571/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/53/11045595/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/76/11046807/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/76/11046807/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/27/26/8484235/6/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/53/11045572/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/52/11045551/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/27/26/8484230/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/27/26/8484233/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/23/46/27/5137906/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/53/11045594/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/52/11045551/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/53/11045593/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/52/10/53/11045571/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-10T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:18:52.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
