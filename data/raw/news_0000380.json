He also points out that the order actually already includes a provision that allows DHS and the Secretary of State to issues visas and entry permissions on a “case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest.” \nMicrosoft’s request for special permission seeks to take advantage of this allowance to grant entry permission to anyone who already has a work or student visa (or is related to a visa holder and granted access under their permit), hasn’t committed any crime, is looking to travel for work or family emergency for no longer than two weeks and said travel would not include the countries named in the order when done for work purposes. \nThe argument is basically that the roles these individuals fill are already in the national interest, whether at work or in pursuit of education, and so there should be blanket coverage for them under the existing order’s structure. \nAgain, Microsoft isn’t saying it’s okay with the order provided these allowances are made; it’s still very much of the opinion that even if this proposal goes through, it “will not and shot not end the border debate and deliberations regarding last week’s executive order,” so it’s good to see it pursuing both near-term relief for affected individuals and pushing for long-term solutions. 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T19:37:55.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
