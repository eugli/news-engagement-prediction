Something that is clearly demonstrated by the numbers. India has moved from 150th position to number 1 in terms of mobile data usage worldwide. A significant portion of this data is consumed in the form of video. Jio is one of the largest mobile video networks globally. \nJio consumers have used 200 crore minutes of voice and data. \nJio users consumed more than 100 crore GB of data in the last one month. That is more than 3.3 crore GB per day. The company has added 7 customers per second for 170 days since its official launch. \nBy the end of 2018, Jio network will be present in all the cities, villages and cover 99 percent of the country's population, promised Ambani. According to him, superior network and customer experience is making Jio the operator of choice. \nWith Aadhaar-based processes, mobile portability has become easier. \"I hope more Jio-based users will opt for MNP and make it permanent,\" Ambani said. \n\"Jio is trained to be a customer obsessed organisation. We are obsessed to deliver world class quality,\" he said. \nAmbani promises to increase the 4G Base station coverage by 2x more in the coming months, to ensure that Jio covers 99 percent of India's population. \nJio has twice the number of 4G base stations all the other Indian operators put together have, said Ambani. \n( Disclosure: Reliance Jio is owned by Reliance Industries, who also own Network18, the publisher of Firstpost )", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:18:16.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
