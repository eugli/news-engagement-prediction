Here’s how to get it done. Download ePSXe \nThere are a few different emulators you can use, but ePSXe is the most popular, and has gotten updates as recently as October 2016. So we’ll be using that one. If you have recommendations for different emulators, please share them below! \nTo get started, head over to ePSXe’s website and download the app. There’s no installer file, so you’ll just need to unzip the folder and move the files to wherever you want them. I created an ePSXe205 folder in the Program Files (x86) folder and extracted the files there (ePSXe is a 32-bit app, so it belongs in the x86 folder).

If you don’t already have a PlayStation BIOS installed, you’ll see a warning and have to install one (remember that if you don’t own a PSX, downloading the BIOS is piracy). Just run a search online for “epsxe HLE BIOS” and grab the file called scph1001.bin. When you’ve downloaded it, extract the zipped file to the bios folder in your ePSXe folder. \nIf you’ve done it correctly, you’ll now see SCPH1001.bin in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ePSXe\\bios . If you’re on 32-bit Windows, this will be in the Program Files folder instead. \nNext, you’ll see a menu with a couple different graphics drivers and some suggestions.

When you’re done, hit OK at the bottom of the screen and Next >> in the configuration window. And don’t worry, you can always adjust these options from the Config menu later. Sound and Controller \nThe sound drivers window does the same for sound. Accepting the default ePSXe driver is probably fine, but if there are others available, you can choose to configure one of those. Hit Config for a few options, then hit OK and Next >> . The CD-ROM plugins are up next; if you’re using Windows 10, select ePSXe CDR WNT/W2K core 2.0.0. Hit Next >> . \nFinally, you’ll set up your controllers . ePSXe support a number of different controller setups. Click the dropdown menu in the top-right corner to select the device you’ll be using; the screenshot below shows the setup for using a standard keyboard. Once you have the keys mapped how you want them (just click on a letter and tap the key you want to replace it with), hit OK and Next >> .
