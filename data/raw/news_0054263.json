It means it’s possible the 31-year-old could leave Old Trafford within days. Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nBut having missed the last few games due to injury, Rooney has returned to training and is available for Sunday’s trip to Wembley to face Southampton. Whether he has a role to play in the final could make up his mind on whether to remain at the club. \nMourinho has refused to rule out the possibility of Rooney leaving over the next few days. \n‘You’ll have to ask him. I can’t guarantee that I am here next week, how can I guarantee that a player is here next season? \n‘If Wayne does leave, it is not because I want him to leave, that is all I can guarantee. \n‘I will never try and push a legend of this club to another destiny.’ Rooney with Mourinho (Getty) \nIt’s also been reported that Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is happy for Rooney to leave the club immediately should he so desire.
