NZ said the country may be facing a melanoma epidemic. \nThe price to slop on sunscreen is leaving some feeling burnt in the pocket. \nThe price of a 200ml bottle of reputable brand SPF 50 sunscreen ranges from about $13 to $20 at two of New Zealand's major supermarkets. \nMelanoma is one of the most serious types of skin cancer and accounts for nearly 80 per cent of all skin cancer deaths in New Zealand. 123RF \nMore than 350 New Zealander's die each year from melanoma. \nOn average 350 people die each year from melanoma, that is nearly one person every day. \nRead more: \nPeople have voiced their concerns about the price of sunscreen on social media site Neighbourly.co.nz, with many saying they would like to see it subsidised by the Government. \nCam Morris from the Auckland suburb of St Heliers said the removal of GST \"seems like commonsense\". \n\"Coming from the States, I was shocked at price of sunscreen,\" Morris said. \n\"When friends and family visit, I advise that they definitely bring their sunscreen from home,\" he said. \nJarrod Hedley from Onehunga said he would like to see sunscreen funded through Government drug agency Pharmac as a \"preventative medicine for the skin\". \nHe said it should be able to be accessed through a prescription, although he acknowledged this could potentially mean funding being reduced for other prescribed medicines. \n\"Even if it was only available to children it would be a start,\" he said. \nSarah Robertson from Mt Wellington said the high price has put her off buying a bottle before. \n\"I'll make do with old stuff, which probably isn't very effective anymore,\" Robertson said. \nHarriette Carr, deputy director of public health for the Ministry of Health, said the ministry was not considering subsidising sun screen. \n\"If the ministry were to consider this, there could be an argument that we should also consider subsidising clothing, sunglasses, and sun hats which is not practical or realistic,\" Carr said. \nCarr said the ministry supports the message of \"slip, slop, slap and wrap\". \nIn 2009, a report carried out by the Cancer Society determined that skin cancer costs the New Zealand health system about $57 million a year but the Cancer Society believes this figure has now risen. \nCancer Society spokeswoman Fiona Mawley said education was key to avoiding skin cancers. \n\"Subsidising sunscreen would be a great way of helping to reduce the problem of skin cancer but that could be balanced with education around skin safety,\" Mawley said. \n\"Informing people on how to use the sunscreen properly along with other sun smart behaviours would go a long way to decrease our skin cancer rates,\" she said. \nThe CEO of Melanoma NZ Linda Flay said recent research showed the country was facing a \"melanoma epidemic\". \nFlay said the number of people diagnosed in New Zealand was predicted to increase by 50 per cent of the next 20 years. \nCountdown online sunscreen prices \n* Cancer Society
