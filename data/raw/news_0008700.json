Sylhet | Update: 18:38, Feb 01, 2017 0 Like \nSylhet college girl Khadija Akter, who was brutally hacked by a former BCL leader Badrul, returned home after a four-month medical treatment. \nShe reached Sylhet with her brother Shahin Ahmad by air flight at about 2:30pm. Family members welcomed her there. \nOn 3 October afternoon, the BCL leader chopped the MC College student indiscriminately. Local people rescued Khadija and took her to MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital. As her health condition deteriorated, she was shifted to Square Hospital in Dhaka. \nBadrul was then caught red handed by locals and handed over to the police. He is now in prison. \nOn 28 November, Khadija was admitted to Centre for Rehabilitation of Paralysed after preliminary recovery. \nHer brother Shahin told journalists that his sister was taken to Sylhet for a week. She will again be taken to the CRP for further treatment. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:07:08.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
