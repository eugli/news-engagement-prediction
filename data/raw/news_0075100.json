I felt like I should get the expensive one but I’ve wasted money on something I don’t need.”\nThe public servant from Sydney is a classic case of someone left bamboozled and battered by the overabundance of choice.\nA recent shopping trip to buy a new phone seemed simple enough but when faced with a dizzying choice of features and prices, she cracked.\n“I was trying to make a decision very fast and I went for the expensive phone with all the gadgets, which I just don’t use. I made the wrong choice.”\nMs White’s experience is far from unusual. New research from comparison website Choosi has revealed 60 per cent of Australians suffer from analysis paralysis, or that the more choice they have, the harder it is to actually decide.\nWhich Australian organic extra virgin cold-pressed olive oil on special should I buy this week? Source: ThinkStock \n\nThe confusion created by choice has gotten so bad that big supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths have been cutting brands and ranges in the face of the success of Aldi that only stocks a few thousand lines.\nBut there are some nifty ways to cut through the choice fog — from the “70 per cent rule” and a US President’s streamlined decision-making strategy to simply settle for less.\n“Whether it’s cars, groceries or hotels, if we go back to the 1950s or 60s there were very few brands and very little choice,” Associate Professor Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, told news.com.au.\nToday, department stores and supermarkets stock tens of thousands of products, brands and pack sizes for every possible want.\nDoes having this much choice in yeast extract make us happy? Source: News Limited \nTake yeast spread. Despite Vegemite being the most popular brand, Woolies also sells Promite, MightyMite, OzeMite, Marmite and Our Mate spreads.\n“The mindset was, if we give everyone a wide choice, that’s a good thing. But studies have shown when you give consumers infinite choice, selection becomes problematic and cognitive stress increases,” said Prof. Mortimer.\nBarry Schwartz, author of The Paradox of Choice , wrote that increased choice and frustration go hand-in-hand.\n“We end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from.”\nOne of the reasons is because of the anxiety of “missed opportunities”, focusing on what you didn’t choose rather than what you did.\nRather than enjoying your yummy yeast spread, you wonder if the spread left on the shelf may have been yummier. It’s the shopping equivalent of FOMO — the fear of missing out.\nTom Godfrey, Head of Media at consumer group CHOICE, agrees.\n“When it comes to making complex decisions, such as choosing the right health insurance policies from the 48,000 on the market, this explosion of choice can leave consumers feeling anxious as making the wrong decision can prove costly.”\nAldi is succeeding despite it’s product range being many times smaller than the major supermarkets. Source: News Corp Australia \nConsumers are their most choosy when doing the grocery shopping. But in other areas, like financial services, we are paralysed by choice.\n“That’s because choosing, say, an electricity provider, is not a pleasurable experience so we will stay with that utility because it’s just not worth the hassle making a decision again,” said Dr Mortimer.\nThe Choosi research showed three in five (61 per cent) of Australians believed having so much choice makes it harder to choose. While 80 per cent feel the abundance of products has made them question their value.\nOne third of people believe that in 10 years’ time the sheer amount of choice will be overwhelming.\nChoosi spokeswoman, Katrina Foster, told news.com.au that assessing choices is befuddling.\n“While choice can make our day-to-day living simpler, it can also be a hindrance. Aussies want to feel confident that they’re making smart, well-informed decisions and that starts with a thorough understanding of the options.”\nIt will come as no surprise that Choosi, a comparison website specialising in insurance, recommends those wanting to make a decision about insurance should visit a comparison website.\nBut there are other solutions to help you separate the product wheat from the choice chaff.\nConsumers can be weighed down by choice.

So if it’s price, a brand or extended warranty, don’t be bamboozled by the plethora of choice,” said Prof. Mortimer.\nTHE 70 PER CENT RULE \nLouis C.K, admittedly a comedian rather than a behavioural psychologist, has some advice for poor decision makers. Settling for less can lead to more.\n“My rule is that if you have someone or something that gets 70 per cent approval, you just do it,” he told GQ. \nOnce you choose, your stress levels go down, so now it’s 80 per cent great, he said.\n“And when you get to 80 per cent, you work. You apply your knowledge, and that gets you to 85 per cent. And the thing itself will always reveal itself … to be more than you thought.\n“And that will get you to 90 per cent. After that, you’re stuck at 90, but who the f*** do you think you are, a god? You got to 90 per cent? It’s incredible.”\nUS President Barack Obama had several strategies to simplify choice.

Source: AFP \nDON’T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF \nMost decisions are not about life and death, they’re about Surf or Radiant, full fat or diet.\nPresident Barack Obama, indeed, did have more pressing things on his mind. But even he only had three answers — “agree”, “disagree” and “let’s discuss” — so most matters were resolved swiftly.\n“You need to focus your decision-making energy. You can’t be going through the day distracted by trivia,” he told Vanity Fair. \nThe Nurofen Specific Pain range looked like it gave you an abundance of choice. But all the products were the same. Source: Supplied \n\nSNIFF OUT FAKE CHOICES \nLast year, Nurofen makers Reckitt Benckiser got a multi-million dollar fine for offering customers a choice of products that were, actually, all identical.\nThe ingredients of Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Back Pain were exactly the same. But if you were a back pain sufferer with a migraine you may have needlessly bought both.\nThe small print did detail the ingredients but, nonetheless, they were fined $6m for misleading customers.\nUnit pricing can help you make a choice on the best value product — if price is your main criterion. Source: News Limited \nIGNORE THE MARKETING, SEEK THE TRUTH \nSeek out the truth from the marketing mayhem such as unit pricing in supermarkets or financial product disclosure statements.\n“In the supermarket, big brands often dress up simple commodities such as coffee and milk with fancy packaging and marketing claims to give you the semblance of choice, when in reality there can be little to differentiate between brands, making it vital for consumers to compare products using the unit price to determine the true value,” says CHOICE’s Mr Godfrey.\nMs White is currently on the lookout for health insurance, a painful task.\nHer solution is to scour websites and forums for independent advice and then create a spreadsheet with a list of her needs and see who measures up.\nIt may not be quick, but she’s be stung once before. “Now, doing my own research means I know what I get is what I’m really after.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:24:31.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
