(Fox 2 Detroit) \nRon Savage, FOX 2 anchor and reporter, died Saturday morning while training with the Milford Fire Department. \nRon suffered a cardiac issue during training exercise with the Milford Fire Department where he volunteered. Ron was 63 years old. \nOn Sunday, Ron was planning to climb the stairs for the Fight For Air Climb at the Renaissance Center tower. Ron was volunteering to climb the stairs to raise money for the American Lung Association and was a regular in the annual event. \nFOX 2's General Manager, Mike Renda released this statement: \n\"We are shocked and saddened to hear of the passing of our colleague Ron Savage. Ron was a shining example of an individual who gave everything he had to his family, community and to Fox2. He was a consummate professional serving as both our weekend anchor and late evening reporter. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this difficult time.\" \n\"FOX 2 and the community have suffered an immeasurable loss,\" said vice president and news director Kevin Roseborough. \"Ron's ceaseless positive energy and larger than life personality meant so much to so many. He was a skilled reporter and anchor, a trusted colleague, and anyone who knew Ron had an appreciation for his booming voice and laugh. You couldn't help but smile when you were around him.\" \nAn EMMY Award-winning journalist, Ron co-anchored Fox 2 News Weekends with Amy Lange. He produced Michigan's Most Wanted segments, highlighting crimes that needed to be solved. Police say more than 1,000 dangerous fugitives have been arrested from tips from FOX 2 viewers. \nAside from his hard work at the station, Ron served his community as a volunteer firefighter and EMT with the Milford Fire Department. \nHe was a decorated firefighter who earned two citations for outstanding performance above and beyond the call of duty - one during a commercial factory fire and another for rescuing a critically injured driver from an overturned 18-wheeler. \nRon also volunteered with Crime Stoppers, The Humane Society, The Autism Society of Michigan, MADD and The American Lung Association. \nA big camping enthusiast in both the upper and lower peninsula, his favorite hobby was cooking - specializing in BBQ smoked ribs, \"low and slow\" as he liked to say. \nHis favorite quote came from his late father, a WWII veteran: \"You don't have to be perfect, just do your best.\" \nRon is survived by his wife and son. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:02:11.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
