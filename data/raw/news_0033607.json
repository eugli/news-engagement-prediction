Photo: Kate Geraghty \nThe 41-year-old stood in the dock, but did not react when the jury delivered its verdict in the Downing Centre District Court. \nThe Crown's case was that the woman was heavily intoxicated when she was picked up by Naveed near The World Bar in Kings Cross in the early hours of October 18, 2015. \nProsecutor James Trevallion said Naveed stopped to buy condoms and a bottle of water at a petrol station before encouraging the woman to get into the back seat and raping her. \nThe trial heard that the woman, who had an estimated blood alcohol concentration of .231 at the time, had only a partial memory of the night and woke up to find Naveed having sex with her.

Do you have a boyfriend'?\" \nNaveed told the court they then started kissing but he told her he did not have a condom. \n\"She said: 'Don't worry about protection',\" Naveed said. \n\"I said: 'I don't know you, you don't know me, how I can trust you'? Then she said: 'We can get condoms'.\" \nThe court heard that Naveed stopped and bought the condoms and water before pulling over in a quiet street in Sydney's eastern suburbs. \nNaveed said they both climbed into the back seat of his car, but he could not get an erection. \nAt one point during his evidence he sobbed repeatedly \"she trapped me\". \nNaveed will be sentenced at a later date.
