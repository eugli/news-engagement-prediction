The US and the UN Security Council have already declared the JuD and its sister organisation, the Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation, as fronts for the LeT.

A senior police officer told the Dawn newspaper that the Counter-Terrorism Department added their names to the Fourth Schedule on the orders of the federal interior ministry. \nThe Fourth Schedule imposes a wide range of restrictions on the movements and activities of a listed person. Such a person is not allowed to visit schools, colleges and other educational institutions, parks, hotels and public places, airports, railway stations, TV and radio stations or attend public rallies and meetings. \nUnder the provisions of this schedule, authorities can probe the assets and sources of income of the listed persons and their families to ascertain whether the assets are legitimate. These restrictions can be applicable for a maximum of three years. \nBesides Saeed, the other JuD and FIF members against whom action has been taken are Abdullah Ubaid, Zafar Iqbal, Abdul Rehman Abid and Kashif Niazi. Saeed and 37 others have also been barred from travelling abroad as they were included in the interior ministry’s Exit Control List.

The JuD has also said it will mount a legal challenge to his house arrest. \nThis powerful army has backed Saeed’s detention, saying it was a policy decision taken in the national interest. \nSaeed was also put under house arrest after the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, but he was freed within six months on the orders of the Lahore high court. \nCritics have also pointed out that the interior ministry has done little to fully enforce the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act. A list of persons included in the Fourth Schedule that was drawn up by the National Counter-Terrorism Authority (NACTA) last year contained the names of several persons who were dead or had even left Pakistan. \nLeaders of the banned Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat included in the Fourth Schedule have attended rallies and even gone for the Haj pilgrimage. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:43:21.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
