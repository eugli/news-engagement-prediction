Ted Cruz , Republican of Texas; Steve Bannon , former Breitbart chief executive turned White House strategist; and Reince Priebus , former head of the Republican National Committee, who now serves as President Trump 's chief of staff. \nThe public rebuking of Spencer by the conservative mainstreamers will undoubtedly infuriate the neo-Nazi followers of the “ alt-right ” personality, many of whom are segregationists who believe the American government should institute policies giving special consideration to a group of people they unscientifically categorize as “the white race.” \n“There is a sinister organization that is trying to worm its way into our ranks,” said Dan Schneider, the executive director of the American Conservative Union, which runs CPAC. “We must not be deceived by [a] hateful, left-wing fascist group.” \nSchneider’s use of the term “left-wing” to describe the “alt-right” is not new, but relies on traditional definitions of what it means to be “left” or “right” politically; the Nazi Party of Germany was considered a left-wing group because, at the time of its ascendancy, it professed to oppose government control and speak on the behalf of the working class. \nBut with regard to America, the traditional spectrum means very little in modern politics. While feigning an aversion to government regulation—an attribute of the historic left, but not the American left—the Republican Party is considered to be of the “right wing,” partly due to its stance on numerous social issues, and because it remains combative towards workers’ rights. (To further complicate matters, “conservatives” in the United Kingdom, for instance, support abortion rights and same-sex marriage.) \nSchneider’s definition, therefore, seems likely to be an attempt to further distance Trump’s Republican Party from the overwhelmingly detested rhetoric of Spencer’s white-nationalist babble. \n“They hate the Constitution. They hate free markets. They hate pluralism,” Schneider further explained to the Washington Post . “Fascists tend to want big government control.” (Fascism typically falls on the far-right of the traditional political spectrum, which, as explained, means little in American politics.) \nIan Walters, a CPAC spokesman, told NPR that Spencer was unwelcome because his views are “repugnant and have absolutely nothing to do with conservatism or what we do here.” \n“He's anti-free markets, anti-Constitution, anti-pluralism,” Walters added, indicating by use of language mirroring Schneider’s that CPAC had given some thought to how it would react to Spencer’s presence. “This was one bad egg who bought a ticket.” \n“People want to talk to me,” Spencer told NBC News outside the event. “They don’t want to talk to these boring conservatives. They want to learn about ideas whose time has come, not whose time has passed.” \nSpencer’s rise to infamy followed a post-election shindig in which he cried “Hail Trump” while his supporters threw up Nazi salutes , and it was furthered by footage of him getting punched hard in the face while giving an interview during a post-inauguration protest. \nBy all known accounts, his favorite color is white and his favorite animal is the frog , certain species of which are known to spontaneously change genders. \nSpencer's expulsion follows CPAC's decision to boot scheduled speaker Milo Yiannopoulos , who in a less-than-year-old YouTube video espoused sexual activity between men and boys, comments he has since admitted may have been “flippant.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:25:42.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
