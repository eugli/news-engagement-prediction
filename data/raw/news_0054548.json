What was the solo queue like? I feel like people didn’t throw games as much as they do in the US solo queue. If you get ahead in the Korean solo queue then you win, but in the US solo queue, if you’re ahead, then sometimes you lose because people do something stupid and die. \nMisfits were outliers at the beginning of the season but you’re standing toe to toe with seasoned LCS teams. How? I think everyone is really motivated and hungry to play. We have two rookies who want to prove that they’re worthy of the LCS and perform their best. We have KaKAO, a veteran who is one of the most passionate League of Legends players I’ve ever known. He’s excited in every solo queue game and every scrim, even if something goes wrong, which is unusual. \nPersonally, I’ve wanted to prove I was way better than people were saying regarding my time at Origen . Everyone is really motivated to prove their worthiness. They’re doing really well and proving a lot every week. \nThe goal is to get to playoffs and maybe even get to first place. PowerOfEvil \nHow far do you think the team can go? It’s still Week Five so it’s hard to say what we can eventually achieve. I think that for [the team] the goal is to get to playoffs and maybe even get to first place, and our second goal is to get points for Worlds. We want to perform as well as we can and try to reach the highest possible place, but we’re not frustrated if we lose a match or lose a series, but we should just take it as a learning experience. \nHow are you finding the new 10-ban system? It’s like a fresh start, but I don’t think it changes too much. People said it could completely ruin your champion pool but I don’t think that will happen because you can always pick the mid laner in the first or second rotation and normally there aren’t enough bans to remove all relevant mid laners or junglers or AD carries . It doesn’t mean doom for champion pools but you can do little tricks like banning mid laners then taking the two best remaining so there aren’t really good counter picks, or you can take a cheesy mid laner pick and ban some picks against it. You just need to be a really smart drafter. \nSo we’re not going to see a player’s entire champ pool banned out? No, this is just way too risky as you can’t tell if this guy is currently playing two or five or six champions. Also, if you ban three or four mid laners then you’re sometimes destroying some of your own champion pool. If you ban a certain amount of mid laners then other mid laners get really strong. How do you know that your opponent isn’t playing on another account with a cheesy pick which becomes super strong when banning all the other champions? You need to be sure and confident that if you ban out their best mid laners you still get a lot from it. \nA strong pick in your own pool is Corki. He’s usually an ADC, what makes him work in mid lane? He’s a strong mid laner because in the laning phase you can go exhaust against other champions so there’s not a lot of danger of dying 1vs1. He also has a lot of map pressure and dive potential in the side lanes with his package, which spawns after eight minutes. You can use the package to contest objectives or amp up the pressure temporarily, which is a really strong tool in competitive play. Corki also has such a long range and his ultimate deals a lot of damage. There’s a massive power spike when buying Trinity Force because of his damage scaling. He’s kind of an AD carry but with Corki the most important thing is getting levels and you can do that in the mid lane more than bot lane. He's won four out of five series © Riot Esports Flickr \nAgainst Fnatic in Week Three you chased Soaz and Amazing across the map to secure two kills. How do you get away with such aggressive play, even as Corki? Essentially we got a really good catch. I decided to package in and chase at the start, but it looked like it would be hard to keep chasing so I was asking in comms if we should just go for a turret or something, but my team was really confident in me catching them. They were screaming “chase chase chase we have Mikael’s, we have two Redemptions” so they kept screaming that I should chase and I focused on doing that while dodging and hitting every spell. My team took care of the rest. It was a lot of fun in the end getting both of them. \nWho on the team is making these daring calls? Mostly IgNar and Alphari are starting the conversations. They say what lane they want to play for or go to, and then it’s everyone talking about which lane we should go to, or “should we play around this?” The team itself is shot calling a lot, but Alphari and IgNar are the instigators. It starts people talking which is really good, but mostly people know where to go.
