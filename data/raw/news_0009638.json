Former Tech wide receiver Kevin Cone will be the new assistant director of operations.\nCone replaces Craig Candeto, who has become the new quarterbacks and B-backs coach, taking over for Bryan Cook, who left to become offensive coordinator at Georgia Southern. Hamilton replaces Brad Waggoner, who took a job as head coach and athletic director at Trousdale County High in Hartsville, Tenn., in December.\nHamilton coached against coach Paul Johnson in the Southern Conference 1997-2001 when both were first-time coaches, Hamilton at East Tennessee State and Johnson at Georgia Southern. He has since been at Elon and then the past 10 years at Division II Brevard. He resigned at the end of this season. At ETSU, his athletic director from 2000 into 2003 was Todd Stansbury, now Tech’s AD.\n“As a longtime coach, he has an experienced eye for talent that will be a terrific asset for us in our player personnel area,” Johnson said in a statement.\nCone played for Tech 2008-10 before a six-year professional football career, including three seasons with the Falcons. Cone, who earned a mechanical engineering degree, worked for engineering firm Morrison Hirshfield prior to his hire in the football office.\n“I’m excited to welcome Kevin back to The Flats,” Johnson said in a statement. “He’s a very talented young professional with a great passion for Georgia Tech and a first-hand knowledge of our program.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T09:13:07.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
