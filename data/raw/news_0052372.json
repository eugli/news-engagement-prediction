Ferne had that look of love when gazing into Lee's eyes (Photo: Channel 4) \nBut she couldn't risk Jorgie Porter bagging a date with her crush, like last time, so she decided to get her claws into him quickly. \nHow? By repeatedly telling him that she fancied him and that she loved his hair. \nAnd then there was \"the Instagram incident\". Ferne asked Lee if he had Instagram and then demanded to look at his account. She really fancied Lee (Photo: Channel 4) \nHe somewhat nervously handed his phone over and she immediately began questioning who a woman was in one of his photos and why he had hashtagged it 'Always'. \nWhen Nadia came over to see what on Earth was going on - and tell her to chill out a bit - Ferne brandished the phone in her direction and told her Lee has \"got a bird\". \nBut when he explained it was his ex and they broke up in September, she was back to telling him she fancied him again. She couldn't hide the joy from her face (Photo: Channel 4) \nCome on, Ferne, play it a bit more cool than that! \nWith Ferne getting a talking-to from Nadia and his phone safely back in his hand, Lee widened his eyes at one of the other men at the mixer in surprise. \nBut he couldn't have been put off, because he immediately snapped up a date with her when she offered. Lee had to show her his Instagram account (Photo: Channel 4) \nShe was labelled a 'bunny boiler' on Twitter, in reference to the film Fatal Attraction where a spurned woman gets revenge on her lover. \nIt didn't even end there. When Ferne reunited with dating experts Eden Blackman and Nadia Essex at the agency, she told them to get ready for her wedding and started claiming she was in love with Lee - despite the fact they haven't been on a date yet. \nShe also insisted they had amazing chemistry and kept looking at each other from across the bar. \nLet's see how their date goes before we buy our hats. \nCelebs Go Dating returns tonight at 10pm on E4.
