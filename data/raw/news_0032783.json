House justice committee chairperson Reynaldo Umali defends the death penalty bill on February 15, 2017. Screenshot from congress.gov.ph   House justice committee chairperson Reynaldo Umali said on Wednesday, February 15, that data is \"not necessary\" in the discussion surrounding   for heinous crimes. The Oriental Mindoro 2nd District Representative made this statement when anti-death penalty lawmaker Agusan del Norte 1st District Representative Lawrence Fortun threw at him one statistic after another showing the decreasing crime rate over the years. During the resumption of the debate on House Bill Number 4727 , Fortun brought up the 1987 Constitution provision that allows Congress to reimpose the capital punishment if it finds \"compelling reasons involving heinous crimes.\" \"What could be one of these compelling reasons, Madame Speaker? Maybe widespread criminality involving heinous crimes could be a compelling reason,\" said Fortun, who then asked Umali if he knew about the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). Umali said he did and brought up People vs Echegaray , the Supreme Court (SC) decision that upheld the death penalty conviction against Leo Echegaray in 1999. \"I have already stated pertinent portions of People vs Echegaray where the Supreme Court ruled that these data or statistics are not necessary for purposes of reimposition of the death penalty,\" said Umali. \"In fact, as I mentioned in previous responses I made, if you will just read the papers, watch television, and/or listen to radio, on a daily basis, you will hear that these crimes are committed left and right. And to me, that is how to view that there is a compelling reason for  ,\" he added. Fortun then cited PSA data showing there has been \"a significant decrease every year in the crime rate in the country.\" \"I would like to read for the record, Madame Speaker, it says here that for reported crimes total for index and non-index crimes in 2009 there was 502,665. In 2010, there's 324 083. That's a decrease of about 200,000. And in 2011, from 324,083 it decreased to 246,958. And in 2012, it decreased further to 217,812,\" said Fortun. He also cited data from the Philippine National Police's Annual Report in 2015 , which showed a decrease in the number of crimes from 2014 to 2015.
