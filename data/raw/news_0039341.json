Shaub wrote that “there is strong reason to believe” that Conway’s actions “violated the standards of conduct [for federal employees] and that disciplinary action is warranted”. Government employees are prohibited from using their official positions to promote commercial products.\nIn an appearance on Fox and Friends on 9 February, Conway promoted Ivanka Trump’s branded apparel after Nordstrom, the department store, announced it would no longer carry the president’s daughter’s branded merchandise. “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff, is what I would say. I hate shopping – I’m going to buy stuff today,” said the top White House adviser. \nConway went on to add: “It’s a wonderful line. I own some of it. I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.”\nThe statement violated government ethics rules and led to Conway being “counseled” in the words of the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer. He declined to give further details.\nThe letter, copies of which were also sent to the chair of the House oversight and government reform committee, Jason Chaffetz, and to Elijah Cummings, the committee’s ranking Democrat, described Conway’s actions as almost perfectly matching a hypothetical used to illustrate prohibited conduct in government ethics training.\nKellyanne Conway’s White House gaffes: three strikes but not yet out Read more \nThe letter was sent in response to a query by the two members of Congress after Conway’s original comments, which Chaffetz at the time described as “wrong, wrong, wrong”.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:49:18.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
