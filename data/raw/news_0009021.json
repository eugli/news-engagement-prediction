He is again in the fray from the same seat as an Independent candidate and is looking forward to a double hat-trick win. \nRaja Bhaiya has been a Minister in the governments of Kalyan Singh, Ram Prakash Gupta, Rajnath Singh and Mulayam Singh in the past. He is now in the Akhilesh Yadav Cabinet. \nFormer MLA, Bargadikot dynasty’s Kunwar Ajay Pratap Singh alias Lalla Bhaiya is in the fray from the Colonelganj seat of Gonda on BJP ticket. Mr. Singh has been a five-time MLA. \nAnother royal Mayankeshwar Sharan Singh is contesting from Rae Bareli’s Tiloi seat on BJP ticket. He has been an MLA thrice but lost the previous polls on SP ticket. \nIn Allahabad, Baraon dynasty’s Ujjwal Raman Singh is contesting on SP ticket from Karchhana seat. His father Reoti Raman Singh is a senior SP leader and sitting Rajya Sabha member. \nIn eastern Uttar Pradesh, Kunwar Shivendra Singh of Siswan dynasty is contesting on SP ticket from Siswan in Maharajganj district. \nAmethi is also going to witness a ‘rani versus rani’ battle, with Congress MP Sanjay Singh’s wife Amita Singh likely to take on his first wife Garima Singh, who is contesting on BJP ticket. \nThe Samajwadi Party gave ticket to sitting MLA and controversial leader Gayatri Prajapati in the Congress bastion, leaving Amita in the lurch. \nMs. Amita, however, is in no mood to relent. “Amethi is my family and my home and I cannot leave it...I will contest from here,” she said. \nGarima Singh is the niece of former Prime Minister V.P. Singh and is a descendant of the royal family of Daiya and enjoys fair amount of support of local residents. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T09:42:21.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
