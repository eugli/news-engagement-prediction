According to Smith, a team led by Dilip Rajan, on the development side, and Mat Honan, on the tech coverage side, created the bulk of the product throughout the holidays and into January of this year. \n“I do think this is a central crisis in media now,” Smith told Adweek, “something that underlies a lot of the conversations around fake news and trust in the media. This seemed like one modest way to get at it.” Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:58:08.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
