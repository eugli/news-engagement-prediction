Entrants simply type in their postcode and email address. \nMr Holbrook, 38, of Finsbury Park , initially gave away £10 a day on FreePostcodeLottery.com, which he ran in his spare time while working as an IT consultant in the City . \nAs interest grew and advertising revenue surged, he gradually raised the prize fund to more than £700 a day, with rollover prizes of up to £2,400. \nThe site now has 300,000 visitors a day and has given away more than £300,000 in prizes in the past six years. \nThe work has become a full-time job for Mr Holbrook and the eight employees he has had to take on, earning them more than £1 million a year. \nThe business succeeded despite being besieged by internet trolls, including a Scottish user who posted: “Its a f g scam, all the winners [are from] England, they live in bought houses in cul de sacs and they all have hanging basket[s].” Read more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T13:05:29.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
