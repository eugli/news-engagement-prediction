LBC Izzet told Nigel Farage immigration had had a \"negative\" effect on Britain \nIzzet responded: “Yes I do - I came to this country 15 years ago from Turkey as a businessman and I can see a big difference in the UK. \n“I can see a big change in a negative way in the UK and our lifestyle, for example; keeping British [values]. \n“Compared to 15 years ago the standard is not the same as before. We have a right to control our borders.” EPA Izzet told Nigel Farage he would not support a Trump-style travel ban \nHowever, the Turkish national was hastened to add he would not support a travel ban in the UK similar to the one implemented by Donald Trump. \nThe President has temporarily barred citizens from seven mainly Muslim countries entering the US after signing an executive order on Saturday. \nIzzet criticised Mr Trump’s legislation for “discriminating against people based on their race”. \n“I don’t think Donald Trump is making the right decision,” he said.
