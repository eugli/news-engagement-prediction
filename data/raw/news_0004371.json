The suit argued that the travel ban targets Muslims and violates constitutional rights of immigrants and their families.\nThe ruling, made at the request of Washington and Minnesota, is the broadest to date against Trump's executive order.\nTrump's action bans people from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Sudan and Somalia from entering the U.S. for 90 days. It also temporarily halts the United States' refugee resettlement program for 120 days, while indefinitely suspending resettlement for refugees from Syria.\nThe executive order, issued last Friday, immediately stirred controversy when travelers who were en route to the U.S. when it was signed were detained at airports. Protesters have demonstrated at airports across the county.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://walter.thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/317884-washington-state-judge-halts-trump-immigration-ban-nationwide", "http://www.thehill.com/"], "published": "2017-02-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T16:08:32.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
