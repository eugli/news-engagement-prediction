The pay of older millennials in their early 30s actually started to slow before the crisis hit. \n\"One of the most striking shifts in the labour market has been young people prioritising job security and opting to stick with their employer rather than move jobs. \n\"This may be understandable in a jobs market characterised by rising temporary work and zero-hours contracts. \n\"With the typical pay rise for a job mover in their mid-20s at around 15%, and evidence that employers have essentially stopped rewarding their long-serving staff with real annual pay increases, such job loyalty can be very costly.\" Last updated Thu 23 Feb 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:31:23.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
