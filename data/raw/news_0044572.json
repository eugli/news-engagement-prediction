I strengthened my front side during the offseason and it's helped my direction, and I think it could up my velocity a tick or two. I already see it.\" Wood strikes Jay out swinging LAD@SD: Wood whiffs Jay to end the 5th inning Alex Wood strikes out Jon Jay swinging to end the bottom of the 5th inning \n\"This was my first little hurdle. We'll do a few things to help my recovery, and I've already seen the benefits of that. My stuff, mechanically, I'm as complete as I've ever been. I'm excited about the spring and even more excited about the team we've got. I've been champing at the bit to get out there.\" \nKershaw, meanwhile, said he was glad to get this assignment out of the way and is ready for his first exhibition game, probably on Sunday. \n\"This day is always not the most fun. It's about as low-adrenaline as you can, and you have to try to be competitive,\" he said. \"Overall, it went OK, and I got it out of the way and can pitch in a real game now. You've got to get your work in. It's necessary. You can't go bullpens into a game, you need to face hitters before a game. It's the same progression since I've been here.\" Ken Gurnick has covered the Dodgers since 1989, and for MLB.com since 2001.
