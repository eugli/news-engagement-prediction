The warrant was issued Jan. 27 of this year. \nThe tax warrant follows Trump’s recent woes with retail giants Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus removed her shoe brand from their shelves. \nHowever, this isn’t Trump’s first runaround with sketchy business practices. \nIn 2015 Madison Avenue Diamonds was ordered to pay KGK Jewelry LLC $2.375 million plus interest for breaching contract agreements. Per the contract, Trump’s company was to sell KGK’s product under the Madison brand but make monthly payments back to KGK. Only the first month’s payment was ever received. Trump’s company argued since a shipment was received a day late, it was no longer required to make payments. \nLast year, Italian shoe company Aquazzura filed a lawsuit against Trump’s shoe brand for allegedly stealing a product design. The case hasn’t been decided on yet. \nA representative for Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry was not immediately available for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:14:16.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
