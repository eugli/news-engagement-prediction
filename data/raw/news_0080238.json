He then collected all their firearms and fled the scene.\nBritish and US forces suffered their heaviest casualties of the war in the province in years of fighting following the removal of the Taliban in 2001.\nAfghan security forces now control less than 60 percent of the country, according to US estimates, with the Taliban holding about 10 percent and the remainder contested between various armed groups.\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T12:51:19.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
