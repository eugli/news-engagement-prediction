Daily Edition Jimmy Fallon's Trump Anchors His Own News Network 7:51 AM PST 2/22/2017 by THR Staff \"The only way to ensure that the news you're watching is not fake is if I'm the one delivering it,\" the 'Tonight Show' host says in character as the president. \nJimmy Fallon brought out his presidential impersonation so he could launch Trump News Network on Tuesday night. \n\"It's time for me to take matters into my abnormally gigantic hands,\" said Fallon as Trump, decrying the \"fake news\" media. \n\"The only way to ensure that the news you're watching is not fake is if I'm the one delivering it,\" continued Fallon. \"Which is why I'm starting the Trump News Network.\" He explained that the network would be 112 percent factual, and his first story was that Sweden is \"still reeling from Friday's incident which absolutely did happen,\" referring to Trump's mention of a nonexistent incident in the country. \n\"Nextly in sportsly, a new study finds that golf totally counts as work,\" said Fallon, before going to a Betsy DeVos impersonator for the weather report. At the end of the segment he presses a \"bad thing button\" that informs him there's been a Godzilla attack in Finland. \nBack in the fall, there were rumors that if Trump lost the election he would start a media network. Triumph the Insult Dog even held a fake casting call where conservative anchors auditioned for Trump TV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:16:56.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
