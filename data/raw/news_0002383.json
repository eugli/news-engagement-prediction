So we’ve always been philanthropic. Well, to the Liberal Party. I contributed $1.75 million, that was the contribution I made. It has been talked about and speculated about but there it is. $1.75 million. That’s a substantial contribution, I can assure you we make big contributions to many important enterprises and causes. I’ve always been prepared to put my money where my mouth is.”\nMr Turnbull originally declined to disclose his contribution to the Liberal Party when quizzed on the sum after his speech to the National Press Club today. But he responded to questioning on 7.30. \nEarlier, Greens electoral spokeswoman Lee Rhiannon said the donations laws were “utterly inadequate”.\n“They encourage a cosy relationship between political parties and vested interests,” she told AAP.\n“It seems Prime Minister Turnbull has used a loophole in the donations laws to avoid scrutiny for another 12 months.\n“The Prime Minister won’t even tell the public how much he bankrolled his own party. His response is that he has complied with all the rules — and to that the Greens say the rules must change.”\nNick Xenophon has also donated to his party.
