So it’s not surprising that Raisman said she felt strong and confident rather than nervous during a photoshoot for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue . \n“[You] surprise yourself how comfortable you are when you’re shooting,” Raisman said during a sit-down conversation with model Chrissy Teigen and SI Swimsuit Editor MJ Day at an event this past weekend in Houston. “It was one of my favorite days of my life — I’m not just saying that — because I felt so confident, so strong, so feminine, and it’s an incredible feeling, because I feel like a couple of years ago I wouldn’t have had the confidence to do it.” Advertisement \nThough the Needham native spoke about being comfortable shooting the Swimsuit issue, and has previously talked about her confidence shooting ESPN the Magazine ‘s Body Issue in 2015, she also recently opened up in an Instagram video about being made fun of by her classmates for how her body looked when she was younger. \n“When I was younger I used to get made fun of by the boys in my class,” she said in the video. “They told me that I was too strong, that I looked manly, and that I was anorexic and looked like I was on steroids. Of course, that really bothered me, and I used to hate the way that I looked, which, looking back, it makes me feel really sad. But that’s why I’m so proud to be in the SI Swim 2017 issue, because at 22 years old I feel strong and beautiful in my own way, and there is no perfect body type.” \nAt this week’s event, Raisman told Teigen, “I’m sure you can agree, it’s so empowering to be out there [modeling]. You have insecurities, like everyone else. Your body’s not perfect, but you feel confident and beautiful.” \n“What on earth is your insecurity?” Teigen responded. “Please tell me.” Advertisement \n“Everyone has insecurities,” Raisman said. “I used to be so insecure; I thought my arms were too muscular, but now I’m growing to like them.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:57:57.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
