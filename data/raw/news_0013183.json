Anthony Brown will be joining Steve Harvey’s radio show. (Manny Hernandez/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   7:00 PM \nTV and radio star Steve Harvey is having the last laugh against rival DJ Tom Joyner. \nFor weeks, Joyner has been urging fans who are upset about Harvey meeting with Donald Trump to tune into his radio show instead. Now, Harvey (photo) has fired back by hiring Joyner’s sidekick, J. Anthony Brown. \nIt was announced on Dec. 1 that Brown, who’d been with “Tom Joyner Radio Show” for more than 20 years, would be leaving with one month still remaining on his contract. Now, Confidential has learned that not only will Joyner land on his feet — he’ll also have a chance to step on his former boss’ toes while doing so. We’re told he’s going to start any day now. \nShortly after his departure from Joyner’s show, where he didn’t get to say goodbye on the air, Brown took to Twitter to say why he left. \nSteve Harvey in talks with 'Scandal' fixer to reverse the damage \n“Sometimes people just disagree and part ways,” he wrote. “That’s just what happened.” \nIt’ll be interesting to see how Harvey and Brown get along now that they’re on the same team. In a 2015 interview floating around YouTube, Brown claims he prefers working for Joyner because he can take a joke. \n“Tom has built a niche of a show where any minute, anyone can be the butt of the joke,” Brown said in his comically raspy voice. “I can listen to some other shows, where if you joke, the star of the show, I’m not calling anybody’s name — Steve Harvey — but he’s going to do another 20 minutes on you about how he didn’t like the joke you did about him.” \nBrown said Harvey’s “shtick” “works for him,” but cited it as a problem he didn’t have on Joyner’s show, which is syndicated in more than 100 markets. \nHarvey, who’s ending one TV show in May and starting a new one in the fall, reportedly plans to move his radio show from Chicago to Los Angeles. \nA rep for Brown did not return an email for comment.
