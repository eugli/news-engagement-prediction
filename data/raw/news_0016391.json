It beggars belief you would test your bike in circumstances like this.\n“But I am perturbed that, not withstanding your knowledge of bikes, you were not aware of the speed you were doing. Therefore I cannot deal with this other than with a custodial sentence.”\nThe visibly shocked Gray was also disqualified from driving for five years and ordered to resit the extended driving test before being allowed back on the road, reported the Daily Record . \nGray, of Aviemore Holiday Park, was caught by a police speed trap on September 7, 2015. He admitted driving dangerously.\nWillie Young, defending, said Gray was familiar with driving bikes at such speeds as the ex-oil worker competed in Scottish championships. He added: “He has held a licence since the age of 16, which was when he had his only road traffic offence.\n“This was a vehicle which was 20 years old but had a low mileage.\n“It had a running issue as it had been sitting in a garage for eight years and had a rusty fuel tank and gathered dirt.\nRead More Dramatic moment police deliberately ram stolen moped from behind as two riders are thrown onto road “He had stripped it down and had taken it into Inverness to get good fuel and a fuel additive. The vehicle was still spluttering but as he got near Aviemore he felt the issue was starting to clear.\n“He was familiar with this road and knew there was a straight coming up. He was the only vehicle in sight and he did a burst of acceleration over a distance of 1000 feet.\n“He then decelerated down to the speed limit as he approached traffic up ahead.”\n  Comments Show more comments More On Social workers Speeding Motocross Driving test Dangerous driving", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:16:05.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
