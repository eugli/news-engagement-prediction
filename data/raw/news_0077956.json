By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 27, 2017 4:05 PM IAS officers stage a silent protest outside the Bihar Governor’s House against the arrest of BSSC Chairman and their senior colleague Sudhir Kumar in the multi-crore job scam, in Patna on Sunday. (PTI) \nIn an unprecedented gesture of protest against the arrest of Bihar Staff Selection Commission chief and IAS officer Sudhir Kumar, the Bihar branch of IAS Officer’s Association had said that it would not take any verbal orders even from the Chief Minister of the state. \nDays back, Sudhir Kumar and five others were arrested in connection with a paper-leak scam in clerical-grade recruitment examination. The Bihar IAS Officer’s Association, however, came in support of Kumar and called for a CBI inquiry to ensure fair probe on the matter. The arrested BSSC Chairman, who is a 1987 batch IAS officer, was produced in the court of Acting Chief Judicial Magistrate Patna City Khyati Singh who sent him and the others to judicial custody till March 3. Kumar was arrested by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up to probe the paper leak scam. \nAlso Watch: \nExpressing anger over the arrest of its official, the IAS officer’s body stated that it would fight ‘tooth and nail’ against the move and called Kumar ‘the most honest, sincere and competent officer’. The Bihar branch of IAS officers’ Association demanded that the case be transferred to the CBI in the interest of independent inquiry, equity, justice and fair play. \n“The Association is deeply anguished and angered by the manner in which the SIT has arrested the officer… Kumar is one of the finest officers of the cadre and the Association stands by the credentials of the officer,” it said in a statement. \nThe Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the multi-crore employment scam in Bihar has arrested Kumar, the chairman of the Bihar Staff Selection Commission (BSCC), from Hazaribagh in Jharkhand on February 24 for allegedly playing a key role in the scam. The Association has resolved that none of its member would accept posts of chairman of BSCC and other such posts and would not take verbal instruction from higher office including the Chief Minister’s Office, unless given in writing. \n(With inputs from agencies)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:45:19.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
