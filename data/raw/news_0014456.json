Nadarajah. \n“It has been very crowded, many have started to carry the paal kudam (milk pots) and kavadi ,” said Nadarajah. \nLast year, some 1.5 million locals and tourists attended the Thaipu­sam celebration. \nHe advised those who wanted to attend the celebration to take public transport to avoid parking woes. \nThis year, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi is expected to attend the celebrations on Thursday, said Nadarajah. \nDevotees are also advised to dress appropriately for the celebration. \n“Please do not wear revealing sarees. Come in traditional and decent attire. This is a religious festival. Devotees are also not advised to wear expensive jewellery,” he said. \nHis advice comes after a Facebook group warned Hindu women to expect being sprayed with paint should they be “inappropriately dressed” at Thaipusam events. \nThe group’s creator Saravana Rama­senderan was recently char­ged in court with allegedly distur­bing a religious ceremony but has denied the charges. \nNadarajah said that about 2,000 policemen and 750 temple volunteers will be on duty to ensure the safety of devotees attending the ce­lebration this year. \nFor the comfort of devotees, a fourth staircase has been built to ease congestion. Devotees carrying paal kudam will be able to use the first staircase while kavadi bearers use the second staircase. \nNadarajah also advised devotees not to break too many coconuts during the chariot procession. \nHe said the temple will not offer coconut archanai (offering) for prayers at Batu Caves from Feb 7-9 because it would be too time consuming to break the coconut for the prayers. Only banana archanai will be offered. \nNadarajah also said the silver chariot procession will begin at 10pm today from the Sri Maha Mariamman Temple in Jalan Tun H.S Lee, Kuala Lumpur, and is expected to arrive in Batu Caves at 2.30pm tomorrow. \nThe silver chariot will make its way back from Batu Caves at 4pm on Feb 10 and is expected to reach the Sri Maha Mariamman Temple at 2am on Feb 11.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:14:29.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
