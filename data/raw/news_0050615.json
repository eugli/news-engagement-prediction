Show more By Peter Reuell, Harvard Staff Writer \nF or most college freshmen, working in a lab typically means following the step-by-step instructions of class assignments with the goal of performing a specific experiment to produce a predetermined result. \nBut a handful of Harvard freshmen got the chance to experience real lab work by exploring how altering genes in yeast affected the cells’ functions. \nCreated by postdoctoral fellow James Martenson and Vlad Denic, a professor of molecular and cellular biology, the Wintersession class was designed to give undergraduates an up-close-and-personal view of the research that takes place in Harvard labs, and the opportunities they have to take part. \n“Students often aren’t aware these opportunities exist, so we think of this as a gateway for freshmen interested in doing research,” Martenson said. “But we also wanted to emphasize some of the critical thinking skills we use every day as scientists, but which may not be emphasized as much in more traditional coursework.” \nOver the course of the multiday class, each student worked with genetically altered strains of yeast to perform a series of three experiments. \n“We chose yeast because it’s a classic model organism in biology,” Martenson said. “A lot of very important work has been done in yeast. In fact, much of what we know about basic cell biology we’ve learned from yeast.” Freshmen Jessica Diaz (left) and William Gao await results with rapt attention.

This has solidified my desire to pursue the Ph.D. part of an M.D./Ph.D, and even though it’s very serious science, it’s relaxing.” \nFor Amanda DiMartini, the class was a chance for an in-depth look at a field she’s considering as a concentration. \n“I did some research in high school, but it was relatively simple,” she said. “I’m interested in concentrating in some area of biology … and this was a chance to see if I want to continue doing research throughout college. I feel like, in this class, we’re learning to think scientifically, and to think critically, and how to do research at a higher level. I don’t regret [this class] at all.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:56:57.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
