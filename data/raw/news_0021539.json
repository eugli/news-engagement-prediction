As it stands, the company has roughly 70 employees, about half of which are veterans. \n“It is a lofty goal,” he said. \nMr. Schultz promised Starbucks ‘ own hiring blitz two days after Mr. Trump signed an order halting visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries — Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya and Yemen — for 90 days, and halting the American refugee program for 120 days. \nHe also offered support for young “Dreamers” who were brought to the country illegally by their parents. And he reiterated the company’s commitment to connecting employees with health coverage, as congressional Republicans mull ways to repeal Obamacare. \nThe memo did give a nod to the armed forces, saying the refugee effort will start “here in the U.S. by making the initial focus of our hiring efforts on those individuals who have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel in the various countries where our military has asked for such support.” \nMr. Hafer applauded the sentiment but said it would be “pretty difficult” to assess who lent the U.S. a hand on the battlefield. \n“Are you going to take their word for it?” he said. “I know how to get a veteran. That is an easy thing to vet.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:37:56.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
