The 21-year-old then took home the first trophy of his NBA career and wrapped up a successful All-Star weekend. \n“It does feel good to win no matter what,” Porzingis said.

(Ronald Martinez/Getty Images) \nIt’s been a rough couple months for the reeling Knicks and Porzingis, whose production has tapered after dealing with Achilles soreness. But on Saturday, he toppled DeMarcus Cousins, Nikola Jokic and Hayward in the Skills Challenge – which combines dribbling, passing and shooting in a race setting. \nHe became the first Knick to win the 15-year-old Skills Challenge, and the second straight big man after Karl Anthony-Towns took the title last year. Before that, the winners were either all point guards or Dwyane Wade. \n“It's a good feeling that I'm able to showcase my skill with my size and show to the kids that you're capable of doing that even if you're tall and lanky like me,” said Porzingis, who also was part of the winning team in the Rising Stars Challenge on Friday. “I think a lot of kids now growing up will improve those perimeter skills just seeing guys like -- I don't want to mention myself, but big guys with perimeter skills that can do it.” \nPorzingis completed the pass through the hoop on the first try of all three of his runs. On the final run against Hayward, he also buried the 3-pointer on his first attempt. \n“Before we started doing it, while I was doing the walk through, I knew that the pass and the shot on the three-pointer was the most important parts of that,” Porzingis said. “And I was able to make the pass on the first try all three times. And then in the final, that last shot just went in. So just a little bit of luck.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:21:38.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
