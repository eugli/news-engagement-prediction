He (Raj Kapoor) was surprised to see me in the look of Rupa (referring to the test look she took). He appreciated my passion towards the character, gave me gold coins and singed me for the film,” the actress said. \nMore from the world of Entertainment: \n\nWhen Zeenat and Kapoor were shooting for Vakil Babu, the filmmaker was writing the script of “Satyam Shivam Sundaram” during their shoot breaks, and he would often talk about the movie to her, specially Rupa’s character. \n“Raj ji used to talk very passionately and intensely about Rupa’s character. He would often tell me about how Rupa would do certain things and those conversations made me extremely curious. Gradually I felt like I wanted to be Rupa,” the 65-year-old actress said. \nAlso read | Feroz Khan taught Zeenat Aman never to be late on sets \nOne day, after finishing her shoot, Zeenat decided to get into the role of Rupa.

She did whatever she could, to present her interpretation of Rupa. \nWhen she went to meet Kapoor, she was stopped at the door and asked who she was, and the model-actress said ‘Raj ji se kehna Rupa aayi hai’ (tell Raj that Rupa has come). \nIn the TV show, to be aired on Zee Classic on Saturday, the “Hare Rama Hare Krishna” actress also talks about her journey as an actress, her career and co-stars. \n“My Life My Story” is a weekly chat show that takes the viewers up, close and personal with the legends of Hindi cinema.
