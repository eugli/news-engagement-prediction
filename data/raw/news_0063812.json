Customers will also be able to ask questions about fees or where to find the closest ATM. \n“We’re aiming to transform banking,” Gamage said. “We aim to deliver service to customers where, when and how they want. Obviously, nowadays a lot of customers are spending a lot of time on social media and places such as Facebook Messenger.” \nThe developers took steps to ensure security and privacy, like only allowing payment transactions with recipients already selected through online banking. \n“As a bank, we’re very focused on customer security and the security of our customer data,” Gamage said. “We explain the importance of them not sharing their Facebook Messenger credentials. We also explain the importance of them password-locking their phones. But also, we have authentication and security built into the application and, actually, the functionally we’ve limited so it’s only doing safe banking transactions to existing bill payees, for example.” \nATB and Finn.ai are working on making this style of “chat banking” available on other platforms as well, like SMS and WhatsApp. \nIt also hopes to add features that will let clients ask how much they’ve spent on gas this month or find out what’s left in their clothing budget. \n“We want our customers to be able to make transactions on their terms, the way they want to bank,” said Wellington Holbrook, ATB’s chief transformation officer. \n“The days of banks dictating to customers how and when they can do business are behind us.” \n“The future of banking is conversational, with customers interacting with intelligent bots to support their banking needs,” said Finn.ai co-founder and COO, Nat Cartwright. “Finn.ai is working hand-in-hand with ATB to ensure customers receive these benefits quickly and seamlessly.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:56:34.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
