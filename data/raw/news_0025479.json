The actor's credits include Sneaky Pete, Army Wives and Rescue Me. He is repped by Don Buchwald and Associates. \nPancholy will portray Dr. Nambue, the chief medical officer of the Starship Shenzhou. Best known for his roles on 30 Rock and Weeds, the actor is repped by Gersh, Brillstein Entertainment Partners and Gang Tyre. \nVartholomeos rounds out the trio as Ensign Connor, a junior officer in Starfleet Academy who is assigned to Starship Shenzhou. The actor's credits include The Following and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. \nThe three actors join a cast that includes Sonequa Martin-Green, Doug Jones, Michelle Yeoh, Anthony Rapp, James Frain, Chris Obi, Shazad Latif and Mary Chieffo. \nThe new reboot features the franchise's Enterprise, now known as the U.S.S. Discovery. The drama will introduce new characters seeking new worlds and civilizations while exploring the dramatic contemporary themes that have been a signature of the franchise since its inception in 1966. \nOriginally slated to premiere in January as CBS All Access' first original scripted series, the project has been delayed several times, most notably due to the departure of Bryan Fuller as showrunner. He still remains an exec producer on Star Trek: Discovery, along with Alex Kurtzman, Heather Kadin, Gretchen J. Berg, Aaron Harberts, Akiva Goldsman, Rod Roddenberry and Trevor Roth. \nBerg and Harberts took over as showrunners for Fuller, who recently noted that he will not be involved at all but has left his outline for the series as well as multiple scripts for producers. \nStar Trek: Discovery still does not have a premiere date. CBS All Access is getting ready to launch its first scripted original, The Good Fight, on Sunday.
