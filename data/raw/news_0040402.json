Adam Ant aka Stuart Leslie Goddard has had one of the most illustrious careers of the post punk, fantasy-oriented New Romantic movement of the early 1980s. His career changing album, Kings of the Wild Frontier was released in 1980. During this tour, the album is being performed in its entirety along with other Ant fan favorites. \nThe evening started with a raucous set by an all girl band, Glam Skanks, a glitter-rock band. This LA-based band has opened shows for Alice Cooper and they have jammed with Marilyn Manson, Johnny Depp and Joe Perry of Aerosmith. Members AliCat on lead vocals, Flyin’ V on lead guitar, Breanna Blue on bass, and Linzy Jewlz on drums held nothing back during their set and they are an absolute rush to watch live. With their heavy glittery makeup and their second-hand store duds, they were a perfect opening act for the main talent. \nFinally, it was time for Adam Ant to take the stage. He jumped on the stage wearing his famous Napoleonic headgear and hussar jacket, then he immediately started the set with “Dog Eat Dog” and the ravenous fans were wild. He is the master of striking a pose and giving new meaning to performance swagger. \nThe band consisted of Andy Woodard and Jola on drums, William Crewdson on guitar and Joe Holweger on bass guitar. Adams classic twin drummers brought home the thunderous beats and percussion they executed the show masterfully anticipating Adam’s every move. \nThe crowd in the room was of multi-generations. Many were in full makeup and dressed with Adam’s headgear for the occasion. Heads were bobbing and feet were moving so ferociously that the venue seemed to vibrate. \nAdam moved from one song to the next without much banter, yet he seemed to interact with the crowd. His voice was crisp and melodic. There was a two-song encore that included Marc Bolan’s “Get It On.” This was an epic night from an artist who gives everything he has. He elevated the fans to new heights.
