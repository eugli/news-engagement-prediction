Officers are expected to act in a professional manner. \n\"We strongly refute any allegation that officers are instructed to act outside of these requirements. Where we find employees have not acted as they should we act appropriately.\" \nA spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, said the BBC was right to launch an investigation and it would be speaking to the corporation directly about the accusations. \nDamian Collins, Conservative MP and chairman of the Commons culture committee, told the Daily Mail: \"It's very concerning. This is being done in the BBC's name. \n\"The BBC needs to make sure changes are made to the way this contract is being run or that it's taken away from Capita and given to someone else.\" \nLabour MP Chris Matheson, who also sits on the committee, called for Capita bosses to be summoned to Parliament. Efforts to pay \nIn 2015, 166,000 people were fined for licence fee evasion. The maximum penalty for watching BBC channels or iPlayer without a licence is £1,000. \nMore than one million offenders go through magistrates court in England and Wales every year for evading the payment. \nIn January, new sentencing guidelines were introduced meaning magistrates can impose a non-financial penalty, known as a conditional discharge, so the person will not be sentenced unless they commit another offence. \nThis will only be used in cases where people have made significant efforts to pay the fee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:07:48.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
