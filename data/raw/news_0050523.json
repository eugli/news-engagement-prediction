Jacob Tamme (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 4:59 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 4:59 p.m. ET \nJacob Tamme doesn't want to leave Atlanta, but he knows the choice isn't completely his. \nThe Falcons tight end is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent in March, and he could possibly take a chance with the floundering 49ers under new head coach Kyle Shanahan, Tamme's offensive coordinator in Atlanta. \nMORE: Dolphins give Cameron Wake new two-year deal \n\"I love being a Falcon, love my teammates, love what we have going on here in this organization,\" Tamme told ESPN.com . \"I’m interested to see what the future holds.\" \nFalcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff said the team's main priority after the Super Bowl was to zero in on keeping its free agents, but it's unclear if the organization is willing to retain the 32-year-old. If that's the case, ESPN reported Shanahan would love to have Tamme in San Francisco. \nTamme, who was signed to a two-year, $2.9 million deal with the Falcons, could be a huge piece in turning around the 49ers offense under Shanahan. \nTamme wasn't on the field during the Falcons' Super Bowl loss since he was recovering from a season-ending right shoulder injury he sustained in Week 8. He was told the injury could take roughly six months to heal, which would put him in prime position to be ready for summer practices. \nHe was the Falcons' leading receiver during the first three games of the season with 14 catches for 154 yards and a touchdown and showed great chemistry with quarterback Matt Ryan until he was hurt. \n\"I’m rocking and rolling with rehab and it’s going great,\" he said. \"I feel like I could play in a month. ...
