L.L.Bean found itself in the spotlight Thursday after the president-elect formally endorsed the Maine apparel company. by Twitter By Ian McNicol/Getty Images. Early on Thursday morning, President-elect Donald Trump tweeted out his support of L.L.Bean, the Maine-based outdoors company known for duck boots and monogrammed backpacks founded in 1912. “Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean. @LBPerfectMaine,” he wrote. \nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/819541997325316096 Though it’s hard to discern why the president-elect tweets when he does, this particular missive seemed to begin with a story published nearly a week prior by the Associated Press , which reported that the Federal Election Commission had accused Linda Bean, a partial owner and board member of the company, of making excessive contributions to the Making America Great Again LLC, a political action committee in support of Trump (in case the tagline didn’t make that clear). Bean, 75, is the granddaughter of Leon Leonwood Bean, the company’s founder. The M.A.G.A. PAC was limited to individual contributions of $5,000, but she was alleged to have contributed $60,000 to it. She disputed the claim that she donated an illegal sum on Fox & Friends on Thursday morning and said she had only donated $25,000. That is still $20,000 over the limit. His tweet came shortly after her segment aired. Bean’s appearance on the conservative talk show was largely in response to “bullies,” in her words, who were boycotting L.L. Bean after her support for Trump came to light. #GrabYourWallet —an 8,000-member Facebook group that tracks companies with Trump associations for consumers seeking to boycott them—placed L.L.Bean on the “additional entities to consider boycotting” section of its list. That subset includes brands that don’t have a direct business relationship with the family, but have leadership that has come out in support of the president-elect. “My sense of the people who are participating in #GrabYourWallet is that they are looking for a way to feel some control right now, and they're very willing to flex their economic power in favor of a more respectful and inclusive society,” said Shannon Coulter , who co-founded the list in October after leaked Access Hollywood tapes showed Trump bragging and laughing about sexual assault. “I don't get the sense that there's this desire to punish in a political or partisan way at all . . . I see my role as providing information and to help people make their own decision.” Incoming presidents (and sitting ones) have traditionally refrained from directly telling people to buy anything. In fact, federal law bans executive-branch employees from making product endorsements, as The New York Times points out. The president is exempt from the law, but it still doesn’t look good. But all that might be getting ahead of things. L.L.Bean, it seems, would not welcome the endorsement of a polarizing president-elect with an approval rating in serious danger of bottoming out on the curb on his way into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The company responded to its #GrabYourWallet designation by pinning a tweet from January 9 that linked to a Facebook post from its executive chairman, Shawn Gorman . (The company did not respond to a request for comment for this story.) \nWe fully acknowledge and respect that some may disagree with the political views of a single member of our 10-person board of directors. Like most large families, the more than 50 family member-owners of the business hold views and embrace causes across the political spectrum, just as our employees and customers do. And as every member of the family would agree, no individual alone speaks on behalf of the business or represents the values of the company that L.L. built. With this in mind, we are deeply troubled by the portrayal of L.L.Bean as a supporter of any political agenda. L.L.Bean does not endorse political candidates, take positions on political matters, or make political contributions. Simply put, we stay out of politics. To be included in this boycott campaign is simply misguided, and we respectfully request that Grab Your Wallet reverse its position. So add unwanted endorsements to the ballooning list of extraordinary elements of the coming administration. And it’s possible that Trump’s specific name-check of L.L.Bean last week could augur more to come. He’s demonstrated a clear willingness to call out corporations by name, putting everyone from auto to airplane manufacturers on public notice since the election. So what’s a brand to do when the most powerful man in the country shouts you out—and you don’t want him to? Erik Bernstein of Bernstein Crisis Management says that unwanted endorsements happen all the time. He advises companies to ignore them because it's usually understood as an individual opinion, he said in an e-mail. Trump, however, is working within atypical circumstances thanks to what Bernstein called “the president's real and perceived power to influence policy.” Customers will pay attention when he endorses a product because he could potentially use his position of power to prop up or destroy a business. How a company deals with it depends on how closely the stakeholders’ values align with the POETUS, but every company, Bernstein said, should take a hard look at how it would handle a Trump tweet, either for or against the brand. RoseMarie Terenzio , a crisis-management expert at the public-affairs firm Kivvit, elaborated on that point Friday, saying brands should “be ready.” “You can't sit in a room anymore with executives and try to hammer out a response that needs tons of approval and takes a long time. The new game is rapid response,” Terenzio said. Terenzio said that brief is always better. She cited Skittles response to the controversy it saw after Donald Trump Jr. used its products in a charged political metaphor about Muslim refugees. The brand disassociated itself from the controversy in a three-sentence statement. “Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy,\" a spokesperson from Wrigley, Skittles’ parent company, wrote. “A quick, concise response is always the best way to go,” she said. “We live in a different world. People want a soundbite, not four paragraphs.” It’s something the Trump brand learned long ago. Correction: An earlier version of this article had the incorrect timeline for L.L. Bean being added to the #GrabYourWallet list. It was included on January 6 .
