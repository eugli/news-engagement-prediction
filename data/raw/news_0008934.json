Reacting Sena leader Sanjay Raut's reported statement made today that Fadnavis government was serving a notice period, the CM said \"We don't work on notice. Those who are putting us on notice are not taken seriously in their own party and we too don't take them seriously.\" \"My government is strong and will last for the full five years. We are in alliance with Shiv Sena in the state, but we will not require their support in the BMC and we will win comfortably,\" Fadnavis said in an interaction with city journalists organised by the Mumbai Hindi Patrakar Sangh. He said that BJP had differences with Shiv Sena over the style of functioning (of the BMC), \"we wanted to set the development agenda first, and not the number of seats to be contested by both the parties. However, Sena rejected our development agenda and told us that they will not give us more than 60 seats.\" \nThe CM said in the Assembly polls of 2014, we showed them our capabilities and therefore, we will not require Shiv Sena support in BMC.
