JUST WATCHED What is Trump's path forward with the CBC? 09:47 Story highlights Sophia A. Nelson: President Donald Trump has thus far failed to make inroads in the African-American community But if Trump can build critical relationships with black leaders and constituents, he can make great strides in bridging the racial divide Sophia A. Nelson is an award-winning author and journalist and former House GOP committee counsel from 1997-1999. She is the author of the new book, \"E Pluribus One: Rediscovering Our Founders' Vision for a United America.\" The views expressed in this commentary are her own. (CNN) On Tuesday, President Donald Trump honored Black History Month by visiting the newly-minted National Museum of African American History and Culture. Amid the fanfare and praise that Trump's visit was \" a step in the right direction ,\" one question still remains: Is he serious about fixing the racial divide in this country? With a rise in anti-Semitic and racist incidents since the November election, the President has come under increasing pressure to respond. And given Trump's comments on the sorry state of black America, he should feel an urgency to act. On the campaign trail, Trump often invoked the phrase \" living in hell ,\" when describing US inner cities and the poverty and gun violence that often plagues black communities in them. Sophia A. Nelson And upon taking office last month, the President threatened Chicago officials on Twitter , declaring that \"If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!\" Now 30 days into the new Trump administration, where is he with black Americans, and where does he need to go? Let me start by saying I do not think Trump is a racist. I think he is ignorant when it comes to people of color, their experiences and how to properly engage with them. That ignorance was on full display earlier this month when he seemed not to know who Frederick Douglass was, and then, during his Feb. 16 press conference at the White House, had a shocking and awkward nationally televised exchange with veteran White House reporter April Ryan. Read More Ryan asked the President a question about his promise to improve urban communities. He praised her question as \"very professional and very good,\" and when she followed up with another question on whether he planned to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus, he replied: \"Do you want to set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours?\" JUST WATCHED ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:52:49.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
