The biggest shock came when the Pelicans completed a blockbuster trade for DeMarcus Cousins hours after the All-Star Game. The deal — which sent Buddy Hield , Tyreke Evans , Langston Galloway , a first-round pick, and a second-round pick to Sacramento — came seemingly out of nowhere and followed months of the Kings publicly denying interest in trading Cousins. In the days before the All-Star break, the Kings explored the market and found it to be more tepid than expected. Yet they took the Pelicans’ offer anyway, deciding they already traveled too far down the road of trading Cousins to turn back now. It remains to be seen if the Cousins deal leads to other major trades. It looks like Jimmy Butler and Carmelo Anthony will stay put, but a lot can change in the final hours before the deadline. Here’s every trade that’s occurred, followed by every NBA trade rumor you need to know.
