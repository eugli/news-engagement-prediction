How so, you ask? The brand is testing out an eyeshadow palette called exactly that backstage this season, and it's making us think that maybe it's time we all got comfortable with the term—and furry shoes —again. Because the versatile colors in the palette really do hit a certain spot in your makeup bag. And Frappuccinos are delicious. \nThe kit, spotted on MAC senior artist Netta Szekely's Instagram feed, contains nine neutral tones named Shy Girl, Tattle-Tale, Me Me Me, Hell in Heels, Mr. Personality, Big White Lie, Text Me Later, Gameplayer, and Love This Bitch!. It's a sea of beiges, taupes, grays, and plums—the basis for any good \"not quite nude\" eye. \nWhen we reached out to MAC for details (and specifically to ask if \"Basic Bitch\" was for-sure going to be the palette's name since obviously we will need it in that case), reps would only give us two: That the palette is being tested this fashion month and that it's being considered for a Spring/Summer launch this year.
