It needs no introduction. Apple works with professional photographers, around the world, to show off what its new iPhones can do vis-a-vis camera capabilities. The iPhone 7 was similarly taken on a ride - globally -- in November last year and the results were nothing short of phenomenal. \nApple asked various photographers around the world, from Shanghai to South Africa, to capture some photos during the same night. On November 5, 2016, they all grabbed an iPhone 7, their accessories and captured some great shots, the company noted. \nHoardings carrying the pictures shot by these photographers can now be spotted at various locations around the world. The campaign has meanwhile, just gone live in India across Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. \nApple seemingly believes that it's quite a powerful campaign and focuses on the low light photographic capabilities of the iPhone 7 Plus.The company claims that F/1.8 aperture is large aperture and allows up to 50 per cent more light onto the camera sensor than iPhone 6s, enhancing the camera's ability to take low-light photos. Then there is the new six-element lens, which, according to company, delivers brighter, more detailed shots. \nApple has incorporated Optical Image Stabilisation in the iPhone 7 while the iPhone 7 Plus comes with dual cameras on the rear, a first for the company in question. \nThe iPhone 7 comes with a 12-megapxiel camera on the rear with f/1.8 aperture, OIS and 4 LEDs. The rear sensor is 20 per cent more energy efficient, says Apple. Live photos are supported, so are RAW image files. On the front, there is a 7-megapixel camera, up from the 5-megapixel sensor on-board the previous versions. \nThe dual camera setup in the iPhone 7 Plus meanwhile consists of two 12-megapixel cameras: one consisting of a wide-angle lens while another with a telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 Plus with its twin cameras can take pretty impressive photos with shallow depth of field, or bokeh, according to Apple.
