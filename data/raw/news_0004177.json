It gives me the chance to undermine the inquiry from within. It is a macabre show trial Daniel Janner QC \nL ord Janner , who died in December 2015, is accused of abusing boys in children’s homes in Leicestershire where he was an MP. \nHis children have branded the inquiry into their father a witch hunt, pointing out he was never convicted in his lifetime and that now he is dead he cannot defend his reputation. \nThey also point out that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) was set up to investigate institutional abuse and that Lord Janner is the only individual who has merited an investigation strand of his own. \nWelcoming the decision, his son Daniel Janner QC said: “It gives me the chance to undermine the inquiry from within. It is a macabre show trial.” \nMr Janner added: “Our Core Participant status does not legitimise an utterly disgraceful and unjust process.

In those circumstances, I am satisfied that all three applicants are entitled to core participant status in that capacity.” \nIICSA has suffered a series of high profile resignations and is beset by delays. It is likely to run for at least a decade and cost more than £100 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:13:00.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
