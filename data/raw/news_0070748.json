The September 2008 order specifies that telcos must disclose details of promotional offers, which in any case shouldn’t exceed 90 days. Bharti Airtel had also challenged the legality of Jio’s free calls. \n\nIt had filed a petition with the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal contending that the interconnection usage charge of 14 paise per minute was a floor price below which operators couldn’t provide voice calls. The charge is paid to networks that receive calls.The commission highlighted that with free services till December 31, Jio had effectively violated the 90-day cap on promotional offers. \n\n\"Reliance Jio Infocomm commenced services from September 5, 2016, and offered a promotional tariff up to December 31, 2016, which was beyond 90 days,\" it said. According to the note, lower revenue will affect telecom operators, which owe over Rs 1 lakh crore to the government as deferred payment for spectrum and close to Rs 4 lakh crore to banks. \n\n\"If the falling trend continues, it will impact the payment and the investment capacity of the industry. In those circumstances, the possibility of defaulting on repayment of loan and instalment of deferred payment for acquisition of spectrum in earlier auctions cannot be ruled out,\" the note says.
