It looks better than ever,\" he said.\nListon needs the walker to move his legs. It had been missing for more than 24 hours.\n'It's like taking away my legs.' \n- Brandon Liston It was taken from the end of the driveway where Liston gets dropped off by the bus.\n\"What we've been doing is putting the walker and a sled at the top of the driveway so I can get down the driveway and into the house,\" Liston said.\nListon slides down the driveway in the sled and then uses the walker to get in the house.\nWalker taken on Tuesday But on Tuesday afternoon, the walker was put out earlier than usual.\nBy the time Liston got off the bus, it was gone. His life is far more complicated without it, he said.\n\"I use this walker every day, this walker is my life,\" he said. \"It's like taking away my legs.\n\"Even just to brush my teeth, I had to get help into the bathroom because my wheelchair wouldn't fit. So it's a big loss of independence. I can't walk about the house, I can't get my stuff when I need it, I can't get out to the dinner table to eat supper.\"\nTo replace the walker would have cost $1,800 and could have taken several weeks to arrive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:23:49.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
