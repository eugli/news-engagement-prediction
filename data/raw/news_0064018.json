Once at full capacity, Musk’s 13 million square foot facility, would split production between Tesla Energy storage products, and battery packs for Tesla vehicles. The plant would triple the worldwide production of li-ion batteries once it hit its stride. \nTo start, Tesla vehicle batteries are expected to account for two-thirds of the production. Over time, though, Musk believes “with a high degree of certainty” that Tesla energy products would generate similar revenue. \nLuckily, Musk will have space for the increased output. Company representatives today said they were finalizing locations for two additional Gigafactories, potentially three to join Gigafactory 1, and a solar plant in Buffalo (acquired in the SolarCity deal). \nThere’s nothing firm on the location for the next plant, but Musk said it could be somewhere in Europe and that the company will decide on a location this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:36:13.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
