Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nThe midfielder, whose performances in the Belgian First Division led to an international call-up last year, has been tracked by a host of Premier League clubs. \nJose Mourinho was reportedly in contact with the wonderkid last summer regarding a switch to Old Trafford, while Chelsea and Tottenham have also been liked with a move. \nBut Claesen, who spent two years at Spurs in the 1980s, believes Arsenal would be an ideal club for Tielemans. \n‘Succeeding in the Premier League is something different to excelling in Belgium,’ Claesen, 54, told Het Laatste Nieuws. \n‘I think of efficiency in the adaptation, because he needs to work on. Arsenal fixtures \nLiverpool (A) – Sat 4 Mar Bayern Munich – Champions League (H) – Tue 7 Mar Lincoln – FA Cup (H) – 11/12 Mar West Brom (A) – Sat 18 Mar Manchester City (H) – Sat 1 Apr West Ham (H) – Tue 4 Apr Crystal Palace (A) – Sat 8 Apr \n‘And can he compete? At Anderlecht, everything has always been relatively easy for him. In England he must start from scratch and learn to fight.
