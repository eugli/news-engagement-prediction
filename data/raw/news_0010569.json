The scene has inspired several remixes where other songs are played over his dance. Origin \nThe scene comes from the 22nd episode of The Simpson ’s fifth season, Secrets of a Successful Marriage , first aired in May 19th, 1994. [1] In the episode, Homer goes to an adult education center and peeks on a class of “Funk Dancing for Self-Defense” hosted by Moe. After doing some dance moves, Moe grabs a shotgun and fires several times. Spread \nThe earliest known video to remix the footage was posted to Vine on February 28th, 2015, by RandomDude_VoiceOverKing, [2] who paired the footage with a song by A$AP Ferg. Two weeks later, Lewis McKee uploaded the first known YouTube remix, pairing the footage with music by Zaza-Garmiani (shown below). \nThe remixes did not begin growing particularly popular until the summer of 2016, following a video by Andru Ludwingt Lira Rodriguez posted on July 14th that paired the footage to a Bridge and Law remix of the song Pumped Up Kicks by Foster the People. The video gained over 317,000 views. \nAfter Rodriguez’ remix, dozens more remixes began appearing on YouTube that paired the footage with different tracks, including You Reposted In the Wrong Neighborhood .
