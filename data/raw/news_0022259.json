He still has no idea where it is, and there are several teams on the case. The lieutenant governor enlisted the Texas Rangers to search for the missing jersey in addition to the Houston Police Department, proving just how high of a priority this is. \nOr maybe it’s not. \nHouston Police Chief Art Acevedo, who was in charge of overseeing Super Bowl LI, commented on the situation Tuesday, saying it’s not exactly concern No. 1 in the Houston PD. “It might be the highest priority for [the] lieutenant governor, I can tell you we had three homicides the night of the Super Bowl in the city of Houston, and we’d like to find it, but I don’t think we’re burning the midnight oil worrying about a jersey.” Acevedo said . “It’s just not the biggest, greatest importance in the big scheme of things.” \nThat’s certainly fair. Brady and the Patriots obviously want to find the jersey, but it shouldn’t jeopardize the safety of others by prioritizing it over other crimes in the area. \nHe told his staff the same thing. “I told those guys, ‘Hey guys, we’ll give it a run, but let’s keep things in perspective, it’s a jersey,’” Acevedo said. \nAcevedo did point out that the police department doesn’t monitor the locker room, or handle any security measures inside the confines of it. That falls on the NFL, Acevedo said, which recuses them from any possible lapses in security.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:26:20.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
