Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nEating out is expensive at the best of times, let alone when you're paying for a host of other activities over half term. \nThankfully there are some places trying to give the parents a bit of help over the school break by letting the kids eat for FREE. \nWhile some offer a free children's main for every adult meal, others are giving little ones the whole shebang - with a drink and dessert thrown in. \nWith some schools off from February 13 to 17 and the majority off the following week, dates of offers vary so please check before booking. Bella Italia \nChildren can get a free three-course Piccolo or Grande meal with the purchase of every adult main meal at Bella Italia restaurants. \nThe Piccolo mains are aimed at children aged two to six years, with the Grande for seven to 11-year-olds. \nDishes range from pizza and pasta options to burgers, chicken strips and pizza dogs - hot dogs with mozzarella and tomato sauce baked in pizza dough. \nThe kids eat free offer runs from February 10 to March 31 and the menu now features a limited edition Wimpy Kid Gelato sundae after Bella teamed up with the publisher to celebrate the paperback launch of Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Old School. \nYou must sign up to the Bella Italia Club here to redeem the offer. \nThe award-winning menu also includes drinks with free refills on squash giving families even better value for money. \nThis includes both still or fizzy water, a wide range of flavours and rather funky straws which the kids get to take home. \nFor the babies on board the restaurants serve Ella's Kitchen pouches for £1.50, with carrots, apples and parsnips for stage one and chicken casserole for stage two. \nDesserts to choose from include cookie dough cake with ice cream and choccie brownies. \nTo find your nearest Bella Italia, including restaurants at Salford Quays and Manchester Arndale, visit the website here . Jamie's Italian \nJamie Oliver is continuing with the offer he first launched last summer and letting kids eat for free at his Jamie's Italian in King Street. \nFrom February 11 to 26, for every main course you order, one of your children can enjoy a meal on them. \nYoung diners can choose between six dishes and also enjoy a 'shake me' salad, drink and dessert on the house. \nChildren must be 12 or under and be accompanied by an adult, purchasing a main meal. \nJamie's Italian, 100 King St, Manchester, M2 4WU.

Pier Eight Restaurant and Bar, The Lowry \nThe kids eat free offer runs at The Lowry's Pier Eight Restaurant when any family performance is on. \nFor every adult that dines the venue is offering a free children's meal. And it will match each course like for like, so if you get pudding, they'll get one too. What more reason do you need to devour a dessert? \nThe kids menu includes starters of garlic bread, soup, or salad and mains of sausages and mash, tomato pasta and fish fingers and chips. \nFor dessert they can choose from yoghurt and apple slices, jam sponge and custard or ice cream. \nLowry-themed colouring and activity sheets are on hand to keep the little people busy while you wait. \nThe offer, which doesn't include sides and drinks, is on throughout half term and whenever there is a children’s performance. \nPier Eight, Salford Quays, M50 3AZ.
