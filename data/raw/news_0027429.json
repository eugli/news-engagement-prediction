(AP) \nPlayboy magazine is returning to its roots, bringing nudes back just a year after abandoning full frontal shots of women saying they had become outdated. \nUnder the headline “Naked is Normal,” the magazine will bring nude pictorials back in its March/April edition, the company said on Monday. \n“I’ll be the first to admit that the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated, but nudity was never the problem because nudity isn’t a problem,” Playboy’s chief creative officer Cooper Hefner said in a statement on the magazine’s website.

(AP) \nThe famed Playboy Mansion near Los Angeles, Hugh Hefner’s home and the venue for his lavish, hedonistic parties in the 1960s and 70s, was sold for $100 million in August in a deal that allowed Hefner, 90, to continue living there for the remainder of his life. \nFollow @htshowbiz for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:33:37.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
