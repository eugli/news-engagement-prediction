It only took a few steps for her to do this — 41, in fact, so simple! — and if you follow the program, you too can see results at your own workplace. \nSusan Fowler worked for the ride-hailing company in 2015, and on Sunday dropped a 2800-word blog post on her personal website detailing allegations of instance after instance of 1960s-style behavior by management and HR at Uber. \nThe post, Reflecting On One Very, Very Strange Year At Uber , forced Uber's CEO Travis Kalanick to launch an \" urgent investigation \" into the allegations. Rebecca Ruiz [5:17 PM] \nYet, if you take a look at how many hoops Fowler had to jump through to even get Uber to pay attention to her complaints in the first place, it becomes very clear that there was nothing \"urgent\" about her situation until the public heard about it. \nHerewith, a listing of every single damn time Uber ignored Fowler's alleged attempts to tell management about the inappropriate behavior. For your convenience, we've scoured her experiences to provide you, dear readers, with a handy, 41-step guide on how to navigate hideous, belittling and sexist behavior at the office. \nIt's so easy, you won't believe it! (Note: You have to complete all 41 steps for this to work.) STEP 1. When your boss insinuates he wants to have sex with you in work chat messages, first try reporting him. \n\"On my first official day rotating on the team, my new manager sent me a string of messages over company chat. He was in an open relationship he said, and his girlfriend was having an easy time finding new partners but he wasn't. He was trying to stay out of trouble at work, he said, but he couldn't help getting in trouble, because he was looking for women to have sex with. It was clear that he was trying to get me to have sex with him, and it was so clearly out of line that I immediately took screenshots of these chat messages and reported him to HR.\" STEP 2. When HR tells you it's his first offense, fine. Just wait until he does it again. \n\"When I reported the situation, I was told by both HR and upper management that even though this was clearly sexual harassment and he was propositioning me, it was this man's first offense, and that they wouldn't feel comfortable giving him anything other than a warning and a stern talking-to.\" STEP 3. Understand when your boss propositions you for sex, it is just an innocent mistake. \n\"Upper management told me that he 'was a high performer' (i.e. had stellar performance reviews from his superiors) and they wouldn't feel comfortable punishing him for what was probably just an innocent mistake on his part.\" STEP 4. Don't expect your boss to improve, and don't expect HR to be of any real help. \n\"I was then told that I had to make a choice: (i) I could either go and find another team and then never have to interact with this man again, or (ii) I could stay on the team, but I would have to understand that he would most likely give me a poor performance review when review time came around, and there was nothing they could do about that.\" STEP 5. Understand you will get a bad review if you stay on the team. \n\"One HR rep even explicitly told me that it wouldn't be retaliation if I received a negative review later because I had been 'given an option'.\" STEP 6. Escalate the issue even though it won't get you anywhere. Remember: This is his first offense. \n\"I tried to escalate the situation but got nowhere with either HR or with my own management chain (who continued to insist that they had given him a stern-talking to and didn't want to ruin his career over his 'first offense').\" STEP 7. When things get really bad, O.K., fine, leave the team. \n\"So I left that team.\" STEP 8. HR will become your enemy and you should deal with this alone in a darkened room. \n\"(I desperately wanted to not have to interact with HR ever again).\" STEP 9. Ignore the nightmare that has become your life and be a rock star on your new team. \n\"I ended up joining a brand-new SRE team that gave me a lot of autonomy, and I found ways to be happy and do amazing work. In fact, the work I did on this team turned into the production-readiness process which I wrote about in my bestselling (!!!) book Production-Ready Microservices.\" STEP 10. Back to that sex harassment thing: To back up your claims, find other women with similar stories. \n\"Some of the women even had stories about reporting the exact same manager I had reported, and had reported inappropriate interactions with him long before I had even joined the company.\" STEP 11. If HR and management ignore the stories of all these women, don't lose hope. Working in an office is tough. \n\"It became obvious that both HR and management had been lying about this being 'his first offense', and it certainly wasn't his last.\" STEP 12. Hope for someone else to report the same man, and if/when this does indeed happen, remain patient. \n\"Within a few months, he was reported once again for inappropriate behavior, and those who reported him were told it was still his 'first offense'. The situation was escalated as far up the chain as it could be escalated, and still nothing was done.\" STEP 13. Gather all the women in your office and schedule meetings with HR. \n\"Myself and a few of the women who had reported him in the past decided to all schedule meetings with HR to insist that something be done. In my meeting, the rep I spoke with told me that he had never been reported before, he had only ever committed one offense (in his chats with me), and that none of the other women who they met with had anything bad to say about him, so no further action could or would be taken.\" STEP 14. If HR lies to you, follow the next 27 steps. \n\"It was such a blatant lie that there was really nothing I could do. There was nothing any of us could do.\" STEP 15. Give up. (Don't worry, it's part of the plan.) \n\"We all gave up on Uber HR and our managers after that.\" STEP 16. As soon as you give up, he will leave the company. \n\"Eventually he 'left' the company. I don't know what he did that finally convinced them to fire him.\" STEP 17. Live in fear of being fired. \n\"We all lived under fear that our teams would be dissolved, there would be another re-org, and we'd have to start on yet another new project with an impossible deadline. It was an organization in complete, unrelenting chaos.\" STEP 18. Despite stepping into a hellhole every day and calling it a 'job,' keep giving it your all. \n\"We loved our work, we loved the engineering challenges, we loved making this crazy Uber machine work, and together we found ways to make it through the re-orgs and the changing OKRs and the abandoned projects and the impossible deadlines.\" STEP 19. If your company blames you for this mess and holds you back from professional success, accept it. \n\"I met all of the qualifications for transferring - I had managers who wanted me on their teams, and I had a perfect performance score - so I didn't see how anything could go wrong. And then my transfer was blocked.\" STEP 20. Listen to your managers try to explain your 'undocumented' performance problems. \n\"According to my manager, his manager, and the director, my transfer was being blocked because I had undocumented performance problems.\" STEP 21. When your managers can't really explain your 'undocumented' performance problems, consider how you can change your behavior. \n\"I pointed out that I had a perfect performance score, and that there had never been any complaints about my performance. I had completed all OKRs on schedule, never missed a deadline even in the insane organizational chaos, and that I had managers waiting for me to join their team. I asked what my performance problem was, and they didn't give me an answer.\" STEP 22. When your managers say your performance problems (still undocumented!) are due to your personal life, consider how you can change your personal life. \n\"I kept pushing, until finally I was told that 'performance problems aren't always something that has to do with work, but sometimes can be about things outside of work or your personal life.' I couldn't decipher that, so I gave up and decided to stay until my next performance review.\" STEP 23. Understand your performance review may be changed without your knowledge — the element of surprise is half the fun! \n\"Performance review season came around, and I received a great review with no complaints whatsoever about my performance. I waited a couple of months, and then attempted to transfer again. When I attempted to transfer, I was told that my performance review and score had been changed after the official reviews had been calibrated, and so I was no longer eligible for transfer.\" STEP 24. Listen closely if they tell you the punitive culture at your organization is due to your lack of ambition. \n\"When I asked management why my review had been changed after the fact (and why hadn't they let me know that they'd changed it?), they said that I didn't show any signs of an upward career trajectory.\" STEP 25. May God give you the serenity to accept the things you cannot change. \n\"I was stuck where I was.\" STEP 26. Your performance reviews don't really matter anyway, so just chill. \n\"I asked them to change my performance review back. My manager said that the new negative review I was given had no real-world consequences, so I shouldn't worry about it.\" STEP 27. The company has the right to take important things away from you, because you reported bad behavior. \n\"I was enrolled in a Stanford CS graduate program, sponsored by Uber, and Uber only sponsored employees who had high performance scores. Under both of my official performance reviews and scores, I qualified for the program, but after this sneaky new negative score I was no longer eligible.\" STEP 28. In good news, you can keep your job because you are a woman and #quotas! \n\"It turned out that keeping me on the team made my manager look good, and I overheard him boasting to the rest of the team that even though the rest of the teams were losing their women engineers left and right, he still had some on his team.\" STEP 29. Consider your options, again: transfer or quit. \n\"When I joined Uber, the organization I was part of was over 25% women. By the time I was trying to transfer to another eng organization, this number had dropped down to less than 6%. Women were transferring out of the organization, and those who couldn't transfer were quitting or preparing to quit.\" STEP 30. When your company says 'IT IS ALL YOUR FAULT, BE BETTER,' be better — why is this so difficult for you to understand? \n\"When I asked our director at an org all-hands about what was being done about the dwindling numbers of women in the org compared to the rest of the company, his reply was, in a nutshell, that the women of Uber just needed to step up and be better engineers.\" STEP 31. When your employers hold seminars on equality, take notes and be engaged so that they know you really care. \n\"One day, all of the women (there were, I believe, six of us left in the org) received an email saying that no leather jackets were being ordered for the women because there were not enough women in the organization to justify placing an order. I replied and said that I was sure Uber SRE could find room in their budget to buy leather jackets for the, what, six women if it could afford to buy them for over a hundred and twenty men. The director replied back, saying that if we women really wanted equality, then we should realize we were getting equality by not getting the leather jackets. He said that because there were so many men in the org, they had gotten a significant discount on the men's jackets but not on the women's jackets, and it wouldn't be equal or fair, he argued, to give the women leather jackets that cost a little more than the men's jackets.\" STEP 32. When your company continues to insist that this situation is entirely your fault, smile and nod. \n\"The HR rep began the meeting by asking me if I had noticed that *I* was the common theme in all of the reports I had been making, and that if I had ever considered that I might be the problem.\" STEP 33. Wipe your tears and lean the fuck in. \n\"I pointed out that everything I had reported came with extensive documentation and I clearly wasn't the instigator (or even a main character) in the majority of them - she countered by saying that there was absolutely no record in HR of any of the incidents I was claiming I had reported (which, of course, was a lie, and I reminded her I had email and chat records to prove it was a lie)\". STEP 34. If HR wants to know about all your communications, hide in a cupboard. \n\"She then asked me if women engineers at Uber were friends and talked a lot, and then asked me how often we communicated, what we talked about, what email addresses we used to communicate, which chat rooms we frequented, etc. - an absurd and insulting request that I refused to comply with.\" STEP 35. Handle straight-up discrimination like a lady and just listen. \n\"When I pointed out how few women were in SRE, she recounted with a story about how sometimes certain people of certain genders and ethnic backgrounds were better suited for some jobs than others, so I shouldn't be surprised by the gender ratios in engineering.\" STEP 36. Remember that reporting transgressions via email, for your records, is 'unprofessional.' \n\"Our meeting ended with her berating me about keeping email records of things, and told me it was unprofessional to report things via email to HR.\" STEP 37. You can always be fired. Stay alert. \n\"Less than a week after this absurd meeting, my manager scheduled a 1:1 with me, and told me we needed to have a difficult conversation. He told me I was on very thin ice for reporting his manager to HR. California is an at-will employment state, he said, which means we can fire you if you ever do this again. I told him that was illegal, and he replied that he had been a manager for a long time, he knew what was illegal, and threatening to fire me for reporting things to HR was not illegal.\" STEP 38. Laws are meaningless. They are mere words on scraps of paper. Adapt. \n\"I reported his threat immediately after the meeting to both HR and to the CTO: they both admitted that this was illegal, but none of them did anything.\" STEP 39. If a man is a high performer, he will always win, so overcompensate till you drop. \n\"(I was told much later that they didn't do anything because the manager who threatened me 'was a high performer').\" STEP 40. Always hold your head high despite being ignored, blamed and threatened by your company. \n\"When I look back at the time I spent at Uber, I'm overcome with thankfulness that I had the opportunity to work with some of the best engineers around. I'm proud of the work I did, I'm proud of the impact that I was able to make on the entire organization, and I'm proud that the work I did and wrote a book about has been adopted by other tech companies all over the world.\" STEP 41. If steps 1-40 don't work, gather your documentation, consult a lawyer and publish an account of this bullshit on your personal blog. Now you've got their attention. \nReflecting On One Very, Very Strange Year At Uber \n\"As most of you know, I left Uber in December and joined Stripe in January. I've gotten a lot of questions over the past couple of months about why I left and what my time at Uber was like. It's a strange, fascinating, and slightly horrifying story that deserves to be told while it is still fresh in my mind, so here we go.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:36:42.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
