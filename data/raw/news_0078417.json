(ABC News: David Sciasci) \nNatasha Shargatova said many Russians turned a blind eye to domestic violence. \nABC News: David Sciasci Close \nRussians opposed to the decriminalisation of domestic violence say they have not given up hope of bringing in a new law to protect women. \nBut they are up against changing cultural norms that are seeing Russia become increasingly conservative. \nPresident Vladimir Putin signed the law in early February, softening the penalties if the victim suffered no serious harm and it was not a repeat offence. \nIt was a move praised by ultra conservative MPs like Vitaly Milonov. Conservative politician Vitaly Milonov was pleased to see the softening of domestic violence laws. (ABC News: David Sciasci) \nConservative politician Vitaly Milonov was pleased to see the softening of domestic violence laws. \nABC News: David Sciasci Close \n\"If you want to kill someone for beating his wife or her husband it's not the way to solve the problem,\" he said. \nThere was no death penalty attached to battery offences but violence against a family member that did not cause serious physical injury could be punishable by up to two years in jail. \nMr Milonov said that was unacceptable. \n\"So how do you think this family can be restored after putting someone for two years into the prison for not harmful, for not hard beating?\" he said. \nThe ultra-Orthodox member of Mr Putin's United Russia Party is also a well-known campaigner against homosexuals. \n\"Family can only be heterosexual,\" he said, speaking at the Duma (parliament) in Moscow. \n\"All other versions with animals, vacuum cleaners or same sex, it cannot be called family.\" 'There is general disappointment in liberalism' The protest against the new domestic violence law in Moscow was smaller than expected (ABC News: David Sciasci) \nThe protest against the new domestic violence law in Moscow was smaller than expected \nABC News: David Sciasci Close \nThe director of the Russian International Affairs Council, Andrey Kortunov, said Russia was definitely becoming more conservative. \n\"The prevailing moods are more conservative than they used to be,\" he said. \n\"There is general disappointment in liberalism. The country is more nationalistic.\" \nBut Mr Kortunov said the messages coming from Russians were mixed. \n\"The most recent opinion polls show 70 per cent of Russians want better cooperation with the West. But they believe the West doesn't treat them fairly,\" he said \nThe latest step in this conservatism — the decriminalisation of domestic violence — attracted widespread condemnation. \nActivists say they are already seeing an increase in the number of women being attacked because men had been sent a signal that the offence was no longer being treated seriously. Teaser box: what happens if you oppose putin? \nAs thousands march in Moscow to remember assassinated opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, speaking out against the Kremlin is even harder than ever. \nAfter several attempts to get a permit to protest against the law, dozens of people, mostly women, rallied on a snowy Sunday afternoon in a Moscow park. \nThe crowd was smaller than expected and some blamed it on the fact the law had already been signed by Mr Putin by the time they were allowed to legally gather. \nNatasha Shargatova, a 24-year-old Muscovite, said people closed their eyes to the crime. \n\"They think if it does happen, it happens in far away villages where there's nothing to do but drink. That's where Muscovites think domestic violence is,\" she said. \n\"But that's just not true because it happens here too, but I guess people are just too ashamed to think about it.\" \nAccording to official figures, up to 14,000 women die every year in Russia and thousands more are injured. \nThere are very few shelters to help them. \nThe director of one shelter in a rural area outside of Moscow said she was overwhelmed with requests. The shelter has 12 beds and little support. \n\"Every year we get about 200 calls, some days four or five calls, and almost two thirds of them ask to stay with us,\" Alyona Sadikova said.
