We found somebody who will pay us,' he said, quoting the messenger.\nLagerfeld explained that per policy Chanel does not pay celebrities to wear its designs, but that hasn't stopped stars such as Emma Stone and Julianne Moore from wearing the luxury label on the red carpet.\nAlthough the fashion house doesn't pay people to wear its clothes, he pointed out that it is still very costly to gift an A-lister like Streep couture gowns, noting that the dress in question is worth approximately $105,000.\nDespite her alleged refusal to wear it to the Dolby Theatre on Sunday for the Academy Awards, Lagerfeld said she could keep the custom-made dress because it is 'perfect for her'.\nEye-catching: Lagerfeld said Streep had ordered a gray silk gown from Chanel's recent couture collection. Models are pictured walking in the Chanel Spring 2017 couture show\nClever: Streep, whose camp said it is against her ethics to be paid to wear a gown, wore Prada to the 2007 Oscars in celebration of her nomination for her role in The Devil Wears Prada\n'A genius actress, but cheapness also, no?' he added.\nIt's probably safe to say that Streep, who is nominated for Best Actress for her role in Florence Foster Jenkins, will not be wearing Chanel to any awards shows in the near future, as she has denied Lagerfeld's claims.\nA representative for the actress told The Hollywood Reporter that Lagerfeld's statement is false and it is against Streep's personal ethics to be paid to wear a gown on the red carpet.\nHowever, its not uncommon for celebrities to make money simply by donning certain gowns, jewels, and accessories for big awards shows.\nGolden girl: Although Streep has worn Lanvin to the Oscars on three different occasions, she does not have an ambassadorship with the brand. She is pictured in Lanvin at the Oscars in 2012 (left) and 2015 (right)\nFive-years running: Celebrity stylist Jessica Paster calls paid relationships between designers and brands 'ambassadorships'. Jennifer Lawrence has been an ambassador for Dior since 2012 (left) and donned the label to the 2016 Oscars (right)\nCelebrity stylist Jessica Paster previously revealed that stars can receive up to $250,000 to wear a dress on the red carpet.\nPaster was on a panel with fellow stylists Erin Walsh, Brad Goreski, and Brandon Maxel at the 2015 Vulture festival when she lifted the lid on the prevalent practice.\nThe stylist, who has worked with Cate Blanchett, Emily Blunt, Miranda Kerr, Sandra Bullock, and Rachel McAdams, insisted it is a common occurrence in the industry.\n\"Jewelry people are paying, shoe people are paying, tampon companies are paying, everyone is paying,' she said.\n'It could be just paying the stylist and we get anywhere between $30,000 to $50,0000. Or it's paying the actress something between $100,000 and $250,000.'\nLoyal fan: Michelle Williams has starred in numerous handbag campaigns for Louis Vuitton (left), and she wore the luxury brand to this year's Golden Globes (right)\nFamous face: Natalie Portman has starred in numerous campaigns for Miss Dior perfume (left), and she showed off her baby bump in a white Dior frock at the 2017 Screen Actors Guild Awards (right)\nPaster admitted she has been offered money to dress a client, and she has no problem accepting money if it is the right gown for the person she is working with.\n'If it looks gorgeous on you and this is the dress we were going to pick anyway, why not be paid?' she said.\nAnd while Goreski said at the time that he had never been offered money to dress a client in a certain designer, he knows it's not unusual.\n'If someone shows up to the Oscars in a black dress and huge statement necklace, chances are they're being paid by a jewelry company,' he noted.\nPaster also dished about why some actresses wear the same designer over and over again, and it is all about building a paid relationship between a brand and a celebrity.\nFaithful: Blake Lively starred in perfume campaigns for Gucci in 2012 (left) and 2014, and she wore the designer label to the Cannes Film Festival in 2014 (right)\nGive and take: Cate Blanchett and Keira Knightly have starred in campaigns for Armani Prive and Chanel, respectively. Cate is pictured in Armani Prive at the 2016 Oscars, and Keira can be seen wearing Chanel at the Golden Globes in 2015\n'They're ambassadorships and you start relationships with them (the brand), and then eventually, the actress often does get a campaign from them because they have a relationship with her,' she said.\nOscar winner Jennifer Lawrence has been an ambassador for Dior since 2012, and she frequently wears the label on the red carpet.\nMichelle Williams, who is nominated for an Oscar for her role in Manchester by the Sea, is an ambassador for Louis Vuitton and has worn the French luxury label throughout this year's awards season.\nNatalie Portman, Cate Blanchett, Keira Knightly, and Blake Lively are also among the A-listers who have worn a certain label's designs on the red carpet after scoring an ad campaign with that particular brand.\nStreep famously wore Prada to the 2007 Oscars in celebration of her nomination for her role in The Devil Wears Prada and she has also worn Lanvin to the Academy Awards three times so far, but so-far has never been an ambassador for a particular brand.", "external_links": ["http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/karl-lagerfeld-chanel-meryl-streep-passed-on-oscar-dress-when-chanel-oscar-dress-10817502/", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/meryl-street-sets-record-straight-karl-lagerfelds-pay-wear-comments-979334", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-24T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:55:06.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
