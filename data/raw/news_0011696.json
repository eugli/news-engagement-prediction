The Hewlett boys finished first with a 5,433 total. MacArthur finished as runner-up with 5,241 and Massapequa was third with 5,171. \nJP West rolled the high game of the day for Hewlett in Game 2 with a 237. Four of five Bulldogs bowlers bowled above a 200 in Game 2 to give Hewlett a lead that it never relinquished. Bryan Krinick bowled a 234 in the third game and Zane Lipson bowled a 235 in the fourth game to help Hewlett secure its second title in the past three seasons. \n“It is really a great accomplishment for myself and the team because this year we weren’t expected to do this well,” Lipson said. “We wanted to prove to our coach exactly how good we can be and we wanted to show the seniors on the team that we can carry this team for the next few years.” \nThe Hewlett boys will join the Syosset girls at the March 4 state tournament.
