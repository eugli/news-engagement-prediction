He had come to Malaysia on Feb 6 and carried a passport with the name of Kim Chol. \nMalaysian police have so far arrested Siti Aishah; another woman who carried a Vietnamese passport with the name Doan Thi Huong; a Malaysian man and a North Korean man. \nAsria said Siti Aishah only had primary religious school education but she was hardworking and showed determination to unshackle herself from poverty even as a young girl. \nShe was in her teens when she started working as a clothing salesgirl in Jakarta, he said to Bernama . \nAsria dismissed local media reports saying that Siti Aishah was fluent in English and Korean. \nHe said Siti Aishah was married to a businessman and they had a son. She and her husband divorced in 2012 and she left home to work in Batam. \n\"After she went to Batam, we hardly saw her. The last time she returned home was during Chinese New Year last month. She also said then that she was working as a salesperson. \n\"We are indeed surprised that she had gone over to Malaysia,\" Asria said when met at his home in Kampung Rancasumur, Sindangsari Pabuaran, in Serang. \nSerang is the capital city of Banten province in the westernmost part of Java island. \nSiti Aishah is the youngest of three siblings. Her two brothers work as labourers and their parents eke out a living selling potatoes and turmeric. \nAsria said the family members came to know of Siti Aishah's arrest from her in-laws last Thursday, but they received no other information since and no visits by any authorities until two days ago. \n\"Two days ago, a representative of the Foreign Ministry came and confirmed that my daughter had been arrested in Malaysia but we were not told what happened,\" he said. \nAsria spoke highly of Siti Aishah, saying she was an active child who made her parents proud as she was self-reliant and did not brood over the hardship she experienced. \n\"Despite being poor, Siti Aishah is a hardworking and friendly girl, but never naughty,\" he said. \nAsria expressed the desire to meet his daughter. \n\"We can only cry thinking about the fate of our youngest daughter,\" he lamented. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:15:31.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
