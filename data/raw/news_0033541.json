Highest snowfall report of 30\" at the small town of Cary Plantation. Numerous reports around 2 feet now. #mewx \n— NWS Caribou (@NWSCaribou) February 13, 2017 Cary is near the Canadian border and has registered the most snow in Maine from the storm that still was active Monday evening. But there were several towns not far behind, including Dexter, which got 28 inches, and Island Falls, which logged 25 inches. Meteorologists say some towns see similarly high snowfall totals every few years. And the numbers still can rise. The storm is expected to continue on for several more hours before petering out Monday evening.
