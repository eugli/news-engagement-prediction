We all know that Liberals don't,\" an angry Ms Dodd said today. \n\"We all know that Liberals want to sell off Western Power. One Nation doesn't, so what the hell is going on? \n\"I encourage other members of One Nation to stand up, do not be bullied and do not be dictated to. \n\"I will not be part of a dictatorship.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:18:16.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
