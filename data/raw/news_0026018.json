Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nActor David Tennant says that he would back Scottish independence in a second referendum, in a shift from views he has expressed before. \nThe 45-year-old Dr Who and Broadchurch star branded everything Brexit -related \"depressing\", but said he did not expect people to listen to what he said. \nSpeaking to The Times Magazine, he said: \"And I'm now at the point where I think if Scotland goes again for a referendum, they should go independent. \nTennant added: \"Politically, I think we're in for quite a dark time.\" \nAhead of the September 2014 Scottish referendum on independence, he told the Mirror : \"I feel very Scottish, I feel very proud to be Scottish. I'm very happy that Scotland conducted itself with the as much democratic dignity as it did. I'm very proud of the homeland.\" Olivia Coleman (left) and Tennant as the leads in ITV's hit series, Broadchurch (Photo: ITV) Read More Who will be the next Doctor Who lead? It's time for a new Time Lord after Peter Capaldi quits the TARDIS \nBack in 2011, he was even more explicit when speaking to the Guardian : \"I could never understand why the SNP were banging on about it. I was like, why do we want to become smaller? Surely we want to expand and look outward? Let's go into Europe and be one big happy family!\" \nThe actor explained that while it was inevitable his personal views would surface during interviews, they were no more important than someone else's. \nAround the time of the last vote for independence, Tennant, who was born in Bathgate, West Lothian, reportedly said it was not for him to have an opinion as he no longer considered himself to be Scottish. \nIn the September 2014 Scottish independence referendum the country voted by a margin of around 55%-45% to stay part of the United Kingdom. \nBut there have been calls for a second referendum after Scots voted to remain in the EU last year, contrary to the popular vote across the rest of Britain. poll loading Have you changed your view on Scottish independence? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T16:39:13.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
