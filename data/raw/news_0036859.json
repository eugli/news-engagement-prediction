Did Marcus Smart really graze Jimmy Butler’s elbow on a missed jumper with 0.9 seconds remaining, and should that supposed contact have been the difference between a Celtics win and a 104-103 loss ? \nFirst, here’s the play in question: Replay Review (Foster): if Smart committed a foul before time expired, Q4 of #BOSatCHI . Ruling: Foul committed by Smart with 0.9 remaining. pic.twitter.com/IVhYoPCm4R \nThe Celtics, obviously, believed they got screwed by the call. But Butler insisted it was pretty clear-cut . \n“A foul’s a foul. (Smart) hit my elbow,” Butler said after the game, via The Chicago Tribune. “I don’t care what nobody says. I think I’m making it if he don’t alter it like that.” \nSmart didn’t say specifically whether he touched Butler’s elbow. Yet a screengrab shows his fingers might have barely grazed the Bulls star on his shooting arm. Did he hit him?

Still, you hate to see a game decided on such a ticky-tack call, especially since the referee made it a couple seconds after Butler already had shot the ball. \nThumbnail photo via Mike DiNovo/USA TODAY Sports Images \nHave a question for Darren Hartwell?
