Not that they wouldn’t become lottery picks if swimming had a draft like the NBA does. \nFor the northern rim of Indianapolis to have two such swimmers simultaneously deviates from convention. Indiana (pop. 6.6 million) is not the swim incubator of, say, California, Florida or Texas. When it comes to the pool, though, you won’t find two more hurryin’ Hoosiers. \n“They’re making each other better,” Carmel coach Chris Plumb said. \nThe two juniors will lead their respective teams in the 80th state meet at the Natatorium at IUPUI. Preliminaries start at 6 p.m. Friday and finals at 1 p.m. Saturday. \nIn each of the past two years, Carmel finished first and Zionsville second. \nSeedings suggest the top-ranked Greyhounds should three-peat. Plumb said they are aiming higher — for a national championship, which is determined by comparing times around the country. \nIt is that kind of ambition pushing Kibler and Franzman. Kibler chases national records, and Franzman chases Kibler.

We’re Team Indiana, Team USA.” \nAs Franzman put it: \n“We’re really good friends when we’re dry.” \nWhen they raced at the 2015 state meet, they represented other high schools: Kibler for North Central and Franzman for Brownsburg. Both families moved after their freshman years, and the Indiana High School Athletic Association ruled Kibler ineligible and Franzman eligible for 2016. \nKibler lived in Noblesville while enrolled at North Central, and his family moved to Carmel to be closer to both parents’ Indianapolis workplaces. (Kibler had been coached by the high school coaches at Carmel Swim Club, so the IHSAA invoked its past link rule, delaying eligibility for 365 days.) \nFranzman won state titles in the 50- and 100-yard freestyles. Kibler watched from the stands as his Carmel teammates edged Zionsville by one point . \nIf anything, Kibler said the IHSAA decision enhanced his swimming because he focused earlier on the summer season. He won junior nationals in the 200-meter freestyle and brought home three medals from August’s Junior Pan Pacific meet . \n“The hardest part was to be accused of not living in Carmel, which we were the whole time,” said Tracy Kibler, his mother. “Drew, though, was such an example of class. Never once did he act bitter about it.” Buy Photo \nZionsville's Jack Franzman flashes a thumbs up after winning his 50 yard freestyle heat, during the IHSAA boys 2017 Sectional Swimming & Diving Finals, at Zionsville high School, Feb. 18, 2017.

After Kibler won the “B” final of the 50-meter freestyle in 22.80 seconds, Franzman said he wanted to beat that time in the “A” final — then clocked 22.68 to secure a silver medal. \nSimilarly, Franzman dropped his time by nearly a full second to place third in December’s winter nationals in the 100-yard freestyle — just behind Kibler. Later that month, Franzman upset Kibler in a dual meet , swimming the first 50 of the 100 nearly as fast as he had in winning the 50 freestyle. \nThere’s no forecasting what Franzman could do if he pretended every other swimmer were named Drew Kibler. \n“That’s kind of what I do at practice,” Franzman said. \nThe Zionsville swimmer is the more demonstrative of the two, celebrating victories after touching the wall. Other Carmel students are only vaguely aware of what Kibler has done, and he’s not one to tell them. \nFranzman’s hairstyle was a bleached Mohawk at sectionals, and he often wears a fedora. He has a chest tattoo — M.D.C, Mind over Matter — in honor of his late maternal grandfather, Michael David Coombs. \nSo far, Kibler has superior credentials. There are reasons for that.
