Article continues below \nSeveral months earlier, Payet had put pen-to-paper on a new five-and-a-half-year contract worth £125,000-a-week. It seemed he’d found a permanent home in east London and was quite happy to become a Hammer for life. \nBut when the going got tough this season, Payet suddenly decided he missed France and wanted out. In the process, he lost the respect of everyone connected to West Ham - from the board members, through to his teammates and, most importantly, the club’s supporters. Article continues below Jamie Carragher sums up Ranieri's sacking with scathing two-word tweet to Leicester West Ham fans now hate Payet \nPayet hadn’t even left West Ham when a video emerged of fans using his shirt as a doormat at the London Stadium. \nIf he ever returns to the Hammers’ home ground in the future, the fans might set a record noise level with their collective booing. \nHell hath no fury like a lover (in this case, the West Ham fanbase) scorned. \nIncredibly, though, you can still buy Payet-related merchandise in the club’s official store. \nDavid Gold, David Sullivan and Karen Brady are seriously optimistic if they think these items will shift. \nFirst of all, we have this blue Payet shirt. RRP £20, reduced to £3 - but only available in Large, XL and XXL. \nAnd West Ham fans can also snap up this signed 2016-17 home shirt for just £150, reduced from £300 following his departure. Surely no fan will buy these - despite the discounts \nWe’ll be amazed - stunned, even - if these items sell. \nEven if they knocked another 90 per cent off both products, which West Ham fan in their right mind is going to part with their hard-earned cash on anything do with the player who let them down so badly? \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
