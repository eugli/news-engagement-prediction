When they peered over the wall, they saw a small sea of yellow fluffiness: 1000 abandoned day old chicks. The RSPCA were summoned, and, with help from volunteers, they loaded the chicks into cardboard boxes before taking them back to the hatchery where they'd come from. \nThe details of this saga are still being investigated, but it seems that somebody bought the birds from the hatchery, then dumped them. They were all female chicks, destined to be laying hens. \nThe video and images made startling viewing and have been shared widely on social media. The comments from onlookers make interesting reading, drawing attention to the fact that most of us have no idea about how and where our food is produced. “They need their mamas!” is a typical response: the truth is that they were hatched in an incubator, and they never have, and never will see their mothers. Nor do any of the poultry used in commercial production: there is no such thing as a bird family in this world. Credit: PA \nS omeone else said “they were lucky not to be thrown into a blender”. This is a reference to the fact that when laying poultry are hatched, their gender is determined (by skilled manual chicken sexers), and only the females are kept for rearing. Male chicks are worthless: they (obviously) can't lay eggs, and they don't grow fast enough to produce meat cost effectively. The hatchery dispenses with them as humanely as possible. In many countries, a “macerator” is used: this does indeed resemble a blender. It's a shocking sight to see the fluffy yellow chicks being carried along a conveyor belt, cheeping, before falling helplessly into a funnel that drops them alive into a powerful mincing machine. This type of killing is not used in the UK any more: instead, the chicks are killed by placing them into a gas chamber that uses argon to end their lives. This is a humane way of killing them: they show no sign of respiratory distress, and it’s far less distressing to onlookers than a “blender”. \nThe bodies of the gas-killed dead day old chicks are sold on to zoos and owners of exotic animals, where they are used to feed animals in captivity. Despite the fact that there are 30 million laying hens in this country, the UK is a net importer of day old chicks: we do not produce enough to supply the demand from our exotic animal food market. In the UK, free-range systems now account for around 50% of all eggs produced \nC hicken production - for meat and eggs - is a huge business. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird, with over 50 billion chickens reared annually (that’s over six hens for each of the 7.5 billion people on this planet). \nBack in 1950, chicken was such a treat that most British people ate less than a kilo in a whole year. Now, we eat more than 2 kg per month (25kg in a year on average). Industrial scale chicken production means that chicken is cheap: if we are only paying £3 in a supermarket for a whole chicken, it’s obvious that there isn’t much investment in the bird’s quality of life. Chickens reared for meat live for no longer than six weeks, compared to a life span of six years in the wild for comparable birds. \nOur egg consumption is also much higher than in the past, with around 30 million eggs eaten in the UK every year. The barren battery cage developed for “maximal efficiency” were an early target for animal welfare campaigners: they’ve been banned in Europe since 2012, but around the world, over 3 billion hens are still kept in these cages in other countries (95% of egg laying hens in the USA live in battery cages). Volunteers and the RSPCA carefully move the day old chicks into boxes \nE uropean animal welfare laws ensure that there is - at least - a basic regard for animal welfare on British farms, and a recent poll found that 81% of the public believe that post Brexit animal welfare laws in the UK should be improved or at least kept at the same level. \nIn the UK, free-range systems now account for around 50% of all eggs produced, and these, along with other higher welfare systems , have made a significant difference to the quality of life of many British egg-laying hens. Higher welfare systems for meat producing chickens are also available, but have yet to become as popular as the egg-laying equivalents, with around 28% of the market . \nDo most British hens have a life worth living? If you watch backyard hens scratching around the garden, and compare this with the behaviour allowed to intensively reared poultry, the answer to this question is obvious. \nWhat was the outcome for those abandoned day-old chicks? After being returned by the RSPCA to the hatchery, the chicks were judged to be at risk of carrying Avian Flu, and so they were all euthanased (in the gas chamber). Their cute cheeps slowly dimmed to silence: the reality of animal food production.
