Police identified them as Corey Dukes and Darrion Vankleeck, both 18 years old. \nDuke was allegedly armed. \n“It’s healing. I just took off the bandage today,” said Kladchihin, showing his injured elbow. \nPolice say there were two others in a waiting SUV. They’ve been identified as Adolfo Vela and Anne Feeley, aged 18, as well. \n“These four individuals observed our victim walking down the roadway, selected him because he was walking by himself, approached him and, as we saw in the video, violently attack this individual,” said Wilton Manors Police Commander Gary Blocker. \nKladchikhin said they tackled him to the ground and then stole his wallet, phone and a small amount of cash. They then bashed him in the head with the gun just before 4 a.m. on Feburary 12th as he walked near his home. Police say he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n“They tried to kill me for $12 and that’s what makes me feel weird,” said Kladchikhin. “What are people doing?” \nPolice blanketed the area with flyers in the days after the attack. They said that led to an anonymous call to the police department with information that lead to the four arrests. Detectives are checking to see if they could be involved in other cases. \n“Currently was are looking at this foursome from a broad perspective, initial indication is we know they’re involved with this crime, we’re still evaluating other cases,” said Blocker. \nVankleeck, Dukes, and Vela were charged with armed robbery and grand theft. \nFeely was charged with being an accessory after the fact. \nPolice have said that this was no hate crime, but rather one of opportunity. The arrests made in this case are not linked with the home invasion robbery that occurred on February 18th. \nKladchikhin still walks with a limp because of the attack. He’s hoping the streets are safer with the suspects under arrest but that does little to ease the fears that haunt him. \n“I started to worry about who’s following me,” he admitted. “I’m afraid to stay in my apartment alone. It’s weird.” Ted Scouten facebook Follow Emmy award winning journalist Ted Scouten has been the familiar face at the scene of international stories that affect South Florida since 1998.
