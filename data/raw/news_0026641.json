Article continues below \nNevertheless, as a result of the constant speculation, there are many United supporters who feel the deal is practically a foregone conclusion. \nBut those fans might be very interested to hear Griezmann's latest comments on his future, where he has appeared to cast doubt on a move to the Premier League.

For the moment, I do not know where that desire came from. Who knows how the season will finish. If it finishes badly, maybe I will ask myself the question,\" Griezmann said, as per The Mirror . \n\"Aside from that, I am asking myself where I could go. In Spain, there is Barcelona and Real Madrid. Barcelona have the three up top. Real Madrid, that is impossible because of the club I am at. I think that between them, there is a pact. \n\"Germany, the league does not attract me much. France, not for the moment. And England, I have a lot of doubts about my private life. Everything like rain, bad weather… I need to feel happy outside.” \nWhile the Man United hierarchy can potentially control his wages, where he lives, even what his first car could be, one thing they cannot account for is the unpredictable British weather. \nIt's true, for someone who has spent the last eight years in sunny Spain, a wet and windy Carrington doesn't really have much appeal in comparison. \nSafe to say Griezmann's excuse hasn't gone down too well with United fans who have been tweeting their thoughts. Here's the best reaction: \nThe 25-year-old admitted he does watch the Premier League on a regular basis and enjoys the style of play but that might not be enough to persuade him to move at the end of the season. \nGriezmann added: “I like the teams who bring intensity like in England. Yes, I watch the English league. The referees let the game flow, the stadiums are always full. \n\"But if I have to choose one league, it is the Spanish league, because it corresponds the best with my game.” \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
