But ask the average Gooner and they will insist that no other set of fans suffer like they suffer. As far as regulars at the Emirates are concerned, they may have Champions League football, world class players and an awesome stadium… but they also have to suffer the unique combination of hope and despair that comes from following The Gunners. It may sound absurd - but never before has that experience been better illustrated than by Arsenal's 2-1 defeat to Watford. (Photo: PA) \nHere are the seven reasons the home loss summed up everything that is awful about being an Arsenal fan: 1. It came hot on the heels of a brilliant performance (Photo: Shaun Botterill) \n\"We just beat Southampton 5-0! We look awesome! We're flying! Maybe this really is going to be our season! Maybe it really is all going to click this time! Once we beat Watford, we'll close the gap to… \n\"OH.\" 2. It also came just days after Arsene Wenger said something completely over the top about his side's abilities (Photo: REUTERS) \nNo. we're not making that up. Just a few days ago, the Arsenal boss really did say: \n“I think certainly numbers wise and quality wise, this is the best attacking unit. We had never so many players who could perform and score goals – certainly never.\" \nIn other words, he said his current team are better going forward than his Invincibles side (Henry, Bergkamp et al) were… just before they were beaten at home by Watford. \nImmaculate, Wenger-style timing. 3. It happened on Deadline Day - the day that traditionally sees Arsenal fans tearing their hair out in frustration \n\"ANNOUNCE BENZEMA!\" 4. Despite the horror show, Alexis Sanchez managed to do something positive (Photo: REUTERS) \nEven with the his team folding around him, the chunky Chilean still managed to bag an assist for Alex Iwobi's goal - once again proving that he is not far from trying to do pretty much everything on his own. 5. There was an injury - and an excuse for fans to get furious on Twitter - early on (Photo: Getty Images) \nIf we were looking a little more deeply at this, you could say Aaron Ramsey's night (well, his 20 minutes) summed up Arsenal fans' current mood. 6. Arsenal were clearly looking ahead to the game against Chelsea at the weekend… and forgot to beat Watford (Photo: Mike Hewitt) \nWhy else would you leave Hector Bellerin (top class full-back) on the bench and play Gabriel (not even a top class centre-back) on the right side of your defence? 7. And perhaps most crucially, on the night that Arsenal's biggest rivals all dropped points two points (Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham)… so Arsenal dropped three OH, ARSENAL. Will Arsenal make the top four this season? 2000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:21:39.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
