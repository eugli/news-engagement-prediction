However, not even an Academy Award winning director could've scripted this finish.\nLeading 60-58 with 3.2 seconds to go, Lake Taylor went to the free-throw line to shoot a pair of foul shots, looking to salt away a home playoff victory and earn their second straight State Tournament berth. The Titans missed both. That gave Smithfield a chance - albeit a slim one - to stage a miraculous finish.\nPackers 6'5\" sophomore forward Tory Robertson grabbed the rebound, passed quickly to senior teammate Chris Pierce .\nPierce, the 6'4\" forward headed to Vanderbilt on a football scholarship, chose not to attempt a desperation shot as time ticked down and instead found fellow senior Keon Tucker , who flung a prayer just beyond half-court at the buzzer.\nHis prayer was answered, sending the Packers and their fans that stormed the Norfolk court into celebratory mode following a 61-60 win they won't ever forget.\n\"Just give it my best shot. I knew if I got a good look, I had to square up and give my best heave. Thank God it went in,\" the 6'1\" Tucker said. \"Unbelievable... I'm shocked.\"\nVideo of Buzzer-Beater Courtesy of the Pilot's Larry Rubama: Smithfield wins on last second shot to stun Lake Taylor, 61-60 pic.twitter.com/TCaaIIlCAt\nâ€” Larry Rubama (@LHRubama) February 22, 2017 Buzzer Shot from half court by Keon!! 61-60 #RingChasing ðŸ’™ðŸ’› pic.twitter.com/EPAlFbn7FY\nâ€” Meredith (@mereditholiver_) February 22, 2017 Tucker's game-winner was actually the second buzzer-beater of the night for Smithfield. To end the first half, senior guard Ryan Jones swished a three-pointer at the horn to give the Packers a 31-28 lead.\nWith the win, Smithfield moves to 20-4 overall and will make their first trip to the State Tournament since 1989. That year, the Packers won 11 of their final 12 regular season games to capture the Peanut District title. They ended up seeing their season end in the quarterfinal round against Blacksburg.\nHow the Packers achieved this victory made it all the more special.\n\"Being that Smithfield hasn't gone this far, it's great,\" added Tucker. \"It's a great feeling.\"\nVideo Interview - Smithfield's Keon Tucker on Buzzer-Beater: Packers Show Resolve Under Pressure: It was a back-and-forth battle that featured 15 lead changes and four ties. Neither team got up by more than six points - or two possessions - the entire night. Smithfield trailed 51-46 at the start of the fourth quarter. Though they would go ahead a few times in the final stanza, it looked bleak with the host Titans ahead by four with 40 seconds to go after junior guard Joe Bryant made a pair of free-throws.\nPierce, who scored half of his team-high 16 points in the fourth quarter, cut the deficit to 60-58 with 19 seconds to go. Jones, the team's leading scorer on the season at 14.1 points per game, fouled out on the next possession.\nBryant missed the front-end of a one-and-one opportunity at the charity stripe and the Packers drove in for a potential game-tying basket that would be off the mark. Tyrone Washington came up with the loose basketball with 3.7 seconds to play.\nSmithfield, which missed a shot at the buzzer in a heart-breaking 65-64 loss to Jamestown for the Ironclad Conference 18 Tournament Championship just four days prior, looked like it was about to suffer its second straight nail-biting defeat.\n\"We had our heart taken from us the other night (against Jamestown). To rebound like this is tremendous. Credit to the guys because they fought through, knowing that the season was on the line,\" remarked Smithfield Head Coach Richard Pullen .\n\"They kept to the game-plan, fought through on every possession and we're grateful.\"\nRyan Jones and the Packers are guaranteed at least three more games Matthew Hatfield Amazingly, Smithfield's top two offensive options - Jones and injured forward Sascha Stafford , who is second on the team in points at 13.5 per game and second in rebounds at 7.5 a contest - were not on the court for the final sequence. In the final huddle before the Packers' winning play for the ages, a voice spoke up to seize the moment.\n\"Keon stepped up in the time-out and said, 'I'm going to take the shot.' For him and the guys he's been playing with since rec ball, the whole community at Smithfield and the rest of the guys on the team, I'm happy,\" Pullen said.\nStafford missed his second consecutive game with a foot injury, though hopes to return on Thursday for the regional semifinals against Hanover (12-14), a 75-53 victor over King George in the quarterfinals.\nWork in the Paint Opens Up Looks for Smithfield: Facing a fierce Lake Taylor offensive attack that came in averaging 76 points per game, thriving in transition, the Packers felt it would to their disadvantage to get into a track meet with the Titans.\nSure, there were some moments where they scored on the break, but it was imperative to not give Lake Taylor a lot of easy points at the rim, forcing them to instead do their damage on perimeter jumpers. In fact, the Titans had only one dunk the whole night, which came in the third quarter courtesy of junior Dereon Seabron .\nEarly on, the three-pointers were falling for the Titans. Lake Taylor made three shots behind the arc in the opening period, two courtesy of their lone senior starter, Demontae Tyler . They soon cooled off though, finishing the night 4-of-29 from long distance. That included 0-of-8 on triple tries in the fourth quarter.\nThe other challenge for Smithfield was not to fold against the aggressive pressure defense of the Titans that caused 23 turnovers, 16 of them during the game's two middle quarters.\n\"Knowing that they've been to the Finals last year, are hungry for it and bring pressure all game long, we just told the guys that we've got to keep this close and can't play at their pace,\" Pullen noted.\nVanderbilt football recruit Chris Pierce paced the Packers with 16 points and five blocks Matthew Hatfield Every time Lake Taylor was on the verge of a run to distance themselves from the Packers, Smithfield capitalized on the offensive end. Pierce was a force along the baseline, not just with 16 points as he made 5-of-10 field goals and 6-of-8 from the foul line, but also in the form of collecting eight rebounds and blocking five shots.\n\"Chris has been playing phenomenal. He's coming into his own right now and doing everything that we want him to do, making great decisions,\" Pullen commented.\n\"Tory's stepping up to the plate and giving us some great minutes and Jameek Jordan also filling in for Sascha.\"\nRobertson chipped in seven points and eight rebounds off the bench. Smithfield finished with a 35-32 advantage in the rebounding department, cashing in on several of their nine offensive boards.\nSmithfield was much more selective and accurate on its three-point shots, sinking at least one in each quarter and concluding the contest 7-of-11 from beyond the arc.\nVideo Interview - Smithfield Coach Richard Pullen after 61-60 win: Tough Finish for Talented Titans: Sometimes, history does repeat itself.\nLake Taylor saw its 16-game winning streak snapped on Tuesday night in a loss that'll stick with them all off-season long. Their closest win during that streak was the first one, a 66-60 triumph over Cox at the Norfolk Scope Holiday Classic.\nThe Titans played only one other game all season decided by five points or fewer, a 66-62 double-overtime loss to 5A State Tournament qualifier Bethel in December.\nSimilar to last year's ending, which came in a 57-53 loss to a Monacan team they had beaten earlier in the regional semifinals, this finish was difficult to swallow. That day, they went the final 4:37 of regulation without a field goal. An eight-point lead with less than five minutes to play evaporated as the Titans went 2-of-6 from the charity stripe in the second half.\nDemontae Tyler is the lone senior starter graduating from Lake Taylor's team that went 20-4 Matthew Hatfield Lake Taylor made their first five free-throws against Smithfield, then went just 5-of-12 there in the fourth quarter.\nBack in 1984, Green Run hit a buzzer-beater to defeat Lake Taylor, 55-54, in triple-overtime for the Eastern Region Championship.\nFour starters - Bryant, Seabron, junior Jalen Jordan and freshman Anthony Hicks - are slated to return for the Titans. Jordan filled the stat sheet in his first game back in a couple weeks since an ankle injury.\nTo exercise past postseason frustrations, the Titans will have to wait another year. They closed out the 2016-17 campaign at 20-4 overall.\nFinal Stats: Smithfield Packers 61: (20-4 Overall)\nChris Pierce - 16Pts. 5-10FG, 6-8FT, 7Reb. 5Blk. 2Ast. 2Stl.\nKeon Tucker - 13Pts. 4-6FG, 3-4 3's, GW 3, 4Reb. 2Ast.\nPeter Moore - 12Pts. 5-11FG, 2-3 3's, 4Ast. 2Stl.\nTory Robertson - 7Pts. 3-6FG, 8Reb.\nRyan Jones - 5Pts. 2-10FG, 1-2 's, 8Reb. 6Ast.
