They’ll play back that “yes” answer to make it sound like the victim had previously authorized the purchase.\n“If they make a hundred of these calls and they get two or three people to pay, then they’re making money,” said Evan Kelly of the Better Business Bureau of Mainland B.C.\nKelly says you should also let you banks know that you’ve received these calls so they can red flag anything on your account that may have been from out of country.\nMore than 70 per cent of complaints to the BBB’s ScamTracker line in the U.S. involves this robocall and B.C. is now getting hit with it too.\nThe BBB is offering consumers the following advice:\nDon’t answer unfamiliar calls – if it’s important they’ll leave a message and you can call back Make a note of the number and report it to the BBB ScamTracker (bbb.org/scamtracker).
