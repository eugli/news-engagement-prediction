Michael Vick (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:32 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:32 p.m. ET \nMichael Vick was one of the most polarizing figures in NFL history, and his controversial career has come to an end. \nThe dual-threat quarterback, who sat out all of the 2016 season, told ESPN's Josina Anderson on Friday that he is officially hanging up his cleats. \nMORE: Colin Kaepernick reportedly will opt out of 49ers contract to become free agent \nVick, 36, ended his 13-season NFL career with 133 touchdowns and 88 interceptions. He also rushed for 36 touchdowns. Unfortunately, his career was tainted by a brutal dog fighting scandal that led to prison time for the dynamic quarterback. \nIn a Players' Tribune article earlier this month, Vick chronicled his love for the Atlanta Falcons, the team that drafted him with the No. 1 overall pick in 2001. \n\"I wanted to lead the Falcons to the Super Bowl. \n\"When I tell people this, at first, I think most of them have the same reaction — that I was delusional. Mike, you really thought, after all that, that you were going to come back to the Falcons … and start at quarterback … like nothing had happened? \n\"I think people would hear that I had hung on to the hope of returning to Atlanta as their quarterback … and then maybe assume that I was in denial about my entire situation. That I still wasn’t able to accept the full severity of what I had done. \n\"But there was one thing that I just had a permanent blind spot for: being the starting quarterback of the Falcons. It was something that I had taken so much pride in … something that I had come to identify myself with so strongly. Who was I? I was Mike Vick, quarterback, Atlanta Falcons. I was those five words.\" \nVick will go down as a revolutionary quarterback that paved the way for a plethora of other signal-callers of the same style.
