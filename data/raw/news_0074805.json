He originally was tried at fullback but returned to his customary left midfield role full time in 2016. He recorded three goals and two assists over 27 league matches (22 starts) last season. \nThe winger, who turns 27 on Tuesday, broke in with FC Dallas in 2008, playing five seasons before his move to England. An MVP finalist in 2011, Shea has been capped 34 times by the U.S. national team but has not made an international appearance since 2015. \nVIDEO: Kaka opens   with goal \n“We are excited to welcome Brek to our club and city,\" Whitecaps coach Carl Robinson said in a news release. \"Brek is a tall, physical, skilled player and will bring a different dimension to our attack. Brek will join the group in coming days and we anticipate he will be available for selection as early as this Thursday's Champions League match against New York.” \nBarnes, 28, has scored 33 times in 123 regular season matches since coming to MLS in 2012. Having previously spent his entire MLS career with the Houston Dynamo, Barnes netted twice in 10 games after a midseason trade to Vancouver last year. \n“We’re thrilled to boost our attack with a player like Giles. His versatility to score and create goals will be a valuable asset this season,” Orlando general manager Niki Budalic said in a news release. “I’d like to thank Brek for his exemplary professionalism during his time with our club.” \nThe London-born Barnes has featured 18 times for Jamaica and was a key player in the nation’s surprise run to the 2015 Gold Cup final. \nBarnes does not occupy an international spot for Orlando because he holds a U.S. green card.
