As a first step all children should be able to access mental health and wellbeing support such as counselling in schools so they get support early to prevent a problem becoming a crisis.”\nChildline said early signs of a serious mental health problem in children and young people include becoming withdrawn from friends and family, being tearful or irritable, sudden outbursts, and problems eating or sleeping.\nOne 16-year-old girl told Childline: “I want to know what’s wrong with me. I have been seeing a counsellor about my mental health issues recently but they just told me to eat and sleep better and forget about the past, which didn’t help me at all.\nShe added: “I wish I could speak to someone who actually cared about me and I felt comfortable talking to.”\nAnother young person said: “I’m struggling to cope with bipolar. One minute, I feel so low, like I’m trapped, and all I want to do is disappear. Then suddenly, I feel the complete opposite, and I’m really happy and I start thinking about everything in a really positive light. I feel like I push away everyone that tries to help, I tell them I hate them and blame them for everything. I just feel like I’ve turned into a monster.”\nChildline founder Dame Esther Rantzen said: “It’s striking how many more children seem to be suffering serious mental health problems today than when we launched Childline 30 years ago.\n“So many desperately unhappy children seem to be suffering suicidal thoughts, self-harming, becoming anxious and depressed, with many of them turning to Childline because no other support is available.”\nRantzen said children’s mental health services are already “terribly overstretched” with young people unable to access the professional help they need.\nShe said: “We believe there needs to be far more emphasis on providing help for these children as they struggle to deal with what are very serious illnesses.”\nSarah Brennan, chief executive at the charity YoungMinds, agreed more support for young people was vital, especially from schools. \nShe said: “Young people face a huge range of pressures including stress at school, college, university, body image issues, bullying on and offline, around-the-clock social media and uncertain job prospects. \n“Difficult experiences in childhood including bereavement, domestic violence or neglect can also have a serious impact on mental health.”\nBrennan added: “As a society we need to do far more to prevent mental health problems from developing in the first place. To start with, we urgently need to rebalance our education system, so that schools are encouraged to prioritise well-being and not just exam results.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:29:12.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
