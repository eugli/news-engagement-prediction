Credit Chris Pietsch/Associated Press Several times this season, Northeastern forward Alex Murphy and Oregon guard Dylan Ennis have exchanged text messages and chatted via social media. After Ennis posted a highlights video of himself on Twitter last month, Murphy sent him a reply. “Keep killin’ and leading bro!” Murphy wrote. “Great to see you back out there doing your thing.” Despite going to colleges more than 3,000 miles apart and having started conversing only last summer, Murphy and Ennis have become friendly because of their shared experiences. Murphy, 24, and Ennis, 25, are both competing for their third colleges, are healthy after dealing with injuries last season and are rare players for whom the N.C.A.A. has granted a sixth year of eligibility. The N.C.A.A. allows Division I athletes to have five calendar years to play four seasons of competition, giving them a cushion in case they sustain an injury to have a redshirt year. The organization is strict about granting sixth years and does so only when colleges can prove players lost two seasons of participation because of reasons beyond their control, like injury or illness. The N.C.A.A. said it could not provide a tally for the total number of athletes who have received a sixth year. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Shortly after Ennis found out he was cleared for a sixth year on June 30, Murphy reached out to him and asked for advice on how to navigate the long process of applying for a sixth year. Ennis had followed a similar path, sending a message via Instagram to Northwestern State guard Jalan West after the N.C.A.A. granted West a sixth year in May. Ennis said West helped him deal with the uncertainty of waiting for the N.C.A.A. to make its decision, so he in turn wanted to encourage Murphy to have a positive attitude and submit the required paperwork in a detailed and timely manner. Continue reading the main story “I knew how hard it is to not know what your future holds,” Ennis said. “If he knew, ‘I just want to go pro,’ then that would have been great. But he knew he wanted to come back, but it was out of his control. I just wanted to do everything I could do to help him in that situation.” Continue reading the main story Photo Northeastern’s Alex Murphy, left, after a win over Connecticut on Nov. 14. Murphy, 24, reached out to Dylan Ennis at Oregon for advice on applying for his sixth year of eligibility. Credit Jessica Hill/Associated Press Murphy, a versatile 6-foot-8 forward, began his college career at Duke in 2011 as one of the top prospects in his class. But that fall, he sustained a concussion during a practice. When Murphy took a while to recover, the Blue Devils redshirted him. The next season, Murphy averaged only 6.3 minutes a game and played a total of four minutes in Duke’s three N.C.A.A. tournament games. His role remained limited early in the 2013-14 season, so he transferred after five games. “A lot of people now look back and they ask me, ‘Do you regret going to Duke or do you wish you would’ve done things differently?’” Murphy said. “I say, ‘Absolutely not.’” He added: “I think I grew up a lot during my two and a half years there. The things that I learned there definitely helped prepare me for what was coming in the future.” In December 2013, Murphy enrolled at Florida, where his older brother, Erik, had played. Per N.C.A.A. rules, Murphy had to sit out a year, so he could not return until the second semester of the 2014-15 season. By then, the Gators had their roles set, and Murphy averaged only 5.1 points in 14.2 minutes per game. Murphy expected to play more last season, but he injured his right foot during Florida’s first exhibition game. He later played briefly in three regular season games before injuring the foot again in early January and missing the rest of the season.

He also had a close relationship with Northeastern Coach Bill Coen, a longtime friend of Murphy’s father. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Still, there was no guarantee Murphy would ever play for Northeastern. He had seen other players be denied a sixth year. When the N.C.A.A. finally cleared Murphy in mid-September, he knew he was fortunate. “I appreciate every day when I step in here, the fact that I’m healthy, the fact that I can play this game,” said Murphy, who is averaging 14.2 points and a team-high 5.9 rebounds per game. “You can’t take that for granted at all.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
