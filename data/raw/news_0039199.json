But signing the contract obliges participation, if selected. \nNIT participation is not compulsory, and teams have elected to decline invitations in the recent past. Perhaps most notably, LSU chose not to play in the annual postseason tournament last March, after the Tigers — anchored by eventual No. 1 overall NBA draft pick Ben Simmons — failed to earn a place in the NCAA field. \nIndiana, however, intends to be involved, if invited. \nBracket projections for the second-tier competition are not as common as NCAA tournament forecasts. But two websites, DRatings.com and NYC Buckets, both currently project the Hoosiers as a No. 1 seed in the NIT field. Both forecasts were published before Wednesday’s loss to Minnesota. \nThe Hoosiers have not appeared in the NIT since 2005, when they lost a first-round home game against Vanderbilt. The last time Indiana was eligible for the NIT but not selected to the NCAA tournament field, in 2013-14, the Hoosiers finished the season 17-15 and did not receive a bid. \nFollowing the conclusion of that season, Indiana declined to play in any tertiary postseason tournaments, like the College Basketball Invitational. \nFollow IndyStar reporter Zach Osterman on Twitter: @ZachOsterman.
