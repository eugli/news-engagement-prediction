We are seriously working on that. \n“They are all from the Republic of Benin, they are non-Nigerians, they come to Nigeria to rob. \n“We are trying to make Nigeria a safe country because of the security situation in the country. \n“I am now calling for more synergy with other sister security agencies. \n“After leaving this place, they are going to be handed over to the police for prosecution,” he said. \nItems recovered from the suspects include a cut to size short gun among others. \nOne of the suspects, who denied any wrongdoing, said the gun found on him was being used as a member of a vigilante group from the area.
