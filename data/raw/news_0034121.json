SUPPLIED \nJustin Bieber, accused of battery, is set to perform one New Zealand show at Mt Smart Stadium in March. \nSources tell the outlet Bieber approached the guy and asked him to stop filming and delete the video footage, but when the man refused, the singer allegedly attacked him. \nREAD MORE: \nAnother restaurant worker reported the incident to cops, but Bieber had already left the premises by the time the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department officers arrived to look into the matter. \nThe alleged victim has reportedly declined to press charges, but the misdemeanour battery investigation is still ongoing. \nJustin's representatives have yet to comment on the rumoured altercation. \nIt's the latest legal issue for the 22-year-old, who had managed to stay out of trouble for over a year before Wednesday, when he was named in a police report regarding a fight in Cleveland, Ohio in 2016. \nCity authorities are investigating accusations the pop star allegedly assaulted a man after a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball play-off game. The incident was caught on camera, and the alleged victim claims he was hospitalised with various injuries, including a concussion. The investigation is still underway. Ad Feedback \nIt's possible a conviction could put a dent in Bieber's NZ travel plans, after rapper Chris Brown was denied a visa to come to New Zealand on the basis of previous convictions for violent crimes. \nAnother rapper, Young Thug, also pulled out of Laneway due to legal issues in the US, and Gaz from Geordie Shore was denied entry into New Zealand when his passport was too \"battered\" to be acceptable. \nOther musicians have been allowed into the country , despite convictions, however. \n- Stuff with Cover Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:07:18.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
