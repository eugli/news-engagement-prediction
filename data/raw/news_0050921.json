(Radio-Canada)\nThe previous government worked out the agreement with CN after the company came close to abandoning the line.\nThe clause that could put the line in jeopardy again comes into effect in 2019, when CN starts measuring the number of freight cars against 2012 levels.\nSince CN performs maintenance and upkeep on the track, Via Rail passenger service depends on CN to survive.\nFraser said the government has put together a committee to work on the issue. His department and Opportunities New Brunswick are also going to hire a fullâ€“time consultant to act as a liaison with CN.\nNorthern economy struggles Fraser identified economic struggles in northern New Brunswick as a major reason for declining freight traffic on the line.\n\"We've had some challenging times in the past years,\" he said. \"Things are starting to turn around and we're starting to make investments into infrastructure in our province.\"\nAdam Lordon, mayor of Miramichi, says rail is important to his community, and business people are trying to promote greater use of freight service. (Bridget Yard/CBC News)\nFraser said he's had conversations with the Port of Belledune, which relies on the rail line, and with CN and Via Rail.\nOther politicians are trying to drum up freight business and ensure the survival of passenger service in the area.\n\"The Chamber of Commerce has taken a leadership on this file for some time and is working with CN,\" said Miramichi Mayor Adam Lordon.\n\"The local peat moss industry is something that's been flagged in the past in terms of the CN volume. We think there are options and we're optimistic.\"\nBig hopes for Via service Fraser said he believes Via Rail is committed to expanding service through New Brunswick.\n\"The president of Via had said he'd like to bring in a daily service between Campbellton, Moncton, and eventually Halifax, as well,\" he said.\nBut Via Rail needs to deal with CN, whose priority is freight, not passengers, Fraser said.\nVia can't increase the frequency of its service unless the rail line steps up a class or two, which would allow trains to travel at an increased speed.\nThe last federal government spent $10.2 million on the line between Moncton and Campbellton, but the money went to upkeep, not improvements.\nWith files from Nicolas Steinbach", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:34:43.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
