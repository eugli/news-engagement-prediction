BSP, BJP and Congress secured just six, five and two respectively. One seat went to an Independent. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, SP had won only Kannauj and Mainpuri seats. For these elections, Akhilesh is banking on claims of having introduced big development projects like the Metro Rail in Lucknow, the Lucknow-Agra Expressway starting from Lucknow and connecting seven out of 12 districts going for polls in the third phase — including Hardoi, Unnao, Kanpur, Kannauj, Mainpuri and Etawah and several others. \nLIVE updates here: \n06:47 am: Third phase of voting in Uttar Pradesh will begin shortly. Final arrangements being carried out. \nContesting from Kannauj is his wife, Dimple Yadav, who has struck a chord with the people, addressing her as ‘Bhabhi’. She is now the star campaigner of the party, tagging along to grace the rallies of sister-in-law Aparna Yadav as well. \nLucknow is also the Lok Sabha constituency of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh . Etawah is the native place of SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav , while another key district is Mainpuri, from where Tej Pratap Yadav is an SP MP. A total of 826 candidates are in fray, whose fate will be decided by 2.41 crore voters, including 1.10 crore women and 1,026 belonging to third gender category. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:20:02.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
