You can kill a guy in a song and it's OK and I love that.\" Photos \nStars Get Ready for the 2017 Grammys \nUnderwood will also take the stage with Keith Urban , reuniting from their tour Down Under for \"The Fighter,\" a new song. \n\"It's just so much fun,\" she gushed. \"Kind of a dance-y type song that gets stuck in your head in a good way.\" \nUnderwood got to spend a lot of time with Urban and wife Nicole Kidman and praised his family-oriented mentality. \"He's such a nice guy,\" \"When we were shooting the video, Nicole stopped by, his daughters were there, they were in rehearsal the other day. It's nice to be around somebody like.\" \nThe key to the success? Making the effort, Underwood said, citing Urban's ability to know when it's time to step away for a second for family time. \nUnderwood, who has seven Grammys already and is also nominated for \"Little Toy Guns,\" took to the 2017 Grammys red carpet in designer Elie Madi . \n\"I usually don't do red, but I was feeling it,\" she said.
