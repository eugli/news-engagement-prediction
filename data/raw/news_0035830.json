And tense. \nDelegates rolled into the Macron stadium as the party’s attempts to snatch Labour votes in the north continued. \nChoosing Bolton as the venue was hardly surprising. Ukip has performed relatively well here in recent years. \nIt was a strange day. There appeared to be tears from leader Paul Nuttall after his predecessor was treated to a roar of applause from the party faithful. \nIt felt as though Nigel Farage was still in charge. \nComing onto the stage to thunderingly-powerful drum beats, his loyal followers were on their feet before he even said a word. \nHe piled pressure on his successor over the Stoke by-election, brazen in his attempts to steer the Ukip ship in his chosen direction. \nFarage warned that the crunch vote next week was ‘fundamental’ to Ukip’s future, insisting the party must remain ‘radical, or risk being ‘nothing’. Nigel Farage MEP pauses for thought as he addresses UKIP party members during the UKIP annual conference at the Macron Stadium \nJournalists - and party members, though they wouldn’t admit it - could instantly tell the former Ukip boss wasn’t entirely happy with the party’s plan for the future. \nFarage admitted there was a ‘big debate to be had’ about how the party moves forward. Whether his plan and Nuttall’s chime appears increasingly doubtful. \nThere’s no doubt Ukip is treading water after Brexit. Its focus was to secure - and winning - the EU referendum. \nA clear vision of what comes next is lacking. The speeches were big, but bombastic. There was little, if any, substance. \nNuttall appeared to wipe away tears as supporters showed their support. \nHis walk to the stage was almost Blair-esque, in musical choice if nothing else. \nThe Lightning Seeds’ scouse lyrics rang out around the hall: “Things could be marvellous.” \nIt was like D:Ream in 1997 all over again. \nMarred by this week’s reports about what he may or may not have said regarding his experiences of the Hillsborough disaster, Nuttall appeared at the end of his tether. \nHe hurled his speech at the crowd, insisting he would not let those who had spread ‘evil lies’ to ‘break’ him. \nIn the scenes as he left the stage, Nuttall dodged questions from the press before being bundled out of a side door. \nElsewhere, there were plenty of other bizarre goings on to keep punters entertained. \nA fringe event, entitled ‘Is Trump Right?’, was attended by a few intrigued journalists, who proceeded to be bombarded with ‘proof’ climate change is a myth. \nReporters never did find out the answer to the question. \nThe reality TV star-turned US president was highly popular at this particular debate. One attendee said he was a ‘visionary’, another a ‘man of the people’. \nThe usual purple merchandise was omnipresent…the rosettes, the tacky baseball caps, the devices that allow you to deliver leaflets through letter boxes without getting your fingers bitten off by a dog. All made in Britain, of course. \nBy noon, the ale was flowing as pies and pasties were gobbled up left, right and centre. \nThe bar was by far the most fascinating place to be. \n“If Scotland want to leave, let them,” one bloke barked at another. \n“We’ll rebuild Hadrian’s Wall. Just like Trump with his wall.” \nWhether this advice will become party policy - should Mr Nuttall romp home to victory next week and signal a Ukip revival in Westminster - remains to be seen.
