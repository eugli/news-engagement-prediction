This is the collateral damage of people who get involved in that lifestyle.\"\nThe Fentanyl Fix is a week long series exploring potential solutions to B.C.'s opioid overdose crisis. Arsenault and Steinkampf are with Odd Squad: a group of officers, retired officers and others who for years have reached out to kids with videos and presentations about the dangers of drug use.\nPrevention is one of the \"Four Pillars\" strategies employed in Vancouver to tackle drug addiction, but Arsenault and Steinkampf say of the four pillars, prevention is both the most important and the most overlooked.\nTake a walk through the Downtown Eastside with two members of the Odd Squad 1:14\n'Legalizers in sheep's clothing' When it comes to curbing drug addiction, Arsenault says there has been too much focus on harm reduction at the expense of prevention and long-term treatment.\n\"I don't support elements of harm reduction that are legalizers in sheep's clothing there,\" he said.\nArsenault says more resources should be going to the three other pillars: prevention in addition to enforcement and treatment.\nDrug users share ideas to fix fentanyl crisis But activist Wendy Pederson says it's not that simple.\n\"Understand there's other factors that are playing itself out in people's lives,\" she said. \"It's not just a personal choice.\"\nBut as the discussion over the fentanyl crisis continues, Arsenault sees a shift in the polarized nature of the debate.\nWhy pain education is linked to B.C.'s fentanyl crisis \"Now, I sense there is a change in the tide, from just doing triage,\" he said, referring to harm reduction.\n\"Instead of doing that, why not say what's causing the bombs to go off? Putting money at the front end is more cost effective.\"\nWith files from Peter Scobie", "external_links": ["http://vancouver.ca/people-programs/four-pillars-drug-strategy.aspx", "http://oddsquad.com/"], "published": "2017-02-02T01:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:02:51.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
