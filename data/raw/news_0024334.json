Country Living 6 hrs ago Jenae Sitzes The last thing anyone wants to find in their garden is a massive snake-especially if it seems to come out of nowhere.\nÂ© Provided by Country Living Can You Find the 6-Foot Snake Hiding In This Photo? Last Thursday, the Sunshine Coast Snack Catchers from Queensland, Australia shared this photo of six flower pots on Facebook, and encouraged followers to spot where the nearly six-foot-long carpet python was hiding. It may seem like an ordinary photo, but the image is a powerful warning for gardeners-even large snakes can hide in small areas and blend in with their surroundings.\nThankfully, carpet pythons are not venomous, and they're only found in mainland Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Yule Island, according to IFLScience . However, getting bitten by one is still unpleasant, and they're known to snatch up small pets in suburban areas.\nEven though carpet pythons may not be slithering around the U.S., but the photo is a good reminder to stay alert when heading outside this spring. You never know what critter might be lurking! And if you're still stumped by the photo above, you can see the python's location (it's in the top middle pot).\nClick to expand Replay Video Sweet Baby Disapproves of Dad's Singing We're not sure if this baby is unhappy about his dad's singing or because he's reached his first birthday, but it's clear that this is one disgruntled baby!
