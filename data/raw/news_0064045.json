But now experts are recommending ten portions of fruit and vegetables to ward off disease. This would prevent 7,200 cancer deaths and almost 14,000 from strokes every year, they claim. Researchers from Imperial College London found ten 80g portions of fruit and veg may cut the risk of cancer by 13 per cent and heart disease by 24 per cent. Lead author Dr Dagfinn Aune said: ‘Fruit and vegetables have been shown to reduce cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and to boost the health of our blood vessels and immune system. This may be due to the complex network of nutrients they hold. Experts are recommending ten portions of fruit and vegetables to ward off disease. This would prevent 7,200 cancer deaths and almost 14,000 from strokes every year, they claim ‘For instance they contain many antioxidants, which may reduce DNA damage, and lead to a reduction in cancer risk.’ He added: ‘I think people should try to do better than five if they can. There do seem to be benefits from a higher intake.’ The NHS is desperate to get people to eat their five-a-day, emphasising that fruit and vegetables can be juiced, canned or frozen. The UK average is four portions a day, with just a quarter of men aged 19 to 64 hitting the target, and 28 per cent of women. The researchers analysed data from 95 studies on fruit and vegetable intake, finding that ten servings cut the risk of dying prematurely by almost a third.
