The Women's Indigenous All Stars celebrate victory. Picture: Brett Costello Source: News Corp Australia \nThe halfback was named player of the match and caused plenty of headaches for the Women’s team. \nShe said the Women’s World Cup at the end of the year was definitely on her mind now. \n“I think after tonight, plenty of people have supported me and told me I can be there, so I think after tonight’s performance, I’m really happy with how I went,” Smith said. \n“If I stick hard at it and work my butt off and keep that as one goal I think I can get there in the World Cup team.” Rebecca Young leads the Women's Indigenous All Stars out at McDonald Jones Stadium, Newcastle. Picture: Brett Costello Source: News Corp Australia \nThe Indigenous team opened the scoring late in the second quarter after a run from Smith put them in a good position downfield. \nPlay had been held up for about five minutes after their second-rower Kandy Kennedy dislocated her kneecap. \nThe Indigenous women rallied once play resumed and scored on the next set of six. \nAfter Smith’s run, the ball ended up with centre Caitlin Moran on the left side. She put in a deep cross-field kick that bounced back in-goal over the head of Women’s halfback Maddie Studdon for Indigenous interchange Samantha Leisha to score. \nThey added to their total early in the third quarter then late in the fourth to finish with the 10-point win.

Picture: Brett Costello Source: News Corp Australia \nJillaroos and Indigenous back Moran was another standout, proving a handful in attack and defence. \nA decent crowd was treated to some entertaining football. \nThe stands had filled up by the second half, as plenty of fans arrived early for the double header and even the men’s Indigenous team braved the heat to watch the second stanza from the sideline.
