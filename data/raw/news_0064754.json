The bill passed by the Republican-controlled legislature would have barred the state from providing funds to clinics that perform abortions not covered by Medicaid, the federal healthcare program for the poor.\nMcAuliffe, a Democrat, said the measure would harm thousands of Virginians who relied on Planned Parenthood healthcare services and programs. He vetoed a similar measure last year.\n\"Attempts to restrict womenâ€™s access to health care will impede the goal of making Virginia the best place to live, work, and run a business,\" he said in a statement.\nAdvocates for the law had said it would underpin organizations that provide the widest range of services.\nPlanned Parenthood draws the ire of many Republicans because it provides abortions. Republican President Donald Trump has pledged to defund the organization.\n(Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:17:11.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
