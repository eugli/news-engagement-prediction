REUTERS/Michael Dalder (GERMANY - Tags: SPORT SOCCER) \nFormer England and Chelsea midfield star Frank Lampard said he was retiring Thursday at the age of 38 after turning down \"a number of exciting offers\" in Britain and abroad. \n\"After 21 incredible years I have decided that now is the right time to finish my career as a professional footballer,\" Lampard, Chelsea's record goalscorer, wrote on Facebook. \n\"I'm immensely proud of the trophies I've won, of representing my country over 100 times and of scoring more than 300 career goals.\" \nLampard did not say what he plans to do next, but said he was grateful to the Football Association for the opportunity to do his coaching badges, suggesting he may go into management. \nLampard left New York City FC in the autumn and also played for West Ham United and Manchester City in the Premier League. \nBut it was at Stamford Bridge where he really made his name as a prolific midfielder.

It is impossible to give thanks individually to all the people that helped and supported me in my 13 years playing there. \n\"All I can say is from the day I signed until now and going forward, I'm eternally grateful for everything and to everyone. Chelsea fans gave myself and my teammates such incredible support. \n\"Their passion and hunger drove me on personally to give my best year after year. I couldn't have done it without them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T16:26:07.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
