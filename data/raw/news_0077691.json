Science fiction and fantasy movies haven't always fared well at the Academy Awards, but within minutes of each other, Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them won Oscars for makeup and costume design, respectively. \nThese are big — and confusing — wins for Warner Bros. and fans of both DC's comic books and Harry Potter. \n— Elisabeth Joffe (@elisabethjoffe) February 27, 2017 SUICIDE SQUAD for makeup and FANTASTIC BEASTS for costume - big night at the #Oscars for looks u can now buy at HOT TOPIC. \n— MAX IM A KOOPA (@meakoopa) February 27, 2017 I thought Academy Award winner #SuicideSquad was enjoyable.... \n— Joe Moses (@thejoemoses) February 27, 2017 I just knew this whole night was going to be about Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts.
