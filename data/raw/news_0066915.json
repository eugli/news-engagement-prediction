The casting director saw my tape and told [ Moonlight director] Barry Jenkins about me. I didn’t get the part in Star Trek, but that’s why Barry reached out to me. And the rest is history.” \nOn her love for the stories of Moonlight and Hidden Figures : “I love telling these sorts of stories that give voice to those who are oftentimes uncelebrated, to those who don’t feel like they have a voice in America. These are characters who are considered to be outcast in society because of their sexual identity, gender, or race. I think that these two movies have opened up a new door to the possibilities of telling more unique stories.” \nOn her decision to wear black and white: “I just try to remain humble, remain myself. Early on in my career I decided I was going to wear black and white, a kind of uniform, to honor and pay homage to my working-class parents [who wore uniforms every day to work]. I’m so proud to be from Wyandotte County, one of the poorest counties in Kansas. I’m so happy that I serve as a reminder of that. You know, there is a quote that says you don’t have to be a part of your environment, but your environment can be a part of you. I’m in Hollywood but I’m not of it. I love just remaining an artist.” \nAlso pictured: Janelle and Ellie Bamber attending Los Angeles Confidential magazine and CÎROC Ultra-Premium Vodka’s celebration of of the Spring Oscars issue with Janelle Monáe at Palihouse West Hollywood on Wednesday (February 22) in West Hollywood. \nFor more from Janelle , visit LAConfidentialMagazine.com !
