But they said they talk about how to improve work life balance as they've been required to travel more since they became Fixer Upper stars and expanded into furniture, rugs, pillows, throws, paint and publishing. \nJoanna spoke of her love of New York in a session with The Dallas Morning News. \nPeople magazine reported late Tuesday that the Gaineses said in another interview session that they have considered moving from Waco for a time. \n\"We talk about it. We've been to Kansas City a lot recently and have just fallen in love with that community,\" Chip told People . \"Salt Lake, every time we go there it just kind of really inspires us, obviously New York City for Jo. There are a few cities across the country that we would possibly consider if Waco did not work out.\" \nChip said to People , \"Las Vegas would be fun.\" \nJoanna said, \"New York City, I think would be fun.\" \nJoanna said to The Dallas Morning News that she has always loved New York City and says she finds inspiration from the small boutiques and large stores such as ABC Carpet and Home. \n\"Anytime I have a chance to go back...I love it. I draw inspiration from it,\" Joanna said. \"We even went there for our honeymoon.\" \nChip confirmed her feelings saying \"we go floor by floor when we're in ABC Carpet and Home.\" \n\"I'm opposite,\" Chip said. \"For me it's about waking up in the morning and messing with the animals.\" The Gaineses live on a 40-acre farm with goats and chickens and lots of other animals.

She was a broadcast journalism major at Baylor University. \n\"I was so homesick I would go to these small boutiques that felt like home,\" Joanna said. \"When I came back this whole thing of design kind of developed in my heart as a dream.\" \n\"I wanted to create that same experience for other people, to come into my store and stay and linger,\" she said. \"I couldn't afford anything. I loved the candles, fresh flowers and the music.\" \nTwitter: @MariaHalkias", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:15:18.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
