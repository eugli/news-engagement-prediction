President Donald Trump \n\"The government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States,\" the judges' ruling in the 9th Circuit court said Thursday. \nYet the majority of people killed in domestic terrorist attacks were killed by Saudis. \nThe seven targeted countries are mostly ravaged by poverty and, in some cases, civil war. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia ranks among the 15 richest countries in the world. Here's what's happened \nThe White House has been tightlipped about the alleged arms deal, but unnamed government officials involved directly in the reported deal told the Washington Times Tuesday that a major sale of arms to Saudi Arabia was imminent. \nSaudi Arabia is reportedly set to buy a $300 million precision-guided missile technology package from the United States — a deal confirmed by anonymous Congressional sources. \n\"These are significant sales for key allies in the Gulf who are facing the threat from Iran and who can contribute to the fight against the Islamic State,\" one of the officials said to the Washington Times .

Source: Pool/Getty Images Here's why it matters \nSaudi terrorists have been responsible for the vast majority of people who have died in terrorist attacks committed on U.S. soil. \nBetween 1975 and 2015, there have been 40 successful terrorists on U.S. soil, according to the think tank Cato Institute . Nineteen of those were responsible for executing 9/11, 15 of whom were from Saudi Arabia . \nWith 2,983 deaths from 9/11, the 15 Saudi nationals killed an average of 2,355 people. However, the remaining 25 terrorists over the 40 year period were collectively responsible for a an average of 669 deaths. WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 04: U.S. President Barack Obama looks on as King Salman bin Abd alAziz of Saudi Arabia speaks during a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office of the White House September 4, 2015 in Washington, D.C.

Their missile attacks and military involvement against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have made Saudi partly responsible for the carnage and displacement of millions of people in Syria. \nSupporting and encouraging Saudi Arabia's military might has major implications for the world and regional stability — that means it unavoidably has implications for national security too.
