Credit: PA \nMore than 20,000 allegations of abuse by care home workers against the elderly and vulnerable have been made in the last three years, figures show. \nOf the claims: More than 3,000 were of physical abuse 2,400 were of psychological abuse 400 were of sexual abuse \nThe vast majority related to the care of elderly people in their homes, most aged over 80. \nThe figures were obtained by a BBC File on 4 investigation under the Freedom of Information Act. \nThe report revealed how some elderly people were left for days without proper medication or attention to personal hygiene. \nBridget Warr, chief executive of the UK Home Care Association, which represents care companies in the UK, described the findings as \"horrifying\" and blamed cuts to local Government budgets. \nLocal Government Ombudsman Michael King said there was a growing problem over standards of home care. \nOmbudsman complaints about home care rose by 25% last year to 372 - and 65% of them were upheld. \nThe Department of Health told File on 4 it has \"introduced tougher inspections of care services, given councils access to up to Â£7.6bn of dedicated funding for social care and will continue to challenge local authorities that do not fulfil their duties under the Care Act\". \nOnly half the councils contacted in England, Scotland, Wales and NI provided data, suggesting the true number of allegations could be far higher.
