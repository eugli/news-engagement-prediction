The other accused in the case are Sasikala's relatives VN Sudhakaran and Elavarasi. All four had been convicted by the trial court, but acquitted by the Karnataka High Court. \nNearly a month after her aunt and former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa died, Deepa Jayakumar declared her intentions to enter politics. \n42-year-old Deepa is the daughter of Jayalalithaa's only brother late Jayakumar. \nLondon-educated Deepa first shot into limelight when she alleged that she was not allowed to meet her aunt Jayalalithaa when she was hospitalised for 75 days. Later, she also alleged that she was not allowed to attend Jayalalithaa's funeral in December.
