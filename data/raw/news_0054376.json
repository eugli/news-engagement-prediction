Erika Laird.\n'He belongs to the officer now'\nThe owner told police he could not provide the care the puppy, named Carl, would require.\n\"The owner came to the conclusion that he would not be able to continue caring for the dog with those injuries that he had sustained,\" Laird said.\nAt that moment one of the responding officers decided to adopt the injured animal and rush it to the nearest veterinary clinic.\n\"The owner of the dog actually transferred ownership of the puppy over to one of the responding officers â€¦ he belongs to the officer now.\"\nA man arrested shortly after officers arrived was charged with possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose and two counts of injuring an animal. He is due in court March 3.\nOnce the puppy is released from the veterinary clinic, it will return home with the officer.\n\"We know for sure he has survived the surgery,\" Laird said. \"He's still in the care of the veterinary clinic while he recovers and he's ready to go home.\"\nFort McKay is about 55 km north of Fort McMurray.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:43:14.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
