Like its iOS cousin, EasilyDo’s Email app promises the same lightning speed, simple one-tap unsubscribing to junk mail, smart sorting for things like package tracking and flights, and swipe-based inbox triage tools that the sadly deceased Mailbox made popular. \nWhile Android doesn’t have quite the same issue with email apps that iOS does with Apple’s lackluster Gmail support in the bundled Mail app, Email by EasilyDo is still a great app if you’re looking for a change from Google’s own email app. Since its original introduction last year, EasilyDo has kept Email updated with support for Yahoo, Outlook, AOL, and other IMAP accounts, making it helpful if you’re looking for a universal inbox. Even if you’re not, its sheer speed when it comes to search and unsubscribing makes it at least worth a try. \nEmail by EasilyDo is available now on the Play Store .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:01:20.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
