The problem is, Justin Timberlake just gave an interview dissing his former bandmates, so he'll probably only get involved if there are no strings attached. SEE ALSO: Katy Perry's 'Chained to the Rhythm' is cotton candy political pop \n\"I felt like I cared more about the music than some of the other people in the group,\" he told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published last week. \"I felt like I had other music I wanted to make and that I needed to follow my heart.\" A post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake) on Feb 8, 2017 at 1:07pm PST \nTimberlake recently wrapped up a role in Woody Allen's Wonder Wheel , a 1950s period drama opposite Kate Winslet, and will likely be devoting a good chunk of time campaigning for the next awards season. \nTimberlake would probably really like to win an Oscar and almost certainly won't this year, although he is nominated. Between two La La Land songs and Lin Manuel-Miranda's Moana contender, \"Can't Stop the Feeling\" from Trolls, though mercilessly catchy, doesn't have much of a shot. \nIf he's focusing on being a serious actor, he probably doesn't want to gather up the old gang to sing the memeified \"It's Gonna Be Me.\" \nBut Timberlake has to be careful with public opinion, too — he's aiming to be seen as a an artist, not the jerk who ruined everyone's fun. Likability is Timberlake's strongest asset as an actor, and he'll be aiming to charm his way to the top. \nThe best thing for him to do is show up for one special performance. The VMAs might seem like an obvious choice — the timing would be right in late August — but they've already done that. \nThey joined forces to honor Timberlake himself, who picked up the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award — honoring Justin Timberlake is a great way to get Justin Timberlake on board. \nBass did reveal that they'll be getting a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, so perhaps a very special Los Angeles concert is in the cards. \n\"We'll all be there! We just have to decide on a date. We're terrible at planning things,\" Bass told ET. \"We're five guys, so for us to make a decision about anything is really hard, so we just need to do it. So hopefully maybe around Christmas time. It'll be fun to see everybody again.\" \nBass says they'll be releasing their 1998 album, Home For Christmas on vinyl, so the whole thing seems more like a pretty good marketing scheme for the perfect nostalgic Christmas gift for millenials than a legitimate reunion. \nKeep your expectations low. But getting these guys back together in puffer vests and turtlenecks for some holiday cheer, even just temporarily? That's still music to our ears. \nThanks for the memories, dudes.
