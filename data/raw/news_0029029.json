Owners Donna Grandy and her daughter Jody Bissonnette have another specialty: cakes with Braille lettering ($35 and up). Grandy was first inspired to create the confections when a customer wanted a birthday cake for her blind grandson. The baker contacted a local recreation center for the blind, which gave her a Braille alphabet chart to follow. She experimented with icing and fondant, but found that melting chocolate in a rectangular mold, allowing it to harden, and then adding the chocolate raised dots worked best. “It’s like a big Hershey’s bar,” says Bissonnette; it can be removed when it’s time to cut the cake. Orders were infrequent until last November, when they reached out to the National Braille Press in Boston. The nonprofit posted a photo of the shop’s Braille cake on its Facebook page. “We used to advertise in the Yellow Pages, but people didn’t pick up on what we did,” says Grandy. In three weeks, Donna’s sold five cakes. One of her proudest moments, Grandy says, was a Braille cake she created that said “Happy 90th Birthday Dad.” “In 90 years, he was never before able to read his own cake.” Donna’s Cakes, 100 Spring St., West Roxbury, 617-327-5916, www.donnas-cakes.com .\nANN TRIEGER KURLAND\nAnn Trieger Kurland can be reached at atrieger@comcast.net .", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ffood-dining%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fhow-you-spell-happy-birthday-braille%2FssOON4RYOrj6stub9iyT9H%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&media=//c.o0bg.com/rw/Boston/2011-2020/2017/01/19/BostonGlobe.com/Lifestyle/Images/turner011917FOODxxbraille17.jpg&description=How", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ffood-dining%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fhow-you-spell-happy-birthday-braille%2FssOON4RYOrj6stub9iyT9H%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=How", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ffood-dining%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fhow-you-spell-happy-birthday-braille%2FssOON4RYOrj6stub9iyT9H%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=How", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ffood-dining%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fhow-you-spell-happy-birthday-braille%2FssOON4RYOrj6stub9iyT9H%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tHow"], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T14:28:21.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
