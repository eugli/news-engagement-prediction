Hundreds of strangers attend funeral of homeless army veteran \nSam stays out of the house when she can. \nShe often stays with friends – although it’s quickly becoming clear that the warm welcome initially offered by their parents’ is growing cold and inconvenient. \nHer request to sleep over at a pal’s house is refused via WhatsApp. \nUnsafe at home, unable to stay at a friend’s house and at the end of a bus route, Sam sends out a plea on Twitter desperate for somebody get back to her before her phone battery runs out. \nSadly she only receives two responses, one from a concerned friend who’s currently out of town. \nAnd another, from a man she’s clearly been trying to ignore. \nSo, if Sam wants a bed for the night, she must choose between a violent abuser at home and a guy she doesn’t want to sleep with or face a night on the streets. Sam soon feels like she’s outstayed her welcome (Picture: Centrepoint) Sam puts out a plea on Twitter (Picture: Centrepoint) \nSam’s story is fiction, but it is based on the reality of people Centrepoint work with every day. \nResearch conducted by the youth homelessness charity provides a startling look at the decisions vulnerable young people face to avoid sleeping rough. Youth homelessness statistics \n26% of homeless young people have stayed with a stranger. \n12% have committed a crime to be taken into custody to avoid freezing to death. \n9% have attempted to admit themselves in to A&E. \n59% of young people left home following a family breakdown. \nMore than 150,000 young people a year across the UK approach their local councils for help with housing, with a third are turned away without meaningful support. Sam is faced by difficult decisions if she wants to stay off the streets (Picture: Centrepoint) \nThe Centrepoint Helpline – the first ever advice service for young people who are either homeless or at risk of homelessness – was launched this week by HRH The Duke of Cambridge, the charity’s Patron. \nPeople between 16-25 are encouraged to call 0808 800 0661 for free and confidential advice about homelessness.
