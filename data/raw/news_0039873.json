Liam Neeson and Thomas Brodie-Sangster (aka Daniel and Same) were spotted filming in London (Picture: WENN.com) The filming took place on the same bench from the 2003 romcom (Picture: Photo by Peter Mountain/Universal/Dna/REX/Shutterstock) THE FEELS (Picture: WENN.com) And what happened to Daniel and Claudia Schiffer? (Picture: WENN.com) \nBut Sam revealed *on that bench* that the problem was he was in love – but she didn’t even know he existed. \nCue attention-seeking drum playing, which *spoiler alert* led to Joanna (his crush) noticing him at the school Christmas concert. \nAnd Joanna (aka Sam’s love interest with that *amazing* voice) was also spotted on-set – which hopefully means that the Transatlantic love story kept going. \nIt’s only been a few days since writer and director Richard Curtis broke the amazing news that the smash-hit would return for a reunion on Red Nose Day , in a special called Red Nose Day Actually. \nHe said: ‘Over the years I’ve enjoyed doing Red Nose Day specials on TV things I’ve worked on – Blackadder, The Vicar of Dibley, and Mr Bean. Olivia Olsen, who played Joanna aged 11, was also spotted on set (Picture: WENN.com) Will their Transatlantic love blossom? (Picture: WENN.com) \n‘It seemed like a fun idea this year to do a special sketch based on one of my films, since Red Nose Day is now both in the UK and America. \n‘I would never have dreamt of writing a sequel to Love Actually, but I thought it might be fun to do ten minutes to see what everyone is now up to.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:30:02.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
