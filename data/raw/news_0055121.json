Are you one of the millions of Americans sporting one of these 100 most common surnames from the 1990 federal census? Our list of the top commonly occurring U.S. surnames includes details on each surname's popularity, plus its origin, meaning, and even common alternate spellings. Did your name make this list of most popular surnames in the United States? Most Common US Surnames by Rank Rank \n\n\nSince personal census data less than 72 years old is protected by confidentiality, names are not even entered into the databases that the U.S. Census Bureau uses to tabulate statistics in various categories. For this reason, a surname study across the entire census population is not possible. Thus, this list of the most common surnames from the 1990 census was created by the U.S. Census Bureau from a sampling of 7.2 million census records gathered as part of an independent post-enumeration study conducted in the summer of 1990 . \nWhy is this important? For the most common US surnames, the estimated population percentages from the sampling probably reflect the population at large with a fairly high degree of accuracy. However, the survey intentionally over sampled both Blacks and Hispanics, so certain surnames such as Garcia, Rodriguez, Gomez, and Washington may be over-represented. Because the sample involved certain regional areas, it is also possible that some less-common surnames made their way onto the list because of a large percentage of family members with a less-common surname happened to live within one of the areas studied. Thus, this list is not an entirely accurate representation of the U.S. population in 1990 as a whole, although it is likely to be generally close. Either way, it's fun information!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:30:20.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
