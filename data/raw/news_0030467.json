Allen’s word moves the Irish past Miami, and this 2018 class only trails Penn State at this point in the cycle. \nThe 6-foot-1, 205-pound Allen has already been selected to play in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl and the Marietta (Ga.) Lassiter standout is a game-changer in all three facets of the game on the prep level. He has an elite skill set as a safety and the long-standing relationship with new ND defensive coordinator Mike Elko and the scheme they'll play in South Bend had a huge impact on this commitment. \nAs Notre Dame moves to a 4-2-5 defense, Allen brings a skill set that allows him roam around and make plays as a high safety, he can certainly roll down and don't rule him out at cornerback. He's played three years of corner on the prep level, he's instinctual, fluid and a tone-setter when he arrives at the football. Other offers included Alabama, Clemson, Georgia and Ohio State. \n\"The biggest thing I would say about Derrik and I have to be honest, it's something his father and I talked about a lot with Derrik coming in as a freshman, he was already a big kid, 5-11, somewhere in that range, and we knew he was going to be a big kid,\" Allen's position coach Cedric Dickerson said. \"It was about keeping him loose. As you see kids grow larger, get stiff, tight in the hips, Derrik is a big kid who's played a lot of corner so moving inside in college is going to give him an advantage guarding the bigger spread tight ends and slot receivers. More than anything he has the size to fill the alley and the ability to cover.\" \nWhat Notre Dame brings off the field sealed the deal for Allen. \n\"The biggest thing he's getting is a quality education,\" Dickerson said. \"Derrik really wants to start his own business after football so the education at Notre Dame was something that piqued his interest.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:55:00.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
