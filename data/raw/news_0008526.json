(Source: supplied) \nSydney fashion startup InStitchu has opened a physical store in the heart of New York City as its first presence outside of Australia and New Zealand. \nInStitchu is a five-year-old online business that allows customers to send in their measurements to have custom-made suits and shirts delivered in 3 to 4 weeks. The success of the venture had seen it open showrooms in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra and Auckland. \nCo-founder Robin McGowan said that the startup already had a “significant number” of US customers but a physical presence was the “logical next step” for a fashion business. \n“We have had US customers ordering online for years, but some shoppers — predominantly wedding groups — have the desire to feel the fabric and talk to a real person before purchasing,” he said. \n“We have enjoyed a warm welcome from locals and the extremely supportive Australian community in NYC.” \nInStitchu was turning over $10 million by last year and claims its average customer re-orders every 120 days and that such repeat business accounts for the majority of its orders.

Ordering their own suits soon turned into a business for other people and they ended up quitting their day jobs at CBRE and Macquarie. \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
