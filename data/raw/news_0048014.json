Ms Huffington has been on Uber’s board since April last year. Also conducting the review will be Uber’s new head of human resources, Liane Hornsey, and Angela Padilla, Uber’s associate general counsel.\nDiversity figures\nAfter coming into widespread criticism for never having published statistics on diversity at the company, Mr Kalanick said he would deliver figures in the \"coming months\". He said that of the employees working as engineers, product managers or data scientists, 15.1% are women - a number which he said hadn’t changed significantly in the past year.\n“As points of reference,” he wrote, “Facebook is at 17%, Google at 18% and Twitter at 10%.”\nUntil now, Uber had been standing firm on not publishing its diversity figures. Most major technology companies make public their EEO-1 - a government filing that breaks down employees by race, religion, gender and other factors.\nClick to see content: elephantvalleyharassment Uber has not specified if it will publish its entire EEO-1, or just post select figures from the company.\nIn her blog post, Susan Fowler cited anecdotal figures of women leaving Uber in droves.\nSpeaking specifically about the site reliability engineering team, which she worked on for a year, she said that by the time she left, “out of over 150 engineers in the SRE teams, only 3% were women”. She now works at San Francisco-based payment firm Stripe.\nUber said it would be holding an “all hands\" meeting on Tuesday to tell its employees what its “next steps” will be.\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook .\nIf you are an Uber employee, you can reach Dave directly and anonymously on encrypted messaging app Signal using +1 (628) 400-7370.", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/daveleebbc", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/A7F2/production/_94749924_whatsubject.jpg", "http://facebook.com/daveleebbc", "https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber"], "published": "2017-02-21T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:09:43.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
