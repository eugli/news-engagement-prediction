P!nk After Lady Gaga ’s Super Bowl halftime performance silenced every Super Bowl halftime and Gaga critic ever, you’d think there wouldn’t be much else to say on the matter, as mother monster let her performance do the talking like she always has. Sadly, there were apparently fans of fellow rebellious pop artist, P!nk , who thought Gaga may have borrowed the “Just Give Me A Reason” singer’s trademark acrobat performance with her own aerial high-wire stunt during the halftime show on Sunday night. Thankfully, P!nk has spoken up to downplay any negative vibes being aimed towards Gaga, taking to Instagram to say, “squash this before it even has a chance to become a thing.” “Her voice was powerful,” P!ink continued in the post, which can be seen below. “Her outfits were on point, choreography stellar, her heart was in it and she sang about love and inclusiveness, all in front of millions of people. Let’s celebrate a woman who has the guts to jump off a roof and stand up there in the first place.” She also made sure to use hashtags, #WomenSupportingWomen and #LetsNotGetDistracted, because really everybody, there are more important things going on in the world at the moment where people don’t need to be gossiping about this women against women nonsense. \nIt was Gaga herself that sung it best in her duet with Florence Welch on Joanne ’s “Hey Girl” in saying, “Hey girl/We can make it easy if we lift each other/Hey girl/We don't need to keep on one-in' up another.” \nBesides, Cirque and Peter Pan have been in the air for years! So come on you guys, quit trying to pit the strongest women in the music industry against each other!
