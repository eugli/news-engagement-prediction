'Lots of anger' \nHowever, responding to a point of order in the Commons on Monday, Mr Bercow said he was opposed to the president addressing both Houses of Parliament - as other international leaders have done. European diplomats uncertain about US \nHe said addressing Parliament was \"not an automatic right\", but an \"earned honour\" for foreign leaders. \n\"I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons,\" he told MPs. \nHis comments were applauded by opposition MPs in the Commons. \nHowever, senior Conservatives have rounded on the speaker's comments. \nOne Tory MP and former Cabinet member told the BBC that Mr Bercow must be close to standing down, while another said his comments went \"way beyond what is acceptable\". \nAnother said it was an embarrassment to the Commons and had caused a lot of anger. Image copyright PA Image caption Theresa May said the Queen had invited Donald Trump to the UK \nCrispin Blunt, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said Mr Bercow was going to have to deal with \"the consequences\" of his comments. \nMr Blunt said there were \"strongly held views on both sides of the argument\", but added: \"Generally the speaker, who's meant to referee all of this, should keep himself above that. \n\"I think that's to be regretted. But it is a symptom of the controversy around this visit.\" \nThe Lords' Speaker, Tory former Cabinet minister Lord Fowler, will make his own statement on the issue to peers later. Churchill bust \nRepublican Congressman Joe Wilson criticised the Speaker's comments, telling the BBC's Newsnight programme his interjection was \"very disappointing\". \n\"If ever in recent years there's been a more pro-British president of the United States, it's Donald Trump,\" he said. \nHe said President Trump had already assured Mrs May over his commitment to Nato, expressed a desire to create UK-US trade relationships, and returned a bust of Winston Churchill to the Oval Office. \n\"I consider it too, sadly, a slap at the Republican Party. It was the leaders of our party that actually placed the bust of Winston Churchill in the US Capitol Building and we urge all persons to come visit our Capitol Building,\" he added.
