Don’t believe it and please don’t share fake information,” he said.    \nKim Jong-nam, the half-brother of Jong-un, was killed after two women wiped his face with the banned VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 on Feb 13. He was waiting to board a flight to Macau.\nMalaysia is waiting for the next of kin to identify the body and provide DNA samples for identity confirmation. \nHowever, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam said there  were other ways should no next-of-kin come forward to claim Jong-nam’s body or provide a DNA sample. \n“These include dental profiling and examining the body for identifying marks,\" he said on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:28:50.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
