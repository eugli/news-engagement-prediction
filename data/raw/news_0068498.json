On Wednesday, after news broke that Trump had lifted Obama's Title IX guidance on transgender students, celebrities bashed the president's decision and offered support to the transgender community. Obama's guidance interpreted Title IX, a federal law banning discrimination based on sex in public schools, to include gender identity, to ensure that transgender students have equal access to school amenities. Ellen DeGeneres said that having these protections in place for trans students was \"about human rights\" and \"isn't about politics\" very shortly after the news broke. \nJust seeing the news about removing laws protecting trans people. This isn't about politics. It's about human rights, and it's not okay. \nFor anyone who feels scared or hopeless, know that we will never stop fighting for your rights. Jazz Jennings, out trans teen and model for the world's first transgender doll , shared a video message from her and her mother discussing Trump's move. \"I just wanted to say that, as a transgender teenager, I was deeply affected by the Trump administration's plan to revoke Obama's directive that was trans-inclusive towards kids like myself within schools,\" Jennings said. \nTo my trans community, stay hopeful and stand united! #ProtectTransKids https://t.co/HWRsN5hwbm Actress Laverne Cox, who shouted out transgender teen student Gavin Grimm and his Supreme Court case at the Grammys , also shared a few stills on Instagram of her speaking about transgender access in public spaces. \" #ProtectTransKids #StandWithGavin Trans people have a right to exist in public space with equal access,\" she wrote in her Instagram caption. \" #TransIsBeautiful #TransRightsAreHumanRights #TransLivesMatter \" Author Janet Mock shared a lengthy story on her Instagram about her own struggles with restroom access during high school and how finding support made all the difference in her own life. \"You deserve equal access, affirmation and an education, and you must recognize that you are powerful,\" Mock wrote. Several other celebrities weighed in on Trump's controversial move, as well. \nTrans friend, if you are struggling tonight, please reach out to @TrevorProject and @Translifeline. Equality for all! #ISTANDWITHGAVIN \nTrans kids drop out of school &amp; commit suicide b/c of bullying. Now we can add the Secretary of Education and President 2 list of bullies. \nOh yeah! Because #trans students are the REAL threat. Jesus. #LGBT #LGBTQ #wtf @BetsyDeVosED @jeffsessions https://t.co/pAuKNl17we \nFuck this https://t.co/DHKh3AfQoU \nwe must #ProtectTransKids. this administration is attacking disenfranchised communities one by one. we must stand together for what's right. https://t.co/zbCIoMZKRi \ntrans kids lives now in danger after a very short sense of false security. THE BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS, TRUMP SUPPORTERS. WAKE THE FUCK UP \n@realDonaldTrump: no young person should wake up in the morning fearful of the school day ahead. We must #ProtectTransKids \nTo the LGBTQ community, I'm sorry for the message that was sent today. They don't speak for all of us. We love you. \nTrans kids: You are LOVED, SUPPORTED, and VALID.

Fight and #resist #equality #athleteally @athleteally @HRC https://t.co/Ar0E67yqyJ \nTrans rights are human rights. The end! ?? #ProtectTransKids A previous tweet from Trump went viral on Wednesday night. People began to retweet a campaign season message from Trump to show how he's flip-flopped on his promises to the LGBTQ community. \nThank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs. \"I will fight for you,\" Trump wrote, as he bashed Hillary Clinton . With Wednesday's news, he seems to have given up that fight rather quickly.
