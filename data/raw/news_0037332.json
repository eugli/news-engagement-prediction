Rand Paul (R-Ky.) weighed many of their ideas, but wasn’t having it. \nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) left before it was over, having heard enough of a conversation that he says centers around keeping Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion intact and creating tax credits that he called a “new entitlement program,” though a Republican in the room rebutted the notion that the topic of Medicaid expansion came up in the Tuesday meeting with Ryan. \n“I hear things that are unacceptable to me,” Paul said in an interview afterward. “If they don’t seem to care what conservatives think about complete repeal of Obamacare, they’re going to be shocked when they count the votes.” \nPaul has been on the front lines of coming up with a repeal plan for the Affordable Care Act, saying that the Republicans should essentially blitzkrieg Obamacare and replace it immediately . President Donald Trump, who has been somewhat nebulous about how to tackle the problem of Obamacare specifically has communicated with Paul specifically, and agrees with Paul’s plan on how to go about doing it. \nPaul has been vocally adamant about his resistance to any Republican budgets that increase the debt and expand entitlements, as he demonstrated by giving a 20 minute presentation on the senate floor when Republicans submitted their “vehicle for repealing Obamacare” budget that would add $10 trillion to the debt. \nWith things staying the same despite the changes in power, it’s little surprise that Paul was willing to leave.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:45:02.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
