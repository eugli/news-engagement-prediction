God, I love Moonlight so much. I am so excited for Moonlight ,” the 28-year-old said. “And of course, it was an amazing thing to hear La La Land. I think we all would have loved to win Best Picture, but we are so excited for Moonlight. I think it is one of the best films of all time, so I was pretty beside myself.” Beatty explained onstage that the mishap happened because he and Dunaway were handed the wrong envelope. Instead of the Best Picture envelope, they were given Best Actress. “I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, La La Land ,” he said. “That’s why I looked at Faye, and at you. I wasn’t trying to be funny.” \nStone said backstage that she was still holding the winner card for her category and was confused by Beatty’s explanation. \nRELATED: 'Moonlight' Is Best Picture at Oscars After Faye Dunaway Mistakenly Calls 'La La Land' Winner “I also was holding my Best Actress in a Leading Role card that entire time -- I don’t mean to start stuff -- but whatever story that was, I had that card, so I am not sure what happened,” she said. Though the La La Land crew was forced to leave the stage and give back their Oscars, after they were already deep into their acceptance speeches, Stone admitted they're still wrapping their heads around what happened. “I think everyone is in a state of confusion still -- excitement but confusion,” Stone said of the atmosphere afterward, before doubling down on her admiration for Moonlight . “I think everyone is just so excited for Moonlight . It is such an incredible film.” \nStone’s stunned reaction moments before the Oscars admitted that they had crowned the wrong Best Picture winner was shared all over the internet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:14:21.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
