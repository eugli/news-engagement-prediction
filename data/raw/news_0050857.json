Nyet.\" \nPolice blocked off streets as the group marched to the White House, chanting as it went. But it got only as far as far as the fences blocking off the section of Lafayette Park in front of the White House, behind which work crews were taking down the pavilion from which Trump watched the inaugural parade last month. \n\"Shame! Shame!\" the rally-goers chanted. \n\"We have been doing this every weekend,\" said Morgan Mullins, 24, of Washington. \"We'll keep doing this as long as we have to.\" \nGayle Fleming, 69, said the rally reminded her of the days when she protested the Vietnam War. She said Trump may have inadvertently spawned a new generation of political activists. \n\"What I'm seeing, especially being as old as I am, is the amazing interest of people who have never been activists,\" she said. \"This does inspire us. It's the silver lining in the middle of all this horrible stuff.\" \nThe mercury hit a record high of 67 degrees in normally frigid Chicago as hundreds of people gathered for a \"Not My President's Day\" protest across the Chicago River from Trump Tower. This time, they kept their pants on. Last week, anti-Trump protesters mass-mooned the building to protest Trump's refusal to release his tax records. \nOutside Los Angeles City Hall, hundreds more demonstrators rallying against Trump chanted: \"Resist! Resist! Resist!\" \nThere was also a massive anti-Trump rally across the pond in London outside the Palace of Westminster, home of the British Parliament. About 1.85 million Brits have signed a petition demanding that Trump be dis-invited from a state visit to the Great Britain later this year. \nMore from NBC News: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:55:01.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
