Dollar slips after U.S. employment report points to tepid wage growth \nInvesting.com - The dollar slid on Friday as the latest U.S. employment report showed that jobs growth beat expectations, but wage growth remained tepid , which will likely prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt a more cautious approach on raising interest rates this year. \nThe U.S. dollar index , which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.14% at 99.69 late Friday. \nFor the week the index was down 0.69%, its sixth consecutive weekly decline. \nThe Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 227,000 jobs in January from the prior month, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.8% from 4.7% in December, as more Americans joined the workforce. \nEconomists had forecast nonfarm payrolls rising by 175,000 last month. \nBut average hourly earnings rose 2.5% in January from a year earlier, slowing from 2.8% in December. \nThe slowdown in wage growth prompted speculation that the Fed will avoid hiking interest rates too quickly. \nIn its latest monetary policy statement on Wednesday the Fed stuck to its view that the economy is strengthening, but gave no clear signal on the timing of its next rate hike as officials wait to assess the possible economic impact of the Trump administration’s protectionist policies and recent remarks about currencies. \nThe greenback has been hard hit by concerns that a preference for a weak dollar could have a prominent role to play in Trump's 'America First' agenda. \nThe dollar dipped against the yen, with USD/JPY dipping 0.13% to 112.64 late Friday. The pair ended the week down 1.75%, its worst weekly performance since late June. \nThe dollar was also weaker against the euro, with EUR/USD rising 0.22% to 1.0783, bringing the week’s gains to 0.61%. \nAgainst the pound, the dollar was higher, with GBP/USD down 0.32% at 1.2483. \nSterling came under pressure after data on Friday showing that growth in the dominant UK service sector slowed for the first time in four months in January as rising costs hit consumer spending. \nThe data was the latest indication that the sharp fall in sterling since the June Brexit vote could act as a drag on growth. \nIn the coming week, China is to release data on service sector activity and trade, while a report on German factory orders will be in focus in the euro zone. \nThe U.S. is to release monthly trade figures in what will be a thin week for economic data. \nAhead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets. \nMonday, February 6 \nAustralia is to release data on retail sales. \nChina is to publish its Caixin services PMI. \nIn the euro zone, Germany is to report on factory orders. \nTuesday, February 7 \nThe Reserve Bank of Australia is to announce its benchmark interest rate and publish a rate statement which outlines economic conditions and the factors affecting the monetary policy decision. \nNew Zealand is to release a report on inflation expectations. \nThe UK is to publish a report on house price inflation. \nCanada is to release reports on trade, building permits and business activity. \nThe U.S. is also to release its latest trade figures. \nWednesday, February 8 \nThe European Commission is to release its latest economic forecasts for the European Union. \nThursday, February 9 \nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand is to announce its benchmark interest rate and hold a press conference to discuss the monetary policy decision. \nAustralia is to release a report on business confidence. \nCanada is to report on new house price inflation. \nThe U.S. is to publish data on initial jobless claims and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans is to speak. \nFriday, February 10 \nThe RBA is to publish its monetary policy statement. \nChina is to release trade figures. \nThe UK is to produce reports on manufacturing production and trade. \nCanada is to publish its monthly employment report. \nThe U.S. is to round up the week with preliminary figures on consumer sentiment.
