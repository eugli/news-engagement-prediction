Trump had faced mounting criticism for not speaking out on the matter, and some Jewish leaders said Tuesday that his remarks in Washington were still insufficient.\nRead more: \nAnne Frank Center calls Trump’s anti-Semitism statement ‘pathetic’ \n  Pence made his unadvertised visit to the cemetery shortly after delivering a speech at a distribution point of Cat construction equipment in Fenton, Mo.

Eric Greitens and U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence view some of the damage done at the Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in University City, Mo., on Wednesday. More than 150 headstones had been overturned by vandals over the weekend. ( J.B. Forbes / St. Louis Post-Dispatch ) At the top of his speech on the economy, Pence also paused to address the cemetery vandalism.\n“We condemn this vile act of vandalism and those who perpetrated it in the strongest possible terms,” he said.\nA groundskeeper arrived Monday morning to find gravestones overturned across a wide section of the cemetery, the oldest section, bearing the remains of Jews who died between the late 1800s and the mid-20th century.\nWhile at the cemetery on Wednesday, Pence also heard a prayer from a rabbi and joined Gov. Eric Greitens in clearing brush.\nAfter Pence’s visit, one of the groups that had been critical of Trump’s response to the vandalism issued a statement praising the vice-president.\n“Today, Vice-President Pence proved to be the ultimate mensch by visiting, and even cleaning, the desecrated Jewish graves in St. Louis,” said Steven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center. “Through the Vice-President’s visit to St. Louis today, this administration finally showed America the kind of response our nation was waiting for all along — a response filled with proactive heart.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:59:23.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
