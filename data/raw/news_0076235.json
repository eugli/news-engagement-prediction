I'm nearly 40, I don't know who I am,\" she said. \"I can’t claim to have gone through what the other people on this panel have gone through, I’ve not come out, I don’t know who I am. \n\"Honest truth? I am asexual right now. I don’t want sex with anybody. I’m not interested in sex with anybody.\" \nShe was on the panel chaired by BBC Radio 1 host Adele Roberts with Transexual Summer star Lewis Hancox, UK Black Pride’s Phyll Opuku-Gyimah, Straight Jacket author Matthew Todd and singer Sarah Nimmo. \nJesting with Adele Roberts who commented on how young she looks she said her secret was “botox”. \nTalking more about how unnecessary labels are, she added: \"I know I‘m attracted to women just as much as men. I look at women, does that make me bisexual? I don’t like labels. I don’t need to say I’m gay or bisexual, it doesn’t matter to me. (Photo: Instagram / Jodie Marsh) \n\"If I fancy a woman, I want to look at pictures of her, I don’t need to tell everyone. It’s not like I’m ashamed of it.\" \nAs a Being Me Ambassador, the charity who calls out bullying and focuses on the multiple identities we all have she spoke about how she \"experienced lots of prejudice\" in lots of ways. \nHowever, Jodie has previously body-shamed her ex-boyfriends with penis size slurs, which suggests she's struggling with consistent principles. \nSpecifically, she publicly humiliated her ex-husband, James Placido, with the distasteful allegation.
