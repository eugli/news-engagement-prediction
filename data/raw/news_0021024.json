Cypher, to serve on the Supreme Judicial Court, his latest step in reshaping the state’s high court, according to two sources familiar with the decision. \nCypher’s nomination would be Baker’s fourth since he took office just over two years ago. If confirmed by the Governor’s Council, she would take the seat currently held by Justice Margot Botsford, appointed by Governor Deval Patrick in 2007 and set to retire next month. Advertisement \nThe senior associate justice on the appeals court, Cypher was appointed in 2000 by Governor Paul Cellucci, for whom Baker was an aide in the 1990s. She worked in the Bristol district attorney’s office, first as an assistant district attorney and then as chief of the office’s appellate division, according to an online biography. \nThe pick sustains Baker’s pattern of naming former prosecutors to the bench. All three appointees he made last year had prosecutorial experience. Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email.

She taught law at the Southern New England School of Law, now the University of Massachusetts School of Law — Dartmouth. \nSuffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said Cypher had an “excellent reputation as an appellate advocate” and a “very strong intellect.” Advertisement \n“My sense is that she’s a real common-sense judge, and she’s pretty steady, pretty solid, really follows the rule of law,” Conley said Tuesday. “There seems to be a real steadiness to her writing and her decision-making.” \nIn a unanimous appeals court ruling last year which found that seven current and former Harvard University students had no legal standing to force the school to divest from coal, gas, and oil industries over climate change concerns, Cypher wrote that the students’ contentions that “fossil fuel investments have a chilling effect on academic freedom and have other negative impacts on their education at the university . . . were too speculative, too conclusory, and not sufficiently personal to establish standing.” \nA Pittsburgh native, Cypher lives in Assonet with her wife, Sharon Levesque, and their son. \nThe seven-seat Supreme Judicial Court is widely regarded as one of the most influential state courts, and Baker is due to have another pick this year. \nLike fellow Patrick nominee Botsford, Justice Geraldine S. Hines, who was a civil rights and criminal defense lawyer before taking a judgeship, is due to reach the mandatory retirement age of 70 this year. Hines was the first African-American woman to serve on the Supreme Judicial Court. \nBaker last year formed a panel to review applicants, calling for applicants “from a cross-section of our community, and should represent not only geographically diverse regions of the Commonwealth,” but “also the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of our citizens.” \nBaker is expected to announce Cypher’s nomination at an 11 a.m. State House press conference. The Governor’s Council’s approval would be necessary for her to take the seat on the state’s high court. Jim O’Sullivan can be reached at . Follow him on Twitter @Josreports .
