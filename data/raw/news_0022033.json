SEE ALSO: Newborn baby becomes ideal wingman in father's surprise proposal \nAustin McMillan and her boyfriend, Nick Janevsky, attended a pre-show meet-and-greet on Friday to meet McMillan's favorite performer. When the couple got in front of the singer, Janevsky got down on one knee, pulled out a ring, and proposed. \nMcMillan said in an Instagram post that the events of that evening came as a surprise — but from the pictures, no one was more surprised than Dion. Just check out the look on her face.

She was super sweet and wished us a long and happy marriage like she had with her husband,\" McMillian said in an ET interview. \"Then [she] invited herself to the wedding!\" \nWe hope Dion can take a break from her Vegas show to attend the couple's nuptials. Maybe she'll even sing the couple's first dance song. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T15:20:14.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
