A spate of turnovers were to blame and the Buckeyes also failed to get a quality shot in the final seconds after Nebraska went ahead on a blown defensive assignment with 10 seconds left. \nThe defeat was OSU’s latest home loss to an unranked team on the schedule since a loss to Iowa on the same date in 2004. That was coach Jim O’Brien’s last season as the OSU coach. \nThe loss was also OSU’s third in a row and dropped the Buckeyes to 15-13 overall and 5-10 in Big Ten play. It assures the Buckeyes of their first sub.-500 record in conference play in coach Thad Matta’s 13 seasons at the helm. \nBarring a miraculous turnaround, Ohio State will miss the NCAA Tournament for the second straight season. That has not happened for an eligible OSU team since the Buckeyes missed the tournament in 2002-03 and 2003-04. \nMatta has two years remaining on his OSU contract and some have surmised he or the university could be looking for a way out. \nBut Matta has two players signed to enroll at OSU this summer (prep school guard Braxton Beverly and Ohio center Kaleb Wesson ). He also had three commitments lined up for 2018 (shooting guard Dane Goodwin , wing Justin Ahrens and forward Darius Bazley ). \nMatta has been busy on the recruiting trail scouting and offering 2018 and 2019 prospects (high school juniors and sophomores). \nAsked if his commitment to recruiting shows he will be at OSU for the long haul, Matta said, “Oh, absolutely. No question about that.” \nOn Tuesday, Matta was spotted in a gym in New Jersey observing 2018 point guard Jahvon Quinerly . \n“We’ve been on the road,” Matta said. “For me, personally, I am very very excited for what the future holds for us in terms of that. We are trying to add to that. I’ve been out and about a couple nights a week all over the country, to be honest with you. I have seen some good ones.” \nA reporter asked Matta how he has been holding up during this tough season. \n“I think this profession, if you do this long enough you sort of become numb,” Matta said. “I have always said this. I don’t get too high and I don’t get too low. Am I a little bit lower than normal? Yeah, I probably am. \n“There are some things I know this team can do and there is a level this team can play at. Somehow, some way, we have to get them to believe they can do that. I walked into the locker room at halftime on Saturday and it felt like we were down 30. I was like, ‘Holy (cow), fellas, we’re up six.’ This team needs substance. It’s not something to feel good about. \n“The question was about me … I’m doing fine.” \nOSU will host No. 16 Wisconsin on Thursday (9 p.m., ESPN). The Buckeyes will wrap the regular season with a road game at Penn State Tuesday and a home game with Indiana March 4. \nStay tuned for our OSU-Wisconsin preview and a feature on freshman center Micah Potter . \nAlso Check Out ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:01:09.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
