(� Kate Munsch / Reuters/REUTERS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated:  22 AM \nThe states of Washington and Minnesota fired back at the Justice Department’s attempt to reinstate the travel ban with a little help from a who's who of former White House advisors. \nFormer Secretary of States Madeline Albright and John Kerry were among a deluge of national security, foreign policy and intelligence heavy weights backing up claims that the short-lived travel restrictions signed by the President would \"unleash chaos” if the 9th District Court of Appeals allows the Trump administration to bring it back. \n\"We all are nevertheless unaware of any specific threat that would justify the travel ban.” \nThe amicus brief snagged signatures from Obama’s Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, National Security Advisor Susan Rice and Bush’s Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Michael Hayden. \n\"We view the Order as one that ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer,” according to their filing. \"In our professional opinion, this Order cannot be justified on national security or foreign policy grounds.\" Madeleine Albright signed off on an amicus brief supporting Washington's case against Trump's travel ban. (Chris Usher/AP) \nThe former state officials argue that Trump’s mandate will only fuel the Islamic State’s propaganda and recruitment “by feeding into the narrative that the United States is at war with Islam.” \nThe brief was cited by Washington’s Attorney General Robert Ferguson in his response to the Justice Department’s emergency motion demanding a stay on a ruling that stunted the travel ban nationwide. \nA midnight motion filed through Trump's acting general solicitor on Saturday sought an emergency stay on Judge James Robart's monumental order in Seattle, which allowed nationals from the banned countries to enter the United States over the weekend. \nThe state's response follows the appeals court's request for more information after temporarily denying the government's request. Former Secretary of State John Kerry was also included in a list of former White House advisors that railed against the travel ban. (Alex Brandon/AP) \nFerguson urged a three-judge panel to “decline” the Justice Department’s request to lift a stay on a travel ban targeting seven predominantly Muslim countries. \nFerguson defended his state’s lawsuit as an economic and family burden. \n“Husbands were separated from wives, brothers from sisters, and parents from their children. Some who had waited decades to see family members that that reunion taken away without warning or reason.” \n“Washington’s economy was also immediately impacted,” he wrote, adding that several Seattle-based companies, such as Amazon and Microsoft, defend on “skilled immigrants.” Apple CEO Tim Cook, right, meets with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in December.

(Evan Vucci/AP) \nMicrosoft was among nearly 100 tech giants that joined Ferguson’s response in jeering the Trump administration's travel ban as a deal breaker for innovation. \nApple, Facebook and Google celebrated immigrants as the heart of \"the country's most innovative and iconic companies.\" \n“People who choose to leave everything that is family and journey to an unknown land to make a new life necessarily are endowed with drive, creativity, determination — and just plain guts,\" the document states. \nBriefs such as these hold no legal weight over the decision expected from the 9th District Court of Appeals in San Francisco but is a mere suggestion. U.S. District Judge James Robart issued a temporary stay on a travel ban imposed by President Trump. (JOSE ROMERO/AFP/Getty Images) \nThe brief depicts Trump's travel ban as a violation of U.S. immigration laws, the Constitution and a detriment to business dealings domestically and overseas. \n\"It hinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent; increases costs imposed on business; makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace; and gives global enterprises a new, significant incentive to build operations — and hire new employees — outside the United States,” writes Mayer Brown partners Andrew Pincus and Paul Hughes. \nBoth lawyers represented foreign nationals denied entry to the United States during the initial airport chaos nationwide. \nSeparately, the Fred T. Korematsu Center for Law and Equality in Seattle filed its own strongly worded brief suggest history will remember the White House’s executive order as the nation's latest misstep in human rights. Dozens of travelers were detained in the intiial customs chaos at JFK Airport after Trump announced the travel ban.
