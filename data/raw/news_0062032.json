In Here Alone , these woods and being alone are not choices for Ann. This naturally beautiful environment becomes a prison. There’s no escaping to return to a ‘regular life.'” Here Alone stars Lucy Walters, Gina Piersanti, Adam David Thompson, and Shane West and is written by David Ebeltoft. Vertical Entertainment is releasing the film in theaters on March 31. You can exclusively see the trailer for Here Alone , above.
