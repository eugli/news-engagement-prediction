The state education authority today unveiled back-to-basics syllabuses for English, maths, science and history, focusing on studying fewer subjects in more depth. This will include a solid grounding in reading and writing, so young people don’t grow up lacking basic language skills. While many of us never learnt grammar in depth at school, all year 12 students will now study the subject. In a world in which language is constantly evolving and we increasingly communicate using slang, photos and emojis, this will be a welcome development for despairing punctuation fans. All students will now take a module called The Craft of Writing, in which they will experiment with different language forms and features and learn to “apply the conventions of syntax, spelling, punctuation and grammar.” It is the first time the syllabuses have been updated since the current HSC was launched nearly 20 years ago. NSW Education Standards Authority Chairman Tom Alegounarias said students would now have a richer learning experience and develop a greater mastery of knowledge and skills. NESA Chief Executive Officer David de Carvalho said: “The strength of the NSW syllabuses and the world-class reputation of the HSC rests on extensive consultation with the education community, including support and input from principals, teachers, academics and parents. “The syllabuses are designed to equip NSW students with the skills they will require after they leave school, for further study, work and life.” Take the quiz below. <a href=\"//newspolls.polldaddy.com/s/let-s-go-back-to-school\">View Survey</a> How did you do?
