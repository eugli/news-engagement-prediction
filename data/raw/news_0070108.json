Credit: Inside Edition on YouTube \nEtterlene DeBarge, the mother of Janet’s musician first husband, James DeBarge, says she remembers speaking with a very pregnant Miss Jackson three decades ago, years before the performer gave birth to new baby boy Eissa . \nThe “Rhythm Nation” singer’s 1980s comments on a possible pregnancy were shocking. \n\"I told her she was pregnant; I didn't ask her,\" Etterlene tells Inside Edition of the star. \n\"I said, 'Girl, you pregnant. Look how fat you're getting.'” \nWhile any woman not expecting a baby would be insulted by that statement, Janet had a very different reaction. Embed from Getty Images \n“She just laughed it off. She never denied it,\" the DeBarge mom reveals. \nEtterlene has been searching for her possible granddaughter since that awkward encounter and may have finally found her. \nThe would-be celebrity grandma says she’s been contacted by countless women claiming to be Janet’s secret baby and one finally seems plausible. \nThe evidence is pretty undeniable. \n\"I told her, 'The proof is in the pudding. Let's go get a DNA test,'\" Etterlene says of someone claiming to be Janet’s daughter, whom she now has photos with. \nThe proof was definitely there once the results arrived. \nThe “probability of relatedness” between Etterlene and the unnamed 31-year-old Philadelphia woman is a whopping 96.7 percent. \nStill, this apparent proof of relatedness leaves one big question open. \nIs the mysterious Philadelphian Janet ’s daughter? \nThe DNA may prove a link to Etterlene and Janet’s ex-husband, but proves nothing about the identity of the mother. \nDo you believe Janet’s daughter has finally been uncovered?
