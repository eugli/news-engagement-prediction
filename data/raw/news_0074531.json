Assuming the videos are real, they corroborate earlier images that showed off the S8’s updated design , including the switch from physical buttons to digital ones.\nSamsung is scheduled to officially announce the Galaxy S8 next month on March 29th. Given the rate that information about the phone continues to show up online, though, it’s possible we’ll already know everything there is to know well before Samsung does formally launch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:26:00.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
