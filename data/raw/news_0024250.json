New Delhi worries about his erstwhile staffers who are now in critical positions in administration and who are now pushing the same line of thinking, most critically Stephen Miller, a senior Trump adviser. \nMiller subscribes to Sessions’s skepticism about H-1Bs completely and tabled critical changes in the current system in a meeting Trump had with Silicon Valley CEOs and leaders earlier, famously branded as the Tech Summit. \nOne, do away with the lottery system of distributing the annual quota of H-1Bs as the demand far outstrips the availability, and replace it with a system that will give priority to visa applications for high-paying jobs. \nTwo, remove the Masters degree waiver to attract really the best and the most educated foreigners and not those brought here to replace Americans even from relatively lower-skilled, low-paying jobs, as has happened under outsourcing. \nTrump is reportedly considering a set of changes on H-1B, and could, as reflected in a leaked draft of an executive order going around, seek a review of the present system with recommendations for what needs to stay and change. \nSessions, it is expected, will be a close adviser on the issue. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:54:05.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
