The new water sources and bottling operation would increase its production capacity from about 900 million gallons a year to 1.3 billion gallons. \nUp to 80 new jobs would be created. \nThe company says the plant must have relatively close access to an anchor spring and more distant feeder springs. The site must also be 60 to 120 acres and have access to major transportation routes. \nThe company estimates the plant would open sometime between 2020 and 2022.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:25:20.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
