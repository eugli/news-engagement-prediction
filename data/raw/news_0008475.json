(Brendan SmialowskiI / AFP/Getty Images) Joshua Partlow The Washington Post \nDid President Donald Trump threaten to invade Mexico? \nThat's the question at the heart of the new controversy over the phone call last Friday between Trump and President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico, and both sides say the answer is no. Several published accounts mentioned that Trump referred to all the \"bad hombres\" in Mexico and said that the U.S. military might have to take care of the problem if Mexico's armed forces weren't up to the task. \nMexican officials did not equate that with a threat to deploy south of the border. \n\"It's absolutely false that the United States president threatened to send troops to Mexico,\" Peña Nieto's spokesmen Eduardo Sanchez said in a radio interview. \nTrump was speaking in English on the call and Peña Nieto, who understands English, was responding in Spanish, which was being simultaneously translated for Trump. \nThe call came amid a thunderclap of tension between the two countries last week. Trump had tweeted last Thursday that Peña Nieto shouldn't come to Washington, as planned, if Mexico wasn't prepared to pay for the wall. Peña Nieto quickly canceled his trip. The two sides arranged a follow-up call for the next day. \nThe Associated Press, citing an excerpt from a transcript of the phone call, said that Trump warned that he was prepared to send American troops to stop \"bad hombres down there\" unless the Mexican military did more to control them. It was not clear whether the \"bad hombres\" were drug traffickers or other criminals, the news agency said. Mexico's Foreign Ministry denied such statements were used at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:32:22.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
