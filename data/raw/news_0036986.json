Profoundly affected by Alzheimer’s disease, she was unable to attend either one or enjoy her belated success. “All the timings were wrong with my mother, so I’m not surprised this happened so late,” her daughter told The International Herald Tribune (now the international edition of The New York Times) in 2013. “She started with abstraction when people in Beirut were just discovering Impressionism. In the ’60s, no one was paying attention to her, and then when they started paying attention, the war started. Even if there was some good attention, something always went a little wrong.” In an effort to redraw the art-historical map, Jessica Morgan, now the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York, organized the Tate show after chancing upon a work by Ms. Choucair in 2009 at a Beirut gallery. Speaking to BBC television in 2013, she said, “Her work is highly experimental, and she continued throughout her life to produce an extraordinary body of sculpture and painting that in many ways allows us to rethink abstraction.” Photo Three stone works by Ms. Choucair: from left, “Movement of the Angle”; “Infinite Module”; and “Infinite Structure.” Credit David Smith She was born Saloua Raouda in Beirut on June 24, 1916. Her father, Salim Raouda, was a landowner and pharmacist. He died of typhus soon after being conscripted into the Ottoman Army during World War I, leaving his wife, Zalfa Najjar, to raise their three children. The family, which was well off, belonged to the often persecuted Druze sect, a non-Islamic religion. Saloua attended the progressive Ahliyyah School for Girls and took painting lessons with the nationalist landscape artists Moustafa Faroukh and Omar Onsi. She studied biology at the American Junior College for Women and philosophy and history at the American University of Beirut. An extended trip to Cairo in 1943 exposed her to Islamic art and architecture. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story She helped found the Arab Cultural Center in Beirut and in 1947 exhibited at its gallery in what was often cited as the first showing of modern abstract art in the Arab world. That year she left for Paris to study at the École des Beaux-Arts, whose traditionalist training she supplemented with classes at the more freewheeling Académie de la Grande Chaumière. After hearing the painter and sculptor Fernand Léger speak at the École des Beaux-Arts, she spent time at his studio before coming into her own as an early member of L’Atelier d’Art Abstrait (the Studio of Abstract Art), led by Edgar Pillet and Jean Dewasne. She developed a series of jewel-like small paintings of interlocking geometric forms that she exhibited with the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles, founded by Sonia Delaunay and Nelly van Doesburg. In 1951 she had a solo show at the Galerie Colette Allendy before returning to Beirut, where she married Yusif Choucair, a journalist. Photo “Poem,” one of several Choucair sculptures by that name.

Ms. Choucair’s approach was rigorously reductive and purist. “Arabs are the most sensitively sophisticated of peoples in understanding art, and that is why they broached the subject at its abstract essence,” she wrote in her 1951 manifesto , “How the Arab Understood Visual Art.” The goal, she added, was “the eternal essence that is defined neither by time nor space.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
