Professor Cox has pointed to The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) - the world's most powerful particle accelerator - to explain why spectres and phantoms are the stuff of fiction. Speaking on his BBC Radio Four programme The Infinite Monkey Cage, he said experiments carried out the LHC in Geneva, Switzerland, proved that the existence of the paranormal is 'inconceivable'. Scroll down for video Professor Brian Cox, pictured, has pointed to The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to explain why spectres and phantoms are the stuff of fiction THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator. It first started up on 10 September 2008, and remains the latest addition to CERN’s accelerator complex. The LHC consists of a 17- mile ring of superconducting magnets with a number of accelerating structures to boost the energy of the particles along the way. Inside the accelerator, two high-energy particle beams travel at close to the speed of light before they are made to collide. Nobody knows what the facility might reveal with its collisions, which are mini-versions of the Big Bang that created the universe 13.8 billion years ago. The LHC is a 17 mile (27km) long tunnel created using super-conducting magnets that sit 100m (328 feet) under the ground. It belongs to the European Organisation of Nuclear Research (CERN), who use it to test out complex theories from particle physics. On an episode of his programme centred around the topic of the paranormal, Professor Cox said: 'Before we ask the first question, I want to make a statement: We are not here to debate the existence of ghosts because they don't exist. 'If we want some sort of pattern that carries information about our living cells to persist then we must specify precisely what medium carries that pattern and how it interacts with the matter particles out of which our bodies are made. 'We must, in other words, invent an extension to the Standard Model of Particle Physics that has escaped detection at the Large Hadron Collider. 'That's almost inconceivable at the energy scales typical of the particle interactions in our bodies.'
