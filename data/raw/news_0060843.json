It was very emotional and so painful. \n\"Then I started having panic attacks as I was worried to leave the house in case I passed out. \n\"By October I was pretty much in bed. I prayed every night because I thought I was going to die.\" She's now warning models in the industry about the potential side-effects of implants (Photo: Caters) \nThree different doctors and neurologist assessed Karen without a diagnosis. \nShe said: \"Everyone said there was nothing wrong with me.
