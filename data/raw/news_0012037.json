All three of those stories, and many others on the list, dominated the news cycle for weeks. The Orlando incident even made news a few weeks ago after the widow of the attacker, Omar Mateen, was arrested over allegations of obstruction of justice, among other charges. \nThe list includes dozens of attacks that received extensive media coverage, some that authorities have said don’t appear to be connected to terrorism at all, and several that resulted in no deaths.
