Thunder guard Russell Westbrook defends Warriors guard Stephen Curry (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:31 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:31 p.m. ET \nKevin Durant set off fireworks on July 4 when he announced he was leaving the Thunder — the only professional team he had ever known — for the Warriors. \nIn so doing, Durant caused Oklahoma City to lose not only its best player, but also a great source of pride in the community. Golden State added another superstar to a team that finished 73-9 in the regular season with unanimous MVP Stephen Curry (as the hundreds of internet jokesters may have told you). \nMORE: Looking ahead to Durant's OKC homecoming \nThunder fans will likely let Durant hear it when he returns to Chesapeake Energy Arena for the first time as a Warrior on Saturday (8 p.m. ET, ABC), and that's fair. The OKC fanbase is a passionate one, and it adopted Durant, watching him grow on and off the court. Many took Durant's departure personally; that's part of sports. As for the rest of us, we shouldn't denounce or denigrate him for his decision. \nBut we should be disappointed that we lost what could have been a great NBA rivalry. \nThe 2015-16 version of the Warriors went 3-0 against the Thunder prior to the postseason, but their games were filled with playoff intensity. Most notably, Curry gave us another one of his signature moments in the Feb. 27 matchup, draining the most memorable shot of the regular season with 0.6 seconds remaining in overtime to give Golden State a 121-118 win. Curry finished with 46 points on 12-of-16 shooting from 3-point range, Durant poured in 37 points and Westbrook added 26 points and 13 assists. Last year we got the shot of the year. What will happen this time when the @Warriors visit the @OKCThunder at 8:30pm/et? #NBAonABC pic.twitter.com/zfDX9en7kr — NBA (@NBA) February 11, 2017 \nThat was only a primer for what we would see in the Western Conference finals. The Thunder got the split at Oracle Arena to head back to Oklahoma City tied at 1-1 for the series. Then, the Thunder went nuclear, winning the next two games by a combined 52 points to take a 3-1 lead. \nThe Warriors had been punched in the mouth and looked more out of sync than they had all season. The Thunder defense was omnipresent, tipping away passes and loose dribbles with outstretched arms. A drive around Serge Ibaka only led to Durant swatting a reverse layup attempt on the other side of the rim. Steven Adams and Enes Kanter overwhelmed the Warriors with physicality, crashing the boards and banging Golden State's small-ball lineups. A combination of size, athleticism and the Westbrook-Durant duo appeared to be a viable formula to taking down Steve Kerr's squad. \nMORE: Durant reportedly bringing extra security for OKC game \nWe know that wasn't the end of the story, though. \nWhile the Warriors defended home court in Game 5, the Thunder had the advantage again in much of Game 6, leading for 44 minutes of action. But the Thunder could not close the door, and every time OKC gave an inch, Curry and Klay Thompson took at least another 23 feet and 8 inches — the distance from the NBA 3-point line to the basket. Thompson buried one of his 11 3-pointers with 1:35 left to put the Warriors ahead 104-101. He finished with 41 points, and the Thunder failed to score the rest of the game. \nWith the Thunder's loss, the feeling of invincibility rushed back to the Warriors. This team just figures out a way to win, a way to do the impossible. Curry and Thompson hit the shots no one can make, Andre Iguodala swiped the ball for a steal on a key possession and Steve Kerr tweaked the lineup at the perfect time. The Cavs may have shattered that image in the NBA Finals but, at the time, the Thunder proved themselves worthy adversaries to the Warriors, capable of pushing mighty Golden State to the brink of elimination. \nThat series set the stage for years to come. Faces of the league fighting for conference supremacy and a chance for championships. But the very thing that made Game 6 so mystifying in retrospect also played a role in Durant leaving: Kerr admitted as much Saturday ahead of the Warriors' first game in Oklahoma City since Thompson's explosion. \n\"I would say, and this is nothing coming from Kevin, but I think if you just look at it objectively and circumstantially, if they beat us, they go to the Finals, tough to see him going here,\" Kerr said ( via ESPN ). \nMORE: Westbrook opens up on state of relationship with Durant \nBut they didn't. \nNow, Durant is part of a 45-8 team ranked No. 1 in true shooting percentage, No. 1 in offensive efficiency and No. 2 in defensive efficiency. It's becoming a fully functioning Death Star, except Durant closed up that tiny gap capable of blowing everything up. \nThe Warriors have dominated both matchups this season against the Thunder, winning each game by at least 21 points. We aren't watching a rivalry so much as we're hoping Westbrook can go supernova and keep things interesting. \nThe duo of Westbrook and Durant was capable of throwing a monkey wrench into the Warriors' plans. There's a feeling of certainty and probability now, even if that doesn't necessarily mean inevitability. \nOh, what could have been.
