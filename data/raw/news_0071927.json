Is this the end of patient rebuilding in L.A.? Magic Johnson (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:02 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:02 p.m. ET \nFor the past year, with the wrapping up of Kobe Bryant’s career, the replacing of Byron Scott with Luke Walton and the drafting of a promising bundle of young players, the Lakers have shown the kind of commitment to patient rebuilding that many feared the organization would not be able to stomach. \nAnd then, on Tuesday, they obliterated that patience by lowering a front-office wrecking ball through the org chart, firing general manager Mitch Kupchak and longtime team spokesman John Black, while pushing aside Jim Buss as the team’s executive vice president. \nNow in charge: former Lakers star Magic Johnson, who will replace Buss. Johnson could recruit Bryant , too, for some role in the team’s front office, and the Vertical reported that Bryant’s agent, Rob Pelinka, is a possible candidate to take Kupchak’s job. \nThe Lakers thus will have given the heave-ho to some of the most experienced guys in the business, replacing them with well-known but utterly inexperienced newbies. \nMORE: Magic Johnson's past tweets raise some questions about his eye for personnel \nThat could spell trouble for the Lakers’ designs on steady rebuilding now that Bryant is out of the league. For the last few years, L.A. has been unable to bring in (or in the case of Dwight Howard, keep) major free agents despite long-shot pitches made to the likes of Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge and DeAndre Jordan. \nThe Lakers—rightfully so—were criticized for not making particularly compelling pitches to any of those players. Kupchak and Jim Buss seemed to approach free-agent meetings with a certain level of entitlement, as though players just wanted to play in L.A., like they had wanted to do for decades before. \nBut criticizing their pitch meetings misses the point. Fact is, the Lakers never really had a chance at any of those major free agents, not while the team was sinking in the standings as Bryant hobbled through a variety of injuries at the end of his time with the team. Whether free agents wanted to play with Bryant was a percolating question even when he was fully healthy. In his last three years, there was no chance. \nWhen Bryant left last year, the Lakers were 17-65, the worst season in their history. Free agent Kevin Durant decided he was not even going to meet with the Lakers, pointing out that they are still a long way from contention. If you’re not even getting a meeting with Durant, then you can’t say that Buss and Kupchak blew the pitch. \nIs that really going to change with Johnson at the helm? Sure, he would bring a little more personality to free-agent meetings, but that’s not going to change a lot of minds when it comes to actually getting names on contracts. The only way the Lakers can do that is by starting to turn around their fortunes on the floor. They’ve got to win. \nThere is some hope when it comes to that. Whatever mistakes Kupchak and Jim Buss made in recent years, they had the good sense to collect a promising young core, including Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell and Brandon Ingram. There is little sense knocking your head against the wall in free agency if you can build through the draft. (The Knicks can attest to this.) \nBefore this weekend brought Johnson into the fold, executives around the league were saying that the Lakers had been turning down all proposed deals that would involve any of those three. League executives will spend the next two days ahead of the trade deadline circling Lakers prospects, seeing if Johnson is more open to dealing his youngsters. \nMORE: The latest in NBA trade rumors \nKupchak and Buss were at the helm of the team during its darkest days, and Buss, at least, had promised the Lakers would be out of the woods by now. They’re not. But there are plenty of franchises that would swap spots with the Lakers, with its young core and competent young coach. Patience isn’t easy, but there have been signs that it would pay off in L.A. \nNow, with Johnson in charge, that could change, and quickly.
