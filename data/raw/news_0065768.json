During their shopping trip, Walker’s son, Alistair, grew restless. When the family reached the checkout, Alistair recognized the cashier as the man who said, “hello” to him when they first arrived and yelled, “Hiya hiya!” That’s when the cashier went above and beyond and comforted Walker’s restless son by letting him help behind the checkout. \nWalker was so moved by the cashier’s kindness that she posted about her experience on the official Marks and Spencer Facebook page and shared a video of Alistair helping the cashier. In her post, she wrote about how much her son enjoyed spending time with him. \n“He smiled and squealed the full way through it because he was having so much fun!” she wrote in her post. “This man made my shopping experience so much easier and the fact he took time with my son as well was great.” \nWalker told The Huffington Post she and her son have never experienced something like this while out shopping. Once Walker finished up paying, Alistair didn’t want to leave his new friend. \n“This is why I recorded it while my mum was packing the shopping because it was so kind of him and you could see he was great with kids,” she said. “My son wasn’t happy when it was time to leave because he was enjoying himself too much!” \nWalker hasn’t seen the cashier since, but did receive a reply via a Facebook comment from Marks and Spencer. \n“It looks like your little one was having a great time and it’s really good to see how our colleague was so helpful and interactive with our customers,” the company wrote. “I’ll make sure this is shared on our internal employee page and that our Store Manager gets to hear about it too! We can then give him the recognition he deserves.” \nWhen asked if she had anything else she’d like to say to the kind cashier, Walker said she wanted to say, “thank you.” \n“He went above and beyond his duty of care just because he thought all he was doing was his job!” ALSO ON HUFFPOST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:13:12.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
