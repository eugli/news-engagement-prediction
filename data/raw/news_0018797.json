They are not the fringe. And newsflash for Justin Trudeau: they aren’t the fringe. He is.” \nLeitch's take on Trump \nLeitch wasn’t willing to weigh in on the prime minister’s reasoning that proportional representation could amplify some radical views, instead saying that she could not “speculate” on Trudeau’s plan. \n“He obviously realized that average Canadians out there want something that’s common sense. I’ve been talking about common-sense ideas, and I’ll continue to do that,” she said. \nLeitch, an Ontario MP and former surgeon, has been a divisive figure in the Conservative leadership race for months. She’s drawn criticism from her fellow candidates, with Quebec MP Maxime Bernier calling her a “karaoke version of Donald Trump.\" \nRegardless, recent financial reports released in late January suggest that Leitch’s message has struck a chord with some supporters. Leitch raked in $355,000 worth of donations in the final three months of 2016, second only to Bernier at $586,000 \nLeitch said she has no plans to back away from any of her policies, including her stance on immigration, reiterating that they are “common sense” policies that “the majority of Canadians support,” citing multiple public opinion polls on the issue. \nAsked about her stance on U.S. President Donald Trump’s travel ban, which has been temporarily blocked by a U.S. court and withstood a legal challenge Thursday from the U.S. Justice Department, Leitch said the United States “will make choices about what’s best for their country.” \n“They made a choice in that country of who would be president. They’ll make choices for their country,” she said. \nKouvalis confusion \nThe abrupt departure of Leitch’s campaign manager, Nick Kouvalis, made Canadian political headlines last week. Kouvalis had apologized for using a profane word on Twitter to describe a political science professor, and he was the subject of a recent Maclean’s Magazine article that addressed his brash political tactics, which included the spread of false information on social media that the Canadian government directly funded terrorist groups overseas. \nKouvalis explained his departure in a Facebook statement, saying that when “a member of a campaign team becomes the focus of media coverage, the time comes to resign.” He added that the pressures of the campaign “are not conducive to my personal wellbeing.” \nLeitch said that Kouvalis has apologized for his Twitter comments and remains on her team on a volunteer basis. But the reason for his departure, she said, was “health reasons.” \n“It was a decision that was taken by his family. And I was very clear with him from the beginning of the campaign, he and I had an agreement, which was if his health became an issue for him and his family, his family and his health came first. And so he stepped aside,” she said. \nIt was the second time Kouvalis resigned from Leitch’s team. In April 2016, he quit after he was charged with impaired driving. At the time, he said he’d struggled with alcohol addiction for years.
