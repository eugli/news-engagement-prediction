Jaime Garner Good morning, St. Louis! Here are five things to know before you start your busy day: 1. Food truck news: Wicked Greenz , located at 16 N. Central Ave. in Clayton, has announced it will open a new location in O'Fallon, Missouri, and launch a food truck. The new restaurant will open in June, while the food truck may make its debut at Taubman Prestige Outlets on April 21. Here are five things to know before starting your busy day. Jaime Garner 2. Beauty pageant: Missouri is the 34th most beautiful state , according to a new ranking from Thrillist, coming in ahead of Pennsylvania but behind South Carolina. California is the most beautiful state, followed by Hawaii, while Kansas came in at No. 50 and Indiana at No. 49. 3. Congratulations: WGU Missouri and its parent university, Western Governors University, have been recognized by two national magazines for supporting military service members and their families. Military Advanced Education & Transition has named WGU as a top school, while Victory Media has recognized it as military friendly. 4. Coding skills: The St. Louis County Library has announced a new series, titled Coding 101, for children ages 5 to 8, which will teach them basic coding skills. At the end of the eight-week workshop, the kids will take home a free Chromebook. The series begins March 11 at the Natural Bridge library branch. 5. Congratulations: Opera Theatre of Saint Louis general director Timothy O'Leary announced that soprano Andriana Chuchman has won the 2017 Mabel Dorn Reeder Foundation prize. Chuchman will receive a $10,000 award to help further her artistic and professional growth. A new TV show I am excited about: I know I've mentioned \"Big Little Lies\" here previously, but the TV show finally made its debut on HBO on Sunday. If you recall, \"Big Little Lies\" is a book I read last year. I'm not one to typically like a TV show or movie adaptation better than the book, but this may be one of the only times that I can say that I maybe do .... it was that good.
