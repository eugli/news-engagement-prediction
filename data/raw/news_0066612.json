Turkey disputes Greece's claim that the islands entered Greek ownership in 1947, after first being assigned to Italy in 1923 following the fall of the Ottoman Empire, according to the New York Times .\nCommenting on the issue, Murat Bilhan said that now that the territorial dispute between Turkey and Greece show no sign of abating, both sides continue to take bilateral provocative steps. \"The continuing uncertainty surrounding the islands exacerbate the already difficult Turkish-Greek relations, something that can only be resolved at the negotiating table,\" he said. — East Med Monitor (@EastMedMonitor) 16 февраля 2017 г. \nBilhan added that the two country's territorial spat \"periodically\" adds to the crisis in bilateral ties and that both sides \"should take a mutually acceptable decision on the matter.\" \"Delimitation and demarcation of the maritime areas in the Aegean Sea is a tricky process. It requires a balanced approach and mutual concessions,\" he pointed out. \nTalks to resolve the issue began after 1999, when Turkey agreed to resolve the bilateral dispute as part of its accession deal with the European Union. © AP Photo/ Vadim Ghirda Rising Tensions: Greece Reports Over 130 Airspace Violations by Turkey The 1996 standoff was triggered by a dispute during a Turkish-Greek cargo ship salvaging operation on the Imia islet, which lies with around just 4.5 miles off the Turkish coast. Turkey claimed sovereignty over the islet for the first during the incident.\nTensions were again stoked last month, when a Turkish missile boat approached the islet before being blocked by the Greek coast guard. \nThe incident took place after the Greek Supreme Court's ruling against the extradition of eight Turkish soldiers involved in a failed coup against the Turkish government last year. \nNever miss a story again — sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed! ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:34:40.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
