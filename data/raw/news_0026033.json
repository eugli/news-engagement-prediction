(Caddie Brain) \nMr Hardy said the mine usually had around 600 people on site at any one time. \n\"We don't have anyone going underground anymore and we only have power to keep pumps going so we don't flood the mine,\" he said. \n\"At the processing plant we've actually stopped and all we have at the moment is people doing maintenance. \n\"We only started losing production effectively from last Saturday, the 4th of February. \n\"For every week that we're down, we're losing about 8,000 ounces.\" \n\"I'm hoping that we can be up and running by the end of next week, two weeks maximum [all up] I'm hoping, obviously. It's all weather dependant.\" Road closure end in sight \nMr Hardy said the company was hoping the road would open up on the Halls Creek side in WA sometime next week, while the road on the Alice Springs side in the NT was estimated to be closed for another two to three weeks. \nHe said looking at their records, this is the longest they had ever been cut off. \n\"At the beginning of 2014 we were cut off for 31 days. At this stage it's been 57 days that we've been cut off,\" he said. \n\"We have had heavier rain, heavier downpours at times, but never this consistent.\" \nAs for whether or not this was the catalyst for sealing the Tanami Road, Mr Hardy said it would never be justified based on the mine's impact, but rather the local people driving back and forth between Yuendumu and Lajamanu. \n\"I don't have people driving back and forth on that road, it's only our deliveries to site. And typically we do account for about six weeks of delays on and off during the wet season.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:07:45.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
