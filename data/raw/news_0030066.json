The unusually honest tribute to Leslie Ray Charping, 75, from Texas, was posted to the website of the Carnes Funeral Home in Galveston, but has since been taken down.\nMr Charping, whose hobbies allegedly included “being abusive to his family”, died of cancer on 30 January.\nA family member said she wrote the obituary because “not talking about domestic violence doesn’t make it go away”.\nThe message painted a picture of a violent and drug addicted man who also experienced mental health issues.\nMr Charping left behind “two relieved children”, the obituary said, and “countless other victims including an ex-wife, relatives, friends, neighbours, doctors, nurses and random strangers”.\nIt continued: “At a young age, Leslie quickly became a model example of bad parenting combined with mental illness and a complete commitment to drinking, drugs, womanising and being generally offensive.”\nThe obituary said that while Mr Charping was “surprisingly intelligent”, he also “lacked ambition” for more than “being reckless, wasteful, squandering the family savings and fantasising about get rich quick schemes”.\nIt added: “Leslie’s life served no other obvious purpose, he did not contribute to society or serve his community and he possessed no redeeming qualities besides quick sarcasm, which was amusing during his sober days.”\nA funeral for Mr Charping would not be held, the obituary said, but his ashes would be used in the stable of a family donkey.\nThe obituary concluded: “With Leslie’s passing he will be missed only for what he never did; being a loving husband, father and good friend.\n“Leslie’s passing proves that evil does in fact die and hopefully marks a time of healing and safety for all.”\nThe family members who wrote the statement defended themselves from critics. The anonymous writer told ABC13 : “I am happy for those that simply do not understand, this means you had good parent(s) – please treasure what you have.”\nThe woman said people’s concern would have been better during her childhood.\nShe added: “I apologise to anyone that my father hurt and I felt it would have been offensive to portray him as anything other than who he was.\n“This obituary was intended to help bring closure because not talking about domestic violence doesn’t make it go away.”", "external_links": ["http://abc13.com/society/ouch-family-writes-brutal-obituary-for-local-man/1746919/", "http://abc13.com/society/ouch-family-writes-brutal-obituary-for-local-man/1746919/&quot;"], "published": "2017-02-12T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:20:39.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
