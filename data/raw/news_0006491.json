Pena suffered a second-round submission defeat at the hands of Valentina Shevchenko in the night’s main event, which aired live on FOX. Pena will now be required to seek physician clearance or sit out another 180 days before being allowed to resume active competition, per commission orders. Along with Pena, five other fighters received potential medical suspensions stretching longer than two months: Aljamain Sterling (180 days), Jordan Johnson (180 days), Eric Shelton (180 days), Jorge Masvidal (90 days), and Marcos Rogerio De Lima (90 days).
