(Calgary Zoo)\nAnd the naming process started.\n\"Now, as a king penguin, he needs an appropriate royal name,\" said zoo interpreter Lauryn Record.\n\"The kings are all named after royalty.\"\n\n\nZookeepers put together a list of names, whittled it down to three — Henry, Edward and Louis — and then zoo volunteers took a vote.\n\nThe winning name, Edward, was revealed on Thursday at the Penguin Plunge.\n\nThe chick is named after King Edward VII, who reigned from 1901 until his death in 1910.\n\n\"He was responsible for naming King Edward Point, which is on South Georgia Island, which is where the largest colony of king penguins are,\" Record said. \nEdward is already five kilograms heavier than his mom, Record said.\n\"King penguin chicks get to be super fat. And they're super adorable.\"\nEdward is the second king penguin born at the zoo. Nero hatched in 2015 and joined the king penguin colony last year. \nKing penguins are bred at the Calgary Zoo as part of a Species Survival Plan.\n\"So, having another addition is really exciting for all of us,\" Record said. \nThe zoo now has nine king penguins, 16 gentoos, five rockhoppers, and 15 Humboldts.\nTragically, seven Humboldt penguins were found drowned at the back of the Penguin Plunge exhibit in December.\nDespite an extensive investigation, the zoo said last month it's still not known what caused the deaths.\n​\nBaby Edward, newly hatched in August 2016, peeks out from under its mother, Grace, at the Calgary Zoo.
