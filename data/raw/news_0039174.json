BC Government’s Foreign Home Buyers Tax: Impact on Vancouver home prices by derailedcapitalism - Feb 15, 2017 1:37 PM \nJust about 6 months from when the BC government introduced its 15% property tax for foreign buyers of homes in Vancouver, the verdict is out. \"He Will Die In Jail\" - Intelligence Community Ready To \"Go Nuclear\" On Trump Feb 15, 2017 8:15 PM 0 SHARES \nAfter nearly two full days of media hysteria following the forced resignation of General Michael Flynn as National Security Advisor, a resignation which the Trump administration attributed to a 'trust issue' rather than any concerns over the legality of his actions, Trump took to twitter to ask why no one within the media seemed to care about the mass leaks being \"illegally given out by \"intelligence\" like candy\" before describing the actions as \"very un-American.\" The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2017 Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by \"intelligence\" like candy. Very un-American! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 \n\nAnd earlier today at a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump again called out the intelligence community saying they continue to commit \"criminal acts\" in leaking intelligence reports. \n\"Papers are being leaked, things are being leaked. It's a criminal action, criminal act. People are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton.\" \n\n\"I think it's very unfair what's happened with General Flynn and the documents and papers that were illegally leaked.\" Here's @POTUS comments on Flynn being treated \"unfairly\" and allegedly being targeted by Democrats: pic.twitter.com/tUJVJkcqrX \n— Tom Namako (@TomNamako) February 15, 2017 \n\nAs it turns out, at least according to former NSA intelligence analyst John Schindler, the folks within the intelligence community aren't taking too kindly to being called out by the President for their \"criminal acts\" or to being referred to as \"very un-American.\" By way of reminder, this is the same John Schindler who ended his relationship with the Naval War College after he was caught in a sexting scandal ... \nit was not Schindler’s unhinged comments that brought him to official disgrace. It was, ironically, his inappropriate use of communications technology. \n\nThe former employee of the premiere signal intelligence agency of the world stupidly decided to send a picture of his penis to a person he met on the internet. The picture, along with a corresponding email where Schindler said he was not in a traditional marriage, were made public by Twitter user @Currahee88. According to @Currahee88 the information was released to shame Schindler though Schindler initially speculated he may be the victim of an intelligence operation. \n\nSchindler was subsequently put on leave from the Naval War College pending a review. The review was completed with the result reportedly told to Schindler in late July that he was out at the Naval War College. He was apparently given the option of resigning rather than being fired, which he took. \nBut we digress. In a series of tweets posted earlier today, Schindler relayed the very blunt thoughts of a \"senior intelligence community friend\": \n\"Now we go nuclear. IC war going to new levels. Just got an EM fm senior IC friend, it began: \"He will die in jail.\" US intelligence is not the problem here. \nThe President's collusion with Russian intelligence is. \nMany details, but the essence is simple. \n— John Schindler (@20committee) February 15, 2017 Now we go nuclear. IC war going to new levels. Just got an EM fm senior IC friend, it began: \"He will die in jail.\" https://t.co/e6FxCclVqT \n— John Schindler (@20committee) February 15, 2017 \n\nSo when efforts to spin a Russian hacking narrative fail to sway an electorate in the desired direction of the intelligence community, we guess treason is the logical next step?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:36:47.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
