It was a long day at the park, but it was a really good one.” \nAgainst Indiana State in game two of the afternoon, MSU (6-2) got a double dose of work as Peyton Plumlee added to the Bulldogs’ potent offensive performance with 8.0 innings of shutout work on the mound. He picked up his second win in as many starts to begin his Bulldog career. \n“I felt good,” Plumlee said. “Coach (Gary) Henderson is always preaching to keep the ball down in the zone. That’s what I’ve been trying to do and it’s been helping me.” \nThe top of MSU’s order continued their hot hitting on the weekend by getting three hits to start the ball game as Jake Mangum singled, Luke Alexander doubled and Ryan Gridley drove in a run. Cody Brown would bring Gridley in on a sacrifice fly later in the inning as State took the 2-0 lead. \nGridley was back in the third inning with some noise as he went opposite field to right for a home run into the lounge. \n“I was thinking about him throwing a fastball and I wasn’t really trying to put it anywhere. I was really just trying to hit it hard,” Gridley said. “Somehow, I put it the right way. The wind was blowing hard so I’m not going to take any credit.” \nThe 3-0 lead was all MSU really needed thanks to Plumlee’s night, but they weren’t done. \nState added four runs in the bottom of the fifth inning led by a three-run home run from Brown. Two more runs came across in the sixth as Brant Blaylock started the inning with a triple and was driven home by Mangum. Gridley singled home another run for the 9-0 advantage. \nFreshman Denver McQuary closed out the game giving up a leadoff hit and that runner eventually came around and scored on a wild pitch. That was all the offense that ISU could muster in the contest. \nWith nine more runs on the board against ISU, State has scored eight or more runs in each of the last seven games. That’s the first time that’s happened for the Diamond Dawgs since 2004.

The junior short stop went 4-for-5 in game two with three RBI and is 11-for-13 in three games this weekend. \n“Since I’ve been here, Gridley has given us great at bats every single day,” Cannizaro. “He wasn’t bad last weekend, I just thought his swing was a little big. He was a little amped up. This weekend, everything starts to slow down a little bit. What he’s doing the last three days is what he’s been doing for us.” \nAlexander had a 3-of-5 night with an RBI and Brown was 2-for-3 with a game-high four RBI on a double and a home run. \nMangum improved his hitting streak to 21 games continuing from last season. He was 2-for-4 with two runs scored sending his average to .457 in the early season. \nState looks to go a perfect 4-0 when they meet back up with Marist on Sunday at 1 p.m. The game was moved up from the previously scheduled 2 p.m. first pitch to allow fans an opportunity to watch the women’s basketball team go for their first-ever SEC Championship against Tennessee at 4 p.m. \nSophomore Ryan Cyr (0-0, 9.00) will be on the mound drawing his second start.
