The ATGMs are built under license from Russian and French firms, and they will give us country-specific export clearance,” Bhaskar said. BDL has already inked a deal with Myanmar for supplying light-weight torpedoes. \nIndia has identified 15 weapon systems for exports including Astra beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, Prahar surface-to-surface missile, light combat aircraft (LCA), BrahMos supersonic cruise missile , sonars, Arjun Mk-2 tanks, airborne early warning and control systems, a variety of unmanned systems and battlefield radars. \nIndia has set a target of exporting weapons and systems worth $2 billion by 2019, six times the size of India’s current exports. The government has allowed defence PSUs to earmark 10% of their production for exports to help India increase its defence exports. PSUs could earlier export only after meeting the demands of the Indian armed forces. \nBhaskar said the orders were unlikely to be very big but it would help India get a foothold in the global market. \nLast week at Aero India-2017 , BDL signed a memorandum of understanding with French firm Thales to assess the opportunity for the transfer of technology of the laser-guided STARStreak missile to India. \n“Through this MoU, Thales and BDL seek to jointly offer a “Make in India” solution to help service growing international demand for this product,” said a Thales release. The missile, with three laser-guided darts, cannot be jammed by any known counter measure and can down even armoured helicopters. \nThe Make in India plan seeks to cut the country’s dependence on imported weapons and position the country as a hub of defence manufacturing. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:12:58.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
