He was told that, according to their records, he had died of natural causes on July 29. \n\"I was devastated when the home affairs official told me that I was really dead. I honestly thought it was a joke.\" \nID still worked \nHe grew concerned when three insurance companies stopped paying his monthly pension annuity. Meyer, a manager at an air-conditioning company, said the matter dragged on for two years. He escalated the matter to Minister Malusi Gigaba’s office. \n\"What is strange is that I still had my ID and I could use it. During the whole ordeal I went out of the country to visit my children more than five times. I went to all the airports and they never said anything to me. I could not believe it. I was the walking dead, my wife used to say,\" Meyer quipped. \nWhat concerned him most was what his wife would do if he really died. \n\"How would she prove that I had died, twice? She would never be financially compensated by the insurance companies.\" \nAfter being sent from pillar to post for two years, Meyer returned to home affairs and refused to leave until the matter was sorted out. \n\"We look back now and we laugh about it, but two weeks ago, I told them to sort it out.\" \nMeyer said he was happy to be \"alive again\". \n\"I could not get a sound explanation as to what happened with my identity. I do suspect that something fraudulent happened and we were lucky enough to find out about it before I really died.\" Join the conversation! \n24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 .
