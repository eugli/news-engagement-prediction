Megan had around half of it over a period of four or five hours. \n“She was due to stay out overnight but came back home just before midnight because she was feeling sick. \n“She was still texting her friends Happy New Year, and I went up to bed with her to make sure she was settled. I stayed with her and I did notice she was trying to lie on her back when she was half asleep so I put her in the recovery position. \n“When she settled down, I went downstairs.” Read More Boozy fish factory worker jailed after biting off half of colleague's ear at all-night party \nNext morning, on Jan 1, 2014, her mother made the horrific discovery she had died in her sleep. \nDetermined Joanne now hopes to take her message into schools to warn teenagers about drinks like Frosty Jack’s, which are targeted at a young audience and often drank by under 18’s. “I want to make them aware because these drinks are clearly something kids get access to,” she explained. \n“Teenagers and young adults need to know how dangerous it can be. You see them buying it or looking for it in corner shops. It has been going on for generations. Under 18s are not supposed to buy it, but they do get their hands on it and it is so dangerous.” \nJoanne, who believes Megan’s drink was brought to the party by an 18-year-old, wants lessons to be learned from the tragedy. \n“I am doing this for Megan. I want to make a difference for her,” she said. “If hearing about my experience can save just one life, then it is worth it. A three-litre bottle of Frosty Jack’s contains the equivalent of 22 SHOTS of vodka... yet costs just 16p per unit of alcohol (Photo: Iceland) \n“I hope that people will read this or hear her story and think ‘what about that girl?’ when they see this drink on sale in the shops. \n“Megan is giving me the energy to go ahead and do this.” \nDoing well in her GCSE studies at Cramlington Learning Village, Megan had already decided that she wanted to be a history teacher. \nJoanne has been invited to talk to MPs in the House of Commons today as a guest of the Balance, the North East Alcohol Office, which is campaigning to raise awareness of the dangers of cheap booze. \n“I don’t think parents realise how much alcohol is in these ciders,” said Joanne. \nLast year, a UK study found three-litre bottles of 7.5 per cent Frosty Jack’s cider on sale for £3.49. With each bottle containing 22.5 units of alcohol, the cost per unit was just 16 pence.

Read More Drunken thug who savagely attacked pet pooch told court: 'I love animals, I was just on a bender' \nThe AHA team also found a wide range of cheap booze being sold by major supermarkets - including Asda , Tesco and Sainsbury’s. \nTheir report said: “Both Asda and Tesco were found to be selling perry at 19p per unit, while Morrisons were selling cider at 20p per unit and Sainsbury’s stocked perry at 22p per unit. \n“In our research, we also found an abundance of summer-focused promotions. \nThe promotions included deals on multi-packs and free giveaways with alcohol purchases, enticing people to buy.” \nThe report said that for the cost of a standard off-peak cinema ticket (£8.24), people could buy 7.5 litres of the cheapest white cider - the equivalent of 53 shots of vodka. \nThe study went on: “The minimum hourly wage for those aged under 18 is £3.87. After just an hour’s work, you would still have 38p change after buying a three-litre bottle of Frosty Jack’s containing 22.5 units of alcohol. \n“For the cost of a monthly Netflix subscription at £7.49, you would have change from buying two three-litre bottles of Frosty Jack’s.” \nEach year, there are almost 23,000 deaths and more than one million hospital admissions related to alcohol in England. Aston Manor, the company which makes Frosty Jack’s, has a six per cent golden apple version of the cider and a 4 per cent ‘mixed berry’ drink. \nIt is the largest independent cider maker in the UK, and owns, markets and distributes a range of cider brands globally. \nAn Aston Manor spokesman said: \"Firstly I would like to pass on our sincere condolences to Megan’s family and friends for their devastating loss. We completely understand why Joanne has decided to campaign for an end to the misery caused by alcohol misuse. \n“We’re ready and willing to work with all interested parties to seek effective solutions to what is often a complex problem. \n“As a drinks producer we cannot control retail prices. We are also not present at the point of purchase so cannot control who alcohol is sold to, but we recognise the consistent downward trend in under-aged consumption. \n\"Any form of alcohol is capable of being misused. We believe it is unfair to level unwarranted criticism at specific brands. For a product like Frosty Jack’s, there is a great deal of mythology in terms of its consumer base and occasions when enjoyed.\" \nHe added recent research suggested typical Frosty Jack's consumers were 'middle-aged men', and that white cider represents less than half of one per cent of total alcohol sold.
