We definitely think we can see a light at the end of the tunnel now. \n“Everything’s going along really well to be quite honest. I’m not quite sure whether to say we’re on track because we’ve never really had a track that was clear. It was all pretty blurry along the way.” \nSmith faces another gruelling campaign, with the World Cup to end in early December, but the Maroons captain has no interest in sitting out games. \n“I feel good, I’m mentally fresh,” he said. \n“Origin does take a lot out of me, but as long as my mindset is OK, I will make myself available for every game. \n“If the medical staff and Craig feel it’s beneficial for me to sit out games, I will consider it, but I hate missing games. I’d like to play every game to be honest.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T10:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T05:34:33.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
