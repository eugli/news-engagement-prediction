Without explanation the central bank introduced the 5 US bond note last week, instead of next month as had been promised. \nWhen the bond note was first brought in, the central bank said the amount of the paper currency that individual Zimbabweans would have in their possession should never exceed 19 US and so there would be no opportunity for the black market to resurface. \nThat's just not happening: if you are lucky enough to get cashback at a major retailer, your 40 US will likely comprise 30 US worth of bond notes, News24 saw last week. \nAnd in yet more evidence of things getting tighter, Standard Bank Zimbabwe has just informed its clients they can't use their Visa cards when they travel outside the country. \nA statement says you can apply to the bank for \"special consideration\" but that provision offers little comfort: clients must submit a detailed list of everything they expect to spend their money on an outside trip. Because of the Zimbabwe shortage of cash, some have been travelling to countries in the region to try to access cash from their accounts there for use back home. \nBank cards \nCommenting on Twitter on these worsening shortages, prominent law lecturer and commentator Alex Magaisa said it was \"foreseeable\". He referred to Gresham's Law, which says that bad (or less valuable) money eventually drives out good (or more valuable) money. \nAt the moment \"banked\" Zimbabweans - and that is by far from most of the population - rely on bank cards to pay bills and supermarkets. If the black market for USD reemerges in a big way, that may no longer be an option. \nUS-based Professor Steve Hanke, who monitored the dizzying freefall of Zimbabwe's dollar in the pre-2008 era, has warned that bond notes will likely suffer the same fate. \nWhat he's seeing now simply confirms his predictions. He tweeted on Tuesday: \"Reserve Bank of Zim's bond notes are a joke.\" \nMany Zimbabweans already know that. | \n  .
