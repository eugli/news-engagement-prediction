At present, there isn't a vaccine for scarlet fever.\n- Symptoms usually clear up after a week and the majority of cases will resolve without complication as long as the recommended course of antibiotics is completed.\nLast updated Fri 17 Feb 2017 Health", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:30:36.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
