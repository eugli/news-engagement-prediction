Heller explicitly excluded from such coverage. \nMaryland Attorney General Brian Frosh led the push to pass the law in 2013. He praised the ruling, describing it as \"very strong.\" \nMaryland passed a sweeping gun-control measure after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre that killed 20 children and six educators in Connecticut.
