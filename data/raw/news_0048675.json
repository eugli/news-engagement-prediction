It’s really a matter of how much McKenzie is going to be cooperating and be out and about in the area we’re looking.”\nHiring the drone operators from Great Lakes Drone Company, based in Watervliet, is the latest tactic Booth has tried to find McKenzie since the treeing walker coonhound bolted from her friend’s yard in Ferndale after firecrackers went off in the neighborhood.\nShe’s posted countless flyers, hired a dog tracker from Ohio and started a Facebook page , which connected her with many of the volunteers on hand for Sunday’s search party.\nBuy Photo Matt Quinn, center, and Cynthia Booth, right, view a monitor showing the view from above from a drone.

(Photo: Joe Guillen/Detroit Free Press)\nBooth, 33, of Troy, said she gets about a dozen credible calls a month from people who have seen her dog. McKenzie has been spotted in Warren, Bloomfield Hills and Troy, but the dog is very timid and runs away from people when they try to catch her, Booth said. She urges people to call or text her at 586-604-6555 if McKenzie is seen.\nMatt Quinn, owner of Great Lakes Drone Company, used a hand-held remote control to operate one of the drones looking for McKenzie Sunday. A monitor showing a bird’s-eye-view from the drone’s perspective was attached to Quinn’s control.\n\"We found a lot of loose dogs but none of them have been McKenzie,\" Quinn said. “We’re trying to give it our all in a short amount of time to check everything.\"\nAnimal rescue is one of several services Quinn’s company offers.\nUnder Federal Aviation Administration regulations, Quinn said, drones have to stay within eye sight of the operator — usually between a quarter- and half-mile — and within 400 feet of the ground.\nRelated news:\nNew drone rules apply to business, not hobbyists — yet\nRare underwater drone inspired by Michigan lake\nGreat Lakes Drone typically would turn down a request from an owner whose dog has been missing for eight months, Quinn said. But information from the dog tracker that McKenzie was in the area recently and the strong community support convinced him to take the job. His company charges $50 an hour plus travel expenses for animal rescue work.\nKatherine Hayes was among the volunteers ready to form a perimeter around McKenzie if one of the drones located her. Hayes, 63, of Birmingham, found out about the search for McKenzie through Facebook.\n“The thing I think that drew me the most, (McKenzie) was local and immediately I started seeing how much support there was in the community,” Hayes said.\nBooth said frequent sightings of McKenzie keep her hopeful. The dog was most recently seen Thursday, Booth said. Using information from the sightings, Booth sets up feeding stations to lure McKenzie back.\nDuring her search, Booth has become a foster owner of another coonhound she found about a month ago in the area of Gratiot Avenue and East 9 Mile Road.\n“I’m in good spirits as long as I’m hearing things and she’s still out there,” Booth said.\nIf you would like to donate to Booth's search for McKenzie, go here .\nContact Joe Guillen: 313-222-6678, jguillen@freepress.com or on Twitter @joeguillen.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/19/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/636231141474417309-drone-pic-1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2017/02/19/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/636231141474417309-drone-pic-1.jpg", "https://www.crowdrise.com/help-track-mac1", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f2d4ceca58a6a0c73acc03cf81ff9b74a2332db/c=4-0-3260-2448&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2017/02/19/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/636231141474417309-drone-pic-1.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/FindingMcKenzie/"], "published": "2017-02-20T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:38:04.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
