Beyonce Makes MAJOR Pregnancy Announcement on Instagram 1:48 \nThe Carter family is getting a whole lot bigger! Beyonce has announced she's PREGNANT! WITH TWINS! Stop everything - Queen Bey is having a baby! Or better yet, two babies. Beyonce made a very special announcement on her Instagram account today. Sharing a simply gorgeous photo, holding her large baby bump, the 35-year-old singer said this. ?We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two. And we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters.? First of all, how sweet is that announcement? Beyonce is absolutely glowing. And this is quite a change from her first pregnancy announcement 5 years ago. In true Beyonce fashion, the singer surprised everyone and debuted her baby bump on the red carpet at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2011. This time last year, Beyonce fans speculated she was expecting when she emerged from Super Bowl halftime show rehearsals wearing a large coat. And just a few months earlier, the singer tried to hide her belly with large objects and baggy clothing. Alas, no bump. Until NOW! And one thing is for sure - we KNOW Beyonce and Jay Z are over the moon about their newest additions. Beyonce has countless reasons to be proud of herself in her career, but all of her accomplishments have been overshadowed by motherhood. Talking to garage magazine last year, the singer said, ?Out of everything I?ve accomplished, my proudest moment hands down was when I gave birth to my daughter Blue.? Awww, so sweet!
