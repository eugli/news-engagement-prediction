It is home to more than 200,000 refugees [File: Reuters] \nKenya's high court has said it would be unconstitutional to close the world's biggest refugee camp, which houses more than 200,000 people who have fled war in neighbouring Somalia. \nIn a ruling on Thursday, the court said a government order to shut the camp, which would have sent the refugees back to Somalia from the sprawling Dadaab camp, was illegal. \nJudge John Mativo, who issued the ruling, said Kenya's internal security minister had abused his power by ordering the closure of the camp, which borders Somalia, in May last year. \nAccording to Mativo, the order had been given without consulting the people who would be directly affected by its implications, which was a violation of Kenya's constitutional right to fair legal proceedings. \n\"Hence, the said decision is null and void,\" he ruled.

In June, Somalia's ambassador to the US critisised the plan and said it would damage relations between Kenya and Somalia. \nThe government had denied that it would be abandoning refugees , saying it had made arrangements with the Somali government to resettle them. \nIn November, the closure was delayed by six months after calls by foreign nations to postpone it on humanitarian grounds.
