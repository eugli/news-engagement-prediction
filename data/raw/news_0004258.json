In my high school, my librarian. Just some of my friends’ parents' mothers. They’ve been helpful to me in so many different ways and they stood up for me at every opportunity, so that was my opportunity to stand up for them and to show that I care for them. And also those issues are important to me as well.\" \nRead more: Detroit Lions' Sam Martin: Matt Prater could make 70-yard FG in game \nBademosi and fellow Detroit Lions Anquan Boldin and Glover Quin are scheduled to take part in the Ross Initiative in Sports for Equality town hall meeting this Friday, where the group will host a panel discussion on race relations and activism by athletes. \nBoldin and Quin traveled to Washington D.C. last year during the season to discuss race issues with members of Congress, and Bademosi and linebacker DeAndre Levy attended the rally the day after President Donald Trump's inauguration. \n\"It was amazing,\" Bademosi said. \"It was amazing to see 500,000 women in D.C. alone, and I think across the world. In Paris, in London, in all these places across the world there were women marching and speaking up about what’s important to them. And that’s just, like I was saying, you’d be blind not to see what’s going on in this country and for me to not speak on it I feel like that’d be ridiculous. I see it and I care about it, so why not?\" \nAsked why he felt women's rights were in peril, Bademosi paused to choose his words carefully. \n\"OK, so where do I start?\" Bademosi said. \"What if somebody told you, 'Hey,' - and I’m going to choose my words carefully – 'you’re not allowed to have sex or ejaculate unless you’re going to have kids. You can’t do that.' That’s kind of like, 'Wait, hold on a second.' That’s kind of limiting. You see women’s reproductive rights, health rights, I don’t even know. So many different ways, I don’t know where to start.\" \nRead more: New immigration-ban lawsuit: 'Trump does not trump the Constitution' \nBademosi, the son of two immigrants who met after they moved to America, said it's important for him to stay involved in social issues \"for so many different reasons.\" \n\"If you were to talk to some people they’d say, 'Oh, just be quiet and play your sports,'\" Bademosi said. \"But it’s hard to. I’m a citizen of this country, I’m a member of my community and things that happen, decisions that are made, whether it’s an executive order here or something, decisions that aren’t made by the president, made by other people in Congress, or things that happen in the community, whether it’s with police or whatever, it affects me. And I see it happening. So I’d be remiss to ignore that. I feel like I have to speak on that. I feel like that’s part of my purpose.\" \nTo that end, Bademosi said he opposes the refugee ban on seven Muslim-majority nations put in place by Trump last month. \n\"It seems like a Muslim ban more than an immigration ban,\" Bademosi said. \"I think it’s ridiculous.\" \nBademosi, who's traveled to places to Brazil, Egypt and Turkey in recent years to teach football with the group American Football Without Borders, said he hopes to impact change on a domestic level through Friday's panel discussion and in similar future events. \n\"In so many ways I see what’s going on and how it affects people,\" Bademosi said. \"I don’t see it as a far off thing that’s not going to affect me because it does affect me. And if you believe it might not affect you then you need to pay more attention.\" \nContact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com.
