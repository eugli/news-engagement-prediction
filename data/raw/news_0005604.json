The club has not confirmed this report. \nCoghlan, 31, played well with the Cubs in 2014-15 (.793 OPS in 935 plate appearances) before being traded to the A's last February to make room for Dexter Fowler . He got traded back to the Cubs in June and hit .252 with one home run, 16 RBIs and a .779 OPS in 128 plate appearances the rest of the way. He also had eight plate appearances in the postseason, in which the Cubs won the World Series. \nOdubel Herrera , Howie Kendrick and Michael Saunders are expected to be the Phillies' Opening Day outfielders. Aaron Altherr is a good bet to be the fourth outfielder. Coghlan and fellow non-roster invitee Daniel Nava figure to be the top competitors to be the fifth. Tyler Goeddel also could be in the mix. \nCoghlan, who bats left-handed, has hit .260 with a .736 OPS in an eight-year career with the Marlins, A's and Cubs. Nava, who is a switch-hitter, has hit .262 with a .727 OPS in a six-year career with the Red Sox, Rays, Angels and Royals. \nOther outfielders in camp include top prospects Dylan Cozens , Roman Quinn and Nick Williams . But each is expected to begin the season with Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Prospects Cameron Perkins and Andrew Pullin also will be in camp as non-roster invitees. They also are likely to begin the season in the Minor Leagues.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:03:57.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
