Competing for students \nThere has also been a decline in UK students applying - and like the two previous occasions when applications have fallen - this has been when fees are being increased. \nThe fall in applications in England of 6% has been three times greater than in Scotland at 2%, which remains without tuition fees. \nApplications from Wales fell most, by 7%, and Northern Ireland by 5%. \nNursing had the biggest fall of any individual subject, and Janet Davies, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, blamed this on the switch from grants to fees and loans. \n\"We warned the government the removal of student funding would see a sharp drop in nursing applications. These figures confirm our worst fears,\" said Ms Davies. \nShe said the \"nursing workforce is in crisis\". \nBut there were drops across other subjects - particularly among older students not applying directly from school. \nAmong 19-year-olds, numbers were down 9%. And among 25-year-olds, applications were down 23%. \nBut among 18-year-olds, such as sixth-formers applying from school, numbers have continued to rise to record levels, up to 37% of the age group. \nAnd there could be an upside for those who are seeking places - with universities likely to be competing to attract students. 'Disappointing' \nUcas chief Mary Curnock Cook said this \"tough recruitment environment for universities\" would mean \"unprecedented choice and opportunity for applicants\". \nSorana Vieru, vice-president of the National Union of Students, said the fall in applicants was \"disappointing, but not a surprise\". \n\"Uncertainty around increases in tuition fees, loss of maintenance grants and the rising costs of living and studying at university are too much of a risk to some potential students,\" she said. \nUniversities Minister Jo Johnson said: \"More young people than ever are choosing to go to university, with record application rates for 18-year-olds this year as well as those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:46:24.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
