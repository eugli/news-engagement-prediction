Photo: Andrew Wu \n\"I haven't really seen a wicket like that before a Test match so I think it is going to take a lot of spin and potentially some up and down movement for the fast bowlers as well.\" \nDespite the spin-friendly conditions, there remains the question of what a third spinner can do for Australia that their best two cannot. Smith remembers how difficult it was four years ago when Ravi Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Pragyan Ojha spun rings around Michael Clarke's side. Agar, Swepson and Glenn Maxwell, however, are yet to show they are in that class. \n\"When someone started to look a little bit comfortable against one of the spinners they'd just change it and bowl someone else,\" Smith said. \n\"And then when they start looking comfortable against them they go back. And you can chop and change and not let the batter get in a bit of a rhythm against a spinner. I guess that's part of the thinking behind potentially playing three spinners. But we'll wait and see.\" \nDespite the probable spin-friendly conditions, Smith believes reverse swing remains a major part of Australia's armoury. The abrasive pitch combined with six practice wickets on the square should ensure the SG ball quickly loses its shine. \nReverse swing comes into play a lot sooner in India. When Bangladesh played this month they found the most difficult periods to bat were between overs 10 and 45 when the ball was still relatively hard then easing from the 50th over as the ball softened. \nThe spin/pace balance is a call Australia cannot afford to get wrong as it would be a major error if they were a paceman short while the ball played tricks. Pace is also wonderbat Virat Kohli's least strongest suit - to say he has a weakness would be doing him a disservice. \n\"Attacking the stumps is going to be pretty important probably. And when you take one side of the bat out as well, I think you can be a lot easier to play as a batter so reverse swing is going to be key, to get it going - particularly when the ball is a little bit harder,\" Smith said. \n\"I still think that the fast bowlers will be able to get the ball to reverse quite quickly. But it's going to spin there's no doubt about that - I'm pretty certain about that.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:33:59.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
