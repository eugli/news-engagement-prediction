Ad Feedback \nMaru and the associate settled on a price of $550 for half a gram of methamphetamine. \nLater, the same associate asked if he could get a \"Q\", or a quarter gram of methamphetamine, police said. \nOn October 2, Maru text messaged an associate to say he was trying to sell \"ding\". \n\"Is da garlic bread a good size?\" the associate asked. \n\"Skunk,\" Maru replied. Skunk was a type of cannabis grown under indoor lights, police said. \nMaru sold cannabis and methamphetamine on eight more occasions during October using the words \"ding\" and \"Q\". \nHe also used \"pool que\" and \"chicken\" in reference to methamphetamine. \nWhen spoken to by police, Maru admitted he was using codenames to sell cannabis and methamphetamine. \nHe appeared at the Blenheim District Court on Tuesday, where he admitted six charges of offering to sell methamphetamine, and 10 of offering to sell cannabis. \nHis lawyer Rob Harrison said the amount of drugs sold was minor compared to other drug dealers that came before the courts. \nMaru had struggled with addiction for years but had stopped using drugs since he was charged, Harrison said. \nHe had arranged to see a drug and alcohol counsellor, and was considering entering a residential rehabilitation programme, Harrison said. \nMaru had cannabis-related charges in his criminal history but nothing involving methamphetamine. \nJudge David Ruth remanded him on bail to be sentenced on April 4. - The Marlborough Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:34:58.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
