When our poll asked voters which words they most associated with Donald Trump , the most popular were “dangerous” (50%), “unstable” (39%) and “bigot” (35%). More than half of British adults polled (54%) expect Trump to be a below average (10%) or awful (44%) president. Sixty-four per cent believe that Trump is a threat to international stability and 56% say he isn’t trustworthy.\nEven Ukip voters, who are generally the most positive towards the new president, are more lukewarm than enthusiastic. Although 53% of Ukip voters expect Trump to be an above average or great president, the most commonly selected word associated with him is still “dangerous” (26%), followed by “intelligent” (24%).\nHowever, while they do not respect the man, voters respect the position Trump occupies. The US is overwhelmingly seen by the public as Britain’s most important ally. Out of a list of 13 options, 50% selected the United States compared with just 9% selecting the second most popular answer, Germany. Commonwealth stalwarts such as Australia and Canada fared even worse with 5% and 3% respectively.\nForty per cent of voters agreed with the statement: “Brexit means we have no choice but to keep strong ties with the USA”, while 58% agreed that it’s in Britain’s interests for the USA to continue to be a powerful nation.\nThere is also the feeling that Trump represents an opportunity for Britain in a way that he does not for other countries. When asked how Trump will have an impact on American relations with a number of countries and international bodies, the consensus is that the new president will be bad for relations with Nato (45% v 13% saying good), with the European Union (53% v 8%), China (50% v 9%), Germany (48% v 8%) and France (44% v 10%). In contrast, 33% expect Trump to be good for relations with Britain (v 30% who expect them to get worse), putting us in such illustrious company as Russia, where 37% expect Trump to improve relations and just 24% expect him to make them worse.\nSimilarly, 37% agree that Trump “is a friend of Britain” v 30% who disagree.\nThis is perhaps why Theresa May’s controversial offer of a state visit has produced a more nuanced reaction. When asked to consider the offer and Trump’s executive order banning entry to the US from seven Muslim-majority countries, 36% say the visit should go ahead regardless, 25% that it should be delayed until after the policy expires and 28% that it should be cancelled outright.\nIn any case, May’s proximity to President Trump does not yet appear to be inflicting the same damage that perceptions of being “George Bush’s poodle” inflicted on Tony Blair. Fifty-five per cent say that the prime minister is strong enough to stand up for Britain’s interests when dealing with the US v only 22% saying the same about Jeremy Corbyn.\nCloseness to Trump, though, should not mean spurning other allies. Given the unreliability of the new president and his “America first” agenda, it’s not surprising that 49% say Britain should focus on improving ties with other allies rather than the US and just 29% believe that US-UK relations will be stronger under Trump than under Barack Obama.\nThe general view of how to handle the Trump administration therefore is: a Trump-led US is still the US but Britain should shore up our other alliances and be prepared in case the new president’s direction leaves us isolated.\nComments will be opened later", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:32:11.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
