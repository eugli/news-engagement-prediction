Sabi Abdullahi, said that the development was capable of endangering the relationship between Nigeria and South Africa. SENATE CHAMBER \nHe recounted Nigeria’s contributions and sacrifice to liberate South Africa from the clutches of apartheid, saying that enormous resources were spent by Nigeria to set that country free. \n“It doesn’t tell well about our relationship with South Africa dating back to history. \n“The government of South Africa should rise up to the occasion and call these young people to order, and let them know what Nigeria contributed in their quest for freedom. \n“We have our own problems to cater for. Nigerians deserve better treatment,” Abdullahi said. \nSupporting the spokesman, Sen. Dino Melaye (APC-Kogi) urged the government to have a citizens-based foreign policy. \n“Citizens’ diplomacy should be the focus of our foreign policy. Nigeria must defend Nigerians anywhere in the world,” he said.
