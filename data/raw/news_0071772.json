Slot to Mississippi Links \nThe foundation of Hugh Freeze's football program at Ole Miss is taking some pounding. In a matter-of-factly somber video release, Ole Miss leadership announced what would be a one-year bowl ban at minimum for the football program. But more sanctions are likely to follow. \nThe news is no surprise but still a hard pill to swallow for a program that was just starting to taste big-stage success. \nFreeze and Ole Miss have been weathering this storm for a while now. The 2017 recruiting class, 12th in the SEC per the 247Sports Composite Team Recruiting Rankings, is evidence of that. A sorry 2016 season that began with high hopes and ended with a 5-7 record may have been the result of some of those nasty winds. But regardless of what the weather holds, the foundation can withstand increased wind speed because of quarterback Shea Patterson's presence in Oxford. \nWe have a few recent examples to reference in making that statement. \nTake Christian Hackenberg, who had a tumultuous career at Penn State but he will always be one of the most important Nittany Lions to come through State College because of the former five-star's decision to stick with his commitment despite impending NCAA sanctions. He gave Nittany Lion nation some stability and helped it survive until the clouds parted. \n\"At the end of the day, if there's football at Penn State, I'm going to be there,\" Hackenberg said in 2012 when he was a recruit with the option to play anywhere he wanted. \nSouthern Cal received the harshest NCAA penalties since SMU's Death Penalty in the summer of 2010 and it was fortunate to have Matt Barkley on campus when that hammer fell. After at least 11 wins in six of the previous seven seasons, Lane Kiffin took over as the USC head coach but it was Barkley that was the face. Amid turmoil, scholarship reductions and postseason bans, Barkley help keep things afloat and battled for four years in Los Angeles while recruiting continued to find success because of it. \n\"This is not unchartered territory for us, for this team,\" Barkley said at a press conference the day the sanctions were announced, joined by then-AD Pat Haden, company that underlined how important a leader Barkley was for the Trojans. \nWhile no one ever thought USC and Penn State would be down forever, they may still be a few years away from a marvelous shootout like we saw in January's Rose Bowl if not for those two quarterbacks. \nShea Patterson bears the same yoke in Oxford. \nThe talent on the Ole Miss roster is going to dip. It started in the 2017 recruiting cycle with a No. 30 finish in the recruiting rankings. It will be tough for Ole Miss to replicate any of its recent recruiting success in this cycle thanks to Wednesday's news. But there is talent currently on the roster. In particular, there's offensive line talent and there's wide receiver talent. \nThose are two good tools at Patterson's disposal. He was the No. 1 quarterback in the nation in the 2016 class. He is a dynamic talent and he already flashed some brilliance even as a partially prepared starter late in the 2016 season. Remember his Manziel-like debut against Texas A&M in November? \nPatterson's ability to keep Ole Miss swinging over the next couple of seasons is the bridge it needs to get well on the other side of this. He's got the talent to be that kind of elevating force. He's got the intangibles and mentality to keep the roster competing. He's got the calm to be the program's face. \nI saw all of that during a week of practice for the U.S. Army All-American Game last year. Guys are drawn to Patterson. He's a tremendous competitor. \nWednesday, assuredly, will not go down as a good day for Ole Miss. But Patterson ensures there's better days on the horizon.
