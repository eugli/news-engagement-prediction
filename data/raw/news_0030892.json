A statement on Prince’s behalf at the time read: “Prince strongly believes artists as the creators and owners of their music need to reclaim their art.” \nNow, Prince’s music will be available to anyone who has access to any streaming service, with Purple Rain and the rest of his body of work spreading across cyberspace. \nThe development is an appropriately timed one, coinciding with Sunday night’s Grammy Awards where Bruno Mars performed a wonderful tribute to Prince, while dressed in a classic purple-sequin get-up. If this puts you in the mood to listen to Prince, well, you’re in luck.
