When I complained at one of your branches, the response turned me off, telling me to download the bank app. Even, when I downloaded the app with my Sterling Bank registered phone number, I still didn’t get it after promising to send my app with pin code with which I use to register it. Up till now, I am yet to receive the pin code. You people should be customer- oriented. \nSterling Bank response \nHello \nOlasunkanmi, thank you for contacting us.
