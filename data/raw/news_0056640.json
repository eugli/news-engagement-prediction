Even those who recover from the initial illness often struggle with language impairment, memory difficulties and personality changes. \nFriends and family may find it difficult to understand what is going on with their loved ones. “Barely anyone has heard of encephalitis. The lack of a shared narrative can be isolating,” Dr. Toledano says. \nFor Thesing, the past three years have been a journey toward recovery. She spent nearly three weeks in intensive care and a month at Mayo Clinic’s inpatient rehabilitation facility in physical, occupational and speech therapy. When she returned home, Thesing continued outpatient rehabilitation for about 10 months. \n“I’m so lucky I have the family I do,” says Thesing, who has resumed her real estate career and is grateful for supportive co-workers. “I’m still asking questions as I’m learning more about the disease. Almost a year of my life is missing.” \nOf her time at Mayo Clinic, Thesing says: “I was where I needed to be. They knew right away what to do.” \nMayo Clinic in 2006 created the nation’s first autoimmune neurology clinic specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of encephalitis. Mayo Clinic’s Clinical Neuroimmunology Laboratory tests more than 150,000 patients annually for antibodies targeting the nervous system. \n### \nAbout Mayo Clinic Mayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization committed to clinical practice, education and research, providing expert, whole-person care to everyone who needs healing.
