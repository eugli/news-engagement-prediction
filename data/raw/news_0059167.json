Will we see a split between Best Picture and Best Director? Who will win in some tight lead acting categories? And for serious Oscar geeks: Will either Kevin O’Connell or Greg P. Russell — sound men who are a combined for a record 0-for-36 at previous ceremonies — finally win an Academy Award?\nThese are just a few storylines to watch heading into the 89th Academy Awards this Sunday, Feb. 26. Expect La La Land to win a la la lot of trophies, but there could be some surprises in store. We’re calling upsets in Best Director, Best Actor, Best Documentary, and Best Original Song, but who knows what else the night could bring? Here are our 2017 Oscar predictions in every category.\nBEST PICTURE\n\nNominees:\nArrival\nFences\nHacksaw Ridge\nHell or High Water\nHidden Figures\nLa La Land\nLion\nManchester by the Sea\nMoonlight \nLa La Land tied an Academy Awards record when it scored a whopping 14 nominations, out Oscaring Gone With the Wind (13) and taking its place in history alongside Titanic and All About Eve . That put to rest any doubt that director Damien Chazelle’s contemporary musical is far and away the Best Picture frontrunner , a status I’ve been sure about since September. There’s plenty else working in its favor beyond nomination domination: It’s an enchanting love letter to Los Angeles, the metropolis where most Oscar voters live and work; it romanticizes the entertainment industry; it reinvigorates a genre long celebrated on the ceremony’s stage; and it features two of Hollywood’s most popular young stars, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.\nLike any film that popular though, there’s been some inevitable backlash . That leaves open the possibility that something like Moonlight , Barry Jenkins’ quietly stunning coming-of-age drama could squeak out a win. And if there’s any film that’s stock has increased since the nominations, it would be the sleeper hit Hidden Figures , which will pass $150 million at the U.S. box office by the time the Oscars air on Sunday and would make a more populist (if conventional) pick. Still, anything topping La La Land would be a major upset.\nWill Win: La La Land\nDon’t Be Surprised By : Moonlight\nDark Horse: Hidden Figures \n\n\nBEST DIRECTOR \nNominees:\nDamien Chazelle, La La Land\nMel Gibson, Hacksaw Ridge\nBarry Jenkins, Moonlight\nKenneth Lonergan, Manchester by the Sea\nDenis Villeneuve, Arrival \nThe five gentlemen nominated for Best Director should be thankful that Alejandro González Iñárritu didn’t make a film last year and is not a threat to three-peat after consecutive wins for Birdman and The Revenant. (PSA: No woman has been nominated in this category since Kathryn Bigelow won in 2010.)\nAgain, this one comes down to La La Land versus Moonlight . Director’s Guild winner Chazelle is the favorite, no doubt, for his highly stylized, resourceful work. But while Best Picture and Best Director Oscars in most years go to the same film (over a 30-year span from 1983-2012, it’s happened 25 times), splits have been a trend of late, occurring in three out of the past four years. I could see Jenkins get rewarded here for his stunning work in Moonlight .\nWill Win: Barry Jenkins\nDon’t Be Surprised By : Damien Chazelle\nBEST ACTRESS \nNominees:\nIsabelle Huppert, Elle\nRuth Negga, Loving\nNatalie Portman, Jackie\nEmma Stone, La La Land\nMeryl Streep, Florence Foster Jenkins \nOf the acting races, this is the category with the most possible winners at four. (Apologies to Loving ’s Ruth Negga.) Stone is the favorite for her emotionally charged performance as Mia, the heart and soul of La La Land . But watch out for Elle ’s Isabelle Huppert, who pulled off a surprise win at the Golden Globes and could be a sentimental pick. Streep has to be a contender considering Hollywood wouldn’t mind a repeat of her takedown of Donald Trump at the Globes… and also, she’s Meryl Streep, 20-time nominee. Many critics have called Natalie Portman’s performance in Jackie her career-best, but she did win only six years ago for Black Swan . That brings us back to Stone, who you could argue is already “due” at the tender age of 28: She should’ve won two years ago for supporting actress in Birdman .\nWill Win: Emma Stone\nDon’t Be Surprised By: Isabelle Huppert\nDark Horse: Natalie Portman or Meryl Streep\n\n\nBEST ACTOR \nNominees:\nCasey Affleck, Manchester by the Sea\nAndrew Garfield, Hacksaw Ridge\nRyan Gosling, La La Land\nViggo Mortensen, Captain Fantastic\nDenzel Washington, Fences \nRead More It felt like Casey Affleck had this category locked up earlier this awards season for playing the tormented handyman who assumes custody of his wiseacre nephew (Lucas Hedges) in Manchester . But the tide seems to have turned of late. Voters might be hesitant to reward Affleck given attention to sexual harassment allegations lodged against him by female colleagues in 2010. (The cases were settled, and Affleck has denied the claims.) Now, a real possibility is Denzel Washington, who won the Screen Actors Guild Award and could win his third Oscar for playing a Pittsburgh sanitation worker in Fences . While Affleck’s performance is understated, Washington’s is explosive. It’s still Affleck’s Oscar to lose, but I’m going with Denzel.\nWill Win: Denzel Washington\nDon’t Be Surprised By: Casey Affleck\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS \nNominees:\nViola Davis, Fences\nNaomie Harris, Moonlight\nNicole Kidman, Lion\nOctavia Spencer, Hidden Figures\nMichelle Williams, Manchester by the Sea \nOf the four acting categories, this one is by far the easiest one to predict. There is next to no doubt Viola Davis will take home her first Academy Award for her fiery performance opposite Washington in Fences . Davis owns the single greatest moment by any actor this year with her tear-soaked “standing with you” rebuttal of her wrongdoing husband. Any other year, and this prize would have to go to Michelle Williams for her gut-wrenching work in Manchester , but the Dawson’s Creek alum will likely be 0-for-4 at the Oscars after Sunday.\nWill Win: Viola Davis\nDark Horse: Michelle Williams\n\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR \nNominees:\nMahershala Ali, Moonlight\nJeff Bridges, Hell or High Water\nLucas Hedges, Manchester by the Sea\nDev Patel, Lion\nMichael Shannon, Nocturnal Animals \nThis race was probably a lot closer before January 29. That was the night Moonlight breakout Mahershala Ali (who also appears in another Best Picture contender, Hidden Figures ) delivered an introspective, heartfelt speech as he accepted his SAG Award. Ali was the presumptive favorite before then for his subtly moving work as an empathetic drug dealer , and that night, he likely became a lock. I’ll still hold out hope for the feisty Michael Shannon, who gave one of my favorite performances of the year as a tough-talking, terminally ill sheriff in Nocturnal Animals , but odds are Ali is the champ.\nWill Win: Mahershala Ali\nDark Horse: Michael Shannon\nRelated: 7 First-Time Oscar Nominees in 2017 \nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY \nNominees:\nMike Mills, 20th Century Women\nTaylor Sheridan, Hell or High Water\nDamien Chazelle, La La Land\nYorgos Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou, The Lobster\nKenneth Lonergan, Manchester by the Sea \nKenneth Lonergan was recruited by Matt Damon to pen an original script after the actor-producer took a shine to his work on Margaret , and the playwright-screenwriter didn’t disappoint. Manchester by the Sea is a masterfully written tragedy that surprises and saddens, yet still leaves room for hope and even some humor. It’s hard to see this award not going to Lonergan, one of the more revered writers in the business today. La La Land in the running, but it’s incredibly rare for musicals to win screenplay Oscars: the last was Gigi in 1959.\nWill Win: Manchester by the Sea\nDon’t Be Surprised By: La La Land\nDark Horse: Hell or High Water \nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY \nNominees:\nEric Heisserer, Arrival\nAugust Wilson, Fences\nTheodore Melfi and Allison Schroeder, Hidden Figures\nLuke Davies, Lion\nBarry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney, Moonlight \nThe Writer’s Guild Awards didn’t make this category any easier to predict: Both Moonlight (written by Barry Jenkins, based on an unpublished play by Tarell McCraney) and Arrival (written by Eric Heisserer, based on a story by Ted Chiang) took home trophies. That’s because the WGA considered Moonlight an original script, while the Academy’s designated it an adaptation. Regardless, this should be smooth sailing for the deeply adored Moonlight .\nWill Win: Moonlight\nDark Horse: Arrival or Hidden Figures \nRelated: ‘ Arrival’s’ Nominated Screenwriter on Adapting the Surprise Hit and Speaking the Aliens’ Language \nBEST ANIMATED FEATURE \nNominees:\nKubo and the Two Strings\nMoana\nMy Life as a Zucchini\nThe Red Turtle\nZootopia \nIt’s still surprising that in a year in which Disney Animation released a highly anticipated sequel ( Finding Dory ) and a new heroine adventure ( Moana ), its crown jewel is Zootopia . It arrived in theaters last spring with decidedly less fanfare than the other two, but has proven a hilarious crowd-pleaser, with a poignant, nuanced social message about tolerance. Zootopia has become the easy favorite here, and only the artsier Kubo and the Two Strings has a (long) shot of defeating it.\nWill Win: Zootopia\nDark Horse: Kubo and the Two Strings \nBEST DOCUMENTARY \nNominees:\n13 th\nFire at Sea\nI Am Not Your Negro\nLife, Animated\nO.J.: Made in America \nWisdom of the crowd says the non-fiction category will go to ESPN Films�� O.J.: Made in America , Ezra Edelman’s captivating, 8-hour long odyssey about O.J. Simpson, his trial for murder, and its ripple effect on race relations in America. (At 467 minutes, it would become the film with the longest runtime ever to win an Oscar.) But my pick goes to a timelier take on social strife, Ava DuVernay’s 13th , a blistering indictment of mass incarceration and an urgent look at the evolution of racial inequality in the U.S.\nWill Win: 13th\nDon’t Be Surprised By: O.J.: Made in America\nDark Horse: I Am Not Your Negro \nRelated: The Oscar-Nominated Filmmaker Behind ‘O.J.: Made in America’ on His Oscar Night Plans and Why O.J. Still Matters \nBEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM \nNominees:\nLand of Mine\nA Man Called Ove\nThe Salesman\nTanna\nToni Erdmann \nToni Erdmann , Germany’s comedy-drama about a goofy middle-aged man who disrupts his corporate daughter’s business dealings has long been considered the movie to beat. But politics matter at the Oscars, and the attention Iran’s The Salesman — about married actors whose relationship unravels as they rehearse for a play — has received in the wake of the Trump administration’s proposed travel ban could give the second seed a bump. ( Director Asghar Farhadi announced he was boycotting the ceremony .) And for what it’s worth, The Salesman is the better film.\nWill Win: The Salesman\nDon’t Be Surprised By: Toni Erdmann\nDark Horse: A Man Called Ove \nBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY \nNominees: \nBradford Young, Arrival\nLinus Sandgren, La La Land\nGreig Fraser, Lion\nJames Laxton, Moonlight\nRodrigo Prieto, Silence \nIt was a stellar year for cinematography. There’s the dreamy urban landscapes of Moonlight , a vibrant spin on the City of Angels in La La Land , and the brooding sci-fi scenery of Arrival . You would assume any of those would be the favorites… and then American Society of Cinematographers doled out their top honors to the gritty South Asian sights photographed in Lion . This category could be ripe for an upset, but when in doubt, go La La Land .\n\n\nWill Win: La La Land\nDon’t Be Surprised By: Lion\nDark Horse: Arrival or Moonlight\n\nBEST COSTUME DESIGN \nNominees: \nJoanna Johnston, Allied\nColleen Atwood, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\nConsolata Boyle, Florence Foster Jenkins\nMadeline Fontaine, Jackie\nMary Zophres, La La Land \nThis category has a history of going to period wardrobes, and Jackie ‘s Madeline Fontaine nailed the former First Lady’s iconic looks. But La La Land is the likely frontrunner given how vitally its characters’ colorful duds factor into the film’s aesthetic.\nWill Win: La La Land\nDon’t Be Surprised By: Jackie\nDark Horse: Florence Foster Jenkins \nBEST PRODUCTION DESIGN \nNominees:\nPatrice Vermette and Paul Hotte, Arrival\nStuart Craig and Anna Pinnock, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\nJess Gonchor and Nancy Haigh, Hail, Caesar!\nDavid Wasco and Sandy Reynolds-Wasco, La La Land\nGuy Hendrix Dyas and Gene Serdena, Passengers \nBest Production Design, a.k.a. one of two categories where Passengers was nominated. (The big-budget sci-fi bust did look pretty spectacular.) This category has matched up with Best Costume Design over the last three years ( Mad Max, Grand Budapest Hotel , and The Great Gatsby ). Considering that La La Land was a spectacle that also looked spectacular, I’ll say that trend will continue.\nWill Win: La La Land\nDon’t Be Surprised By: Arrival\nDark Horse: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them \nBEST EDITING \nNominees:\nJoe Walker, Arrival\nJohn Gilbert, Hacksaw Ridge\nJake Roberts, Hell or High Water\nJoi McMillon and Nat Sanders, Moonlight\nTom Cross, La La Land \nHere’s yet another technical award where La La Land should add to its total. Editor Tom Cross won a surprise Oscar two years ago for his work on Chazelle’s breakout film Whiplash , and once again he helps craft the filmmaker’s work with perfect rhythm. If anything breaks La La Land ‘s stride here, it could be Arrival , which won the ACE Eddie Award for drama, while La La took the comedy category.\nWill Win: La La Land\nDon’t Be Surprised By: Arrival\nDark Horse: Moonlight \nBEST MAKEUP AND HAIRSTYLING \nNominees:\nEva Von Bahr and Love Larson, A Man Called Ove\nJoel Harlow and Richard Alonzo, Star Trek Beyond\nAlessandro Bertolazzi, Giorgio Gregorini and Christopher Allen Nelson, Suicide Squad \nGood news: This is the rare Oscar category where you automatically have a 33.3 percent chance of winning on your ballot. As much as we’d all get a kick out of hearing the phrase “the Oscar winning-film Suicide Squad ,” you’re probably safe picking Star Trek Beyond for its impressive intergalactic embellishments.\nWill Win: Star Trek Beyond\nDon’t Be Surprised By: Suicide Squad \nBEST SCORE \nNominees:\nMica Levi, Jackie\nJustin Hurwitz, La La Land\nDustin O’Halloran and Volker Berterlmann, Lion\nNicholas Britell, Moonlight\nThomas Newman, Passengers \nThe musical numbers are infectious in La La Land , but the film’s tunes never stop never stopping, and Justin Hurwitz’s tight, jazz-influenced compositions seamlessly blend one showstopper into the next. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: La La Land is the easy choice.\nWill Win: La La Land\nDark Horse: Lion \nBEST ORIGINAL SONG \nNominees:\n“Audition,” La La Land\n“Can��t Stop the Feeling,” Trolls\n“City of Stars,” La La Land\n“The Empty Chair,” Jim: The James Foley Story\n“How Far I’ll Go,” Moana \nHere’s where I’ll get bold, though. The consensus among pundits is that “City of Stars” is the easy choice, and it might be. But it’s not even the best song in La La Land — that would be “Another Day in the Sun,” which wasn’t nominated. And Ryan Gosling’s singing has taken some knocks. So it could go to “Audition” instead… or we could even see those two split the votes, clearing the way for Moana’s pump-up jam, “How Far I’ll Go,” written by Broadway sensation (and occasional freestyle Disney rapper ) Lin-Manuel Miranda.\nWill Win: “How Far I’ll Go”\nDon’t Be Surprised By: “City of Stars”\nDark Horse: “Audition”\nRelated: Lin-Manuel Miranda on His Oscar-Nominated ‘Moana’ Song: ‘You Start by Thinking, Don’t Write “Let It Go”‘ \nBEST VISUAL EFFECTS \nNominees:\nDeepwater Horizon\nDoctor Strange\nKubo and the Two Strings\nThe Jungle Book\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story \nKubo and the Two Strings became the first animated movie to be nominated in the VFX category since Tim Burton’s stop-motion The Nightmare Before Christmas in 1994. Still, it’ll have to settle for that distinction considering it’s in the same category as The Jungle Book , director Jon Favreau’s visually electrifying creature feature that’s so reliant on FX you could argue it’s an animated film, not live-action. Regardless, it’s hard to see it losing here.\nWill Win: The Jungle Book\nDark Horse: Doctor Strange or Rogue One \n\n\nBEST SOUND EDITING & BEST SOUND MIXING \nBest Sound Editing Nominees: \nArrival\nDeepwater Horizon\nHacksaw Ridge\nLa La Land\nSully \nBest Sound Mixing Nominees:\nArrival\nHacksaw Ridge\nLa La Land\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story\n13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi \nFirst, your annual primer: sound editing is the creation of non-musical sound effects used in films (i.e. sirens, gun shots, doors slamming) while sound mixing is the blending of all sounds in a film to find the proper balance. There are two challenges to predicting these: figuring out if voters will favor the musical entry or an action movie; and then deciding if they’ll choose the same winner for each.\nWinners have lined up six of the past 10 years, and three of those four years that they didn’t , it’s because a musical won Sound Mixing, while an action movie won Sound Editing. History, then, favors La La Land in Sound Mixing, and something like Hacksaw Ridge or Arrival in Sound Editing.\nSound Mixing, by the way, is the category where Kevin O’Connell (previously 0-for-20 and now up for Hacksaw Ridge ) or Greg P. Russell (previously 0-for-16, and now up for 13 Hours ) will face off. Sadly, I think their winless streaks continue.\nBest Sound Editing \nWill Win: Hacksaw Ridge\nDon’t Be Surprised By: Arrival \nBest Sound Mixing \nWill Win: La La Land\nDark Horse: Hacksaw Ridge \nBEST LIVE-ACTION SHORT \nNominees: \nEnnemis Intérieurs\nLa Femme et le TGV\nSilent Nights\nSing\nTimecode \nCall this Best Foreign-Language Film, Jr. All five nominees hail from Europe. And four could feasibly win, depending on the mood of voters. Three of those are light: Timecode (a Cannes winner about dancing security guards), Sing (a crowdpleaser about a kids choir not to be confused with the animated feature-length hit), and La Femme et le TGV (a whimsical Swiss comedy about middle-aged baker and a passing train). But my money’s on the more somber entry, Ennemis Intérieurs , a gripping, topical drama about a Muslim French-Algerian man being interrogated while applying for citizenship.\nWill Win: Ennemis Intérieurs\nDon’t Be Surprised By: Timecode\nDark Horse: Sing or La Femme et le TGV \nRelated: A Guide to the Three Short-Film Categories — The Nominees and Ethan Alter’s Picks to Win \nBEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT \nNominees:\nExtremis\n4.1 Miles\nJoe’s Violin\nWatani: My Homeland\nThe White Helmets \nWant a quick bout of depression? Watch all five nominees in this category consecutively. They deal with life amid the devastating warfare in Syria ( Watani, The White Helmets ), refugees risking their lives near a Greek island ( 4.1 Miles ), and the delicacy of working with life support machines ( Extremis ). Only the heartwarming Joe’s Violin — about a Holocaust survivor who donates his instrument to a Bronx schoolgirl — offers some reprieve. They’re all genuinely great and any could win, but I’m partial to the harrowing White Helmets , about civilian teams of first responders risking their lives during bomb attacks in Syria. (The film’s subjects would likely been denied U.S. visas to travel to the Oscars under Trump’s travel ban, but now plan to be in attendance .)\nWill Win: The White Helmets\nDon’t Be Surprised By: Joe’s Violin or Extremis\nDark Horse: 4.1 Miles \nBEST ANIMATED SHORT\n\nNominees:\nBlind Vaysha\nBorrowed Time\nPear Cider and Cigarettes\nPearl\nPiper \nLet’s end on a lighter note though, shall we? There’s no way in heck this Oscar doesn’t go to Pixar’s Piper , which played prior to Finding Dory . It’s a short about a baby sandpiper birdie breaking the waves and overcoming her fear of water. And it’s freaking adorable.\nWill Win: Piper\nDark Horse: Blind Vaysha \nThe 89th Academy Awards will be held Sunday, Feb. 26 at 8:30 p.m. ET/ 5:30 p.m. PT.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:34:42.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
