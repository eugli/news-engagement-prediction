The interview was about something completely different to what Fox News and Horowitz were talking about,\" one of the cops, Anders Göranzon, told Dagens Nyheter . \nTrump suggests Sweden troubled by refugees after Fox News report \nGöranzon and his colleague, Jacob Ekström, told the Swedish newspaper that Horowitz asked them general questions about crime in Sweden. What Horowitz didn't ask, however, was whether they believed the rising crime rates had anything to do with immigration. \n\"It shocked us. He has edited the answers,\" Göranzon charged. \"We were answering completely different questions in the interview. This is bad journalism.\" \nGöranzon claimed Horowitz has eroded his trust in reporters. \n\"It feels like hell,\" the cop said. \"The real questions should be shown along with our answers. We don't own the rights to the film, but the end result is that we don't want to talk to journalists after this. We can't trust each other.\" Ami Horowitz, here with actress Carrie Lazar, at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. (Ken Levine/WireImage for Sundance Film Fest) \nHorowitz didn't immediately return a request for comment from the Daily News. But the New York-based filmmaker did take to Facebook after the story about Trump's rally comments first began to swirl. \n\"I think every media outlet across the globe covering my interview with Tucker Carlson and attacking the President is missing the point,\" he said in a Sunday post . \"Sweden is under assault because of the open door policy to Islamic immigration.\" \nSince the end of World War II, Sweden has become known as one of the world's most immigrant-friendly countries. While some local politicians have raised concerns over accepting too many immigrants too quickly, there have been no Islamic terror attacks in the country since 2010. \nHorowitz' film suggests that migrants in Sweden are to blame for a recent crime surge — though there's no official statistics or studies corroborating that claim. \n\"They oftentimes try to cover up some of these crimes,\" Horowitz told Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Saturday, adding that Swedes are supposedly called racist if they speak out. \nGöranzon ripped Horowitz as \"a madman\" after finding out what he had actually been interviewed for. \n\"We don't stand behind what he says,\" the officer said. \"He is a madman.\" Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:14:23.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
