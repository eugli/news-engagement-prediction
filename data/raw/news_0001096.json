I’m just sick of the silly rules that come out of Europe.” \nDimbleby then asked, jokingly: \"Have the bananas changed?\" \nShe replied: “If you go to Aldi they’re a bit bent.” \nSocial media quickly erupted with comments about the audience member’s comments. \nOne said: “Much respect to Banana woman on #questiontime for not being afraid to sound like the biggest clown this week, despite strong competition.” \n“Jesus Christ. Shape of a banana changed your vote. This is the level of reasoning we are dealing with?” added another, while another said: “Does she realise that she said that out loud and on national television!” \nThe European Parliament Information Office to the UK states that bendy bananas are not banned by the EU. \nIts website states: ”Straight and bendy [bananas] are not banned by the EU. Commission Regulation 2257/94 identifies certain restrictions for fruits that producers have to conform to in order to sell their produce within the EU. \n“The regulation states that bananas must be ‘free from malformation or abnormal curvature’.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:38:56.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
