Supposedly Kailyn really is pregnant , if a source close to her is telling the truth. \nAccording to what the insider tells RadarOnline , Kail is already expecting her third child with the same guy she was allegedly hanging out with soon after she and Javi split. So far, the source doesn't have any other details, and suspiciously enough, Kailyn recently tweeted about learning from her mistakes, as Radar pointed out. I may not have always made the best choices but I will say today I&#39;m happy & my heart is so full ðï¿½ï¿½¤ &mdash; Kail Lowry (@KailLowry) February 21, 2017 \nDefinitely cryptic, but does this mean she's pregnant? We're not sure.

We'd say she definitely has her hands full! \nAnd honestly, whether or not Kail is pregnant, it's totally up to her when she chooses to share it -- although if the rumors are true, a baby bump is going to get harder and harder to hide as time goes on. \nWhatever happens, we can't wait to find out! One thing we can say for sure -- following the lives of our favorite Teen Mom 2 stars is never boring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:53:10.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
