It started with a weird performance of “America The Beautiful” with Gaga standing on the stadium’s roof while stars formed a flag behind her, and then Gaga descended down from the sky and jumped into the typical Halftime Show medley of hits. Also, other than putting on a sparkly jacket thing and grabbing a keytar for “Just Dance,” there weren’t as many ridiculous Gaga outfits as you might expect. At the very least, a dress made out of literal pigskins would’ve been fun for football’s biggest night. \nYou can see video of Gaga’s performance below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:02:06.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
