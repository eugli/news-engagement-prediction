Spike Lee (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 7:24  24 p.m. ET \nKnicks superfan Spike Lee was decked out in a Charles Oakley No. 34 jersey Sunday as he watched from his familiar courtside seat while his favorite team, mired in controversy, earned a 94-90 win over the Spurs at Madison Square Garden. \nIt was a topical display for the famed filmmaker, a lifetime Knicks fan, who said he had the jersey made to show support for Oakley in his back-and-forth with owner James Dolan and expressed disbelief over how the Knicks were treating a former star. \nMORE: 14 worst choke-jobs in NBA playoff history \n\"I mean, how can you say somebody is an alcoholic? You just can't, in my opinion,\" Lee told reporters, via ESPN.com . \"And even if the person was, why would you say that? I don't know why you would say that. All I can do is wear my jersey.\" \nLee was speaking to reporters inside the tunnel where Oakley had been ejected from the Garden and arrested four days earlier following a scuffle with security. \nThe Knicks have engaged in bizarre back-and-forth finger pointing with Oakley since his arrest, releasing a series of statements pleading for Oakley to \"get some help soon\" and painting him as the aggressor. Dolan insinuated Friday that Oakley is an alcoholic. \n\"I'm sure he has problems,\" Dolan, a recovering addict himself, told the New York Post . \"I didn't have the problem he has, but when you're fighting addiction, it's not that much different from anger management or other diseases where you can't control yourself.\" \nOakley has denied these claims and maintained no wrongdoing before being ejected during Wednesday's game. \nDolan banned Oakley from Madison Square Garden definitely. \nThe Knicks' treatment of Oakley caused Lee to question the direction of the franchise. \n\"Who's gonna come here?\" he said, referring to potential free agents. \n\"I'm not mad at any of the Knicks that showed up today,\" Lee said. \"I stood up for everybody, gave them love. Applauded. I stood up for everybody. So I'm happy to see them. Under better conditions, yes. But I'm happy to see them regardless. But it just looks so obvious to me. â€¦I don't know, you got to ask the Garden. I'm just happy to see these guys. I know all of them.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:46:15.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
