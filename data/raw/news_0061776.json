PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Jonathan Toews had three goals and two assists and the Chicago Blackhawks beat rival Minnesota, 5-3, on Tuesday night for their second win over the Western Conference-leading Wild in less than two weeks. \nToews notched his fourth career hat trick on an empty-netter with 1:02 left to stave off a spirited rally by the Wild, who began a franchise-record eight-game homestand on Feb. 8 with a 4-3 overtime loss to the Blackhawks. Toews had a goal and two assists in that one and has 37 points in 35 career games against Minnesota. \nChicago’s captain has been chewing up almost everyone else, too, with 20 points in his last 12 games. Toews’ wing men Nick Schmaltz and Richard Panik had the other goals, giving the Blackhawks 34 goals in their last eight games. Their first line totaled nine points. \nMikael Granlund’s second power-play goal for the Wild brought them within 4-3, before Ryan Suter hit the crossbar with a shot that nearly tied it. \n(© 2017 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
