The city’s parks and environment committee approved a plan Monday to install five paddling nodes that will allow people with nonmotorized recreational watercrafts such as paddleboards, kayaks and canoes to launch into the water.\nThe plan, which costs $500,000, requires council approval. If all goes well, installation would start this summer. According to the preliminary proposal, the nodes will be in five city parks along the waterfront from Scarborough to Etobicoke.\nToronto and Region Conservation Authority will partner with the city for the project, partly to ensure the process doesn’t cause any environmental damage.\nCommittee chair Mary-Margaret McMahon said the idea is to encourage a more paddling and fishing friendly city. Once the installations are complete, she envisions the potential for canoe and kayak sharing programs, just like the city’s popular bike share initiatives.\nArticle Continued Below “Not everyone has a cottage, but we have this glorious lake and beach, and we should be encouraging people to use it more,” she said.\nThe locations were chosen based on their potential to provide both recreational and fishing uses, as well as parking access and community support.\nConstructing the nodes is also about increasing user safety. Right now a number of boating clubs offer service on the lake, but paddlers don’t have designated spots to launch from, which makes the water less accessible, noted McMahon.\nFive nodes are “definitely not enough” to serve the entire city but it’s a good start and a step in the right direction, added the Beaches-East York councillor.\n“It’s an educational tool. A lot of people aren’t even aware there’s a lake down there and that they can swim or paddle in it,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:59:12.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
