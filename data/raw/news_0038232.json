Discernible shift \n“Over just three years there has been a discernible shift in public opinion towards acceptance that climate change is both happening and mainly caused by human activity,” says ComRes chairman Andrew Hawkins. “Seven in ten now believe that almost all, or a majority, of climate scientists believe the same.” \nMarylyn Haines Evans, chairwoman of the public affairs committee of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes, says concerns over flooding, the cost of food, loss of wildlife and impacts on the countryside showed how climate change was becoming all too real for British people. \nJoanna Haigh, co-director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, says: “For people who have worked on climate change for decades, the finding that people recognise the sheer weight of scientific evidence is extremely heartening.” \n“But as the climate system sends increasingly urgent signals of the stress it is coming under, this understanding must be turned into action to address to the problem,” says Haigh. “We have the means to avoid the very worst impacts of climate change, and create a cleaner, healthier society – all it takes is the will.” \nThe findings come after 2016 was declared the hottest year on record globally and the third year in a row when world temperature records were broken. \nMore on these topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:48:48.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
