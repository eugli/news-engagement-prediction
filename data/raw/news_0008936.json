And with US President Donald Trump insisting that IT service providers to hire more US citizens at home, the need to send Indian experts abroad may reduce. \nAt the turn of the century, a boom in the IT sector led by companies such as TCS, Infosys and Wipro translated into the creation of thousands of white collar jobs in the country, and a relatively easy opportunity to work onsite in the mature markets of US and Europe. \nSince these companies were involved in mundane jobs such as infrastructure management, server maintenance and client support, they hired in huge numbers from engineering colleges across the country. Not anymore, perhaps. \nPeter Bendor-Samuel of consulting firm Everest Group estimates that 80% of offshore IT jobs and 30%-40% of finance and accounting jobs in India will be eliminated by robotic process automation, which is the application of technology to process a transaction and carry out other tasks. \n\"Across almost every service, we see the impact as eliminating between 30% and 80% of the full time equivalent working in the Indian services industry. We believe that it will take at least 10 years for the industry to reach the upper bounds of this range, and this adoption will shrink existing legacy book of business 3% or more this year,\" said Bendor-Samuel. According to a recent World Bank report, automation threatens seven out of 10 jobs in India. \nIT biggies are open about the fact that recruitment of the hundreds of graduates from Indian engineering colleges has reduced as they automate. \n\"The focus the industry had on hiring will shift into re-skilling. The entire industry is hiring fewer freshers. Given the macro environment, people are hiring more onsite. Jobs at the bottom of the pyramid are getting automated,\" Wipro HR head Saurabh Govil said. \nAutomation has been changing every sector and putting the squeeze on people, and it's now the turn of IT. \"If you consider the various jobs that any industry has, it is likely that repetitive tasks that can be performed better by systems with artificial intelligence are the jobs that will go away,\" said Richard Lobo, executive vice-president and head of HR at Infosys. Infosys, India's second-largest software services exporter by revenue, hired 5,719 people in the first nine months of this fiscal, down from 17,196 in the same period a year earlier. \n\"We continue our relentless focus on introducing automation across our projects in the backdrop of pricing pressure in traditional services and we expect this to reflect in our future hiring,\" Infosys chief executive Vishal Sikka said in a recent conference call with analysts.
