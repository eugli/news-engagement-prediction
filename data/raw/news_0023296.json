That’s the sense I’m getting,” Powers added, “and I’m not sure where she’s getting that idea, because that’s not something that I’ve ever heard before.” \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:11:06.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
