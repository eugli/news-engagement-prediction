Trump signed legislation (House Joint Resolution 38) to stop the costly “Stream Protection Rule” from further harming coal workers and the communities that depend on them. H.J. Res. 38 blocks an overly burdensome regulation from harming the coal industry. The regulation was expected to reduce coal production, leading to fewer coal jobs across the country. The blocked regulation threatened the coal industry with millions of dollars in compliance costs. Complying with the regulation would have put an unsustainable financial burden on small mines, most of which are in the Appalachian Basin. The blocked regulation would have duplicated existing regulations already in place to protect Americans. \nGIVING COAL COUNTRY RELIEF: Since 2009, the coal industry has declined, leaving workers and communities without a lifeline. Since January 2009, the coal mining industry has lost over 36,000 jobs without any relief in sight. From 2009 to 2015, coal production declined by over 177,000,000 tons across the country. From 2009 to 2015, over 600 coal mines closed. \nA PROMISE TO COAL WORKERS: Before President Trump’s inauguration, he promised coal workers he would support them and reverse the harmful actions of the past administration. November 21, 2016, the Trump-Pence Transition Team pledged to “end the war on coal” and review harmful regulations created under the Obama Administration. September 22, 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump called out harmful coal regulations: “I will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.” August 8, 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump pledged to the American people: “We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work.” \nGETTING GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY: President Trump has been steadfast in his commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on all Americans, their pocketbooks, and their businesses. President Trump has required that for every new Federal regulation, two existing regulations be eliminated. President Trump has placed a moratorium on all new regulations by executive departments and agencies that are not compelled by Congress or public safety. President Trump directed the Commerce Department to streamline Federal permitting processes for domestic manufacturing and to reduce regulatory burdens on domestic manufacturers. President Trump signed an Executive Order expediting the environmental review and approval processes for domestic infrastructure projects. President Trump signed legislation to eliminate a costly regulation that threatened to put domestic extraction companies and their employees at an unfair disadvantage. President Trump directed the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a full review of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to ensure associated, burdensome regulations receive proper scrutiny. President Trump ordered re-examination of the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule, to make certain that it does not harm Americans as they save for retirement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:13:56.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
