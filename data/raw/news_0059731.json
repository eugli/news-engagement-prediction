Pinnick \nPinnick said CAF needs a “new generation” of leadership, following the change at the top of the world governing body Fifa. \nHe cited “post election differences between Gianni [Infantino, the new Fifa president] and Issa Hayatou which are irreconcilable”. \nInfantino will be in Johannesburg later on Tuesday for a gathering of football federation leaders from across the continent. \nHe is then due to visit Zimbabwe at the invitation of the head of the southern African confederation, Cosafa – which also backs Ahmad. \nPinnick acknowledged that Hayatou could still win – but said if he did, the veteran Cameroonian would need to be open to different influences. \n“You have to listen to a larger audience instead of just a tiny cabal, you have to know it goes beyond you,” Pinnick said. \n“I will definitely work with him if he wins but my prayer is we need a bridge builder and that person is Ahmad.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:42:33.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
