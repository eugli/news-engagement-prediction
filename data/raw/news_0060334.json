Trump’s relationship with CPAC has been complicated. Last year, he made a last-minute decision not to speak at the conference and instead remained on the campaign trail. Several CPAC speakers went on to criticize the then-candidate in their speeches. But Trump’s reception this year is likely be different. CPAC’s 2017 conference features Trump aids and Cabinet secretaries including Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, and Betsy DeVos. And as Vox’s Jeff Stein wrote , CPAC organizers have been wary of criticizing Trump this time around: The question to watch at CPAC will be how much space between Trump and American conservatism remains. In an op-ed published on Monday , Matt Schlapp, president of the American Conservative Union, which is responsible for putting on CPAC, ducked the question altogether beyond noting “there are questions” because Trump “did not run as a longtime champion of conservative causes.” Those interested in watching Trump’s speech can tune in at C-Span.org , as well as on most cable TV news channels.
