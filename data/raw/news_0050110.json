While the documents don’t specifically mention the Desire 650, a quick Google search of these two model numbers brings up results for the Desire 650 which is what suggests this may be the phone in question. HTC’s Desire 650 has already launched outside of the U.S., and it’s been rumored to launch on Cricket Wireless in the near future. The device has even leaked a couple of times in the past few weeks so all signs point to the device getting a U.S. release sometime soon. \nThe two most recent leaks for the HTC Desire 650 happened last week on February 16th. The first, showcased a press render of the phone, while the second was a series of leaked images of the Cricket Wireless version sent in by an anonymous tipster , who claims to be an HTC beta tester for the device. Considering the leaks of the device in the press render and the fact that the device seems to be in testing already, having the phone pass through the FCC shouldn’t be too shocking if it’s nearing a release onto Cricket’s network. \nWhile this doesn’t confirm that the phone in the document filings is the HTC Desire 650, it’s worth noting that the FCC documents list of the network frequencies and LTE bands that are supported by this device, and it’s listed as supporting LTE bands 2, 4, 5, and 12, all of which are LTE bands that AT&T uses. Since Cricket Wireless is owned by AT&T their network works off of these frequencies as well, so the supported LTE bands match up. There doesn’t appear to be any more useful information in the documents, such as diagrams of the device, so all there is to go off of is the model numbers and the reference that these are smartphones as well as the network frequency support. That being said, there are two model numbers so this suggests that there will be one phone model going to Cricket while the other could be meant for another carrier though there is no detail as to which carrier.
