Michael Erving Seattle startup Utrip raised $4 million and added a former Expedia executive as a board director to make travel planning easier. The average traveler visits 38 websites before booking a vacation, an Expedia study found in 2013. Utrip’s machine learning platform aims to give travelers a personalized itinerary in one place. Gilad Berenstein is founder and CEO of Utrip. Michael Erving “We think it’s crazy travelers have to go to 38 sources,” Utrip founder and CEO Gilad Berenstein said. “We want to help them centralize all of it into one personalized platform to manage the entire trip experience.” Instead of searching separate websites to find out the best activities and destinations, Utrip uses a traveler’s preferences to develop a personalized, day-by-day itinerary based on recommendations from experts including Seattle’s best-known chef Tom Douglas . The 18-employee company offers the platform to consumers and a white-label version to companies, including Starwood Hotels & Resorts, Jet Blue and Holland America, Pike Place Market, the Space Needle and Ride the Ducks. Founded in 2012, Utrip has attracted several investors including Plug and Play, Tiempo Capital, and Acorn Ventures, as well as angel investors Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti , Seattle Hospitality Group founder and CEO H. S. Wright III , Apple executive Gary Wipfler and others. The funding will help Utrip build out machine learning capabilities, automate marketing for clients and invest for the first time in sales and marketing. The company has raised at least $5.6 million to date. Utrip recently brought on Michael Adler , former Expedia chief financial officer, to join the company’s board. Adler knows how big companies think about data and will help Utrip effectively use a database of 2 million travelers, Berenstein said. Chris Manderino this month became the company’s chief operating officer. She’s a former executive of Dwellable, a Seattle vacation rental startup acquired in 2015 by HomeAway. HomeAway is now owned by Expedia. Utrip won the Puget Sound Business Journal’s TechFlash Cup in 2014 . Oren Etzioni, founder of both Decide.com and CEO of the Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence, was one of Utrip's early advisors.
