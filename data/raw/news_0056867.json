This is seen as a precursor to a buyback, because the current Articles of Association of the company doesn't have a provision for a buyback written into it. \n\nPeople ET NOW spoke to further said that the promoter group, led by NR Narayana Murthy will not oppose a share buyback when it is announced by the board. The founders currently hold nearly 13% in the company and are still classified as promoters. \n\nThe size of the buyback is likely to be over $2.5 billion and will be announced in April, once the results of the postal ballot is released. \n\nThis will be the first buyback in the company's history and comes day after similar moves by its rivals Cognizant and TCS, as pressure mounts on IT companies to return cash to shareholders in an increasingly difficult demand environment. \n\nInfosys CEO Vishal Sikka , said in a recent conference call with analysts that the company looks at capital allocation constantly and that no options are off the table. \n\nInfosys founder NR Narayana Murthy recently raised governance concerns at the company he founded over three decades back on a number of issues- unusually high severance pay for its former CFO Rajiv Bansal and high compensation for its CEO Vishal Sikka.
