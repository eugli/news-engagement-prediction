Sian, of Berinsfield said: \"All of a sudden he took off his jacket and said 'It's OK - I'm a doctor. Sian Berry and her daughter Mia Gilbert with Dr Ioannis Spiliotis, Doga Tasli (who also helped) and Sian's mum Christine (Photo: Oxford Mail/SWNS.com) \n“He flashed his badge at my mum then starting helping out.\" \nDr Spiliotis, who works at the John Radcliffe Hospital , helped out and less than 20 minutes later, little Mia was born weighing 9lbs 0.5oz. \nHe said: \"When I arrived I saw this poor lady in the passenger seat and I could see the baby's head. Sian Berry and her daughter Mia Gilbert with Dr Ioannis Spiliotis, Doga Tasli (who also helped) and Sian's mum Christine (Photo: Oxford Mail/SWNS.com) \n“I wanted to get her to hospital but everything was happening so quickly I said 'right, we'll do it here'.\" \nAn ambulance arrived but the paramedics handed gloves and towels to Dr Spiliotis. The whole thing was over in 20 minutes and baby Mia arrived healthily on Monday. \nThe family have since been taken home and the tot met her saviours earlier this week - Dr Spiliotis and passerby Doga Tasli, who held Sian's hand throughout.
