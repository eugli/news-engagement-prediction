The actor, however, feels that their repartee would be entertaining for the audience. “I am quite excited to work with Karan and I know I will enjoy a lot. We have done rehearsals and they have come out really well. I have worked with him earlier on Kapil’s show, so, I know that his timing is superb. That you have to give to him. He is brilliant, and our timings match. When you are doing comedy, you need to get the right reaction from your partner. That’s what I get from Karan. Our pairing is going to be very interesting to watch.” \nAlso read| Keith Sequeira, Rochelle Rao not part of Nach Baliye 8.
