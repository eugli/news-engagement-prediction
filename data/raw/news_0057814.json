Second from right (front row) is Rijnberg. \nAT SIX-months-old, Muhammad Hazim Mohd Hafiz’s parents found out through doctors that he had Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). \nThe five-year-old from Sungai Petani, Kedah is unable to crawl, stand nor move on his own. \nOn a daily basis, he needs to be on a BiPAP machine to support his breathing. \nTo ease breathing and clear secretions from lungs, those with SMA need a Cough Assist Machine, which also helps to reduce the chances of contracting infections. \nHazim is just one of 30 in the community of people under the We Care Journey organisation who will benefit from a donation of five Cough Assist Machines by the Latin Ladies Association of Malaysia. \nThey were given a cheque for RM120,000 for the machines raised through generous donations by more than 10 companies, Latin American Embassies and the Embassy of Spain in Malaysia. \nFunds were raised during LLAM’s 9th Latin Charity Ball “Fiesta Mariachi” held last November. \nIn total, RM152,100 was raised at the ball from auctions of products brought directly from 11 countries to the event such as art pieces and raffles. \nA sum of RM32,000 from the amount was donated to Taman Megah’s Handicapped and Disabled Children’s Home, for purchase of televisions and a washing machine. \nThe Latin Ladies Association of Malaysia president Alicia Rijnberg said LLAM has been around for more than 40 years. \n“Every year we choose different organisations to give aid to. \n“There are times when those we have helped need more assistance and we will help where we can,”she said. \nAside from the ball, she said the association organises many events throughout the year to raise funds as well as do volunteer work. \nMonthly, they would organise events such as tennis tournaments, cooking classes and zumba to raise funds. \nAt the end of 2016, they raised a total of RM290,000 in donations for different causes that range from education to healthcare areas. \nThe association will organise more events to help organisations in need as a way to give back to Malaysians for its warm hospitality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:52:13.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
