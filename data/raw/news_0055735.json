That's how I view it,” Maher said on a March 1998 episode of his ABC talk show “Politically Incorrect” that has gone viral since his interview with Yiannopoulos. “Basically, they're having a family and they're keeping the mother in jail because she won't conform to what society feels should be the perfect American family.” \nLetourneau began a relationship with Vili Fualaau in 1996 when she taught his sixth grade class at Shorewood Elementary School. \nShe was arrested in March 1997, at which point she was already pregnant with the couple’s first child, a daughter named Audrey who would be born that May. \nLetourneau pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree child rape and was sentenced to six months in jail — three months were suspended — and three years of treatment as a sexual offender. She also agreed to never have contact with Fualaau again. \nIn February 1998, two weeks after she was released from jail, Letourneau was arrested again after being found having sex with Fualaau in her car. Bill Maher, who has taken credit for the downfall of Milo Yiannopoulos, previously defended statutory rape. (Janet Van Ham/AP) \nShe was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for violating her probation. \nTheir second daughter, Georgia, was born in October of that year. \nLetourneau was released from prison in 2004 and married Fualaau, then 21, in May 2005. \nMaher defended the relationship again in a 2007 Playboy interview. \n“I think it’s a little offbeat, but you know, I believe in the double standard. If a 28-year-old male teacher is s---wing a 13-year-old girl, that’s a crime. But with Debra Lafave s---wing her 14-year-old boy student, the crime is that we didn’t get it on videotape,” he told the magazine . \n“Was he being taken advantage of? I wish I had been taken advantage of like that. What a memory she gave him! I would think he’s a champion among his friends.” In 1998, Maher defended Mary Kay Letourneau, a 34-year-old schoolteacher who had a sexual relationship with her 12-year-old student, saying she was imprisoned because “she won't conform to what society feels should be the perfect American family.” (ALAN BERNER/AP) \nHe also said that Letourneau deserved to be fired, but not imprisoned because it “was true love.” \nThe articles resurfaced after Maher took credit for Yiannopoulos’ downfall after appearing on his “Real Time” show on Friday. \nYiannopoulos resigned from Breitbart, was dropped as a speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference and had his book deal canceled by Simon & Schuster after remarks that appeared to support pedophilia. \n“As I say, sunlight is the best disinfectant,” Maher told The New York Times . “You’re welcome.” \nHis reps did not return a request for comment.
