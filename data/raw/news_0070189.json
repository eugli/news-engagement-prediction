The Montreal International Fireworks Competition is an annual favorite, a summer staple in the city every July. Photo by Flickr user TMAB2003 Updated January 03, 2017 . \nThe largest pyrotechnics competition of its kind in the world, the Montreal International Fireworks Competition has been going strong since 1985 and remains one of this city's top summer attractions . In 2017, the Montreal Fireworks Competition is held in July 2017. Exact dates will be confirmed as we close in on July. Watch for Free \nWhere's the best place to see Montreal fireworks come International Fireworks Competition time? No one will argue that buying a ticket to see them up close and personal at La Ronde is a sure bet but you can get a great view just the same without paying a penny. And it seems like every local has his or her favorite secret spot. \ncontinue reading below our video Tipping Etiquette Around the World But not everyone has access to a strategically located private highrise balcony or rooftop. Regardless, there are so many possible vantage points in the city, like these 8 amazing spots , all guaranteed to give you a spectacular view of one of the most impressive pyrotechnic competitions in the world. \nPay to See \nSplurge a little and see them synchronized to music, up close with the judges at La Ronde , just in front of the Lac des Dauphins . It's a nice treat and more impressive than viewing them for free from a distance, albeit pricey for a 30-minute show. So plan for a day trip: all fireworks tickets, varying from roughly $52 to $70 plus taxes, grant a full day's admission to all of La Ronde's rides and roller coasters. Parking at La Ronde on the day/eve of fireworks will set you back roughly $25. \nSame Time, Rain or Shine \nAll shows are scheduled at 10 p.m. Motorists should be aware that for all presentations, the Jacques-Cartier Bridge closes at 8 p.m. , only reopening at the end of each show. \nVisuals \nFor a reminder of how spectacular the shows are, check out this Montreal fireworks photo gallery .
