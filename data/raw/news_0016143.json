Everyone gets into the whole two-star, three-star, four-star, five-star thing. The only five-star that we even concern ourselves with is a five-star heart. \n“We want five-star hearts and five-star competitors.” \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

We’ll be more competitive than we’ve ever been. \n“We’ve had the best offseason so far that we’ve had since we’ve been here.” \nJones and Tennessee director of player personnel Bob Welton said they evaluate a player’s competitive spirit throughout the recruiting process, and not just on the football field, basketball court or baseball diamond. \nThe Vols entertain recruits with games throughout their weekends in Knoxville. They play games on campus, go bowling downtown and play ping pong, billiards, corn hole and even charades during trips to Jones’ house. \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .) \nWelton said Tennessee isn’t just entertaining the players in those situations. He said they’re also evaluating them. \n“It could be something as a simple as a corn hole game, but our guys are competing, talking trash,” Welton said. “We watch that. We observe that. We’ve actually shied away from some kids on visits when all these kids are out there competing, and that kid’s over there just sitting. That tells you a lot about a kid. \n“That competitiveness, you can’t coach it, and you usually can’t change it once you get ‘em. You can’t put that into a kid. They have to be born with it and live with it.” \nJones said he also loves watching players compete against each other, and that he gains “invaluable” insight from those situations. \n“We’re evaluating their competitive makeup — you know, do they want to compete with everything that you do,” Jones said. “We always talk about in our football program, ‘Don’t compare, just compete.’” \n\nContact Wes Rucker by email at wesrucker247@gmail.com or ON TWITTER , or FOLLOW GOVOLS247 ON FACEBOOK .
