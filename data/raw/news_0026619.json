(Something his colleague Jim Acosta would also remark on .) \nAfter anchor Wolf Blitzer highlighted that the two American outlets Trump called on today were Townhall.com and CBN, continuing a trend from previous joint pressers, King went off. \nReferencing the reports surrounding former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and the Trump campaign’s contact with Russian intelligence officials, King said the following: \nWell, it would be nice, it would be nice, if the conservative outlets the president is calling on would ask him tough questions, and instead of curry favor with the president, they might do him a favor by letting him answer these questions because until he does, this story is not going to go away. \nKing then hit Trump and the White House for giving different descriptions about Flynn’s departure, as it was stated yesterday that Trump had asked for Flynn’s resignation over an erosion of trust but at today’s presser he blamed the media for its unfair attacks on Flynn while calling him a good man. \n“Then the President of the United States just told the American people and the world something different,” he exclaimed. “Unfair media attacks on his National Security Adviser led this man to unfairly be run out of the White House. Well, who is telling the truth?” \nWatch the clip above, via CNN. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T21:09:36.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
