( Never dreamt of taking six-wicket haul, says Yuzvendra Chahal ) \nChasing 203 for victory, a spectacular batting collapse by England saw it bowled out in 16.3 overs - with the last eight wickets falling for just eight runs and six players failing to score. ( Yuzvendra Chahal second bowler after Ajantha Mendis to take six-wicket haul in T20 Internationals \nChahal became the first Indian bowler to take a five-wicket haul in T20Is, and he also took the third-best figures in the shortest format. Only Sri Lanka's Ajantha Mendis has achieved a six-wicket haul before him, twice, with figures of 6-8 against Zimbabwe (2012) and 6-16 against Australia (2011). ( Bengaluru T20I: Chahal's record haul of 6/25 sets up India's third successive series win over England ) \nFormer India captain Sourav Ganguly credited the Indian Premier League for the rise of Chahal. The 26-year-old Chahal plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL. \n\"Chahal is also a Royal Challengers Bangalore bowler. So, he knows this surface as much as anybody else does. T20 cricket has been a product of the IPL and Chahal has been a product of the IPL. He has got better and better by bowling in the IPL. He knows exactly what to do. It's a terrific effort. IPL has had great effects on India's T20 side and you have seen a lot of players come out of that format and do well for India,\" Ganguly to India Today. \n'INDIA WERE OUTSTANDING' \n\"India were outstanding tonight. After that over of Jasprit Bumrah in Nagpur in the previous game, they were a different side. They just smashed England out. When you get 202 run on the board, very seldom you lose cricket matches. England were not good and they haven't been good for a long, long while except 2012.\" \n'HOPE DHONI KEEPS COMING AT NO.4' \nIn this format, hope Dhoni floating up and not down. That's what is important for India and give him time. Even in overseas conditions, give him 10-11 overs so that he sets in. And that's how he can be dangerous. If you keep giving him 10-11 deliveries, he can't do that. So, it's a great decision by Virat Kohli and I hope he keeps him at No.4 For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:23:50.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
