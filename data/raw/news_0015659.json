messages safe \nThe option must be turned on manually from the app's settings Friday 10 February 2017 11:31 GMT Click to followThe Independent Tech Logo of WhatsApp seen on a smartphone February 20, 2014 in New York STAN HONDA/AFP/Getty Images \nWhatsApp has finally added two-factor authentication to its app, letting people make sure their messages are kept safe. \nThe change helps keep people from breaking into your WhatsApp account and reading your messages, even if they have a password. But it must be turned on manually and requires the latest version of the app. \nTwo-factor authentication, often shortened to 2FA, allows people to keep their accounts more secure than just with a password. It also ties that same account to something else – like an email address or phone number – that anyone looking to get into the account needs to have access to as well.

GAME Digital \nThe app has been testing out the feature in beta versions of the app for both iOS and Android. But it's now available to everyone. \nTo get the feature, a phone needs to have the latest version of the app. That's done as usual, by updating through the App Store – and has probably already happened for most people, automatically. WhatsApp will soon let you track your friends in real-time \nOnce that's done, the setting is enabled by heading to the Settings menu and clicking on \"account\" and then \"two-step verification\". From there all you have to do is press the \"enable\" button. \nAs well as tying your account to your phone number, it can also be attached to an email address. That's entered at the same time and gives you an extra way of getting back into your WhatsApp if you can't get to your number – if you lose your phone, for instance. \nThe company notes that it's important to be vigilant about those emails, once they're turned on. People might attempt to send out messages tricking people into deactivating two-factor verification – and unless you request such an email, it's important never to click on it.
