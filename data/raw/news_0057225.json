The \"Homer at the Bat\" episode of \"The Simpsons\" aired 25 years ago. (Courtesy of Fox) \nUpdated at 3:21 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 3:21 p.m. ET \nKen Griffey Jr. already has a place in Cooperstown, but now his grotesquely swollen jaw will get its own recognition in baseball's hallowed halls. \nYes, \"The Simpsons\" is headed to the Baseball Hall of Fame. \nThe Associated Press reports that baseball's ultimate shrine will pay homage to the long-running Fox animated series May 27 when it celebrates the 25th anniversary of the classic episode \"Homer at the Bat,\" in which a number of MLB stars of the day, including future Hall of Famers Wade Boggs, Ozzie Smith and Ken Griffey Jr., served as ringers for the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant softball team. \nMORE: SN ranks the Springfield softball ringers \nThe episode aired on Feb. 20, 1992, and also featured the voices of Jose Canseco, Roger Clemens, Don Mattingly, Steve Sax, Mike Scioscia and Darryl Strawberry. Much of the episode's humor stemmed from the unusual fates suffered by many of the ringers, including Griffey's development of gigantism caused by his overzealous consumption of nerve tonic. \nBut perhaps the most enduring aspect of \"Homer at the Bat\" is Terry Cashman's \"Talkin' Softball,\" a parody of his own classic song \"Talkin' Baseball,\" which played over the end credits. Take it away, Terry. \nAs part of the event in May, Boggs and Smith are scheduled to appear at a planned round-table discussion with episode executive producers Al Jean and Mike Reiss, director Jim Reardon, executive story editor Jeff Martin and casting director Bonnie Pietila, the AP reports. \nOne can only assume that Boggs' opinion of Pitt the Elder hasn't changed.
