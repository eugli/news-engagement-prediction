The Pelicans are still trying to work Cousins into the system and come into Sunday’s game against the Thunder still looking for their first win since the deal while the Kings have gone 1-1 since the move. \nDespite the criticism, Kings general manager Vlade Divac has stood behind the deal. In a recent Q&A with the Sacramento Bee , Divac took full responsibility for the deal and added he would “step down” in two years if the deal did not work out. \n“That’s my job, and I take responsibility. And I totally understand why some fans would be upset. They supported DeMarcus, and I like DeMarcus a lot. But I believe we are going to be in a better position in two years. I want to hear again from these same people in two years. If I’m right, great. If I’m wrong, I’ll step down. But if I go down, I’m going down my way.” \nThe real question is if Kings owner Vivek Ranadive, who reportedly was quite fond of Hield’s game before the deal, will give Divac two years to reconstruct a franchise that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:49:51.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
