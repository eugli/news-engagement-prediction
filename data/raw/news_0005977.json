PUBLISHED: 17:02, Fri,   17:14, Fri, Feb 3, 2017 BRITISH TRANSPORT POLICE/ GOOGLE STREET VIEW Salah Koubar, 20, has been jailed for seven years for rape \nSalah Koubar, 20, threw the South Korean woman over the railings at West Dulwich Station and dragged her into the bushes to carry out his attack. \nA passer-by later found the woman running along the platform wearing only a T-shirt and knickers in the early hours of the morning. \nThe court heard the victim had hoped to meet a friend on her last night in London before travelling home to South Korea. \nKoubar met the woman at Freedom Bar in Soho, and promised to take her to another venue called VIP in Westminster.

At some point you decided that you were going to have sex with her Recorder Timothy Greene \nWhen Koubar realised the witness was about to call the police he jumped on a train seconds before the doors closed. \nKoubar, who came to the UK via France and was granted asylum in this country, was arrested two days after the attack on July 26. \nJailing Koubar for seven years, the judge Mr Recorder Timothy Greene said: “It was terrifying for her to be in a strange city not speaking the language. \n“You repeatedly lied to her and told her she could trust you. At some point you decided that you were going to have sex with her. \n“Initially your attitude did not seem to be controlling or sinister. \n“But then your behaviour became chilling. You took her phone off her, and then you took her bag. \n“It was clear from the witness box of the effects your crime had on the victim. You took away her sense of security. Her self-image has been battered.” GETTY STOCK IMAGE A passenger catching an early train heard the woman's screams \nKoubar showed no emotion as he was led to the cells. \nHe claimed he had paid the woman £200 for sex, but no intimacy had taken place. \nKoubar of Densole Close, Beckenham, Kent, later claimed he then snatched her bag to try and get his money back. \nHe also said that the victim had ripped her clothes herself. \nIn an impact statement, the woman said she feared Koubar would kill her during the attack and no longer goes out after dark following the attack. \nShe said: “I trusted him. I had no romantic intention with him at all. \n“He betrayed my trust. I was really scared when he was doing what he was doing. \n“I thought he might kill me because of his action and power. \n“If a member of the public had not come to help me he could have done more.” GOOGLE STREET VIEW Koubar attacked the woman at West Dulwich train station \nThe woman had to delay her return trip to Korea for two weeks following the attack. \nShe added: “I was wearing a short dress and thought I was looking attractive and pretty. \n“After the attack I felt it was my fault as I was wearing a short dress. \n“I do not feel pretty anymore. \n“I now buy long skirts and dresses.” \nThe victim said she believes Korea is a safer country but still cannot bring herself to go out after dark. \nAfter the sentence DI Ian Trantum said: “As the judge described it, the events were chilling. The young victim came back from South Korea for the case and she was unbelievably brave to do so. \n“She's a remarkable young lady, as was a Good Samaritan who helped her. I pay tribute to him for the actions he took in the early hours that morning.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T19:29:44.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
