Now that the Ford Mustang is on sale in Europe, we wanted to create something that symbolised its car culture legacy and European debut,\" says Anthony Ireson, Ford’s European Director of Marketing Communications. \nFord worked with Mashable for the video’s exclusive debut.

FILMING We wanted to create something that symbolised the Ford Mustang's culture legacy and European debut. \nRe-creating the 1976 film was quite an ambitious endeavor, as the modern cobblestone streets of Paris present more challenging conditions for filming. Some of the roads featured in the original film are now one-ways; others have been pedestrianised or no longer exist. There was also quite a lot of red tape surrounding permitting. \nAnother challenge for the filmmakers was re-creating the sense of exhilaration of the original film; today’s critics and moviegoers are accustomed to CGI explosions at every turn, and they’re less easily impressed than the audiences of the ‘70s. \nBut the filmmakers persisted. They were adamant that the re-make was to be as close as possible to the 1976 version. By making the video a bit shorter than the eight-minute original, they were able to preserve all of its thrills, regardless of adjustments to route. \nUltimately, the video successfully replicates the cinematic tenor of the original film with finesse. \n\"We pulled in some of the best talent in motorsport rigging to keep the camera steady on the cobbled Paris streets,\" says Ireson. \nPart of the original film’s appeal, Ireson explains, is its raw, unpolished aesthetic: \"It’s just pure, true and cool.\" \nThis was something the filmmakers took great pains to replicate in ReRendezvous , seamlessly blending modern filming techniques with the classic look and feel of the original work. \nFilming in 360 allowed for a few upgrades to the viewing experience, too. For one, viewers can actually see inside the car, which adds a new level of immersion. It’s also a visceral, immediate medium that’s well suited for the concept. Claude LeLouch, the director of the original film, gave his blessing for the re-make: \" C’etait un rendez-vous was a first in 1976; nobody had ever filmed an urban drive like it. So I was thrilled by the prospect of recreating this high-octane short using the very latest technology, making it even more immersive,\" LeLouch told Ford. \nThe end result is a mixture of two genuine icons that’s sure to become an instant classic. \n\"We want people to feel the excitement of driving a Ford Mustang, but made even more special by experiencing it in such a stunning environment,\" says Ireson. \"Everyone is used to track car shots — but Paris at dawn is special.\" \n*Disclaimer: Ford adhered to the rules of the road and did not break any speed limits when shooting this film \nWatch the film via the FordVR app available in Google Play and iTunes .
