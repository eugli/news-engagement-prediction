Article continues below \nHowever, it is not known what is wrong with Shamsuddin, and many are speculating that he has cracked under the pressure of the situation, rather than actually being ill. \nHis decision was accepted by match referee Andy Pycroft, who has avoided putting the umpire in a tough situation. Article continues below \nAs of writing this article, England are aiming for their first series win in 32 years on their tour of India, and the final T20 game is being played as of writing. \nThe hosts hit 202 runs off 20 overs, with England currently on 16 runs after two. \nShamshuddin's decision to remove himself from the game will please the touring team, who did not want an umpire at the centre of attention who was under pressure to get every decision spot on. \nThe umpire also ensured that the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) could not axe him themselves by stepping aside for the final game. \nEngland batsman Joe Root revealed that he had some sympathy for the official, who made a number of poor calls in Nagpur. \nShamshuddin was thrown straight into umpire the match less than 24 hours after landing in India, travelling all the way from Australia. Therefore, he would have been heavily jetlagged, which may have contributed to his poor officiating. \nHowever, Root also called for a decision review system to be used in T20 matches following Sunday's game, but it is not being used in the series decider in Bangalore today. \nEngland will be hoping that Shamsuddin's decisions will not decide the outcome of the entire series, as they look to finally get one over on India in their own backyard after three decades of disappointment. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
