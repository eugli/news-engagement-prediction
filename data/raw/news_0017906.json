In January, a woman from Mumbai had won SC's nod to medically terminate her foetus that had severe brain anomaly. \n\nIndian laws allow abortion till 20 weeks of pregnancy, but around half dozen cases have, in the recent past, moved the SC seeking permission to abort beyond this deadline. \n\nIn this case, a bench of justices S A Bobde and L Nageswara Rao accepted the plea of the lady after a medical board constituted by it also favoured abortion. The board in its report to SC said that life of the lady would be endangered if abortion is not allowed. It also said that there is no chance of survival of foetus. \n\nAccepting the report, the bench allowed lady to abort her foetus. \n\nIn the second week of January, a Dombivli woman, who was 23 weeks into her pregnancy, moved SC as she wanted to abort her foetus which had anencephaly, a serious defect in which parts of the brain or skull are not adequately developed. \n\nThe court had asked a medical board from KEM Hospital to give an opinion. The woman underwent abortion at the same hospital a week later on SC directions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:02:25.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
