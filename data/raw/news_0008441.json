(Photo by Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images) \nAmazingly, there is a show on network television called \"The Wall\" that is not about President Trump, yet viewers who tune in to NBC during the program's 8 p.m. time slot Tuesday will nevertheless see a production starring the commander in chief. \nThat's because Trump is breaking into prime time to reveal his Supreme Court nominee in the most Trumpian way possible — on live TV, with the biggest audience he can muster. Get ready for Wednesday's tweet about the ratings. \nNBC, CBS, ABC and Fox all confirmed to The Fix that they will carry Trump's selection show live, in place of their regularly scheduled programs . That means bumping \"The Middle\" on ABC, \"New Girl\" on Fox and a special about Super Bowl commercials on CBS. \nThe networks seemed reluctant to surrender prime-time air to the president. Three of the four were unable to say Monday whether they would do so, when I asked shortly after Trump tweeted his plan; they said Tuesday that they would, in fact, broadcast Trump's remarks. I have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court. It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M. (W.H.) \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 \nNetworks hate presidential prime-time addresses for one, obvious reason: money. The events can cost millions of dollars in lost advertising revenue. \nWith a former reality TV star now in the Oval Office, broadcasters could be forced to choose between taking more losses than they have in the past and rejecting White House requests for airtime. Speaking in prime time on just his 12th day in office, Trump is already ahead of the pace of Barack Obama, whose own, frequent addresses at the outset of his presidency irked the networks. \nThree weeks after he was sworn in, Obama held a prime-time news conference that all four major broadcasters carried live. A few weeks later, he spoke in prime time to a joint session of Congress. As is traditional, the White House did not call the early-term speech a State of the Union address, but that's basically what it was. Trump will do the same thing Feb. 28. \nObama convened a second prime-time news conference March 24, 2009. Then he called another April 29. The third time, Fox refused to interrupt its regular programming. The four major networks reported that the three Obama news conferences cost them a combined $30 million in advertising losses. \nReuters described the networks' difficult position in a story May 10, 2009: \nNow top network executives quietly are hoping that Fox's decision not to air Obama's April 29 news conference will serve as precedent for denying future White House requests for prime airtime. \n\"We will continue to make our decisions on White House requests on a case-by-case basis, but the Fox decision gives us cover to reject a request if we feel that there is no urgent breaking news that is going to be discussed,\" said one network executive, who, like all, would not go on the record fearing repercussions from the Obama administration. \nAnother network executive confided, \"Nobody wants to take on the White House, so we'll have to tiptoe through this.\" \nThe networks ultimately did grow bolder. Fox declined to air another Obama news conference in September 2009. All four denied the White House's request for a prime-time slot in 2014, when Obama wanted to speak to the nation about immigration. \nBut as the Reuters report made clear, saying no to the White House is not easy. If TV executives were \"fearing repercussions\" in 2009, imagine how they are feeling now that the president is a man who views the media as the \"opposition party.\" \nThe frequency with which Trump demands prime-time air — and the way the networks respond — will be worth monitoring. politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:13:57.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
