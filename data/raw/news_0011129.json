Not for fighting on the sport’s biggest stage for the first time, not for fighting the much bigger Anthony Hamilton . Even when he suffered a gruesome laceration above his right eye due to a clash of heads, the jiu jitsu black belt stayed calm and let his hands fly. Hamilton tried coming inside with a combo of punches, but he walk right into a perfectly-timed overhand right to the forehead, dropping “Freight Train” face first onto the canvas. Referee Herb Dean had no choice but to intervene, allowing Fortuna to walk off with not only his first UFC win, but also the first knockout of his MMA career. The official time of the TKO came at the 3:10 mark of round one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:46:13.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
