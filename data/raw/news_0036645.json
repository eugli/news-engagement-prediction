However, now that the exam season is almost here and very few days are left for revision, I’ll give you a few quick tips for that final thrust to your preparation plans. \nFollow these simple yet effective tips. \nTip #1 \nFrom the NCERT book, practice each and every worked-out example, graph and diagram, especially- \na) Ray diagram for Astronomical Telescope, Compound Microscope and Reflecting Telescope. \nb) Diagrams for few devices like cyclotron and potentiometer to name a few. \nTip#2 \nMemorise definitions and laws, especially Gauss’s Law, Ampere’s circuital law, Lenz’s law, self-inductance, mutual inductance, definition of one henry, wattless current, power factor and quality factor. \nTip#3 \nMake a separate list of all formulae along with what each variable represents and derivations. \nTip#4 \nSolve question papers. Nothing beats practice. For self-evaluation, write at least five full syllabus tests timed exactly like the Boards and try to complete them in 2 ½ hours instead of three hours. \nThe following points are to be kept in mind during the examination. \nThe paper might be lengthy; there is no need to panic during the exam. Even the best strategies can go wrong if fear overpowers you. Remember, most of the 11 lakh students appearing for the exam could be as afraid as you. It would really help if you stay calm and follow relaxation techniques. \nCertain critical concepts must be explained carefully. \n-While defining electric flux or magnetic flux, the angle between the surface normal and the field should be considered. \n-In AC circuits, instantaneous voltages are added like scalars but peak and RMS voltages are added like vectors. \n-Even convex mirrors may also produce real image if the object is virtual. \n-Always show the direction of rays, the direction of current and label axes and use a pencil to draw figures. \nTry to make the presentation without any cutting and overwriting with neat heading and labelling. \nHere’s a plan to tackle the paper, but use it only if you think it will work for you. It is advisable to start with 5-markers and 3-markers which constitute most of the paper and require elaborate and part-wise answers. This will help build your confidence early on while writing the paper. \nFor 5-marker questions write clearly and answer in points (For example - principle, diagram, construction, working, uses and limitations). Your answers should be short and crisp for 1-mark questions . Though it may not be a strict rule, you should consider writing 4 points in 2-mark questions wherever possible and the most important or inevitable conditions should be presented first. \nTopics added this year: Power factor. \nTopics removed this year: Combination of a Lens and a Mirror, Frequency Modulation, Advantages of frequency modulation over amplitude modulation, Basic Idea about Internet, Mobile Telephony and Internet. \nThe above tips and tricks along with effective time management and relaxation techniques will definitely help build up your score. Good luck! \nThe author is HOD-Physics, Studymate (Hindustan Times Learning Centres) and can be reached at studymate@hindustantimes.com tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T15:26:24.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
