Last fall, Mitch Barnhart announced the upcoming construction of a new $49 million baseball stadium. \nAll the while, John Calipari and Kentucky basketball watched and waited for their turn to come around. On Friday, the UK Board of Trustees approved plans for a $4 million overhaul to the Joe Craft Center , which opened in 2007. \n\"You knew we had to be in line. There's a line because of us,\" Calipari said. \"I didn't mind being last. We just had to be in line. They knew it. So it's good that they're doing it.\" \nIncluded in the renovations plans is the goal to transform \" the existing player locker and shower space, lounge area, and team meeting room into one multi-functional space,\" according to the proposal, as well as \"supplementation and nutrition fueling station\" and \"hydration station.‚Äù \n\"The building's 10 years old. It was built at a time where everything was kind of cut up,\" Calipari said. \"We're in this building 300 days a year, and it was time.\" \nCalipari also voiced his support for upgrading the players dormitory, the Wildcat Coal Lodge, completed in 2012 but already outdated due to the neverending arms race that is college athletics. The coach hinted to a recent report of one prospect's family's criticism of the dorm. \n\"The lodge was built the way it was built because the NCAA told us no a thousand times, and then Taj Mahals were built and they said, 'Well those are fine, though.' We were told no. Believe me, I was in the middle of it,\" Calipari said. \"Joe Craft doesn't wanna hear that the lodge isn't this and this and that. We built what they allowed us to build, and so we'll probably have to go through that again.\" \nKentucky's locker room at Rupp Arena was given a $3.1 million facelift in 2013. The result was a more modern space that should hold up for \"15 to 20 years,\" Calipari said.

This thing gets a lot of wear and tear. So it's 10 years old and I think it's nice what they're doing. It's great for these kids. They're here. They're working. They deserve to feel good.\" Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:51:13.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
