(AAP: Joe Castro) \nIn the third set the Australians did not lose a point on serve. \nThe Czech team were rocked by injury on Thursday with veteran Radek Stepanek, who has won 18 doubles titles on the ATP tour, suffering an unspecified issue. \nSingles specialists Vesely and Satral had no answer to the court nous of Peers, who is ranked sixth in the world in doubles, and Groth, who also frequently plays the format. \nThe Australians got an early break to lead 3-1 and while Peers had an uncharacteristically poor service game to allow the Czechs to break back, that proved to be their only one of the entire match. \nAustralia broke world number 54 Vesely in the first game of the second set and never looked back. \nThey were unstoppable on serve in the third set, wrapping up the match and the tie with ease. \nAAP ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:56:19.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
