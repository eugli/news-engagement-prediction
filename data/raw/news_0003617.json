Both are undergraduates at Colgate University, both serve on the student senate there, and both are frequent contributors to what are intended to be diametrically opposed political columns in The Colgate Maroon News . Despite the similarities in their resumes, the two are used to butting heads over policy and ideology. Cousin (a self-identified progressive) writes in the “What’s Left” liberal opinion column, while Zoellner (something of a Libertarian) frequently contributes to the “Being Right” conservative section. This week, however, the two put aside their differences and the status quo to write columns with a unified message condemning President Trump’s recent executive order regarding immigration. They hope that their bipartisanship will demonstrate the severity of this issue. Point: Immigration may need change, but not this kind of change \nOn Friday, President Donald Trump made good on one of his most incendiary campaign promises and issued an executive order halting all immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days and for all refugees for 120 days. Syrian immigration was halted indefinitely. In doing so, the Trump team cited precedents of 9/11, the Iranian hostage crisis and even World War II, which was not exactly a shining moment in U.S. immigration history. (Photo: Provided by Ryan Zoellner) \nTrump’s decision was cruel, reckless, damning to the U.S.’s reputation abroad and thrown together with the haste and sloppiness of a student racing to meet a deadline. This order uses far too broad a brush in addressing immigration and the threat of terror. As conservatives like Senator John McCain and Senator Ben Sasse have pointed out, it is very likely that Trump’s sweeping actions will represent a boon to the careers of radical jihadist recruiters as the arguments presenting the West’s aversion to Islam will unfortunately become stronger. Not only that, but the stipulation halting immigration of refugees applies to all refugees. The idea of, say, political victims from Nepal or Taiwan being turned away in some effort to address terror based thousands of miles away from them is as gut-wrenching as it is frustrating. \nIt is true that there is executive precedent for temporarily halting immigration from certain countries — Obama did it in 2011 in response to the war in Iraq, and Carter did it in 1980 during the Iranian hostage crisis. Trump team members may soon use the abstract “War on Terror” as a justification, but as far as I’m concerned this is only a loosely cogent argument with regard to state sponsors of terror (only three of the countries singled out by the law). Even then it doesn’t hold much water given the intangible and ill-defined nature of a “war on terror.” Further, the irony of citing 9/11 was apparently lost on Trump, being that 15 of the 19 perpetrators of the attack were citizens of Saudi Arabia — a nation conspicuously absent from the list of blocked countries. \nPerhaps the most senseless element of Trump’s executive order is its application to green card holders — under the order, green card holders will be treated like other immigrants from their regions of the world and thus are barred from entry into the United States if they do not meet nebulous “vetting criteria.” Green card holders have been vetted extensively by the State Department, pay taxes, are expected to take up residence in the States and are told “welcome home” by customs officials. Essentially, the only things they cannot do are vote and run for most public offices. Trump’s orders will mean that such pseudo-citizens will be detained, held indefinitely and possibly sent back to their countries of origin. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has already filed a slew of lawsuits concerning the constitutionality of these measures. You can bet that the undeserved suffering of green card holders across the world will be thoroughly documented in the coming weeks. \nDiversity and inclusion are part of what make the United States so strong. Victories for immigration are victories for the nation as a whole, yet it is true we must be certain that the values of immigrants can mesh with American values; after all, the visa application form still asks if applicants identify with Nazi ideology. Nevertheless, an all-out ban of so many countries and individuals is counterproductive and antithetical to those same American values. It also means that we will be cruelly turning away many of the people who need our asylum the most. Changes in immigration policies may be warranted and should certainly be debated, but broad unilateral action does no good. I hope that the compassion of border agents and customs officials is as legitimate as I suspect it is, and that the exceptions and “discretionary action” outlined by the executive order are liberally applied to allow for immigration as it should be. Related: Scores of universities and academics call for end to Trump immigration order Counterpoint: We must refute euphemisms: This is a Muslim ban \nI am by no means an overtly religious man; I have never committed myself to scripture, or taken much solace in prayer. Yet, I know this much: religion, at its core, is intended to be a binding and unifying force. For this reason, I feel a strong connection to my Jewish heritage and the surrounding culture. Last Friday, during Holocaust Remembrance Day, I took a moment out of my day to remember those who were lost during the Holocaust. At 3:45 p.m. EST, I tweeted , “Remembrance is about more than acknowledging the 10M+ that were lost; it is standing up to ensure we’ll never go back.” (Photo: Provided by Eli Cousin) \nLess than one hour later, at 4:42 p.m. EST, President Donald Trump signed an executive order indefinitely barring immigration from seven Muslim majority nations and suspended admission of Syrian refugees for four months. The timing of this executive order is relevant, it is notable and it is horrifying. As people across the globe remembered the persecution of one religion, we watched our president take steps to persecute another. \nMake no mistake: President Trump’s executive order was deliberately designed to target people of one faith. We must reject any euphemism, refute any alternative label. This is a Muslim ban. \nThe United States of America will not stand for a deliberate attack on any faith or creed. That is exactly what this is. Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that this is not a Muslim ban, but that is simply an “alternative fact.” We know this because Trump pledged to institute a Muslim ban during his campaign, only to walk it back after drawing the ire of Speaker Paul Ryan and other top ranking Republicans (ironically Mike Pence included). We know this because trusted confidant and administration member, Rudy Giuliani, went on-air to reveal that Trump asked him to, “put a commission together, [and to] show me the right way to do it legally.” \nIn the complete text of his executive order, President Trump evokes the horrific attacks of September 11 as a rationale for banning immigration from several Middle Eastern nations. How do we know that this is an absurd justification? None of the 19 hijackers involved that day were from any of the seven countries –– Libya, Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Yemen and Somalia –– that Trump elected to ban. \nWhat is even more remarkable about the seven countries that Trump barred is that these are nations that have, by all statistical measures, posed no domestic threat to the U.S. in decades. Since 1975, there has not been a single American killed by citizens from any of the seven countries that Trump listed in his executive order. We know that Trump is lying when he says, “This is not about religion –– this is about terror and keeping our country safe.” If this executive order was truly about terror, Trump would have banned immigration from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, whose citizens have been responsible for the deaths of more than 3,000 Americans in that same time period. Instead, he passed over these nations, almost certainly because of his publicly known business ties. These are three Muslim majority nations with which the Trump Organization has done or pursued deals. In this action, Trump revealed his true intentions: to impose an executive order centered around religion and built on fear-mongering, rather than combatting more empirically legitimate threats. \nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was spot-on in their analysis of Trump’s order, stating that it is a clear “euphemism for discriminating against Muslims.” You need not be a constitutional expert, nor memorize Emily Lazarus’s Statue of Liberty poem to know that this executive order goes against every fiber of our nation’s history. Not only is it potentially unconstitutional, it is utterly un-American. When we turn away children and families fleeing from disaster, isolate and discriminate our neighbors and turn our backs on those who need us most, we defy the most basic principles of our free and democratic society. It is a frightful moment that questions whether we have lost sight of who we truly are as a nation. \nSo tonight, and in the coming weeks and months, I will do something that I do not typically do. I will take a moment to say a prayer. Both in remembrance of those who were lost, and in the hopes of becoming a nation united, committed to fighting so that we may never go back.
