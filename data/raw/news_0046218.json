He was 73. \nHis publicist, Kurt Nishimura, said Coryell died Sunday in his hotel room of natural causes. Nishimura says he had just performed two shows at the Iridium on Friday and Saturday. \nCoryell grew up in the Seattle area. After taking up the guitar, he moved to New York in 1965. \nCoryell's eclectic career included collaborations with many of the jazz greats, including Miles Davis, Gary Burton, Alphonse Mouzon and Chet Baker. His works often mixed jazz, classical and rock ingredients. \nIn 1969, he recorded \"Spaces,\" his most noted album. Many say it sparked the emergence of the jazz fusion movement. \nCoryell is survived by his wife, two daughters and two sons. Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss \nArmy Lt. Gen. H.R.
