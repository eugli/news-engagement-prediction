The fetal heart, for example, with all of its tiny chambers and valves, is only about 15mm long: less than the size of penny. 'Ultrasound technology – used in all routine antenatal scans in the UK – is actually fairly good at visualising these tiny structures. 'It uses very high frequency sound waves which are reflected back ('echo') from the structures inside the body to produce an image. Unlike ultrasounds, the high-tech scan shows beneath the baby's skin and beats normal MRI scanners by using complex technology to get usable images from even babies who move a lot in the womb. The iFIND project hopes its technology will eventually improve antenatal scans for all mothers-to-be and be rolled out globally. On the NHS, mothers currently undergo a scan only at 12 weeks and 20 weeks unless there are complications The film has been given to video parenting site ChannelMum.com to share with pregnant mums around the world. Dr Lloyd continues: 'In fetal ultrasound, the images produced can be excellent; but unfortunately that's not true for every patient. 'Ultrasound has to be able to 'see' through the body to the parts of the baby we want to image, and that isn't always easy. 'It will depend on the age of the baby, how they are lying in the womb, the size of the mother, and many other factors. 'MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images and can see the structures inside the body regardless of whether there's bone, muscle or fat in the way... Dr David Lloyd 'MRI, which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images, isn't so limited. 'It can see the structures inside the body regardless of whether there's bone, muscle or fat in the way; and in some cases it can give us even more detailed images than ultrasound. 'Importantly, it is also one of the few imaging techniques that is safe to use in pregnancy.' The team behind the new scan were given £10 million by the Wellcome Trust and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) to develop new scans. It is the most cutting-edge scan available to date and is possible due to an algorithm developed by the team. It automatically copes or 'corrects' small fetal movements made by the baby during the scan to create clear images. Private patients have taken advantage of more detailed 3D scans in recent years but the new MRI technology looks set to let soon-to-be parents take a closer look Normally if a baby moved rapidly in a conventional scan - just like the baby here - you would get an unusable image and the mum might have to return for a re-scan. Medics hope to develop the technology so it will eventually involve four probes which automatically move around the top of the mum's tummy to get the best image. It would mean more complications could be picked up earlier and even treated before the baby is even born. Cathy Ranson, editor of ChannelMum.com said: 'Scans are amazing as they help mums, dads and even other family members bond with their baby. 'There is nothing quite as emotional as seeing your unborn child moving inside you, and these MRI scans are taking images to the next level. They are truly breathtaking.' The team behind the new scan technology are from Kings College London, St Thomas' Hospital, Imperial College London, University of Firenze, the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and Philips Healthcare.
