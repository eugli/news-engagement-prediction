Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover are portraying a younger Han Solo and Lando Calrissian respectively. Game of Thrones ’ Emilia Clarke , Woody Harrelson , Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and Westworld ’s Thandie Newton round out the main cast. And while Peter Mayhew did appear as Chewbacca in The Force Awakens , his role in the Han Solo movie is being played by Joonas Suotamo.\nLucasfilm also confirmed that the Han Solo movie, which still doesn’t have a title, will be released May 25, 2018, squashing (for now) speculation that the film would be pushed back to December 2018 . \n“Watching such inspired people from all over the world, with such unique voices, come together for the sole purpose of making art, is nothing short of miraculous,” Lord and Miller said . “We can’t think of anything funny to say, because we just feel really moved, and really lucky.” \nWhile Ehrenreich and Glover’s roles are confirmed, the other actors’ roles are more mysterious. Harrelson is believed to be Han Solo’s mentor while Waller-Bridge’s role is CGI-driven , likely similar to Alan Tudyk’s K-2SO in Rogue One . \nNoticeably missing from the first cast photo is Newton, a later addition to the cast and whose absence is sure to fuel theories about who she might be playing. Newton poked fun on Twitter and noted that she actually is in the photo—but you can’t see her. I'm the huge *invisible* SheBeast next to Chewbacca - BOOM!
