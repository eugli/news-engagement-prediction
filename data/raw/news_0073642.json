Heating and cooling chews up 38pc of your power, while adding hot water makes a total of 63pc of your power bills around the home. Picture: finder.com.au Source: Supplied \nFinder.com.au estimated that heating and cooling — in particular the air temperature of your house and your water for bathing — consumes the most, 63 per cent of your household energy. \nAirconditioners and heaters are more energy inefficient than hot water systems, comprising 38 per cent of the total energy bill. \nFridges and freezers consume seven per cent each, appliances on standby chewing up four per cent and other appliances like TVs equalling a total of 16 per cent of consumption \nHere are the top energy consuming appliances and habits around your home, and how to reduce your use and that quarterly bill. Heating water takes up 25 per cent of home energy bills and is second only to heaters and airconditioning, so limit your showers to three minutes. Picture: Supplied. Source: Supplied HOT WATER Heating water is a heavy drain on energy equating to nearly 25 per cent of all household power usage. If you are building a new house, take the opportunity to place your hot water system closest to the taps that use it the most. And take a shower — as long as it’s not a ten minute affair — as a single hot bath can use more than 100 litres of water. A short, three minute shower can use less than 30 litres of water that you are paying to heat. Set the temperature of your water between 60C and 65C, or as low as 50C for children. Fix any drips — a hot water tap dripping at the rate of 1 drip per second could waste up to $25 in a year. Baths can use up to 100 litres of hot water so should be used sparingly compared with showers which can be restricted to 30 litres. Picture: George Apostolidis.

If the climate trend continues power guzzling air con will be spiralling energy bills upward across the nation. Finder.com.au has some tips to limit consumption while trying to cool down the house. Firstly, do your homework and choose a model by its multi-starred Energy Rating System, such as an inverter unit which is quieter and more efficient. If a hot day is forecast, let cool air into your house the night before Increase your aircon’s temperature by 1C in summer and decrease the reverse cycle by 1C in winter and you’ll save up to 10 per cent energy consumption. Clean the filters every few months to keep them unblocked and efficient If you’re leaving the house for more than an hour, turn the system off Do not cool unoccupied rooms, and close vents or ducts connected to these rooms. Small but powerful, hairdryers can suck up the watts if you use the hottest setting, but energy efficient models can mean big savings on the bills. Picture: Phillips. Source: Supplied HAIRDRYER Hair dryers heat the water in your wet hair to its evaporating point while blowing it away, and that takes a lot of energy. However, the hairdryer’s settings can make a big difference. The hottest setting can use up to 1500 watts of power, whereas the “cool” might only use 70 watts. At 25 cents per kilowatt hour, over a year the difference between the two settings is $1.60 and $34.00. And as with many energy-draining appliances, there are energy-efficient models. Heat lamps should not be used as de facto lights in bathrooms as they use a lot of energy making the heat and should have a separate switch. Source: Supplied HEAT LAMP Other areas of high energy use in the bathroom are heat lamps, which most people turn on with the lights. Heat lamps are highly energy consuming as they’re made to make heat and not light. If you have these installed, they should be controllable by switches independent to those used to light your bathroom. If you have an old, second fridge chugging away in the laundry, get rid of it and watch your power bill drop, whereas new models have super efficient energy ratings. Source: Supplied FRIDGES & FREEZERS It’s the appliance that runs all day and all night, every night of the year. The first lesson is not to place the refrigerator in a sunny window or next to an oven and make its job of keeping cool even more energy intensive. The size of your fridge matters, and the number. If you have an old, second fridge chugging away in the laundry, get rid of it and watch your power bill drop. If you’re buying a new fridge, like the airconditioner its energy rating is important. Four stars used to equate super efficiency, but now some models have up to ten stars. Keep your fridge clean at the back and well-ventilated, and make sure its seals are not decayed, allowing coolness to escape. Standby switches for electronic devices can use energy even when the device is switched off but still plugged in, and laptops can waste $25.90 a year just charging. Picture: Dylan Robinson. Source: News Corp Australia POWER POINTS AND STAND BY Switch appliances off at the power point or unplug them. Standby power or vampire power truly does use electricity. Leaving a PlayStation on standby after using it for just 90 minutes a week can cost you an extra $37 a year in energy use. Whether your appliances are turned on or not, if they are plugged into the wall with the power point on, they are using power. If your laptop is charged, do not plug it in. Charging it for three hours a night can cost you an extra $25.90 a year. Australians have some of the biggest houses in the world and to be really energy efficient per person you should consider downsizing, a worldwide trend. Picture: Stephen Harman Source: News Corp Australia YOUR BIG HOUSE \nAustralians have the largest houses in the world, ahead of Canada and the United States. \nBigger houses use more energy and over the past 60 years Australian homes have more than doubled in size, going from an average of around 100 square metres in 1950 to about 240 square metres today. \nAt the same time, the average number of people living in each household has been declining. This means that the average floor area per person has skyrocketed from 30 square metres to around 87 square metres. \nMore occupants mean less energy per person, as the resources are shared. Just by downsizing your home, a worldwide trend which includes the “tiny homes’ fad in which people live in less than 30 sq m houses on wheels, you can drastically cut power bills. If you have a swimming pool be like Bill Brazier (above) who uses a solar-powered pump to keep his pool clean and efficient. Picture: Paul Riley. Source: News Corp Australia SWIMMING POOL PUMP Not everyone has a swimming pool, but Australia has the highest per capita ownership in the world. And over a year, a pool pump running 24 hours a day can produce as much greenhouse gas as a large car. Using a pool pump for between four and six hours a day can boost your power bill by $1556 a year, finder.com.au calculated. It recommended using a pool cover to reduce evaporation of water that has been processed by the energy draining pump. Reduce the size of your pump, which often may be too big, or use a solar-powered pump. Larger houses mean more energy use and as families reduce in numbers that means more per capita consumption.
