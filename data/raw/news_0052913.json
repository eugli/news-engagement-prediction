(Evan Agostini/Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  00 PM \nIf you were looking forward to a new category of Oscar bests — best presidential Oscar tweets — sadly, President Trump will not be watching the Academy Awards this year. \nA pity, because the tweeter-in-chief had a lot to say about past years' shows. \nHe even offered to serve as host of the ceremony more than once. \nIn 2015, the now-President declared in an Instagram video that he would be the perfect host for the 2016 affair, noting that the Oscars were \"terrible\" under the helm of host Neil Patrick Harris. \nDonald Trump says Meryl Streep 'over-rated' in Twitter rant \n\"I should host the #Oscars to shake things up — this is not good!\" he wrote in 2014, when Ellen DeGeneres hosted the ceremony. \nBy 2016, Trump had already declared his run for president, which unfortunately made his Oscar hosting dream take a backseat. \nWhile White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said this week that the Trumps would likely be too busy at the Governor's Ball on Sunday night to watch the event — there's still hope he'll give us an update the following day. \nAfter all, he did wait hours before giving a calculated response on Meryl Streep's powerful political statement at the Golden Globes, calling her a \"Hillary lover.\" Director Alejandro Inarritu accepts an Oscar at the 87th Academy Awards in 2015. (MIKE BLAKE/REUTERS) \nTrump wrote on Twitter the next morning, \"Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes.\" \nHere's a list of our favorite retroactively presidential Oscar tweets: 2015 Oscars \n\"The Oscars are a sad joke, very much like our President. So many things are wrong!\" \n\"What ever happened to the good old days of The Academy Awards. This show is an insult to the past, just plain bad!\" \n\"Put the glamour, beauty & mystery back in the Oscars and the ratings will zoom. Also, & most importantly, the Oscars need credibility.\" \n\"The Oscars were a great night for Mexico & why not-they are ripping off the US more than almost any other nation,\" he wrote, after director Alejandro Iñárritu's \"Birdman\" won best picture. 2014 OSCARS \nHe retweeted someone who wrote, \"Only 1 solution for the Oscars, Trump as host.\" Actress Meryl Streep gave an impassioned speech about politics during the 2017 Golden Globes. (HANDOUT/REUTERS) \n\"Which is worse and which is more dishonest — the #Oscars or the Emmys?\" \n\"Was President Obama in charge of this years Academy Awards — they remind me of the ObamaCare website! #Oscars.\" \n\"I'm having a real hard time watching the Academy Awards (so far). The last song was terrible! Kim should sue her plastic surgeon! #Oscars,\" he wrote, referring to Kim Novak. 2013 Oscars \nIn 2013, Trump kicked off his Oscar tweeting spree, noting it was requested \"by popular demand.\" \n\"I will be tweeting on the very tainted Academy Awards tonight!\" \n\" Django Unchained is the most racist movie I have ever seen, it sucked!\" \n\"Lincoln never sounded like that!\" A post shared by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Feb 23, 2015 at 8:10am PST \n\"The Oscar broadcast is really boring — where is the glamour and beauty?\" \n\"I don't like the opening even a little bit!\" \nHe even had a few positive things to say: \n\"Anne Hathaway is a good winner!\" and \"Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas look great!\" he wrote, before signing off. \n\"I've had enough of this — good night!\" \nUs, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:36:57.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
