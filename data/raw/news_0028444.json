There comes a point when these talented young men must decide if they are happy floating around the top six, occasionally losing semi-finals or finals, impressing one month and infuriating the next; or can they develop the mentality of winners? \nThe same question should be asked of Tottenham as they meekly lost ground to Chelsea. \nWe must wait before determining if Henderson’s intervention last week defines not only his captaincy, but also Klopp’s reign. At the very least, it should be a turning point in this season’s quest for Champions League qualification. Liverpools Premier League goalkeepers ranked from worst to best \n“It was the team captain who got us together. He wanted it to happen,” explained Adam Lallana, whose performance on Saturday underlined why a new contract beckons. “We knew as players we had to take responsibility. It was up to us to respond. The manager can say as much as he likes and tell us what he wants us to do and what attitude he wants us to have, but we have to do it. \n“Credit to Jordan for calling the meeting, credit to everyone for participating and credit to everyone for performing. It wasn’t just him who spoke, the senior players spoke, the non-senior players, everyone. It was good, and refreshing. \n“As long as it is not personal, just purely professional, there is no harm reminding each other what we need and what we want from each other. It was very open and I came out of that meeting knowing that every one of those players is together and intent on turning things around. There was a sense of everyone coming together.” Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson convened the players' meeting Credit: Action Images/Carl Recine \nT he response was heartening and thrilling and utterly maddening. Is it any wonder Liverpool supporters are tormented when the mood gauge swings so violently between despair and rapture? \nLallana knows the manner of this victory was reaffirming to doubters as much as believers. Klopp’s impressive record against the top six was enhanced. What happens against the next relegation contender in a fortnight will be as revealing. \n“The minute we have a couple of bad results, we are going to keep on answering critics and proving people wrong,” said Lallana. “But losing together can help you in the long run. This run we have been on has brought us closer. It is not one individual against the press or whoever is saying bad things. Let’s dig deep when we have to. It was good. Liddlepool \n“We didn’t have any excuses in January and there were no excuses for our performance against Hull and no excuses for not beating Swansea at home. It is about us proving to everyone that we don’t just perform against the top teams. \n“We know we need to be more consistent. The way we performed here was remarkable.” \nT ottenham’s players need a similar epiphany. There are inescapable similarities between Mauricio Pochettino’s and Klopp’s hopefuls, although the obvious contrast is while Liverpool excel against those at the top, Spurs never seem to do so away from home. \nPochettino echoed Klopp’s view on what separates the champions-in-waiting from pretenders. “Chelsea have a lot of players that know what it means to win and we are creating a winning mentality,” said the Spurs coach. “Sometimes it is not only about pushing the player to train and run, sometimes it is about coping with the competition. Mauricio Pochettino says Spurs are still learning how to cope mentally with being title contenders Credit: Carl Recine/Action Images \n“We are building the project over the last two years. The club is in a special situation – building the new stadium – and there are many things which are important when you analyse the team. \n“If you compare Tottenham with the other sides competing for the top four, maybe you say, ‘Wow, Tottenham deserve a lot of credit for where they are now, huh?’ ” \nI n terms of the title, Antonio Conte was the winner, no doubt relieved Sadio Mané was not around from the start of the recent Chelsea game here to scamper his defenders legs into submission as he did against Spurs. \nThere was also some surprising naivety from Spurs. Liverpool had the chance to counter-attack for the first time in six weeks. You could not help but wonder if the visiting scouts had paid any attention to recent Anfield fixtures? \nKlopp versus Pochettino should one day become a title contest, and Champions League qualification is a fair reflection of fine progress in their second year with promising but developing teams. \nFor now - for both clubs - the disparity between the good and wretched days remains too excessive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:03:25.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
