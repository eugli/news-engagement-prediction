By Sharon Eberson / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nTaylor Robinson, a senior at The Ellis School, stood before the gathering Sunday at Baptist Temple Church of Homewood and explained what it means to be a FAME scholar. \nShe had just been honored for earning straight A’s and receiving the Community and Citizenship Award — two of the many honors bestowed upon students, mentors, staff and board members of FAME, the Fund for Advancement of Minorities Through Education. \nFAME is a college preparatory program representing seven independent schools in the Pittsburgh area. The ceremony Sunday kicked off an initiative of the Baptist Temple Church to provide ongoing recognition of youth accomplishments. \nMs. Taylor explained that during her four-year FAME experience, she has had SAT prep, made networking connections and visited more than 20 colleges. She also had arrived at Ellis without any second-language experience, “and honestly, I was struggling with Spanish. However, FAME immediately stepped in and provided tutoring and extra service learning.” \nIt wasn’t long before she was an A student in Spanish. \nFAME, located at 6031 Broad St., East Liberty, began in 1994, offering pre-college services for African-American students at Ellis, Sewickley Academy, Shady Side Academy, St. Edmund’s Academy, Winchester Thurston School, The Kiski School and Western Reserve Academy. There are currently more than 80 FAME scholars, CEO Darryl T. Wiley said while addressing the BTE gathering. \nWorking with the Rev. Rodney Lyde, sisters Patrice Alaquiva, 28, and Alyse Alexander, 27, organized the event that bridged Baptist Temple Church’s commitment to acknowledging youth achievement and FAME. Ms. Alaquiva began the scholar’s program as a 14-year-old at Winchester Thurston, where today she is associate director of college counseling, while Ms. Alexander is a classroom therapist at Friendship Academy. \nThe church “leads the way in bettering the world around us,” said Ms. Alaquiva. “As third-generation educators and members of BTC. we value the contributions that individuals and organizations make to empower and grow our communities.” \nAmong those recognized for mentoring roles were students from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, representing the National Society of Black Engineers. Jane Nicholson, the assistant general counsel for Highmark, was surprised with an award for her commitment to FAME, an organization that attracts volunteers from throughout the region and is funded by local foundations and grants. \nStudents honored for scholastic excellence Sunday were seniors Ms. Robinson of Ellis and Sterling Myers and Dejuan Webb of Kiski; fifth-grader Jasmine Horton of St. Edmund’s; 11th-grader Dominique Mittermeier of Winchester Thurston; and 10th-grader Eliana Gagnon and seniors Angel Andrews and Brian Foster of Shadyside Academy. \nOther honorees included fourth-graders Nyeemah Cox and Janasia Ferguson of St. Edmund’s (perfect attendance); Ellis 11th-grader Megumi Kivuva (outstanding internship performance); Eric and Erica Roberts (parents award, with scholars at St. Edmunds and Shady Side); and Israel Williams, a sophomore at Pitt and a 2015 Sewickley graduate (most connected alumnus). \nOn a day when she was celebrated with two awards, Ms. Robinson said FAME’s contributions to her success come with a bonus. \n“FAME has connected me with other African-Americans who are as determined as I am,” she said. “These students give a face to the term ‘black excellence’ and are in fact the emerging leaders of today.” \nSharon Eberson: seberson@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1960.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:46:48.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
