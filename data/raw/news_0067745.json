RACHEL CLAYTON Last updated 12:26, February 25 2017 123RF \nIt's not too surprising law professionals are the most bored workers. \nAre you a lawyer, project manager or banker? If so, then congratulations, you have one of the most boring jobs out there. \nA list of the 10 most boring jobs was released by employment specialist Emolument , that asked 1300 workers across 14 sectors if they were bored at work. \nLaw professionals are the least upbeat employees, with 80 per cent saying they were bored at work, and chief executives were just as bored as junior employees. \nEducational professionals were some of the least bored workers. \nBeing legally bored was put down to the repetitiveness of researching cases and rulings in a junior lawyer's working week. \nREAD MORE: * Think you're bored at work? Try these jobs \nThe most entertaining jobs were in research and development (R&D), education, and executive management. Only 45 per cent of R&D workers claimed to be bored at work because they were constantly learning and improving their skills. The survey found little difference between the amount of boredom experienced between entry-level and executive workers across all sectors. MOHAMMED SALEM/REUTERS \nDubai, a beautiful city filled with bored employees. \nIf you work in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) then chances are you're paid one of the highest salaries in the world and therefore don't mind working in the most boring country. \nAt least 83 per cent of workers in the UAE were bored with their job. Interestingly, Italy was found to be just as boring, possibly due to instability and uncertainty in the country's economy since the 2008 financial crisis, which means workers are happy to have any job that pays the bills. \nThe US was third, with 74 per cent of workers saying they were bored at work. \nSwitzerland was the least-bored country, with only 51 per cent of workers surveyed found to be bored. Emolument said this was due to the Swiss finding motivation in work-life balance and the country's high standard of living. \nMost boring professions ranked from most to least boring.
