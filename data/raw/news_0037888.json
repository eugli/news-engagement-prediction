One of Oakley's other longtime targets, Charles Barkley, can't figure out what Oak's problem is. Charles Barkley (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:09 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:09 p.m. ET \nNEW ORLEANS — Former roughneck forward and current Madison Square Garden pariah/martyr Charles Oakley has garnered what feels like endless attention in recent days for his very public spat with Knicks owner James Dolan. Basketball Hall of Famer and TNT NBA analyst Charles Barkley knows how Dolan feels — he has been the target of Oakley trash talk for years now. \nThe thing is, Barkley doesn’t quite know the reason. \n“The guy hates me and I don’t know why,” Barkley said from the green room before kicking off TNT’s All-Star studio coverage here. “But I don’t give it much thought. I don’t know why. I just kind of laugh at it.” \nMORE: 20 worst owners in sports history \nThe enmity Oakley has aimed at Barkley was ramping up before the Dolan-Oakley beef hit MSG on Feb. 8, when Oakley was arrested and banned from the arena for what the Knicks claimed was abusive behavior. (The ban has since been lifted .) On Jan. 31, when Barkley was in the midst of a back-and-forth with Cavaliers star LeBron James, Oakley chimed in on Twitter, writing, “the hater (Barkley) need to stop drinking at work.” \nTwo weeks earlier, the New York Daily News had an item that claimed “a source” close to Oakley said that Oakley wanted to settle the score between the two big men, and that, “Our insider says Oakley proposed that he and Sir Charles could meet in the arena of Barkley’s choosing.” \nMORE: Oakley would rather go to jail than have Knicks act nice \nThere has also been the longstanding claim that Oakley slapped Barkley in the heat of negotiating sessions between the players union and the league during the 1999 lockout. But Barkley said, “We never had a confrontation in public.” \nThere was an on-court tussle between the two in a 1996 exhibition game. Barkley shrugged that off. “(The fight was) like 25, 30 years ago,” he said. “I work with Bill Laimbeer now. We got into a fight, like a real fight, on the court . So I don’t understand, but I don’t give it much thought, to be honest with you. It’s like, every two years, somebody will play me an interview of him bashing me and I kind of just laugh.” \nMORE: Donald Sterling amazed Oakley compared Dolan to him \nIn fact, Barkley added, when Dominique Wilkins had a statue of himself unveiled at Philips Arena in Atlanta, he and Oakley chatted amiably. “We went to it,” Barkley said. “Dominique Wilkins got a statue and we sat at the same table and talked the whole time.” \nAs for Dolan, Barkley suggested the issue between he and Oakley should have been settled by now. \nMORE: Draymond Green says Dolan showed 'slave master mentality' \n“This thing has been an embarrassment for the Knicks,” Barkley said, “it has been an embarrassment for Charles Oakley, it has been an embarrassment for the NBA, to be honest with you. The whole thing is just silly and stupid. I can’t believe this has happened this much longer.” Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:28:25.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
