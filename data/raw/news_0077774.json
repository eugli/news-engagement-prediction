County Howard County Sports Glenelg, South River share 3A/4A East regional wrestling tournament title \nPictures from the 3A/4A East region wrestling tournament at Northeast High School in Pasadena, Md. on Saturday, Feb. 25. (Staff photos by Brian Krista) (Ryan Morse) \nWoody pinned Reservoir senior Tyler Ecker in 3 minutes, 12 seconds to secure the fall and give South River a share of its first-ever regional tournament title with defending champion Glenelg with 131 points. \n“I heard it from at least eight people — pin to tie and be co-champions with Glenelg,” said Woody, who improved to 41-1 on the season with his second-straight regional title. “Usually I don’t go that much tempo so early on in the match, but I’m glad I did this time to pull out the win and the pin for my team.” \nTrenton Puccinelli also won for the Seahawks and earned crucial bonus points in a 12-3 victory over North Harford’s Will Sadowski in the 132-pound championship. \nThe Gladiators, meanwhile, trailed entering the championship round and needed to win all four of their finals matches to even have a shot. Jared Thomas (126 pounds), Max Sotka (160), Garrett Murray (170) and Sam Alsheimer (182) were all victorious, and Thomas and Murray both earned bonus points. Alsheimer broke a 2-2 tie with a takedown in the final 10 seconds to edge Bel Air’s Tom Gomez and put the pressure on Woody to pull through with a fall. (Tim Schwartz) \n“We only had seven guys in the tournament, so with half our lineup to finish tied for first is pretty impressive,” said Glenelg coach Matt Bichner. “A couple guys didn’t wrestle as well as they could have and maybe we could have gotten a couple extra bonus points, but I’m happy. Our guys in the finals wrestled really tough.” \nOld Mill (101 points), Atholton (85) and Broadneck (81) rounded out the top-five teams, while Bel Air (72.5), North County (69), Mt. Hebron (66), Centennial (62.5) and C.M. Wright (43) finished in the top 10. \nBel Air’s Brent Lorin (113 pounds) Arundel’s Nathan Gainey (120), Jason Kraisser (138) and Old Mill’s Chase Pennell (152) won their second consecutive regional titles. \nLorin improved his career record to 86-0 with a first-period pin of South River’s Calvin Brumfield. He picked up a quick takedown and followed with a cement mixer for the fall in 1:47. \nLorin said he’s not focusing on keeping his undefeated streak in tact. Instead, he just wants to get better one day at a time. \n“There’s always that opponent out there that’s going to be better than you,” he said. “That’s why I’m constantly training to get better and better so when I do meet that guy I can beat him. ... I think [winning regionals] is crucial. Getting that top seed matters a whole lot.” \nGainey (32-4) dominated North County’s Casey Payne in a 14-3 major decision victory but was disappointed with his performance. He said he needs to sharpen his game in order to win his second straight state title at next week’s MPSSAA state tournament at the Show Place Arena in Upper Marlboro. \n“It wasn’t one of my best matches,” Gainey said. “I mean, I still performed but I think I got a little too relaxed. ... He got a takedown in the second period and it didn’t tear down my confidence but it upset me a little bit. I know that’s not the type of wrestler I am and I got a little too complacent. Overall, I still dominated but I could do better.” \nThe 2017 3A/4A East regional wrestling tournament seeds are released here.

(Photos by Baltimore Sun Media Group) \nKraisser (36-1), meanwhile, got off to a slow start against Reservoir junior and defending regional champion Todd Del Tufo before turning it on in the second period. He built a 7-0 lead before getting the pin in 3:13. \n“I just started doing my moves,” Kraisser said. “Once I got to mat wrestling — I like mat wrestling a little bit more — and I started opening up the match a little bit.” \nUnlike Kraisser, Pennell (38-2) scored early and often, picking up a takedown in the first few seconds of his finals match against Mt. Hebron’s Ali Pender before getting the fall in 1:47. \nHe said Saturday’s title feels much better than the first. \n“Last year I got a pin in the regional championship too and it just feels great. There’s no feeling like it,” Pennell said. “This is definitely the better one. It’s my senior year and I get to finish out here on top. One more week left.” \nNorth County senior Montez Coleman (31-2) captured the 106-pound title as the No. 1 seed. He held off Atholton sophomore Drew Pruett for a 6-5 victory. \nBel Air senior Scott Miser (44-2) cruised through the 152-pound bracket with two falls and a decision. He beat Edgewood’s Ariq Nixon, who was in his second-straight regional final, by fall in 2:49. \nC.M. Wright junior Wyatt Graham remained undefeated on the season with a 6-3 victory over Old Mill junior Nasir Bakare in the 195-pound championship. Graham entered last year’s regional tournament with an unblemished record before finishing fourth. \nMt. Hebron junior Nick Nordhausen, who was upset in the semifinals at last week’s Howard County tournament, took care of business and scored a late escape to beat Meade senior Christopher Bonilla Arocho, 3-2, in the 220 pound title bout. \n3A/4A East regional tournament results (top-four placers qualify for state tournament): Caption 48th annual Howard County wrestling tournament \nHighlights from all 14 Howard County wrestling tournament championship matches on Feb. 18, 2017.
