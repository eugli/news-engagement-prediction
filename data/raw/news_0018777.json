Get your 30-day Free Trial\nMore than $34,000 has been raised for Florida State offensive lineman Ethan Frith and his family after a late January fire destroyed their family home. Gene Williams/Warchant You've likely heard about or contributed to the GoFundMe account created to assist Florida State offensive lineman Ethan Frith's family, who were victims of a recent house fire. What you may not know Is that the contributions to assist the Friths go well beyond money.\nFormer teachers and a few current students at Frith's high school in Mississippi banded together to help the sophomore lineman and his family. And as the GoFundMe account was getting off the ground, FSU's compliance office was doing its part to make sure the fundraising effort wasn't a potential NCAA violation.\nHundreds of people, over the span of 13 days, have donated more than $34,000 to the family in their attempt to reach their $50,000 goal.\n\"We're just trying to get the word out for the GoFundMe account,\" Frith recently told Warchant and other reporters. \"My mom doesn't have any way to rebuild, and we're just trying to get money into the GoFundMe account to give my little brother and my mom a new place to live.\"\nFrith's family home is in Summit, a small Mississippi town on Interstate 55 about 20 miles north of the Louisiana border. The fire was an early morning blaze on Jan. 26, which Frith said destroyed the home beyond repair. He said his mother, younger brother and family dogs were able to escape the home.\nHis younger brother, Everett, called him that morning to let him know about the fire. It led to Frith sending emails to professors and those within the football program to inform them he was leaving to drive home and check on his family.\nThat same day, the GoFundMe account was created by one of Frith's family members. At first, there was a little bit of momentum until a few FSU players began spreading the link via social media.\nAlthough the intent was pure, there were still some concerns. Fans and boosters asked if their donations would be a potential NCAA violation. Those questions, among others, led to FSU's compliance office and the NCAA discussing the details of the GoFundMe account.\n\"You've got a family member back home and from the discussions I've had, I don't think she fully anticipated the reach of FSU and Seminole Nation in terms of what it could do to step up and support this young man,\" said Jim Curry, who is FSU's assistant athletic director for compliance. \"That certainly plays into the analysis when you sort through all this. This, unfortunately, was a unique situation.\"\nCurry said there have been examples of GoFundMe accounts created to assist student-athletes at other colleges and universities in times of need. The conversations between FSU and the NCAA became about finding a \"sensible approach\" to the situation.\nThe fire itself occurred on a Thursday, and Curry's office was already doing research to present to the NCAA on the following Monday.\nOnce FSU and the NCAA were on the phone, the two sides talked for 20 minutes with the NCAA ultimately determining the GoFundMe account would not violate any NCAA rules.\n\"The finer points centered around the structure of the arrangement and how we proceed moving forward,\" Curry said. \"There was a lot of conversation centered around that and not the incident itself.\"\nSince then, thousands of dollars have been raised to assist the family.\nThere's also what's being done for Frith's family back in Summit.\nKevin Martin, who was Frith's high school coach, said North Pike High's principal sent an email about the house fire asking for people to donate clothes and supplies to assist the family.\n\"Any time something like this happens,\" Martin said, \"you see the best in people.\"\nNorth Pike has a strong football tradition. Its alumni includes current Detroit Lions cornerback Glover Quin Jr., and defensive tackle Vernon Butler, who was the Carolina Panthers' first-round pick in 2016.\nFrith was rated by Rivals as a three-star lineman in 2014. Martin said Frith signing with FSU was both exciting for the school and the community at large.\nMartin has known Frith since he was in junior high. He coached Frith in baseball and football.\n\"He is an extremely humble young man. Always has been,\" Martin said. \"Before I became A.D., I coached him in junior high football and baseball. Even then, he was a hard worker. Once he got into high school and everyone saw he'd have a future in football, even after he signed with Florida State, he was always down to earth.\"\nMartin said Frith, who is 6-foot-7 and 316 pounds, always stood out because of his size.\nHe recalled how Frith was already 6-2 and around 250 pounds in seventh grade. When they'd play other junior high baseball teams, it led to opposing teams asking if he was really a seventh-grade student.\nMartin said Frith never \"joked around a lot\" but always did what he was supposed to do.\n\"He was a kid that was going to be where he was supposed to be when he was going to be there,\" Martin said. \"If they said, 'We're going to line you up at running back,' he would have done it. That's the type of kid he was and still is.\"", "external_links": ["https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/trdgwmh77yaxzf8zhoty)", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/trdgwmh77yaxzf8zhoty", "https://www.gofundme.com/frith-housefire"], "published": "2017-02-10T14:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T10:49:49.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
