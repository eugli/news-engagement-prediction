The Denver Broncos received four of those picks. \nThe Broncos were one of four teams awarded four picks, bringing their total number of picks to 10 for the draft. \nAs noted by Andrew Mason of the team’s official website , here is an explanation of how the compensatory draft pick process works. \nCompensatory selections are determined by a formula that incorporates the net gains and losses from the previous year’s unrestricted free-agent signing period. The formula accounts for the value of the contracts and the production of the players with their new clubs. \nThe Broncos were expected to be hit hard by free agency last year, and they were. Malik Jackson, Danny Trevathan and Brock Osweiler all accepted lucrative contracts with new teams. In response, the Broncos were much quieter than fans have been accustomed to seeing with the free agents they brought in, opting for cheaper veterans such as Jared Crick and Russell Okung. \nThe Broncos have found success with these picks before. The Broncos' 2016 leading rusher, starting quarterback and starting left guard were all compensatory picks from the last two drafts. \n— Nicki Jhabvala (@NickiJhabvala) February 24, 2017 \nThe Broncos were awarded extra picks in the third and fifth rounds and they picked up two more picks in the seventh round. Those picks are late in the draft, but the Broncos were able to find quarterback Trevor Siemian at No. 250 overall just two years ago. \nWith these picks, here is a look at all of the Broncos’ draft picks, which includes four picks in the top 101 selections. \nRound 1: No. 20 overall (Natural) \nRound 2: No. 51 overall (Natural) \nRound 3: No. 82 overall (Natural) \nRound 3: No. 101 overall (Compensatory) \nRound 4: No. 127 overall (Natural) \nRound 5: No. 177 overall (Compensatory) \nRound 6: No. 203 overall (via Tennessee) \nRound 7: No. 238 overall (Natural) \nRound 7: No. 252 overall (Compensatory) \nRound 7: 353 overall (Compensatory) \nThe Broncos now have some serious firepower for the draft. It’s also interesting to note that compensatory picks can be traded this year. In year’s past, that wasn’t the case. The 2017 NFL draft takes place from April 27-29 and will be held in Philadelphia.
