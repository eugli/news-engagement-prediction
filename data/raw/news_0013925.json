After averaging over 32 points per game from for five straight years (2010-2014) the last two years have seen UGA average 26.3 in 2015 and 24.5 in 2016. \nSome of that is due to the quarterback situation where a graduate transfer, Greyson Lambert , started in 2015 after arriving to campus just two months before the season and a true freshman, Jacob Eason , had the reigns in 2016. But all of the blame can't be laid at their feet, especially when you realize how tough it has been to get the Bulldogs' run game going. \nAccording to offensive coordinator Jim Chaney , his group must do a better job of one fundamental element of football. (Photo: Jake Rowe, 247Sports) \n“I think I’d like to see us ultimately block better,\" Chaney said on National Signing Day. \"I think that blocking is a lost art sometimes. We play fast and we do things like that and that’s how we strategically attack defenses nowadays and in a lot of today’s college football but inevitably you have to line up and block somebody. I’d love to leave spring feeling like we’re a much better blocking football team.\" \nThat was something that appeared to get better as the season wore on a year ago. With a third offensive coordinator and line coach in as many years, the Bulldogs averaged just 4.1 yards per carry and 167.5 yards per game for the first eight games of the season. The final five games of 2016 saw UGA rush for over 5.2 yards per carry and 219 yards per game. The Bulldogs also had a 100-yard rusher in each of those final five games. \nPass protection also improved. After allowing 19 sacks in the first eight games, the Sam Pittman's crew allowed just five sacks in the final five games. Not a member?

Pittman secured one of the best offensive line classes on paper in UGA history with the 2017 group, but it's tough to expect a great deal from freshmen at that position in the SEC. \nThe offensive line, however, isn't the only group that needs to do a better job of blocking. When discussing running backs and receivers, Chaney mentioned how the skill player who doesn't have the football must transition from ball carrier to blocker. When are designed for or bounce to the edge, receivers and tight ends must take care of their man to make sure the play is successful. \nFamiliarity with scheme and ball are other areas Chaney said he wants to see the Bulldogs improve, but when the offense takes the field for G-Day in April, the long-time really wants to see that his group has become a group that takes more pride in its ability to block. \n\"There’s a lot of goals as we approach this spring, but the one thing you never want to negate is ball security and physicality,\" Chaney said. \"If we keep preaching that, I feel like we’re heading in the right direction.” \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
