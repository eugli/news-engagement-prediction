The CFDA's \"Fashion Stands With Planned Parenthood\" pins Source: CFDA \nOf course there is reason that the CFDA and designers alike have moved to support the organization in this way, at this time. Currently, Planned Parenthood faces a massive threat from the conservative Trump administration, which has already talked about defunding it. \n\"Civic responsibility is an important CFDA pillar,\" Steven Kolb, CFDA's president and CEO, said in a statement . \"Defunding Planned Parenthood will impact millions of Americans. We will raise awareness and support this fashion week and show that Fashion Stands with Planned Parenthood.\" \nGiven how the fashion industry is largely composed of and focused around women, it makes sense that the threat of defunding would cause alarm. But there are already some people noticing that while fashion has been quick to support Planned Parenthood and actions like the women's marches, it's remained disturbingly mum about the travel ban implemented by Donald Trump . \nIn a time when so many organizations and people are in peril, it'll be interesting to see how each individual designer reacts with their own collections this week.
