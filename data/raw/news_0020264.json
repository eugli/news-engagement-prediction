Chris Rumph - Florida \nSmart and Rumph coached together at Alabama from 2011 to 2014 where the Crimson Tide posted some of College Football’s best defenses and won a pair of National Championships. From a relationship standpoint, it makes sense but Rumph also coached with his current boss, Jim McElwain , in Tuscaloosa. Still, this is a name that seems to have a little buzz early on. (Photo: Ryan Jones, 247Sports) Ben Albert - Duke \nThe connection here is with Mel Tucker . Albert was there a year when Tucker was defensive coordinator in 2010. Prior to joining the Duke staff in 2016, Albert was at Boston College for three years. In 2015 the Eagles led the nation in total defense at just over 254 yards per game. Bo Davis - N/A \nAfter resigning from his post at Alabama back in April, Davis spent 2016 with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He and Smart worked together at Alabama twice -- from 2007-2010 and from 2014 - 2015. Davis was reportedly being investigated by the NCAA for impermissible contact with recruits. He was the No. 2 recruiter in the country per 247Sports Recruiter rankings after the 2016 cycle. Chris WIlson - Philadelphia Eagles \nWilson is no stranger to UGA. He was with the Bulldogs during the 2013 season and helped the Bulldogs improve the run defense from 12th in 2012 to sixth the next season despite losing a pair of seniors. Wilson spent his first year in the NFL in 2016 and was at USC the two years prior to that. He has also coached at Mississippi State and Oklahoma. David Turner - Texas A&M \nA veteran of the conference, Turner is as well-respected in the SEC as any position coach. He has spent time at Vanderbilt (2002-2005), Alabama (2006), Mississippi State, (2007-2009 and 2013-2015), and Kentucky (1993-1994 and 2010-2012). He also has stops N.C. State, Virginia and Minnesota. While there isn’t a connection with Smart, Turner is a rock-solid recruiter and coach who has a lot of experience in the Southeast. \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
