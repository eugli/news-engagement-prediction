But for this critical play, with the Potomac Valley Athletic Conference hanging in the balance, he was a wide receiver running a fly pattern into the open floor. Nadev Kalender lobbed the pass, Knapp caught it over his shoulder and then converted a layup through contact to permanently put the Lions ahead in a 76-65 win over Sandy Spring in Rockville on Saturday night.\nKnapp, who is signed to play at Cornell next year, finished with a game-high 40 points. The Wildebeests (24-7) were led by Malakai Parker’s 27 points, but they weren’t enough to edge Jewish Day (24-3).\n“It means everything, it just really means everything,” Knapp said. “We worked so hard for this, and I just couldn’t be happier for this win for all the seniors and the whole team.”\nKnapp started a bit slow before exploding for 23 first-half points. He collected them by rising up off the dribble, cutting into open space and canning catch-and-shoot threes. But the game was still tied 31-31 at halftime, due in large part to Parker’s four first-half threes, and Knapp challenged his team at the break. \n“I told them that we were playing horrible and that it was still tied,” Knapp said. “So if we just fixed our stupid mistakes, we’d be able to win the game.”\nHis teammates responded by involving themselves in the offense. Daniel Zweben scored 14 of his 16 points the second half, Kalender netted 10 of of his 14 and Knapp applied the finishing touches. \nHolding a one-possession lead in the final minutes, Knapp danced around Sandy Spring defenders to kill time. Then he deftly cut backdoor for a reverse layup, converted off of Kalender’s football pass, and added two more points at the buzzer for good measure. \nAfter a hoard of Jewish Day fans mobbed Knapp at halfcourt, Lions Coach David McLoud pulled his star player into a bear hug by the team’s bench. \n“You did it,” McLoud said, leaning close into Knapp’s ear. “You wanted it, and you did it.”\n\nMcLean girls beat Oakcrest for PVAC title \nSydney Lewis crossed to her left, crossed back to her right and then euro-stepped through the lane before banking a layup off the backboard and into the net.\nAfter the game, the freshman had no clue she had scored 16 points. Nor could she explain where the move came from. All Lewis was sure of was that McLean (21-2) had won the PVAC championship in its first visit to the title game. The Mustangs did that with a 47-39 win over Oakcrest (15-8), and Jessica Baskett added a game-high 16 points. \nOakcrest was paced by 12 points from Colleen Beatty and 11 from Julia Rudy . But the Chargers could not overcome McLean’s airtight defense in a 20-10 fourth quarter. \n“This game showed how tough we are,” Lewis said. “We were down, we were up, but we stuck together, and I think we all knew we could do this from the start of the season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T05:50:27.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
